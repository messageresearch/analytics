[38:06] brethren you have no need that I write
[38:08] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[38:10] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[38:12] thief in the night for when they shall
[38:14] say peace and safety then sudden
[38:16] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[38:19] upon a woman with child they shall not
[38:22] escape but ye brethren are not in
[38:25] darkness that that day should overtake
[38:27] you as a thief ye are all children of
[38:30] the day and we are not of the night nor
[38:34] of darkness therefore let us not sleep
[38:37] as do others but let us watch and be
[38:39] sober for data at sleep sleep in the
[38:42] night
[38:42] did I be talking a drunken in the night
[38:45] I'm a good Isaiah chapter 2 verse 11
[38:53] God speaks the lofty looks of man shall
[38:56] be humbled and the haughtiness of men
[39:00] shall be bowed on and the Lord alone
[39:05] shall be exalted in that day for the day
[39:09] of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every
[39:11] one that is proud and lofty and upon
[39:16] everyone that is lifted up and he shall
[39:20] be brought low Isaiah chapter 13 we're
[39:25] in verse 6 wholly for the day of the
[39:32] Lord is at hand it shall come as a
[39:35] destruction from the Almighty therefore
[39:37] shall all hands be faint and every man's
[39:41] heart shall melt and he shall be afraid
[39:45] pangs and soul shall take a whole of
[39:48] them they shall be in pain as a woman
[39:53] that travail it they shall be Amin is
[39:56] one at another the official shall be as
[39:59] flames oh praise the Lord let's continue
[40:04] 6011
[40:09] behold the day of the Lord cometh crewel
[40:12] boot rat and fierce anger to lay the
[40:15] land desolate he shall destroy the
[40:17] sinners their own out of it for the
[40:19] stars of heaven and the consolation
[40:22] thereof shall not give their light the
[40:24] Sun shall be darkened in the going forth
[40:26] and the moon shall not cause a light to
[40:28] shine and I will punish the world for
[40:32] the evil and the wicked for their
[40:34] iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy
[40:37] of the proud to cease and I will lower
[40:40] the haughtiness of the terrible let us
[40:42] borrow his heavenly father we read your
[40:44] word and Lord is just such an
[40:46] interjection at this point in time how
[40:49] this message came and what you gave me
[40:50] to say to the people Lord may you
[40:52] inspire take me out of the way and Lord
[40:55] I only speak what you want me to speak
[40:56] in Jesus name I ask it Amen I mean when
[40:59] you may be seated or praise the Lord
[41:01] amen
[41:02] praise God hallelujah glory to God I
[41:07] will contact Scripture provision 612 and
[41:10] I beheld and yet opened the sixth seal
[41:12] and lo there was a great earthquake and
[41:14] the Sun became black as sackcloth of
[41:16] hair and the moon became as blood title
[41:20] this morning is the day of the Lord as
[41:23] the title is one the day of the Lord I
[41:25] feel is the message the warning and God
[41:30] always send warning before judgment but
[41:33] before he sends a warning he always made
[41:34] a provision for you to escape whatever
[41:36] is coming because something is fixing to
[41:39] break for something is fixed in the seat
[41:41] please
[41:48] how can God give power question how can
[41:52] God give more than someone who doesn't
[41:53] know him looking for power but how could
[42:01] God gives someone power who doesn't know
[42:04] him who doesn't have a relationship with

[1:48:25] that many waters is a voice of The
[1:48:27] ministers the voice of the preachers the
[1:48:29] voice of many waters the voice of the

[1:48:59] into heaven how do you get in by Christ
[1:49:01] Jesus one door one way any man can climb
[1:49:05] our way and the other we see him as a
[1:49:07] thief and a robber and in the parable a
[1:49:09] beagle of the one who climb up and was a
[1:49:11] wedding supper without the garment on
[1:49:12] was found guilty was bound and cast into
[1:49:15] outer darkness only one way I believe I
[1:49:18] preached here not long ago whenever
[1:49:20] somebody gets married in the old country
[1:49:22] he given invitations himself he has to
[1:49:24] furnish the robes and when he met this
[1:49:27] man sitting there how many remember the
[1:49:28] parable he found a man at the supper
[1:49:31] table without a wedding garment on what
[1:49:33] is it the bridegroom stands at the door
[1:49:36] and all who comes up with an invitation
[1:49:38] no man can come to the Father except by
[1:49:41] me and when they come to the invitation
[1:49:43] so that everybody will look alike look
[1:49:46] alike
[1:49:47] not you bet on who and who look alike
[1:49:50] watch watch whether they are rich or
[1:49:53] poor bond or free black or white male or
[1:49:56] female they are all one in Christ Jesus
[1:49:58] and the bridegroom stood at the door and
[1:50:00] received the invitation and put the rope
[1:50:02] around his fellow so the rich and the
[1:50:04] poor all look alike that's the way it is
[1:50:07] in the kingdom of God there's no big
[1:50:09] guys and little guys there's only one
[1:50:11] guy one Christ Jesus wanted Christ or
[1:50:14] literally that so this money came to
[1:50:17] this back door and the master came as a
[1:50:19] friend how did you get in here when oh
[1:50:21] my god alone Jesus citizen
[1:50:24] self he said he called to the port of
[1:50:26] dynein foot on hand he was cast into
[1:50:29] outer darkness where there was weeping
[1:50:31] and wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:50:32] that's Christ's own words he was cast
[1:50:34] out because it proved there we go
[1:50:36] without the wedding garment he comes
[1:50:38] some other way besides the door because
[1:50:41] if he come to the door he would have
[1:50:42] received the wedding garment he said oh
[1:50:44] listen to this
[1:50:45] then if the wedding garment is the
[1:50:48] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:50] how our weaver will be going to be

[1:51:13] here's one when I get to Revelation 1:10
[1:51:17] 3:13 I want you to notice the voice that
[1:51:20] he heard speaking to him had the
[1:51:21] clearness of a trumpet you know how our
[1:51:24] trumpet sounds it gave a shrill song
[1:51:26] what does a trumpet mean question in the
[1:51:31] Bible what does a trumpet mean war any

[1:51:38] the by the time it is a songul meant a
[1:51:41] war then he went further either a
[1:51:45] revelation or something to take place so

[1:53:12] air so that they will have no more
[1:53:15] effect upon them they have to hear it

[1:56:19] it goes from over the head of the limb
[1:56:22] it takes those unlearn that don't know
[1:56:26] very much to understand it but when you
[1:56:28] try to figure it out you can't figure it

[1:58:01] talking about
[1:58:02] if God don't deliver you you're still
[1:58:05] staying with the world because the world

[2:13:29] amplified prayer as well pray have
[2:13:32] volume on it
[2:13:33] oh let's continue it is such a fast that
[2:13:38] I have chosen a different afflicted soul

[2:13:45] to spread sackcloth and ashes under you
[2:13:48] we don't call this a fast unacceptable
[2:13:51] later the Lord is not this the fast that
[2:13:53] I have chosen what for to lose the bands
[2:13:56] of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens
[2:13:59] to let the oppressed go free and to
[2:14:02] break every yoke is it not to deal I
[2:14:09] rented the hungry that don't bring the
[2:14:11] poor that are cast all to thy house when
[2:14:13] those here's the naked that don't cover
[2:14:15] him and on a high not thyself on my own
[2:14:17] flesh then shall thy light break forth
[2:14:19] as the morning then he'll shall spring
[2:14:22] forth speedily
[2:14:22] the health and thy righteousness shall
[2:14:25] go before thee the glory of the Lord
[2:14:27] shall be your rear award then thou shalt
[2:14:29] call and the Lord shall answer though
[2:14:31] shalt cry and he shall say Here I am
[2:14:34] if thou will take away from the midst of
[2:14:36] thee though you can put it for the
[2:14:37] finger and speaking vanity if thou draw
[2:14:40] thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the
[2:14:42] afflicted then that child I light rise
[2:14:45] in obscurity my darkness appears the
[2:14:48] lonely and the Lord shall Kinkaid he
[2:14:50] continually and satisfy thy soul and
[2:14:53] drought and make fact I bones and thou
[2:14:55] shall be like a watered garden like the
[2:14:57] spring of water whose waters feel not
[2:14:59] until I shall be of thee shall build
[2:15:02] always places though shall raise up the
[2:15:04] foundations of many generations and thou
[2:15:07] shalt be called the repairer of the
[2:15:09] breach to restorer of paths to dwell in
[2:15:13] we have a great ministry ahead a great
[2:15:17] call in the head but it's a cost that
[2:15:21] goes with it I'm almost done Ezekiel 33
[2:15:26] reading from verse 1 again the word of
[2:15:29] the Lord came unto me saying son of man
[2:15:31] speak to the share of Israel and send to
[2:15:33] them when i bring the sword upon a land
[2:15:35] if the people of the land take a man of
[2:15:40] their coasts and set him for their
[2:15:44] Watchmen well he see the sword come upon
[2:15:49] the land he blow the trumpet and warn
[2:15:51] the people then whosoever here at the
[2:15:54] strong of the trumpet
[2:15:56] not warning if the sort come and take
[2:15:58] him away his blood shall be upon his own
[2:16:00] head he heard this song of the trumpet
[2:16:03] took not warning his blood shall be upon
[2:16:06] him but he that taketh warning shall
[2:16:09] deliver his soul but if the watchman see
[2:16:13] the sword come and blown up the trumpet
[2:16:16] and the people be not warned if the
[2:16:20] sword come and take any person from
[2:16:22] among them he is taken away in his
[2:16:25] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[2:16:28] the watchman's hand
[2:16:29] oh so this give a different perspective
[2:16:33] now of this trumpet to be blow if the
[2:16:39] watchman don't know the trumpet and
[2:16:41] things happen God require at the
[2:16:44] watchman's hand the man so son of man
[2:16:48] so now verse 7 so so daro Solomon I have
[2:16:53] set thee a watchman unto the house of
[2:16:57] Israel therefore thou shalt hear over at
[2:17:00] my mouth and warn them from me when I
[2:17:05] say unto the wicked a wicked man
[2:17:07] don't shall surely die if thou dost not
[2:17:10] speak to warn the wicked from his way
[2:17:13] that wicked man shall die in his
[2:17:17] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[2:17:20] thine hand nevertheless if the warn the
[2:17:24] wicked of his way to turn from it and he
[2:17:26] turn not from his way he shall die in
[2:17:29] iniquity but that was delivered I saw
[2:17:31] therefore thou son a man speak under the
[2:17:35] house of Israel does he speak sin if our
[2:17:39] transgression of all still be upon us
[2:17:41] and we finally holy shall we live say
[2:17:43] unto them as I live saith the Lord I
[2:17:46] have no pleasure in the death of the
[2:17:48] wicked but are the wicked till from his
[2:17:50] way and live tell me from your evil ways
[2:17:54] why will you die Oh hopes of Israel so
[2:17:58] if you see from these scriptures
[2:18:00] whatever burden for people to really
[2:18:01] repent
[2:18:02] because he wants to forgive he wants to
[2:18:05] restore he wants to heal he wants to
[2:18:08] bless do you believe that Isaiah 21 11
[2:18:12] 12 the building of Duma he call it at me
[2:18:14] or the shear watchman what are the night
[2:18:16] watchman one of the night the watchman
[2:18:18] said the morning coming and also the
[2:18:20] night if he/she will inquire inquiry
[2:18:23] return come on in brother branham preach
[2:18:26] a message watch my one a night he says
[2:18:28] and there is talking about as soon as we
[2:18:31] get washed up and groomed up talk but
[2:18:33] people this traumatising we will meet at
[2:18:35] the tavern as usual and I'm sure John
[2:18:37] you are you all this to buy body message
[2:18:40] be here today
[2:18:40] watch my mother tower trying to make a
[2:18:42] tick to joy or door life gonna tell us
[2:18:44] there's a push in danger
[2:18:45] because he was finally tower he seen
[2:18:47] something and these people want the
[2:18:49] party they want to drink and whatnot so
[2:18:51] he talking about people who talking
[2:18:52] about it with this watchman want to take
[2:18:54] away the joy from us he said know what

[2:19:06] said I would refuse to be alarmed about
[2:19:08] any of this stuff that this watchman
[2:19:09] would talk about all rabbis know about
[2:19:11] this or pastors and so on we believe
[2:19:14] that there will be a possible chance to
[2:19:15] Watchmen could be right or this warning
[2:19:19] thing and warning thing you know we
[2:19:22] don't have to take that so seriously do

[2:19:29] to have a forewarning of it many times
[2:19:31] that loved ones before passed on across
[2:19:33] the other side a warning comes to them
[2:19:36] hallelujah Watchmen must be on duty at

[2:21:17] closing I know you like read a lot of
[2:21:19] scriptures tonight but this is what I
[2:21:22] got fishy about you tonight know what
[2:21:24] trumpet
[2:21:27] shake yourself hallelujah 2nd Peter 3:9
[2:21:31] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[2:21:33] promise as some men count slackness but
[2:21:35] is long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[2:21:38] that any should perish but all should
[2:21:40] come to repentance and Hebrews 12 this
[2:21:43] is all a scripture who is 18 for you are
[2:21:46] not coming to the mount that might be
[2:21:48] touched that Boone would fire no under
[2:21:51] blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[2:21:53] the soul of a trumpet and the voice of
[2:21:56] words which voice be heard entreated
[2:21:59] that the word should not be spoken to
[2:22:01] them anymore for they couldn't endure
[2:22:03] that what was commanded so if as much as
[2:22:05] a beast touch the mountain it shall be
[2:22:07] stoned of trust to it at that so
[2:22:09] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[2:22:11] exceedingly fear and quake but he were
[2:22:12] comment amongst I am under the city of
[2:22:15] the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[2:22:16] and into an innumerable company of
[2:22:19] angels that
[2:22:20] General Assembly and the Church of the
[2:22:22] firstborn which are written in heaven
[2:22:24] and to God the judge of all and to the
[2:22:26] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[2:22:28] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[2:22:30] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[2:22:33] speaketh better things another leader
[2:22:34] see that they refused on him that
[2:22:36] speaketh for if they escaped not to
[2:22:38] refuse him and speak on it how much more
[2:22:41] shall be not escape if we turn away from
[2:22:42] it must be from heaven whose voice men
[2:22:45] shook the earth but now he had promised
[2:22:46] yet once more I shake that little only

[2:51:01] a very difficult delicate job of taking
[2:51:07] care of the Prophet when the Prophet was
[2:51:10] ministering on the prayer line you know
[2:51:13] and he had the job to take with a random
[2:51:14] off from the pulpit and he said he was
[2:51:18] very cautious because he didn't want to
[2:51:19] take him off too soon and he couldn't
[2:51:23] afford to leave him for too long and he
[2:51:25] said one time he took his that off the
[2:51:28] line and as they were driving his father
[2:51:31] was continuing the prayer line he was
[2:51:35] driving away and he was continuing the
[2:51:37] prayer line he knew who was next in line
[2:51:39] he was no longer in the building but
[2:51:42] he's like the next person the condition
[2:51:44] is this and the Lord is healing you
[2:51:46] right now and he was continuing the
[2:51:48] prayer line and he wasn't even in the
[2:51:49] building because you're know anything
[2:51:51] was upon him that's how much God cares
[2:51:53] for his children and under this
[2:51:57] anointing as you leave this building
