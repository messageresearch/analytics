time you may be seated hallelujah praise God well I have to put a course to do tonight where is God hallelujah yet was the I feel so good tonight brother anything can happen tonight just get some faith glory to God hallelujah this convention is really special right from the very possibly is fire fire fire and that's how I know is the holy convention because every sacrifice must be made by fire and brother God has to provide the fire you bring your sacrifice but God provides the fire so we're thankful for all the meetings God has been so good to us it provided fire and tonight is the last and final fire the fire will fall every disease sorry consume tonight you've got to believe that hallelujah if you hit now in answer MA there is he [Music] I tell people sometimes you have issues you can handle the only way out is by faith so faith is not a suggestion is the most you can come to these meetings without issues only you and you are asking can I believe will I be healed will I be delivered will I receive the Holy Ghost is no suggestion you have to believe the result things are possible to them to believe if how comes believe as many times people don't know how to believe and that's why when you receive the Holy Ghost gonna to to sort of believe to believe text willingness say man God is moving in the days of Jesus if you go to the Gospels that's blind bartimaeus like butter by the Peters first opening message Jesus methodology knew they will seek denied even but it will always wait for them to cry he will wait until faith is expressed because they have to be willing to be healed so willingness is when you will leave your face and go will see to what extent are you willing to what extent can you push so you can come to these meetings and just relax you think well it will happen but where is your faith I came two nights already unknown take the Holy Ghost is upon me tonight if you are just willing you can go back with your diseases you can go back in your same stage we are going back home change because God is more than willing to deliver you to set you free to have ties you with the Holy Ghost this is God's program this is God's idea this is God's Way [Applause] but the question is do you believe may be seated we woman cable the issue bloody is bleeding doctors and physicians are exhausted all that she had she had only one off the Messiah would the son of man as you came in faith she spoke from within ourselves and inside revelation if I can only push to him of his coming I saw him at all a pastor did not tell her that a bishop did not tell her that for so this pocket inside a cedar where's girl can somebody shout hallelujah I don't know what seed you came here with tonight but if you came with a rights either you can't go up up the same way let me see it [Applause] I'm just telling you to believe but you can sit there tonight and be an onlooker in the kingdom it doesn't work like that we must understand the principles of the kingdom how things work in the kingdom [Music] the devil is on their own I wish you can hear what I hear tonight the bear isn't wrong [Music] [Applause] listen it twelve years and when she came was an obstacle to her faith she met her place there was a good excuse to see well I've done I or like let me go back we know what she pressed up Willie that was how willing she was to be here not just really what she expressed a willingness I will do all it speaks and jesus said your face as very hold we whipped back God anointed by the revelation nobody bright comes to the thought fries were Halstead our servant of faith must pick up healing and forgiveness and that's how I committed his meetings because we can't have genuine free without that faith having forgiveness and the healing because all to the scriptures all those who are faith when Jesus made them that we are healed and their sins are forgiven them so tonight don't come here on fluency up or put your heart this is a holiday today convocation Gordon speak to your situation tonight thank you Jesus sort of think of what a pity channeler [Applause] representation by predestination if we put just one screech all those messages into all interface like our trim but all this afternoon the way presented the book of life right from the mind of Elohim the foreknowledge the backpack you can find those things in the man's message pass see but I was saying the Bible said in to 40 of the seals see God as a presented as a thought but it has to become your fault that's right so forces is God's thought but by his grace I presented to you but we could have order thought or till God makes it your thought when we comes your thought you understand your own way if not yours that is what you call understanding so what is that this morning you see if you can finalize the perfect message we have and we'll tell the others those two groups of the Angels are all open that up to let you see the tree structures in the book of life you can find those in the man's message but when he spoke this morning it opens you understanding that was his thought some talking on us mediums hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus because until we speak back this message with our thought it cannot be yours so we with the coats we hold on to the coat but all those caught these are abundance thoughts the Prophet had to sell things in a way you can find the same things all through the Bible in a way how to see them that was a sport and we pick up his thought you with this coach will put a balance thought there's no evil to you it can't work for you until you come to a season you understand in opens it becomes your thoughts and when you speak it back the devil knows it's your thoughts God has transformed his poor your thoughts then it goes the power then you know that you know nobody can check it on that as we deal to you it's a part of your system it's part of your spirit it's part of your mind it's know you it is open to you praise God hallelujah propeller channela representational destination Adam represented uniform it seemed the assumption was imputed to you to your account become a sinner the representation that you give you faith believes that the only way to become God's righteousness is by representation it will take your effort it would be no because Jesus Christ already who represented you can somebody shout hallelujah so the little list is out representation bipu destination let me see them but I put a thank you very much our affinity toward evidently so way back before the beginning try it back to an angel of the Lord because without Jesus forgive identity this week he gives power and strength filling up with a vision is that unlike what is here you can fail you can't pass life you can die can somebody say hallelujah somebody say hallelujah that you only to be deemed of angels those angels have presented you and if your angel was in deceived you can't reduce you down here and then God my angel was not deceived my agent occlusive out of heaven not somebody shout hallelujah and that is why I'm here tonight that is why you are here tonight because OHL was never deceived it took side with my job you have to believe this judge so we're gonna give you faith [Applause] so telly Louie are you put your mind there because these things we tell you you're he must pose it wasn't me at all so you can count on your with thing we're too well taught we understand how we all step it out speaking Spanish look man look don't you're fatigued way because something is getting me out of the way anyway let's quickly turn to st. John 15:7 we are going to enjoy the work tonight and send you one one one two for our good for the minister's messages on this way please okay this is a bit weak st. John 15:7 if we abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here one is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so if you abide in me and my words abide in you which words send you one one so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man so in this balance now father we thank you for your Holy Week you just wait your world we just want to enjoy the word tonight I just pray Lord that the Holy Ghost overcome behind the world and just bless God your people let the sick be healed lame walk cripples walk we thank you for everything Lord in Jesus name we pray amen I offer what tight for a subject inspiration the spoken word is the original see mr. Chris Cole Alleluia that's my title that my subject that's my inspiration praise God Alleluia so thank you for the father Peter and then the couplet Peter came who next but I Isaac possessing you individual inheritance that was amazing please God and how can I be represented the bride not even a tried individual took the leg Alleluia develop link in the eternal church at the end of the seals and many guys don't even believed it but as the bride has an age after the seventh age you have a bride age the Holy Ghost age and that the capstone only comes to the Holy Ghost because if you can get to that age you can even be in the rapture but the capstone does it come on Drive the capstone comes to the Holy Spirit praise God somebody say hallelujah praise God a man somebody's there heaven hallelujah also we have to move up to that slop the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost become Holy Ghost people in in that's not so human species dies out if you compare God pain if we can put down the capstone this is no church this is bride I am NOT talking to touch I'm talking to bride so if you're in the right you have an eternal touch age a bride age o Holy Ghost a [Applause] hallelujah praise God and seven Thunder give you faith to believe this Perelman's Edith I did it but a cupid Isaac and that's what Isaac came who I think I'm activate sons with manifest a father but a Raymond I'm blown out yesterday night I was blown out by what I saw and I was saying God can anybody leave here without the Holy Ghost God God who filled the house oh praise God hallelujah let me thank God also for this morning but although the evening the morning the first day is many things but all those put in this message you would like to come behind them and see if you think back to you and see how it goes well I have a spoken word you know serious issues I just wait to you that if my word abide in you ye abide in me can ask what you will I mean where we can go find a son this message this is a public authority commitment spot you can ask anything and it shall be done that's your calling before the rapture so God must find a season son a season bride who can export a wheel and God says it shall be done but to do that is worthless was applied because that is poking what power your words to return void anymore once you stick it there come to pass can somebody say magnetars very profit will sit have I ever told you anything only one man can say that I've I ever told you anything there is no come to pass and you know we can say is there's no everything is tupac has Tashia the Lord came to pass a son can somebody shout hallelujah if we are going back to that that is my vision that is what I'm looking for that's not touch this is right organs somebody say hallelujah but it's to help these most of the world the world by which God created all things is it that's where our there must be an amateur God on the earth because it was given a commission be fruitful and multiply but it was only a seed of the world consumerism analyser and I would also this morning it was given a seven the rest but whoever all lot my wall is one now come he moves for let's labor to enter into the race that miss Adam had to let off can somebody's Hermes nachos because you can bring fruit without his original scene it was only a seed of the world but the one itself in its entirety by which God grated all the things was the logos the fullness of Christ Christ is before all things and by him all things consist and if you had said all things by myself Alleluia praise God so that was the original seed by we've got Twitter all the things the look of seen Jesus Christ fullness let me see this and God took that seed he kept virtually the service here a seed by which when that see Sphynx in you it can come back boy [Music] hallelujah praise God it was like that scene that the Sun was created the moon wherever we have and the last image the stepped out of the seed was a man and the image likeness of God hallelujah where is God Oh somebody help me show tonight some heavy so tonight hallelujah praise God we have come into that's easy now when God shall give the trust back apostolic Authority when we shall speak our words will go forth like lightning but you must understand how to come to that is it it but a three-album little preachy I miss you [Applause] I'm an Amazon the earth I'm here under the story hidden story Adam was placed in Eden's God's paradise she was not just an earthly creatures it was an identity creatures could be neither that was the headquarters of the earth and it was given a commission be fruitful multiply we produce your kind because you see it's by the world that God created the monkey the baboon all the screens you see but why are they all different in the appearances because you must know the seed by the kind because the seed is got to be inferred after it so it is a kind that if I have seen so you must know your kind to understand your fear is your disease might look alike but a kind that's what I'm so concerned about my kind not just obviously through similar for the kind because a kind if I have seen the kind defines both bubbles there was a Nazira now suppose you have never seen a mango tree all you ever see know is a mango seed what what resemblances between the seed and the tree never the remote OMSI Sarah see the thought I have towards you the intentions the potholes you can see those thoughts they attribute maybe a syncope to proceed so when the pork doesn't transform to see God's powers God's intention that was in that she shows up so when you see a mango tree that big tree came out of a small seed and the scene itself doesn't even look like the tree when I was the seed bringing forth after its kind and even among mangoes there are different species of mangoes so what I'm saying that is we all Christians by our kind our species different who are not just a regular Christian can somebody show panel or honor no no no you are not a regular believer break your tiny difference you are God came passing a God can believer a God can question Oh somebody shots are a lawyer somebody shout hallelujah [Applause] so not just the same what is PC machining father we recommend you see time and when we hit G time you must be a real cedar with a real client to be part of this pride our somebody shout hallelujah I am so happy praise God we are part to see time we're about to kind of time but our real time is either see God by the word did every creation a scene he created it gave me to see then he said let every scene out to eat now what if you don't know the kind that you can take any kind of a seed ah but if you're the kind does in that seed so so what kind is you see because if you don't know you're kind of a see how do you know really who you are simply get it if you don't know what kind is a seed how do you know we knew you are so now listen close everything good cricket is the Word of God call it the punch or the demolish that is all the word so they're all like seeds because God's Word is a sieve but then it came down to where God created man in his own image after is unlikely it was God's image and go likeness that makes him fully complete God if we a cute everything that makes God God was in that man and God put them on oh they had to be an amateur God to exercise cause attribute his authority there's a different species different man and got all this man be food for bring forth after your kind Adam was given the sevenson the tie to did book brunch in that book was one how to make sons so God has a cold how to make sense it was locked up in that book it would add the magic much majority to speak a word of songs and that was how we are supposed to come not in this condition we are in now we are struggling to believe simple simple things was to be born I would faith because faith was to be and that's one thing to you to believe that God heals should be normal like Jesus Christ he doesn't need to struggle to work on top of the water because that was his nature that was OB was Oh somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah let me see that was only Wars and Jesus quite easy to enter brother you came from the same order of creation the is order if you don't think like this peoples will always harass you let me give you a short testimony I just came from multiple altars from oh but a James have you come to his meetings but as James wants trouble at my Titus you know appetite as yet no cure so I call him friend in America bro can you help with the drugs he said bloody dogs expensive I say Jimmy should go to belief because I've 20 to believe that you can live above appetizers so he came to the whole meetings god blessed us with an anointing when back I said would you please go back home test your feet one when we do the test it test there was not one simple that's a god I saw that God I'm talking about I've seen this God walk so my aspirations is to be the real son of God an adopted son also research hallelujah so I have all faith that God is not dead that God is alive and that God is your God that God is my card within it here we see that Bridget visit bra Morris's question is wonderful it brings the sinner convicting which is teaching place is your position on me Vamsi you cannot lightly have fear if you don't know who you are positioned on so when a man rose in the movie is positionally is a question reward because the newest position where are you now because the things you take from the table this is 2017 I want to come to a meeting we are people who say devil you can do this to me maybe you missed me mum says you can hardly have say for divine healer hardly have faith that is what I breathe in me to us where we chose to do the sovereign walk do our own thing do things our own with having to use the mind what you think what you feel how you see serve I'll not God's Way just away that's with white women but that's we has a dead end but there's a way that leaves or to life [Applause] so I don't talk about the way that seemeth right that looks white while he's away underwear looks all right but the end all that way is bad everything [Music] thank you Jim you see that I wish you see Adam claw get the seed he wasn't a witness in creation but it was to be given this seed by which all things are created and God did that Abraham as a promise or down through the ages keep movin on movin on movin on please God hallelujah play brother said it was an uncle in dream it was a composition we are God can give him this region a seed by which all things did and that seed us to be Christ the fullness of the world if you see I witness an image that is one big no k2 that they filled in on belief go to pack the seed because that's it can go to the enemy because if Satan gets all of that see what he can do with it got to get back and a captain to the Seventh Seal to regional sea from says the spoken word you can't have real spoken word outside the sea in this age does a promise before the rapture somebody will pick up that seed it trust will cast a seed a minister will have that fear also buddies on hallelujah hallelujah the authority that's what we're conservator of a holy convocation is going back to all things we have done on the force be God had an economy that was wrong by Spoken work towards course economy every being God feed was my world what he called that walk if you call it polymer what we do now is we toy with a walk we walk you speak that the sons of God operate this big regatta tutorial and somebody shout hallelujah somebody's your turn a lawyer let me see this [Applause] Adam tell them to toiling become the toil sweet or to the stretch of they face when I was not ghost regional equation that was never got thought towards Adam Adam field in this commission but God promised I'll restore I'll bring it back because my purpose to be defeated I'll find some sons and daughters who

spirit and we had not taken count on the school the poor human spirit that was sitters plan see God made man in his own image his own intention to also get a man in the image of a beast you see but thank you over all these mysteries about the image of the beast told you through that beasties do you think that beast will have to be some some little personal some some some animal that was four feet are the feet of a beer now if you have wisdom counts the number of the beast it is the number of a man just what the beacon is a deed he builds the image of a man it was worship and the angel told the ad Daniel with it the beacon as how the how this will be like four kingdoms but it shows a human government the human spirit the rule the whole world and the devil has worked so hard on the human spirit is brought it way up to 70 43 having a form of godliness for a still human that's no God their concern is ever but what Daniels former typically thus was gone come from heaven and smashed that image because that was not God's original image that way in this is I'm so mindful of the humans do it so in the cyber corners you must die to yourself Noblet history recent visit that's why we've been warned all these years of a second chemo to throw in spirit it's a spirit that is a form of godliness but be nice the power lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God he men now who do you

indeed can be so they that's pocket of flesh if he calls her flesh a mind because it's a mind the Confessor flesh where's the kernel mind is a spirit and Paul explains why he thinks what a dog he cannot do I said you know why because Eve and Paul cores are the man of safe [Music] this is the devil took his time to walk on there man like God worked on his image his walked on them and has made them answer all religious is even a longer what is force it's really human there's no seed in there to deceive you never see that that practice message to me as impacted my life and you can't come into this message I'm pretty sure you are beyond accepted already because many of us have been deceived by our human spirit is it listen it is the devil like the human spirit because if the spigot is of the highest grade it has good in it it does even in it and and that will control your senses nothing wrong with your reasoning and affection who is the nature of the reasoning of the memory the nature conservancy advantage if the nectar of your reasoning and your memory is evil runs over somebody walking all day in your mind all you can be memorized is what you saw on pornography how you see

here's a sinless character the character cannot seen and prevail your character cannot seen yeah you see you see you see you are living a strong tonight we will always be tempted like with all service morning Gaza foliage new good and evil when man sinned God said man as become as one of us in knowing that was monthly be patient man loss is knowledge of life can became like go to that order in almost Gordon good and evil but you see it can't handle it I tell folks back home young people you tend to yourself you go check you go to the Facebook buy those phones and what's these and what can you handle it all those things you want you can you handle them can you wash money a Christian I doubt that you may know 50 B if you form your loops are all change because if you're happy to see one man that you admire you can't even handle them you can't even handle your friend who goes to school and twist like a rag a movie you make him five times in school now you become you like him we're talking about well I see the same people every day I even have friends whose it and Montano stuff but I can't become them no no no I can't become them they know made I'm a Christian I'm a child of God oh sorry Louie hallelujah I can't become them I can handle them I can contend in I can't tell them it's a devil's village that cannot change me at all I can handle everything it is it many things you expose yourself to you can't handle it many friends you dunk up yourself with you can't handle those wings they are too powerful for you because no idea weakness and we support only becomes an enticement to you see what God has character he knows God he knows evil he knows all the bad things we do he knows how the business will make but his character for be king whom thinking his mind won't you you are here tonight I don't care what you're gone but they still baptize you with the Holy Ghost that discussed Kuwata what you did this morning does it change gossipy neon what you did tonight with no change docile video you are predestinated under settled it so I don't care if you came to this meeting as a fornicator before you leave go tell baptize you with the Holy Ghost God and propels you with fire hallelujah God character can handle good and evil what God knows doesn't change him we don't have that ability is anomic I fell for Sookie what if God gives me a gift to come behind his puppet in suitable scenes to see who is in charge right now who just committed on some stuff can I handle F or will I go and call the pastor's in the pew come you know what role I just committed adultery it many of us do that we are friends because everything goes good and well what if something goes wrong can we undo that gambit with the friendship in the midst of what went wrong you see that text corrected that is gospel Eto'o somebody shout hallelujah that is acting by nature that would all said go save the rain or the trust and you're just we just had our one minute I see wiping out under the minister that's a quarter problem so it shows where God country was killed to see into people's lives what the plan will not do that he had such a great to see it so people's bad life but the angel what him was there confess don't say tau run say sometimes you Hawk friends wrong people that the Holy Ghost told us tells you this mother you're jogging has just stopped you behind your back but you have to argue with me difference from so I can't even tell the difference between my friends and my enemies that's character odd I haven't seen it was a quarter character there knows good and evil because in this is a catchy we deliver you if I don't know what so weak spots are what can I handle and God let me see you come you spirit on you can I feel handily and pray for you I will cut you off and said you have a raw spirit that one has a raw spirit that part two has a rock to it [Music] that's a colorful issue I wish it never seen it never see can we handle it it will also see who knows what what's your weak spots are you came here tonight with such weak spot you intimate eyes but can you handle them with all that can you see same a child of God God has a purpose for me the righteous man bullets several times but you rise it up again thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah how do we handle that and that is really a claim to rock here from forgiveness because God has a proper to justify the seed when he said you've been to to the first place he wasn't talking to your human spirit that's the messed up section but you have another section another life and God is going to transfer you to a transfer your mentality but one for your ideology from this section to this intersection [Applause] the seed him you have been justified that's it cannot seen that scene never seen before there is nothing against that scene [Applause] forgiveness has a beginning and it has an end when God brings an end to see me brings an angel forgiveness so this convocation it's not to call you to stay and forgiveness does Church but we are causing all that to a justify state by a sea not just something you imagine by a scene now inside my soul and the Holy Ghost comes tonight to look for that sea so I am NOT in this message to have my human spirit mainly cleaned up but I'm here to become a new man the new man is in the scriptures Paul talks of you all man and it talks of a new me you can deny that there is an old man who is corrupt after his own sinful deeds well as a new man that is created in holiness and righteousness and that new man comes out of your scene that new man cannot seen [Applause] never see this never see that busy day we hit it let me just with your code quickly please vamos ask a question on translation faith what is translation free she understood it means drug translation mum says the question is please explain the mystery of the transi of the bride how will the bradley translator because who does give you faith for Greek translation faith what is that translation she understand you from church just people we inhabit the earth Brite lives in the city one of the seven angels called John let me show you the bride the Lambs wife what did John see a city it is your bride that means the bride has become a city but the angel said are mushy lumps wife the bride hey John so holy city coming down from heaven the Malachi 4 tied back to pray to that City and we got future hope now you are that's not Church you can't live in that city with human spirit you live there with your valleys we have been taught this through the message you have to believe them and not fables the accuses of all hi to God the bumps is just a change of our bodies now let's say you you know what I mean when I say that I don't mean to be sacrilegious I don't mean to sit hours I don't mean to say this church I'm a to see every believer Abraham II was looking for a promise to son that was promised him did I write and the church is looking for promise on the bride is the bride is looking for the promise on before the promised son can come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed if they're like she was too old to have a baby she had no big veins in a breast a breast was dried out her womb was entitled was sterile she could not have the baby her hat was too old Suzanne labor so what happened God changed her back to a young woman and it did Abraham the same thing cuz the said his body was as good as dead and he had to change their body in order to receive the promised son we cannot receive the promise on that promise us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are seen the first conscience controls this body which see it is feel smell here is just goddess or scope Allah be wheezing and everything else but that new body that comes from this born again not this first conscience it will pass away is that inside something at least able to understand that same n it's not this coughs I'd cities from smelling here it is it it's subject to death and we die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die is another person that the new life strong from this new valve listen and it deals and not a person in the image of this person you are around that life the mystery that means if you ever see that because you can be born again without the scene because you see you can be reborn after you're born again you have a life but around that life will come another posing in the image that means you look like you but it would really be you I am NOT a person in the image you have to believe there man so it is the person that goes the rupture that is where we preach the funny of the world image another person in the image of with mercy that you are around that life Oh somebody shout hallelujah he was revealing twice less on faith there was a question and Sabbath on the give you faith for peace that means when you come into your season lord have mercy lord have mercy another man shall be side of you I'll step behind the pulpit you will pick it with a John with the same looks while you Norma the old man I am NOT a new man what did the same image of this person that I am like for the pranam he was God bail God empathy God taking upon who William an upper back or president hallelujah so when he stands here it was not for the better it was God he the Prophet God a mas God changed his king and God is about to take your scheme [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah Pentecostals don't know this see so tots people they're gonna charge to get me a humans please clean up but what bother bother broke in the court on future hall when God says is five ounces it is going to patch up it speaks of a brand-new puzzle because you need a brand-new main to be on that day because that every day is a new creation it's a brand-new day so we can get there with this old man who this always and it's all B's seven thought I give you faith [Applause] when I found this but my heart was blessed and receive it that is why these are the stages these are the stages you have to understand these you most other revelation that you will seed of God now say this outside man five senses does control by reasoning human spirit is a diamond once we only gets crop up with our mind will you our bride when Paul says the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly God subjected you to vanity to corruption one cause of the bondage of corruption but awesome said when I come evolve so please new man that is wrapped up in corruption it's great to come as one day I'll be a free man I'll be a new man a check mark about yourself [Applause] that must be our except researchers and the couple will okay this is a method of teaching applies demand in the mind is going to be in that eternal church age RAM thought you ordered manis it must be a man of seven spirit from Illinois it can't be human beings is a man with seven spirit the friend of Jesus Christ these are God's building materials that finished up man among course it's a beam where this beam is completed that's the mallet coin into th the eternal judge eggs never see this these are your mysteries if this makes twins are taking over your mind you would even have tempted to sin isn't it I mean I mean beautifully imagine walking around and knowing that won't be a man AG one in the flesh penalty will be a new man you go to your school and watch all your friends they are all all cactuses you understand how one they should become under the name if the spot and go to your mind we don't even have space to see this was enough mentality in a quote with God with his mechanics and what is mechanics was strange the dynamics and it was it found God took him please God my faith this should be our mindset for precision brother hallelujah hallelujah the forming of the morning meet another man in the image of this poster you are around that line you see that there is it bumps is so potentially it in here and what is it the world promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflect the negative that will reflect the positive the void and the same thing or the translation of the bride will be the same thing the world is in you the body will materialize around our world the city painted by Sarah how can you believe this if you believe me there's a man don't

Paris yeah my spirit was wounded I was crouched because I felt embarrassed but distal to me in front of my wife however one so you know I lived with it for years I try to do the normal thing as a Christian because say fine board attendees the hot was there it didn't coach but you know when I came to home after they anoint here I just felt something left me see so I went to him I said bro all the schools have been doing same coming back to say this is OK the truth was I will just will be a Christian but in my heart because there can be food without difference because if a giveness must go with fire all this sacrifice is a sacrifice to forgive somebody was watching is a sacrifice but it must go in fire when fire goes we bake the pie opposed to heart that is what we don't have all these years we plan to make sacrifice I forgive you but I don't fire there the hot still remains and the hot conditions your behavior how you do things but when the sacrifice is made by fire you for killing

praise God and those of us with a path that's not the end you receive the path with your steady started you are just in your millinium and the only goes itself as a partnership that will get because we are caught to be formed into the world image the passing consumerism is larger we come the Holy Ghost as apposite that's your promise not just about what a you only go thumb Denis you [Music] because does the man that God can entrust with spoken word after the God sees that's what amazement in you you can ask what you will so it has to be him in you if my words abide in you that's born is the passing in the church deposit in your flesh now the money gives the spoken word because that man will acts according to character so all this guy's been around Madhab head they're looking for me when God add up to this edge it gives you back the original scene that's what's real and it shall be done can somebody say hallelujah can somebody say hallelujah I just pushed my inspiration I praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah robideaux's an is everything then she repeat here right we do in a preparations now what we can do add as much as we can add my mental faith Mangel faith the way your mind tell is your means of free to believe goes what mentally but you mentally knowledge mentally all mental mental faith but you are adding mental Greta forgive you both are mentally when you contribute to your force seven boys is Vonda read holy convocation fella comes on it and turns your mental intellectual virtues your real character then faith becomes real vets becomes real they are passing to you completely you feel that you you feel knowledge it controls your emotions so all yourself is one because all these vectors they are only motion but yet they are the motions of the Holy Spirit rather than you feel in a hot UV peace don't even feel the hot you don't even know somebody hot you it's a reality not something you patch up you try to make like I have forgiven you but you still feel hot [Applause] but when forgiveness is bad thank you Jesus you feel that kindness then those batteries become a reality not something you imagine ramsey is not an imaginary thing you don't imagine vain you don't imagine that you feel that you left Jesus Jesus neither I feel that was never made so he knew by our feeling that strengthes like can somebody say miss Virgie can somebody say hallelujah this is your roadmap and take this off as you go now we are under the emotions of scene because it's not intellectual our face I will get you is all it election because what you said you have and what you feel is different many of us have not even experienced kp8 now it feels like I'm see the feel of faith how that you feels like how it feels like to forgive that cannot release [Music] lord have mercy please God thank you Jesus there's a reality to week and that's where I'm heading to this tonight and this is an edit to reality will face [Applause] Jesus question shall become the center of my motion you can't even move what you feel late to move your feel is become divine divinely late they finally got war can somebody shout hallelujah somebody shot when a lawyer you are such a blessed group to be in these meetings to understand about your culture understand who you are there is it and you see we have looked at the spoon the emotions of faith gets you forgive they would understanding so we are deceived to think we are forgiven when the realest is now there look I don't care if you say I forgive you if you still feel the heart it has no left you have not been forgiven yet and that is why our behaviors we say I forgive for nothing any changes we still have the broader with you say wrong things because the truth is we still feel the heart it's not gone yet if you dare what when we forgiveness comes it takes that emotion away I forgive you and then principle on the hell of you a cheap wine it flows out or somebody shout hallelujah and you see in that state you're not even asking for repentance you're not asking for a payback not somebody will be saying well I'll forgive him but exactly repent you can control their repentance itself is a date God must give that you're on what is for these and not on some strings I can only forgive him if he comes and says sorry you talk like that because you still hot [Music] can somebody say mr. jobs but when that feeling comes only my brother you don't even clear instead you are playing you are seeking how to have that brother love comes in your heart it becomes a reality you find ways or to pull him out and not setting standards that can't be made except a those bees except she does that suppose it cannot do that but how can you go to help him to bring him out but I love you - I child of God you cannot do that my pretense but it elect with something can somebody shout hallelujah so I understand when these virtues are all mental they are mental we don't know how to feel like and then you first take the mental to think that what it is like our super espresso powerful messages that I can't even leave it's all up here it's all mental a mental conception a mental idea with no experience so we have to switch over before you leave this thing's consumer research hallelujah God can be to give you spiritual free spirit ETSU spiritual knowledge and experience [Applause] [Applause] this is what we call intellectual faith that's a human spirit that reasons it imagines it and that man has got to die and it takes fire to kill the man it actually goes to kill their man maybe see this so what happened to me in ho but Allah kindness was bad into me for that situation maybe more tests are coming but God let me know about that me for that situation that the vaquita brother Cheney only I have to be realistic obviously I have to be honest to say for all this while I will say I forgive you but in my heart I was still hot I many of us don't go past that level we just stay on the pretenses whatever give you does okay because in your mind your mind tells should Apple forgiveness and the heart resides when bondage thank you Jesus Christ what God has put it to a holy convocation an appointment with God these young people know you have it you believe this message but it is what wish dusty what of the world lordy speaker it's a mental thing like metastatic that matter Christ was mental they cannot see faith what 52 thank you the strength everybody feels his plane when strength comes only you know he comes only he had to go to the upper room on that confession that was a true confession they will only spoke this morning that Christ is the high priest of our confession and God give us a true confession on the d70 true confession for the seven series of who you are you're not a chicken you are not a sinner right side of God why scared of God you are not a slave to fear or to bondage thank you Jesus that becomes a confession where am I going this way that God can accompany your faith and experience this thing should believe becomes reality when a man gets the Holy Ghost baptism II you want after water made manifest but you enter into the reality of it the war becomes real you feel it because there are feelings our reality I don't care what you say we are made that way you are the fruit of the Spirit is love is all with peace but they are all emotional but these are the emotions of the Holy Spirit and that was out the old prophets we are led when do we let matters do it comes it just one north from God they will know they must that the feelings of the spirit and somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah the feelings of the Spirit not the Holy Ghost and the only go stop with all your evil nature because I delphos back on anger is a spirit but how do you know anger and oscillate you you know how anger feels how joy is a spirit but it has a later you know how joy feels fornication is a speed but it has a major because you know how it feels when the feeling comes on you it confused the nature of the Spirit but is what drives you to the action versus motions of scenes with their will emotions and many of us we understand by emotions what we understand the Holy Spirit we allow our emotions to tell us this little people Joe because don't you feel bad about me so I am a bad person because your emotions I've give you a feeling or what you call bad labra the Madam's I said then then you make me a pulled out of your feelings of your opinions but that's not wholly goes these are feelings messed up with good and evil so how do you even trust those feelings but if the Holy Ghost is there when Brown meets Krishna so the prayer line branches I think a welcome spirit that's how we lose very Christian once amix you the Holy Ghost Ellison he feels welcome this is very crystal with the Holy Ghost man says yes I feel it can somebody say Messner and these are people you meet for the first time thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus so when these are feelings we are so messed up food is good at a blue pail and we are cess people by how we feel about them that's human spirit so go toward you love your enemy anywhere you feel bad to pray for him because when the Holy Ghost comes upon you the might be a disabled that's what I love the land of the Holy Spirit or somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah thank you Jesus the land of the Spirit and that has to die I've met plenty of people they don't even know who I am their feelings tell them Who I am and down the road you realize that we are just victims of lies from the human spirit because sure humans which does not know me because I was way back before the world began and in that stage your human spirit was not there can somebody say Amen all these revelations are put into you your human spirit and they're just to get a reasoning you do yourself more harm there is another spirit in you that Allah seed that was where back there and the spirit is a believer now listen listen I am in East Wing listen when the Holy Ghost comes you start to pray you will know tonight if God is going to heal you woman said she felt within ourselves you might come to me tisha might be maybe in this meeting it will not happen if I happen to a because many many places but faith is like the Holy Ghost when you go back to the Holy Ghost you know it something comes on you you know this has never happened to me have a feel of settlement a feeling of satisfaction guarantee it stabilizes you [Applause] no more in and out of the church in your mind you might not understand but using your heart a feel of settlement a feel of satisfaction and we all know where we feel satisfied [Applause] that means when the Holy Ghost picks about the media's right now there is some the Holy Ghost will give you a witness let me give you a few place but all of us there was in Congo I just made his finish ministry and there was a pastor Sonya damn beaten Phyllis preach the Bible power light when could weapon work so I was called about the country do we meet it is bogus back to you equal to work but the anointing was present lamb but Along Came Outsiders put for him the unknown key was a president you're seldom up like this say standoff how do you feel before the boy stood up is felt strength came into him you may be sick season here tonight with issues and the Holy Ghost is coming I'm gonna separate you from your reasoning you feel hot you feel sick you flip race there's a whole eco still incoming a whole time or always do it when that comes on you respond [Applause] don't sit back in your imagination press pause and say I am he I'm believer that time it was I've been on this business for a while was it it let me see it Elijah just had to see a cloud as small as a man's and then his book go tell air I hear the sound of abundance of way just a little chill comes on you Frances out and wallah I am here Kabam sake if you don't do that it slips off and the hot waves of hell comes in you must must be taught how to receive the things of the Spirit things of the speaker doesn't come like it comes physical it comes as an anointing now demons I hear in me tonight and they are going to pass out because an authority is coming to the building but I'm teaching you how to get free because tonight is a prayer life what we for the fireline God can give you a witness God can give you a debate witness don't go we play imagination [Music] let me see there those of you seeking the Holy Baptism how does it come ambition teaches woman on the Holy Ghost many people sometimes complete all the services of a little receive the holy good of the Holy Ghost they don't even know what it is you must first what the Holy Ghost is what it is given for and what it will do some sex is a prerequisite before you even ask for it so in short I ask only ghosts feel people worth to give a testimony how did you receive the Holy Ghost how did you know it was the Holy Ghost we all don't have to receive it the same way but when it comes you know as a revelation given to you it's a Staunton to you and as you go down in your life the only goes activate itself you see things happening to you that was not happening with you before to confirm you experience that means what I'm saying tonight the only ghost can come up on you I'm telling you before the service leaves you might feel the same way but once is there by tomorrow next tomorrow the things are shedding off the things are dying out because not only ghosts cannot fly [Applause] somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah Canoga whatever you need me for the prayer line somebody in here over here now all those would add cases put your hands up those are

about his love for us and we are responding to his love for us amen so we really thank the Lord for making it possible when against all odds the enemy fought at every hand but this meeting as were the context at tonight was a divine appointment there is no accident in God there is no mistake in guarding everything is in perfect order and harmony because he has been Roberto said there are no books there are no surprises who was at this meeting God wanted at this meeting and whenever God comes down and his people come together something has to happen and as many of the ministers spoken it has been echoed many times we will leave this meeting and you will not leave empty this word will follow you this word and the anointing of the Holy Spirit will follow the seed in your soul because you didn't put the seed there the devil didn't put it there it ever can touch it you can't even touch it that sea is your identity from before there was a moon and before there was a star and a couple weeks ago I told the church you know we acknowledge God is omnipotent we acknowledge he's all-powerful but they are certain limitations to God they certain things that God cannot do he cannot lie he cannot make a mistake and when he speaks the work and sing us it as glut has come to pass and I believe in my heart every word that was spoken in this meeting is going to come to pass the arrow has already left the bowl it's on its way your family coming back is on its way the Holy Ghost that you have been desperate for is on its way your healing is on its way your deliverance is on its way your revival is going to follow you in your school on your job in your home amen you may be seated so how many appreciated ministers that spoke this meaning with a Peter Chandler thank you for coming to
