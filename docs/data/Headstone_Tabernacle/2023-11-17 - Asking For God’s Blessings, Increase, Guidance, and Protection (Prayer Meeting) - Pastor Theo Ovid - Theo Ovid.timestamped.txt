[14:53] have something upon my heart I'd like to
[14:55] share with you and the title give the
[14:58] title first asking for God's
[15:00] blessings
[15:02] increase guidance and protection that's
[15:06] the title of what I want to share with
[15:07] you tonight to get in prayer asking for
[15:10] God's
[15:11] blessings
[15:12] increase guidance and protection and we
[15:16] want to take a text from 1 Chronicles
[15:18] chapter
[15:20] 4 and uh we want to read from verse 7
[15:24] from verse 1 to 6 is uh you know who
[15:28] begot who and like that so I will skip
[15:31] from one you can always read it and um
[15:34] it looks almost I wouldn't say
[15:37] boring but it looks like there's nothing
[15:39] in it in terms of just names the sons of
[15:42] Judah farz hezron Ki her that's in verse
[15:45] one and it goes on and on and on now in
[15:48] verse 7 it says this is 1 Chronicles
[15:51] chapter 4 verse 7 and the sons of hiler
[15:55] were zerth and jar and ethnan and cause
[16:01] begat
[16:02] anob zobah and the families of ahel the
[16:06] son of Haram and all of a
[16:10] sudden this uh name calling and name
[16:14] description of who beg got who and so
[16:16] like that is interrupted by this verse
[16:19] here verse 9 and
[16:22] jabz was more honorable than his
[16:26] Brethren and his mother called his name
[16:29] jabz
[16:30] saying because I bear him with
[16:35] sorrow and jabz called on the god of
[16:39] Israel saying oh that thou wouldest
[16:44] bless me
[16:45] indeed and enlarge my coast and that
[16:49] thine hand might be with me and that
[16:53] thou wouldest Keep Me From
[16:56] Evil that it may not grieve
[17:00] me and God granted
[17:04] him that which he
[17:07] requested oh blessed be the name of the
[17:10] Lord God granted him that what he
[17:14] requested and I take a little
[17:17] peek in the
[17:19] Amplified
[17:22] and I'll read verse 10 says jabes cried
[17:25] to the god of Israel saying oh that you
[17:28] would bless me and enlarge my border
[17:31] that your hand might be with me and you
[17:34] would keep me from Evil so it might not
[17:36] hurt me and God granted his request this
[17:38] is our text tonight and this is very
[17:42] interesting and you know when the Bible
[17:45] calls out a name it is of some
[17:48] significance and Jab ja's life prayer
[17:52] and requests were noteworthy and
[17:55] important enough to be written in the
[17:58] Bible
[18:00] now jabz was born when his when he was
[18:04] born the Bible talk about his mother
[18:06] called his name
[18:08] jabz
[18:10] because she bore him in
[18:13] pain so that is a terrible thing I think
[18:16] to name the child and that name carry
[18:20] sorrow and sorrowful and so on but that
[18:22] is the name that she give her son note
[18:27] jabel
[18:28] was more honorable than his brothers now
[18:32] that name jabz in the Hebrew is a word
[18:34] for pain and sorrow and we know and I
[18:39] didn't put it down here but talk about
[18:41] that church is groaning that the Holy
[18:43] Ghost is just as real and just before
[18:45] that he was talking about how the
[18:46] Hebrews mother when they given birth
[18:49] they will be in labor pains and the
[18:52] church have to get into labor pains
[18:56] there are people that are light they
[18:58] just come and go back home no burden no
[19:01] concern but the storms a hit yet so they
[19:07] could afford to you know take it easy
[19:10] but it coming
[19:12] coming
[19:16] so jabz asked God to bless him bless me
[19:20] and I want you to see
[19:22] tonight it is
[19:24] not a hard thing to ask God to bless
[19:27] it's not a terrible thing to bless you
[19:30] to bless you because I want you to pray
[19:32] pray this prayer I want you to to look
[19:34] closer at this prayer tonight and God
[19:37] granted him requests so I have some
[19:40] things that I highlighted here and the
[19:43] Bible speaks about let us therefore this
[19:46] is Hebrews 4:16 let us therefore come
[19:49] boldly before the throne of grace that
[19:51] we may obtain mercy and find Grace to
[19:55] help in a time of need now
[19:58] it is not easy having a name like
[20:01] jabz it is not easy to be packing a
[20:04] Sorrow by your name by your birth by
[20:07] your
[20:08] environment it's it's a hard thing jabz
[20:12] was born out of sorrow and pain and jabz
[20:16] had Brothers note the Bible never
[20:19] mentioned not one of his brothers that
[20:23] means he was living a life Above the
[20:26] Rest whether he was the middle child
[20:28] first child second child I don't know
[20:30] where he fit into this brother's line
[20:33] but you always find that the elect or
[20:36] the named or you know they say the cream
[20:39] just come to the top regardless of what
[20:42] and pressures and people claim you know
[20:45] my mother my father they have excuses as
[20:47] to why they are how they are and I
[20:50] reject that because the Bible give us a
[20:53] clear line if you want a breakthrough or
[20:56] if you want Deliverance they are so much
[20:58] people relish and they seem to be almost
[21:01] enjoy going back in the past and who do
[21:04] them and what they go through and nobody
[21:06] and know all kind of I call it nonsense
[21:08] because this guy was born to his mother
[21:13] had pain and she named him after that
[21:17] now the Bible talk about jabz was more
[21:19] honorable than his brothers and the
[21:22] Bible the term honorable is used to
[21:24] describe individuals who were esteemed
[21:26] respected have qualities that are worthy
[21:29] of admiration it signifies a person of
[21:33] character conduct
[21:36] reputation what kind of person are you
[21:39] I'm not talking about your your Pew I'm
[21:42] not talking about your chair seat I'm
[21:43] not talking about you're in church or
[21:45] you're in this message I'm not talking
[21:46] about that I'm talking about being
[21:48] honorable the word honorable is a word
[21:52] called Cabo I think is in the Hebrew and
[21:54] it signifies when applied to individual
[21:58] it suggests that they possess qualities
[22:01] that bring honor dignity or respect to
[22:05] themselves and
[22:08] others honorable also goes with
[22:10] character it refers to individuals who
[22:13] exhibit moral Integrity righteousness
[22:16] uprightness uprightness in their
[22:18] thoughts words and action honorable also
[22:23] go with deeds and action it can describe
[22:25] acts of kindness generosity
[22:28] righteousness that are praiseworthy and
[22:30] commendable like Romans 12:17 says
[22:32] recompense no man even for evil provide
[22:35] things honest in the sight of all men
[22:37] and he Amplified it says repay no one
[22:40] evil for evil but take thought for what
[22:43] is honest and proper and Noble aiming to
[22:47] be above reproach in the sight of
[22:50] everyone praise the Lord also an
[22:53] honorable person according to biblical
[22:56] the Bible seeks to live in a manner that
[22:58] it brings glory and honor to God and
[23:02] benefit others honorable has nothing to
[23:05] do with selfishness and I and me and I
[23:07] first honor have nothing to do with that
[23:10] at all and Jesus in Luke 815 speaking
[23:15] about the good ground he say but they
[23:17] that are on good ground are the which is
[23:20] an in an honest and good heart having
[23:23] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[23:26] fruit with patience
[23:28] so jabz went and prayed to God that you
[23:33] would bless me you would bless me not
[23:36] the job not the salary not the pay some
[23:39] people think the pay blessing them you
[23:41] know because the money that they getting
[23:43] mean so much to them they could throw
[23:45] off God they could throw out the channel
[23:47] of God the word of God and they powering
[23:49] themselves because of what is behind
[23:51] them now but jabz knew that his source
[23:57] of blessing was from God he wasn't going
[23:59] to a man he was going to God and he ask
[24:04] for increase of his cost or enlarge my
[24:07] territory I find that is bold that is
[24:10] Dearing there are some people they
[24:12] contented with what they have but this
[24:14] man jabz you could see he had ambition
[24:17] he have desire he want to increase he
[24:20] want to expand and this expansion is not
[24:24] just I believe physical but I so I
[24:26] believe it's spiritual I think that each
[24:28] one of us here tonight should want an
[24:30] increase you want an expansion not just
[24:33] a physical or what not you want an
[24:35] expansion in your health in your
[24:36] strength in your finances in your
[24:38] blessing in your Communication in your
[24:40] winning Souls you want to expand enlarge
[24:44] my territory and he went on to say that
[24:46] your hand be with me that your hand be
[24:50] upon me and how did he say it here he
[24:52] says that thou would bless me indeed
[24:55] enlarge my coast and that thy hand might
[24:58] be with me and th Keep Me From Evil so
[25:01] watch I believe that jabz was a humble
[25:05] Soul because you see humility make you
[25:07] bow humility makees you dependent
[25:10] humility confess that you don't know you
[25:12] people who are so arrogant they fet to
[25:14] know everything okay they you can't tell
[25:16] them anything you can't bring counsel or
[25:18] guidance they just know and you have to
[25:20] leave them alone until what we call you
[25:23] bounce your head hit a wall and that and
[25:26] crash but javz he was humble enough to
[25:32] Bow before God and to sayl I want you to
[25:37] bless me I want you to enlarge my
[25:41] territory I want your hand to be upon me
[25:44] and it was showing that jabz was asking
[25:48] for guidance and it troubled us so much
[25:52] at times that we see people make
[25:54] decisions make choices they do things
[25:57] without
[25:58] guidance no guidance they don't even
[26:01] understand the role of the pastor as a
[26:04] guide because the pastor will get
[26:06] inspiration from God to bring leadership
[26:09] to bring guidance to bring a word and so
[26:12] like that they do their own thing but
[26:13] they just going to church they come like
[26:15] if them you know like them and God in
[26:18] that sense but you see it still doesn't
[26:20] work that way God use people and God
[26:22] want to bring correct guidance to you
[26:25] this here is a defining thing for me he
[26:30] had Faith despite of his name and he
[26:35] didn't allow his name of Sorrow to
[26:38] Define him he was going against the
[26:40] Green he was going against all ODS and
[26:44] when things are not going well for you
[26:46] you have to be able to go against the
[26:48] grain and go on go against all Earths he
[26:51] knew the power of calling upon God Lord
[26:56] bless me and brother Bram speak about
[26:59] this in Inspiration he says when Jordan
[27:03] when Elisha crossed Jordan and he turned
[27:05] to him and said what would you have me
[27:08] to do for you Elisha said that a double
[27:11] portion of your spirit be upon you he
[27:13] said you ask a great thing then the
[27:16] prophet said this God wants us to ask
[27:20] for big
[27:22] things my God he don't run out of
[27:24] blessings up to you you can't ask too
[27:27] much good Lord s look at right here you
[27:30] can't ask for too much could you imagine
[27:34] a little fish about that long out in the
[27:37] middle of the ocean saying I better not
[27:39] drink much of this water because it
[27:41] might go dry but that's just
[27:42] unreasonable as would be or more so
[27:45] unreasonable to think that God's
[27:47] blessing would be exhausted to the
[27:49] believer all Heavens belonged to you
[27:53] that's a direct quote ask for big thing
[27:56] start to tonight tonight we don't want
[27:59] you to leave it for the next per meeting
[28:01] I want you to start this on a plan this
[28:03] tonight this guy Jaz asked God to
[28:07] increase his Coast to expand his
[28:11] territory and to ask God for that means
[28:15] you know this remind me of for know in
[28:19] literature sometimes you're doing
[28:21] Shakespeare and whatnot and they have
[28:23] one line and they expect you to write a
[28:25] whole essay on this one line and there
[28:27] so much dep inside there and this word
[28:29] so much depth inside the there this
[28:31] thing expansion of territory if increase
[28:35] my territory that doesn't mean God just
[28:38] taking land and expand it what he's
[28:40] asking God give me victory over the
[28:43] enemy because those days territory mean
[28:45] you a fighting so you you can't want God
[28:50] to increase your territory and you not
[28:52] prepared to fight so if your prayer is
[28:55] tonight leave me as I am right here
[28:58] I am
[28:59] comfortable you I'm getting by you what
[29:02] you really saying I don't want to fight
[29:04] I don't want to press I'm comfortable in
[29:07] my one by one or 2x4 or whatever it is
[29:10] you you are sick you you are ill you you
[29:13] are problems you you not you're not
[29:15] seeing what God want to see because you
[29:16] see God told Joshua from this part to
[29:20] the going of the sun sh your Coast when
[29:22] you're walking and see sun going down
[29:24] and he go all of that you keep walking
[29:26] then sh your coast and there shall no
[29:28] man be able to stand before thee all the
[29:30] days of my life all days of your life so
[29:32] so when when jabz was asking about
[29:35] increase that is why I title
[29:39] title Noti i title
[29:42] it asking for God's
[29:45] blessings
[29:47] increase guidance and protection almost
[29:50] done wouldn't beong with you tonight so
[29:53] when he asked for increase expansion of
[29:55] territory increase increase in
[29:58] possession even Prosperity a life marked
[30:03] by increase it means he prepar for war
[30:07] he prepared to fight he prepared to
[30:09] overcome he's asking God for victory we
[30:11] know how it is in the Book of Joshua you
[30:13] have to be able to fight and overcome
[30:16] and then you could you remember in
[30:18] Joshua there was somebody a tribe come
[30:20] and complain how they land too smallart
[30:22] and Joshua rebuked them and say look oh
[30:24] look look look it have Hills go cut and
[30:26] fight you expand expand but you see the
[30:31] spirit of contentment and the spirit of
[30:34] laia and the spirit of laziness and that
[30:36] is why I cannot see virtue going to a
[30:40] lazy soul I a seen it adding anything
[30:42] because Joseph means God will add second
[30:47] Peter is God adding add not subtract add
[30:51] act to your faith virtue and knowledge
[30:52] and Temperance God want increase how
[30:55] many see that tonight
[30:58] God don't want you where you are am God
[31:00] want you where he wants you to be he
[31:02] wants that Spirit of Excellence to
[31:03] achieve God want his people to be the on
[31:06] on top not below to be the head not the
[31:09] tail he wants you to be like a candle
[31:12] placed on a hill you don't like a candle
[31:14] and put it under a Bush Hill you put it
[31:16] on top the hill and that's why it's so
[31:19] noteworthy that the Bible identify jabz
[31:23] as more honorable than his brothers so
[31:26] let's say his brothers in church let's
[31:28] say Brothers laal there Breen Sons but
[31:32] they pressing on to adoption they're not
[31:34] pressing on to Perfection they're not
[31:35] pressing on to Excellence they're not
[31:37] pressing on to a level that would give
[31:39] them that spack that God could take a
[31:42] note of them because this is what God
[31:44] did here now he took a note of jabz
[31:46] nobody has name is called nobody names
[31:49] is called he injected this guy called
[31:51] jabz and I think it's for us to take a
[31:54] little look and see this short prayer he
[31:57] ra and going over and over and set of
[31:59] repetition it's very simple very
[32:01] straightforward I want you to bless me I
[32:04] want you to increase me I want you to
[32:07] guide me and I want you to protect me oh
[32:10] Hallelujah and God answer his prayer oh
[32:12] I feel like shouting tonight I keep to
[32:15] behave myself tonight on this chair but
[32:17] but but but but this is this is this is
[32:19] what this is about so I want to shake
[32:21] you tonight and rock you tonight that
[32:24] you wouldn't just be comfortable now um
[32:27] all right so the next one he ask for
[32:28] God's hand to be upon him and that's
[32:31] that's what he looking for God's
[32:32] presence God's guidance and the last one
[32:35] he asks for is protection from Evil and
[32:39] I find this is very important because as
[32:42] Christians you know sometimes you know
[32:44] God blessing you and so on and you're
[32:46] not looking for evil you're not looking
[32:47] for when the enemy trying with traps and
[32:50] tricks and you have to be on a lookout
[32:52] because Jesus says in Matthew 6:13 and
[32:55] lead us not into temptation Jesus
[32:57] interjected it in how the Our Father
[33:00] prayer was was was capped and lead us
[33:03] not into temptation but Deliver Us from
[33:06] Evil for thine is the kingdom the power
[33:09] and the glory forever amen so this evil
[33:12] is something to take a note her don't
[33:14] just think everything that's going
[33:16] smooth and no no no there are forces of
[33:19] evil trying to get at you trying to get
[33:21] at your family trying to get at your
[33:23] home I was telling a pastor in miam I
[33:25] say sometimes Satan send people into the
[33:26] church
[33:27] Minister sometimes doesn't understand
[33:28] that the Fig another a member somebody
[33:31] come and another member but sometimes
[33:33] Lucifer sent them to bring all kind of
[33:35] erction and issues and all kind of stuff
[33:37] the spirit so so I think it's powerful
[33:41] that jab says protection from Evil all
[33:45] right but one I'm going to close here
[33:47] now I'm going to close here now one of
[33:50] the biggest thing that I saw here though
[33:54] is when he talk
[33:55] about that that was was keeping from
[33:57] Evil that it may not grieve me that it
[34:01] would not hurt me that it wouldn't be a
[34:03] sorrowful experience to me so he
[34:07] actually was able to identify his name
[34:12] and his environment in this prayer and
[34:14] say you know what I reject the destiny
[34:17] that my name speak I supposed to be in
[34:20] other words when that name drop on you
[34:22] you're supposed to be sorrowful you're
[34:23] supposed to be this you're supposed to
[34:25] be that and the you to be destined to
[34:28] that he said I don't want that he had a
[34:31] complete rejection I have this here
[34:33] written a complete rejection of the
[34:35] destiny by which his name defined by
[34:38] stating I that I don't bring pain that
[34:43] is what he I I I I I don't want to bring
[34:45] pain God was pleased and God answered
[34:49] his prayer and I am finished tonight you
[34:52] know sometime people put a word on you
[34:54] you will be this you'll be that you'll
[34:55] be that you fall and you think that you
[34:58] will remain Fallen that's not true you
[35:01] could go against the Green and I
[35:04] challenge you
[35:05] tonight God could bless you abundantly
[35:08] you know sometime you hear us preach
[35:10] David say my cup run it over that's a
[35:11] real
[35:12] thing that's a think about it now David
[35:15] had more than he could handle it's so
[35:18] much that he said my cup run it over
[35:23] don't be afraid to ask God for miracle
[35:26] don't be afraid to ask God for
[35:28] deliverance and breakthrough and a
[35:29] rescue from your selfishness your
[35:32] harshness your unot behavior your
[35:35] terrible Behavior they have terrible
[35:38] Christians they are Christians because
[35:40] they under Christ and they confess
[35:42] Christ but they terrible behav people
[35:44] and I said you have bad Sons back Sons
[35:47] half halfway sons all kind of sons but
[35:50] guess what there's going to be the right
[35:52] kind
[35:53] of I want you tonight to be like jabz I
[35:57] want you tonight to say Lord bless me
[36:01] you have to have a certain amount of
[36:02] boldness to come and say God bless me
[36:05] you know your life is already but you
[36:06] are going to ask God tonight to bless
[36:08] you you're going to ask God tonight to
[36:11] increase I don't care what you have if
[36:14] you have a million God could increase
[36:16] that if you have 10 million God could
[36:18] increase that because if God increase
[36:20] you is to bless others your increase is
[36:23] never to be selfish to say I have and I
[36:25] own and this is my
[36:27] your blessing is that it could run over
[36:30] and the the powerful thing about this
[36:32] increase is how you have to fight for it
[36:35] you asking God in other words jabz
[36:37] didn't look for a shortcut he didn't
[36:39] look for easy way out there are so many
[36:42] people looking for easy way out there is
[36:44] no shortcuts you have to possess this
[36:47] land you have to deal with the Hittites
[36:49] in your life
[36:50] jebusites G all the ice P the
[36:53] Philistines let us bow our heads tonight
[36:56] heaven hely father it was just trilling
[36:59] for me to study this and to look at this
[37:01] guy called jabz that the Bible
[37:04] highlighted in such a unique way in just
[37:06] two verses in just two verses of so much
[37:09] things and that could almost take like a
[37:11] Bible study and drilling down inside of
[37:15] dear oh this guy that was bted by Pain
[37:20] by his mother named sorrow named jabz
[37:24] named painful and he carrying this wait
[37:26] on him maybe never had a joyful time in
[37:29] his life and he choose to Humble himself
[37:33] go before God and say God bless me God
[37:38] increase me God let your hand be upon me
[37:43] and God protect me and the Bible said
[37:47] God answered his request may we be like
[37:51] that tonight Lord as we get on in prayer

[38:06] this word I believe it's something that
[38:08] God give us to share with you and I
