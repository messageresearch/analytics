Steven another very on Friday prayer meeting praise God a key these guys coming to some keys respond quickly bergenia not worth even they'll be a friend of God is there something else about Anthony

there is a possibility you can get that bridge here today do you believe that you've got to believe it you know amen praise God so we want to turn to Romans chapter 9. I want to read from verse 1 to 26. I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have with great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accused from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom put in the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the given of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers of a whom considering the flesh Christ came who is over all God bless forever amen not as though the word of God are taking non-effect but they are not all Israel which are Israel so you see Paul speaking with a burden here neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be scold specific that is which is at which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise accounted for the seed so you know who you are this morning A Child Of Promise the children of Promise of accounting for the seed for this is the word I promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children here we go be not yet born need to have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand none of works but of him that call it it was said unto the Elder Shall Serve the younger that is written Jacob have I loved Esau have I hate it what shall we see them is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said to Moses I'll have compassion and whom I have compassion so then it is not him that will it or him that run it but it's God that shortness he for the scripture said of pharaoh even unto the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared toward all the Earth therefore see on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he had net thou will say unto me why that he yet find fault for who had resisted his will man who are thou that are replies against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hat not the power the Potter power over the clay all the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another under dishonor what if God willing to show his right and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory unto the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory even us not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles for he said also say I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved I shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you're not my people they shall be called a children of the Living God Isaiah is also cry concern in Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the son of the sea a Remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth o praise the name of the Lord hallelujah let's borrow his father we thank you for your word we pray your blessing upon your people father as we approach your word now when Jesus we ask it amen you may be seated or praise be to Jesus again it's a blessing to be here it's good to have all of you out here this morning amen the presence of God we wouldn't always have these privileged friends there's a prophecy hanging over us that they're going to close us down they will have to because the Bible is being challenged now as an old-fashioned book now you don't have to live by that book but your Bible is our constitution that's the way we base our faith is upon the Bible is our constitution we cannot go against the constitution of of of the Bible it's not right every country a nation have a constitution and they live by that Constitution the judges the magistrates everybody live by that Constitution when we have a constitution that's the Bible praise and let every man's world be a lie and let God would be true so man could say one what they want by all this gender abundance foolishness God would declare what they want what everything is all praise the name of the Lord so this morning I have a title and the title is the question of why strange title but this is what I have for you this morning the question of why of a subject God's will perfect or permissive will God's will the question of why come why am I going through this why the fall why my situation why my husband why my wife why my children this question of why is a question that is deep inside of man children have that question why this why why because it's a desire to understand the causes the motivations the attitudes and behavior of people so why he could come under different areas they could come under calls and where you ask why did something happen what what factors led to this situation another wanted Commander motivation why did someone do something what is the motive behind it why why is she acting so why she did that why he did that there's a reason behind that isn't that right and sometimes we do that to explore in science hunting the question of this why and there's why on the purpose why am I here and that has come addresses the why that addresses Who You Are why you are here the purpose that you're here that's what y also answers and then there's another why under justification why should I believe this why is this the right thing to do you're telling me that but why should I believe that why should I accept that so all these are questions why the first time God asked that question why God accept him was in Genesis chapter four we knew the story Adam knew his wife conceived the account said I've gotten a man from the Lord she'd be against his brother Abel it was keep up the Sheep King with the till of this ground in the process of time he came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground and offered unto the Lord Abel also brought the first thing of his flock of the fat and the Lord had respect on the Abel and his offering but on the cane and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very rot and his continents fell he had a fallen face full incontinence then the Lord said unto Cain why at thou wrote why is thy continence full if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not dwell sin lied at the door and unto D shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him and Cain talk with Abel his brother came to pass and went in the field Cain rules up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said the king where is he but thy brother he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper he said what has thou done The Voice of thy brother's blood cries into me from the ground so the first question of why that God asked in the Book of Genesis was why are you you're right why are you so angry and why are your faces falling who prays the name of the Lord just want to go through scriptures and we're gonna go further right this is from Joshua chapter 5. they're in the land now they cross over you are crossed over Jordan crossing over Jordan and whatnot Moses is dead take the people over but hear what happened chapter five came to pass when all the kings of the amorites were on the side of Jordan West were all the kings of the Canaanites which are by the Sea heard of the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were Passover that their hearts melted that is drama imagine you in your kingdom and hear God dry up the river and the people coming over that is man that is the make man trembling you know the hearts start to melt watch and neither was there spirit in them anymore because of the children in Israel at that time the Lord said to Joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskin and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise so even though they were in the land they still had to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is still the circumcision that god require it doesn't annul the circumcision of the Holy Ghost it does not know the experience of the Holy Ghost people want to talk about Mary said be Eternal to me according to Thy word that's not it you know that's saying Mary had to go to the upper room that's that's wrongly divided in the road the word that's misquote in the scripture we're talking about a Divine experience where fire power white light come through you and leave a portion of himself inside of you you have to want that you have to desire that you have to look for that you can just sit down in church and believe stuff you have to say I want the reality back what God has promised is walk by faith talk by faith live by faith until you come into that Covenant of that burning light that you alone know that you have met God that you have met the pillar of fire nobody can talk about you nobody got school a lot of you your car belief takes now and yeah I believe it again they have no Revelation if you have Revelation just Upon This Rock I will build my church and the kids are there will never be well against it even the Revelation you can stand you could fall but you will stand no devil could get you to deny God no devil can get you to deny his promise [Applause] no husband no wife no children no trial nothing present nothing to come gonna stop you from standing on what God have said okay the Lord I shout bye for no white husband or husband he said whether I maintain my family or not let me maintain Christ or give the Lord some Praises this morning hallelujah hallelujah Glory maybe see that not not God and say everybody continue let them get frightened and run them out he said circumcised you see God can't break his laws his son does rise every morning in the east certainly West listen you know what I was certainly salt this time you know you sound on your own the son can't do that it is a law this is a principle hallelujah praise God and when God said his principles he can't break it for nobody not for me not for you nobody [Applause] [Music] his word is above us all and we have to respect that and reference that and acknowledge that is not what you think came to pass why Joshua they circumcised why why all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way afterwards they came out of Egypt all the people that came out was circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way when they came forth of Egypt they had not been circumcised for the children Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which were came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord they will consumed why because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord swear he would not show them the land which the Lord sway unto their fathers and he would give them a land flowing with milk and honey but their children whom he raised up in their Stead Hallelujah you get that listen when they were in Egypt God was seeing their children you know he really wasn't making us you know two million people drifting out in the message and the Moses the books and tapes but after that two million two making it a few days to cross over but because I'm on the leaf because I'm backslid Minister because of men without the anointing without Revelation without inspiration without Vision they fooled the people and so we counted this Holy Ghost Land and this land of promise is the land of the Holy Ghost we have to live in it we have to walk in it we have to wake up in it okay the Lord some Praises it's not a land of just talk [Applause] [Music] let me see it again good this land of promise is the land of the Holy Ghost he says another land you have to come out of your land to go into this land God has never tell you stay where you are you tell you come Out Come further go higher come up hello get the Lord some Praises never stay away and stay and fight up and fight up and fight up in your own flesh God wanted to catch out of that I can do not more church members you know I hear the preacher the bride and I don't know who the bride is God know who the bride is the bride will take the word the Privacy Amen to the world the dragon to die out the pride will come alive the pride will be resurrected the price will be quickened the bride will have that same spirit that brings Christ on the dead will be in that bride the word will be not Pride the secret is the word is gonna be in that bride all right [Applause] Glory Hallelujah Oh Glory to God hallelujah let's continue praise God praise God from another scripture before we get on there's some Second Kings seven believer was

and when they come to the uttermost part of the camp of the Syria behold there was no man there when you're looking to surrender to the syrians not a Monday hear why for the Lord had made the host of

Jesus speaks why calling me Lord Lord I'm doing all the things which I say Jesus speaks why why is it Lord Lord but do not the things that I say I am not your lord until you do what I say when you do what I say then you make me your lord Jesus asked that whosoever coming to me inherit my sins and do with them I would show you to whom he is like like a man which built a house dig deep lay the foundation on a rock and when the flood Rose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock and he that hear it and do it not like a man without a

it's powerful ways you know I love you it's a powerful words I love you three ways but there are other words that are powerful too a powerful one is I'm sorry three words I am sorry another three words please forgive me [Applause] bring somebody say they are sorry don't just um somebody tell you I'm sorry and you didn't like are you saying I didn't say nothing you in trouble yeah you were I ain't saying nothing you're in trouble now when that could come out your mouth please forgive me I'm sorry please forgive me for forgive me I accept your apology you have to be able to express these things [Applause] another powerful three words I'm proud of you for always I'm proud of you and this is what God wanted people to say to his sons I am proud of you I am pleased with you this is my oh my holy saying that this is mine beloved Son in whom Oh Glory to God I'm proud of him I'm pleased with him like a chip off the old black he's walking like his father he's talking like his father he's acting like his father he's doing what his father is doing okay the Lord some praises glory to God are going to test him and train him and pull him out maybe I'm going to give a ceremony and adopt him into the family oh praise God Amen let's go with brown I had in my mind as Easter sealed then I was wondering why it was so rejected and how that people would refuse it why was it so condemned and I was thinking then it is not always condemned that all the people doesn't condemn it but God here we go listen carefully God has so Made A Way that man is placed into a position to where he is forced to make decisions man cannot live on earth without making a decision God forces the issue to him so sometimes God has forced the issue that's why certain things happen and you don't know why but the why is to force the issue for you to make a decision they come like a sea in the water the water clean the water nice the water good but you're not drinking you could tell people what a good you know you could testify how a water truck you know come here it's of good water but you a tasting the water at all so go out to force the issue for you to make a decision and the recession of fruits with it good or bad and you will reap the Harvest of your decision with your fruits here we go man cannot live under it without making a decision God forces the issue to him he must make some decision and there's a time when you have to make a decision of schooling you have to make a decision of who you will marry you have to make a decision of different things now when the Garden of Eden there are two boys the decision was forced upon man to make a decision and we find that the time came between King and Abel that the decision has to be forced because the time of worship had come so when they're growing up God are ready for them yet when God ready he forced the issue he said worship time now let me see your Revelation or who you think I am Cain bought fruit and Abel bought the blood with the lamb is that right now watch this though each boy I provided a way to make a worship to God you notice between right and wrong that this is a part there's just one little breath of difference that's enough to make a shaking huh and the wrong in the last days has been prophesied to be so close to the right that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible between right and wrong Hallelujah no them boys they came to the altars made worship I was thinking how many altars this morning and churches there's beautiful flowers upon the altars and so on like that and somewhere the way it came because he brought in the fruits of the field made his service to God it was rejected because he did not come the right and precise way that God had ordained to come but he had made his offering done everything religiously just as his brother but he was rejected and because here we go this is deep because he was he was still side then it caused a jealousy to rise in him because he was greedy jealousy because he was greedy that greed has always been right and wrong wrong trying to overthrow the right to this power play with ministers and pastors and people and influencers I have parents like that you know competition between husband and wife and the mother pushing a move the wife pushing her move to have power over the children all right don't worry that doesn't mean that is not the truth it's okay you know I doesn't matter who you react you know I have a package here to deliver you know and believe you me I'm going to deliver it [Applause] watch it is it's greed always been right and wrong wrong trying to over to the right it started in Eden it come down to the ages it come down to the end International Affairs it comes down into church Affairs it come back into home life greed here we go trying to rule or ruined trying to overpower or trying to push out all that in the house so it's so easy for our wife to become a genuine Bullhead if there's such a thing genuine genuine one you know inside the house because they don't want to subject themselves they don't want to Humble themselves and if they can't humble yourself to your husband or your myself to even the word in the ministry here if your attitude is no man can't tell you anything and you're on your own and what that will God say there's a reason God put leadership a certain way there's a reason that God put orders in a way man bats didn't not in position to lead woman step forward become man messed up being Mel you know is that a man you know yeah sure again you know born m-a-l-e male doesn't mean that's a manual there are many men like sissies they're like females and God separate them male and female he did he did that so God desire for man is to put him into leadership the lead is home I remember time asking a question to somebody Brothers I said save your wife working for more money than you stand because some Churches you know what they do tell your wife stop working because the white money pocket have uh maybe messing up the man's mind I said brother I saved the wife working for more money than you you still have to provide leadership you still have to go to God to be led by the spirit of God because you are the person that God wants to talk to so the money that they issue that's secondary is the leadership under God because when Adam was under God the whole earth was under him but when you listen to his wife Eve she listened to Satan okay the Lord I shout in the house then Adam got disconnected from his Source disconnected from his Powerhouse then everything fell because the man fell how do you not know why your hoax is that it is because you mister is not in position [Applause] and you're asking why the question is why [Applause] then you blame your wife then you blame this one then you blame that one you do the blame game when God tell Adam Adam what's going on with you why are you naked why are you why are you hiding she said woman you're gonna he makes sure God know who gave him that here's how I find her I pick her up I look for her he said the woman you give me and when God comes to the woman he said he said she said he said he said well God have no words for disciplant he said I'll go let's go to my sight okay the Lord I shout in the house worry let me read this again greed has always been right and wrong wrong trying to overthrow the right he started okay so you see now this is where the nicolaitan Spirit come in among his people and afterwards no men started to take a little power smaller indeed then the conduction next mate is Bishop Ash Bishop 20 Bishop over bishop and and right up the Pope and they over through the churches so therefore God always want the sovereignty of the local church these greedy guys they may want no sovereignty they want control they want to have lean over so somebody looking you can imagine somebody look on my shoulder this morning but you can't go there you know could you imagine if I had a board behind me active you know a man says something on a woman went off that he come over I was in my videos and you might say something man Street nap yes it has come down to the ages it come down to this enters National Affairs it come down Church of years it comes down home life greed trying to rule and ruin trying to overpower push out let's say about that you see what happened in America right now everything is dictatorial the far right they don't care no more they raise their good Christians they're ready to kill anybody that don't believe in sit like them and the Donald of course he sharpened the Spear of what this press could look like Bible prophesy that America that status alarm will become that America will not be recognizable a few years from now you'd want to know where is about the home of The Bravery free they are brave and they're free oh my my my do you get what I'm saying now things are changing you know changing you know you have to change you know are you the same person it was two years ago five years ago something wrong with you every day things are changing the question is why are you in that condition what is hitting you from breaking out this is the challenge you inspire we'll be talking with preacher we'll be teaching all right we see things working everywhere it always has the same thing trying to overrule overall down to the Old Testament God in the days of the prophets I got several of them written here he said he in a garden when the true voice of God the true worship of God was condemned sent out and killed in the Garden of Eden the voice of God hushed by greed and jealousy has been that way in the church ever since the harsh the voice of God if you notice as soon as the voice of evil was silent God was upset to take his place which was nothing but a pre-easter right he said God kept his voice alive with the prophets they spoke the word of God they stoned them as soon as they would Stone one put him away God would raise up another one they stole that one and put him away glories up another one he always kept his witness alive down to the ages he kept his voice alive before the people all the way from Eden so we supposed to be eunuchs we're not supposed to bring our own seed for the Branham what the son of man was revealing Asana man the son of man was revealing the prophet Malachi 4 which is Luke 17 today Jesus Christ was revealed through a prophet and the son of man is the soul of The Good Seed so if I'm seizing this message every book you pick up our season it once you read it you hear it you're listening you're getting seeds inside your system the devil can't stop them see he's going inside of you once they're hearing it listening to it please be preaching it it sees inside of here so I'm not supposed to come and preach my seed I supposed to preach this word seed because the secret is the word is in the bride how did the word get into the bride you received the seed the son of man is the sower of The Good Seed so immune the night have the cedar your flesh might be corrupt and in problems but instead of the seal because the season for the heart oh can the Lord has shout not for your head some get it in the head and they walk away we're not talking about them we talk about you here glory to God some fall upon rocks that jump up jump up jump up and they jump right out they die up after a while we're not talking about them we're talking about you who tied up and wrapped up and Tangled Up with thorns and thistles okay the Lord I shout that not bringing fruit to perfection Glory Glory love God so we're not talking about Wayside we're not talking about Stony people we're talking about them returns and thistles and whatnot we're not bringing for food to Perfection things that let them alone to help your life whether it's social media whether it's friends whether it's family things tying you up taking up your time praise God messing up your mind you have to release yourself from that [Applause] Jonah chapter one I want to read that scripture there's a man with a high colon who's had a run it was not race he did them about the contestants not the word of the Lord came the Jonah the son of Amit I saying chapter one of Jonah just to arise go to another that great City and cry against it for the wickedness to come before me no God know what they will do you know they need somebody to cry against it and sometimes somebody has a cry in the house and the home and the church somebody will cry you can't be seeing things and not saying anything you're encouraging sin the encouraging slackness they can't be hiding for one another hiding for this one blocking for this one what what nice foolishness you are accessory and just as guilty if you love me tell me the truth if you love me tell me my faults if you love me tell me where I'm for it feeling that's what love does you don't leave me to fall on the face okay the Lord I shout in the house you don't leave me to die [Music] from the presence of the Lord he running from the anointing he running from leadership he runs from Direction and he went to Japan found a ship going to churches and he said pay the fear there of yet money went into it go with them from the presence of the Lord so he had in the presence so and he grew nongso but the Lord did not man no say the Lord but the Lord sent out a great will into the sea who sent it the lord and there was a mighty Tempest on the sea so the ship was like to be broken it was five then the marinas was afraid and cried every manner to his God all of a sudden everybody get religious who are sharply who are beads who hit and pan who ring and Bell who's smoking canceling and incense everybody praying right now that is what condition does you know it is break people you know it is bring it to your knees you know this ship wrecking you know it have no foundation and National the boat rocking you know it's not like a stand up and concrete you know you need waters you know [Applause] [Music] of them but Jonah was down into the side of the ship fast asleep sometimes when you're running from God you sleep extra you almost don't want to wake up you almost don't want God to talk to you at all just only pray very shortly bless me Lord Jesus name amen because I long enough God will tell you no but we speak Jonah fast asleep master came to him and said what meanest though a sleeper I'm still reading arise call upon thy God he's a Believer he's able to be a Christian ship rocking do not sleeping yeah and he's sleeping ship rocking believer sleeping emotional make emotional she said what means the whole sleeper arise called upon thy God so if be that God will think upon us that we perish not and they said everyone to his fellow come let us cast lots that we may know whose cause this evil is come upon us so the car slots and the Lord fell upon Jonah them fellas rolling dice and Jonah get caught in that how how could you explain unbelieving Men cast lots and find out this Jonah foreign [Music] for whose causes evil is upon us what is that occupation where's your push he's a believer you believe this message you're Christian what is your occupation from whence comes down what is that country and what people are though he said unto them I am a Hebrew and I fear the lord the god of Heaven which had made the Sea and the Dragon foreign why has doubt done this for the man knew he had fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea rotten was tempestuous he said take me up and cast me fought into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know for my sake this great Tempest is upon you this is a level of honesty and sincerity that a man come to The Possession and point to say you know what is my fault because my wife is me not my uncle is me it's not for children it's me it is my fault and if you throw me out take me out of the way watch this one nevertheless the man ruled her to bring it to land but they could not for the sea wrote and was tempestuous against them wherefore they Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord let us not perish for this man's life lay not Upon Us innocent blood for thou Lord has done it as it pleases thee they took up Jonah casting forth into the sea and the Sea see some region fling him over and sometimes there's certain things God wants you to fling fling it overboard get it out of your life amen and you will see all calm things you shall change things you're coming into obedience you're coming back to the original commission that God called you and give you then the men fear the lord accidentally and offer the sacrifice of the Lord and made those and the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah Juno was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights and Jesus said as Juna was in the belly shall be we know the story Jonah end up opening when the fish opening mouth Jonah said land straight to never God has been prepared so Jonah around natashes and permissive will but the ship of the of this the fish took him as God's perfect will so God could take permissive and get it back into perfect it's all part of God's program Jonah here one of the Minor Prophets we find an example of all of us every one of us we always running from something we run from trouble we want one from responsibilities we all prone to do that we are prone to run and we have to stand and face it out we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to work as much our rubbers and thieves today they just don't want to work they find you must work and they must rub you and they get you know a fast pay sometimes we found ourselves they want to run from work we don't want to work some people just think they can make their living without working I think as Solomon said watch an ants and so on we got so many things we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility everybody has got to face a certain responsibility look when you choose your wife to get married choose your husband you've got to take a responsibility when you when you build a home nice pretty home then remember the mad woman you have the responsibility of Tourism children and you've got to think of them pretty slick walls and going to have a little dirty handprints all over them you got a responsibility of educating the children you've got responsive clothing and freedom some people do great work some people do terrible work but it's still a responsibility you see some people put on a good work some people don't have bad work but it's a responsibility to train and if you don't know you get the ability you you learn you you want to absorb knowledge and information that you could teach that you could support your family isn't right many times it is true that ministers many times shook a responsibility for standing for the child of God when they're confronted with it they will shoot up responsibility oh praise God so Jonah I want to challenge you don't shook responsibility take up responsibility ask God to give a responsibility because responsibility makes you responsible praise God Holyoke have a business and give it to our son that we were done three word he's not responsible he gonna mess up the business you spend 20 years to build a business and in one six months your son breast break it right back down so you want a son like the father thinking like the father having a vision of what the father has isn't that right oh glory to God glory to God there's one more are you enjoying the world today all right second Kings chapter one verse one then more rebel against Israel after the death of ihab fell down to the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire to balzi verb the god of ekron whether I shall recover the disease so he sentences find out what going on with him but first three the angel of the Lord 17 Elijah the Tish bite arise go to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and see unto him is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of belzibar the god of Akron now therefore Dusty at the Lord Thou shalt not come down from that bed without going up thou shall surely die and Elijah Departed that bed is that dead man inside of there is there a god why you want to go to bed why you want to go backwards when a reality of behold I send you Elijah the Prophet come in this hour God is not dead he may be silent but he's not dead he may not respect react but he's not dead he may just be silent but not dead God is not dead he's still alive he kept us all these years Oh Glory to God amen amen Jeremiah 8 22 is there an Obama in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of my daughter of my people recovered why oh blessed being of the Lord brother Branham if God is going to bring the people to judgment it has to have something to judge and by it has to have a standard if you're going to judge him by the Catholic church and the Greek church is lost so God's standard is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word the word of God he will judge them by this Bible for this is the word and we wonder why we got so much a confusion so much organization so much differences separating Brotherhood is because there is no bam in Gilead it's because he has no physician there I wonder if God would ask us that question no God was the physician but it was the king's stubborn will here we go check yourself now and that's what the matter in the nation today it's people own stubborn will nobody else you know is you and you you fighting about you there's some people don't want to be spoken to because they want to do their own thing they don't want nothing come Cherry praise God and Jesus when he prayed our father he said praise God thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth when Jesus he said not my will but thy will be done but when you have a stomach will that's not defending all together not because we don't have the same God across the Red Sea with his people and fed them 40 Years of wilderness it's not because we don't have the same God we are in the beginning this is the people-owned stubborn way they don't want to bow down they don't want to have anything to do with Holiness and purity of living the Bible way of living they would rather belong to a church put their name on a book watch and live like the rest of the world and that the bow down to the promises and the Commandments of almighty God praise God but Stephen read it in the exaltation in permission if you love me keep my Commandments if you love me keep my word you're showing your love to God you probably say how do we show our love to God by conducting ourselves with joy I miss the trials he in his wisdom send away because I missed your child's day is a possibility so you can't get worthy to be tried worthy yeah to be tested Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God so today you don't have to stay in Hell doable why I am in hell you can come out of hell glory to God because heaven come down to dig you out of hell it was a power that take us out the Catholic and baptism Methodist you know we couldn't walk over that you know this message came with a power in

may be seated praise God praise God so sometimes the reason things are not going the way they are people get away from the word you will never be able to get straightened out until we get back on the right path if a patient went to a doctor and laid on his steps and he had some kind of fever going to kill him doctor come to the door and say I've got a mess in here you see I just ain't come on in I'll give you the medicine the injection inoculation I don't want your medicine now still I can help you if you come in I'm not coming in and the man lay down the doctor step and died died on the doctor's step because he won't accept the inoculation of typhoid fever whatever it is that he had he won't accept the inauguration for it the man dies right on the doctor's doorstep you can't blame the doctor he had the medicine and they had taken it because somebody on Facebook said something somebody on YouTube said something somebody posting as doctor they know doctor nobody talking and they're talking and they're sharing and they're sharing all kind of crazy stuff you can't blame the medicine it's the man that's usually blame dying on the doctor's doorstep with the disease that there's nothing to be cured can cure to the inside you know God has the medicine inside of his kingdom that will cure every sin disease amen that's not good enough there are more people here that should be saying amen God have mercy in his kingdom that get your any sin disease people sit right under church doorsteps not only that they said right in the Pew and die and are lost and go to hell you know sometimes we don't think about that you know we think everybody had come in church and believe and get baptized going to heaven that's not true you know foreign some go straight to hell the minute says might make some gymnastic and flip a nice nice talk over them in the courtroom but some of them going downstairs you know because they don't believe they don't really believe they come to church the physical being here but they don't really believe if you believe you'll obey [Applause] I want a bigger amen than that if you believe you will obey your obedience vindicate that you believe what you say you believe [Applause] people sit in the church hear the message of God and believe them and won't accept it they wouldn't say well no I don't believe it that's right some of them will come say they agree with it I believe it's right but you won't do it you will die dying in the pews of the church because they won't accept the remedy it takes a little bit of a popularity of the people it takes a little bit off from them a bit what they're afraid of the new birth you know and he put is a mess I don't care what it is it's a big pen a pink decorated hospital it's a mess so it's

and he was riding upon his ass and his two Silvers with him and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and he saw Jordan in his hand and he asked him aside out of the way and went into the field and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way but the angel of the Lord stood in the part of The Vineyards a wall being on this side a wall on that side and when they asked all the angel of the Lord she trusts herself against the wall and crushed billion's foot against the wall and he smoked again and the anger of the Lord went further and stood in the narrow place but there was no way to turn left or right and when they asked all the angel of the Lord she fell along on the Balaam and belam anger was kindled and he smoothed the ass with the staff and the Lord opened the mouth of

let's settle in right now you may be seated Hallelujah whatever see started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it's the same seed in the last days the true bright church will come to The Headstone she will be a super Church a super race actually near him day in the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is in order to be United with him how could you neither be Christ with obedience image this is serious take up the responsibility but around make them pledge to pray daily until every one of these virtues is in the Statue of Minds you have work to do you have no time to gossip you have no time to fool around you have time to fight to get this inside of you every one of them virtues [Applause] [Music] they talking about the bride will be the manifestation of the word of God listen to spot this is what I want to get to notice the harmony of the father and son this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it nothing can Hammer not even debt I want to get to those in the bride do only his will there's a bomb today no one can make them do otherwise no father no mother no Uncle no brother no boss no government no power to make them do otherwise they're in the bride we're talking about Mrs Jesus Christ do only his will no one can make him do otherwise they have Dusty at the Lord but they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was in his early Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things he must now do he will know fulfill to the bride that work which he left for this specific time let's go put the brown notice either by faith in God or for a more existing sacrifice and they cannot believer thought it was the works of his own hands his fruits his beautiful offerings that he brought God what God would recognize and it made a clash we find Abraham lotada Clash there's a clash when the colonel and spiritual meet there was always a clash so we have to have Clash in the church always our Clash in a church that kind of people in this church that spiritual people in the church the kind of people is troublemakers they had they don't want to hear they don't want to listen nice kind of people they don't want to take instructions they can't that they can't help themselves that's how they are until something break into them and make them spiritual they are carnal this war is in this church this war is in the bride this war is in your house and this war is in you oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah get the Lord some praises don't look at nobody you know because inside you have a fight going on my will your will my will not my will it's having a battle going on oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah all right so watch Once one is Son of God one is Son Of Satan Jesus and just loose and Judas right kill the neighbor Clash now notice the natural always try to type the spiritual but as in Jacob and Israel it will not work it would not I believe that Esau was actually a better man than Jacob in the sight of man so if you're looking by sighterman he's always a better man was a better man a better man a better man a better man a better man a spiritual man a spiritual man he wanted a built right real bad another song you know that song right there praise God so is it watching like the natural ESO was a better man but God wasn't looking about a man is what a better job maybe he's got better qualifications Jacob was a rascal we know that but right don't don't talk too much about that you know that's a stimulate him boy when you have birthday is an excite him my God he said a smile when you have birth right so a big smile come across his face because that's his thing he after okay the Lord has shout and he had the right kind of mother praise God she put on a good work oh glory of God she gives Jacob support because she know by Revelation the younger they all never sell the younger okay the Lord a shout glory to God before he was born he said check out my love he saw ahead you think she has to love this bride she just love this bride we were born in sin but he loved you we worship in equity but he love you when he wasn't sin he still love you he still love you this morning oh great praise him praise him praise him he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you he chose you [Applause] [Music] Jacob here we go his whole soul wants to get the boat right and that is what God recognizing him to be spiritual his whole soul was against the Holy Ghost Oh Glory they got every service every time every prayer meeting he saw a possibility maybe today is my day maybe today is my time oh glory to God he wasn't talking negative he was talking positive and he had the right kind of monitor back him up right kind of spiritual influencer to back him up he'd have mothers back on the chair in the wrong way wrong direction oh give the Lord some praises there we go this is deep notice it always caused them natural to hit the spiritual not the other way around this is the one-way Street right now one way it caused the natural to hit the spiritual it caused King to hate Abel it caused Korra to hit Moses it caused Judas to hate Jesus on and on it goes it caused the natural to heal the spiritual just as king and the beginning is so they say why this person treats me like that kind of natural but they can't stand you but they're not with you watch this even they try to destroy the influence to disconnect people from the ministry when I passed the Blaster next minute killing them to other people ministers on a big stab and a knife behind it back so God bless you brother yeah you caught jealousy you try to just throw the influence to try to destroy everything because it's nothing but jealousy it started in King but it was jealousy it's still the same today when the natural canal and spiritual meet together it's proved with Satan not aware because jealousy comes from Satan no jealousy come from Satan I will be like the most high I want to be like God I want to be on top of everybody and God put the boots on him and kick him out because of jealousy comes from Satan and then because of impersonation of the truth somebody tried to impersonate something that isn't there isn't ordained to do that see God watch does not change his mind about his original word who he calls who he ordains no one else can take that place no one else could take Moses place no matter how much chorus raised up how much data it was Moses God has called regardless and if people here we go are you ready and what you're cycling now buckle on your belt I am moving yet and I groove here and I'll stop it until I finish this book are you ready to close yet you know so don't even think about it I ready to rumble okay the Lord some praises Hallelujah here we go if the people won't walk in this perfect will he does have a permissive will he will let you walk just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the Earth to sex no sir God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth breathe a breath of life into him he became a living Soul he took that man a help mate made a wife to him that was God's first on original will When sin come in and did things it did he permitted man to marry a wife legally and I've turned by her multiply replenish the Earth that's how you're going to do it but you see it was never his perfect will therefore all these things at the beginning has to have an end all sin has to come to Annihilation all sin has to be done away with therefore in the great Millennium when the Resurrection comes we will not have to be reborn Again by our fathers and mothers but God like he did in the beginning will call man from the dust of the earth his help mate with him that's the way he did it at the beginning okay the Lord some praises so therefore God does never change his mind about anything but he will permit you to go on now this is a long way around to get where I want to go and saying here God will permit you to do something this is this is deep and even bless you in doing it but still it isn't his perfect will God permitted Israel to take a law Exodus 19 chapter when Grace had already given them a prophet pillar fire sacrificial lamb delivering power they cried off our law it wasn't God's will but it was injected because man wanted it and he was cursed by the very law that he wanted it is best to have God's will that's what he taught us that will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go wrong get along some way when you go you find yourself going on you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not his perfect will he permits us as I said he will not let it be his perfect will but he will make it work the honor and blessed perfect will childbearing by sex is one of that all right do you get that now okay all right so Moab okay now difference between Mormon Israel what was the difference in them fundamentally both were right Moab did not have the Vindication of God with them they were only a nation a group of celebrities Israel had a prophet with them they are expecting rock with them they had a pillar of fire they had a brass Supreme for healing that the blessings of God moving right among them and they will call Ocean of God but more I've seen Israel with something that didn't have they seen a mighty power among Israel it was a prophet and that Prophet was Moses they know that when the battle went wrong they raised up his hands held it up there and the battle changed so it didn't have such as that and they tried to match it with politics with a political pull they sent over another country a higher profit to come over so they can have a prophet you are Prophet Ayah Prophet too right and they will have power among them like Israel had among them do you see the kind of comparison can you see the Canada church today notice they were both going to have Prophets The only difference was Moses the prophet of God his King was God that's where you get his orders Balaam he had a king his King was balak said come down and curse me these people right come down now we want to notice that this man was a prophet ordained of God but he sold his birthrights for political reasons you can't say is not a prophet of God in the prophet he can't say you know seek the Lord the heaven God he was but he's one of them that could be bought notice the difference each had heard Moses was God balak was but Balaam was balak notice God said to the alarm after he heard the true cut decision don't go yes then God says well go no you can do the same thing here we go if you don't want to walk in the truth listen to this young people listen to this carefully if you don't want to walk in the truth you can go and have a great ministry certain you can but you are taking his permissive will you be a walking over his word you you possibly suddenly in permissive will so you cannot just say God is blessing me are you in his permissible or are you in his perfect will God's will which one like he did bailam he was a success but he couldn't curse the people he couldn't do it cause every time he starts with a curse he blessed see he couldn't do it and when he come being prosperous and achievement he told his people afterwards you know what he tries to get him to come his adultery and that's what bring the Judgment of God upon them oh hallelujah praise God Amen but Abraham said this you know you talk about here we found out Bill and went down there he began to teach the people an error he ran away in the way of Balaam or what he did he taught balak and the children of Israel to commit adultery and a plague struck the nation of Israel and the people thousands of them died in one day and while they were there before the altar of God praying here come an Israelite man with a mediate woman an international woman and went into the tent and the priest's son walked over took a javelin and killed them both and that state goes right could imagine the sin of adultery and that whole thing but judgment to the world camp and when this priest son saw that being they're gonna attend they killed both of them and the Rats stopped Hallelujah note something had to be done to stop hallelujah praise God I'll get two women on that that's all right what happened Balaam he's succeeded in within Israel what did he do he weakened the camp God let him go and weaken their Camp it polluted the whole Camp when some Doctrine starts that's not the Bible like I am Holy Spirit Doctrine all his false teaching that's foolishness that's not God at all God has speak that that is not in the Bible but the penalty they push it people receive it in their spirits and they run off with that Plumb of the word of God Plumb off the beaten path watch when watch when some Doctrine starts that's not the Bible truth it pollutes the whole Camp somebody raised up with a different idea like Korra say well this that the other I got a different idea it pollutes the whole Camp that's what done the whole church camp today remember here we go don't tell me right now they had to eat Angels food they had the word of God every night made manifest they eat the food they drink from the rock they did see Miracles they watched Moses seen his prophecies and then finally they listened to a false teacher coming among them and teach wrong he weakened the camp and prospered by it he might build a building on a building he might have great denomination he might have added thousand times thousand gone Green books Mighty works that's all right but as long is not with the word of God you better stay away from it God don't change his mind stay right with the word cause that is what going to come out of the end the word praise God when you say brother Branham I do so and so it don't bother me my mother let me do it don't bother me I had no pressure at home so what the problem is the home slack there is no real Anchor Point in the house there is real no straight out how your children will respond to straighten out in the church when you as parents are straight them in the house to talk to me like that my father rebuked me like that my father don't correct me like that my mother don't say nothing at all let me put I'll paint my toes paint my nose paint my fingernails everywhere I want to paint when they come to church they want to tell me about paint you say brother man I might do something so don't bother me God blessing me every day I sing in the spirit that's in the spirit he permit it go ahead that's right but what are you doing going to do I wear shorts I do this it don't bother me I know my faith is in Christ not what I wear it's not familiar but the Bible said there was something to it you make a stumbling block like they landed but God will prosper you why He blesses me I don't doubt that is permissive will not his perfect will God doesn't change his mind because He blesses you he bless Israel right there for 40 years what did they do married wise raise families kiss the children pay their ties live right out there and God bless him in the wilderness sentiment manner on and on and every one of them perish cause they've never kept his original permissive his original word the top of the permissive way go ahead but you remember when the left cameish they never journeyed any further they just went around in the wilderness where they could have been out in two days after that there could have been a promised land they Journey 40 years every one of them died but Joshua Caleb the ones that stayed with the original word God help us God don't change his will he don't change his mind but he will bless you oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen let's head to home stretch watch look God said go on he will give him permission to go on there's a permissible of God and not the original will of God you see what trouble he got into and any man here we go that builds anything any organization anything outside upon the word of God is shaking sons and will fall every group every Ministry that got built upon the world will fall I look out is standing strong now it will fall because the only word are going to understand it has to peel upon the rock it will die assures anything because the word of God is growing body the word of God is the growing body of the Bride you can't have all foot all arm all time these things come in their season so adoption coming in a season anybody come to claim the adapter now just as a clung it had after the season of adoption praise God I can't be no serious thing a man claiming to power he castles Some Devil he adopted is that right the problem says somebody claims something try it feel free to claim anything if you want to claim to be a prophet fine you'll have a child too Hallelujah try that see this is right if it is right work with it and say thank you Lord send us some more until everybody find their place are you with me we supposed to try we are supposed to say because they come from America or before you come from Jacksonville because you come from there is right no it has to be Underwood Oh Glory to God isn't that right hallelujah praise God these things come in a season oh let's finish off here now so this is the cap of it here but abandon in the exposition he said to Jesus he was talking about watch Israel came to the borders of Moab missions get ready we are brothers let us pass to your land if all people are no animals eat or drink anything we will pay for it Israel saying that King palak got very excited that head of the nicolaitan punch nicolitan Bunch was about was not about to let the church come true with signs and wonders and diverse manifestation of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God look look how powerful but I'm reflect this year foreign bunch come true with the signs wonders divers manifestations the Holy Ghost with their face shining with the glory of God it was too risky he might lose some of his crowd so balak refused an evil Pastor in fact so great was his fear of them he went to an island Prophet called balam and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition the almighty took us Israel and rather than important but Balaam being eager to take part in a political fear become a great man was only too glad to do so but seeing he had to approach and receive audience from God to get the people kissed he could not do it by himself he went to ask God if they could have permission to go now isn't that just like nicolaitan we have today the curse everyone that won't go their way when Bill yeah the Chris shocked I just laughed for that no he said he's a shock but you're a shark they're watching his seat and calling me a shop you see we're not in a position to judge people like that this one Falls I can't say that Force Anointed The United come here to make them false when you're looking hit them so they will be false anointed Dynamics I don't make them that and dynamic will make you too bright when Dynamics hit you so all them for just go just spill others out of you so forget it then my paper rainbows called rainbow one and taking God rainbow to make make it their foolishness but but we call it a real rainbow isn't that right all right when God saw his perversity he told them to get up and go quickly quickly Saturday donkey went his way he realized it was simply go up permissible you wouldn't be able to kiss them he went if he went 20 times and tried 20 times how Bill are my people people today they believe in three Gods get baptized and three ties and said the name a God will send the spirit upon them as he did upon they still go and believe in exactly right and I hope that you don't go here believe in your own thoughts and ideas and you'll leave here with a different picture in your mind that you want to believe the word and do his will all right they say God bless us it must be all right I know he blessed you I don't deny that but it's the same organizational route that belam took it's Defiance the god word it was Defiance it was false teaching oh my hello so balam went down I want to close so Balan went on and set up set motors for the clean piece of sacrifice he killed a ram signifying economy sire he knew what to do to approach unto God he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics did you hear that he said Bill I'm happy mechanic just right but not the Dynamics he had the Seven Seas but he didn't have seven Thunders the Capstone to kept the pyramid he didn't have that Hallelujah can't you see the Nicolaitans there was Israel in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same thing but only one had the signs following and only one had God in their midst form won't get you anywhere it can't take the place of spirit manifestation did you get together and get your manifestation oh my Hallelujah they had a cloud by day Israel pillow Fire by night they had a smitten Rock they had a prison serpent they had signs wonders they were Vindicated Notting themselves but in God God didn't have any respect for those Nicolaitans in the PSD lld and DD all their final organization the best man could boast he didn't have respect unto Israel but he did have respect on Israel but they had the word Vindicated among them isn't that right praise will begin to play something and she was free now she was a blessed people through the sovereignty of God certainly Moab looked down on her all their Nations did too organization always looked down on the unorganized and either will by determination bring them into organization or destroy them when they won't come what the prophet says they're going to be organizing he said you are to join or you get cut off or have no in between that's why you said the churches will become still houses they're gonna put boxes and things like that praise God I wonder how the online situation gonna be at that time a shaking time is coming friends don't think that you have a shaken it come yet you had a deal with door shaking right now and Shake That shaken up you are you have to be the shaker and stop shaking did you get

nights we're going to close this Bible the last time the last song is going to be song last sermon preached the last prayer line will be called the last sinner will come in and then what dear God we don't want your permissive will father let us walk in your perfect will let us not just take a word here dear and make it fit our Dogma Creed or something let us take the word as it is believe in the Full Gospel all that Jesus taught us to do we do not believe that the Acts of the Apostles as a framework we believe is the word of God is the acts of your Holy Spirit and the apostles and we believe
