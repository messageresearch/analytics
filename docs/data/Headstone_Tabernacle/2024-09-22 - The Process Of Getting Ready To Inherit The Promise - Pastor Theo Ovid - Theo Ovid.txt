the sin out the evil out cleanse Hearts cleanse lives sanctify your people by Your Word this morning as we wait upon you in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you before you take the Comforts of your seat just want to go to the scripture Psalms 103:7 Joshua 3 1:5 and 1 Corinthians chapter 6 15 to 20 you can look at the screen if you don't have get ready Psalms 103 want to read the scripture this morning thank you musician and but thank you brother Steven for such inspiring some service one verse Psalms 103:7 says he made his known he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel Joshua chapter 3:1 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before the Passover and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it and there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits of by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way here to before Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you all last scriptures from 1 Corinthians chapter 6 reading verse 15 KN ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of aot God forbid what know you not that he which is joined one harot is one body for two say he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man do it is without the body but he that commit fornication sinth against his own body what KN ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you're not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your word and we pray a bless it interpret our hearts as we wait upon you in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise the Lord God bless you and welcome thanks for coming thanks for coming this morning last Sunday I preached a message the r return to the land of promise amen something that you should listen to again because you're trying to understand what God how God sees things I'll say it this way you have your point of view and I have mine that's okay but what does God sees I ain't seen it so I ain't seen it so good that's fine you see it however you want to see it but always remember there are treatings your view my view and God's view my view is nothing that's not important the main view is how God sees things Prophet said God sends a guide God want you to remember his appointed guide I will send you another comforter he will guide you to the truth isn't that right the church today reject that how can you ever expect to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to guide us what we take some Cardinal some Bishop some general overseer somebody like that to guide us when the Holy Spirit was given to guide us so the but the man above the word the man above God the man above the spirit brother BR in a guide now the Holy Spirit speaks the word I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now this Jesus speaking that but when he comes he will guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished here we go to know who God is what what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full stature of sons of God Amen if you know who God is how he lives what you doing in a bar because we supposed to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being your own body is not even yours your body the Bible call it the Temple of the Holy Ghost how you ganja that up how you going smoke that up you understand what I'm saying and you will see what the devil wants to do I've seen it clean so we spoke about returning to the land of promised and I just want to just just touch that a little bit what is the promise to the New Testament believer hold on okay what is the land promised to the New Testament believer so in the Old Testament they coming from natural land to a natural land isn't that right but what is the land promised to the New Testament believer the promise is the holy spirit Joel 2:28 it shall come to pass I'll Port my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy now the Holy Spirit not come to come to Port upon dogs and cats and chickens and goats that's have flesh too you know the Holy Spirit Come depart upon individuals amen but God cannot pour it on filthy vessels filthy people that's why there is a processed inherit this land and you have to understand the ways of [Music] godall I read scripture in Psalms a very notable scripture they say Moses know his ways the people saw his acts the people saw God sent plagues and FES and frogs and they they saw the acts of God but they never met God they wasn't ever in the presence of God they didn't see the pillar of fire they didn't know the ways of God that is what they had was to learn and be taught and some when and when you think you know you don't know you don't know what you don't know that's why God sent a prophet that you could be taught the ways of God people see the acts of God and still reject God they see plagues they feel this and they still went and make golden Calen yes because they didn't know who God was and today people seeing acts and they want to do that why people caught up in things and manifestations and all kind of crazy stuff without even inquiring if that is God or not but Abraham watch the promised land to the New Testament believer the promise is the holy spirit did you notice Joshua before the Cross Jordan he said go to the midst of the camp clean your clothes sanctify every one of you let no man come at his wife for within three days you will see the glory of God it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise that's where I get the title from the process of getting ready to inherit the promise the another Carnival B you're tripping it you jumping church and you're chipping down the road this is another man they not even a message man this have nothing to do with what the message world has and what it think is supposed to be this is to find out what God thinks about how we supposed to be this is this is not matching up to me standard this is matching up to what God say in the Bible [Applause] here he said you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost don't defile it you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost don't corrupt it [Applause] glory to God don't flirt with it don't go and commit fornication with it it's not your body it's his body he give it to you it's not your life it's his life he give it to you it's not your eyes it's his eyes he put them eyes inside of you oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God not man you're serving it's God you're serving that is the promise here we go the promised land is to be long in the message no the promised land is to live in this land of Holy [Music] Spirit you think God check how much cars you have how much houses they have how much boats how much planes how much this they have how much money in bank account you think God checking that right now you have a man Nam P call him Puff Daddy he have plenty names he puffing in jail right now without cigarettes and he's a billionaire but he's a filthy man and he has to face the Judgment both he and the other side too what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul you have a soul inside of there your mother didn't give you that your father didn't give you that your husband didn't give that your wife didn't give it that you're not obligated to your mother you're not obligated to your father you're obligated to God himself oh give the Lord a shout you're not obligated a Grandpa or Grandma you're obliga is the God [Applause] himself the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you hear what to live in this land outside this land you're walking in the flesh you're walking on a caral man a natural man you're walking in a way where the devil have opportunities for you he said look him going a flesh what so no challenge for the devil a man walking stinking stinking flesh jealousy in him he get vexed he get angry he say what he want he do what

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the promised land is to live in the land of the holy spirit that is God's promise for the church that's B opinion no that is God's promise for the church that would they say head Tabernacle no that is God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit Jesus Jesus returned after the Wilderness in the power of the spirit and say the spirit is upon me for he had anointed me to preach the gospel and to do this and do that nothing happening yet and the anointing was upon Him Rising him as he was bringing that word he was anointed with the word of the Living God the word was alive it was present oh glory to God hallelujah and the devil was trembling everywhere he was about to heal the sick he was about to raise the dead he was about to cast out Devils he was under the power of the that same power promised to the church that same power promised to you you'll be Victorious on your job you'll revoke victorious in your house wherever you go you going to be victorious Hall glory to God because you're not in the flesh in the spirit God will give you discernment in the spirit God will unlock your minds in the spirit God will give you wisdom God will give you knowledge God will give you understand handing because you're in the spirit his [Applause] Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world hallelujah it's another land and here what here the B you have to come out of the conditions that you have been in to come to live in that Promised Land the land not coming to you

grandchildren but I'm getting out of here oh give the Lord a shout [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we are journeying a journey you have to come out come on now of the conditions come on now that you've been in that's what this service is about the process of getting ready to inherit the promise you got to come out of the condition that you have been in to come to live in this whole Promised Land if we read this in the message world now they will sit down like they would uh because they think they reach lying somebody lied to them to receive the promise remember the promise is you shall receive power from the pastor by the my he preaching no he said you shall receive power from on high the on high part no man could give you what is on high no teacher could give you from what is no Bishop no Apostle no Prophet could give it for What on high not even Jesus could give it to them he said if I don't go the comforter will not come he said when I go it will come he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost hey come upon you it has to come upon you not no quote not no text not no scripture not no sermon not no message this thing have to oh give the Lord some prais inside of [Music]

from Justin Ville power from [Music] high power from some Apostle in Europe liar power from on high some man in Trinidad power from who [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he I hope this service make you uncomfortable I'm not trying to make it comfortable not this morning not today tell the devil not today today is not that kind of day today is not the kind of day sorry [Music] [Applause] hallu this building here is not the Tabernacle come on now come on now we call this headstone Tabernacle but this is not the Tabernacle God talking about here you are the Tabernacle God is talking about I know you're looking around but don't look around I talking to you your body is what God looking for not only God looking for your body the devil looking too oh give the Lord some Praises did you get that not only God looking for your body the devil looking for your body too because the devil have to find a body to use just as God have to find a body to use right now God using this body to you oh give the Lord a shout right now I am bringing the word to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you so God want to have real Tabernacles sir yes sir real temples Jesus said it this way sanctify them yes sir by thy truth Glory they couldn't escape that they couldn't say well I following Jesus I following Jesus where you going have a process he says sanctify them by thy truth that word is truth so even the disciples have to be Sanctified by the word so where you going all right all right you have to come out the condition that you in [Applause] some Christ of God listen to this the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body right that recognize his only his body his flesh is word so if somebody is truly baptized with the Holy Spirit they can only recognize the word you know anything else outside the word have nothing to do with that because the spirit and the word is one so if you have God's spirit you going to recognize God's word put BR some church order 7th October 195 we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that a after a person is being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it is possible here we go that this same person could have habits all right such as drinking smoking doing things they should not do God called them they are Justified they are predestinated they elected but they could have habits he call it filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person amen for service to the Lord so come you come God take you as you are you're still smoking you still want to do this and that's okay but it doesn't stop there because it's a process you don't take a egg and some flour and put some sugar just Str in your over and say kick you just make a over mess that you don't do that you want it quick so you just fling it in the OV fling the egg fling the flow fling and say cake aush and a rush and a hurry the off not respecting that and those materials are join to do that it to put you a process you had to crack the eggs put the flour put the sugar put the this put it that put it that blend it together then get the right temperature all of that you know is process then after the timing and you pick it out oh that's smelling good boy that that a good one almond cake already so watch this we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:12 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age we are not living am and we believe that after the person have been Sanctified unclean habit has gone from that person all right he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer so let's go over that slowly let's take it slowly and put a magnifying glass on there so it's not like a carnival B we say just e b band moving and your dancing chipping to inste pay for the mask and pay for the costume just hear the music and they jumping and you chipping and you part of that band this is not that leave carnival on the street this is God's plan the habits are gone why because the bu is now Sanctified we believe that then not before so if you're not becoming Sanctified you ain't want no Holy Ghost yet you're lying to yourself you don't believe you're going to get any Holy Ghost if you're believing you going to get the Holy Ghost you're looking to receive the Holy Ghost you will get yourself Sanctified all habits G on we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which come as a filling to the believer many times as I've it like picking up a glass out of a chicken yard justification is picking it up to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to The Sinner he's still filthy so you pick up a glass God pick you up with your smoking with your drinking with your running around with all your life all your filthiness he pick you up and because he elected you and he chose you he pick you up then what happen after that he washes the glass that sanctification he cleanse the glass not you in your natural ha will not pick up a filthy glass and just take P me some water a thirsty as miserable as you might be this morning not one of you are mentally upset cucko in your head to pick up a glass more you go say give some water I want to drink I drink it you would first wash the glass so God have to wash you before he could use you I only hear 10% people amen is you I'm talking to then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word it mean clean and set aside for service let's go to party tonight no I am clean and set aside well you know who come in is a party in all and white that's not the clean we talking about and not a clean party because they were in White I am clean and set aside for service hallah we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gift spoken 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Ghost comes in to take up those gifts I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts are calling without repentance that we are born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and we are even become adults when we were children the gifts that we have of God is in us then and only the filling of the Holy Ghost put these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and Prophets and Gifts of tongues nine spiritual gifts we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in every local church well but over not feeling your feeling becomes filthiness when your feeling questions the word well why thinking he said my thoughts are not your thoughts what are you thinking you have to say Lord I Repent of my own thoughts I want your thoughts I want your mind oh praise God praise God look in Acts 10 we know this story about man called Cornelius he was a devout man man that feared God with all his house give much arms to the people and pray to God always coming up in the car I was talk to my wife telling them about how on the other side there will be some which say Jesus will tell them I was sick and never he to come and look for me and I was in prison you never visited me I was hungry never fed me he said when Lord he say as you have done it to the least of these ones you have done to me I say I tell my wife I say it's just pure wickedness when people in a position to help and they don't God sees at that and then people walk with the Bible in church but they're Wicked somebody hungry and your pass say because you don't want to help them and is a position to do that God see that as wickedness you see that money thing where the servant buried the money and the master went away this one half five he bring five this one 10 bring 10 this one have one he bury it he's so inspired when he Master come back he say look your one day one look it's safe and S you say you're Wicked man at least if you had put it in the bank to get interest it right now have 5% .1% almost no perc interest at least you get little thing on the banks are all Wicked I'm not going there but this man was devout listen he wasn't a Christian you know he wasn't belonging to the message of the hour in that day he was a gentile so that come like me people looking at a gentile man H and he doing better works just and loving his Saints yes and people inside of here loving nobody they loving I myself and me and my family help us Lord and this man praying that God he never met a god he don't know but he's not praying and just praying like a air prayer people playing air guitar just doing something I guess have air Christians they just air Christians is just making motions devil will just laugh at that you know he a testing that he said God told this man die prayers and D arms that's what he's given his contribution I come up for a memorial before God so you could do things on earth that influences and recognizes in heaven but Gideon preacher message the power of one let me add a little back to that the audience of one if we could live for the audience of for the audience of one God himself you're not pleas in family friends you're not pleas in school friends nobody you are pleasing the audience of one but give an illustration of a man who was doing some music piece and when he finished so everybody clapping and shouting and he moving because he watching a man up there he want to know what that man think because that is the man that taught him that is the man who's the master he's not interested in people who don't know F note from C note as far as they concern it's sing good and that's the problem in the message brother George people don't know F note from C note and they find the preacher sing good they know Genesis the Revelation they know nothing in the Bible but they like the man he could say anything to them but this man then he watching he watching the audience are one when that man was satisfied and he raised his hands he know he IM who are you pleasing Oh Glory to God do you recognize the audience of one God must be first your family second and you must come last oh give the Lord a shout he said give me a farmer give me a preacher give me a housewife give me any man that will put God first I will show you somebody that is successful despite whatever the devil put in front of them oh give the Lord I show we are free [Applause] today brother brand you are begotten of the spirit at sanctification I preach this I share this so much times I hope it come across different this time begotten is when the baby is being formed in the womb birth is when the baby come true so the formation of eyes and Limbs and whatever inside of that he says you are begotten at sanctification so what a punch if somebody not Sanctified what happening inside they be big bigboot you are begotten of the spirit at sanctification but never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes a baby got life in the womb of the mother little muscles are quivering it's a life but it's a different life when it breaths the breath of life into his noil he said my dear Methodist Brother P Holiness Nazarene the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification sanctification is the cleansing which is the preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparing or Preparation is the cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification means clean and set aside for service the Holy Spirit it puts it in service you are the vessel that God has cleaned up oh glory to God you must have a testimony God has not you stop smoking stop drinking you know God has clean me up oh give say Lord I shout you could stop doing this and stop doing that but when the work is done by God you have a testimony that gives glory to God and give a witness that he's the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever glory glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God so without sanctification you really not even the message because the blood not effective to you is a mind thought that believe what the God said and God s a prophet that a mind thing that a life thing and when you come into the message to reflect the message you have to have a blood show and the blood for the age is brotherly kindness which is totally absent wh you had to look you had to look that why you say when the chch find it because they lost it that is totally absent Breen crossing the street ducking one kind of thing forget it and D bride know that bride what that is quality tribulation Saint you hear what I said that is quality tribulation Saints they have a ticket to the tribulation it almost like a cruise there was the VIP rest of the Pentecost and the other mates people other people behind them and this is where I find such a powerful deception because you have to see what God requ requires the people see in Acts but Moses know his ways when there was complain about Moses wife what you think God come and tell them are you serious are you coming against a man that I talking to be serious God straightened them out Satan has an agenda and I'm realizing that H you know the prophet talk about the person of Christ yes sir and you can see people don't understand God have a personality God is Not abstract you know like you know God everywhere and you spitting your hands through he's not that you know amen he has feeling about things he has determination about things one time he was so upset he repent he made man but Noah found Grace in his sight if God didn't make man the Earth in in normal the Stars was normal it was good for good heaven good dinosaurs everything everybody good fish good everything running good he said oh gosh but there's nothing in my image and likeness let me make something in my image and likeness let us make man when he put man then outter man he p a woman devil see that good he see opportunity that he has somebody to work with God give them word eat of every tree the tree limits don't touch it because the day you eat that day you shall surely die ad I'm going to work Adam tilling soil devil come by Eve to ask Eve what God say because God not talking to Satan Satan get boots away from Heaven no chat no talk no no inspir then when she Express what God say she said You shall not surely die look at us today young people don't think they dying now Bible says know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God that you are not your own you were bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God's so in looking at Satan's character and the person of his being this anointed cherub Satan can never get back his position you know sometime if you know you can get back a position you could beg he gets sign off the pink slip he get out of Heaven he has no access to get back up there to get back to the position he had he got boots and he not going back so he has nothing to lose so his job is to corrupt the Tabernacles the temples the houses that God cannot get access and Liv in his job is to corrupt what is inside of you so that you cannot be acceptable to God and once you cannot be acceptable to God then Satan has won amen the value of your house do you know the value of your house all right all right all right if you don't it's time to get valuation don't sell yourself cheap time to do a valuation Satan's work is for the house to lose value by fornication adultery G ganja smoking lies corrupt it until God reject so Satan hates this thing called process the process of sanctification it cost to sanctify and we read it Jesus said I sanctify myself some of you give up nothing that why I tell young people long time if your mother and father don't deal with you life will cut your tail all way you get away with and you think you get through life will come and whip you because life have a way of balancing things off so Satan is at work he could be very patient he could wait you out because he have a specific agenda and that's why the prophet went and said What Hurts The Devil is to see a consecrated dedicated life Hallelujah that hurt that's the Thunder that shake the devil because as a life the devil can't touch he could only watch but he can't touch his job is to pervert the Tabernacle like you are the house that you are the temple that you are that God can't lose you that's why the prophet said if you can't live it then stop preaching it because the preacher suppos to live it and preach it too I've preach it often that you it easy to see the the outside sins Lord yes sir it easy to see the visible sins the bigger sins is the one that you can't see the sins of resentment bitterness unforgiveness the inner jails that people are in sin is bondage sin is what affects your worship to God your service to God and God hat sin we not talking about loving the sinner now we not talking about that part we talking about what God hates Matthew 12 vers 22 is the script before four then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him in so much as the Blind and dumb both spake and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of David and when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast out Devils but by Bel the prince of devils know they know the prince and Jesus knew that thought and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if I by B cast out Devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if I cast them out by the Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come upon [Music] you but these are the words he said closing or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first bind a strong man and he will spoil his house oh my Hallelujah so Jesus clearly identifies sat of a kingdom and S Satan have order in his kingdom he no fool not he not running no hey move so move so no no no he have structure he has a system he has an order do you have a order do you have a structure Matthew 12:43 45 says when the unclean spirit this the part I want to get to is gone out of a man he walth through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none so all these spirits that was kicked out of heaven they already don't belong here you know they're looking for bodies they're looking for houses so when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walk through Dry places seeking rest find it none he says I will return unto my house from whence I came out and when he has come he found it empty swept and garish somebody give a heart to the Lord and they come to church and the word wash them and the house clean the house empty the house garnish you have some furn in the house and that devil say oh like they clean up for me because that house supposed to get the filling of the Holy Ghost the cleansing is for you to get power the cleansing is for you get fire the cleansing is for you get the anointing that's what that is for you have to go all the way if it don't go all the way the devil see a empty house he's saying house for rent house a title for it house for what a house I forget house what yeah house foret my house foret that attract the devil know he said that want to let me in but this guy a a joker this demon in no joker here verse 45 then he go he he was once there he get the boots he's outside now when he come back and Peep in the house and say he's singing he's singing Amazing Grace now he's saying I know what I hear them singing oh I knew it was the blood then he go and take with him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they Enter he he Comey this time so I want to tell you the devil giving up them Keys them house keys easy Hallelujah question who own your house oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah who own your house and who is controlling your house just read again he go he take with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be unto this wicked generation call it's a wicked generation Oh Glory to God your father talk to you your mother talk to you this one talk to you you don't want to hear a rebellious Spirit come upon you it are more coming them fellas have gangs them fellas in py them fellas have have help and support and when

mark who desire those things not God nothing but modesty nothing Sanctified about that hallu who owns your house who controls your house who is influencing your house you in church but who owns your house when the Bible said you are the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost every sin commit outside the body those that within fornication within why because that connects to sexual immorality sexual impurity and that's what the devil want to destroy you inside out that God will reject you because after a while God reject that now I know people don't like to hear about Sin they want to hear about too blessed to be stressed they want to hear about all the promises in the book is minds they don't want to hear about the possessed in her the land every place to put is your yeah how you get foot across

the Jos by faith watch Paul in next verse for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness the Amplified for God's holy wrath and indignation are revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men now Satan knows this so Satan knows if he could pull you into unrighteousness pull you into ungodliness rat coming for you it have these systems now these technological systems like apply for something and it rejects you is not a human doing that you know the system gets the information I think even now I think even to apply for the US Visa to know if you could come into the interview the systems will actually ident it's not a human checkin and going through that you know the system working automatically it will give you a a a tick to say will come for interview or not or whatever it is it will do that well God's nature he can't help it he has to respond a certain way do you understand that it's not that God it's not that God sh and loved them God get a fight no his word demands he keeps it so he told Adam the day you eat that day you die in other words the system or the law is already in place to affect death if you touch that and I can't change it for God's holy wrath and indignation are revealed from Heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who in their wickedness repress and hinder the the truth and make it inoperative enablers and complicit persons becomes enemy of God Amen how could you become an enemy of God James 4 says he adulterers and adulter say know you not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God James 4 the amplifi says you are like Unfaithful wives having illicit love affairs with the world and breaking your marriage vow to God do you not know that being the world's friend is being God's enemy so whosoever chooses to be a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God the Bible say God has resist the proud is not proud outside it's proud right inside the church but there a demon that's a spirit to you know that's the original spirit that Satan got caught up with pride I will be like the most high I will be like God he exalt himself you have to be able to walk humble you have to walk to humble yourself put a mark upon those who are not enablers or complicit with sin God will not put a mark upon those who are enablers Hebrews 12:5 says and you have not and this is a verse we are touched before you are and and he have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as as children children my son despise not the chasen of the Lord or faint when th rebuke for him that's for children that not for God not rebuking any Sinners outside you know the Sinners need to come to get saved but the sons in the churches who get rebuked the sons and churches who get corrected the Sinners don't sin you know they they are sinners is the people in ch that sin if you in your chasten God deal with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not the Amplified for the Lord corrects and discipline everyone whom he loves and he punishes even scores I didn't check the meaning of the word scores but I think there's plenty licks on your back every son whom he accepts and welcomes to his heart and cherishes you must submit to and endure correction for discipline so therefore we running a mark because we doing our own thing your mother get away father get away you get away you loose and you come to the Lord and his hand come upon you now yes you must submit to and endure correction for discipline God is dealing with you as with sons for what son is there whom his father does not train and correct a discipline they come like you don't want to correct your son or daughter because you don't want to them to feel bad but the problem with that is this later on in life they will make you feel bad do you get that your daughter or son misbehaving in public and instead of you straighten them out and get them on the right footing and they go cry and cry and know put up a show and let them put up the show but you let it go and afterwards that little thing gr up in one big monster later on they going to embarrass you in public so it's better you straighten them out now sometime ago we say it's better you work with a young child than to try to correct a Broken Man deal with your son when he is Young than when he's broken so sin must be confessed and forsaken you can take some more I am loaded you know I'm now going to page nine and we have 20 pages yes so buckling your seat we going anywhere still in Trinidad you're home no more than less than two hours away so you're safe all right Bible says now no chastening for the present seem it to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby now Romans 1 and I think this is a powerful one Romans 1: 24 it says wherefore God give them up to uncleanness through their lust of their own Hearts note it's inside of the people it's inside of people lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into aive verse 25 and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever and amen for this cause God give them up unto vile affection even their woman did change their natural use in the that which is against nature likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burning their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all here we go unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit maginity Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful hallah that's the whole hug that's everything inside of there verse 32 there's the part who knowing the Judgment of God so this is not people on the outside who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of dead not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do that in other words they are complicit with others who are doing those things Romans 1:22 in the Amplified said though they are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die they not only do them themselves but approve and applaud others who practice them let's continue Brown Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience it is the Holy Ghost it is not an organization you couldn't organize the Holy Ghost he wouldn't stand for it you are not even converted till you get the Holy Ghost that is what the scriptures said Jesus told Peter ask anyone read your scriptures he was justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus becoming a follower an apostle Jesus G him the keys to the kingdom St John 17:17 he Sanctified them with power and send them out to cast out devils and sanctify them and sanctify them Father to thy truth he said I sanctify myself because of them Jesus said these words I sanctify myself because of them he said that's one of the sweetest words that I ever heard father I sanctify myself for de sake do you know here we go do you know he had a right to have a home he was a human do you know he had a right to have a wife he was a man he had a right to have all these things he said father I sanctify if y myself for their sake I sanctify myself Jesus was training 12 men those 12 men has to was to take the gospel to the world and he said for their sake I sanctify myself and then he said these words make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else sake that's the problem we live too little too small because we are selfish and when you live selfish lives you don't have no motivation to really support and help others am me and I we learn over the years you could never help others you can help yourself when you bless others you see blessing come back yourself you support others you support come back yourself you're not looking for support you're not looking for blessing you're just doing the right thing doing what needs to be done that's why I say how could you see somebody hungry and to help them and feed them somebody without clothes and you wouldn't want to give them clothes and you can afford to amen is wickedness God seizes as such watch this get this get this if you meet your enem okay let let's read it again make yourself for your neighbor's sake are we hearing this for somebody else sake don't use your Liberty for a cloak Paul said but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication it come like he people don't passing people straight when say good morning and what you know what know what that come from when somebody said do talk to this one do talk to that one long time everybody I pass morning hello hi school children sometime I do like a like I like this in India I learn this thing Let's do let's do it too sometime some let me cross I do like this CH man like this I just say thank you I I dou my own self thanks good morning you come inside the church say good morning hello hi you walking past straight like a bus where is a business Place stay with that foolishness you know we we could do without that you know I am saying it out see if a mother tell her daughter don't talk this one don't talk that one and she passing paper straight when she come here to church she's doing same to you passing you straight like a bus because was quoted in I am mixing matters I am mixing words are too old now see and defend different at least I could tell truth hear this if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself okay okay so God tell the prophet be more sincere you have been given power to bind the M now listen he didn't tell him if he be sincere he get the power he said you have been given power be more sincere but the M couldn't affect him the M was going after Brethren so his sincerity and he going and fast and pray to get more sincere understand this God tell him be more sincere nobody else in the world could tell the prophet be more sincere nobody could see that the saying as a prophet but when God looked down God see stuff inside of there that have to get thrown out and we have to understand is not what we think not what we feel is what God sees and when he went and sanctify himself and fast three days he was binding the mama to protect Brethren from being affected by that thing that when it hit you it kill you some of you will get killed if you don't come under protection because this here in this church is not the battle I some of you think that but not the B so please don't get fight with me do get fight with me because the battle is not me I I look like Lucifer I have any resemblance to what Lucy looking like you are here to get equipped you are here to get empowered you are here because your battle is about to start [Music] H I won't want to worry you out but I have some things here that I really the placing of a son the first thing after the son was in he become a son then we find out we find here we go his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behaved right or not note not his sermon not his message not his jacket not his shoes not the what he wear his behavior not his podcast this is God thoughts in matter not a preaching for 4 hours and it's mystery after mystery and you have the head your head SP Jes Behavior you mean after all this gospel after all this word after all this Bible after all this teaching it come down to behavior yes [Applause] we find out his behavior is what setting to adoption whether he behave right or not a minister come to the pit and say I'm adopted like a fool and people believe that foolishness he adopted because his mouth say so sometime they get others people to you know he want to see when Jesus was adopted a voice thundered this is my beloved Son hearing him God is ashame of his son to say I approved his son so no real son adopted have to say you know say want to say it you know but I you know that um Cho so he nothing he he wasting time he's just idle and he have no message and he want you to to believe him just just like that say it will speak for itself so his behavior right not his gift not his talent not his ability his teaching gift no Pastor gift Apostle gift length of time in the ministry his behavior this man 40 people 40 50 years and then fail the come for wife all right but R say what worries me is to take people and preach to them this God send truth and they turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing and say to God the holy ghost that ruins you we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us we should be so sweet excuse me we should be so sweet you got to get honey for that the hell s sell honey some people literally get honey and that wouldn't make it sweet the perfume of forgiveness a clean heart that can make you sweet amen you talk about sanctification in the westan church in West time sanctification time they were so Sanctified that the Holy Ghost come upon them come upon the Believers and they had a bucket of water deacons them they was Deon with buckets of water that was service have a bucket of water and waiting when the Holy Ghost hit them so you water them to wake them up can't let them break into the Holy Ghost just yet Sanic attracts the Holy Ghost he said we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us we should be so sweet so pleasant so kind so Christlike in our lives it takes a everyday life we you notice wow that sins a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sin the church is who does wrong gets a wrong thought wrong impression make Scruples wobble up like a child trying to learn how to walk the church does that so praise God let me skip I going on all right so he was 8 now we on 13 see I skip down so but Brown notice Jesus says sanctify them Father by thy truth Thy word is truth after they were Sanctified he asked them to T in the city of Jerusalem Luke 24:49 until they were endured from on high am in other words they were Sanctified then uper room he said the devil don't okay how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you jump how much you can do this that and Shout What Hurts The Devil is to see a Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be move right on that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil if he could preach like Billy Graham devil laugh at that he said sometime the devil just laugh at that he don't he don't pay more attention to that like nothing he said you could have all the theology all the Seminary training the devil just sit back and laugh but when he sees that lifeall oh praise the name of the Lord praise God do you believe that second Timothy 2 19 to 21 nevertheless the foundation of the Lord standeth sure having the seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Jesus Christ depart from iniquity and iniquity is when you know to do right and doing wrong you know it's iniquity that's iniquity from inside your heart you have to ask God take that out of me cleanse that from inside of me you have to do it now you have to do it today praise God you don't want to trim your tree of sin because all the leaves will go back we want to get it at the very Roots do you hear that God has not called for the pruning of the tree of sin but in a great house here we go there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and of Earth some to honor some to dishonor if a man bride are you getting me if a man therefore Purge himself the pastor to purge you if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor so you cannot go by your predestination you cannot go because God elected you you cannot go because you believe the prophet and you believe Malachi 4 and you have a book and all he said all as with me shall be with me don't go by that amen amen P yourself is not an automatic thing you see how far off the mark people are talking about that their bride they going nowh if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified meat for the Master's use prepared for every work praise the name of the Lord Bible talk about water blood and spirit these trees agree in one what that means you could be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost oh praise the name of the Lord praise God hallelujah praise God are you seeing it now so that devil come into the message with Baptist Doctrine when you believe it you have it I'm on home Str now page 15 that mean we have five more page P 20 Ezekiel 18:4 says behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinth it shall die God said All Souls are mine Ezekiel 18:20 the soul that sinth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him pray praise God so God sees what he sees God cannot stand on clean that is why he lives under Holiness that is why when the fire hit Isaiah he B wo is me I'm a man of undone I'm a man of unclean lips because God is Holy he's not the Prime Minister he's not the president he's not the teacher or the principal of the school he is God so unclean is the opposite of Holiness I want this one this one was quite striking Genesis 4 Adam knew his wife of time he had can and Abel we know verse three of Genesis 4 in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord verse four of Genesis 4 and he also brought Abel brought the first one of his flock and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering so the boys are no longer boys they're men now and God I want you to worship me one bought plants fruits whatever or one what blood from the first of the flock unto Cain and his offering he had not respect remember I just told you God have his thoughts about respects this is how it demonstrated here Cain was very rough very angry his countenance fell so it was showing he wasn't like you know I mean smiling normal normal he he was falling count hear this now verse six and the Lord said unto King why at thou R why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shall not thou be accepted if thou doest not well here we go sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him so God is almost come like God War King King King if if you're doing wrong S at the door you know you don't have to let them get you you don't have to let them bite you near you it's right by your door look at the next verse and Cain talked with his Able's brother came to pass when they were in the field Kain rose up against his brother and slew him God just talk to the man and say sin lying at the door friends sin does move you know sin do snatch people you know and sin could be lying right at your door and the Lord s to King where is brother he said I am I know not am I My Brother's Keeper this dust man talking to the god of Heaven that he don't know he just G but this is the cap one that I want to get to Esther chapter 2 we want to read from verse one Vash with his show feminine rights she want to go to she husband and she playing the fool reading all them feminine magazine all them wom power thing the king had enough of that they say if we let her get away that every wife in the Kingdom go start to act just like vashi get rid of that woman and Esther chapter 2 begins and and these things when the wrath of King Asar was appeased remember vashi what she had done and was decreed against her then said the king servants that minister to him let there be feir young virgins sought for the king so they try to get new women young virgins let the king appoint officers skip down to verse four let the maiden which pleases the king be Queen instead of Vash and the thing pleased the king and he did so my God hallelujah all right and there's okay verse five was morai the Jew all right let's skip down now so Mori right verse seven and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother so this was a caring man and the maid was fair and beautiful whom Mori when her father and mother was dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard that many maidens were gathered together into shushan the palace to the custody of Hagi that Esther was brought also to the King's house to the custody of hegi Keeper of the woman and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily give her things for purification is the part I want to get so in other words it wasn't like if the king put away vashti and you pretty girls are around oh she looking pretty look pretty one coming no the ton of them was pretty but now they had to go through process you know how long the process was was 12 months 12 months before selection process let's go and the Maiden pleased him verse 9 and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily give her the things for purification which such things as belong to her seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the's house and he preferred her and a maid unto the best places of the House of women Esther had not shown a people for her Kindred nor modai had charged her that she should not show it and morai walked every day before the court of the woman's house to know how Esther did he himself couldn't go in but there was somebody in charge of the woman and he would inquire of Esther verse 12 this is the part we going to get to and when every maid's turn was come to go into king hasus after she had been 12 months this is where I get it here from According to the manner of woman for so were the days of the purification accomplished to with six months with oil of M and six months with sweet orders with other things for the purifying of the woman so I am saying it have a ton of soal bride or church call them woman but there's a process that when you come through this process you're supposed to be smelling good because you see have to see Jesus you have to begin to see Christ we too far down the road to see you so this want to get that so Esther was taking on The King House in his house Royal in the 10th month which is the month of tith in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the wom and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen is vashi so I want to challenge you is it you going to a fight or you're reluctant to obey God what is your fight your F be me is it that you are going through a fight and people no going through and the pressure and the pressure and whatnot are you fighting up with yourself or are you really resisting to obey God consecration I have this here consecration for transation I'm going to close Mission come please 1 Thessalonians 43-5 says for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor so in other words you as a young sister should be interested how you supposed to be reflecting on your job how you supposed to be acting you're in a job with worldly people everybody they have the earring and the lipstick and everything else and the makeup and everybody who but you have to stand out different if you IR them look at what they have they pulling you in to their thing instead of you attract them into your thing because you don't know the value of your house it's time you valuation God sees you as his house and you can't put a value to God's house because God want to step into your shoes step into your dress step and put on your tie he wants to step inside your shoes for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that everyone of you should know how to Poss possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in lusp of cence even was a gentile which know not God the PS 37 says he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of men it's so unfortunate that when Moses came and BR the people to the mountain and he went up the mountain to seek God and while he's getting the Ten Commandments they ordering Aon to make golden Cal and some body find it was a brilliant idea bring your goal let's melt it and make a cal and they said this is be our God that brought us out of Egypt the god of heaven looking down at this foolishness that these bunch of people that come out of pharaoh saw all his acts but they don't know him Moses G for the word for the to get a concept of this God how he operates how he lives his nature his being all about him am at the end of it all we supposed to know all about about him not because a prophet say and Shar this know but because of the experiences that God has helped us and take us through in our own lives that we could know who this God is Colossians 1 says for this cause since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God

steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God with Fuller deeper clearer Insight acquaintance and recogn since you're supposed to see growth in your own life I beseech you Brethren by

mercies and bring us back at the appointed time in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen you may be seated so before I get to the announcements just for a few minutes last week Sunday we would have announced that we wanted to speak to the parents of the Sunday school and brother and I spoke so we I'm just going to do it to the general Church um dedicated to the parents of course and to the Sunday school program in general but certainly to put on record a few things that we want to get on the same page on uh for a few minutes before we get into the announcements so two Sundays ago uh had a meeting with the Sunday school team how many appreciate the Sunday school team and it is a sacrifice and I was sharing with them that the same way that a minister just can come to the pulpit and wing it it's the same way that we have to take a duty of care and responsibility to how we approach the Sunday school and the ministry and the responsibility of it and in having a conversation with the entire team we thought it fit and important to also have a conversation with the parents because it's two sides of the equation to make this work is for the same reason within the natural school system there's a PTA or parent Teachers Association where there are conversations between what parents are responsible for and what the teachers are responsible for so we went into a few things including clearly having a conversation and defining what our children must know before they move to the next stage in the program of the Sunday School Etc and ensuring that our children are equipped fully because the attack is intensifying and you can't be winging it in 2024 and Beyond you have to know what ground you're standing on you have to know what is the scriptural support for what we stand for what does the message say about certain things so we want to be very precise through every stage of the Sunday school and ult ultimately map out what graduation looks like throughout every stage of the Sunday school and into um the youth ministry as well and I shared a few scriptures with the Sunday School teachers and I want to share it with the entire church as well and these are scriptures that guide what we do but there are scriptures that you know even in line with what with preach this morning it it kepts it helps guard us and protect us and gives us a context within which we could firmly operate many of these scriptures we are familiar with I'm not going to read all that would I would have shared with them but certainly the objective of this is to ensure that the parents understand that they have a part to play in this thing I've always made the point that you know in the natural school system a parent could take the position at the the when a child goes to school that the teacher is responsible for the education of the child but the children who do well in school are the ones where the parents are involved in the process when they come home you ask them what's the homework you make sure it gets done Etc and there is this this issue of responsibility and blame that takes a position that well it's the Sunday school supposed to do it or the school teacher supposed to do it and the parents kind of pull themselves back many of times and statistically when we look at how the children perform form both in natural and in the Sunday School the children that shine are the ones where there's more support at home so Proverbs 226 familiar scripture train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it this is the scripture that everyone should hold there to their hearts but as parents and as a church in general relook at this scripture there's an element of work in the process of training we talked about process BR Peach about process this morning so that training is not YouTube training it's not go Ando IT training it's an active participation in the process of training up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and by virtue of the Sunday school program the teachers are committed to Preparing the courses the programs the training to help with this but the parents have a role to play in it as well Deuteronomy 6: 6-7 and these words which I command this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children so this is not just teaching to the children and I want us to understand that when you see children begin to go astray it is because the concern the Bel the care the knowledge because as simple as it is my daughter is in primary school now and she's coming back to me with Daddy they said this or they said this and and and she's questioning do we believe this and 5 years old and I'm and I'm saying if the questions are asked and the correct answers that presented in a year in two in three in five in 10 years we have a problem so the Bible says here in Deuteronomy 6:6 and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk to them when thou sest in thine house so this is not Sunday school we're talking about now we're talking about the conversations that take place inside of the home and if we don't take take the care in our homes to have the right conversations to ask the questions there are questions I ask my daughter when she comes home from school how was your day did anybody talk to you did anything happen let me know because I want to have the right conversations but here it is and I want to kneel this down just two or three scriptures to give a context of that balance between what we expect our children to come to church to learn and the work that takes place every single day of the week because they're here for one day two days or a week that's it but 7 days a week 5 days they in school they're getting hours and hours of communication in the school words from the teachers and the teachers are anointed and inspired yes and if we let the teachers in the natural school system just talk to them for six seven hours or whatever and share seeds to them they're going to come back every day and we have to go and dissect and impact and these are the things that cause issues so I want us to be very sensitive of the responsibility this is not saying the ministry do have a responsibility and the school have a responsibility but as parents what level of care and I'm repeating the word and these words which I command the I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk to them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way so you're going down the road you're driving in the car you whatever you do but but it's part of your conversation the conversation cannot always be the politics and the news and the media and the gossip but these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart so if it's not even in your parents' heart how could it be in your children's heart are you with me this morning so This Is Us calibrating and aligning because we want to create a situation where when they come to the Sunday school they're able to follow up on the last lesson they're excited because this has to be the excitement the excitement must be that you're not from here you you you want to go to heaven you want to make it to Eternity and and these are the principles here so these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk to them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up you see how much aspects it is so I want you this is your homework this evening parents and children Deuteronomy 6 ver 6- 7 2 Timothy 3:15 and that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus so Paul in his conversation to Timothy is saying and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures so we have a responsibility to take this parenting thing more seriously they are those who have gone out of our care they have grown old Ronaldo celebrating 18 years he's an adult so now he have to accept full responsibility sister Katy half of her responsibility done now he's a big man so he now have to hunt in the word for his stand but for those who are not adults who are under the care of homes and under the care of parents there's a great responsibility upon us to ensure that our children know the holy scriptures and they understand the message and they know what we believe can the church say Amen Psalms 11 1911 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee I will stop with that for now and our Sunday school program officially starts for the year 2024 2025 next Sunday um the parents you should have all already received communication but for the church in general Sunday school officially starts next week Lord willing and our Sunday school program runs every term we should have a graduation ceremony as they move from stage to Stage we're excited to support them and most importantly you need to come on time it makes no sense that we are putting the resources in for Sunday school and you comeing in when you want to come in we are holding the teachers responsible for preparing the resources to teach them effectively and the very least you could do is ensure that they come on time so they could benefit from the teaching can the church say Amen this also helps you to come in time to also pray up for the service so they should be part and parcel of while they are in the Sunday School you praying for them because as bov said the devil has an agenda he wants to knock them out one by one he want to find a way to make the house lose value and we are here to make sure the house has value every service we come we want to add a paint we want to add something we want to add word upon word line upon line precept upon precept until your house becomes so valuable the devil say I can't afford this thing because it already been paid for it paid for with a price can the church say Amen so may the Lord richly bless you Sunday school team we love you we appreciate you you have our support do let us know for the repeat you know you know sometimes you there's why there's a reason that in the workplace there's a line in the book when people reach late and they signing registers and because if these things didn't exist the system that exist would fall so Sunday school I'm officially putting a let us know who coming late and missing the whole class all the time and going be last two minutes so we could have the conversation just like the schools would do because we really want the children to benefit and we want at the end of the term they know something that they could stand up and say I learned this I learn this scripture I learn this quote and know this story understand how this connected and they are in a position to stand can the Church Say Amen wonderful so now let me get to the announcement can we give a hands clap one more time for the Sunday school team as well as for the [Applause] students so the Deacon just reminded me the Sunday School official start
