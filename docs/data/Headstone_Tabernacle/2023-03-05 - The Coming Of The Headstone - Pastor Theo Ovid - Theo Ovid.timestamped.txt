[34:56] today may your bless the word that'll be
[34:57] read and may you be magnified and
[34:59] glorified no myths
[35:01] reason I ask
[35:02] it amen before we read the scriptures as
[35:05] Daniel heard the seven Thunders and
[35:06] forbidden John heard the voices and this
[35:09] book was sealed and the back was seen
[35:11] with Seven Seals but in the days of DC
[35:14] used to be open the mystery of God shall
[35:16] be finished in other words God will be
[35:18] known to his church not in three people
[35:20] but as one person
[35:22] the mystery of God will be revealed and
[35:24] when that was completely revealed then
[35:27] the seven Mysteries were opened to the
[35:29] church because India the church would be
[35:33] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[35:37] Spirit him moving in and out showing his
[35:41] signs of being alive among us living
[35:43] among us and then we are worshiping the
[35:46] living Christ that's Among Us what a
[35:49] promise the living Christ
[35:51] moving in and out like he moving this
[35:53] morning he can move in this evening
[35:54] moving in and out then you're worshiping
[35:56] the living Christ then you know you're
[35:58] coming into the presence of the Living
[35:59] God not a man God in the midst of the
[36:02] people
[36:03] so this evening two portions of
[36:04] scripture you want to read
[36:06] praise the Lord uh one from Daniel
[36:09] chapter Two I want to read 25-45 and
[36:12] first Thessalonians 4 15 to 18. this is
[36:16] Daniel we're only from verse 35 this is
[36:19] after the king got the dream couldn't
[36:21] remember the dream is All Shook Up and
[36:23] he called his wise men and suit tears
[36:25] and wizards and witches to tell him what
[36:27] the dream was
[36:30] I can't remember it
[36:33] they say well we have to get to know the
[36:34] dream he said well they can't tell me
[36:36] that dream and tell me the information
[36:37] I'll cut all the head off
[36:38] I only have gift for they playing holy
[36:40] spiritual depending on any remedy Spirit
[36:42] you better tell me the dream because
[36:44] forget a dream then somebody says
[36:46] dictate remember Danielle and Daniel
[36:48] went and sought the Lord and God gave
[36:49] Daniel exactly the dream and the
[36:51] interpretation so this is the last part
[36:54] of it verse 35 then was the iron the
[36:56] clay the brass the silver the gold
[36:58] broken the pieces together became like
[37:00] the shaft of the summer trashing floors
[37:02] and the wind carried him away and no
[37:04] place was found for them and the stone
[37:06] that smoothie image became a great
[37:08] mountain and filled the whole head
[37:11] look look how positive this is this is
[37:13] the dream
[37:14] and we will tell the interpretation
[37:16] thereof before the king dawah king at
[37:19] the King of Kings for the god of Heaven
[37:21] had given the a kingdom power strength
[37:24] and glory and where server the children
[37:26] of men dwell the Beast of the field the
[37:28] Falls of the heaven that he given unto
[37:29] them hand and hat made the ruler over
[37:31] them all dawat this head of gold after
[37:35] the shall arise under the kingdom in
[37:36] fear it is he not the third Kingdom of
[37:38] brass which shall be a rule over all the
[37:41] Earth the the fourth Kingdom shall be
[37:43] strong as iron for as much as iron break
[37:45] it in pieces and subduate all things and
[37:48] as and that breakth all these shall it
[37:50] break in pieces and Brews whereas thou
[37:53] sowest defeat and tools part of Potter's
[37:55] clay part of iron the kingdom shall be
[37:57] divided but there shall be in it of
[37:59] strength of the and for as much as
[38:01] though see us the iron mixed with Maori
[38:03] clay and as the toes of the feet were
[38:05] part iron part of clay so the kingdom
[38:07] shall be practiced strong
[38:13] themselves with the seed of men they
[38:15] shall not cleave one to another is not
[38:18] mixed with clay and in the days of these
[38:20] Kings
[38:21] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[38:24] which shall never be destroyed
[38:26] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[38:28] another people but they shall break in
[38:30] pieces and consume all these kingdoms it
[38:33] shall stand forever for as much as those
[38:35] sowest that the stone was cut out of the
[38:38] mountain without the hands that is
[38:40] breaking pieces the iron the brass to
[38:42] Clay the silver the gold the great God
[38:44] had made known to the king what shall
[38:47] come to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[38:49] sitting and the interpretation sure
[38:52] first Thessalonians 4 reading from verse
[38:55] 15. for this we see unto you by the word
[38:57] of the Lord that we which Our Lives
[38:59] remains unto the coming of the Lord
[39:00] shall not prevent them which I sleep for
[39:03] the Lord himself shall descend from
[39:05] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[39:07] the Archangel with the Trump of God and
[39:09] the dead in Christ shall rise Fist and
[39:11] we which Our Lives remain shall be
[39:13] caught up together with them in the
[39:14] clouds to meet the Lord in the ear so
[39:16] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore

[57:11] in your life when everybody has dry you
[57:13] wet wet wet wet David said my cup run it
[57:17] over Oh Glory to God they call an oil of
[57:20] the Holy Ghost coming down to your beard
[57:22] coming down to you damn it God already
[57:24] oh give the Lord some Praises your oil
[57:27] down all over or give the Lord some
[57:29] Praises God could restore your joy God
[57:32] can restore your peace God can restore
[57:34] your Christian walk Walker restore your
[57:36] prayer life through the devil's a liar
[57:38] you've got to get back to prayer life
[57:40] you have to take it back
[57:46] all right
[57:48] now watch now remember
[57:50] appearing and coming is two different
[57:52] words
[57:53] to appear and then to come now is the
[57:56] appearance he appears in his last days
[57:58] right here with us in the last few years
[58:00] no it's a sign of his coming
[58:05] wait a minute he has to appear among us
[58:07] before he come
[58:09] yes an appearance is a sign of this
[58:12] coming
[58:13] here you see it again that was in term
[58:14] evangelism this is Jehovah Jireh he says
[58:16] the appearing of Christ and then the
[58:18] coming of Christ that is two different
[58:21] things altogether the appearing and the
[58:23] coming he's appearing now working with
[58:26] us in the form of the Holy Spirit making
[58:29] it just perfect the church it has to be
[58:31] they told the Americans see they say
[58:33] watch The Pyramid as it shapes up the
[58:35] church justification sanitation but the
[58:38] Holy Spirit then it's got to be honed
[58:40] Out The Headstone never did come to the
[58:42] pyramid it was rejected just like the
[58:44] Cornerstone but when The Headstone comes
[58:47] I have been to the pyramid to publish it
[58:49] when Christ come to receive his church
[58:52] so Christ has to come to receive the
[58:54] church watch the church will have the
[58:58] ministry just exactly like that and
[59:02] through that Grace will raise the whole
[59:04] thing then go
[59:05] the coming of The Headstone still
[59:07] reading Crying Chris Grace unto it not
[59:10] legalism Grace
[59:12] that's why he said the powers to come
[59:14] Among Us it will be the grace of God
[59:16] not even the prayer of the people
[59:18] the Gentile Church in the loudest and
[59:20] age if the Jews are in their Homeland
[59:22] already there the Gentile apostasy has
[59:24] taken place we have a present like we
[59:26] have we have a nation broke up like we
[59:28] have we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[59:30] hangers we have a church that's Luke one
[59:32] all that set in order
[59:34] we have a church of people that pull
[59:36] themselves together
[59:38] as you know
[59:40] you have to pull it together
[59:42] you had to watch yourself anymore and
[59:43] say this is enough this choppiness and
[59:45] the school you just gotta continue you
[59:46] gotta pull it together your car just
[59:48] continue like that
[59:51] and insanities when you're digging the
[59:53] same hole they expecting a different
[59:54] result
[59:55] how long are they getting there
[59:58] something at least partner
[1:00:02] get nothing
[1:00:04] foreign
[1:00:49] and trust God for the Sun and trust God
[1:00:53] for the right anointing to raise your
[1:00:55] crap oh get the Lord a shout but they
[1:00:58] feel lazy lie down on your bed
[1:01:01] you will get hungry
[1:01:04] Hallelujah be careful
[1:01:06] watch we have our ministry patterns the
[1:01:08] ministry of Jesus Christ to catch the
[1:01:11] stone when he comes
[1:01:13] so only the Holy Ghost Ministry could
[1:01:16] catch the stone
[1:01:17] so it's not just what we're in church we
[1:01:19] clap and we sing and no we have to get
[1:01:21] another place we have to get into a
[1:01:24] position where Christ can come oh my and
[1:01:28] I'm going to summarize this I want to
[1:01:29] wrap up here
[1:01:30] um we know this but I want to talk about
[1:01:32] when somebody gets married in those
[1:01:34] times it wasn't a ring it was a band
[1:01:36] over the head everyone was caught in
[1:01:38] adultery they will take her to the
[1:01:39] temple take out that certain ring that
[1:01:40] represents faithfulness and when a
[1:01:42] husband come home and see her without
[1:01:43] that he knows something went wrong and
[1:01:45] divorce and put away and this woman lost
[1:01:47] her coin has been coming she knows he
[1:01:49] has been final with all that coin she
[1:01:51] get put away all right after 40 years in
[1:01:53] the message get put away she don't want
[1:01:55] that so she started to look for this
[1:01:56] coin you know some people when they when
[1:01:58] they Place Duty and the other clean and
[1:02:00] that kind of special video on reaching
[1:02:01] them cleaning so this one was different
[1:02:03] she was so desperate that that it does
[1:02:05] not fly into the window the neighborhood
[1:02:14] you know because she's sweeping the
[1:02:16] cupboard she cutting the thing she
[1:02:18] flicking out thing you know Christmas

[1:02:26] that was lost oh glory to God she struck
[1:02:30] the floors she
[1:02:31] caught them she kept on until she found
[1:02:34] what she had lost and when she found it
[1:02:36] she called to other sister churches come

[1:02:53] gossiping saying what they want to say
[1:02:55] but the coin but I'm talking about every
[1:02:57] age have to display the blood on the
[1:02:58] chest and our blood is brotherly
[1:03:00] kindness it has to be displayed not talk

[1:08:11] until she found what she had lost and
[1:08:13] when she did she called her little
[1:08:14] sister churches to come now and I don't
[1:08:16] care if you're a Methodist Baptist
[1:08:18] Pentecostal Presbyterian let's rejoice
[1:08:20] when that time come
[1:08:23] prophecy when that time comes when the
[1:08:27] church that is bright church
[1:08:29] when the church finds his brotherly love
[1:08:32] when the church Finds Its holy decency

[1:08:36] Christ it will call to the other members
[1:08:38] of the body come and rejoice with us God
[1:08:41] wants the church to love him
[1:08:43] and this quotation is on a message
[1:08:45] called the second comes the Lord and the
[1:08:47] first Vision I ever saw that was in
[1:08:49] Cairo in prayer and a screen dropped
[1:08:51] down and I saw the second come of the
[1:08:53] Lord and that is how I went into this
[1:08:54] message by Vision I want to connected
[1:08:57] with this particular scripture I said
[1:08:59] church this have to be revealed
[1:09:01] brotherly love and God revealed it 1981.
[1:09:03] and the spirit poured out after that I
[1:09:05] remember I remember saying God wanted to
[1:09:08] see the whole thing this is my
[1:09:09] inspiration
[1:09:10] but where is the brotherly kindness
[1:09:13] God wants to seal it but when you're
[1:09:14] looking for it
[1:09:15] looking for honey
[1:09:17] does stick it look like it wouldn't
[1:09:19] stick it will stick
[1:09:21] it will stick
[1:09:22] as soon as Bradley kind of start to
[1:09:24] emanate watch the fire of God begin to
[1:09:27] move in the church well what's the power
[1:09:29] of God begin to move there are things in
[1:09:31] your heart you need to get out
[1:09:33] rock it wouldn't grow you have to bust
[1:09:37] all them rocks Let the Fire of God come
[1:09:39] and break all them stone and rock in
[1:09:42] your system
[1:09:43] blow it out Hallelujah until you get
[1:09:45] good soil good ground then you put the
[1:09:48] seed inside the deer all right I'm gonna
[1:09:51] close there's two more courses up
[1:09:55] did you notice right now the last hour
[1:09:57] when we bought the last great conference
[1:09:59] where crucial with five nations of the
[1:10:01] East
[1:10:03] Eisenhower the leader five nation of the
[1:10:05] West represented
[1:10:06] remember the image had five toes
[1:10:09] so he's typing it inside of here
[1:10:11] and the ten toes of the image they would
[1:10:13] not mix Khrushchev took off his shoes
[1:10:15] and beat it
[1:10:17] on the table
[1:10:19] spiritual mind will pick up right quick
[1:10:20] on the desk they will not next
[1:10:22] thing is the coming of the stone that is
[1:10:26] shoot out the monkey without hands that
[1:10:29] will roll into the Gentile Kingdom it
[1:10:31] will be finished
[1:10:33] just before that time
[1:10:35] he is going to send this Angel to what
[1:10:38] church to Saddam no to the lukewarm no
[1:10:41] he sent it to the elected callal Church
[1:10:45] what kind of sign did he show the same
[1:10:48] thing he did last night Elohim
[1:10:51] manifested in the person of the Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost in his church
[1:10:56] you say why ought to send us Millions
[1:10:59] miles in the sky with shouting places
[1:11:03] instead elwin come down in this age and
[1:11:06] speak Living Word I will return as a d
[1:11:08] I'll call us the time of life God took
[1:11:09] brother Branham he didn't take the angel
[1:11:11] the angel is watching over the prophecy
[1:11:14] that's why I said the angel of the Lord
[1:11:15] is on earth now fixing things are wrong
[1:11:17] for his coming final quote hallelujah
[1:11:21] praise God oh yeah
[1:11:23] we'll see watch this now we grow from
[1:11:25] Lutheran age Baptist age Methodist age
[1:11:27] Pentecostal age we are right up to the
[1:11:29] captain Stone now
[1:11:30] waiting longing for that Captain Stone
[1:11:34] to sit down
[1:11:36] watch now we are living in last days
[1:11:38] here we go the top of the pyramid the
[1:11:42] cross fishes or the cancer age in the
[1:11:44] zodiac in the time of the coming of a
[1:11:47] leader lion in the captain Stone and in
[1:11:50] the days of the manifestation of the
[1:11:52] sons of God in the Bible
[1:11:54] so he is saying we're in the captain
[1:11:57] and we are also in the lyric lion and
[1:12:00] also win a season of the manifestation
[1:12:01] of sons of God it has to come together
[1:12:03] the car closes down because we have
[1:12:05] books
[1:12:06] the car closes down because we
[1:12:08] explaining things being a Pulpit the
[1:12:10] only way we can shut it off is that we
[1:12:11] start to resemble Jesus
[1:12:15] that's the only way
[1:12:16] because Satan didn't do nothing when
[1:12:18] they was drunk no alkaline drunk man you
[1:12:20] know you see when the creeper man walk
[1:12:21] the devil tell all them demons you have
[1:12:23] to stop this thing here you know that's
[1:12:25] why the Pharisees we read this morning
[1:12:26] had a conference to say shutting them
[1:12:29] and say listen do more no more preaching
[1:12:30] in Jesus name don't talk about the
[1:12:32] thunder shutting over Windows unlock any
[1:12:35] blessing don't go there don't go there
[1:12:39] and then Brothers Were Soldiers boy men
[1:12:41] of the cloth they was right so there you
[1:12:43] know they say Lord strictness Mission
[1:12:45] comma please praise God we finish
[1:12:49] watch
[1:12:50] sixthly add brotherly um and then the
[1:12:53] Bible says adding brotherly kindness
[1:12:54] that's a good one dear add brotherly
[1:12:56] kindness then when we get to that
[1:12:58] broadly kindness when we get to that
[1:12:59] broadly kindness
[1:13:01] put yourself in his place on the matter
[1:13:05] so instead of presenting your point of
[1:13:07] view if I was he I'd do that put
[1:13:10] yourself in their shoes
[1:13:13] I see children carry on carry on Karen
[1:13:15] when their time come is a different
[1:13:16] thing yeah
[1:13:24] you find the child rude
[1:13:27] they himself
[1:13:31] see all right my brother sinned against
[1:13:33] me Peter said shall I forgive him seven
[1:13:35] times a day
[1:13:36] there's a big one you know
[1:13:38] do you see Peter put our number on that
[1:13:39] you know Jesus shall I forgive him seven
[1:13:41] times a day Jesus is 70 times seven
[1:13:44] there's a lot of times that's right
[1:13:47] brotherly kindness now you see if a
[1:13:49] brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:13:52] impatient with him
[1:13:55] go anyhow somebody said long long ago
[1:13:58] how can you believe these things the way
[1:14:00] you do and still go to Assemblies of God
[1:14:01] and Oneness and all the rest so brother
[1:14:04] Branham somebody asking around that hear
[1:14:05] his explanation
[1:14:07] see he has the virtues in him he said
[1:14:08] now watch then you see broadly kindness
[1:14:11] hoping someday patient with him
[1:14:14] Temperance and strong with him knowledge
[1:14:17] to understand what he believes remember
[1:14:19] it's in his heart virtue in yourself to
[1:14:22] Let It Go with kindness meekness to him
[1:14:25] having faith that someday God will bring
[1:14:28] him
[1:14:29] what Bradley Khan is the seventh thing
[1:14:31] then add charity
[1:14:33] which is love
[1:14:35] that's the captain Stone
[1:14:38] begin to play something by the Gideon
[1:14:40] charity add what charity
[1:14:43] which is love
[1:14:45] that is
[1:14:47] so it broadly count as we can fail
[1:14:49] but charity
[1:14:51] never feel it
[1:14:53] after your faithful truth would you
[1:14:54] knowledge your knowledge Temperance to
[1:14:56] your Temperance patience your patience
[1:14:57] governance to broadly kindness and so on
[1:14:59] and the Holy Spirit and Christ will come
[1:15:06] the holy spirit is the spirit of Jesus
[1:15:09] Christ into the church to Manifest this
[1:15:12] virtues
[1:15:13] so we cannot manifest it by revelation

[1:23:39] verse 23.
[1:23:42] for I have received of the Lord
[1:23:44] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:23:48] by the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:23:50] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:23:54] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:23:56] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:24:01] is broken for you this due in
[1:24:03] remembrance of me
[1:24:05] after the same manner also he took the
[1:24:08] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:24:11] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:24:13] blood this Dewey as often as you drink
[1:24:16] it in remembrance of me
[1:24:19] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:24:21] drink this cup he do show the Lord's
[1:24:24] death till he comes
[1:24:26] wherefore whosoever shall eat his bread
[1:24:29] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:24:30] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:24:33] and blood of the Lord
[1:24:35] but let a man examine himself
[1:24:38] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:24:40] drink of that cup
[1:24:42] and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink
[1:24:46] a damnation to himself not Discerning
[1:24:49] the Lord's body
[1:24:50] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:24:54] among you and many sleep
[1:24:56] for if we will judge ourselves we should
[1:24:59] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:25:03] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[1:25:05] not be condemned with the will
[1:25:08] as Paul has them close our eyes
