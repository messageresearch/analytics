the prophet who we know is William Maran Branham before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers they I come and smite the Earth with a curse Matthew 3:16 and 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Matthew chapter 17 and after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up onto a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them his face was shine as the sun his rainment as white as the light and behold he appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus lord it's good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias while he yet speak Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased he ye him let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight and Lord you're trying to get sons from Matthew 3 to graduate to Matthew 17 where is not just this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased but three more words are added hear ye Him Father a son placed in a position of authority and power and that son has to be a son that has your character that has your nature that has your life Lord your Prophet taught us that power without character is satanic and We Know by the word that you're looking to try sons and prove Sons to bring them into a place of adoption help us tonight as we approach your word help us tonight and we invite you Holy Spirit to bring Insight divine revelation inspiration upon your word speak to every heart here tonight confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen and amen you may be seated as I give the Lord some worship title to title tonight the restoration of the person of Christ by Malachi 4 oh bless blessed be the name of the Lord the restoration of the person of Christ by Malachi 4 on Sunday we were talking about just a small recap that there where the Pentecostal people made a mistake we think as soon as we become sons and daughters that settles it we just come into a place of trying the Methodist said as soon as they shouted the Lutheran said the believe on by faith no matter what kind of position God put you in you are still growing you are still going on to perfection isn't that right now remember the Holy Spirit has got to bring God everything that every professing Christian say about it so that means that the Son of God Jesus when he got off the water he began to be tried and tested as a son isn't that right he said what are you preaching that for brother brandham I want to see the Church of God in deep sincerity I want to see the oldfashioned preens I want to see The Times They can't leave the church they want to stay all night and pray and fast and call out till God answers instead of that it seemed the love have dwindled away from us the love of God now he spoke about the negative when the son didn't behave himself but he said but if the boy then then he's still a son now we not talking about serpent seed we not talking about false anointed ones we're not talking about false prophets we're not talking about second Timothy he and high minded lovers of we're not talking about that we are still speaking about Sons and Daughters of God Sons and Daughters of God not evil people not evil workers not Shock we talking about sons and da how many understand that tonight we are not talking about negative we only talking about the bride the Sons and Daughters of God rather I want to say the Sons and Daughters of God now watch this now now this the boy if he come up the way and didn't what did not obedient did not have the action of his father did not carry his father's business on the way his father did then that child missed all its inheritance another brother had to take its place that's a powerful one now today if we try to take the church before God under a common Creed we all believe the same thing believe some scripture or theology that's not the way Jesus Took the church before the father God wants the church the part we have to kick with how God wants the church not how man have it not how people like it no but how God wants it God wants the church before God watch God wants the church to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's God's will not you come and just get baptized not you come and occupy a Pew not you come and shake the pastor's hand and get a free Bible no not that's not what he wants he wants the church filled with the with the Holy Ghost could we say amen he want the church filled with the Holy Ghost watch watch doing the same works that he did when he was here on Earth that's the kind of church that the teacher the holy spirit will want to present before God he don't want to say we just Gathering he want to say we have the same life the same signs the same wonders this church looking like it ready to take off this church looking like it ready for the Rapture Express that's the kind of church he's coming for that church could only have 12 people in it it don't have to have 100 it don't have to have 50 people but I'm say if the church stood original we wouldn't have more than 50 but the people Will Be Blood wash and the word will be spoken word by word by word amen amen oh hallelujah hallelujah remember what Isaac preached Su the evening that guy with the flag and he's going on to the hearts of the enemy and the people were losing the battle and they said bring back the flag he said no bring up the men Hallelujah that's what we need stop lowering the standard bring up the men raise a standard there going to be a perfect church I much Devils walk the earth there's going to be Sons and Daughters of the Living God and don't care what child you have been through amen that's the thing God will do to his sons on Earth someday he will call you a side church amen if you will obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church and that's what we have to look for he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church all the power that Christ had in him will be in the church Hallelujah all of us in God he Christ all of us in Christ he poured into the church isn't that right the father wanted a work done he poured into the son the son want to work done he pour it into the church and what the same power that rest in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in the body of Christ that means that there going to be some sons that going to be placed not by a convention not by man but by God himself he will call you aside as a son this is my beloved Son Give the Lord some praise PR people oh hallelujah hallelujah this has nothing to do with Baptist Methodist Jo witness this has nothing to do with the Pope and the Catholic churches have nothing to do with any part of the world this is God and his son oh give the Lord a shout of Praise oh Hallelujah are you with me now placing him in a position isn't that right his son is a position isn't that right and then he said here this prophecy he said the very same watch placing him a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before Angels Place him positionally here what he is in the body of Christ then that son has the authority let me say this if you C me to be a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power prophecy come into the church and now it's coming in Prophecy that the Holy Spirit prophecy will so anoint the people till will speak the word prophecy and it will create itself right there prophecy we haven't seen power likes coming to the church I know it for a fact say unto this mountain don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said shall come to pass the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church the critics M will be shut it will be a short time it won't last long but it will be here amen oh that's what I'm holding on to tonight by these promises I'm holding on to these promises every promise I can find I'm picking it up it belongs to me it belongs to you it belongs to the Sons and Daughters of God the devil is trying to cover it up all these years but the angel said seal not the Saints of the prophecy of the book because the time is at handj oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be seated let's go further souls in prison now not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not by fruit of the spirit Christian Science had could have SM any of you in that and even night Jus was divine it's the word living there it is if they only look he was the Messiah am he was here we go Living Word made manifest amen or the word made manifest is Messiah and man that's got the spirit of God in him or woman lives that word writes out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people you mean the word of the Lord comes to the elect yes the word of the Lord comes to the bride yes the word of the Lord will come to you now listen to this bum he said now watch there they are the words of the people written Epistles read of all men could the third pull be on question I'm not talking about just the open of the word turp or King sword TDP or spoken word turp but the word Living Word manifested written Epistles Hallelujah here we go what is it so who's in prison still look at the scripture could it be is the third pill to preach the Eternal Doom remember when Jesus died he didn't just die he went and had a Ministry Amen to those who were lost those who once heard the message under Noah all of them all Through the Ages he went to preach the souls that could not be saved Souls that was in prison Hallelujah and he said Jesus ministry come back to do the same thing preach to people who no longer could be saved who had an opportunity to repent who had an opportunity to get their heart transformed and changed because they're going to come an hour him that's filthy filthy still righteous still holy still come an hour when everybody going to be caught in a set condition there is no change now is it time to change in other words it almost come like God take a picture a snapshot and that's it whenever that picture caught you that's it are you with me he said could the third P be on because the bride final Ministry is Jesus final Ministry yes sir preaching to souls that cannot be saved what a time what a hour oh Hallelujah here we go but I want something get you something here remember Noah was in the the bride is sealed with Christ he's prophesying the last member has been redeemed that means from Fatal to charity that that doesn't mean saved it means redeemed redeemed is to bring you back from where you were before he is prophesying when the last member is redeemed the six seal has produced itself which is Judgment he's still prophesying the seven seal brings him back to Earth amen the lamb come took the book of the right hand and sat down and claim what he own what he has redeemed that has always been the third Pearl oh Hallelujah here we go and I love this quote tree is perfection amen the ministry has come to its Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural among human beings notice he didn't say Christ reproduced by Revelation by teachings by messages he said Christ reproduced in the natural in other words Christ have to begin to Mo ooze out of us so it can't be you parading your beef parading your flesh God is not interested in no flesh parade it can't be you this is me and this always was that's you we don't want to see you s we would see Jesus Oh Hallelujah Hallelujah from an eager stir this Nest brother brandham Lord we are bringing to close this portion of service tonight and we thank thee because that thou has given us so many things to look at nature the word the bird life the life of the eagle the life of the tree and the greatest example we have is the Life of Christ which was to be reproduced in Us by the Holy Spirit could we give the Lord a shout of praise so in other words God put a seed in you and that Life of Christ is to be reproduced and you turn living with you you want to live with Jesus now you want to get out of the way and he's saying the Life of Christ is to be reproduced In You by the Holy Spirit oh give the Lord a praise offering absolute we are embarked s in lifestyle and me and Christ to the ship upon the storms of time and when the storms get heavy and they're pitching about I'm glad I've got an anchor that holds within the veil Yonder somewhere even debt itself can't pluck your away from it you are tied to your absolute Christ is your anchor what is he he's the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God then we know watch here we go are you ready then when we know that our actions is exactly with the word we know our teaching is perfect with the word adding nothing taking nothing just the word and we see the same results that others who are anchored to the same word living up in our life then your anchor holds the Life of Christ being reproduced in an almost incarnate way through you as it was in Christ because it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself oh Hallelujah sit still little flop positionally stay where you are as sister Gertie said used to sing Keep Holding On don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to the church that is what is holding back the coming of Christ and the great Millennium is this great Supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church question if Christ is to come and he is waiting for this Supernatural power that lays dormant in this church only when that power is activated it brings an attraction to Christ oh hallelujah it's almost like an outer space business that we have something to beam out and when we beam out that thing that big spacecraft out there that big Rapture Express out there going to get a signal on the earth that we are ready to leave because we are lighting up come on say Amen somebody we are lightting up come on give the Lord a shout of praise the Life of Christ is thundering Give the Lord we sending signals to the world beyond beyond there was a moon Beyond a star beyond the next Universe we sending out signals we are the morning Stars anouncing the sun is coming oh we are Overcomers receiving the Morning Star which is the reflection as the Perfection the reflection is the Perfection when we reflect Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he's going to be in you reflecting himself In You by and through the bride will be fulfilled all Glory Hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah God is waiting you be seated for us to get away from our transition and come after the blood of his son Jesus Christ and become the Church of the Living God I like that become the Church of the Living God not church no of the Living God W Hallelujah not just church but become the Church of the the Living God that's what David challenged Goliath who are you to defy the armies of the Living God oh give the Lord some praise his people if God is alive you're going to feel it if God is alive you're going to see it if God is alive you're going to experience it if God is alive you're going to be Anointed with it the Church of the Living God oh Hallelujah we have churches but we want to see the Church of the Living God you could say God lives in that church he's living in the sons and daughters in that church he is in the house of the people in that church we see God we know God we experience God he is moving In and Out Among Us oh give the Lord some Praises that's the church he wants to identify himself oh Hallelujah Glory Oh Glory brother Brandon we have seen his star he said watch he said now watch my word in you you abide in me my words abide in you ask what you will that is Christ in you are you ready now this was heavy stuff I was to preaching Sunday couldn't get through was more pastoral but this is stuff we got to get it tonight hallelujah praise God now watch he said that's Christ in you anointing the word for this age whatever age watch you they lived in God divided his word to ages God divided his word into ages isn't that right are you with me and every time it comes that time the church all scrupled up and God anoints somebody send it down he this to make the word act not more talk hallelujah hallelujah God send the anointing to anoint somebody to make the word what to make the word act watch watch to make the word act just exactly the way he said it did amen there's a word prophesy of this day and God is waiting for somebody to find somebody it's not to un usual to that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so you mean the anointing of the Holy Ghost it must have to come to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever so you will see how far this theological intellectual intellectually call it gymnastics flipping here and flipping there is irrelevant to the mystery of God to be expressed you would see how far it is from the real thing because the Bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God but then something happened and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us that was the mystery of God being revealed oh hallelujah oh glory to God not the mystery coming my mystery no but the mystery coming in Simplicity that the word become in flesh and dwell Among Us oh Hallelujah Hallelujah all the prophet was summarized in the person called Jesus Christ and all the mission will be summarized in you cuz you're going to be flesh of his flesh come on now you you're going to be bone of his bone you're going to be Spirit of his spirit because you are designated female wife of the Lamb oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah and the woman came Plum out of the man and you came right out of Christ you can reflect nothing but him because the woman ref the man Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah the woman reflect the man's objective the man motive the man intent GL Hallelujah huah Hallelujah God is waiting on you and I am me and you the church is waiting on me in adoption time when God can point us his fullness his resurrection and the church and Christ become so close together here we go till Christ become visible not give me a scripture not you're reading a ssal until Christ I want that to be your expectation you want to see Christ become visible in your life Oh Glory so he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers seven tunders give Faith which is a seed and then we get Spirit virtue not knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness Hallelujah that say add to your faith because Fai is a revelation faith is what's revealed to you but you're going to add to your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance you're going to be like the Lily oh my the pond is stink filth is coming down your way every day old tires old oil Down the River of Life all kind of negative all kind of lust demon sex Spirit naked woman you name it it's coming down but you like the Lily and you you press your way Hallelujah you ins stink water you in filthy water but you are not that water come on now that that water no no no no no you are there's something inside of you making you push push way Hallelujah hell is on the Earth but you're pushing you're pushing because something is calling you can't push if something not calling it got to be a deep calling to a deep that they going to be a deep to respond oh Hallelujah you can't even explain it Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Jes the Queen of Sheba Queen of the South travel so many miles hundreds of miles to hear the wisdom of Solomon am she brought camel she brought and she had to pass through Bandits and thieves and everybody else but she was still coming there was a deep calling into a deep because she know this was more than a man Hallelujah and you got to get in contact with something more than intellectual understanding more than argument more than debate more than theology more than quotes more than all of that you have got to thirst after reality that's why David said as the heart panted after the water broke so my soul thirst after God oh are you seeing people hungering are you see people thirsting H thirsting for Revival he said what we see should make a Revival something and you got to want a Revival you you got to be hunging for Revival Revival in you oh and said let me be a Revival you got to become the Revival fire in your soul fire in your heart fire all over you like the song said it's all over me and it's keeping me alive it's the Holy Ghost and fire it's the Holy Ghost and power do you see it tonight Oh Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Oh Glory to God Amen so the fullness is Charity to come down anoint the seed of the fullness of the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ in your heart which is the seven Thunders seven tund the seed and the world and message World reject that seven Thunder Baby Oh Glory to God they didn't like how it come they didn't like what it was about Hallelujah because it gives you Faith who the bride God is the bride together who it show how to prepare isn't that right they going to UT to the bride isn't that right inside they have new name isn't that right inside they have transforming power but let me drop this bomb on you with the restoration of the person comes the restoration of virtue powerful service because in the person have power oh glory to Christ come Among Us you know you know you're going to be healed right you know you're going to be seal right you know be delivered right oh do you see it tonight Hall remember just as John the Baptist he came in an in between age there was the all up to Malachi there was no prophets isn't that right Messiah was promised and in between there they had a history of Sadducees scribes Pharisees isin all of them amen bunch of interpretation theology traditions and there were in their ways for many many years John getting a different name from the Levi and the all different kind of Jewish names he get John call him John God wanted that name John that was a disturbance by itself just the name because he wasn't on the regular kind like ezekiah Jeremiah Zachariah you know different kind of thing say call him John put John on there let the name alone trouble them Hallelujah John is down there John and then next God said thr him in the wilderness he have a passion for the Wilderness why the scriptures say voice of Cry of wilderness so God put a Wilderness scorpion man Wilderness rugged Man Wilderness honey man eating bees and honey whatever it is Wilderness man to come out of the Wilderness and say repent Hallelujah because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand oh John was rocking them and shaking them up he was bringing something different they expected something to go in continuity with what was there before and John was interrupting it was an interruption praise God it was a hallelujah praise God with a seal about to break a Seal Seal is spiritual Interruption Church interrupted Church rocking and John John just in coming to introduce Messiah and when they thought he was hot he said there was one standing among you that man he going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost on Fire if you think I just come to do something I I this is small I'm not worthy to unloose his shoes but fire com and Power coming the glory coming Dynamic is coming oh how quicking Power is coming I can feel it tonight it's coming it's here the Dynamics is here and so are the mechanics if we could just get started I hope you get started tonight I hope you rise up and begin to anoint your promises to yourself tonight oh glory to God Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory all right let's go man events made clear by prophecy you are Gene of your father and you were in your father yet your father had no Fellowship in you so in gene form there is no Fellowship but watch but there was a beding ground he was he manifested you that you could have fellowship with you so in the natural you in the gene of your father and then through a womb isn't that right sperman come together you become expressed manifest and when you become expressed you still can't get Fellowship yet until you grow up until he could walk and talk and and get words isn't that right and the same way we were in his jeans we were in his thoughts we could not fellowship with our father so he make us bypass what he offering drop us down on Earth and say them son going to come out in their age in their time in their season in their dispensation and we are going to have Fellowship oh give the Lord some Praises people now I don't know if I want to get it it but Luther was in the womb wesi was in the womb even the Pentecostal was in the womb that's why the Mysteries couldn't be made known to them so therefore God can not fellowship with them because they were in the womb but when Malachi for came he came to release that came to bring a b that we could be born in this hour that we could grow up in this hour that God could say this is my son he is alive he is born oh give the Lord some praises God going to have some fellowship Oh Glory Hallelujah but oh you know I saying that that's the next quote right here I don't know if I get it it's right here question and answers here when you use the Expression if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish virgin will live eternally but they will be separated from the New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the bride here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again there's a question if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does the spiritual birth requires all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again he said absolutely amen he says uh absolutely I just explained that this morning you've got to have all stages you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the mother's womb but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost you are born then you are not converted you are in the process of being converted until that time here we go that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that just passed by us Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten now the person of Christ himself the son of man revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come till that time so therefore God was waiting for this special bride age to bring on the Mysteries Hallelujah to the sons isn't that right he says now he said justification by faith was a wide sphere and we never move from that Along Came Wesley John Wesley it shook them down and down and brought her down to sanctification live a good clean life sanctify by the word of God give joy in your heart that shook a lot of Lutheran Doctrine then Along Came the Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that narrowed on again and the gifts and the restoration and the spirit of God had come in in the fullness of signs and wonders into the church and That Shook Pentecost what is it we are so close to the coming of Jesus until here we go people talking about the Trump and talking about the coming of the Lord but listen this we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus watch until the very same spirit that was in him is working in the church not more teachings it have to move from word to Spirit we have to see the spirit itself beginning to work Hallelujah watch watch until working in the church doing doing the very same things he did that he was here on Earth it's never been anywhere back from the time of the Apostle till this time why it's narrow it Narrows what is it here we go just like your hand come into a shadow negative negative well it's a reflection what was Luther so you put Luther as a reflection on your hand but as you get nearer it coming closer to the to the real thing isn't that right isn't that right the shadow blending it with the real thing so watch what was Luther a reflection of Christ what was Bley a reflection of Christ but we the end Time Each man looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ but they had to look forward to the return of the Jews flying sources in the skies all the things that we see today we at the end time we are here now they know here we go they know the church was to receive a power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as a shadow becomes deeper and deeper you take a sh shade further away from the shade the least reflection you get of the shade and while the shade get closer to the tree the shade is the same thing now the spirit that work under justification and Luther sanctification under Wesley baptism of Holy Ghost under the Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that he did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one so he's identifying his ministry as a sign of the church and Christ becoming one isn't that right now here we go and watch they will connect together and she will go through the sky shouting up will come Wesley Lu to all the rest of them back there and he that is first will be last and last will be first and they'll come a resurrection we are the end time what was the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost does excuse me the Holy Ghost by justification see a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism a deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost here we go by the restoration of its very person being here performing signs and wonders like he did at the beginning he said who Glory call call me Holy Roller you may as well get started right now so justification Shadow sanctification Shadow baptism Shadow but the restoration of the person that's the real thing oh let me say this way justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made way for the Battle of Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself that is your promise oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah from Paradox what is it Christ coming to his body here we go I'm not talking about false anointed I'm not talking about second Timothy I'm not talking about false prophets I'm not talking about bad behaved Christians I'm not talking about that amen I'm talking about Sons and Daughters of God oh are you with me Give the Lord some Praises people I don't just say amen I Want You To Worship what is it Christ come to his body I like that who is his body his wife his Bri Christ coming to his body do you know who you are you are his body Christ coming to his body who is Christ Christ the anointed Christ coming through his body who is body you are his body you are his Tabernacle you his Temple you are the one you want to dwell in you want to make you a living moving Monument the world only have dead monuments building out of bronze and concrete but you going to be a living one oh Hallelujah this is good you're going to be a living Monument hallu now watch Christ come into his body and Christ is the word we all know the anointing is Christ amen amen do you know that the anointing is what Christ Christ

Hallelujah the more you die out ah the more you empty out the more he fills that vacancy the more he fills that space and eventually he will work his way right out till you will see God in the natural I have some stuff here watch but BR now watch he has appeared to us in the same form he did to the Old Testament New Testament show is the same word same Christ and I declare to you that Christ is the Holy Ghost the word Christ means the anointed one a person that's anointed that is the Christ the anointed one the anointed one now there would be a man that would be anointed Anointed with what the Bible said acts through that Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God Anointed with the Holy Ghost went and done great things that was God manifested it prove that he was in this man now here we go we become Anointed with that same Spirit anointed Messiahs amen Messiah of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he is in his people moving among his bride with a love a fear to her pouring out into her himself Hallelujah they become one for the wedding supper same signs promised by the same God making the same manifestation oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Glory justification service time sanctification service time until the bapt Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost at service time until the Holy Spirit which is one God Blends into the church and the church into Christ and it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth amen what he promised here in the Bible you might not believe it I can't make you do that I'm responsible for the word so friends I want you to get it clear in your heart and mind is not coming down here to church to take notes amen it has to come to a point where you have to take note that they have been with Jesus it's a different kind of note for years people writing and they trying to educate theel and understand this mystery and understand that mystery and they want to know more mystery the Bible said in the last days they shall Heap unto themselves teachers having itting ears they want to hear every new thing every new revelation every new stuff but that's not what it's all about that's why said knowledge shall increase not just natural science but even spiritual knowledge but it's not just to have knowledge in the form of knowledge no knowledge has to come by Revelation that knowledge there in the virtues is not intellectual knowledge that is not chemistry and biology and physics and logic and whatnot that's God's knowledge that's the knowledge to know that God can't lie that God will keep his word that's the knowledge of God that God can't fail and he's the same yated in Forever that's the knowledge of God hallelujah that God is a liive and he's in the Affairs of men God is Not Invisible and and away from he's actively working among his people are you with me watch brother Bram he's talking about the Revival and they asked the police man where is the Revival and he tipped his heart he says sir the weth Revival is in here pointing to his heart it's in me and then B say oh God yeah oh God if we can only understand that we are the reflection of Jesus Christ his word made manifest you are the reflection of his word and today here we go the church ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth because I live you shall live also isn't that right I'm going notice Hallelujah so the church ought to be what Jesus Christ in action some people have got so natural so Canal so ordinary just like life living life you know it's something something you hear me spoke about before people who get money suddenly whether by Lottery by whatever lot whatever it is within 7 years or so 70% of them lose all yes because they don't feel it will finish so they SPL they spin they thing like that they don't feel it was done they don't see the mind have so much that it wouldn't go down and this is the problem of life people don't people don't believe that they would have to leave this earth that to pack up sh they believe they live here forever so they could fight and F and quarrel and hold ODS and Grudge and they going down the road amen never seeing that there's an end of time never seeing that we only have a slot to do our do and do all that we can do Hallelujah it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness here we go let me just shake it a little bit now as we get to the I would say close yet but home stretch now watch notice there's many people just can't believe it even spiritual fill people I'm going to give you one that will choke you this is to choke you he said this is one to choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism but there's a inside Soul there that's got to come from God oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord that's why you should be shouting tonight hallelujah praise God your Insight insight watch he said remember in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives so like a seed you have three parts you have a soul you have a spirit and you have a body you can be baptized in your spirit still not make it but that soul that seed that germ that comes from godall you didn't start that God started that God placed you in the Lamb's Book of Life you are a gene taught in his mind before it became word that was your Gene taught that was your soul back in God isn't that right and that soul that seed is what God put inside of you and put you in dirt and plant you on the earth and let the devil take you are just one of them normal seeds but you are a mystery Hallelujah and the Mystery is in your history where you come from where was thou when I lay the foundation of the earth and the morning I sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy you was not you didn't come in the beginning you were there before the beginning that's where you come from that's where your anointing comes from that's where your tan is at before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a word you would have thought that was in God and a word is a thought expressed so when God want to express you he expressed the word and the word is God so that's why when you hear the word there is an instant connection you can't help it if it's something that's built inside of you you can't even control it it is just something that's inside of you you are a thought that God has expressed by his word oh glory to God and it could only be a word if you was a taught to begin with oh you had to be a taught to become word to become word you have to be a jean T oh give the Lord some Praises people that is why you ought to be shouting every service praising God every service that is why in the upper room there were dry seeds in the upper room there were dry wood in the upper room waiting for the Spirit to fall and when the spirit Begin to Fall they begin to St like drunk men oh Hallelujah having a Revival they how to walk like drunk man oh hallelujah praise God we want to leave you drunk in the spirit they said these people in a drunk as you suppose but this is that that the prophet Jo spake of oh there was new wine there was stimulated by the revelation of the Holy Ghost coming upon them there's going to be another stimulation there's going to be another Jubilee you're going to be released from your sins you going to be released from your guilt you going to be released from your past you shall be delivered the fire going to break upon your soul hallelu Hall you Lord you may be seated Glory Hallelujah some preachers take this this quot or the baptism ghost amen you're not going to go in with that to make the people don't even believe in the Bost they believe they have the seat in his soul and that's it but Peter didn't say I have the seat in his soul are go on uper room I don't need that Peter didn't say that Peter had his seed in his soul and he waited because Jesus said behold I send the promise of my father you see you have to rightly divide the word I send the promise of my father upon you T in the city until you receive power from on high amen now they had power before Matthew 10 power which was temporary power Judas was there with that power that power was only temporary that power was only to play for a time but this was permanent power this it was this was residual power this was Dynamic power now Dynamic power is power with the Dynamo inside I'm not hearing Dynamic power is not just an anointing Dynamic power is the Dynamo is inside so you could whip it up anytime you could call it up anytime you could say silver and gold Have I None anytime such as I have anytime I give it to you anytime come on give the Lord some Praises people that's the Dynamics you talking about in other words you are walking Dynamo you are

that when they lay hands upon the sick not pray just lay hands just lay hands upon the sick they recovered why they were so charged up that battery was working that's not a temporary battery that's not a solar battery that's Dynamic power of God battery that recharges itself it renews itself oh hallelujah it's power itself give me a scripture Jesus said he believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow not one River oh my God rivers of living water out of your belly Oh Glory to God I wonder where the river coming from it mean there's a Dynamo inside of there it mean there's an aesan well inside the de something springing up something breaking out something coming up you can't help it because because it's inside you you already it's inside you can't help it oh

man of man you are you got to look into the word and you got to see yourself in the word and you have to be transformed by the word and you become what to behold and we looking in that image are transformed from glory to glory by the spirit of the Living God oh Hallelujah we are going back to the original Glory we are going back to the glory of God we are going back to the rainbow Glory that's the rainbow Glory that was before the foundation of the world we are coming right back to that because with the restoration of the word come the restoration of power and God promised to restore the person of Christ Among Us by bringing on the faith to pull down the power to act the very life of God in the hearts and life of the people am amen amen hallelujah what does church have to do with what I just said this what I just preached applies anywhere any country any people amen this has nothing to do with any church this is not a church mess message this is Sons and Daughters of God have

are really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were in Christ because he was the fullness of the word and he reconciled the world to himself do you believe that he was in Christ that if you are in God a gene a word a attribute from the beginning then you walked with him when he was on Earth then you talked with him when you were on Earth then you suffered with him on Earth then you died with him at Calvary then you Rose with him again and you are sitting in Heavenly places communing with him as the word feeds into your soul as the word feeds into your soul Hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen so Christ spoke of an elected people for the last days it would receive the very elected if were possible Christ himself said that there would be an elected people so you are not ordinary you're not just a bunch of just people on the Earth he said that the devil shall deceive the very elect if it was possible so Christ himself defin the pride in this hour she's not chosen by man she's elected by God oh Hallelujah the people can live clean holy life not be sinful adulterers and drinkers Liars gamblers and live about that and still not with it Hallelujah so why look at you you know you no good you have a mirror of the word and that's what you have to focus on if you look longer a crook you'll become a crook if it look longer a thief you'll become a thief whatever you're focusing on whatever you're connecting with the atmosphere that they release you'll be connected with that that's why you got to that's why B say if you want the Holy Ghost hang around with people with the Holy Ghost because they generate a certain thing you hang with the wrong people you get the wrong thoughts the wrong atmosphere the wrong words coming out your mouth praise God because you're hanging out with the wrong crowd oh hallelujah praise God this is the age of lifeu personal life of Christ isn't that right Hallelujah this is the age of Life the Bible say husband love your wife I didn't say that the bible say that you have to live that that's right children obey your parents that had to be lived amen amen husband s your wife with wisdom that had to be lived wife Rend husband that had to be lived am lived and I like that live voice am that's the Thunder that shakes not not alive voice people talking talking we have some live voices in this message a lot of live talk but live voice means you have been through something youve been there youve been through the flood you have been through the pain you have been in hospital bed he cast you in a bed of sickness he turn this one against you have lives you got to go through stuff that is why I like it because you see through the Seven Ages these are live voices the life of God lived through Through the Ages so you're getting qualified life this life overcoming every age in and that overcoming life is God releasing in you so you're going to slap up the devil that's right like sometime when my children going into exams I tell them um you going to slap it up you know when you have exams I say slap it up I said slap it up the exams when you're going to do test and I say you going to slap it up I say yeah that's what I want to hear not not ex going to beat you because ex beat people oh yeah oh yeah people go the exam room get El they come up the head down because they didn't study didn't learn nothing exam beat them up but when you see you loan your stuff you going to slap up the exam exam is not in charge you in charge they they bringing the paper for you to have Victory yes then when you begin to see that so you ready you want to go in the exam room how the amen song is light on that like I don't want to go in the exam room or and them brothers kep brother Hallelujah Brothers been quiet you know where I'm going with that right when your pictures change you want to go in your exam room you sit down 5 years in a school and do one in the exam room you can't wait to bring out your weapons of war Hallelujah the teachers bringing this trick question and that and sometime they bring things that they look like if they never taught it but it veiled in it and you're looking for the tricks there have tricks devil have tricks too but you have to recognize every one of his tricks that's when they come to discernment now that you understand that your life is a special life and the devil is one to deceive you mess you up throw you down make places for you to fall and your job is to say wait wait hold it right there no no no no no I I see you I see you right there and you let him stay right there isn't that right and then you start to get Victory upon Victory just small victories Victory upon Victory that's the problem people are not getting Victory you need Victory you've got to begin to get victory over the world over yourself over your thought you got to begin you got to want it your passion for victory must be stronger than your fear of defeat Give the Lord a shout of Praise now it's later than we ever go before but I'm still here and you are still here so relax and get down in the word now your passion for victory must be greater than your fear of defeat amen I'm not hearing the amen I want to hear I'm hearing surface amen I want to hear amen from your soul your passion of Victory must be greater than your fear of defeat that's why Gideon under that mental thing God turn on complex really God has bust that up on that mental thing of being the least and Son God had to tell Gideon uh say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon now Gideon didn't have a sword he had lamp to break he had no physical sword he just had to say it God tell him to say something he didn't even have in his hand literally say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and then break the lamp break the picture on the lamp and so on Gideon has to get courage to say the sword of the Lord and of if you the confidence sword of the Lord that's good sword of the Lord I mean sword of the that's God's sword you have no problem with that that's the fact but and of Gideon yeah yeah God said put your name in it and of Gideon and all he did he break it and those guys panic and begin to fight one another get battle over obedience just do what God say and you would see the results in your life in your home in your family it it look simple Jesus told the lepers Go and show yourself to the priest very simple he didn't say go and B down in the river he didn't say go and take some green b or he blew B he said Go and show yourself to the priest he knew along the way they'll be made whole and that's all just obey what God say take up your bed and walk just take up your bed and walk don't say I raise up off this bed in the last 30 years forget that God say pick up bed make an effort turn lean make a let let God see your hand moving to lift up the bed but take up your bed and walk come out your condition stop wanting people just to pray for you pray for you you ain't praying for your own self you're miserable in your own self stop that tell yourself I can do all things tell yourself I'm a son of the king tell yourself you have access rights to your father tell yourself the kingdom can kick you out come on S somebody come on give the Lord some Praises people I think I'm going to close here my goodness page 8 out of 13 almost there you know but brother you would wouldn't like to hear the the next part of this thing here you would like to hear this thing oh hallelujah praise God but as Moses was calling a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see watch now nothing against them he says to refuse the person that's doing the calling no matter if you are Pentecostal Baptist nothing against them not at all but this is the age you have got to accept the person of Christ which is the word amen oh Lord my goodness could I five more minutes again Christ Mission got revealed bam said the new birth then what is it now look look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ here we go now Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing no I know you didn't get that amen amen all the Mysteries all the teachings all the things that that sum UPS into Christ in you what's the new bir then brother brandham what is the new birth it is a revelation of Christ personally to you not you join church not you shook your hand or anything like that what is it here we go you say well I'm Lutheran I'm Baptist I'm Presbyterian that don't mean a thing to God you're in the message that doesn't mean a thing to God god listen to what this here now what is it are you ready it is Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself now people only create Revelation with information knowledge and talk ification I know there not a word talking yapping they could talk it they talk in Revelation but when Christ is revealed it is expressed so that's the purpose of Jesus Christ to express himself so all these Services teachings words is to eventually become flesh in you that Christ comes out of you that people could take note that you have been with Jesus because Peter couldn't even write his name the Bible said they were ignorant and unlearned but they had to take note that they had been with Jesus because Christ Was Made Alive made manifest in them as was in Moses these guys had no CXC no GC no passes no University degree no Masters nothing like that but they had Christ in them listen you know who he Christ is the mystery of God living in them and that is what got to live in you so you see when you have that there is no Baptist Methodist there's no argument the manifestation is the interpretation Oh Glory to God here we go I'm almost done watch so Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual whether he don't know his ABC half the Apostle didn't know it but they know Christ am so the new but is a revelation God has revealed to you this Grace mystery it's a personal individual Fe with the person that Christ is revealed to them so this Mo group inspiration this make May group think group theology this is you and God not you and your family not you and your brethren not you and this group in and small group and and and we gather together and we believe this it have no we believe it is Christ expressing himself through you do you believe that hear this part now if you say I know you heard this before but it will come fresh tonight if you say he has been revealed to me and the life that Christ produced here in the Bible does not produce itself in you you got the wrong Revelation oh Hallelujah so the Revelation brings the life the real Revelation that's why the Bible B about these divinely revealed mystery truths is what will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so we understand now people have more intellectual Faith than real revelation of the Holy Ghost coming down inside their faith because that will give you an anchor when the Storm come you'll be anchored Paul said it this way what can separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus shall persecution shall pressure shall think nothing present nothing to come going to separate me from that goal from that love from that purpose watch wow and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the pinenes to the people and they see the very Life Works signs wonders what he did watch outside of that the rest of it is not even called to watch by lack of this Revelation is why we are so much divisions and so much mockery so much divisions because the people lack the Revelation they lack Revelation the teachers so because the teachers don't have the Revelation teaching all kind of crazy stuff all kind of foolish stuff and the people taking the stuff T to say I am right you are wrong we are higher you are lower we are in front you are behind we have something you don't and there a bunch of immaturity that God can't come and confirm no foolishness like that God will strip people strip Isaiah strip this one and strip that one Jesus went through three 30 years of hard trials three half years of harder trials to get an approved son why because character is not a gift am we could never overemphasize that character is the victory you can't pay for character you can't bribe for character you can't pass money for character you can say you have this and you get character praise God most of the time people with a lot of stuff have no character Hallelujah after they get blessed they get arrogant they get proud everything else God had to break people the Bible say Jesus learned obedience by the thing that he suffered God wants character but character is not a gift God can't give you that you have to overcome something that's why the trial after a while become the the greatest thing in your life because every trial means an opportunity for victory every trial means an opportunity to be changed every trial mean an opportunity for your nature to be affected Glory so you're not afraid of the storms you're not afraid of the battle you stand like a man answer me where was thou hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so but say You must be born again he says a great subject because you can't understand the kingdom to approach the birth you've got to go through a process just like anything in our lives you've got to die to go through the born again Watch just two more things you cannot keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you've got to die how many understand you cannot have your way you have your way in your mother house not in the house of God God have no spoiled children you will be a son you'll be a daughter but you'll have no inheritance youve got to die you have got to die die amen hallelujah praise God Amen so when you go to church accept a Creed former baptism offering you are supposed to lay there watch until you reckon Yourself Dead far from above the altar isn't that right I'm closing now watch in very plain language now according to Romans 4:16 watch the Bible talk about Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted to seed children as children of promise and promise have to do with elect ction the choosing of God that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seeds are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally do not express until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it become Express and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and she is feminine in designation she is called the body of Christ and he is the head Oh Glory to God it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and now manifested God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our lord Jesus christu we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore were reborn because only the elect can be reborn so when Jesus said you must be born again he was talking to elect oh give the Lord some Praises people oh Hallelujah Glory now watch brother B talking about Samson here is my only hope this morning to wind my message up while Samson was bong and you Sher here grow out oh let them laugh at us let them laugh at what happened in the church let them laugh what happened to people and so on but while Samson was b a new shocker

accompany the apostles he said while we in prison surely God is going to crop somewhere for that last great k yes may it be you my Christian friends that your strength is beginning to come back so the seventh Thunder Revival is to bring a deliverance from every spirit that will keep the principles of the kingdom of God from flowing through you that will stop God's righteousness from flowing through you the seven Thunder Revival is the last great kill to kill the lion demons the lust demons all the demons the seven Thunders is the last great kill he said May the Samson of God May the true in heart those who are longing and crying and pleading and holding on May they stay with it Lord until this new crop grows out until they come forth a joy in Zion and they come for a group that can recognize and understand and can see the Messiah and the hidden powers that hit from the world that they will understand it now Lord oh give the Lord some praise His People oh Hallelujah glory and
