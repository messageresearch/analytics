[25:51] here tonight
[25:54] it's a reading from Luke chapter 14
[25:56] reading verse 16.
[25:59] then said he unto him a certain man
[26:02] made a great supper and beat many sent
[26:06] his servant at suppertime to say to them
[26:09] that will didn't come for all things are
[26:11] not ready they all would want us consent
[26:13] began to make excuse the first said unto
[26:16] him I have bought a piece of ground I
[26:18] must needs go and see it I pray they
[26:20] have an excuse another said I have
[26:22] bought five Ox yoke of oxen I go to
[26:25] prove them I pray thee have me excuse
[26:27] not I said I've married a wife like if I
[26:29] can come so that seven came showed us
[26:32] Lord these things then the master of the
[26:35] house being angry said unto his servant
[26:36] go out quickly into the streets Lanes of
[26:40] the city bringing hither the poor the
[26:43] meme the halt the blind the seven said
[26:47] Lord it is done was commanded and yet
[26:51] David's room and the Lord said unto that
[26:53] servant go out into the highways and
[26:55] hedges and compel them to come in that
[26:57] my house may be filled if I say unto you
[27:00] that none of those men which were bitten
[27:02] taste of my supper the next a
[27:06] translation of that or next scripture
[27:08] the same thing he said they were not
[27:10] worthy
[27:12] a reading from Matthew chapter 27
[27:15] reading verse 11. and Jesus stood before
[27:18] the governor
[27:19] and asked him saying and the governor
[27:23] asked him saying a thou the king of the
[27:26] Jews and Jesus said unto him downstairs
[27:29] when he was accused of the chief priest
[27:32] and Elders he answered nothing
[27:34] and said piloted to him here is thou not
[27:36] how many things do you witness against
[27:38] him he answered them never would and so
[27:41] much that the governor marveled greatly
[27:43] now that that Feast the governor was one
[27:46] to release unto the people a prisoner
[27:47] whom they would and they had then a
[27:49] notable prisoner called Barabbas
[27:52] therefore when they were gathered
[27:54] together pilate said unto them whom will
[27:56] you that I release unto you rob us or
[28:00] Jesus which is called Christ for he knew
[28:03] that for Envy they had delivered him
[28:06] and when he was sat down on the Judgment
[28:08] seat his wife sent unto him saying have
[28:11] thou nothing to do with that just man
[28:13] for I have suffered many things this day
[28:16] in a dream because of him
[28:18] but the chief priest and the eldest
[28:20] persuaded the multitude that they should
[28:22] ask about Barabbas and Destroy Jesus
[28:25] the governor answered and said unto them
[28:27] wither of the twin will he that I
[28:29] release unto you they said Barabbas the
[28:32] parrots said unto them what shall I do
[28:35] then with Jesus which is called Christ
[28:38] this all said unto him let him be
[28:41] crucified
[28:42] and the governor said why what evil had
[28:45] he done but they cried all the more
[28:47] saying let him be crucified
[28:50] and when pilate saw that he could
[28:52] Prevail nothing
[28:54] but that rather a too much was made he
[28:56] took water
[28:57] wash his hands before the multitude
[28:59] scene I'm innocent of the blood of this
[29:03] just person see you to it then the
[29:05] answered all the people and said his
[29:07] blood
[29:08] be on us and our children
[29:12] then release he Barabbas unto them and
[29:15] when he had scored Jesus he delivered
[29:17] him to be crucified
[29:19] than the soldiers of the governor took
[29:20] Jesus into the common Hall and got unto
[29:23] him the whole band of soldiers and they
[29:26] stripped him and put on him a Scarlet
[29:30] robe let's pray father we read your word
[29:32] tonight and I pray that your spiritual
[29:35] take and ride your word into the hearts
[29:37] and lives of your children in Jesus
[29:39] might ask amen God bless you you may be
[29:41] seated
[29:50] a
[29:53] what shall
[29:55] I do I was thinking about titling this
[29:57] message that we what shall I do but I
[30:00] put with Jesus on Your Hands what will
[30:01] you do
[30:02] and it's what will I do what will we do
[30:04] as individuals with Jesus on Your Hands
[30:07] what will you do
[30:08] what will you do
[30:09] oh let's go we see what the Lord will do
[30:11] tonight
[30:12] I won't appreciate brother Anthony's
[30:14] National profit service on Sunday what a
[30:17] message
[30:18] I was a masterpiece of a message I so
[30:20] was so blessed I told but Anthony that
[30:22] was the greatest message he didn't
[30:24] preached it was so solid it was so full
[30:27] of stuff in it it was inspirational to
[30:30] see how he has grown and his ministry is
[30:32] growing and I'm happy for him I really
[30:34] thank God for him tonight amen God has
[30:36] blessed us with some fine gifts Fine
[30:38] Brothers amen praise the Lord God bless
[30:40] you brother Anthony certainly love and
[30:42] appreciate you
[30:44] put a brown
[30:47] what we need today
[30:50] is an inspiration over us
[30:53] God sweeping down with a new inspiration
[30:58] and breathing over us his power
[31:01] and his love
[31:03] and himself that it might Inspire us
[31:07] to Quicken us and to weaken us to his
[31:12] word
[31:13] and then the word here we go being
[31:17] brought into that Spirit of inspiration
[31:22] then you will see miracles happen
[31:24] and things take place because the two
[31:27] just come together
[31:29] let me read it again
[31:31] what we need today is an inspiration
[31:33] over us the issue is not the books and
[31:36] the tips and the Bible and the word and
[31:37] they're not the issue you know this year
[31:40] is the issue the inspiration to come
[31:43] over us God's sweeping down who's
[31:45] sweeping down I thought a minister
[31:47] bringing something no God's sweeping
[31:49] down with a new inspiration breeding
[31:53] over us his power
[31:56] his love himself
[31:58] that it might Inspire us
[32:01] to Quicken us and waking us up this word
[32:05] sometimes I preach about the spirit
[32:07] equipment if they take the spirit to
[32:10] quickness isn't that right and he said
[32:13] no so that's one part then the word now
[32:16] being brought into that Spirit of
[32:19] inspiration
[32:20] oh so that means the word could be
[32:23] brought without that Spirit of
[32:24] inspiration correct but when the word is
[32:27] brought into the speed of inspiration
[32:28] then you will see miracles happen
[32:31] and things take place because the two
[32:34] just comes together because they give
[32:35] the laws on praises
[32:37] amen
[32:39] when that last struggle of our life
[32:42] comes
[32:43] and death rattles are in our truth
[32:47] we still must Hold Steady
[32:50] and remember that God said I'll raise
[32:53] you up again
[32:54] in the last days
[32:56] that must be our testimony our place in
[33:00] Christ our position what we are knowing
[33:03] that we have kept every word of his
[33:04] Commandments blessing a day to do his
[33:06] Commandments that they have the right to
[33:08] enter in see when we know that no matter
[33:11] what anyone has said we have kept every
[33:14] Commandment that we see in the Bible
[33:16] with reverence and love and respect to
[33:19] the Creator who wrote the Bible you see
[33:21] God in all his wisdom and omnipotence he
[33:24] wrote the Bible
[33:26] true men there is no mistakes there's no
[33:29] errors because he know every word will
[33:31] be written every road to be spoken men
[33:34] have all moved by the spirit depend
[33:37] those words and we can rest our souls on
[33:41] the Eternal Word of God even Jesus
[33:43] himself found himself resting on the
[33:45] word he said destroy this body and Jesus
[33:47] I raise up myself because he knew what
[33:50] David said and Daniel saw my books what
[33:52] Jeremiah said they looked at each other
[33:54] because it was the word coming from God
[33:57] and course enough Vindicated last day
[33:59] Prophet people lie on him and say what
[34:01] kind of thing about him but that doesn't
[34:03] change who he is and doesn't change who
[34:05] we we are and they will see for
[34:07] themselves when they see our hearts turn
[34:10] back literally back to the faith of the
[34:12] fathers all who says they are liars and
[34:17] understand that they are lying we will
[34:18] vindicate Malachi for we will send me
[34:21] King what God have said this last day we
[34:23] will prove this message it's not a hoax
[34:25] it's not a fake it is real it is to say
[34:28] the Lord or could we get a lot of shout
[34:31] I became the host the whole of Hell come
[34:33] against it it still can't change it
[34:35] Jesus said my whole glory to God he said
[34:38] heaven will pass away but my word will
[34:40] never pass away oh is it worth the
[34:43] Eternal thoughts of God isn't that right
[34:46] you receive man wrote it man of old
[34:48] moved by the Holy Ghost wrote it you see
[34:51] God rooted through men
[34:53] like a prophet speaks his word is not
[34:55] the prophet's word it is God's word to
[34:58] that prophet and that's the reason has
[35:00] come it has to come to pass it is truly
[35:03] the truth we see this great man and
[35:06] remember job now had no bible to read in
[35:08] this day he only went by inspiration he
[35:12] was a prophet to whom the word of the
[35:13] Lord comes to he had only to be inspired
[35:16] because he knowed his position that he
[35:19] was God's Prophet the only thing that
[35:21] had to happen was for the inspiration to
[35:23] strike him and then he knowed what he
[35:26] said would happen because it was by
[35:29] inspiration
[35:30] and that's the church
[35:31] so he's talking about Joe being in a
[35:33] channel knowing his position just
[35:36] waiting for inspiration knowing that
[35:38] what he said by inspiration will come to
[35:40] pass then he said that's the church
[35:42] watch watch if it's in order
[35:46] set an order so there's a prophecy
[35:48] hanging over the church to be set in
[35:50] order all the cuckoo all the mistakes
[35:53] all the gaps all the things that lead to
[35:54] be placed correctly it could be set in
[35:56] order because a prophecy for concerning
[35:58] that that is why they choose Matthias
[36:00] because Judas fell and they bring it at
[36:03] number 11 but they had to get number 12.
[36:04] so that's why they had to get my tasks
[36:06] in position before when the day of
[36:09] Pentecost was fully come so before
[36:11] Dynamics struck the hard was to select
[36:13] Matas in that position to have a 12th
[36:16] man
[36:16] oh Chloe they've got to set the church
[36:18] in order before the Fire Fall so God
[36:21] have to set the church in order from the
[36:23] pulpit to the back bench the entire
[36:25] church has to be set in order it has to
[36:28] start somewhere and tonight it starts
[36:30] with your heart or give the Lord some
[36:32] praises
[36:34] Oh Glory to God and that's the church if
[36:37] it's set in order it's only got the
[36:39] mechanics ready it's got the mechanics
[36:42] ready it only needs then the Dynamics

[37:18] you to do oh glory to God hallelujah you

[38:52] important statement now he job had a
[38:55] Channel of communication to God that he
[38:57] got by inspiration he had a way of
[39:01] moving himself out and letting God move
[39:03] in
[39:04] and he knew he was justified it was a
[39:08] gift it was a gift for the people not
[39:10] for job but for the people all Divine
[39:14] gifts are to serve God's people with
[39:18] or could he give the Lord some praises
[39:20] Oh Glory to God

[39:24] manners always make try to make excuses
[39:26] but to receive not to receive God's word
[39:28] of his invitation though it is firmly
[39:30] proven to them and it says supper his
[39:33] invitation but man is constantly making
[39:35] excuses now watch when God gives a man
[39:39] an invitation to do something to do
[39:42] something to receive the invitation
[39:44] that's given to him and he turns it down
[39:47] there's nothing left after Mercy is
[39:49] spoon but judgment
[39:51] if you step over the boundaries of Mercy
[39:53] there's only one thing left that's
[39:54] judgment it happened every age of the
[39:56] Bible when God shall know his silver
[39:58] made a way of Escape for all the people
[40:00] who wanted to be saved but the people
[40:01] need laughing at Noah but God made a way
[40:04] but they had an excuse it wasn't a

[41:11] they would they were given they wouldn't
[41:13] be as they are today two thousand years
[41:16] ago Israel turned on the invitation to
[41:19] come to the wedding supper they turned
[41:21] it on and went to the judgment and Jesus
[41:23] said they stoned and killed the prophets
[41:25] that was sent to them by making excuses
[41:28] and there's excuses they're making each
[41:30] day we find out

[42:09] were so convinced they take the blood of
[42:11] Jesus they may be upon us and our
[42:13] children that were convinced they were
[42:14] right but they were wrong oh praise the
[42:17] name of the Lord Jesus was trying to
[42:19] tell them that their excuses what killed
[42:21] the prophets what killed the righteous
[42:23] they accepted the Creeds that men has
[42:25] given them instead of taking the word of
[42:28] God and today instead of people take

[42:37] Spirit tell them some dream tell them
[42:39] they're taking everything else but what
[42:41] the prophet said and what the Bible said
[42:43] because what the prophet said and the

[45:51] what it's supposed to be just take it
[45:54] the way it said it it is wrote down here

[47:21] same Russia you're talking about all
[47:22] them bombs and nuclear bombs Holy Ghost
[47:24] fell on them give the Lord a shout we
[47:27] are talking about evangelists and

[47:47] gone the churches can't have church only
[47:49] under permission they are doomed in the
[47:52] Judgment has gone over to the wild
[47:54] tangent of Communism solo to the devil
[47:56] so the rejection of the Holy was in
[47:58] Russia brought the Communist spirit
[48:00] upon them they can help it they are
[48:03] inspired they anointed and we have to
[48:06] come to the place where we can't help it
[48:08] we are inspired and we anointed by the
[48:11] holy ghost that Russia rejected that the
[48:13] world rejected that the church had
[48:15] rejected that denomination rejected we
[48:17] have to be anointed and inspired by the
[48:20] Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that fell
[48:22] under their Pentecost the same holy
[48:24] ghost that Paul had the same holy ghost
[48:27] that Peter had the same Olivers that the
[48:29] richest had
[48:31] together
[48:35] 50 years ago Holy Ghost fell in England

[48:57] they'd lost their minds the churches
[48:58] refused the people to come to hear them
[49:00] they healed the sick the castle Devil's
[49:02] done great works and because England as
[49:04] a nation rejected the gospel her sins is
[49:06] no true to all the world the holidays
[49:08] are more Apostles nation in all the
[49:10] world even including Roman France than
[49:12] England

[49:15] Finney and many of the Great Men
[49:17] preached thinning and Wesleyan they turn
[49:20] it down and tonight the reason this
[49:22] nation is doomed there's no hope for it
[49:25] at all she's crossed the line between
[49:26] judgment and mercy talk about America
[49:28] she's elected what she has there to
[49:30] control the nation she's rotten to the
[49:32] core of politics is rotten morals and
[49:34] Nations alone or anything I can think of
[49:36] and I really the system is written under
[49:37] the morals she becomes in doing this she
[49:40] now join us with all these churches and
[49:42] the Nations to the Federation of
[49:44] churches and has taken the mark of the

[50:08] of fathers dropped down under the day of
[50:10] Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was

[51:52] Ghost for the last time there's nothing
[51:53] they can do you know

[52:38] drink it you know what I mean this is
[52:40] eternal life and to refuse to do it one

[52:43] judgment and mercy and you won't have
[52:45] the privilege to come and receive it now
[52:47] watch
[52:48] some kind of excuse it's too hot I'm too
[52:51] tired I will tomorrow just some kind of
[52:54] by rejecting their visitation it
[52:56] separates you from God now notice in the
[52:58] Old Testament it had Jubilee and the
[53:00] Jubilee you could go free if there was
[53:02] some with excuse he could give he didn't
[53:04] want to return to his land then he had
[53:06] to be marked in the air with an all by
[53:08] the post in the temple and then no
[53:10] matter so in other words he could go
[53:12] free you know price paid trumpet song
[53:15] but you love your master
[53:17] Hallelujah I love what controlling you
[53:19] you love what they reckon you and
[53:21] hitting you and striking you do this do
[53:22] this you're lucky you're falling over
[53:24] the master
[53:25] and you have your own land
[53:28] you have your own family to go back to
[53:30] what happened Boya is isn't that right
[53:32] and they watch the death for slavery is
[53:34] over his family was free he could go
[53:36] right back to his homeland get his own
[53:38] possession but if he refused to do it
[53:40] then he wasn't locked no more with
[53:41] Israel his possession was given to
[53:44] another the same thing in the natural
[53:46] applies to the spiritual we as
[53:48] inheritance of eternal life and we hear
[53:51] the gospel I know it's true and we
[53:53] reject it and refuse to do it or listen
[53:55] to it we take the mark of the beast
[53:57] Hallelujah take the mark of the beast
[53:59] get his bum now somebody said no there's
[54:02] going to be a mark of the beast is going

[54:26] as the Holy Ghost began to fall

[54:34] to accept it take the Seal of God to
[54:35] reject it take the mark of the beast to
[54:37] reject the seed of God is to take the
[54:39] mark of the beast so he ties it all
[54:41] together the seed is presented rejecting
[54:43] Mark taking

[54:48] something on the credit card and some
[54:51] kind of number you're not looking for
[54:52] that you know there's a word here no
[54:53] this is the interpretation in the market
[54:55] division the seed of God comes as an
[54:57] offer as I invite reject that take the
[55:01] mark
[55:03] waiting to be judged so the word come as
[55:06] an offer a word offer

[56:01] explain that
[56:04] you don't need a three-hour sermon to
[56:07] explain that you don't need an
[56:09] interpretation of some intellectual come
[56:11] to explain the depth of that it is very
[56:13] straightforward it is very simple grieve
[56:16] not the Holy Spirit whereby you are
[56:18] sealed until the day of redemption
[56:20] Oh Glory to God to reject the seed of
[56:23] God is to take the mark of the beast for

[1:11:46] sinned and come short of the glory but
[1:11:48] God reached Mercy Oh Glory to God God
[1:11:52] reaching Mercy oh he is here tonight to
[1:11:55] deliver to redeem to heal to save to
[1:12:00] baptize to inspire to anoint
[1:12:03] oh my Hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:12:08] oh let's continue
[1:12:11] watch the rejected the Messiah and then
[1:12:13] today is the same thing the very same
[1:12:15] thing we have been given an opportunity
[1:12:17] because God cannot judge this this blew
[1:12:20] my mind out without being justified for
[1:12:23] his judgment
[1:12:26] so God hold himself to high standard in
[1:12:29] order to judge
[1:12:32] that is going to judge Nineveh send
[1:12:35] Jonah take all our hearts chapter and
[1:12:38] everybody will never repent and God
[1:12:40] canceled the judgment and Jonah in
[1:12:42] trouble
[1:12:43] do not open because you expect God to do
[1:12:45] this and God to do that and go to that
[1:12:47] he said oh God God said well God repent
[1:12:50] are they cancel that one
[1:12:53] because you wish you all come to
[1:12:54] repentance
[1:12:57] you see if you you say if you're if a
[1:12:59] certain person
[1:13:00] you stop them and say there's a hole in
[1:13:02] the road down there if you continue that
[1:13:05] speed you'll be killed they say nonsense
[1:13:07] I know what I'm doing you see the blood
[1:13:09] can't be upon your hand because you have
[1:13:11] warned them but God does the same thing
[1:13:13] by his word he thoroughly warns the
[1:13:15] people of uncommon judgment shows his
[1:13:17] signs wonders predicted in the Bible for
[1:13:19] the age he shows them people just walk
[1:13:21] right over it it's not easy for a person
[1:13:23] to go to hell a man fights his way to
[1:13:25] Hell the first lie ever told the first
[1:13:28] wrong first cigarette ever smoke you
[1:13:29] know it was wrong the first evil your
[1:13:31] dead Universe wrong but in your
[1:13:32] conscience told it was wrong and you
[1:13:34] continue to run through the red light
[1:13:35] over the barricade this is probably
[1:13:38] going to get to remember you fight your
[1:13:40] way to hell it is not easy to go to hell
[1:13:43] you have to reject truth
[1:13:47] you're coming deep into that tonight
[1:13:48] because this is a thing I thought that I
[1:13:50] never presented that way before never
[1:13:52] see that before
[1:13:54] no beef oh okay so now that they take
[1:13:57] Barabbas right they had to accept that
[1:14:00] man Barabbas to reject Christ
[1:14:06] the offer was Barabbas or Christ which
[1:14:09] one of these two everybody knows record
[1:14:11] I mean making newspaper already the man
[1:14:15] was sentenced already didn't know his
[1:14:16] reputation he's a murderer he's a
[1:14:18] vagabond he's abandoned he's an
[1:14:20] independent Society nobody wanted and
[1:14:22] then them religious people will give us
[1:14:24] Bara
[1:14:26] Barabas
[1:14:29] and before any man a woman can accept
[1:14:32] wrong
[1:14:34] this is deep it always sees already but
[1:14:36] boy they said they have to reject right
[1:14:40] there is something about nature it got
[1:14:42] allotted you have to reject the right
[1:14:45] thing
[1:14:46] before you can receive the wrong thing
[1:14:50] so when you see people on the wrong side
[1:14:51] of this thing you recognize they reject
[1:14:53] the right thing
[1:14:54] because God kind of get you writing to
[1:14:56] the people
[1:14:57] now watch
[1:14:59] I have quoted to to keep you from
[1:15:02] telling a lie you told a lie against
[1:15:04] your better judgment you tell a lie
[1:15:06] against your conscience you told a lie
[1:15:08] against what your mother or parents
[1:15:09] taught you to do or even native self
[1:15:11] teachers you shouldn't do it so
[1:15:12] therefore you have to reject truth to
[1:15:15] accept a lie you have to reach up truth
[1:15:17] before you can accept the LIE see
[1:15:20] so then I tend this
[1:15:24] the reverse is also true
[1:15:27] you have to reject the LIE before you
[1:15:30] can accept the truth
[1:15:38] fornication unclean living must be
[1:15:40] rejected
[1:15:42] before you can accept the right way of
[1:15:44] living
[1:15:44] you can't have it both ways
[1:15:50] so the compromise Javier limbo
[1:15:53] because you have not rejected the lie or
[1:15:56] rejected that is of the word or reject
[1:15:58] this is not what God wants and you can
[1:16:00] accept God's word you're trying to
[1:16:02] bridge the gap
[1:16:03] trying to walk with two things
[1:16:06] can't work
[1:16:10] notice
[1:16:11] do you get that tonight
[1:16:13] the reverse is also true
[1:16:16] you have to reject the liar
[1:16:20] before you can accept the truth or
[1:16:23] embrace the truth or connect with the
[1:16:25] truth you have to disconnect from life
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:30] pull the plug on lies
[1:16:33] pull the plug on what is not beneficial
[1:16:35] what is not edifying what is not
[1:16:38] inspiring Paul said it this way
[1:16:40] whatsoever things are lovely what some
[1:16:42] things are true whatever things are good
[1:16:44] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:16:47] may be prayers think on these things
[1:16:48] these things
[1:16:52] is this the word we're preaching tonight
[1:16:53] is this the Bible
[1:16:55] all right now the church has to turn his
[1:16:58] word down first
[1:17:00] and after the church turned it down and
[1:17:04] call him belzebub or evil spirit then it
[1:17:06] was brought to the government
[1:17:10] reject the bride the bride will be
[1:17:13] Joseph the rejected he said damn they
[1:17:16] find fault with the man who was the word
[1:17:18] now they find fault with the word
[1:17:20] working through the man
[1:17:22] oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:17:24] glory to God the bride going to be
[1:17:26] rejected when the bride become
[1:17:28] manifested oh give the Lord a shout help
[1:17:31] me Jesus do you get that tonight
[1:17:37] a prophet like not true all Israel is
[1:17:41] not Israel two million people came out
[1:17:43] but two only two went in like Joshua
[1:17:45] Caleb so bright had to be identified
[1:17:48] I am right I am the irony bride and I
[1:17:51] catchphrases and stuff like foolishness
[1:17:53] I just words there's just a man talking
[1:17:55] when the bride is identified which which
[1:17:58] I'm preaching it already you have to be
[1:18:01] the word manifested to be the bride
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:07] the word manifested so therefore you
[1:18:10] have a passion that's what you should
[1:18:12] have a passion to strive to become the
[1:18:15] word manifested Oh Glory to God Amen he
[1:18:19] said what they call him watch oh so
[1:18:20] let's say it again so after the church
[1:18:22] turned it down calling belzebub or an
[1:18:24] evil spirit then it was brought before
[1:18:26] the government so that the whole race
[1:18:28] had to become them what did they reject
[1:18:30] many of them wanted to believe but the
[1:18:33] Traditions not the people but the
[1:18:35] Traditions they are so undocumented with
[1:18:38] the system so the time are we going good
[1:18:41] they were so so in document with the
[1:18:43] system it isn't the person it's the
[1:18:45] system it isn't the people it's the
[1:18:46] system it wasn't the Jews it was their
[1:18:48] system so after 50 plus years of this
[1:18:51] message men have built systems
[1:18:55] systems that's where they have systems
[1:18:57] it's just describing Pharisees and
[1:18:58] services they build systems the people
[1:19:00] are locked into a system
[1:19:03] so even though they hear truth outside
[1:19:05] their system they can't accept it
[1:19:06] because they connect to their system and
[1:19:09] they love the system Oh Glory to God
[1:19:11] they love the system God sent a prophet
[1:19:13] you know you have words here you know
[1:19:14] but men pushing back the words even
[1:19:17] recently here a man say you don't need a
[1:19:18] Bible not in this message but you say
[1:19:20] you don't need the Bible and you don't
[1:19:22] need to read the Bible when you when
[1:19:24] they come to the Lord God will talk to
[1:19:25] direct
[1:19:26] a demon talking here then Lucifer agent
[1:19:30] tonight Lucifer there you know
[1:19:32] you know when GSA many foreign
[1:19:57] and guess
[1:19:59] so sometimes we come to pass I'll make
[1:20:00] the past Spirit tell them things
[1:20:03] oh
[1:20:04] help me Jesus
[1:20:06] this is wood
[1:20:08] all right so is isn't the people it's
[1:20:11] the system it isn't the Jews it's the
[1:20:13] system the system condemning because it
[1:20:16] didn't tolerate with their system and
[1:20:18] there's a difference between the mark of
[1:20:20] the beast and the ceiling of God
[1:20:24] are you ready
[1:20:26] oh here we go God seals by his word
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:32] but if we stop right there be in trouble
[1:20:35] God intellectual say what's my word oh
[1:20:37] God that mystery that preached last
[1:20:39] night
[1:20:40] no not just yet not just yet all right
[1:20:43] now this is true because you say my
[1:20:45] words are spirit and life
[1:20:47] you're the prophet bring it now go on
[1:20:49] seals by his word you believe the word
[1:20:53] is but you see is that right yes sir
[1:20:56] then he called Ephesians 4 30 grieve not
[1:20:58] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:21:00] sealed on the day of your Redemption now
[1:21:03] the holy spirit is the word
[1:21:04] hahaha
[1:21:08] oh my God I love it I love it I love it
[1:21:10] love it you see that he said God sees by
[1:21:12] his word and then he bring now green for
[1:21:13] the Holy Spirit baby I see you he said
[1:21:15] holy spirit
[1:21:17] God is Not tree he's the same God in
[1:21:20] tree dispensation three offices God the
[1:21:22] Father over the jaw God the son in Grace
[1:21:24] God the Holy Ghost as you call it the
[1:21:27] same God in the Holy Ghost dispensation
[1:21:29] God the father was the word God the son
[1:21:31] was the word and God the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:34] the word see it's just three offices and
[1:21:37] the Holy Ghost therefore seals you
[1:21:39] therefore you are sealed by the word you
[1:21:41] hear that equation when you add up all
[1:21:43] that I can put the equal sign you are
[1:21:45] sealed by the word Oh Glory the gods of
[1:21:47] us you are seen by the word and put it
[1:21:49] this way now that we're turning in the
[1:21:50] spirit inside of you and that's the
[1:21:52] kingdom inside of you behold the kingdom
[1:21:54] is within you oh Glory the God don't go
[1:21:56] low here low there go here go there go
[1:21:58] there oh glory to God do we do that
[1:22:00] tonight
[1:22:02] belong to a system and be sealed with
[1:22:06] the system Underwood
[1:22:08] so anytime somebody gets a revelation
[1:22:10] and they recognize their system there
[1:22:11] they get out because the word don't
[1:22:13] agree with system
[1:22:14] because systems are built around the
[1:22:16] world oh glory to God systems cannot be
[1:22:19] the word it's built around the world but
[1:22:22] the bride will be the word itself so
[1:22:24] when God put in your spirit the
[1:22:26] revelation of you becoming the word
[1:22:28] itself when you hear the word that you
[1:22:29] were talking about that's your name
[1:22:31] we're talking about system cabanu
[1:22:35] foreign Oh Glory to God you can't belong
[1:22:39] to a system and be sealed with the
[1:22:41] system and the word see because it's
[1:22:43] contrary one to the other you can't do
[1:22:45] it
[1:22:46] you see the machine but automobile it
[1:22:48] got Pistons valves carburetor and so
[1:22:50] forth that's the mechanics I like to say
[1:22:52] something to the church right here
[1:22:53] brings in my memory see I believe we are
[1:22:56] so close now I'm gonna say something now
[1:22:58] see the mechanics
[1:23:00] he's emphasizing there are so many
[1:23:03] people trying to explain the mechanics
[1:23:06] when you don't know it
[1:23:09] you hear me say what I hear funeral
[1:23:11] services
[1:23:12] on the other side
[1:23:14] and a lot of details I've got another
[1:23:17] problem there you know because they have
[1:23:19] never been there
[1:23:20] I don't mind your passing through you
[1:23:22] know
[1:23:22] but but but you can't go too deep
[1:23:25] you can't explain you know I mean the
[1:23:27] the pavement in the city of gold and the
[1:23:29] streets of gold have they repeat that
[1:23:30] right on this side and brown on this
[1:23:32] side you cargo there
[1:23:33] ain't gonna go in there in trouble
[1:23:35] because have you been there you cross
[1:23:36] over you get what's up from the fellas
[1:23:38] who cross on your side you get a text oh
[1:23:41] you know we're going on another side you
[1:23:43] know what they're doing
[1:23:46] what kind of foolishness is that
[1:23:48] bringing back a revelation on the other
[1:23:50] side
[1:23:52] wow
[1:23:53] all right if a Prophet come and testify
[1:23:55] like how we talk about his wife and and
[1:23:58] and
[1:23:58] his vision of his wife and someone like
[1:24:01] that because that's different
[1:24:02] but us here forget it all right I'm
[1:24:05] gonna say something there are so many
[1:24:07] people trying to explain the mechanics
[1:24:10] when you don't know it
[1:24:14] suppose somebody said Noah I want to
[1:24:15] explain the mechanics of how I flute he
[1:24:17] couldn't do it
[1:24:18] you don't have to know the mechanics
[1:24:22] I wonder how much people believe that
[1:24:24] Brother Andy you don't have to know the
[1:24:27] mechanics but the Dynamics of it
[1:24:33] I don't have to nobody driveshaft any
[1:24:35] connected the engine and and and and and
[1:24:37] and and
[1:24:44] the
[1:24:45] condenser and the plugs I'm not a
[1:24:49] mechanic
[1:24:50] all I want to know the engine tumbling
[1:24:53] and the car four wheels
[1:24:55] there no harm mechanics there no a lot
[1:24:58] of power you know just engine making
[1:24:59] noise you know is that going nowhere and
[1:25:01] you have an engine but
[1:25:03] no you want the whole car
[1:25:06] with the engine in it that people's body
[1:25:08] and wheels and things
[1:25:10] and they can still then take pictures of
[1:25:12] behind the wheel but they're not going
[1:25:13] anywhere a bicycle could pass them they
[1:25:15] have no engine inside the deer there's
[1:25:16] no power inside of there you need all
[1:25:18] together you need the whole vehicle with
[1:25:21] the engine with the battery with the
[1:25:23] power but everything's out of there when
[1:25:25] the bright start off you might be a
[1:25:27] rumble devil must get smoke in his face
[1:25:29] when we're leaving here oh glory to God
[1:25:31] when we start that Raptor Express when
[1:25:34] we cut on an engine here oh glory to God
[1:25:36] we have to at least smoke and the
[1:25:38] devil's face as we take off Glory
[1:25:41] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:25:42] Give the Lord some praises
[1:25:46] Hallelujah
[1:25:47] glory to God listen to this song Moses
[1:25:50] might have known the mechanics but it
[1:25:52] wasn't anybody else business anybody has
[1:25:55] placed to understand it but Moses he
[1:25:57] said you don't he said is it him you
[1:25:59] don't have to know the mechanics
[1:26:05] that makes it true praise the name of
[1:26:07] the Lord see they've got the mechanics
[1:26:09] the only thing they have is okay I'll
[1:26:11] skip you though he said they all have
[1:26:13] arrived that that big machine that set
[1:26:16] up there talking about the United
[1:26:17] Nations they've got the mechanics the
[1:26:20] only thing they have to get is Satan in
[1:26:22] there with the Dynamics to force the
[1:26:24] magnet of the Beast so even United
[1:26:26] Nations written Dynamics and they might
[1:26:28] have it already what kind of foolish is
[1:26:30] that nonsense the United Nations waiting
[1:26:33] on their Dynamics which is Lucifer
[1:26:35] coming in them as rain to enforce laws
[1:26:37] to put the squeeze upon the bride oh God
[1:26:40] but then can't get Dynamics first you
[1:26:42] ever see that before
[1:26:52] the devil didn't move when them demons
[1:26:55] reported back to hell that look they're
[1:26:57] staggering and they excited and sit and
[1:26:59] said I'm excited man leave them alone
[1:27:01] they're having a good time praise God
[1:27:02] Jesus done dead and gone already he's
[1:27:04] having a good time but when Peter went
[1:27:06] to they get caught beautiful and I kept
[1:27:08] my man that everybody know was there and
[1:27:09] he said sir Van Gogh Have I None
[1:27:11] structures have I give it unto you rise
[1:27:13] up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:15] when them Devils went and tell Satan you
[1:27:17] know what happened a man walked by a
[1:27:19] crippled pork it's like Jesus come back
[1:27:20] again it's not one Jesus as many Jesus
[1:27:22] is or give the Lord I shout in the house
[1:27:25] glory to God that's him Jesus living in
[1:27:29] Peter living in John living in Paul
[1:27:31] living in James Give the Lord some
[1:27:33] praises then they bring the Press on
[1:27:35] them I said licks
[1:27:37] blows they beat them Hallelujah I said
[1:27:41] Don't Preach no more in Jesus name we
[1:27:43] want to see nonetheless happen again
[1:27:47] go back upstairs and make a noise but
[1:27:48] don't come and do things like that and
[1:27:50] when them fellas went back day they say
[1:27:52] Lord God who acts for now said no your
[1:27:55] power that we could go out and testify
[1:27:58] and while they were praying they were
[1:28:00] filled all over again we call it a
[1:28:02] resilient of the Holy Ghost what they
[1:28:04] had in Acts 2 they come back and get the
[1:28:06] next portion in Acts four they must get
[1:28:08] in portioned upon portions upon portion
[1:28:10] Oh Glory they refilled with the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost went backward and bust that word
[1:28:15] fresh right open again Lord there was a
[1:28:17] liar tonight
[1:28:19] glory to God is not right let me say
[1:28:22] something I believe the pride of Christ
[1:28:23] is called I believe she is sealed into
[1:28:25] the kingdom of God all in his prophecy I
[1:28:27] believe the mechanic is here they are
[1:28:29] waiting for the Dynamics they are
[1:28:31] waiting for what
[1:28:32] they are waiting for what some man from
[1:28:35] America they're waiting for what it's a
[1:28:37] man from England no they are waiting for
[1:28:39] Dynamics
[1:28:40] oh give the Lord a shout glory to God
[1:28:46] no they're waiting for
[1:28:49] Dynamics Hallelujah that will take her
[1:28:52] off the earth into glory in the Rapture
[1:28:54] I deliver with all my heart we don't
[1:28:56] know how he's going to do it but he
[1:28:58] shall do it here's why here's why you
[1:29:01] ready he is the Dynamics
[1:29:03] I want to connect to him
[1:29:05] Oh Glory to God I want to know him
[1:29:07] I want to connect to him because he is a
[1:29:10] Dynamics we become members of the
[1:29:12] machine of his body
[1:29:14] forming ourselves into His Image what's
[1:29:18] his image fate virtue knowledge
[1:29:20] Temperance patience godliness badly
[1:29:23] kindness and love of God we have to form
[1:29:26] ourselves into His Image oh give the

[1:32:34] rejected
[1:32:35] the spirit
[1:32:36] rejected
[1:32:41] now wow
[1:32:46] mother Eve corrupted the whole earth
[1:32:48] into physical debt listen mother Eve
[1:32:50] corrupted the whole Human Race by
[1:32:52] physical death how by rejecting the word
[1:32:55] and accepting something almost like it
[1:32:58] she caused all physical debt because she
[1:33:00] left the true word and believed the true
[1:33:02] word all but just a little bit
[1:33:05] one little disagreement
[1:33:08] full word of God cause every heartache
[1:33:10] every death everything here I mean Earth
[1:33:12] Eve done the mother of death you see
[1:33:15] where we are coming the mother noticed
[1:33:17] she just released the word she said God
[1:33:19] had said Satan said that's right God I
[1:33:21] said that's right God has said that's
[1:33:22] right God has said yes that's exactly
[1:33:24] right that's what I've said but your
[1:33:27] eyes
[1:33:28] open
[1:33:29] but God has said in that that's supposed
[1:33:31] to settled the word it started with a
[1:33:34] little misconstruation of the word and
[1:33:36] the same thing it ended the same way
[1:33:38] notice a daughter is a product of mother
[1:33:41] and father by a union now here's
[1:33:44] something shocking
[1:33:45] debt physical debt is United of mother
[1:33:49] Eve and Satan together
[1:33:51] by disbelieving God's word
[1:33:54] they United and brought the product of
[1:33:56] debt debt is the product of United
[1:33:59] States and Eve together
[1:34:00] Eve had the word Satan is against the
[1:34:03] word and almost 99 and 99 hundreds of it
[1:34:06] Satan admitted was right
[1:34:08] watch so close the Bible said in the
[1:34:11] last days it will deceive the very
[1:34:12] latest possible
[1:34:14] the hope is going to be the same how
[1:34:16] it's going out the same way and this is
[1:34:17] a bomb here now
[1:34:20] uniting of unbelief
[1:34:23] in all the full word of God you got it
[1:34:26] that is what brought that
[1:34:29] is only in this message of the full word
[1:34:33] he's not talking about denomination he's
[1:34:35] not talking about Pentecostal and
[1:34:36] baptism Methodist he said uniting of
[1:34:39] unbelief with the full word produce debt
[1:34:44] so this letter killer this debting is
[1:34:46] not easy you know we're talking about
[1:34:48] spiritual debt people Concord in the
[1:34:50] pews
[1:34:52] dead in churches stoned
[1:34:55] on the way to meet up with the rest of
[1:34:57] the tribulation scenes
[1:34:59] it has no Rapture for that
[1:35:01] this is serious
[1:35:03] watch
[1:35:05] uniting of unbelief in all the full word
[1:35:09] of God you got it
[1:35:11] that is what brought debt it's United
[1:35:13] unbelief of the word
[1:35:15] unbelief just a little bitty part of it
[1:35:18] little bitty teeny bit 100 of one
[1:35:20] percent it must be 100 say 100 percent
[1:35:25] you have to receive the wood 100 percent
[1:35:27] here we go we almost done now God's
[1:35:30] daughter the church the bride
[1:35:32] is a product
[1:35:34] of God and his word United
[1:35:36] the holy spirit uniting in a body of
[1:35:38] flesh is produces Son of God It produced
[1:35:41] the righteousness of god let's get to
[1:35:43] the prophecy now but in the last days

[1:35:49] a Sodom the bride

[1:37:07] down they turned him down the dead I
[1:37:09] know I'm coming to the close now as he
[1:37:11] came then clearly identify himself to be
[1:37:13] the word it come down to our Showdown
[1:37:15] where they must choose the word or take
[1:37:17] the system and the same thing today you

[1:37:50] do but stand at the Judgment of God
[1:37:52] knowing what's going to happen to you
[1:37:54] what will I do with this Jesus called
[1:37:56] Christ pilate said nobody by now is
[1:37:59] going deeper Pilots he placed on his
[1:38:02] hands and the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:38:04] placed again on the hands of this
[1:38:06] congregation
[1:38:07] it is based on the hands of this nation
[1:38:09] around the world where these tips have
[1:38:11] been and things have been Vindicated and
[1:38:13] proved of God
[1:38:15] watch let's look when blood is on your
[1:38:18] hands man has to watch when he's got
[1:38:20] another man's blood on his hands look at
[1:38:22] an airplane a pilot out in a plane he
[1:38:25] runs that plane out he checks every
[1:38:27] instrument why he's got blood of
[1:38:29] somebody in his hands every little
[1:38:31] instrument can be checked he checks it
[1:38:34] and when the blood of somebody's on your
[1:38:36] hands every little instrument is check
[1:38:38] check and when he gets out and turns the
[1:38:40] plane rev the motor the engine and sees
[1:38:43] warmed up throw the chuckle all the way
[1:38:44] to see the blast and compel you you
[1:38:47] stood many of you in a plane sit down
[1:38:49] the whole plane shake off the ground he
[1:38:51] has given it all he's got is there
[1:38:54] anything out of line it will spit and
[1:38:56] Concord but he checks it again he sat
[1:38:58] there moment until he checks it again
[1:39:00] and again and they hold this time a
[1:39:02] little he checks it again
[1:39:04] hold the church here we go
[1:39:06] ought to be checking it again
[1:39:09] and again and again and again we are
[1:39:14] waiting for his coming we are waiting
[1:39:16] for takeoff we better check it with the
[1:39:18] word and I don't understand how people
[1:39:20] will Gamble and take another man's word
[1:39:23] it beats me it blows my mind and we have
[1:39:26] a Plumb line a prophet message that
[1:39:29] could drop the line under that fall
[1:39:31] where it fall the building has to line
[1:39:33] up at the Plumb Lane you can't shift the
[1:39:35] blend of the shoot the Plumb Lane or

[1:39:39] class shift the Plumb line right at the
[1:39:40] shoot the building
[1:39:41] the building of the lineup of the Plumb
[1:39:43] line he's got blood of the hand to the
[1:39:45] power of the check how about a doctor

[1:39:54] blood he want to check the heart he want
[1:39:56] to see if he got any coal before he give
[1:39:58] understanding he checks every instrument
[1:40:00] he boils them thoroughly they see
[1:40:02] there's no germs in it he does
[1:40:04] everything he checks over and over and
[1:40:05] over and over again why he's got blood
[1:40:07] in his hands what about you sinner what
[1:40:10] do you feel about it to have the blood
[1:40:12] of a man on your hand responsibility
