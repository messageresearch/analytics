[18:54] Anthony praise the Lord amen so we want
[18:58] turn our Bibles to Ephesians chapter
[19:13] 2 and we want to read from verse
[19:20] 11 wherefore remember that ye being in
[19:23] time pass Gentiles In the Flesh who are
[19:25] called un uncircumcision by that which
[19:28] is called the circumcision of the flesh
[19:30] made by hands that at the time you were
[19:33] without Christ being aliens from the
[19:36] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[19:39] from the Covenant of Promise having no
[19:42] hope without God in the world but now in
[19:47] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far
[19:50] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[19:54] for he is our peace who had made both
[19:57] one and had broken down the middle wall
[20:00] of partition between us having abolished
[20:04] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[20:06] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[20:10] to make himself of Twain one new man so
[20:13] making peace and that he might reconcile
[20:16] both unto God in one body by the cross
[20:20] having slain the enmity thereby and came
[20:24] and preached peace to you which were a
[20:26] far off to them that were nigh for
[20:30] through him we both have access by one
[20:35] Spirit unto the
[20:38] father now therefore ye are no more
[20:41] strangers and
[20:43] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[20:46] Saints and of the household of God and
[20:49] are built upon the foundation of the
[20:52] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[20:54] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[20:57] whom all the the building fitly framed
[21:00] together grow it unto an Holy Temple in
[21:03] the Lord in whom ye are buil together
[21:07] for a habitation of God through the
[21:09] spirit let's pray father we thank you
[21:11] for your word and a few uh thoughts to
[21:15] share with your people before the

[21:49] seated oh praise the name of the Lord
[21:51] well greetings in Jesus name amen as
[21:54] always it's a privilege to be here in
[21:56] the house of God Amen
[22:03] well praise the lord it's a blessing to
[22:05] be here and uh we want to even welcome
[22:08] those who are connected with us this
[22:09] morning on the internet want to say
[22:11] greetings and God bless you so we are
[22:14] looking for a wonderful time in the Lord
[22:17] amen so I trust you were blessed last
[22:19] Sunday Hallelujah that Ephesian
[22:22] bride comes into view there's a picture
[22:27] that you have to see amen of what God
[22:29] requires of us because we still fighting
[22:32] up with church membership hallelujah
[22:34] it's a
[22:35] battle
[22:37] church
[22:39] membership and I believe it was
[22:41] identifying that part of Ephesians that
[22:44] I was talking about uh last Sunday you
[22:47] are no longer strangers but you are
[22:50] fellow
[22:51] citizens of the household of the
[22:54] saintsall so I was doing some studies
[22:57] and I was looking at the Amplified of
[23:01] that scripture and I want to read it for
[23:02] you this morning what Paul was saying
[23:05] here in
[23:06] Ephesians okay listen
[23:11] carefully
[23:13] therefore this is verse 19 in the
[23:15] Amplified you are no longer
[23:19] Outsiders Exile migrants and
[23:23] Aliens excluded from the rights of
[23:27] citizens but you you now share
[23:30] citizenship with the Saints God's Own
[23:34] people consecrated and set apart for
[23:37] himself Hallelujah and you belong to
[23:39] God's Own
[23:41] household Hallelujah now this is very
[23:45] powerful and very
[23:47] important because Jesus
[23:50] said to
[23:53] Nicodemus except you be born again you
[23:56] can't enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[24:00] amen so Jesus was talking about
[24:03] something to get into am amen so I begin
[24:07] to realize that God's kingdom will have
[24:10] no illegal immigrants amen
[24:18] [Music]
[24:20] amen and to be a citiz you have to be
[24:25] born yes sir into the kingdom yes
[24:29] to get citizen
[24:31] rights on so I'm now beginning to see
[24:34] that once you are citizen you have
[24:37] rights if you are not a citizen you
[24:39] don't have the rights amen but once you
[24:42] a citizen you have a
[24:44] [Applause]
[24:46] right Hallelujah because you are citizen
[24:50] of that country oh could we give the
[24:53] Lord some Praises
[24:55] people Glory all the benefits in that
[24:58] country belongs to you if you call they
[25:01] have to answer if you protest they have
[25:03] to respond because you belong to that
[25:06] country nobody can boot you out kick you
[25:08] out cut you out because you belong there
[25:13] can somebody say Amen you have a right
[25:15] to Healing you have a right to
[25:17] breakthrough you have a right to Revival
[25:20] you have a right to overcoming because
[25:22] you are a citizen of that
[25:26] country Oh Glory
[25:29] Hallelujah glory to God
[25:31] Amen you believe that
[25:34] amen and Jesus said Matthew 18 verily I
[25:38] say unto you except you be converted and
[25:40] become as Little Children You shall not
[25:42] enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[25:43] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[25:46] as a little child the same is the
[25:49] greatest isn't that right Matthew 10 he
[25:51] said when Jesus saw it he was much
[25:53] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[25:55] little children to come unto me and
[25:56] forbid them not for such as the kingdom
[25:58] of God verily I say unto you whosoever
[26:00] will not receive the kingdom of God as a
[26:02] little child he shall not enter
[26:05] therein it's that
[26:07] simple there's a kingdom and we have to
[26:11] belong to it amen we have to become a
[26:14] citizen of it yes sir do you believe
[26:16] that oh glory to God and church
[26:18] membership conflicts with that
[26:20] citizenship yes Hallelujah so you could
[26:23] be a good church member and not a
[26:24] citizen
[26:26] amen because to a citizen you have to be
[26:29] born into it and then the rights belong
[26:32] to you when you walk you don't walk
[26:35] afraid you're not ducking the
[26:36] immigration you're not ducking the
[26:38] authorities you ducking anybody you
[26:42] belong you are no more stranger but you
[26:45] are
[26:46] citizen glory to God you belong to that
[26:51] country you belong to that Kingdom Oh
[26:54] Glory to God you can be pouring it but
[26:56] you still belong to that that Kingdom
[26:59] you can be struggling it but you belong
[27:01] to that Kingdom you're not a stranger
[27:04] you're not a foreigner you're not an
[27:05] alien you're not out of place to go to
[27:08] the father and ask for this and ask for
[27:11] that you're not out of place to tell the
[27:13] government we need to fix the roads
[27:16] you're not out of place to ask for
[27:18] electricity to ask for water you're not
[27:20] out of place because you have a kingdom
[27:23] Oh Glory to God and there's a king in
[27:25] that Kingdom and that domain is where he
[27:28] rules and Reigns it have a language it
[27:31] have a people it have a order it have
[27:34] rules it have laws oh that anything goes
[27:39] oh could be say Amen
[27:40] somebody
[27:42] Hallelujah so you to bring your own
[27:44] stuff in that Kingdom you have to
[27:46] conform to that Kingdom you have to find
[27:48] out what the king wants in that Kingdom
[27:50] you have to find out the order in that
[27:52] Kingdom you know there's strips in that
[27:54] Kingdom and say you are in the Kingdom

[40:16] from me if thou Willl take the left hand
[40:18] then I will go to the right or if thou
[40:21] depart to the right hand then I will go
[40:23] to the left and lot lifted up his eyes
[40:25] and behold all the plain of joy G that
[40:28] it uh was well watered everywhere before
[40:31] the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
[40:33] even as a garden of the Lord like the
[40:35] land of Egypt as thou comest into zor
[40:39] and then lot shows him all the plain of
[40:41] Jordan and lot uh journeyed East and
[40:46] they separated themselves then one from
[40:48] the other Abraham dwelt in the land of
[40:50] Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of
[40:53] the plain and pitched his tent towards
[40:58] Jordan uh Sodom sorry so what Sodom but

[44:31] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[44:33] the Lord hallu praise God hallelujah
[44:35] it's always a good thing to serve God
[44:38] it's a good thing to be able to come
[44:39] into his house and give him praise and
[44:42] worship not many people have this
[44:44] opportunity and yet there's only one
[44:46] life to live but God saw it fit to
[44:48] choose you and to love you and to bless
[44:51] you the way he has and he wants to bless
[44:53] you more this morning but there's
[44:55] something we've got to do there's
[44:56] something something we've got to fulfill
[44:58] and we want to get into that this
[44:59] morning is that right praise God so for
[45:01] a title I've chosen this morning a total
[45:05] separation for a total
[45:07] Deliverance amen amen do you love him
[45:10] this morning
[45:12] amen glory to
[45:16] God you know when a thief goes into a
[45:20] house he normally goes in and he has a
[45:24] little limited time to work with because
[45:27] the sun's coming up and he can't get
[45:29] caught so a thief goes into a house and
[45:31] he starts turning stuff up turning this
[45:34] over flipping this over ripping out
[45:36] everything upheaval destruction because
[45:39] he's looking for possessions he's
[45:40] looking for Treasures he's looking for
[45:42] things that he could sell he's looking
[45:44] for things that he could use for money
[45:46] isn't that right that's how a thief
[45:47] Works isn't that right and I can't help
[45:50] but sometimes we as preachers we come
[45:52] sometimes to turn some stuff up
[45:54] Hallelujah because we only have a short
[45:56] time to work with
[45:57] so we come to turn over some things this
[45:59] morning and to pull out a few things and
[46:01] to rip out a few things because we are
[46:03] looking for Treasures this morning we're
[46:05] looking for valuable things this morning
[46:07] we're looking for valuables this morning
[46:09] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[46:12] so we come to turn some stuff up this
[46:13] morning so I hope it's it's okay with
[46:15] you if we turn some stuff over this
[46:17] morning I hope it's okay if we open some
[46:19] doors this morning I hope it's okay if
[46:21] we invade the the space this morning but
[46:24] but sometimes we need a little Invasion
[46:25] this morning Hallelujah cuz we get too
[46:27] comfortable in our comfort zone things
[46:30] are all right and things are in a bed of
[46:32] ease but but God doesn't operate like
[46:34] that God doesn't have a plateau God
[46:37] doesn't just get to one settled place
[46:38] and he's all right with that no God
[46:40] always looking for Progress God always
[46:42] looking for what's the next thing what's
[46:44] the vision what's the purpose what are
[46:46] we trying to achieve amen isn't that
[46:49] right and once this vision is open to a
[46:51] man he gets into that Vision then
[46:53] there's nothing stopping him because God
[46:55] shares something with him God breaks
[46:57] open a seal to him and he's inspired he
[47:00] is enthused his whole mind is different
[47:03] his whole approach is different his
[47:05] whole way of doing things is different
[47:07] his whole anointing is different his
[47:09] whole approach is different so we want
[47:11] to change our approach this morning we
[47:14] want to change the way we approach this
[47:15] service this morning we want to change
[47:17] the way we praise we want to change the
[47:19] way we worship we want to change the way
[47:21] we do things because God is looking for
[47:24] results oh Hallelujah is that right
[47:27] God is not satisfied with you just
[47:29] coming to church and going back home
[47:32] you'll go to hell in that condition
[47:35] until you change something about your
[47:38] attitude this morning oh because with
[47:40] what you have you're not going to make
[47:42] it don't kid yourself this morning don't
[47:45] fool yourself this morning with what we
[47:47] have we are not going to make it it's
[47:50] going to take a power like we have never
[47:52] known before to take us up into glory
[47:55] and into the rapture
[47:56] [Music]
[47:58] oh is that
[47:59] right
[48:02] amen a total separation huj for total
[48:05] Deliverance am God's word always call
[48:09] for total separation isn't that right
[48:12] separate yourself the same thing brother
[48:14] over is talking about this morning you
[48:16] come out of one country you're a citizen
[48:18] of this country and they have their way
[48:20] of doing things and then when you
[48:22] migrate and go to another place there's
[48:24] a different place there's different
[48:25] houses there's different streets the
[48:28] people talk different they greet each
[48:29] other different they wear different
[48:31] clothes there's a different climate you
[48:33] can't wear the same clothes you was
[48:34] wearing in one country and wear it in
[48:36] another country where there's another
[48:38] atmosphere and another setting isn't
[48:40] that right you have to be outfitted for
[48:43] the battle you have to be prepared to go
[48:46] and meet what you're going to meet in
[48:47] there and if we go into another
[48:49] Ephesians you can't go in there in a
[48:51] vest and a short pants no put on the
[48:54] whole armor of God that you may be able
[48:56] to stand having done all to
[49:00] standall oh Hallelujah is that right
[49:03] it's a battle it's a Warfare It's one
[49:06] day up one day you're down but you've
[49:08] got to make it because God promised the
[49:11] land God give us the land and we not
[49:14] going to back down we've come too far to
[49:17] turn back now not when we on the
[49:19] threshold of the greatest anointing that

[50:14] stimulate you to motivate you to show
[50:17] you what you are to
[50:20] possess isn't that
[50:23] right glory to God wonderful wonderful
[50:26] cuz it was such groups that didn't
[50:27] possess the land that was they were
[50:28] supposed to possess isn't that right
[50:32] they contended oh hall for a little
[50:34] while but then they got slack concerning
[50:36] their promise they got lazy concerning
[50:38] what God had spoken to them and the
[50:41] amorites became a dwelling with them and
[50:44] different ones was dwelling with the
[50:45] jebusites was dwelling with this group
[50:47] and they were contented to sit around
[50:49] and lay around with demons and lay
[50:51] around with demons in their home and lay
[50:53] around with Supernatural forces and they
[50:56] were contended to to have Fellowship the

[52:11] God hallelujah you see the thing I
[52:13] realize is that oh praise God Malachi
[52:15] 4's message was
[52:18] designed
[52:20] specifically not for church members to
[52:25] survive there was actually actually it
[52:27] was actually tailored that
[52:29] way so the ones who trying to fight for
[52:32] church membership really don't have a
[52:35] clear understanding of what Malachi 4's
[52:38] message was to
[52:40] produce it was to produce another
[52:43] Ephesians it was supposed to produce a
[52:46] bride marching on to Perfection made up
[52:49] of
[52:50] individuals who have made up their mind
[52:53] to give up the world citizenship and to
[52:56] adopt Christ citizenship and to become
[52:59] citizens of his kingdom to renounce the
[53:03] world to separate themselves from all
[53:05] unbelief and to follow after God with
[53:09] all of their heart oh hallelujah
[53:13] hallelujah brother brandham said I
[53:15] didn't come to build no denomination he
[53:18] come to call Members into the bride he
[53:20] come to call us out of leosia for us to
[53:23] make up that Pride age that headstone
[53:26] age oh Hallelujah there's only
[53:28] perfection in
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:37] [Music]
[53:38] there amen amen isn't that right
[53:41] Hallelujah I think I'll just take my
[53:44] time it wasn't meant to encourage
[53:46] organization it wasn't meant to
[53:48] encourage denomination he blasted that
[53:51] right he was calling to the individuals
[53:53] it was five people in the service
[53:55] understood he was saying but the Brandon
[53:57] was preaching to those five people but
[53:59] he had a vision of a bride coming into
[54:02] view he had a vision of a bride Marching
[54:05] In Step marching in perfect order
[54:08] nothing out of kater nothing in chaos no
[54:12] no no no lights on this side Darkness on
[54:14] the other here's the church passing in
[54:17] all their mockery and in all their
[54:18] fleshling and in all their carnality but

[54:25] right oh she looked right oh she was
[54:28] beautiful to behold oh it was a bride of
[54:30] Jesus Christ Jesus been waiting a long
[54:33] time to get this bride and he's not
[54:36] going to settle for less he wants the
[54:38] same prde that he had down a Pentecost
[54:41] that same bride will emerge again out of
[54:44] the darkness a bride will come forth
[54:47] emerge praise God forg in the fire of
[54:50] God's
[54:52] love hallelujah hallelujah I counsel the
[54:55] by of me gold tried and fire oh
[54:58] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[55:01] amen gold what is that that's character
[55:05] and character is not a gift character is
[55:08] a victory you have to fight to get
[55:11] character you have to go through the
[55:13] fire to get character you have to go
[55:15] through something to get character you
[55:17] have to give up something to get
[55:19] character you have to get there
[55:21] Hallelujah into that place that God has
[55:24] called you to be at in order to get cold
[55:27] tried in the fire amen
[55:31] amen
[55:35] hallelujah they say that pure gold gold
[55:38] gold in its purest form Hallelujah isn't
[55:41] that yellowish thing that we we call
[55:43] Gold like you know to make rings it and
[55:45] so on gold in its purest form it's
[55:47] almost Crystal I think it's it's like a
[55:50] mirror you could look in it and see
[55:53] yourself that's gold in its purest form
[55:55] that's what they say
[55:58] and I believe that's what that's the
[55:59] kind of goal that God was talking about
[56:01] he must be able to see
[56:03] himself reflecting when he looks at you
[56:07] he must be able to see his character in
[56:10] your mirror of your life reflecting back
[56:12] Christ when people look at you they must
[56:15] look and see the reflection of Christ in
[56:17] the mirror of your life because your
[56:19] life is now a mirror the purest gold
[56:23] tried in the fires of God reflecting the
[56:26] life of God reflecting the virtues of
[56:29] God oh Hallelujah when that white light
[56:31] strikes that mirror out comes those
[56:33] rainbows flashing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 what is
[56:36] it the pure word of God being man
[56:40] manifested in your
[56:41] life is that what we're looking for this
[56:44] morning amen
[56:47] amen so God is a god of Holiness isn't
[56:50] that right God is a god of Purity God
[56:53] has his own character God has his own
[56:56] nature amen isn't that right isn't that
[56:59] right but over is likening it to the the
[57:02] a kingdom Hallelujah is that right and
[57:04] God has a kingdom set up in such a way
[57:07] and it it it it it has its own way of
[57:09] doing things it has its own modus of
[57:11] arandi you cannot move as normal in this
[57:14] Kingdom you cannot operate the way he
[57:16] was always operating no you have to
[57:18] change the way you've been looking
[57:20] change the way you've been doing things
[57:22] change your approach change your
[57:24] direction your motive your objective
[57:26] everything must line up with the word of
[57:29] God for the hour hallelujah hallelujah
[57:31] hallelujah and if it's not lining up
[57:33] then you need to find it you need to
[57:35] find out what God
[57:37] wants and go do it
[57:40] quickly isn't that
[57:44] right Glory I saw a quotation on
[57:48] Facebook it was kind of
[57:50] funny this uh Russian scientist I think
[57:54] was said that um he said they if there
[57:56] is a God then we should try to find him
[58:00] and find out what he wants for us he
[58:03] said but if there isn't a God he said
[58:05] and this Earth is spinning somewhere in
[58:07] the Galaxy at 100 something thousand mil
[58:10] hour and nobody is in control of
[58:14] it but if there is a go we should find
[58:17] him we should seek him out with all of
[58:20] our hearts and find out what he wants
[58:23] for our lives because there has to be
[58:25] some purpose
[58:27] there has to be some meaning for us to
[58:29] be here or we would not be here this
[58:32] morning isn't that right oh Hallelujah
[58:35] so many have gone into the ground and
[58:36] died but you are still here this morning
[58:39] their deaths their murders all around
[58:40] the country but how come you still alive
[58:43] there's got to be some purpose for your
[58:46] life there's got to be something that
[58:49] God hasn't store for you there's got to
[58:51] be
[58:53] something oh hallelujah hallelujah
[58:56] hallelujah hallelujah is life really
[58:58] meaningless as it seems is life really
[59:01] hum drum Jerry as it looks or is there
[59:03] some purpose for your life this morning
[59:05] or is there some meaning for your life
[59:07] this morning I don't even know what I'm
[59:09] saying anymore this morning but I feel
[59:11] God is in control and God is ministering
[59:13] to somebody this morning that needs to
[59:15] hear what is being said this morning
[59:17] there has to be a purpose there has to
[59:19] be some reason why you are sitting in
[59:22] this church this morning you didn't just
[59:24] come because you're feeling cish there
[59:26] has to be some reason there has to be
[59:28] some call in your heart that God is
[59:31] speaking to and something inside of you
[59:34] is responding to that
[59:38] call oh
[59:42] hallelujah
[59:44] [Applause]
[59:46] [Music]
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:49] hallelujah I don't know I was trying to
[59:51] explain Christianity to somebody they
[59:54] were saying Anthony what's Christianity
[59:55] like
[59:56] I said well I know the person like
[59:59] technology so I kind of reference it to
[1:00:01] that I said it's like you have a tablet
[1:00:04] or cell phone and you can get calls and
[1:00:07] texts that's fine anybody could use a
[1:00:09] cell phone that way that's a general
[1:00:11] purpose of a cell phone but when you
[1:00:13] turn on the Wi-Fi then that cell phone
[1:00:16] or that smartphone or whatever it
[1:00:18] becomes so much more there's a lot more
[1:00:20] that you can do with it it could become
[1:00:22] your personal planner it could become
[1:00:24] your calculator your programmer you can
[1:00:26] download an app for literally anything
[1:00:27] you want in the universe of apps there's
[1:00:30] over hundred thousand thousands and
[1:00:31] thousands of apps I don't know they've
[1:00:32] reached a million yet or I don't know
[1:00:34] but but but there's so much to access
[1:00:36] with that Wi-Fi but without the Wi-Fi
[1:00:39] you're limited to calls and texts it's
[1:00:42] about it that's about what any good cell
[1:00:45] phone provider could give you outside of
[1:00:47] Wi-Fi isn't that right and I said
[1:00:49] there's some people that have cell
[1:00:51] phones but they it's underutilized they
[1:00:54] never turn on the Wi-Fi as far as
[1:00:56] they're concerned they get calls and
[1:00:57] they get texts and they're happy with
[1:00:59] that but there are some people that just
[1:01:02] are burning with a desire to get this
[1:01:04] wi-fi because they know with that Wi-Fi
[1:01:06] they could get so much more with that
[1:01:08] Wi-Fi they could access so much more
[1:01:10] programs and they could get into that
[1:01:13] universe that is out there somewhere
[1:01:15] they can't touch it with their hands but
[1:01:17] they can interact with it through this
[1:01:19] smart phone or this smart device isn't
[1:01:21] that right isn't that right so so so
[1:01:24] when you are connected come on now to
[1:01:27] this Supernatural world that we're
[1:01:28] talking about when you are
[1:01:30] supernaturally connected to this Unseen
[1:01:33] World that we're talking about this this
[1:01:35] unseen reality it's like when you flip
[1:01:37] on your Wi-Fi all of a sudden God begins
[1:01:40] to start downloading downloading updates
[1:01:44] and your phone is pinging and something
[1:01:46] is happening and every day something is
[1:01:49] happening to you why because you are
[1:01:54] connected
[1:01:58] oh say Amen somebody that's why you must
[1:02:02] be born again you no longer become a
[1:02:04] creature of this time you become a
[1:02:06] creature of Eternity you belong to God
[1:02:10] and his kingdom oh Hallelujah and then
[1:02:13] through you you could heal the sick
[1:02:16] through you if there somebody has
[1:02:17] diabetes and they need a healing God
[1:02:20] could download something through your
[1:02:21] Wi-Fi and outcome healing to heal the
[1:02:24] sickness of whatever they have need of
[1:02:27] touch them by the
[1:02:28] infirmities oh you become all things to
[1:02:32] all men oh that by all means you might
[1:02:35] save
[1:02:38] some oh hallelujah
[1:02:42] hallelujah outside of that calls and
[1:02:47] texts it's up to
[1:02:50] you what kind of device you want to
[1:02:53] be amen but I want to be total used by
[1:02:56] God in whatever way he has for me to use
[1:02:59] me I'll be used that way but it'll be
[1:03:01] the grace of God to me amen how God has
[1:03:04] a gift for you he'll give it to you and
[1:03:06] you'll use it for the purpose and the
[1:03:07] furance of the Gospel but this gospel
[1:03:09] must be preached and then the end shall
[1:03:12] come don't look for signs don't look for
[1:03:14] distresses and uh Wars of Nations and
[1:03:17] that's supposed to happen Jesus talked
[1:03:19] about those things but he told the
[1:03:21] disciples don't look for that he said
[1:03:22] your sign is the gospel being preached
[1:03:25] into all the world
[1:03:26] and then the end shall come in other
[1:03:28] words while these things are happening
[1:03:30] God is seeing about his business God is
[1:03:33] seeing about his people I want his
[1:03:35] matter fix then end shall come oh
[1:03:39] hallelujah hallelujah say Amen

[1:03:50] good shepherd this morning he leaves a
[1:03:52] 99 and he goes after that one that one
[1:03:55] that's C in the thicket that one that's
[1:03:57] in the bush he'll go after them he hear
[1:04:00] them bleaching in the corner he knows
[1:04:02] where they are this morning he's got to
[1:04:04] find you he's got to get you you are the
[1:04:07] expression of his heart how can he
[1:04:09] forget you this morning he loves you
[1:04:13] 24/7 oh Hallelujah 365 days a year God
[1:04:17] loves
[1:04:19] you oh
[1:04:23] Hallelujah God is not feeling your love
[1:04:27] feel your love is is subjective
[1:04:31] to the other person loving you back
[1:04:34] isn't that right it has to be that kind
[1:04:36] of a way it's a human love but God's
[1:04:39] love is without condition he loves you
[1:04:43] regardless of what regardless of your
[1:04:46] condition you don't even have to love
[1:04:48] him back but he love you oh Hallelujah
[1:04:51] he died for you he died for the whole
[1:04:54] world oh Hal that right his blood covers
[1:04:57] the whole world going round and round
[1:04:59] like that and every sin is being bumped
[1:05:02] back off by that blood isn't that right
[1:05:05] that's what brother Bram saw in the
[1:05:06] vision he's about to condemn that lady
[1:05:09] in the bar God turned him around and
[1:05:11] showed him a different picture yeah see
[1:05:13] he was looking at the picture through
[1:05:16] his his lens through his glasses isn't
[1:05:18] that right God drop a blood lens in
[1:05:21] front of him and begin to see something
[1:05:23] different he begin to see a vision of
[1:05:26] what Calvary was and what it really
[1:05:29] means and what it was meant to show
[1:05:31] isn't that right then he turned around
[1:05:33] come back to the lady and begin to
[1:05:35] testify to her and tell her of what he
[1:05:38] was thinking and that testimony brought
[1:05:41] Deliverance to her because she was a
[1:05:44] Christian and something in her awakened
[1:05:46] she knew about the love of God but she'd
[1:05:48] got so far away from it that that maybe
[1:05:50] she felt that she couldn't go back but
[1:05:52] here was this Prophet telling her of an
[1:05:54] experience and all all of a sudden that
[1:05:56] call that was in our heart long time ago
[1:05:59] all of a sudden reemerged all of a
[1:06:01] sudden it came back all of a sudden it
[1:06:02] resurrected isn't that right and dark
[1:06:05] there in the B room he was able to save
[1:06:07] Souls by his testimony by his experience
[1:06:10] isn't that right of the power of the
[1:06:12] love of God oh Hal that's what the power
[1:06:14] of God's love does oh Hallelujah isn't
[1:06:17] that right is that love that's going to
[1:06:18] go out and it's going to call your
[1:06:20] families it's going to call your loved
[1:06:22] ones it's going to call your neighbors
[1:06:23] come come and rejoice with us we have
[1:06:26] found something it is the love of God it
[1:06:29] is forgiveness it is brotherly
[1:06:31] kindness oh
[1:06:33] Hallelujah that's what it is
[1:06:36] amen oh Hallelujah still in my intro so
[1:06:40] if we claim to be the children of God if
[1:06:43] we claim to be the children of the light
[1:06:45] then we have to stand for
[1:06:47] righteousness we have to stand for
[1:06:48] Holiness isn't that right amen if you
[1:06:51] claim to believe a certain thing then
[1:06:52] you have to stand for it otherwise what
[1:06:54] you're saying and what you're doing and
[1:06:55] become two different things you see and
[1:06:58] then it becomes do as I say and other as
[1:07:00] I do isn't that right but no that's not
[1:07:03] the way God operates isn't that right
[1:07:05] your actions have to line up with the
[1:07:07] word of God your thoughts speak louder
[1:07:09] in heaven than they do in words God is
[1:07:11] hearing what you are thinking oh
[1:07:13] Hallelujah H more than what you just
[1:07:15] shout in church or what you just tell a
[1:07:17] brother God bless you and you shake
[1:07:18] hands and so on that's fine that's
[1:07:20] wonderful but God is seeing deeper than
[1:07:22] that God is seeing the desires of your
[1:07:24] heart oh how he doesn't look on the out
[1:07:26] of the appearance that's why he could
[1:07:28] anoint David in the midst of his
[1:07:29] Brethren because he is not looking at
[1:07:31] who you are now he is looking at what
[1:07:33] you could become he is looking at the
[1:07:36] potentials that is laying inside of you
[1:07:38] that if you could just give a little
[1:07:40] then he could give of himself and the
[1:07:42] more you give out is the more he come in
[1:07:45] and the more you give out is the more he
[1:07:47] come
[1:07:48] in oh
[1:07:51] hallelujah amen for message called words
[1:07:53] called for total separation from
[1:07:55] unbelief
[1:07:56] amen and I have a a huge chunk of
[1:07:57] inspiration from here but I'll just read
[1:07:59] this here he said now now when he said
[1:08:01] that the Earth uh that God was going to
[1:08:04] use the Earth right he said and it was
[1:08:06] in total darkness is that right the
[1:08:09] spirit of God spoke out and he said let
[1:08:12] there be light and he separated the
[1:08:15] light from the darkness he said and it's
[1:08:17] been doing that ever since separating
[1:08:21] light from Darkness isn't that right
[1:08:24] there was the earth laying in chaos us
[1:08:26] up was down down was up you couldn't
[1:08:27] tell left from right here from there and
[1:08:30] all of a sudden God begin to bring order
[1:08:32] to the picture amen because that's what
[1:08:34] God is God is a god of order he's a god
[1:08:36] of planning and he's a god of
[1:08:38] organization he he likes to put things
[1:08:40] in a certain perspective according to
[1:08:42] the way he see it fit not man's
[1:08:44] organization now God's organization
[1:08:46] that's different amen amen hallelujah
[1:08:49] hallelujah so when he come he give it to
[1:08:50] speak let there be light then he
[1:08:52] separated the light from the darkness
[1:08:54] and he called a light day that he called
[1:08:56] The Darkness night and that was the
[1:08:58] first day isn't that right in the Bible
[1:09:00] praise God hallelujah and he's been
[1:09:02] doing that ever since Hallelujah
[1:09:06] separating light from Darkness because
[1:09:08] they can have no communion they could
[1:09:10] really have no Fellowship light is light
[1:09:13] and darkness is Darkness oh hallelujah
[1:09:15] hallelujah isn't that
[1:09:17] right said God's word also separated the
[1:09:20] water from the land in the beginning
[1:09:22] isn't that right so it was a constant
[1:09:24] separation going on he separated the
[1:09:26] fillment of the Heaven from the fillment
[1:09:28] of the earth and so on isn't that
[1:09:31] right God spoke and the water was
[1:09:34] separated from the land and he had a
[1:09:36] reason for that isn't that right the
[1:09:38] prophet says God never speaks a word
[1:09:41] unless he's got a reason for speaking
[1:09:44] that word right he said he's not like
[1:09:46] you and I that that we just especially
[1:09:49] myself he says that speak so many
[1:09:50] foolish things he said God speaks every
[1:09:53] word with a meaning and something that
[1:09:56] he's trying to achieve and will achieve
[1:09:59] it by his word and it will perform
[1:10:01] exactly what he said it will do he said
[1:10:05] and now if God said let there be light
[1:10:07] and there was no light then then it
[1:10:08] wasn't God that said that see but when
[1:10:11] God says anything he must back up what
[1:10:15] he says and when the word of God has
[1:10:17] been Vindicated the word has been
[1:10:19] Vindicated he said that is light and God
[1:10:22] backs up what he says so if if he says
[1:10:25] you are going to be delivered God backs
[1:10:28] up what he says if he says he's going to
[1:10:31] fill you with the Holy Ghost God backs
[1:10:33] up what he says if he said healing is a
[1:10:36] children's bread then God backs up what
[1:10:39] he
[1:10:40] says oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:48] hallelujah amen amen God anything he
[1:10:51] must back it up isn't that
[1:10:53] right Hallelujah he said now the word
[1:10:55] itself isn't light until it's a
[1:10:58] Vindicated light see so it was spoken
[1:11:01] but it wasn't Vindicated yet the light
[1:11:03] had not yet come the manifestation that
[1:11:06] Vindication is what makes that word real
[1:11:08] living and present tense that's what
[1:11:10] manifest it as light that's right isn't
[1:11:13] that right so it's a word until it come
[1:11:16] to a manifestation so you can't just be
[1:11:18] happy with word you got to want a
[1:11:23] manifestation oh come on now God said I
[1:11:26] give you the land but you've got to want
[1:11:28] to take it oh we're pressing into
[1:11:31] something now I feel something dropping
[1:11:33] down God told Joshua this border and
[1:11:35] that border and this border and that
[1:11:37] border and it's okay I'm sure you could
[1:11:40] put that up on Facebook and say God told
[1:11:42] me that this is my land you could
[1:11:44] broadcast it to the media and tell
[1:11:46] everybody that this is my land but
[1:11:49] unless you go and take it for yourself
[1:11:51] you have nothing to get because that's
[1:11:53] still a word until become manifested and
[1:11:57] God is not satisfied with just a word
[1:12:00] but he wants to see a manifestation of
[1:12:04] that word in your
[1:12:07] life oh Hal isn't that right or else it
[1:12:11] just remains a
[1:12:13] word calls and
[1:12:17] texts is that
[1:12:19] right oh
[1:12:21] my see okay where was I he must back at
[1:12:25] what he says right okay um so if God
[1:12:28] said let there be light and there was no
[1:12:29] light then it wasn't the word of God
[1:12:31] this it wasn't the word of God but when
[1:12:33] light sprung up upon sprung upon the
[1:12:35] Earth that showed the word was
[1:12:38] Vindicated and it was light he said and
[1:12:41] now today if God's made a promise and
[1:12:44] when that promise is Vindicated then
[1:12:46] that is light that is the light of the
[1:12:49] day when the word is Vindicated the word
[1:12:52] for the hour is a Vindicated oh so when
[1:12:56] the word of the hour is Vindicated in us
[1:12:58] when this seven tunder manifestation
[1:13:00] come upon the bride then we will become
[1:13:03] the light of the world to this
[1:13:05] generation then we will be the light for
[1:13:07] the hour then there shall be light in
[1:13:10] the evening time when cross Darkness
[1:13:12] cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the
[1:13:14] people but there's promised to be a
[1:13:16] glorious bride without spots without
[1:13:19] wrinkle washing the blood of the Lamb
[1:13:21] portraying the light to the world Amen
[1:13:25] oh amen isn't that right amen
[1:13:29] hallelujah amen okay I'll read it
[1:13:31] quickly from his INF feeling words a
[1:13:33] promise amen but the B says faith is by
[1:13:36] hearing the word of God the Word of
[1:13:38] Promise isn't that right he said if you
[1:13:40] don't have a promise he said then you
[1:13:42] venture out upon your own fate but if
[1:13:46] you take a promise of God that's God's
[1:13:50] promise to you he said the woman that
[1:13:53] touched His Garment she had no promise
[1:13:55] of that isn't that right he said but her
[1:13:58] fith without a promise got her healing
[1:14:03] isn't that right the Bible says she told
[1:14:05] herself if I could just touch she
[1:14:08] ventured out upon her own fate she
[1:14:11] didn't have a scripture to show what she
[1:14:13] was doing but she just had a desire and
[1:14:16] that little fate like a mustard seed did
[1:14:19] so much that she pressed her away she
[1:14:22] pressed past this one she pressed past
[1:14:24] that one and she got her blessing isn't
[1:14:26] that right without a
[1:14:29] promise isn't that right Joshua didn't
[1:14:34] have a scripture didn't have a Bible he
[1:14:36] could open to say son stand still he
[1:14:39] didn't have a promise for that but he
[1:14:41] spoke to the son because he had a need
[1:14:44] he spoke to the Moon he said Moon hang
[1:14:47] over the aelon valley I've got to finish
[1:14:50] this I can't let the enemy get the one
[1:14:52] upon on me I've got to get the one upon
[1:14:55] them and if God be with me then I shall

[1:15:03] and slicing and guess what the sun Stood
[1:15:07] Still without a promise oh this morning

[1:28:17] morning oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:28:20] right Hallelujah isn't that right it's
[1:28:23] like that Rich Young Ruler
[1:28:24] come towards Jesus said Rabbi Rabbi what
[1:28:27] shall I do Great Master what shall I do
[1:28:30] to be inherit in life and so on Jesus
[1:28:34] said call me good
[1:28:36] master I'm not that but but you know you
[1:28:39] could obey the Commandments do the right
[1:28:42] thing pay your tithes come to church
[1:28:44] early you know do all the nice things
[1:28:47] say Amen say hallelujah shake hands in
[1:28:49] the church and you'll be fine young man
[1:28:53] said I've been doing all that since my
[1:28:54] youth what am I lacking and you see that
[1:28:58] question that question is what turned
[1:29:01] the key for Jesus because he was along
[1:29:04] down the the the normal theological path
[1:29:07] amen of of what a preacher would tell
[1:29:09] somebody else and I'm sure that young
[1:29:11] man went to other people and asked them
[1:29:13] the same thing isn't that right I'm sure
[1:29:15] he went to Pharisees there were
[1:29:16] Sadducees in those times there were the
[1:29:17] sex of the scribes they knew the
[1:29:19] scripture inside out he could probably
[1:29:20] ask them what what shall I do to inherit
[1:29:22] eternal life and maybe they W able to WR
[1:29:24] the same thing so he wasn't satisfied
[1:29:26] with that answer because they were all
[1:29:28] telling him the same thing and here was
[1:29:30] Jesus saying the same thing but but he
[1:29:32] knew there was something special about
[1:29:33] this man he knew there was something
[1:29:35] special about this this Jesus of
[1:29:37] Nazareth so so he he prodded a little
[1:29:40] further he said I do all these things
[1:29:42] already but but what am I lacking and
[1:29:45] the Bible said when he said
[1:29:47] that he said right there at that moment
[1:29:50] Jesus loved him and down come the love
[1:29:53] of God and saw what was in his heart and
[1:29:56] saw what he needed to give up and saw
[1:29:58] what he needed to separate himself from
[1:30:01] come on now and he said listen listen
[1:30:02] you have a spirit upon you you're doing
[1:30:05] all the right things but there's one
[1:30:07] thing that you're lacking he said you

[1:33:02] follow after this man who had an
[1:33:04] anointing he liked that anointing he

[1:35:41] man God man broke God's word in the
[1:35:44] Garden of Eden isn't that right from
[1:35:46] since that time death hangs over every
[1:35:48] man's life and every life is required
[1:35:51] before God you have to give an account
[1:35:53] for what you do in this body that's
[1:35:55] right for the Deeds that you do in this
[1:35:58] body you have to give an account the
[1:36:00] Bible says I saw the the sea give up the
[1:36:04] dead but great and small all the books
[1:36:07] were open and every man from Adam go all

[1:36:44] good report I want to say I've done run
[1:36:46] the race I finished my course I want to
[1:36:49] say there's a treasure laid up for me
[1:36:51] somewhere out y
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:37:00] hallelujah it's not easy
[1:37:02] friends you're called out and you have
[1:37:05] to leave what you're accustomed to to go
[1:37:07] into a place you don't know this was
[1:37:09] Abraham's story but the part I love
[1:37:12] about this was that Abraham was a father
[1:37:14] of Nations isn't that right he
[1:37:17] represented everything that God was
[1:37:19] about to do down Through the Ages isn't
[1:37:22] that right he represent the the the the
[1:37:24] seed of that the the the the the first
[1:37:26] fruit of that he represented the first
[1:37:29] one that was to step out and and and the
[1:37:31] father of Faith isn't that right this
[1:37:33] first great patriarch he represented
[1:37:36] prophets that were to come he
[1:37:38] represented kings that were to be raised
[1:37:40] up he represented Nations that were to
[1:37:42] be brought out by the hand of God he
[1:37:45] represented prophets and holy men he
[1:37:47] represented priests he represented David
[1:37:50] he represented Moses he represented all
[1:37:53] these prophets of old in him was Samuel
[1:37:56] in him was all these great prophets out
[1:37:59] of his loins were to come for these
[1:38:01] Great Men of
[1:38:03] God come on now Hallelujah and if he
[1:38:07] hadn't steep out and done what God told
[1:38:10] him to do it'll be a different Bible
[1:38:13] that's right isn't that right because
[1:38:15] this is the Book of Genesis what would
[1:38:18] Exodus be what would judge judges be
[1:38:21] it'd be a mess but he stepped out anyway
[1:38:24] because in him represented all those
[1:38:26] Souls that would have come forth and
[1:38:28] this morning you might think much of
[1:38:30] yourself but you sitting here in these
[1:38:32] pews represent people that are yet to
[1:38:35] hear this gospel you represent people
[1:38:39] that are yet to come into this church
[1:38:41] you represent people that before the
[1:38:43] darkness spreads they are going to come
[1:38:45] to the gospel by your life by your signs
[1:38:49] and wonders by your manifestation of
[1:38:52] Jesus Christ life they're going to
[1:38:54] come oh
[1:39:01] Hallelujah Hall that changes the picture
[1:39:05] huh changes how you see church now
[1:39:08] you're not coming because well I'm tired
[1:39:10] but I got to make it you know got to pay
[1:39:12] my ties today so I
[1:39:15] came changes the picture now now now now
[1:39:17] we begin to realize that that there's
[1:39:19] more to you there's more to your life
[1:39:21] there's more there's more that what God
[1:39:23] want to fulfill that you are
[1:39:24] representing a great move of God because
[1:39:27] it took 120 to bring 3,000 and those
[1:39:30] 3,000 brought more and brought more why
[1:39:32] why the gospel begin to spread because
[1:39:34] God had a nucleus that he could work
[1:39:36] with God had a group that he could use
[1:39:38] God had a group that he could move with
[1:39:40] oh hallelujah hallelujah to spread the
[1:39:42] gospel the good news
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:50] amen isn't that
[1:39:52] right this ought to separate you from
[1:39:54] all the material things because that
[1:39:56] means nothing what about the souls of
[1:39:58] your children what about the souls of
[1:40:00] your family what about the souls of
[1:40:02] people who are yet to understand the
[1:40:04] love of God they might be able to read a
[1:40:07] tract or a Bible or a spoken word book
[1:40:09] but your life is going to bring them in
[1:40:11] your life have to become so salty your
[1:40:14] life have to become so full of God's
[1:40:16] love and mercy that they want to come
[1:40:19] that they feel the need to ask you
[1:40:21] something about Jesus because they
[1:40:23] seeing it they're seeing it you're
[1:40:25] Hallelujah gold tried and fire standing
[1:40:28] before them as a witness to this Dying
[1:40:30] World that there is a Jesus out there
[1:40:33] somewhere and he's standing on two feet
[1:40:35] he's Healing The Sick raising the
[1:40:39] dead
[1:40:42] Hallelujah that's the Jesus I want to
[1:40:45] see one that walked in Galilee the one
[1:40:47] that healed the leper the one that spoke
[1:40:50] amen hallelujah and there it was that's
[1:40:52] the Jesus I want to see this hour that's
[1:40:54] a Jesus we need in this hour the
[1:40:56] darkness is coming and end the end is
[1:40:58] coming but God promised oh Hall that
[1:41:01] group that their hearts would turn back
[1:41:03] to the original fate and we are that
[1:41:06] group this morning because we heard the
[1:41:08] call of this Malachi four Prophet that
[1:41:11] was sent to turn our hearts back to the
[1:41:13] faith of the fathers oh Hallelujah to go
[1:41:15] back to the faith that Paul preached to
[1:41:17] go back to the fate of that Ephesians
[1:41:19] church we have to go back there to pick
[1:41:22] up what they had and reproduce Christ
[1:41:24] again in the natural praise
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:33] God
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:37] hallelujah my God that's the call of a
[1:41:40] Christian Life come out into a land that
[1:41:42] I will show you Abraham never been there
[1:41:44] before Abraham never seen it before
[1:41:46] you're 75 years old I think when he left
[1:41:48] home decided to go out and follow the
[1:41:50] word of the Lord yes he didn't have a
[1:41:52] map
[1:41:54] he didn't have a guy he didn't have a
[1:41:57] guy dog he didn't have anything he went
[1:41:59] out and he followed the word of the Lord
[1:42:02] and that's what we're asked to do as
[1:42:03] Christians we are here to follow the
[1:42:05] word of the Lord we're not here to
[1:42:07] follow a man we are here to follow the
[1:42:09] pillar of fire wherever he leads we
[1:42:12] follow we here to follow his word his
[1:42:14] word only isn't that right when that
[1:42:17] pillar fire dropped down and they were
[1:42:18] leading the children of Israel out of
[1:42:20] Egypt down to Moses had to subject
[1:42:23] himself to the leading of the pillar of
[1:42:25] fire Moses himself couldn't say well I
[1:42:28] feel to go this way no it wasn't up to
[1:42:31] Moses it was up to the fire it was a
[1:42:33] fire that led them down to the Sea the
[1:42:36] Red Sea because he wanted to prove
[1:42:38] himself before
[1:42:40] Moses and for all the people and before
[1:42:43] Pharaoh that God was the god of
[1:42:46] Israel H to show how Mighty he was to
[1:42:49] show how powerful he was he led them
[1:42:51] down to a situation where they seem that
[1:42:54] they can't make it where they seem that
[1:42:55] there was nothing else where there was
[1:42:57] no more answer but the eyes of the Lord
[1:43:00] look through the pillar of fire and was
[1:43:02] angry at the Red
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:10] Sea Hallelujah so that's what we're
[1:43:13] following this morning the spirit of God
[1:43:15] the supernatural not the natural flesh
[1:43:18] is flesh but spirit is Spirit that's
[1:43:21] what God told Nicodemus isn't uh Jesus
[1:43:22] told Nicodemus isn't that right said you
[1:43:24] must be born again amen or else you
[1:43:28] cannot even see the kingdom of God that
[1:43:31] which is of the flesh is of the flesh
[1:43:33] but that which is of the spirit is of
[1:43:35] the Spirit light is light and darkness
[1:43:37] is Darkness it's two different things
[1:43:40] it's two different worlds we are leaving
[1:43:43] this world to go into another one you
[1:43:46] cannot go into that other world in an
[1:43:48] imperfect State you've got to come to
[1:43:51] Perfection to get to that world of
[1:43:53] perfection because in that world is
[1:43:55] perfection you can't go into a perfect
[1:43:58] world with an imperfect State you have
[1:44:00] to become
[1:44:03] perfect that's what the Rapture is for
[1:44:06] to changes Mortals into immortality to
[1:44:09] change this corruptible into
[1:44:11] incorruption that we can be changing the
[1:44:14] body in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:44:16] an eye and go up to meet our
[1:44:20] savior isn't that right was a god of
[1:44:23] perfection then he became imperfection
[1:44:26] to die for our sins isn't that right
[1:44:29] Hallelujah that we could become
[1:44:30] Perfection the god of perfection died
[1:44:33] isn't that right uh on the cross isn't
[1:44:35] that right and took all sins the sinless
[1:44:38] one became sin took on our sins bore our
[1:44:41] faults bore our failures bore our
[1:44:43] mistakes bore our situations isn't that
[1:44:46] right bore everything praise God
[1:44:48] hallelujah you was to be on that cross
[1:44:50] but he died for you he paid the price
[1:44:52] for you you he took on your sin oh
[1:44:55] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:59] hallelujah he paid the price so that you
[1:45:02] could become like he was sinless holy
[1:45:07] righteous without blemish wash white as
[1:45:10] snow that's the purpose of the Gospel
[1:45:13] that's the purpose that he died for oh
[1:45:16] Hallelujah hallelu no wonderers Prophet
[1:45:18] cried out he said Lord let these things
[1:45:20] live in me let these seven Thunders live
[1:45:22] in me oh lord is my prayer because
[1:45:24] that's the purpose he died for he said
[1:45:26] let Faith live in me let virtue live in
[1:45:28] me let knowledge live in me oh
[1:45:30] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[1:45:33] God wants you to live for him he died
[1:45:36] for you so that you could live for him
[1:45:39] oh isn't that right my God let me get
[1:45:42] on Amen trying to keep this in the time
[1:45:45] here but
[1:45:47] uh even though Abraham came out of his
[1:45:51] household and so on and began walking he
[1:45:54] still had lot with him isn't that right
[1:45:58] he still had lot tagging along now lot
[1:46:02] could have chose his own Road a long
[1:46:04] time ago because he had his own
[1:46:05] household he had his own thing was going
[1:46:07] on he had his own Hersman his own
[1:46:10] cattle and even though we come out even
[1:46:13] though we come out to follow Jesus
[1:46:15] sometimes there are some things that
[1:46:16] still hanging on to us there's some
[1:46:18] things that still they were not yet
[1:46:20] willing to let go of yet just yet
[1:46:24] because just in case this Christianity
[1:46:26] thing don't work out I got something I
[1:46:29] could fall back
[1:46:30] on isn't that right sometimes that's the
[1:46:34] way we do because we not fully yet to
[1:46:37] trust him in all things we're not ready
[1:46:40] yet to put everything in his hand and
[1:46:42] say Lord you take it and not take it
[1:46:45] back say Lord I know
[1:46:47] I I know I know I give you the finances
[1:46:49] there but I just need just need a little
[1:46:51] bit from it no no give it all to God
[1:46:55] give it all to him and see what he does
[1:46:56] with it Hallelujah see how he could take
[1:46:58] it and use it see how he could provide
[1:47:01] for you Jesus said consider the birds
[1:47:04] consider the bees they don't they don't
[1:47:05] worry about what's going to happen
[1:47:06] tomorrow they trust in the Lord they
[1:47:09] they everything is there for them God
[1:47:11] provides for them Jesus said seek ye
[1:47:13] first the kingdom of God and all other
[1:47:17] things shall be added unto you don't
[1:47:19] worry about tomorrow don't worry about
[1:47:22] what this going to happen or if that's
[1:47:23] going to happen don't worry about the
[1:47:25] floods David said if 10,000 fall on my
[1:47:27] right side and a thousand on my left I
[1:47:30] shall not be moved because the Lord is
[1:47:32] my keeper the Lord is my shade upon my
[1:47:36] right hand and the sun shall not Smite
[1:47:38] be thy day the moon shall not smite me
[1:47:40] by night but he shall preserve my
[1:47:44] soul he shall preserve me from all
[1:47:49] evil that's the God we serve the god is
[1:47:53] able to preserve you to
[1:47:56] preserve the children of Israel were
[1:47:58] walking out in the wilderness and their
[1:47:59] shoes never wore down their clothes
[1:48:02] never wore down that's crazy they were
[1:48:04] 40 years in the wilderness but God was
[1:48:06] keeping the very clothes on their back
[1:48:08] and the Very shoes on their feet and and
[1:48:11] if God can keep shoes if God can keep
[1:48:14] clothes then what about you this morning
[1:48:16] God is able to keep you I I say he is
[1:48:19] more than able to keep you this
[1:48:21] morning to teach your fingers to fight
[1:48:24] and to keep your feet from falling
[1:48:28] hallelujah oh
[1:48:32] my lot was hanging around I think it was
[1:48:35] his nephew was his brother's son they
[1:48:39] were good I guess they had a nice
[1:48:41] relationship all that started to get
[1:48:43] messed up when the blessings start to
[1:48:46] fall blessings is do some strange things
[1:48:48] to human beings true you see it all
[1:48:51] through the years
[1:48:53] soon as God bless a man get all puffed
[1:48:56] up feel like he's got it all he could
[1:48:58] move he could do what he want say what
[1:49:00] he want you don't need God no more you
[1:49:03] got
[1:49:06] blessings you know I guess that was
[1:49:09] lot's state after a while because he
[1:49:11] didn't understand where these blessings
[1:49:12] were coming from cuz he God wasn't
[1:49:14] speaking to lot he talking to Abraham he
[1:49:17] said Abraham come out I bless thee I'll
[1:49:19] multiply thee as a sign of the seashore
[1:49:21] isn't that right it was God speaking to
[1:49:23] Abraham but those blessings were falling
[1:49:25] upon lot and upon the herdsmen and he
[1:49:28] was in the right place at the right time
[1:49:30] I
[1:49:31] guess isn't that right they had water
[1:49:34] when they needed they had food when they
[1:49:36] needed they had gold they had silver
[1:49:38] they had flux everything was going fine
[1:49:40] but but there was Strife between them
[1:49:43] there was war between them there was
[1:49:45] enity between them there was there was
[1:49:46] all kinds of situations come up fighting
[1:49:49] for little foolishness all of a sudden a
[1:49:51] fight Breakout Abraham and lot of go
[1:49:53] there and separate them say no no wait
[1:49:55] wait Abraham said listen this cannot
[1:49:58] continue that's right it can amen I
[1:50:01] prefer you go anywhere you want to go
[1:50:04] and I will go anywhere I want to go but
[1:50:06] please in the name of Peace don't let us
[1:50:08] fight that was Abraham's plead with lot
[1:50:11] isn't that right and his herds men so it
[1:50:14] come down to a time where all these
[1:50:17] natural attachments all these natural
[1:50:19] things that Abraham was connected to
[1:50:21] after a while he had to give it all up
[1:50:23] that's right God began to bring
[1:50:24] situations to show Abraham that God was
[1:50:28] getting ready to bless him but there was
[1:50:30] something he had to do first before he
[1:50:32] could F fully be blessed and this
[1:50:35] morning I can't help but feel that
[1:50:36] there's some things that you've got to
[1:50:38] do before you could really get the
[1:50:40] blessing that you're looking for you see
[1:50:43] Abraham was walking in God's permissive
[1:50:46] will and allowing him to be blessed and
[1:50:48] to have cattle and to so on but that
[1:50:50] wasn't the purpose that God brought him
[1:50:52] out of his father's house for God
[1:50:55] brought him out of his father's house to
[1:50:56] bring him into a land where he will show
[1:50:59] him where he was to multiply and
[1:51:01] replenish like Abraham was to do in uh
[1:51:03] like Adam was to do in the beginning
[1:51:04] when the fall of Eden took place isn't
[1:51:06] that right here was God now trying to
[1:51:09] reestablish his kingdom on the earth
[1:51:11] through men and through the Mortal Seed
[1:51:13] of Abraham isn't that right called him
[1:51:15] out separated him from his father and
[1:51:17] mother and so forth Hallelujah it was
[1:51:19] God trying to reestablish his kingdom on
[1:51:21] the earth among a people on the earth a
[1:51:23] separated people he was trying to
[1:51:24] establish a royal priesthood a holy
[1:51:26] nation A peculiar people A peculiar
[1:51:29] treasure he wanted something that was
[1:51:31] different from what was out there God
[1:51:34] knew all the kings of the earth God knew
[1:51:36] Sodom God knew gomorra and their
[1:51:37] wickedness and their foolishness but God
[1:51:39] is getting ready in the middle of their
[1:51:41] foolishness in the middle of their evil
[1:51:44] isn't that right God was establishing a
[1:51:46] new kingdom God is establishing a new
[1:51:48] people and I can't help but feel that
[1:51:50] that's what God is doing in this hour in
[1:51:52] the middle of Sodom in the middle of
[1:51:54] gomorra while all the evil is taking
[1:51:57] place and while all the kings of the
[1:51:58] Earth are enjoying their riches and
[1:52:00] enjoying their wisdom God is getting
[1:52:02] ready to establish his people on the
[1:52:05] Earth a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:52:09] peculiar people a called out people a
[1:52:12] separated
[1:52:14] people
[1:52:20] hallelujah so you can't really serve god
[1:52:22] with your whole
[1:52:24] heart because if cuz you still have some
[1:52:27] Desires in there you're not yet really
[1:52:30] to give
[1:52:31] up there's still some secret
[1:52:35] stuff that you're
[1:52:38] hiding like a backup plan you know just
[1:52:42] go back to this if this doesn't work
[1:52:45] out you know I'll just serve God at
[1:52:49] 99% see that's the way some people think
[1:52:52] but but God wants your whole
[1:52:54] heart see if if you've got a vessel and
[1:52:57] there's stuff in it God really can't
[1:52:58] fill the vessel until you empty it out
[1:53:02] get all that stuff out of there and then
[1:53:05] God could fill it with all of himself
[1:53:08] then God could put all of himself into
[1:53:10] it isn't that right God wants to bless
[1:53:14] you more than you are willing to be
[1:53:15] blessed more than you could understand
[1:53:17] it isn't that right there was once a
[1:53:20] woman in the Bible when Elisha had
[1:53:23] crossed Jordan and the the power of God
[1:53:26] was visible in his ministry one of the
[1:53:29] early records of what he began to do in
[1:53:31] the Bible there was this woman who had a
[1:53:34] pot of
[1:53:35] oil and she had some Sons there and she
[1:53:38] was in debt she was in need she owed
[1:53:41] some money or something like that I
[1:53:43] don't know but she was running out of
[1:53:44] money and all she had was a pot of oil
[1:53:47] and she came before Elisha and she said
[1:53:50] Elisha your servant you know your
[1:53:52] servant
[1:53:53] Hallelujah is gone I think one of her
[1:53:55] husband was a prophet or something like
[1:53:56] that and she was in a condition she had
[1:53:58] a need and she said Lord what shall I do
[1:54:03] and and and and Elisha looked at her and
[1:54:05] here come the Z and drop down and Elisha
[1:54:07] begin to minister to her and tell her
[1:54:09] listen listen take that pot of oil what
[1:54:11] do you have in the house what do you
[1:54:12] have that you could give she said all I
[1:54:14] have is a is a pot of oil all I have in
[1:54:17] my whole household left she said I've
[1:54:19] sold everything but all I've got left is
[1:54:21] a pot of oil he said bring that pot of
[1:54:23] oil what do you have this morning is it
[1:54:26] a pot of oil you could bring it before
[1:54:28] the Lord this morning it might be
[1:54:30] something small but but he could use it
[1:54:32] this morning he could transform it this
[1:54:34] morning he could multiply it this
[1:54:35] morning he could do anything this
[1:54:37] morning he's a god that is able to
[1:54:39] provide every need
[1:54:43] amen he said bring it bring it bring the
[1:54:45] pot of oil and she brought it before him
[1:54:48] waiting for hear what he would say he
[1:54:49] said listen go out into the streets
[1:54:52] he said go out into the neighborhood he
[1:54:55] said and ask of them for some vessels to
[1:54:58] borrow he said but listen this was a
[1:55:01] most this is a key part of it borrow not
[1:55:05] a few in other words don't limit your
[1:55:09] blessing get anything that you could get
[1:55:14] go get it go find it oh hallelujah

[1:55:26] had to knock on some doors that morning
[1:55:28] I sure there were some people she wasn't
[1:55:29] accustomed saying hello to but she had
[1:55:31] to Humble herself a little bit cuz she
[1:55:34] was in a situation and she needed a

[1:58:13] the token it'll be
[1:58:18] individuals
[1:58:20] Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:25] Hallelujah God's word always calls for
[1:58:27] total separation from
[1:58:29] unbelief um I'll read from here he says
[1:58:31] Jesus had has constantly told us that
[1:58:34] there is a separation and we find that
[1:58:37] the last thing that's predicted okay to
[1:58:39] to the human race before uh the great
[1:58:42] final
[1:58:44] day uh when we Ascend into the presence
[1:58:46] of God there will be a final separation
[1:58:48] he will separate the sheep from the
[1:58:49] goats God will continue
[1:58:52] has been separating separating and
[1:58:55] that's what he's doing tonight that's
[1:58:57] what he always does he can you can see
[1:59:00] it in every meeting he separates Faith
[1:59:02] from unbelief he speaks out he declares
[1:59:05] himself to those who will believe him
[1:59:07] and have faith in him he said and I
[1:59:10] believe tonight that every man and woman
[1:59:12] every boy and girl that's born of the
[1:59:13] spirit of God is a Nazarite unto the
[1:59:15] Lord because they have separated them
[1:59:18] things themselves from the cares of the
[1:59:20] world and whatever the world has got to
[1:59:22] say amen amen amen amen isn't that
[1:59:26] right Hallelujah he said you live in a
[1:59:28] city here okay where there's great
[1:59:30] schools and so forth he said and we see
[1:59:32] our nation calling for higher standard
[1:59:34] of Education which is all right he said
[1:59:36] nothing to say about that but that
[1:59:37] education cannot give you
[1:59:40] salvation he said a scientist can split
[1:59:42] a grain of wheat and tell you how many
[1:59:44] different chemicals is in it but it
[1:59:46] can't find the life that's in there and
[1:59:49] education can learn you or teach you
[1:59:51] mathematics and they can teach you
[1:59:53] history and whatever more but they
[1:59:54] cannot bring light to you your education
[1:59:57] will not do
[2:00:00] that amen Co give me a bit of trouble
[2:00:03] here
[2:00:06] amen amen says God has one way of
[2:00:09] bringing light to you that's when you're
[2:00:11] ready to separate yourself from all of
[2:00:14] the things of the world and all of the
[2:00:16] cares of the world and cling only to
[2:00:18] God's promised word isn't that right he
[2:00:22] said Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord
[2:00:24] he was separated from his Orthodox
[2:00:26] Church to the word of the Living God oh
[2:00:29] that's the reason he could be so sold
[2:00:31] out that's the reason he could preach
[2:00:33] the way he preached why because Paul was
[2:00:34] separated unto God isn't that right he
[2:00:37] said Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord
[2:00:39] he was separated from among the Brethren
[2:00:42] to Bear the birth stones and to be the
[2:00:44] high priest oh Hallelujah so he couldn't
[2:00:46] hang around and mingle with people like
[2:00:48] he wanted to because he was set apart
[2:00:50] from the rest of them he was Paul to be
[2:00:52] a holy man to go into the holies of
[2:00:54] holies he had a special role to
[2:00:57] play isn't that right said it was a
[2:01:00] total separation we not to go back to
[2:01:02] the world no more or have anything to do
[2:01:04] with the world but cleave un only unto
[2:01:07] God Jesus is coming after a bride a
[2:01:10] woman a church that's separated from the
[2:01:13] things of the world or the cares of the
[2:01:15] world she is separated from the Fashions
[2:01:17] of this Modern Age that we live in she's
[2:01:20] separated from the cares and the
[2:01:21] tradition itions of the churches she's
[2:01:23] separated only to God and God is the
[2:01:27] word and as a husband and wife is one so
[2:01:31] does the bride and the word become one
[2:01:34] for the word is living through the bride
[2:01:37] that's how he said that's her
[2:01:39] credentials he said that's her
[2:01:42] identification her identification will
[2:01:44] be with her Lord it will be with the
[2:01:47] word oh Hallelujah if anybody ask who I
[2:01:50] am tell them I am been redeemed Washed
[2:01:54] by the blood of the Lamb identified by
[2:01:56] the word of God oh H that should be your
[2:02:00] identification card not what church you
[2:02:02] belong to not what group you belong to
[2:02:05] not your church membership not where you
[2:02:07] pay ties oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[2:02:10] but are you separated unto God is he
[2:02:13] your all in all is he your everything is
[2:02:16] he the reason why you're living is he
[2:02:18] the reason why you come to church this
[2:02:20] morning
[2:02:23] oh Hallelujah let a man examine himself
[2:02:27] amen said she separated from the cares
[2:02:30] of the traditions of the churches oh my
[2:02:33] it's big she separated only to God and
[2:02:37] God is the word and as a husband and
[2:02:39] wife is one so the bride and the word
[2:02:41] become one for the word is living
[2:02:43] through the bride amen isn't that right
[2:02:45] okay let me skip down here now he says
[2:02:47] if I could pull out a PhD or lld and
[2:02:49] show you my credentials from a certain
[2:02:52] organization or for some school then
[2:02:54] that school would recognize that
[2:02:56] credential he said but the only
[2:02:58] credential a Believer has is the word of
[2:03:01] God living in him declaring Jesus Christ
[2:03:05] lives in that person isn't that right he
[2:03:09] said that's a separate Nazarite unto the
[2:03:11] Lord separated for the word's sake the
[2:03:14] Bible said the word is sharper than a
[2:03:16] two-edged sword cut into the asunder and
[2:03:19] the marrow of the bur of the bone and
[2:03:21] deser the thoughts that's in the heart
[2:03:24] that's the reason Jesus could look upon
[2:03:25] the people and perceive what they were
[2:03:27] thinking he was the word isn't that
[2:03:31] right Hallelujah separated unto God for
[2:03:34] the word's sake not you separating his

[2:04:41] and one will be left every man's got to
[2:04:44] search his or her own heart
[2:04:46] out her own salvation I can't do it for
[2:04:50] you I wish I could but I can't that's on
[2:04:53] you this morning it's on you if you want
[2:04:55] to be saved it's on you if you want to
[2:04:57] repent it's on you if you want to give
[2:04:59] your life to the lord it's on you if you
[2:05:01] want to make things right it's on you if
[2:05:03] you want to rededicate your life to the
[2:05:05] Lord that is totally up to you God not
[2:05:08] holding no gun to nobody head and
[2:05:10] forcing them to love him he that loveth
[2:05:13] me keepeth my Commandments and it is he
[2:05:16] that loveth me and he shall be loved of
[2:05:18] the father and I'm going to come to him
[2:05:21] Jesus said I'll manifest myself to him
[2:05:23] but it's he that loveth me oh Hal it's
[2:05:26] up to you this morning oh hallelujah
[2:05:29] hallelujah
[2:05:30] hallelujah it's not a begging
[2:05:36] contest
[2:05:38] GL Hallelujah God's not begging and
[2:05:41] dragging people into this Kingdom it's
[2:05:43] either you want it or you don't want it
[2:05:45] oh Hallelujah but God put a desire in
[2:05:47] our hearts this morning A Cry of the
[2:05:49] spirit to get into what he has in store
[2:05:52] for us isn't that right Romans 8 uh says
[2:05:55] there there therefore now no
[2:05:56] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:05:59] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[2:06:03] after the spirit isn't that right flesh
[2:06:06] is flesh but spirit is Spirit I'm
[2:06:08] closing out Jesus makes a clear
[2:06:11] differentiation between the two isn't
[2:06:13] that right that which is flesh is flesh
[2:06:16] and that which of the spirit is Spirit
[2:06:18] he said Marvel not that I say unto thee
[2:06:20] you must be born again it's not a
[2:06:23] natural birth it's a spiritual birth
[2:06:26] what made them natural Jews isn't that
[2:06:28] right was a natural circumcision but our
[2:06:31] sign of circumcision today is a holy
[2:06:32] spirit it's a supernatural thing that
[2:06:35] takes place that's what makes us
[2:06:37] spiritual Jews oh Hallelujah isn't that
[2:06:40] right you've got to want that and it's a
[2:06:42] circumcision it's a cutting off of the
[2:06:45] excess flesh it's a cutting off of the
[2:06:48] things of the world it's a cutting off
[2:06:50] of those things that are hanging on to
[2:06:51] you
[2:06:52] are those things that you are holding on
[2:06:53] to that you are putting your trust in
[2:06:55] the Bible says don't put your trust in
[2:06:57] men don't put your trust in princes
[2:07:00] where there is no help but our help
[2:07:02] comes from
[2:07:03] God that's where you got to put your
[2:07:05] trust because when the world begin to
[2:07:08] fall apart when the world which is
[2:07:10] already falling apart when things begin
[2:07:12] to happen your trust can't be in your
[2:07:14] job one day there'll be no more job
[2:07:16] there your trust can't be in your car or
[2:07:18] your house one day there'll be no more
[2:07:20] house there there there be no more car
[2:07:22] there the only thing that you'll be able
[2:07:24] to put your trust in is in the Lord your
[2:07:29] God oh
[2:07:31] Hallelujah I'm getting ready to close
[2:07:33] musician can come amen for to be cly
[2:07:36] minded is death but to be spiritually
[2:07:38] minded is life and peace amen last quote
[2:07:43] and now finish God's word call for total
[2:07:44] separation he said but when a man is
[2:07:47] born in the world for a Believer he
[2:07:50] becomes a Nazarite
[2:07:52] when he separates
[2:07:54] himself uh he becomes a Nazarite watch
[2:07:57] when he separates himself from anything
[2:08:00] that's contrary to the word a total
[2:08:03] separation Jesus said I come to separate
[2:08:05] a man from his wife tear up a
[2:08:08] family that sounds harsh but it's the
[2:08:10] word he said and that won't take uh and
[2:08:13] he he that won't take up his cross and
[2:08:14] follow me is not worthy to be called
[2:08:17] mine a separation from everything
[2:08:20] anything from church from a community
[2:08:23] from a belief or from family or anything
[2:08:26] that would stand between you and
[2:08:29] believing the entire word of God he said
[2:08:32] and if your soul won't punctuate every
[2:08:35] promise for this hour you can start a
[2:08:36] play something softly with an amen there
[2:08:39] is something wrong somewhere he said you
[2:08:42] need a separation Hall oh Hallelujah
[2:08:46] hallel you need a separation this
[2:08:48] morning we need to get away from
[2:08:51] everything
[2:08:52] everything that is hindering us
[2:08:54] everything that is keeping us back from
[2:08:55] our
[2:08:56] blessing but said last Sunday I think it
[2:09:00] was he said what if you were really free
[2:09:02] what if you had nothing holding you back
[2:09:05] what if you had no chains holding on to
[2:09:07] you what if you could really do it what
[2:09:10] would you do would you run the race
[2:09:13] would you believe with all that you've
[2:09:14] got would you do all that you could do
[2:09:17] would you give all that you could give
[2:09:19] what would you do how would you live
[2:09:21] your life life how would you live for
[2:09:23] God and there was one time he also said
[2:09:25] he said what if you had 30 days left to
[2:09:26] live what would you do how would you
[2:09:29] approach life how would you do things
[2:09:31] How would how would you come to a church
[2:09:33] how would your attitude be how would you
[2:09:35] treat your family how would you treat
[2:09:36] your loved ones how would you treat your
[2:09:38] neighbors how would you treat the word
[2:09:40] of God hallelujah hallelujah would you
[2:09:42] search it out in feir and trembling or
[2:09:44] would you be casual with it like you are
[2:09:46] sometimes like we are sometimes we all
[2:09:49] sin we all fall short of the glory of
[2:09:51] God but friends God is calling us higher
[2:09:54] God is calling us to a total separation
[2:09:56] from all unbelief from everything that
[2:09:59] is keeping us back from everything that
[2:10:01] the devil is trying to throw in our
[2:10:02] Direction the lust of the eyes the lust
[2:10:04] of the flesh the pride of life we've got
[2:10:06] to stand that test and in order to stand
[2:10:09] that test there has to be a
[2:10:12] separation you can't continue the same
[2:10:15] way you've been going you can't go on
[2:10:17] the same way you've been doing it all
[2:10:18] the while you've got to separate
[2:10:21] yourself
[2:10:22] from everything that could be a threat
[2:10:24] to your Christianity to your to your
[2:10:26] stand to your testimony the Bible says
[2:10:29] they overcame him by the blood of the
[2:10:30] Lamb by the word of their testimony
[2:10:33] you've got to have something to say
[2:10:35] about how you overcome how you going to
[2:10:37] approach Joshua and Caleb and all these
[2:10:39] Great Men of old who died for the faith
[2:10:41] who Liv for the faith who who who who
[2:10:44] who were parent in Peril and died by the
[2:10:47] edge of the sword as it
[2:10:50] was why you going to see them face to
[2:10:52] face and you've got no testimony you've

[2:25:17] Wednesday we weren't even able to preach

[2:25:43] and this coming Sunday is a very very
[2:25:46] important service very more than Sunday
[2:25:49] rather um in Super Sunday we have two
[2:25:52] services this coming Sunday at 10:00
[2:25:55] a.m. and at 3:00 p.m. brother o and I
[2:25:57] would be speaking the services and um
[2:26:00] it's going to be the Lord's supper and
[2:26:03] it is absolutely
[2:26:05] critical um that you make every effort
[2:26:09] to be here and I'm challenging you and
[2:26:11] I'm pushing you to make sure and call
[2:26:14] somebody who is not here today and let
[2:26:16] them know that they need to be in church
[2:26:18] this coming Sunday in the message let
[2:26:21] your light so shine before men brother
[2:26:23] Bram said for I truly think that is the
[2:26:26] duty of every Christian to take
[2:26:29] communion the Bible said if you take
[2:26:31] this not you have no part with me and I
[2:26:36] believe it is a showdown time for the
[2:26:39] Christians if we do not take it we have
[2:26:42] no part with him and if we take it
[2:26:45] unworthily then we are guilty of the
[2:26:48] body and death of Christ amen so it gets
[2:26:51] to a place where it keeps the Christian
[2:26:54] prayed up when he comes to communion we
[2:26:58] should come reverently solemnly sacredly
[2:27:02] walking up confessing all of our wrongs
[2:27:05] praying one for the other not only that
[2:27:09] listen carefully but we should feel if
[2:27:12] there's a brother or sister Among Us
[2:27:15] that we feel is just a little bit out of
[2:27:17] line somewhere our hearts ought to be
[2:27:19] burdened for that person on communion
[2:27:22] night especially to see them that
[2:27:25] they'll be able to walk up and take
[2:27:26] communion not be condemned with the
[2:27:29] world because they are our brothers and
[2:27:31] sisters and I read that quote to leave
[2:27:34] that burden with the church as we go
[2:27:37] into this week as we prepare for Sunday
[2:27:39] service to take the opportunity this
[2:27:42] week as brother Anthony said to separate
[2:27:44] from the things of the world separate
[2:27:46] from our worldly desires and really
[2:27:48] consecrate ourselves for this coming
[2:27:51] Sunday I I know in my heart God has
[2:27:54] something special for this coming Sunday
[2:27:57] and I really desire that all the
[2:27:59] Christians in the church not the message
[2:28:02] Believers the Christians in the church
[2:28:04] who are really serious about God could
[2:28:06] come prayed up and be identified with
[2:28:10] the Lord Jesus Christ in the Lord's
[2:28:12] supper and be under expectation for God
[2:28:15] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[2:28:17] that we could ask or think I want to
[2:28:20] encourage you as well catch a burden for
[2:28:22] somebody it's so easy sometimes to look
[2:28:24] at your own situation your own struggles
[2:28:27] your own experiences and and focus on
[2:28:30] yourself but many times when you step
[2:28:32] out of you and your stuff and look at
[2:28:36] somebody else and catch a burden for
[2:28:38] somebody else God begins to deliver you
[2:28:41] and all of a sudden you feel but wait a
[2:28:43] minute all I've been looking at was me
[2:28:45] all this time and now I'm praying for
[2:28:47] somebody the weight that I was carrying
[2:28:49] just disappeared
[2:28:50] and that's really what Christianity is
[2:28:52] really about it's about living for
[2:28:54] somebody else because Jesus could have
[2:28:56] looked at himself but he said not my
[2:28:58] will but thine be done because he look
[2:29:01] Beyond his need his pain his situation
[2:29:05] and so that if he didn't do this we
[2:29:07] wouldn't be here today can the church
[2:29:09] say Amen you love the Lord this morning
[2:29:12] lastly there'll be a short choir
[2:29:14] practice after church so once again just
