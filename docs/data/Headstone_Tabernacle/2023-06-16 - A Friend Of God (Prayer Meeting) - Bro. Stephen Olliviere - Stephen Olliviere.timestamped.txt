[14:19] Jesus precious name with thanks given
[14:21] amen and amen praise God thank you Jesus
[14:25] amen God bless you one more time and we
[14:28] want to turn to two portions of
[14:29] scripture tonight
[14:31] uh since James James chapter 2 and Saint
[14:35] John chapter 14.
[14:37] praise God
[14:40] Glory record amen
[14:43] so Saint James chapter 2
[14:46] verse 1 verse verse 23.
[14:53] amen and it says and the scripture was
[14:56] fulfilled which said Abraham
[14:59] which said Abraham believed God
[15:03] and it was imputed unto him for
[15:05] righteousness
[15:07] and he was called the friend of God
[15:11] amen and over in Saint John Chapter 14
[15:14] verse 15.
[15:16] Saint John Chapter 14 verse 15.
[15:22] if you love me
[15:24] keep my Commandments
[15:26] amen
[15:28] praise God heavenly father bless your
[15:29] word one more time we pray in Jesus name
[15:32] with Thanksgiving amen amen
[15:35] praise God
[15:37] so tonight
[15:39] title of this short
[15:41] exhortation is a friend of God
[15:44] friend of course
[15:48] so I'm just talking a little bit first
[15:50] friendship
[15:52] it's a quality that is special to us
[15:57] as human beings
[16:00] as family members as Christian brothers
[16:03] and sisters
[16:06] true friendship enriches Our Lives
[16:11] it enriches our experiences in this
[16:14] journey of life
[16:17] it is an opportunity to share
[16:19] ourselves
[16:21] amen
[16:24] so just talk a little bit before I
[16:25] strike what I want to get at amen
[16:28] I can see please see
[16:31] that everyone in this room
[16:33] tonight has at least one friend
[16:38] or you had a friend at some point in
[16:41] time can we say Amen
[16:44] praise God
[16:46] a friend of all times
[16:49] a friend in laughter and it goes both
[16:52] ways
[16:53] a friend in pain
[16:55] a friend in sickness a friend in grief
[17:00] a friend in need
[17:02] a friend in Joy a friend in Celebration
[17:06] a friend to council
[17:08] a friend when everyone else has forsaken
[17:11] you
[17:12] he or she is still there
[17:16] praise God so a true friend is
[17:19] invaluable
[17:22] so precious that you cannot put a value
[17:25] to that friendship
[17:28] do you have a friend like that
[17:31] you have a friend like that
[17:35] you can trust that person
[17:38] you believe in that business
[17:40] the person is not perfect
[17:43] but you understand each other well
[17:48] and the Book of Proverbs speaks about
[17:51] friends
[17:52] Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24.
[17:55] it says
[17:57] a man that had friends must show himself
[18:01] friendly
[18:03] and there's a friend
[18:05] that sticker closer than a brother
[18:10] so this hints at being genuine
[18:13] and faithful
[18:15] and loyal and supportive
[18:19] even as our lord Jesus
[18:22] he said I will never leave you
[18:25] nor forsake you
[18:27] thank you Lord amen
[18:30] he is the ultimate true friend
[18:33] try to make him your friend tonight
[18:36] and keep him as a friend Hallelujah
[18:42] if you are not friendly or willing to
[18:44] extend yourself to others
[18:47] then no nobody may be inclined to reach
[18:51] out in Friendship to you
[18:55] I remember brother over saying sometime
[18:58] some people's circle of friends is just
[19:01] too small
[19:03] let me extend just to your family
[19:07] but tonight we want to launch out
[19:10] open up your heart to others and extend
[19:15] yourself to others can we say Amen
[19:18] tonight
[19:19] praise God
[19:21] we're still talking amen don't be a
[19:23] turtle in a shell
[19:25] don't be a pickery balled up closed in
[19:29] person
[19:31] suspicious of everyone
[19:33] scared of their own shadow
[19:37] but there is so much benefit to Le and
[19:42] things to learn from others
[19:46] and so much that others
[19:48] can learn and benefit from you
[19:53] so be nice
[19:54] be friendly
[19:57] be a friend
[19:58] praise God
[20:01] on the other hand
[20:03] some people have over 2 000 friends on
[20:07] social media
[20:10] that's cool
[20:12] but we are talking about real genuine
[20:15] friends now
[20:18] some people come around because you have
[20:20] money or or resources that they want to
[20:23] take advantage of
[20:25] and when the money is finished the
[20:27] friendship ends
[20:30] they hang around just to see what they
[20:33] can get
[20:34] Proverbs identify those that type
[20:37] Proverbs 19 Verse 6 he says many will
[20:41] entreat the favor of the prince
[20:44] and every man is a friend to him that
[20:47] giveth gifts
[20:50] right
[20:52] so you are in a position you want to be
[20:54] your friend
[20:56] you are well known they want to
[20:58] associate with you
[21:01] you are a giver they hung around you
[21:05] so there are those types
[21:07] and we look out for them
[21:10] but a true friend
[21:13] is with you through thick and thin
[21:17] always there for you
[21:19] amen still talking tonight
[21:22] amen
[21:24] and a true friend will tell you the
[21:26] truth
[21:28] even if it pains you
[21:32] he will tell you for example
[21:34] I know you may feel bad
[21:36] but I need to tell you that your
[21:39] behavior was off
[21:42] and that was not the way to speak to
[21:44] your wife
[21:45] go and apologize and come back and let
[21:48] me know how it was
[21:50] a true friend will tell you something
[21:51] like that
[21:52] you know he's there with you also and
[21:55] you appreciate the frankness and the
[21:57] straightforwardness of your friend
[21:59] because love is corrected at the same
[22:02] time amen Proverbs chapter 27 6.
[22:05] faithful are the wounds of a friend
[22:09] but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
[22:13] amen so if you are doing foolish this
[22:16] and someone is encouraged it's
[22:18] encouraging you
[22:21] or not corrected you so they encouraging
[22:24] you any foolishness or they are not
[22:25] correcting you that person is not your
[22:28] friend
[22:30] he or she is not seeking your good
[22:33] interest
[22:35] move away from that ship
[22:37] that is not a friendship
[22:40] praise the Lord amen
[22:45] you want somebody to counsel you to
[22:48] advise you
[22:50] to look out for you and vice versa
[22:52] because friendship is a two-way street
[22:55] from verse chapter 27 9 it says ointment
[22:59] and perfume Rejoice the heart
[23:03] so does the sweetness of a man's Friend
[23:07] by hearty Council
[23:11] so be happy when you get good counsel
[23:14] from your friend
[23:17] all right your friend will speak the
[23:18] truth and love a nice rebook rebuke
[23:21] don't pull away
[23:23] just take it in good spirits amen can we
[23:26] see amen tonight
[23:28] so that was just a little encouragement
[23:30] for us to be genuine friends among
[23:34] ourselves
[23:36] but Jesus
[23:38] is our Lord
[23:41] Jesus Is Our Savior
[23:44] Jesus is our healer
[23:48] and tonight we know him as our God
[23:52] healer we know him as Our Redeemer
[23:55] we know him as our deliverer
[23:58] we know him as our strength Giver
[24:02] but tonight
[24:04] is he your friend
[24:07] that's a question
[24:09] to talk about friend before
[24:11] and are you his friend
[24:15] whose friendship is a two-way thing
[24:17] is he your friend
[24:19] and are you his friend we read him
[24:22] in James that Abraham was a friend of
[24:25] God
[24:28] so to be of to be in friendship
[24:31] to be in a relationship it requires two
[24:34] parties
[24:36] two persons in one ship
[24:38] two fellows in one ship two friends in
[24:41] one ship companionship
[24:46] Jesus is a friend that's ticket closer
[24:49] than a brother
[24:51] and in Saint John chapter 15 verse 13.
[24:54] Greater Love had no man than this
[24:57] than a man lay down his life
[25:01] for his friends
[25:06] he has been a true friend to us a real
[25:09] true friend to us
[25:11] he has gone over and beyond for us
[25:15] he gave his all for us
[25:18] and Isaac Isaiah he was wounded for our
[25:21] transgressions
[25:22] he was bruised for iniquities
[25:26] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[25:28] him
[25:29] and by his stripes we are healed
[25:32] he gave us life
[25:35] that we could live
[25:39] and he has never given up on us
[25:42] he's a real true friend tonight
[25:44] Hallelujah
[25:46] do we know him as a friend a true friend
[25:50] when you're down
[25:52] he picks you up
[25:56] what a friend we have in Jesus tonight
[26:00] praise God hallelujah
[26:03] he is always there with us
[26:06] and and you all are Christians you can
[26:08] relate to this tonight amen he's always
[26:10] there with us I can see you saying amen
[26:12] because this is your experience amen
[26:15] he is a father
[26:17] but he is a friend
[26:21] sometimes he picks us up and Carries us
[26:24] when the road gets too rough
[26:27] Hallelujah one songwriter says
[26:31] a friend when sickness lays low
[26:35] a friend when death draws near
[26:39] a friend asked through the veil I go
[26:42] a friend to help and chair
[26:47] another is a friend when other
[26:48] friendships cease
[26:51] a friend when others feel
[26:54] a friend who gives me joy and peace
[26:58] a friend when foes are sealed o praise
[27:03] God he sticks closer than a brother
[27:05] tonight can we say Amen
[27:07] can we thank him tonight for his
[27:09] friendship amen praise God blessed be
[27:12] the name of the Lord
[27:13] thank you Lord you may have a friend
[27:15] from childhood
[27:17] that has remained close to you over the
[27:20] years I have such a friend
[27:23] but things happen
[27:25] the person might migrate or pass on
[27:28] before you
[27:30] or there are times when you may be away
[27:33] from each other for a very long time
[27:35] but this friend
[27:37] he is with you all the time
[27:40] he promised never to leave you no I will
[27:44] be with you always
[27:47] always I will never leave you nor
[27:51] forsake you can somebody say hallelujah

[30:46] get fed up of you
[30:48] but not our Lord tonight not that friend
[30:50] not that friend who will all our sorrows
[30:54] share

[31:21] pray you know sometimes a situation come
[31:25] up and you don't know how to tell
[31:26] somebody you don't know what to say
[31:27] you're afraid to say you don't have to
[31:29] do that with this friend
[31:31] just tell him all about your problem
[31:33] just cast all he cares upon Him praise
[31:36] God tonight so we're the right place and

[31:51] praise God I'm so glad that he is my
[31:56] friend tonight oh praise God nothing
[31:58] like him amen
[32:00] so make him a friend make him your
[32:02] personal friend
[32:04] says
[32:06] he wants to be your body
[32:12] and your body is your real real real
[32:15] good friend
[32:17] you talk about everything you share
[32:19] everything you know each other so well
[32:23] the relationship and friendship is so
[32:25] close that you understand each other so
[32:28] well you know each other so well
[32:32] the quality of friendship of Fellowship
[32:35] is so profound so rich when it's your
[32:39] body
[32:40] when it's a close friend
[32:43] and I remember one time listening to
[32:46] brother Billy Paul given a testimony
[32:49] and he said brother Brian I was praying
[32:52] in the room
[32:55] and he always respected when his father
[32:57] prayed in the room
[33:00] and he's and he was hearing his father
[33:02] prayed and he stopped outside the room
[33:04] and he listened
[33:06] to brother Brown and praying
[33:10] and he heard about him talking to the
[33:12] Lord as if he was his friend
[33:17] then when Billy entered the room very
[33:20] quietly
[33:22] but Ibraham said father excuse me please
[33:26] Billy just entered the room
[33:30] oh hallelujah what a friend what a
[33:33] relationship the prophet had with his
[33:35] Lord
[33:36] it was intimate it was as if he's right
[33:40] there a real friendship and and you know
[33:43] when we talked to God tonight don't do
[33:44] as if God is up there and we are down
[33:46] here he's right here with us he's a true
[33:49] friend
[33:51] making your friend tonight
[33:54] as a songwriter said just to be close to
[33:57] you is what I long to do
[34:00] praise God Amen
[34:03] Abraham was called the friend of God
[34:09] he was the father of feet
[34:11] and he believed God no matter what
[34:16] from a message who is this who is this
[34:20] Abraham
[34:23] Abraham knew the nature of God
[34:28] because he was a friend of God my
[34:31] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[34:33] continues
[34:36] he knew how to take him
[34:39] because he knew that his promises no
[34:41] matter how foolish they looked
[34:43] how simple they looked how unreasonable
[34:47] they looked
[34:48] they were true
[34:50] because God said so and that settled it
[34:54] forever oh hallelujah hallelujah
[34:56] hallelujah praise God
[34:59] continues
[35:01] and that's the way every Seed of Abraham
[35:04] does today and he's talking about you
[35:07] and me
[35:09] that's the way the born-again Christian
[35:11] does today
[35:14] no matter what the world says what
[35:17] science is
[35:18] God's word stands above it all
[35:23] we keep our eyes on what he said can we
[35:26] say Amen tonight just keep your eyes on
[35:29] God's word
[35:30] keep your eyes on God's word amen
[35:33] Hallelujah
[35:35] and said John 15 do you love him
[35:38] yes we do
[35:40] then keep my word
[35:45] keep my word Saint John 14 15 if you
[35:49] love me keep my Commandments
[35:52] how do you sure you love him
[35:55] how do you show he's a friend if you
[35:57] love me keep my Commandments Oh Glory to
[36:01] God David said Thy Word
[36:04] have i hidden or hid in my heart
[36:08] so he hid the word of the Lord in his
[36:10] heart
[36:12] he hit he hid the precious words of his
[36:14] friend in his heart
[36:17] Hallelujah so that he wouldn't fail him
[36:19] Oh Glory David was a friend of God he
[36:21] was a man after God's Own Heart almost
[36:25] finished
[36:27] so since when we become
[36:29] when he becomes your true friend
[36:33] talk about a joy to pray
[36:38] a joy to come into His presence oh
[36:41] Hallelujah a joy to read his word you
[36:44] can't wait to read his word he can't
[36:46] wait to get to his presence you can't
[36:48] wait to tell others about Jesus about
[36:51] your friend because you know him
[36:53] personally he is your friend you're
[36:56] sharing your friend with somebody else
[36:57] amen
[36:58] the quality of your relationship with
[37:01] him gets deeper
[37:03] it gets richer
[37:05] we call it spiritual intimacy you and
[37:09] God you and your friend becoming closer
[37:12] said he made praying a habit
[37:16] or he just was he was at the love of
[37:18] Jesus he just wanted to talk to him
[37:20] every moment of the day he would make
[37:22] praying a habit Oh Glory to God just
[37:25] breathe the holy name in prayer
[37:28] every every moment of the day praise God
[37:32] every day you fall in love with Jesus
[37:35] over and over and over again
[37:41] hallelujah praise God God wants the
[37:44] church to love him
[37:45] he wants that
[37:47] amen and we've got to be on speaking
[37:50] terms with him
[37:51] before we can have spoken word power
[37:56] spoken with power is coming but brother
[37:58] Brian said we have to be on speaking
[38:00] terms with him before we can have spoken
[38:02] word power it will only come to those
[38:05] who have been speaking to him speaking
[38:08] with him who know him who know his
[38:10] nature praise God Amen so we have to
[38:13] become a friend of God we got to know
[38:16] him like Abraham did Abraham knew the
[38:20] nature of God because he was his friend
[38:22] Hallelujah Abraham was a friend of God
[38:25] he knew the nature of God hallelujah
[38:30] and Saint John 15 15.
[38:33] Jesus said henceforth
[38:36] I call you not servants
[38:40] for the servants knows not what his Lord
[38:43] doeth
[38:45] but I have called you friends
[38:48] for all things I have heard of my father
[38:52] I have made known unto you who glory to
[38:55] God Amen Hallelujah you only tell your
[38:58] friends your secret amen no glory you
[39:00] don't tell everybody a secret to tell
[39:02] your friends praise God Amen praise God
[39:05] hallelujah
[39:06] so the songwriter says

[39:27] may your time of prayer be as sweet
[39:30] Fellowship divine
[39:31] sweet communion with Jesus Oh Hallelujah
[39:35] not a monologue a monologue is where one
[39:38] person is talking
[39:40] nobody answering that's not a fellowship
[39:43] and the other give God time to answer
[39:45] back you have to listen to what he's
[39:46] saying back to you not a monologue but a
[39:48] dialogue two people
[39:51] a fellowship with your friend
