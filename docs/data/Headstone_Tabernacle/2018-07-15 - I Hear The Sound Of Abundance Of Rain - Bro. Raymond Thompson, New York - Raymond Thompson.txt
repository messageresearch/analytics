to put things into position for your coming to put things in place for deliverance and for your people to come to perfection to adoption into a manifestation of the prophets prophesy though we thank you for the great victory in the convention last weekend and how you visited us beyond our expectations we thank you for your pouring of your spirit we thank you for the work that is still going on because your word cannot return void but it must accomplish your purpose that you sent it for though we pray this morning anywhere bless this service this morning and you will take complete control we committed over to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ and Lord we have these prayer requests before you for brother Antoine's needs who passed away in the States and Lord for brother Lopez and the Lopez family for their son who passed away we know we want to bring them to your throne and know we want to remember our pastor but over than pray in a special way suffering with that high blood pressure condition law we pray that right now you touch him in a special way Lord from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet lordy enemy would try to attack father because the enemy wants to try to stop what you're doing but it's impossible Lord it's impossible for the enemy to stop what you have already started because you are the author and the finisher father me you visit your manservant right now Lord he couldn't be in the house of God that's a rare thing for him not to be in the house of God so we pray right now as a Church of the Living God that he will visit your manservant but over right now I'm a diesel of the Lord walk into his house may you touch him may you give him a fresh challenge may you bring that blood pressure to normal in the name of Jesus Christ may you heal him completely because the battle is not yet done and we have already guaranteed had the victory love me you anoint him may you touch his wife may you touch this ann-marie and give them straight may you minister to them may you minister to my wife also with that allergy condition Lord may you touch her Lord all those who are tired and weary Lord and the virus and the flu and whatever it is we bring it under subjection under the blood we bring it under the token we bind the works of sickness we find the word subtractors and we declare victory this morning victory in the camp victory in the church victory in the sanctuary victory downstairs victory the toes that are connected on the internet victory wherever this tape is split victory for the bride of Jesus Christ we are not defeated we will not back up we will not give up our families must come Oh glory to God we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen you may be seated [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the season has changed underneath the blood the devil could do no harm when the token is applied and we heard it over the weekend you could bring your family under the token when you bring them under the token it's gonna work itself out because the devil cannot come under the token under the token the devil can reach last that bloodline past that blood barrier and he was started to work in us is more than able to bring it to pass oh I'm excited because we have turned a corner the angel of the Lord Himself he has turned a corner and we want to move with a cloud the cloud of glory is moving hallelujah amen hallelujah so special announcement August the 4th Saturday August the 4th at 5 p.m. there will be a youth service it's a youth oriented service the entire church is welcome so mark your calendars we are on the offensive we are on the offenses we're gonna put the push the enemy back every inch of ground because as Moses left Egypt I love a thing buzz is where the rainbow who said it they took everything with them when they left Egypt they took everything not one hoof will be left behind not a pencil will be

those that are over there are waiting to hear your testimony of how you made it over how you overcame every attack every temptation the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life and you will have a testimony what will it be there's a scene there's a light in the heart compartment there's a scene there's a genetic hold that the devil cannot touch he cannot impact he cannot influence he cannot change that structure and every scene will bring forth after its kind Oh hallelujah no wonder the Prophet could see you are not even the believer but the words seed in you is saying amen to the word when your body doesn't see him and that seed is saying amen to the word when your mind I will say Amen that seed is saying amen to the word of God Oh hallelujah oh what a blessing and we are gonna have to there was so much that was said over the convention it was impossible to have gotten at all so we're gonna have to take some time to go back and refresh and reflect and bask in man amen so this morning we do have a special service this morning and before we get to it I just want to read one quote from the prophet in the message speak to this mountain he said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's gonna come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now and that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she rise to her feet like a mighty marching army and here is your promise the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we are in the process of it now where the Brennan said we are in the process of it now and a process has a beginning a process has an ending a process has a wait unfold so the process has already started we already in the process it's got to happen it's gonna happen but the random said I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's gonna strike the Church of God soon and it's gonna start a revival that'll shake the world I believe it can we get a lot of shorter praise amen so this morning but the Raymond Thompson is preaching at the Omega Christian Assembly in New York by brother palomo and with the fury is there but Rho beta was there and the groups are there so I spoke to Pat a riemann last night message him and I spoke to brother Joey jr. so we want to connect directly to that service to here but a Raymond Thomason bless us again live this morning so brothers if we can switch over I know you will be blessed may the Lord richly bless you this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh what [Music] [Applause] please [Music] Ouiser dangers before him heaven and earth hood my god with [Music] Mauri to God [Music] glory to God amen what a beautiful anointing in the house of the Lord this morning just a few things to say and welcome our guest you stay right there musicians I want to read a scripture Philippians 3:12 2:14 Philippians 3:12 2:14 not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count out myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before us I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I guess if I would give a title to these introduction airy comments this morning is reaching forth to the things before us well good morning church and good morning to all our brothers and sisters in Christ gathered with us and on the hook-up this morning for this special service that the Lord placed upon our hearts to have today it is my spiritual birthday today July 15th 1983 when I was baptized with the Holy Ghost amen mine came after brother Robledo his was June the 8th and I was right there when he was baptized with the Holy Ghost amen so you just had your birthday well the Coleman that day I went to his office he was dealing with someone and I'll never forget it he laid hands on me and he said I perceive you want the Holy Ghost and I had been crying out within and he laid hands on me next thing I know I'm on the floor the white light is flooding into my soul and since that time I've been adding rotting dying that Christ might live in me and that is the desire of everyone gathered in here to manifest the token to manifest Jesus Christ I believe the Scriptures Psalm 133 is perfect for this day behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments so it is beautiful in the sight of God to see brothers and sisters gather together in expectation in unity around the word that is about to be delivered by God's servant brother Raymond Thompson first I want to thank my very special brothers in Christ with a fury and brother Robledo and their wives for their sacrifice to be able to be here today thank you both of you may be seated forgive me if I get a little emotional but thank you for being here today for accepting the invitation and being part of this little I call it mini convention this time years ago we'd be in Penn Harris or just coming home well thank you brothers each one of my brothers are the fury and brother Robledo have contributed so much to the bride of Jesus Christ dedicating their lives for his purpose and together under the ministry of our pastor brother Joseph Coleman we served as young men we obviously older now and we were trained for service for such a time as this brother Fury once preached a message was back in the 70s and it was and the people said amen and how it brought down a special anointing of worship and it showed the people what God expected from them as the reveal word came forth from God's servants and I will never forget it when he read the scripture and say well the people said Amen and you better believe the anointing resounded in the house of God that day the people said Amen and then brother ableto preached a powerful message I believe is back in 2005 I'll never forget it charity anointed faith releases the hidden power on the third face and he was quoting the Holy Spirit gotta hold him so much it was amazing quoting from Christ is the mystery of God reveal he said Christ is the principal theme of a Bible through seven church ages through his seven phone natures to be anointed by charity to release the hidden power the hidden manna underneath the Seventh Seal I will never forget the way he brought that message god bless you brother Fury god bless you brother robe leader true servants of the Living God may be seated how brother Fury and brother Robledo blessed God's people and God's servant with their ministries and they continue to do so in their churches on the field today for me and for this assembly Omega it is a special blessing to once again be together with my brothers in this service and I thank you again for making this a special day and it is so good to see the others out of here I believe brother Andrew knew God bless your brother Andrew what an accomplished musician and servant of God brother Daniel Ciara in the back God has

brother Isaac Ovid and the headstones happen Akal so good to have you as part of this service this morning we love you appreciate your ministries god bless you [Applause] you may be seated and of course brother Raymond Thompson our guest speaker his son Luke is also with us this morning brother Luke his son and how I appreciate I won't be long I appreciate brother Thompson for his phone calls over these past few years in particular always reaching out with concern encouragement and a few years ago when he was passing through he and I went out to brother Coleman's gravesite there we had a very special time together as we both expressed what brother Coleman's ministry meant in our lives in our ministries and how I appreciated his understanding of what God placed on my heart for the little flock out here in Hicksville on Long Island so we the Holy Spirit was there I will never forget the little fellowship that we had maybe less at an hour an hour and a half and I said when you pass through again in the future perhaps you could speak for us and here we are a few years later it's God's time and it's God's season for brother Raymond to bless us with the preaching of the word this morning and speaking to him last week this weekend something that brother Branham spoke of and all of the ministers quote from God's prophet Malachi 4 that God keeps his word and it cannot fail that charity never faileth and brother Branham on that message for 750 we're just over the I've okay and yet I believe it's coming to a time when God's church it's gonna be so cold out like that where all the saints will just set together and the Holy Spirit will just come in like it was on the day of Pentecost heal the people raise up the people and great things I begin to see it happen well that's the way I feel I'm expecting something to happen that is the desire of every servant of God who followed the message of Malachi 4 for that divine love to drop down then came Jesus amen you may be seated and after that brother branham said then came Jesus 1957 and after this morning the Holy Spirit is so beautifully coming down and bathing us in His great beauty it was just inspired to speak them words and say that some glorious day that all the gifts that's in the church will be just set aside on the mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit Himself will just take the church in such control of divine love until the sick will be healed glory to God until the blind will see until the lame bow war until the Deaf will hear sister Virginia without hands being laid on them it'll be one great beauty I believe we are in that season blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen glory to God blade god bless you sister Jessica Luda god bless you good to see you sister God has got something special for you today you may be seated it's a new time it's a new season anything could happen in a house of God blessed be his holy name we come this far by faith and we are not gonna turn back you may be seated glory to God hello yeah hell yeah so that is my desire that is in my heart and everyone gathered here this morning on the hook-up and I believe we are in that season now that is the time we are in where charity never fails what is the Holy Ghost given for well brother Branham said he ties it in right here on that message well that's what the Holy Ghost is given for it gives - gets to give unction to the preacher this morning it's to give holiness to the group it's to set the church in order it's to bring a unity of the spirit it's to unite us together with power his power will unite us together it's to unite us together with love brotherly love I don't care if you're Methodist I don't care if you're Baptist I don't care if you're Presbyterian Lutheran whatever you are if we open by one Holy Spirit baptized into one body members of the body of Jesus Christ if that is so there is nothing present there is nothing future there is nothing in the past hunger starvation nothing can separate us from the love of God from the love of Christ the love of God that's in Christ because you are born of the Holy Spirit you are washed in the blood you have a full blood atonement that's what the Holy Spirit is given for that's what it's for let it be the name of the Lord you may be seated [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God brother branham he said it would be ever so humble and that charity will be the main thing humble thyself I was thinking here brother branham said of one little illustration to back up what he said now we're looking at the watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is watches coordinating with one another we'll never know the correct time and that takes all of us together if we want to see the third pull do something for God and do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together and the devil thinks he had the bride in a corner somewhere this bride is coming out this bride is getting together in the unity of the faith amen to humble ourselves brother Branham seen before God confess out wrong and pray and believe God for these things we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly in the order of the Lord just think if gifts is so great what we call pow1 Paul said though I have faith that I could move a mountain and have not charity I am nothing think of that and though we say well I understand though I understand all the mysteries of God and still though I could do it and have not charity I am nothing see I ain't got nowhere yet I love the way brother Brian brings it I ain't got no way a main thing he said his love the love of God humble yourself with that love and when it is in one's heart this love it will bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love this vine till this morning I pray that God use his servant in a mighty way that we draw closer together we're brothers and sisters we draw closer a new and fresh anointing and in this last quote begin to play more than before I need you the end time seats i3 1962 for the Brenham said and ever who laid the little welcome mat out here in the street I noticed well that was fine I think it was brother I'd like maybe if the Lord be willing some time where we could come for a season of services get with this fine pastor and others and get a meeting set up four or five nights where we could sufficiently advertise and get all the churches together because you know not we need one another right now more than ever Oh more than ever we ever did in all the history of the world is right now we need each

may you press the your word it's already anointed so is the message you send us anointed but now my you anoint us O God in Jesus precious name we ask it church are saying have you Bibles I am going to be an Old Testament three scriptures first Kings 18 41 to 46 Ezekiel 34 26 and Zechariah 10 verse 1 and I abut the Joey's sing the chorus that chorus for a purpose thank you mother Joe beautiful so you know the whole story but we will just take you from verse 41 any lightest it onto a get the up and eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so a abou end up in a eat and to drink and he lied to win up to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and he put his face between his knees and he said to his servant go up now look towards the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and he came to pass at the seven time that he said the whole day arises a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say unto area prepare the chariot get thee down and and that the range-topping not in others that urgent it's more urgent than what you realize and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and they abroad and went to Jezreel any air and the hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he covered up his loins in the rain before a yet to the entrance of Jezreel Ezekiel 34 just one scripture day verse 26 and I will make them and the place is round about my you oppressing and I will cause the shower to come down in the season in there shall be showers of blessing not maybe they shall be showers of blessing just one more day in Zechariah teen the first one it's an ASCII of the Lord rain in the time of the letter e so the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in the field not to some grass to everyone so everyone this morning you cannot receive a blessing make order the blessing the reading of this word you may be seated so this morning possible almost said so much so I don't need to deal with that subject the sister Joann and sister Becky sang so much about the same subject so I don't have to deal with it all you and I have to do is get into action upon that subject I mean I have a title I hear the sound of abundance of rain amen then my subject ask for rain in the time of the latter rain so there's a season for this to happen and when the season is on you ever write to ask and my inspiration they shall be showers of blessing and I believe this morning we already felt some showers of blessing so I'm gonna float on the quotes for a bit says he and Genesis 111 let every seed bring forth of its kind so every seed according to the Word of God must brief off of its kind if it's a pumpkin it will bring forth pumpkin if it's an orange it will bring forth oranges this is young gods power to transform when he put the seed in the earth the sea can only come forth with the power of life within it if you transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was he is transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be my so so so let's see there will be a pumpkin will be an orange a peach tree has the potentials in it and I'm speaking just of the seed now as the potentials in it to transform itself into a tree so I give you the seed and you say but I see nothing but when you you put it in the ground and it goes through the process then every leaf and every branch and every fruit is already in that seed because it has the power to transform itself into the species now so everything is there so for time sake now promises we made up of body spirit soul and then he was just dealing with it before that Christ will in his own word he says but down on the inside now is speaking of the soul the next velum the third realm is the soul and that's pretty stated by God Oh hallelujah that now watch his neck stood face with real sea germ lays it lays in the soul now the devil might get you messed up in the flesh but he can't touch your soul he might make you fall and get my make mistakes but he cannot touch the seed German your soul because that's where the real CDs and that sieve is planted by God and in their lives every promise like it is in the natural so it is in the spiritual you may be seated and in their lays every promise in you right now is adoption he say me problem yes because the see German the soul has the potential to be adopted to in his perfection in their lives and other Ephesians in the laser resurrection hallelujah in the rapture it's already in you my in there is a seventh under revival oh I love their brother Raymond I don't see just you wait the wild brother hallelujah there's a tank coming and I believe it's for now that we're gonna see is something happened like we never saw before brother hallelujah and when the rain falls on the seed it can only manifest what's on the inside I see a car like a man's and we don't never come like a man's end but we have a cloud of seven angels hallelujah you better chuck away your raincoats take away your umbrellas because it's going to rain mark you may be seated so the seat can only manifest the life that's on each side of the seed he says here now he says so I put it there's been three seats on a nice piece of old Roberts Polygram and then he couldn't say William premises and the word has been sewn on Robert suit seat for the Pentecostals pulley cream for the denominations but in turns around he says and the word has been sold now now then who was the one who saw the word and he says every city's got to bring fourth of its kind he says the Pentecostals will get more Pentecostals the denominations bully cream will get more denominations but you know what it says but the word is gonna produce sons and daughters of God hallelujah praise God if they got more Pentecostals if they got more denominations well then this is coming - there's gonna be sons and daughters of God upon the face of the earth that is coming - Amen hallelujah he says look at the great letter rain what is it supposed to do and how they would run and leap over walls and how they'd be in once an army coming he says you just wait a minute aha the kind of crop you get is a kind of seed you put in the field now he says they'll run in leap over walls he says is this the sign of the answer what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapture in faith now what I'm preaching is not that you don't know this has been preached over and over which is anointing it again we just taken it again in chocolate in the enemy's face to let them know there's gonna be a rapture to let him know there's gonna be a revival and nothing would stop it brother what if it is - something to let us know how but the chance to enter into rapture in faith easy when we run in leap over walls is there something fixing to happen that is all marvel bodies are gonna be changed can I love to see it all or is it so close that our seat is thus the generation sirs by prison what time is it we are yet so brother branham 962 felt already that this is about to happen he says the Lord is he so close I can feel it is it gonna happen in my day but they didn't happen in his name but there's another people in the land Oh hallelujah and I believe you the part of their people there's another people in the land who under the messenger will be the final voice to the final age she will become the mouthpiece of God hallelujah should speak for God Oh hallelujah it's also my subject here you must watch the latter Lane is the point I'm bringing now what's the matter now she's now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces the fruits hallelujah so when that rain falls brother it will produce the fruits and when the fruits begins to come it means it's harvest time then you mean it means the sowing season is over so lord help us together token now we need to have it now we have to apply it now because they come a time when it has to go on display and when it's displaying time you can't apply mine so he said yeah every seed will bring forth of its kind now I like this one in masterpiece brother Bello it says at the harvest time the series back to the original condition in other words it went through all the stages it says young and must have all the word in order to be the see now what is next word it says now you can't ever alpha seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed man come on now you can't ever half a seed in other words you can't take part of the message you can't say no I believe only this and I only take that no you've gotta take the whole seed and the whole seed will bring forth a harvest you cannot plant our four seed it won't grow hallelujah good to see you so so so we got a plan to every promise I can't just haven't believe this and I believe in the snow I gotta take the whole thing and that will bring our mamas to the to the season I've planted my know you may be seated now I normally don't say this but I I want to get through this now now I told in Minister one time I said a brother you can't so I did it and then and expect to reap love you want to say what I'm saying so so we when you sow the seed then is what you're gonna reap and though you saw it where people might not see it but you see when the harvest comes when the rain falls then we see no no no matter what you said here if you're not sewing from here in the time of the harvest you're gonna be ashamed you're gonna stay in the shame you gonna know what to do so brother I talked about the broom we spoke I said you know it's time we go into action we can't say that all the time love one another forgive one another I mean we seen it but I'm told we must put it into action so know what the send me something process you know the biggest enemy has seized is himself and we make enemies of other people but the biggest enemy is yourself and he says you know a dead man you can kick him ills oh my the bodies will just you can curse him and that body will just list off you can swim you can stomp on him it is a dead man but you see they stone to many of us that's alive oh you rub someone the wrong way brother and you'll see what comes out but this morning I believe is a cloud this rain there's a power this design that occurs here through Europe seeing the Undertaker's here brother - let us die die to ourselves mine I feel not knowing on there but the fury so you see you maybe see we are challenged by that you know suddenly someone comes along my name we don't get along so good and all of a sudden we'd we make a u-turn or we go the opposite direction you see what God is gonna keep that person there until you die you can run from this church to another Church there's gonna be another person there just like that person oh my god is smart man he knows how to kill us all this happens so that we must die and I this thing for the person is to die because we want to be right we want our way we want to I'm gonna get back at him I'm waiting my chance and for years I walk with that thing now just waiting for one loop oh brother Branham says three kinds of believers he says you have the unbeliever you have the make-believe and you have the believer the believer believer he says but the West guys is a make believer he says he'll wait all his life just to get you and find the loophole and brother he says that the most dangerous guy but I believe I'm speaking to believers this morning so again four times that you may be seated he says in original seed he says there of the word Moriah which means the teaching brain and this is the teaching rain and then you have a harvest rain and some of the small and when we woke up it was raining another my I'm preaching this morning I hear the sound of abundance of rain and all week it was good weather but when I got up I said man Lord it's raining made rain in here man my flirtini earth must flat out here oh so he says there's a full rein this is the foreman right now I'll just cut it short he says is you're teaching rain it says then the the latter rain let your harvest rain and that brings this is where he said it brings that starts your crop growing then just before it matures there comes another rain a purposes that's what they call the harvest rain I mean I went with these spring rains right about June it makes your crop now the rain we find out was the Spirit so the rain is the Holy Spirit and so teaching rain former rain and then you have your harvest rain which is the letter rain that makes your crop oh that's very important because you can have the seed but you don't have the rain there's nothing to cook in the seed so we need the rain friends we need every blessing we walk in that door we must come in here so hungry so thirsty so anointed so played up so hungry that that that God sees that and that he fills us out that when we leave our our lives are changed the same is quickened and and the pastor don't have to come in no you already anointed you came with your fire you can't prayed up you dropped your odds there's no more grudges you don't feel funny when you see someone you know what I'm saying because your love is grown in sister Peggy so if I have no charity if I didn't grow it shows I'm still immature but brother when you meet mature people oh my goodness Oh there'll be a revival in this place I tell you New York will be shaking like never Bishop before Oh hallelujah he said yes original city and speaking of the disciples he says they hold themselves to the upper room now listen to this this these were the seeds the seeds was a word and the word was lain in they without life on it now they walked with Jesus for three and a half years and they had the seed in them but no life yet that's why Peter could deny the Lord he even had a revelation and it's that what he said so you can't even go in on your revelation mainly said well I have a revelation that's good but you see it takes revelation and manifestation when the two gets together then that's the interpretation so you can tell me all of your revelation but brother the manifestation speak for itself and all of a sudden they came a song from evidence the waters begin to gush down and actually felt all those where they were sitting and the seeds what sir now begin to grow but Jim right so it says and they begin to manifest itself and the Word of God was being made manifest so watch it then they went to the up room they had the seats there but there was no life on it and then they were waiting for the promise and all of a sudden suddenly the Bible says here come the waters and begin to cast down where did it go brother it never went to Caiaphas it never went to the temple it went to and the seed was that's why it's so important to have the seed in you [Applause] hallelujah it's important we have the right seed it's important to have the seed sowed in your heart because I'm telling you the rain is coming I hear the sound of the bundles of rain I hear the promises I hear there's gonna be a revival I hear this who's gonna be changed and continued my brother our children is coming man I don't care how backslidden they are are they coming I hear the sound of abundance of rain you made me see that promises they were even cowards the disciples who come words but they hold themselves with a broom the seeds planted by the son of man for three and a half years the season had no life in him and then all of a sudden the waters begin to gush down and begin to grow and manifest himself Jesus says he planted the seeds the Holy Ghost reign manifested the sea and out they went the disciples then they watch now the seeds went to life a few days before they they had nothing what you see it turns overnight yummy today Saints it turns overnight suddenly suddenly changes and all of a sudden Leah come the water and God and thrown himself on Peters heart and all of a sudden Peter became the spokesperson the very one that denied him the very one that everyone looked down upon God raised him up maybe in the spokesperson sit on his heart hallelujah set upon his heart and all of a sudden what happened there was a change and everyone thought this is the same old Peter brother no it wasn't it was a different Peter why the Holy Spirit came upon the seed quicker needed to life and brother there was a different man now now I send himself upon the floor and you remember Ananias and Sapphira they tried to like speed no brother there was a change I wanna tell you there's a change coming God is coming upon your heart you keep pressing you keep going no matter it might look like you're a coward but you keep going brother but be sure you in a broom Judas walked out to remember he walked away but Judas walked out but Jesus about Peter walked in hallelujah better be at the right place we metanoid did strikes home you better be at the right place hallelujah my I went to the temple they from the man they and he says a servant called but none but such as I have you see immediately they knew that something had happened you may be seated such as I have rise up and the Lord went to that LHS confirming the word with signs wonders and the Bible says they were ignorant in unload but they take heat they took heed they were with Jesus now it says here this is a bit of a hard one spoken over the original seat and what they trying to do they trying to manufacture a letter rain not it's my subject nonsense why the letter Lane will sweep the whole brother so you see that's what I'm looking for that's why I'm here that's why wherever I go I look for that promise i anointed to myself i anointed upon the people and you won't believe I came then I said then something says this message you gonna preach is prophetic so I'm prefer sign over you that you're gonna have rain and there's gonna be showers or blessing on your life brother it's gonna be a change your children is coming your money's coming now I don't get where they are they might be backslidden they might be prostitutes drug addicts but because there's a token they out there come on man there's a token out there you may be seated I want you to listen to this if you remember brother Evans went to the Branham tabernacle they stole his car he told brother Branham Princes let me go in prayer when did you pray he caught caught the guy in pray and the thief was driving all the way down but brother Branham caught him in prayer amen we had a message man we got a message on Power Man ne crois team and you know what they did he send the token of team he sent Holy Spirit and all of a sudden while the thief is right in the way he feels convicted there comes appraisers in the car the man makes a u-turn on the chance he drives back again hallelujah he parks the car he leaves the keys and he starts running out there [Applause] man another man comes out of prayer and it goes to brother Evans he said from the heavens your guys parked it so so place everything is still in the car it says the petrol that was used that's all now I wanna say this to you parents into every one of you if God would go after a motor car and bring it back my plane what about our families what about our children brother if we can send Holy Ghost and say Lord bring him back my child my daughter bring back my son bring back my mother God will bring a multi-car how much more families [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother motor come back a piece of junk still that's so brother that car must be rusted I mean you might not even find a part of it but you know when he brings your son in your daughter back they'll be with you for eternity brother hallelujah so all you got to do this morning speak their names speak the word for them let them I let it be let it be a conviction let it be a returning on my children go after them this morning it's for you and your household man so that's why I mean I am thinking in the words of Malachi for John my word is his word we ain't got all ready all night this message is already fornicators I don't have to wonder Kate it was predicated by the pull of fire when he created by an angel brother we just brother we are going back the words of Malachi for there's gonna be a bride I don't know what goes wrong this bring to be a bride Plus Slayer the Lord is going to be a bride my you maybe see this so parents don't give up on your children don't give up on your family God is able to bring them he says all we need is mothers of old to pray conviction upon the children and that's what brother man did with AK I said Lord convicted man oh you see God change the whole thing he thought is getting away oh man that's Holy Ghost me brother the world didn't give it to us and the world can't take it away hallelujah no man gave it to us and no man can take it away hallelujah he says when that let rain sesor you won't even be allowed to open your mouth it says it were when that when that literally could produce affiliation the Pentecostals and all those groups all come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that would listen to it he won't even be allowed to open your mouth right that's when he'll come that's when it will show that's when you'll see rain oh my little Oh be quiet just let it go [Music] so you see we don't have to actually do anything just like stir keep serving the Lord someone is nice to you lady stone blessing I like what about the Communists disable say bless them that curse you he says that curse comes here comes your blessing it says it meet the curse goes back and the blessing comes back Oh so let's keep blessing brother he says listo be quiet hallelujah so in the time of lettering that's when they're being affiliation you won't be able to open your mouth that's when you come that's when you so that's when you will see rain and we're looking for that rain I can't manufacture this this will speak for itself so you see you can't manufacture yeah what I'm saying again so when you do that provinces that will be peacock feathers so so you don't manufacture the wool don't manufacture it produces oh you you show you man you cut them shame and but next year the wool is back again you don't you didn't ask him please manufacture me some more it's in it's in the nature now you men must begin what's already in the seed that produces so when you become a lamb and you're a sheep that is in you it just automatically you humble you you oh god help us he says here anytime see sign in the latter rain if the latter rain would have been here the power of God would strike the thing and she there's rebel the latter rain is fixing to come once the matter the church is manufacturing the cells something just like II tried to do she tried to have more light to manufacture something we've done the same thing trying to make something in ourselves keep your hands or feet let God do it take his wouldn't believe it and hold it in your heart and when the rain begins to fall life will take hold and the word will manifest itself that's what I'm looking for brother one of these days one someone is gonna say the right words and the rain will come down and the world will manifest itself will walk out the freedom all so free brother will be able to send us it free will be able to say those that are bound free we be able to speak the word let the cancer leave let the believer let that because leave why because the word manifest itself mm brother Joe this thing is real man hallelujah he says and I'm see sign but the Word of God has been sowed also and when the Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of God will love in the people the false bride has committed adultery when brought herself into crease and sold out the price will reward a confederation of church that's to be bound and burned like the phones and vessels but where the word has been sold into the people's heart it will reap a bride for Christ as certain as I'm standing here so as as a word has been sowed into your hearts he says that will rip a bride for Christ oh you you should appreciate your minister he's preaching the Word of God brother that's gonna produce a bride for Christ it will be prideful price hallelujah the false bride will Reaper will Council of Churches but the word that's been sold will reap a prideful Christ brother there's nothing gonna stop it but the chance the more I think of it man nothing can stop that we think things go wrong but with garbage going right I don't know if I must say this I said it before remember Jonah he was supposed to go down to none other but the man goes down to Tasha's disobedient and what he does goes through the bottom of the ship and goes in sleep on the job and while he's laying there all of a sudden she's in trouble the shop they chucked over the cargo and everything and it's still in trouble eventually they finally maybe says oh you know the story and he thought well if I if I can commit suicide get rid of me it would be okay chuck me over and then they charted he told him sorry I'm the problem Chuck me over me they only talked him over what did God do had a mess of fish they repaired fish swallowed him Francis went to the bottom of the ceased there's two day for three nights a late day third day thing shakes up swims all the way Shh yeah through the waters where is it going to none of her brother misses it none of her worship the fish God and he comes right up to the banks opens his mouth Aeneid Jonah comes walking out this is when he preached all sincere repentance now when we looked at it we know Jonah was back slidden something went wrong the man was out of the world the man made the biggest mistake Jesus comes around in Matthew he says as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days in three nights so must the Son of Man belly of the earth for three days and nights so the man wasn't best little man we think it went wrong no we twins right oh yes fire year man you may be seated so you see when we we as human beings we think things go wrong it doesn't not with God and if it looks wrong it works to these wool hey hey God is smarter and if you don't add I'll actually you gonna you in for problems you better die as quick as you can because you're gonna be faced with challenges I'd rather face it now give me Lord kill me kill me take Lord I want to die to myself wow the let rain will speed the world there was nothing much there they won't be able to shut them up because they're gonna take them up so the harbor's rain now watch what this is Kenya in the church ages God isn't gonna plant a new church but it's gonna bring east or regional planting back to original seed he's doing it as stated in verse 23 the Chhotu by the teaching rain of the former rain next yeah what it says next we'll come to harvest rain well theory or rapture in faith oh I hope you caught that he says we had the former name but next will come the harvest rain actually faith know what these are actually free you mean the latter rain barrel Raymond that we're waiting on that will bring the rapture afraid yes you see a power like you never seen before pepper green rapturing face that would be the thunders we made man it will be the bride's revival for show how to go that let the rain is fixin to fall wait to them seven thunders at nights after that group hallelujah it was slicing Cardinals shop heavens so the leper a brother he says is as leper in harvest rain or rapture in faith you choose what you want to call it but rather I like it you're actually faith and there's only one thing that gives you Reb to be faith that's at seven thunders brother believe me from being underneath that seventh seal to keep the pride ratcheting faith and while the word has been preached you get him straight in there brother you don't know God is heading all the time and you've been pulled up we thank God for what they did and what is gonna do but right now you know what is he doing he's giving you faith forward brother Raymond for the rapture my you maybe see this he says here the seven thunders will give the bride reps in faith show how to go prepare for correct translation faith they change them of the body that's all I like Jesus keeps all his appointments I says that's the way God is brought his church from justification sanctification peps of the Holy Ghost and now the Ministry of the Spirit which is what quickens the word that ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like his so all the years we had the teaching brain for moraine we had the word with her with the word but in this hour now comes the latter name and he says it's the Ministry of the Spirit so the Spirit comes down now and minister to the word that's already in you and that would be exactly like the minister he head okay can I preach now okay he says now spoken originals he see now why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed that i planted for the body he says the rain is gonna fall pretty soon I mean the real rain and it's good to have seen two fallen I hope I live to see it do you understand our congregation says Amen it will be the Living Word as it was in the beginning the spoken word of God heavys power what sees him in his own body working his way but the joy I went to look up brother Branham didn't use the word soul he says I be zealous of the seed that I planted oh you better stay with me ya know there's a difference between sowing and planting you know what I said what goes out that's what it does but when you plant something brother you dig a hole you you make sure that's always deeply enough man old what's gonna be planted then you make a whole day in there and then you put the seed in there there's a difference between sowing and planting so brother ben says I've been very zealous of the seed that I planted for for the body so we not talking of denominations and Pentecostals and Catholics now I'm worried what did he plan for the body I want to know what did he plan for me for you oh and I'm yet to stop you gotta find out what's been planted not sold because if you read Matthew I happy there he says the sower went out to sow some Feldman's rocks and he says there was no earth so they didn't grow deep enough when the Sun came up its scourge them and what happened they fell away some were sown among stones and when they came up the phones begin to tow them and they were there the way oh my goodness hallelujah and there's no tip and that some fell among phones and other ones he said some fell amongst only groans only places no depth he says others was just laying on the ground you may be seated watching out suing the others was just laying on the ground and this is the fault of the a just came in took it in other words you hardly out of the service and the phone's already come and they take that seed I challenge the church back home I said you know if I must ask you what scripture was irate immediately after the meeting many people will be ashamed you know what I'm saying so we can't play Church anymore we too far off the road you can't be on the fence even you gotta take a stain and say yeah I stay let the whole world know doesn't matter it doesn't matter oh come on go yeah I stained mother says he like someone that Spain's for something right Oh mom what is staining but when you get a guy that's on the fence you never know he's either gonna fall that way or that way brother take someone that knows way stainless as a revelation it is not the word has been so many soul brother there's nothing using this has come that has come but the main sense pain how are you still standing it's not me something is only needs not myself but something holding me I mean no matter what happens something holds you [Applause] so he said I've been zealous and I looked up that word zealous oh my there's so many meanings fervent ardent it says you're passionate devout devoted committed dedicated enthusiastic eager key my she the toes have been zealous all that fancy day so you think he just now all that has been preached but he planted seeds for the body so you can have a whole teaching on Rome and what the book it's not helping me I'm not gonna be I went over there you're not gonna be here but tell me what any plan for the body so when you pull out that and bridge that to me that excites me brother that makes me feel I wanna come back to church I don't want to come into a holding in adventure no I want something with this life something that quickens our word in my soul and it brings me to life brother that's why people you find out they only wanna go to church because the church is paid but if the church is alive hey brother I tell you they can't wait for the doors to open why because the word is gonna come home quicken their souls and bring the word that's in them to life Amina I feel the Noize in your mind I feel the freedom of speaking like this I feel I mean freedom or say the Holy Spirit say say brother Paloma speak the world over the people [Applause] my so he planted special a brother Robledo exclusive pride promises so this that we preach you maybe see that is for the bride that's why we preach it the way we do you say vibranium I had it a thousand times I don't give you thirty ten thousand times one day it's gonna take life amen Peter said though you know it but I'm only putting you in remembrance your pastor preach it but the common priest it on the random fish eat the minister's preach it but one days old it comes alive one day when they think of you no dead no utilize you come to life he knew the rain is coming the real rain now watch what he said someone this is so beautiful I'm still on time a thank you he says he has someone I listen to this so beautiful blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night watch he shall be like a tree planted where planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever ye do not prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind drives away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish so how I was in prison what is planted is not stuck [Music] he's planted now promises now plant in divine language planet blessed is that man that will not assembly sell food the scoffers and make fun calling the true church a bunch of fanatics it shall not be like the three he says he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water God has put him in a choice pot now yes something striking about this tree its way explanted many trees but this black tree the series watch which is planted fruit shall not wither you bring forth his leaves and fruits in the season what David were dead this man is blessed he will be planted not just stuck out set out you know he says I know like seen anything planted he says wisdom was his faith it wasn't set out he shall be like a tree set out Transpo's from this now planted what then his next words predestinated that thought of God before the foundation of the world placed in vain c-notes background by chance planted by predestination [Applause] hallelujah man that you make you shouting jump you got stuck in here do not here by chance you are predestinated [Music] hallelujah I feel twice my size mana hallelujah listen man he says he won't just transpose or said there but you were being a fourth of god please they're not stuck out by chance but planted previously what to the rivers of water now what because you planted by the rivers of water his route shall never wither hallelujah sizzle prophet though he dies I'll raise him up again in the last days this night but the coments is a common they coming back brother they were planted by the rivers of water he says to be there not just by chance he was pretty estimated to catch the word when it was sold and she'll be right there when it sticks he says he planted not just stuck down he actually planted so this is what made me realize that promises planted there's a big difference brother so once you plant it it's not by chance that's my sister's boning I don't believe you here my chance then he turns around he says there's a lot of difference between sticking a stick in a ground then planting something it's different the seed was planted and it found its roots homes when the water begin to come in and pray forth in life the spirit oh yeah he's the SS what the restoration the sixties where was it planted as David saw it and he spoke and he said for the job blessed is a man and notice he said he could not die his lease would not wither no no no no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree they tried for 2,000 years to kill the tree it's what they will never kill the tree they tried how many years they start couldn't kill the tree the tree keeps growing hallelujah [Applause] he says here why it's where it's planted that's what does it it sways planted he's planted by the rivers of water now notice they will save his roots will die what if a man is planted in such a thing by the river with the springs he says nine different Springs feeding into him what an establishment he is and a man thus planted by the river the spirit of water rivers of water oh one water one spirit they are gifts of healing spirit of prophecy spirit of this but many gifts but one Giver my-my-my he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water my God bless you may be seated you know why because you planted by the rivers of water he says nine streams but the same river same water same giver healings prophecy my roots of the Spirit faith virtue knowledge temperance patience traffic flowing through you I your roots is there you plant the bed a little they try to pull you out but they just can't get you out you routed a you've been blowing through the spoons in the sway in that way but brother when you come right back to you know what you stronger because your roots win deeper hallelujah they just come for you there's something that holds you your boots is there you planted by the rivers of water and you cannot wither they expect you to be down they expected to have no joy every time they meet you you got a smile on your face every time they meet you you got love in your heart you got forgiveness brother why you by the rivers of water that refers every vitamin you need that every vitamin you need is in that river program and I can't forgive well maybe you must check where you plant it cause if you planted by the rivers of water brother every vitamin is there it takes away all the foolishness it takes away all that nonsense the pettiness it takes it away brother and the genuine love of God comes in your life and you rise above the situation you maybe see that I want to show you this illustration and I did it one time since then you will remember but another poem you know many times we we go through situations in life but you see the trouble is e yeah yes all the situations and people and many things and yes yeah we are but you know when you add on the same level whatever comes your way it buffers you because you're on the same level and sometimes you feel to retaliate because you're human your emotions come up but you're on the same level and the Holy Spirit showed me this years back how do I overcome I can't take this person Simon turn it and say you know you gotta do it you can't do that so the Lord showed me you know what you must do don't stay on the same level go I am so in whatever they say comes before these to affect you but now you will die here so it comes [Applause] tell your story walking there I win I you man I'm a PI that's what his father said - each one and when he was hired he was in the spirit then the mention of things of the earth didn't affect him anymore maybe someone in this meeting needs to go higher that's only good to do go higher and you know by even going higher you'll win your brother perhaps because it's he'll see doesn't affect you you win your sister you maybe see that my okay I'll have to try to win now I don't like to preach a long drive elevation oh good but I must I must be honest it's good to be here I feel so free I feel anointed [Applause] [Applause] so I got us almost say things in a veiled way but I know you're reading it this brother brems says you've got to respect another man is poopit but I'm saying things but I can see you catching it without saying it you know back home I wouldn't you know but I gotta respect your food and these men are God and the people that came today to listen this message is to encourage you I want to say there is the preachers I just like to encourage people you know so I hope this encourage you to realize that what's in you is so great it's so powerful and in that seed is the power to transform itself you might not see me sometimes for years you know I see I already seen that you know a concrete slab it can be as thick as that and one blade of grass because it's got life in it well like no this is my employee it cracks a concrete slab with steel reinforcement mother theory but then braid because it's got life in it it pushes all the way and gets up when it forces there oh it does it I don't know it causes life in it nice life in you brother this is not a situation I don't care how many concrete blocks the enemy puts on you you are coming through brother you're gonna crack it you're gonna break it you're gonna come out of there you coming out of that slammer I don't care what the devil put on you you coming through that brother and you know I seen brother Robledo if he doesn't connect the block it will grow out on the side but is this coming up brother I tell you God will make a way for you I don't know a way he's gonna do it I don't know how he's gonna do it but one thing I know he's gonna do it keep pressing keep pressing keep pressing my brother burner you maybe see that you came from beyond the curtain a time and the angel told him keep pressing yumemi ask him as i go back to that old carcass he says and then the boy said when you woke up keep pressing there's a work for you stuff to do this work for us to do why do you think God is on this planet oh there's a work for you to do man don't shirk your responsibilities hallelujah my so the now I like this honor the prophets world at this moment is hanging over Rome and what they supposed to do it's hanging over the Antichrist and what he's supposed to do with prophets what is hanging right over the world countable churches and what they supposed to do the prophets word is hanging over all the branches sodomites and what they supposed to do but the prophets word is also hanging over the prize my I say over every person here this morning that 7th Underwood hanging over you with a promise Joseph scoot hanging over you brother so much so that he cannot even see your mistakes because when he looks down he sees the blood he sees the rainbow color coat so we can't even see your mistakes so don't let the devil condemn you because you made a mistake and I feel you can't come back to God promises been the quickest thing to do repent then come back he says and God says in his word he's faithful and just to forgive you so you walk around you run away you do everything but all this is just confess your sin and I'm faithful and just to forgive you so easy and it puts you back in mine so he planted the Italian see paralysis from Serpent's seed right until this is the message of the former rain then you rejected another regional branch to bring forth so okay now watch out like this on Matthew 15:30 and we said every plant which my Heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up so you see everything that's in your life that's not planted by God God is gonna uproot it you see brother a man die better with us for years brother don't you or a man heal yourself to God and what she wrote it cause he didn't plant the temples not of God says a Lord take it away and the oldest water comes in a meeting like this and approves it my you go free of her but she go three of things that has you bound you you you over suddenly the spoken word is read your Bible you pray you like you never prayed before he restores the joy and I said this in Trinidad you know it in Psalms of the one David says Lord he says the song day that you even sing brother Joe cleanse me from all my unrighteousness give me a clean out it says there and he says but don't take your Holy Spirit away from me David in the Old Testament already knew about the Holy Spirit hallelujah he said take everything Lord take every but don't take your Holy Spirit away from me mother that should be every prayer here this morning Lord take my home you can do whatever you want but Lord I do want to lose the Holy Spirit I need to have the Holy Spirit upon my life can they hated me a clean heart and restore within me the joy of my salvation but don't take away the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament on the Paloma David already spoke of the Holy Spirit how much more now when it's given oh god bless you may be seated my is gonna prove it he's gonna take it out he's gonna take the depression away he's gonna take the funky habits away he's gonna uproot the malice he's gonna uproot the hatred and I'm speaking about the roots he says uprooted know I seen back home when sometimes I Drive away you know in the paving the grass grow and you try and pull it out but the roots remain there and next week it's right back there brother we're but not so what God he takes it out put roots it's not coming back again Hey all

ship of the Furies viore thank you I trust goddess bless you hallelujah amen god bless you so good to see you thank you for coming chemists salute Oh bravo fury god bless you [Applause] mine you may be seated so he's gonna uproot it and I'm speaking from the roots so okay Elijah we read the scripture and the Bible says he told His Messenger all of a sudden now remember there was a drought for for three and a half years and he told am not even do Rhema for unless it come by my word so there was a drought and then they begin to look for Elijah and when they found him the AFC's years who won the trouble of Easter I said ah you got it wrong you blaming the wrong man you the one that caused the trouble he was the one that's brought the problems so don't blame me he says but listen you better go eat and drink because I hear the sound of abundance of rain listen you better go have you last time go have your Joel in the world go do it for the law but is for me I hear the sound of abundance of rain brother listen it was really a true child of God he would have stayed with Elijah but the Bible says he went to go eat and drink you know what I'm saying he's the wind in the face of that but brother Elijah I had a revelation he spoke it before he saw it oh I hope you caught that he spoke his revelation before he saw it he said I in the sole abundance of rain and the Bible says him in old and I'm gonna have his party but then he went to the Mountaineer brother and some Brown says he climbed the mountain to the top and they set with his head between his head and he said Ghazi come here go and look through these and see what you said he came and he came running back as his master I see nothing he says go back seven times man and the Bible says on the seventh time when he climbed

another mountain the first thing you know those kinds were thundering and the rain was falling what was it he accepted God and what God sent you see sometimes we want major things but this was a small

of God's deliverance he was told to shoot the arrow and the Bible said he shut it was it three times and the Prophet said if you had shot more you would have had more victories so we will not stop shooting until we have every victory we will not stop shootin until we see every young brother who has Baxley restored we will not stop shootin until we see every young sister restored because it's only a matter of time listen it's not us doing the restoration it's him doing the restoration it's not us doing the deliverance but you know what we have to do you may be seated but the day let's talk
