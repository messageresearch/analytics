[27:08] tonight may God bless you in a special
[27:11] way and you have a time in the Lord and
[27:16] in this season amen so reading from 2nd
[27:22] Peter 1 and reading from this one
[27:25] Simon Pizza a servant and an apostle of
[27:28] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[27:31] like precious faith so he's not speaking
[27:34] to any and everybody but he's speaking
[27:36] to them who have obtained like precious
[27:38] faith with us through the righteousness
[27:41] of God not not the own righteousness but
[27:44] the righteousness of God and our Savior
[27:46] Jesus Christ
[27:47] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[27:50] through the knowledge of God and of
[27:53] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[27:57] power have given unto us all things that
[28:01] the teen unto life and godliness his
[28:05] divine power hath give
[28:07] past tense all things that pertain unto
[28:10] life and godliness through the knowledge
[28:13] of him that had called us to glory and
[28:16] virtue whereby are given unto us so this
[28:19] is the definition of these all things
[28:21] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[28:24] great and precious promises that by visa
[28:27] might be partakers of the divine nature
[28:30] having escaped the corruption that is in
[28:33] the world through lust and besides this
[28:35] giving all diligence add to your faith
[28:37] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[28:40] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[28:42] patience and to patience godliness and
[28:45] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[28:48] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[28:50] things be in you and abound they make
[28:53] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[28:55] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[28:58] Jesus Christ my Lord and a blessing to
[29:01] the reading of his word
[29:02] you may be seated this evening in the
[29:05] precious name of the Lord and we are
[29:07] gonna have a grand time in the law this
[29:09] evening you believe that I know the
[29:11] weather report said that things should
[29:13] have been a little rainy today but God
[29:16] allowed us to make it here this evening
[29:18] and because he did that is because he
[29:20] wants us to be here this evening
[29:22] amen if you here this evening is because
[29:24] God wanted you to be here to be blessed
[29:27] and if you couldn't make it for some
[29:28] reason
[29:29] then we thank God that he allows us as
[29:31] when the Prophet was here and he put
[29:32] things on the recorder we have recording
[29:34] equipment as well so you could not only
[29:36] hear it afterwards but you could hear it
[29:38] while it's going on as well can a church
[29:40] say Amen
[29:40] so for a text tonight the manifestation
[29:44] of the nature of God in the bride the
[29:48] manifestation of the nature of God in
[29:51] the bride I'll see one more time the
[29:53] manifestation of the nature of God in
[29:57] the bride and it's a powerful thing
[30:00] because everything can be tied back to
[30:02] Genesis and when Adam existed alone god
[30:06] looked at Adam and said it's not good
[30:08] for man to be alone so he put Adam to a
[30:11] deep sleep and out of this deep sleep he
[30:14] pulled a woman he pulled a rib out and
[30:17] he pulled
[30:18] the female element out of this spirit
[30:20] man that was Adam that he put flesh on
[30:22] he pulled that out and when Adam woke
[30:24] from his sleep and he looked at her he
[30:26] said this is flesh of my flesh this is
[30:29] bone of my bone I know without a shadow
[30:32] of a doubt that you came from me he was
[30:35] looking at part of himself in that so he
[30:38] knew that that was connected to him and
[30:40] it has to come a point in our journey
[30:42] with God and as you become introduced to
[30:45] your husband there is a change that has
[30:47] to take place that he can begin to speak
[30:49] back to you and say this is flesh of my
[30:52] flesh this is bone of my bone this is
[30:55] spirit of my spirit the same words that
[30:58] I said that I'm gonna do I see you doing
[31:01] so you must be the one you must be born
[31:04] of my bone and flesh of my flesh and
[31:07] spirit of my spirit because when I look
[31:10] at you I'm seeing part of me when I look
[31:12] at me and I look at you I'm seeing me
[31:14] and I'm seeing you and I that day you
[31:16] wanna know that I'm in the Father hear
[31:17] me and I am you it's gonna be hard to
[31:20] differentiate between Christ and his
[31:22] bride because the two become one when
[31:24] they see me they see the father when
[31:26] they see you to see your husband and the
[31:28] church hmmm so there has to come
[31:30] something that will bring about a
[31:32] manifestation of the nature of God in
[31:36] his bride right now our nature is our
[31:39] own nature our behavior is our own
[31:43] behavior our attitudes our own attitudes
[31:46] we can tell you apart from the person
[31:49] next to you because of your nature
[31:51] we know who like booth this way and who
[31:54] like to do things that way even if you
[31:57] don't see somebody the way they walk
[31:59] speaks to their nature can the church
[32:03] say man your body language if it's dark
[32:06] and the light is off just the way you
[32:07] slow to certain way that identifies who
[32:10] you are there has to be something that
[32:13] comes upon us something that comes in us
[32:16] that it will take note that you've been
[32:19] with Jesus there's got to be something
[32:21] that come over you that your neighbor
[32:24] has to say I know
[32:25] this fella but this nature that I'm
[32:28] seeing I don't know this one
[32:29] he looks like how he used to look but
[32:31] the nature his nature is different this
[32:35] attitude is different his behavior is
[32:38] different the words he is using
[32:41] different than the church semen Oh
[32:45] hallelujah the manifestation of the
[32:49] nature of God in the bride because the
[32:53] scripture II read said why whereby we

[33:07] promises that are going to be fulfilled

[33:12] it's not just promises but it's great
[33:15] promises all of it you may not

[33:19] trying to make it clear to you that it's
[33:21] exceeding great and precious promises

[33:27] partakers of the divine nature of God so
[33:31] when you hear promise of restoration of
[33:33] your gray hair to black that's one of
[33:36] those exceeding great promises when you
[33:39] hear about the restoration but the
[33:41] terrors of your eyes that's an exceeding
[33:43] great promise that's not the ordinary
[33:45] promise
[33:46] normal promise it up it have different
[33:48] levels of promises we talk about the
[33:51] exceeding promises like change our body

[34:06] old bones when they're gonna get changed
[34:09] hallelujah somebody say man

[34:16] families you may have given up on them
[34:18] in your heart but there's an exceeding
[34:20] great promise it's a precious promise
[34:22] don't let go of the promise
[34:25] don't drop the promise don't lose the
[34:27] promise God that promise protect that
[34:30] promise keep that promise
[34:32] it's an exceeding great promise it's a
[34:34] precious promise protected defendant in
[34:38] that promise is your family in that
[34:40] promise is your healing in that promise
[34:43] it's a seventh on the revival hallelujah
[34:49] your son's name is written in that
[34:52] promise hallelujah hallelujah you shall
[34:57] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[35:00] upon you the promise is unto you and to
[35:02] your children all of those promises are
[35:06] your promises it's to you and to your
[35:08] children it's exceeding great promises
[35:11] and these promises because yes because
[35:16] the promise is given to you the promise
[35:20] is not given to everybody you know but
[35:22] the kindly it's not to everybody whereby
[35:25] are given unto us these promises were
[35:28] just handed of randomly to everybody
[35:30] these promises will not come upon a tree
[35:33] but people go and pick the promise these
[35:36] promises landed with your name given
[35:39] unto us you couldn't take it
[35:41] listen you couldn't take the promise it
[35:43] had to be given unto you somebody gives
[35:46] you the promise somebody give you the
[35:49] promise I have news for you tonight I
[35:51] didn't give you the promise the preacher
[35:53] can't gives you the promise
[35:57] I wanna read it one more time
[36:04] PETA is anointed PETA is inspired I
[36:08] don't know if I have 78 pitches it's not
[36:11] all for tonight I promise you that but
[36:14] this is Pete one which is on the
[36:16] scripture Simon Peter a servant an
[36:20] apostle he has a dual description he has
[36:24] a dual ministry and he puts servitude
[36:26] before his position he is firstly a
[36:28] servant and after his seven ministry is
[36:31] fulfilled now he could be an apostle so
[36:34] he makes it very clear servant he's a
[36:36] servant of the people he's a servant of
[36:38] the Cross he's a servant of this cause
[36:40] he is there to serve because they're
[36:43] people that need serving but beyond the
[36:45] ministry of servitude by the currents
[36:47] he's also an apostle he didn't make
[36:49] himself an apostle he didn't put in an
[36:51] application to be an apostle he didn't
[36:53] request Apostleship it was given to him
[36:56] hallelujah and that's the difference
[36:59] between the fivefold ministry and
[37:01] everybody else I can tell you tonight
[37:03] not every preacher is in the fivefold
[37:05] ministry because God is giving to the
[37:08] church it's one of the gifts that he
[37:11] gives he himself he is handling this
[37:13] ministry God Himself is the giver a lot
[37:18] of people know their gifts but I don't
[37:19] know that Giver
[37:20] he's the one giving so Peter is speaking
[37:23] from a position of authority because he
[37:25] know what he received he knows what he
[37:27] believed he understands his commission
[37:30] he understands who appointed him he
[37:33] understands who place him and the church
[37:37] Damon Oh hallelujah to them they have
[37:42] obtained like precious faith with us
[37:47] through the righteousness of God and our
[37:50] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[37:53] multiplied unto you that's what we need
[37:55] to talk to one another not just god
[37:58] bless you
[37:58] grace and peace be multiplied little
[38:01] multiplied in your life
[38:03] let peace abound in your life let grace
[38:06] multiply in your life when you go to
[38:08] work tomorrow let peace multiply on your
[38:10] job when you go home as healing like
[38:13] grace and peace multiply amongst your
[38:15] family let them know that you come
[38:17] different because grace and he is
[38:20] pronouncing a blessing over you
[38:23] [Music]
[38:24] [Applause]
[38:26] not just Grace and peace unto you but
[38:31] it's through the knowledge of God and of
[38:34] Jesus our Lord
[38:35] people know Church but they're known oh
[38:38] Jesus people know the message but they
[38:40] don't know the one who wrote the message
[38:42] they hear the message but the message
[38:44] was to connect us to the messenger and
[38:47] the messenger was the one who cut it
[38:50] from the one who send the message in the
[38:51] first place can the church taemin
[38:55] according as his divine power so I want
[38:58] to make a point here this evening if you
[38:59] would indulge me that it's nothing you
[39:02] could have done to get this thing that
[39:03] I'm talking about tonight no one has
[39:06] achieved this no one has earned this
[39:09] nobody has attained this but according
[39:12] as his divine power hath given unto us
[39:14] all things that put in unto life and
[39:17] godliness in other words all things that
[39:20] deal with the natural and the spiritual
[39:24] life and godliness he has already given
[39:27] us that's true the knowledge of him that
[39:30] I'll call us to glory and to virtue
[39:33] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[39:35] great can I take my time this evening
[39:38] exceeding great and precious promises
[39:40] that by these same promises he might be
[39:44] partakers of the divine nature so every
[39:47] promise that you consume every promise
[39:49] that becomes evidence in your life every
[39:51] promise that comes manifested in your
[39:53] life means you are no party and you are
[39:56] now experiencing the divine nature but
[39:59] for most of us what we have experienced
[40:01] has been on the external we have seen
[40:03] God move in different ways but we are
[40:05] going beyond that because his nature is
[40:08] trying to press himself into us
[40:11] so there has to be a move from the
[40:12] external to the in what can the church
[40:19] say man that he might be partakers of
[40:23] the divine nature having escaped escaped
[40:27] the corruption that is in the world
[40:29] through lust and these are familiar
[40:31] scriptures to us and besides this so he
[40:33] say in addition to that giving all
[40:36] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[40:38] to virtue knowledge on to knowledge
[40:41] temperance and to temperance patience
[40:42] and to patience godliness and the
[40:44] colonists brotherly kindness and to
[40:46] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[40:48] things be in you not just be in you and
[40:50] abound follow me must be operating it
[40:56] must be evidence it must be living it
[40:57] must be breeding it must be moving they
[40:59] make you that he shall neither be barren
[41:01] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the
[41:04] Lord Jesus Christ can the church say
[41:09] Amen amen amen
[41:11] now everything has a nature when it's
[41:16] over the nature of something you are
[41:19] referring to the inherent character or
[41:23] basic constitution of a certain thing
[41:25] that's the nature of the thing when
[41:29] you're born in this world and I'm
[41:30] experienced in this journey with my
[41:33] daughter and I see she really has a
[41:34] personality
[41:35] she already you see in this personality
[41:38] she already has done it you're sure it
[41:40] has a way she wants to do things to my
[41:44] wife she has lips being stored up in
[41:49] deposit just you gotta know but that
[41:52] behavior that meet you is really
[41:58] something else and the thing about it is
[42:03] that that we come to identify ourselves
[42:06] by who we are some of us we are we are
[42:09] smiley people some of us consider
[42:11] ourselves extroverts some say we are my
[42:13] interval that's my nature don't put me
[42:16] further anybody laughter mind me just
[42:18] not how I am so when God tell them go
[42:24] out and
[42:24] when I'm preach the gospel I would not
[42:27] believe that all the disciples were were
[42:29] extroverts but there have to be a change
[42:32] I come upon them that they can see let
[42:35] me forget them the things that I passed
[42:36] and my own nature because now I have a
[42:39] commission
[42:40] well III are you ready for that
[42:42] particular come I don't want to testify
[42:43] to nobody you know because I no no no no
[42:46] it had to be something come over them
[42:48] that their nature was different
[42:52] your nature is your be easier it's what
[42:56] you are made of I'm gonna bend over God
[42:59] being identified by his characteristics
[43:02] so your behavior tells what you are your
[43:05] nature tells what you are the pastor
[43:08] says it all the time you are who you are
[43:10] when you are by yourself we all know it
[43:13] you are who you are when you alone
[43:15] that's your nature you know when you go
[43:19] all by somebody and it finished and I
[43:21] get a copy do you rush you rush to wash
[43:23] your Coppola it's looking good you want
[43:25] to get points you know I watch more
[43:26] couple home what's wrought what cup a
[43:33] whole different cool everything whenever
[43:39] I said that's really who you are you
[43:42] take your real form you take your real
[43:45] sheep take your real you know when you
[43:50] take Ollie Ollie ollie I always say to
[43:52] analysis is a lot of good actors if the
[43:55] Awards the Academy Oscars or whatever
[43:57] the world ever acted was I handled a
[43:59] really did you really come here this
[44:00] that's enough here because people could
[44:04] be here themselves on you could you
[44:06] could you could act us into it only for
[44:08] so long but they say after time after
[44:11] time didn't I don't know you can't
[44:15] perform listen listen it became
[44:17] difficult for Judas after Ellen after is
[44:23] a because something was in him that and
[44:27] he had a destiny if he couldn't get away
[44:29] from and that's why we say there are
[44:33] people who convert children and they and
[44:35] they they backslide and the court
[44:36] decided to believe any
[44:37] more they were never completed their
[44:41] nature was never changed so they behave
[44:43] a certain way and they could do it
[44:45] something for years but after a while
[44:47] but the currents the acting of this get
[44:49] tired and situations will come to reveal
[44:54] what your true nature is the issue is
[45:00] that the revealing of your nature the
[45:01] issue is when the nature is uncovered to
[45:04] see funny what's there it is it Christ
[45:08] because you can see anything you can you
[45:10] can put on any show but in this season
[45:13] we are living in it's the unveiling of
[45:14] who you really are because who you
[45:16] really are is what is eligible or not
[45:19] eligible to make the rapture and the
[45:22] church seaman hallelujah the books are
[45:26] the books the tapes
[45:28] other teams the Bible is the Bible but
[45:30] until your nature becomes this Bible you
[45:33] have no rapture to go to come on now
[45:35] somebody preached back to me because God
[45:37] has a nature his world has a nature
[45:40] hallelujah that's why brother Branham
[45:43] said whenever you come to the house of
[45:44] God you either get better or you get
[45:46] worse
[45:46] because the word the nature of the word
[45:49] is to always bring change the world has
[45:53] a nature
[45:55] Jesus has a nature and the church a man
[46:01] birds have a nature you never see nobody
[46:04] here bird sing sad see but I'm running
[46:09] up with a buddypress boy only if I would
[46:12] shake your hand but but outside of the
[46:14] nature for Buddhism being untruthful
[46:16] nobody but for this morning I feel like
[46:18] singing the moment they wake up anymore
[46:20] then nature it's an unknown sense of new
[46:22] day something has a beer all with the
[46:26] chicken if the chicken wake up and I
[46:27] start to make noise anymore nning the
[46:30] needs of a chicken is normally sunlight
[46:32] breaks he's not a half church he's not
[46:35] to make noise because it's his nature
[46:37] and a real Christian has a nature a real
[46:40] Christian
[46:42] the worship they wake up in the morning
[46:45] that nature begets a live itself out
[46:48] come on now somebody preach back to me
[46:52] and this this nature is a growth because
[46:57] we heard it last Sunday member the owner
[46:59] was preaching but about making yourself
[47:02] a Christian so it means that this new
[47:04] pope is placing his nature in the small
[47:08] form that has to grow up into maturity
[47:13] and the church amen
[47:15] so now the tutor is now watching how you
[47:18] grow it to see how the nature will
[47:20] evolve if you're gonna add in fill in a
[47:24] diode if you wanna change your nature if
[47:27] money comes at you if you wanna change
[47:30] your nature if somebody talk bad about
[47:33] you if your niche you're gonna gonna now
[47:36] conform to respond to what they see
[47:38] because it's a test of nature it's a
[47:40] test of your behavior it's a test of
[47:43] your character it's a test of your
[47:44] attitude can the church even so your
[47:51] haircut reflects your nature the clothes
[47:54] you wear reflects your nature I don't
[47:56] need to wonder what you believe because
[47:58] it was sure after a while your nature
[48:01] will reveal itself
[48:03] kanna-chan say man I heard a story like
[48:08] you know in this in Chapter fact-check
[48:10] everything gothic news anything but I
[48:13] heard of story so I do some research and
[48:16] it seems to be you know so lady got a
[48:22] snake didn't type of snake and I really
[48:27] don't understand anything him behind it
[48:28] but she said it was a petty so she
[48:34] decided by a punch to keep this pet
[48:36] snake in her room nothing I can't do
[48:39] anything in your room eventually the pet
[48:40] snake not the light or any bed with her
[48:43] she was feeding the snake feeding me
[48:46] snake and then after a while he sneaked
[48:49] stop eating
[48:50] so do you want no food day - no food no
[48:56] food so she decided to go by the vet you
[48:59] see I have this she says I have this
[49:02] kind of snake and it was good all the
[49:04] time it's growing I was feeding it it
[49:06] was lying on a normal night anything the
[49:09] doctors had asked some questions how
[49:11] much there is at night in she about
[49:13] three forties does it lie down makes you
[49:15] say yes does it lie don't say it makes
[49:17] you well let me tell you what going on
[49:19] that snake is preparing its measuring
[49:23] you it's making sure that there's room
[49:26] so when you're ready to eat you it will
[49:29] do what it does so he does it that's
[49:33] you're wrong pet that's not a pet
[49:36] because the nature of that snake is to
[49:40] not eat for a while to make sure it has
[49:42] room so it was fortunate that you went
[49:45] in time before it finished reached the
[49:47] process of the measurement and I
[49:49] wondered or other thing I could do it
[49:51] but it was only a matter of time before
[49:54] they need you would have been revealed
[49:55] and it would have been maybe a different
[49:57] story but if one I want to make his
[49:59] animals have a nature the nature for
[50:06] trees to do a certain thing and every
[50:08] time something goes outside of its
[50:10] nature it's considered abnormal and this
[50:17] is why young people if you are
[50:18] predestinated your nature is already
[50:22] connected to a certain thing you know
[50:24] and every time you have a fiddle in the
[50:28] world you know become abnormal and I
[50:32] preach many many on people this living
[50:34] in Churchill have any wool is the most
[50:35] horrible expert you'll ever have it like
[50:38] because your outfit you could never fit
[50:40] in the world you try to fit so you try
[50:42] this I see it's like that down jacquard
[50:44] dance he tried to sing you can sing
[50:45] these you can fit in and because you
[50:51] have certain trappings of the world when
[50:53] they tried to come in church your car
[50:54] worship because it didn't gone them and
[50:55] you're living there nice balance because
[50:58] you're fighting against the nature
[51:01] can the church say Amen hallelujah
[51:04] hallelujah the nature of a situation in
[51:09] nature of things God has a meteor it's
[51:12] not on nature like the way we have
[51:14] nature
[51:14] because if God's nature was like our
[51:17] nature we in real trouble the way we
[51:21] behave God behave the way we behave
[51:22] forget it we have to thank God at his
[51:24] nature's divine we have to tango because
[51:28] we struggling to forgive for little
[51:30] small things and what Gore could hold
[51:32] against us is a good thing his ditches
[51:34] divine because it is divine for him to
[51:36] forgive and he's trying to get us to tap
[51:39] into that divine nature so we could
[51:40] forgive like he forgive because if we
[51:42] don't forgive then his nature doesn't
[51:44] even allow him to forgive because his
[51:46] natives are tuned to see him forgiveness
[51:48] displayed she said how could you be
[51:50] forgiven if you didn't want to release
[51:51] somebody you have to get His divine
[51:53] nature for His divine nature to be
[51:56] clearly reveal in your life come to
[51:58] church amen hallelujah the divine nature
[52:05] of God it's so wonderful that it could
[52:08] overlook your faults the divine nature
[52:11] of God to overlook your mistakes so you
[52:13] will find that when you begin to live
[52:16] His divine nature you begin to overlook
[52:18] certain things things don't bother you
[52:21] the way they used to bother you because
[52:22] God doesn't get bothered by every
[52:24] mistake you may that's why he put blood
[52:26] there His divine nature put a blood
[52:29] pumper that he don't even want to see
[52:31] your mistakes every day when the Prophet
[52:34] had the experience and he was condemning
[52:36] the woman and God open his eyes destroy
[52:38] him when the blood pumper was doing he
[52:40] saw every mistake functional God wasn't
[52:43] even seeing it
[52:44] that's a niche of God hallelujah the
[52:48] nature of quarters and see the
[52:49] possibility the nature of God is to see
[52:52] the possibility like some sort of
[52:54] possibility that's the divine nature of
[52:56] God no matter how things get no matter
[52:59] how low things get the divine nature of
[53:00] God brought him in front of Lazarus and
[53:03] when everybody else was crying the
[53:05] divine nature said Lazarus come forth
[53:08] that's a divine niche and I'm talking
[53:10] about the divine nature could go to that
[53:12] woman who they're about to stone and
[53:14] sing he without sin cast the first stone
[53:17] he was playing an advanced chess game
[53:20] with them because he is divine nature
[53:23] made a way for her and didn't make them
[53:25] people even feel but I see who have seen
[53:27] Cassie first stone and one might wanna
[53:28] make excuse the divine nature of God I'm
[53:34] by these precious promises all these
[53:37] promises we hear preach service after
[53:39] service it is to make us partakers of
[53:43] his divine nature the patek means to
[53:47] share to take part to experience
[53:49] something to longer to have a portion to
[53:52] have a have a portion of this thing
[53:54] partakers of the divine nature to get a
[53:57] share of this attribute that's why see
[54:00] because I live you can live also he is
[54:02] speaking about sharing his divine nature

[54:53] him - makes you - makes me - your nature
[54:59] is your life it's what your behavior is
[55:01] that's what we're we said what we need
[55:03] in jeffersonville is thousands of lives
[55:05] that's the fun that'll change the devil
[55:09] oh the devil knows that nature the devil
[55:12] knows that behavior can the church say
[55:15] man so when you hear surveillance you
[55:17] can be grumpy you can be frustrated
[55:19] because that is not his nature he's not
[55:22] frustrated is you no worries us in his
[55:27] name is don't worry he's not worried
[55:31] that's why when imagine he bring Moses
[55:33] out many people out he do miracles and
[55:36] Moses after all of us at the cry when he
[55:39] see fira behind
[55:41] they say mounted on both sides and we
[55:43] say after all I do that is the best
[55:46] lesson you can do go ahead to rebuke him
[55:49] why cry I've already shared my nature
[55:52] with you it's because you partook of my
[55:56] nature you were able to do what you did
[55:58] you already have enough of my nature to
[56:01] take action any situation you speak you
[56:05] speak and move forward you speak and
[56:08] move forward because every service every
[56:10] book every tip every file every
[56:12] experience is you taking a part of his
[56:15] nature
[56:15] until one day you'll need to UM be no
[56:18] more and his nature alone will be
[56:20] visible and untapped eh it'll be a
[56:23] manifestation of the nature of God in
[56:26] his pride
[56:29] hallelujah you may be seated
[56:32] Jesus could have could have said you
[56:34] know what I'm gonna come and finish this
[56:36] battle but he had so much confidence
[56:38] that this bride will adopt his nature
[56:42] then he feels confident to say this
[56:44] bride will have the final knockout punch
[56:46] she will be a super church she will be a
[56:50] super race that strength is not how old
[56:53] strength but she will have the very
[56:54] nature of God and the church say man no
[56:57] one you can see right now you lay hands
[57:00] on the sick but when that time comes
[57:02] when my nature is in you when the world
[57:05] looks at you want to see me in you you
[57:08] don't have to lay hands on the sick
[57:09] anymore you speak to the devils and the
[57:11] devils have to go because it's the same
[57:14] nature then the church say man who do
[57:17] you see this's the divine nature of God
[57:22] hallelujah hallelujah and every
[57:25] scripture you read every year of the
[57:27] Bible David Moses Joshua Elisha every
[57:31] single prophet have been in contact with
[57:33] the nature of God because once you come
[57:37] in contact with God your behavior
[57:38] changes it's impossible for you to meet
[57:42] God any behavior remain the same
[57:43] impossible it's impossible but the price
[57:46] is impossible so everybody benefits too
[57:53] much about a burning bush experience all
[57:56] Moses intellect everything he had a burr
[57:58] when he came into contact with a pillar
[58:00] of fire the man who walked down the
[58:02] mountain was a very different man who
[58:04] went up to mountain and what it is he
[58:06] will have your own mountain experience
[58:08] with your pillar of higher experience
[58:11] it'll be between you and God this has
[58:14] nothing to with anybody else this is not
[58:16] you and the church it's not you and the
[58:18] pasta this is you and God because God is
[58:21] longing for that individual relationship
[58:24] he wants to perform the surgery he don't
[58:27] want no other doctor operate in your
[58:28] heart you don't want no man inside your
[58:30] heart he wants to take full control of
[58:33] your heart of your life of your mind of
[58:36] body and the church semen Oh hallelujah
[58:42] but the Branham was a partaker of his
[58:45] divine nature to have the privilege to
[58:50] see into the mind of God see things like
[58:53] God because the way God sees is not the
[58:56] way we see so as per the panama's caught
[58:58] up in the nature of God he will see
[59:01] things differently and we heard it a
[59:04] believer of I read it on Sunday that in
[59:06] so much that the nature of God and the
[59:08] Prophet because it wasn't him doing it
[59:11] made it so that you could not tell the
[59:13] difference between his enemies and his
[59:15] friends that wasn't that occu will know
[59:18] somebody genuine I know you will know
[59:20] you will know because acting like I tell
[59:25] you woody for so long you let's drop out
[59:27] the car tear somebody's forget what rule
[59:29] in some ways forget your script mean
[59:33] professional just forget the script and
[59:35] as happy bloopers know how they make a
[59:36] mistake because they they drop out a
[59:38] character and some of us we has acted
[59:41] with act different for a wife or a
[59:43] husband everybody woke up they were
[59:45] Freddy Deacon different for our friends
[59:46] so much rose and somebody gets confused
[59:48] who we are today who am i today identity
[59:54] crisis and that's a challenge today
[59:56] young people they don't know who they
[59:57] are they want to beat this one they want
[59:59] to be that one they want to be the other
[1:00:00] one living on the and influence and
[1:00:04] influence because with the man improving
[1:00:07] there's two influences above or below
[1:00:08] all these characters all these different
[1:00:11] is what you want to reiterate havin it
[1:00:14] have unlimited counterfeit that's why
[1:00:17] I'm banking the car teach you how much
[1:00:19] counterfeit look at this wrong if you
[1:00:21] look at this trumpet you will never
[1:00:22] finish so the focus is nobody real delay
[1:00:25] is you see this study this study this
[1:00:27] well because if you know what this is
[1:00:29] you will recognize every counterfeit
[1:00:31] because somebody will go and try
[1:00:33] something new but if you stick to what
[1:00:34] this real thing is so there's one
[1:00:36] genuine real Holy Ghost there's one
[1:00:38] genuine baptism there's one genuine
[1:00:41] revival there's one genuine Church
[1:00:43] there's one genuine
[1:00:45] well there's one right but the brother
[1:00:47] said every touches such as certain rides
[1:00:49] right
[1:00:49] but the must come one that's got
[1:00:51] mechanics and dynamics and the church
[1:00:54] seamen the power of God moving in huh Oh
[1:00:59] hallelujah I'm not talking about this
[1:01:02] church now I'm talking about the church
[1:01:04] triumphant there's one church as one
[1:01:07] bride as one people yes one body and
[1:01:09] that body will not be manhandled that
[1:01:12] body cannot be fenced one squad drops
[1:01:15] his nature in these sons and daughters
[1:01:18] and they catch a revelation of who they
[1:01:20] are and whose they are no man could hold
[1:01:23] them no church could hold them no group
[1:01:26] could hold them because they are Upward
[1:01:28] Bound they are not bound by walls up
[1:01:31] what bound up yeah going vertical and
[1:01:34] the church hey man do you want to go for
[1:01:37] tikka do you want to go up do you want
[1:01:39] to leave this place the divine nature of
[1:01:52] God God is a spirit so when you talk
[1:01:56] about the divine nature we're talking
[1:01:57] about the spirit around we're talking
[1:01:58] about this this a prophet call
[1:02:00] it Widow but it's flesh man that always
[1:02:02] giving trouble boot over the spirit man
[1:02:05] who you really are and the church see
[1:02:09] men do you that we don't see all the
[1:02:12] time but do you that's real you that's
[1:02:14] awesome
[1:02:15] enter new party at your ffunny that's
[1:02:19] the man we preach into tonight because
[1:02:22] that man has to bring this flesh man
[1:02:24] under subjection that man have to bring
[1:02:26] these talks on the subjection I love
[1:02:29] what better oh love reached the tipping
[1:02:31] between your thinking on your thoughts
[1:02:32] or kind of thoughts in your mind a devil

[1:02:36] your thinking I'm thinking about the
[1:02:38] revival oh the lever put toss you copy

[1:02:52] these bones are gonna get a new body one
[1:02:54] of these pieces more to put them that's
[1:02:56] what I'm thinking about I'm thinking

[1:03:02] loved ones I'm thinking about talking to
[1:03:04] David I'm thinking about talking
[1:03:05] obsessed I can the church say Amen to
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:13] define nature of God all your thoughts
[1:03:18] all of our thoughts God sees resources
[1:03:22] on every thought that flashed your mind
[1:03:25] God has accessed it if he don't think
[1:03:28] his own thinking and he dwell on your
[1:03:30] thoughts mean trouble because he's
[1:03:35] exposed to all our thoughts he's exposed
[1:03:37] to all of our desires
[1:03:38] he's exposed to when you're weak and
[1:03:40] when you're strong but he's not dwelling
[1:03:42] on your thoughts his thinking is about
[1:03:44] where you're going he's thinking about
[1:03:46] it's about why you wrote your name in
[1:03:48] blood and even when you fall he's
[1:03:50] thinking cause but how he sees you
[1:03:53] making it over on the other side and he
[1:03:56] has confidence as they come on get back
[1:03:58] up you're gonna have a Reviver get back
[1:04:00] up you're gonna get the Holy Ghost get
[1:04:02] back up that's not who you are
[1:04:03] that's not your nature that's a spirit
[1:04:06] upon you but once that spirit comes off
[1:04:08] of you the real you the real nature the
[1:04:10] real speed and the soul because that's
[1:04:13] who you are your name in the book of the
[1:04:18] literal name but the mystery of who you
[1:04:21] are hallelujah
[1:04:24] your nature is a mystery Jesus Christ
[1:04:27] nature is a mystery how you could
[1:04:30] explain God it's a mystery you can't
[1:04:32] even try to explain it for her centuries
[1:04:35] and centuries in no code and this way to
[1:04:37] know God and this woman no god I said
[1:04:39] but when Jesus came that was Christ was
[1:04:42] trying to reveal the mystery of God for
[1:04:44] the first time that they had gotten up
[1:04:46] America touch and talk to and 99% didn't
[1:04:49] even realize that the god of the Old
[1:04:53] Testament was walking amongst them the
[1:04:55] revelation of this God is revealing of
[1:04:58] this very
[1:04:59] of God who they wanted to understand
[1:05:01] they could not come into contact with it
[1:05:03] even when he was there
[1:05:05] oh come on now somebody please back to
[1:05:07] me but it Terence everyone in that day
[1:05:14] knew the stories about how God visited
[1:05:17] Abraham and how God came to Isaac and oh
[1:05:20] Gordon tells me Jacob and Israel and he
[1:05:22] knew it
[1:05:23] am i tempt Jesus him all of the
[1:05:26] behaviors that he will count him as God
[1:05:28] have wrapped themselves up in Jesus the
[1:05:32] very nature of God was in front of them
[1:05:34] and they could not equate the equation
[1:05:41] they mr. humility the mist the
[1:05:47] simplicity confuse them the way he moved
[1:05:54] even Judas had to come and kiss him on
[1:05:57] his cheek because I couldn't tell this
[1:06:00] great mystery that was there you
[1:06:03] couldn't tell that it was deity you
[1:06:06] couldn't tell deity from pizza can the
[1:06:10] church say Amen God veil themselves in
[1:06:14] simplicity and took a handful of people
[1:06:19] like Peter who had his ups and downs I
[1:06:22] love Peter I've talked by its harbor
[1:06:24] Eclipse to have favorite Bible
[1:06:26] characters it's really difficult but if
[1:06:28] I have to if I take one in the Old
[1:06:30] Testament I want to use New Testament
[1:06:31] but a Jason if you ax were Isaac's
[1:06:35] favorites is hard to get I like David
[1:06:38] Wright Peter because these brothers kept
[1:06:42] it real not that there wasn't others who
[1:06:46] didn't keep it real but it's just that
[1:06:47] we have so much information about it the
[1:06:49] event was quick Lord how they increase
[1:06:51] that trouble me go ahead trouble and
[1:06:52] trouble
[1:06:54] he wasn't like heaven on over to tell
[1:06:57] nobody
[1:06:57] anyway when they will feel like tear a
[1:07:02] seal or restore to me the joy I lost but
[1:07:05] joy of my salvation
[1:07:07] yeah people coming to church the joy
[1:07:10] because they don't know where they found
[1:07:11] it where they left it when but didn't
[1:07:14] even cry Laden lorry stole my joy leave
[1:07:16] it didn't lose his salvation you know
[1:07:17] but there was a step you see by the
[1:07:21] antennas commander church with a step
[1:07:26] you know just walk in the church he
[1:07:29] there's an excitement he woman he hid
[1:07:30] that he's at the chip where as I saw
[1:07:32] someone fast on he tripping because I
[1:07:35] step
[1:07:35] he lives on I was glad when they 17 let
[1:07:39] us go into the house of the Lord
[1:07:40] you don't have to wonder what I scoop
[1:07:42] tell me when you look up at an time
[1:07:43] because he's a living reflection of that
[1:07:45] scripture and the reality is when you
[1:07:54] read about the heroes of faith in
[1:07:56] Hebrews 11 listen these all obtained a
[1:07:58] good report and they didn't even see the
[1:08:01] promise but their report cards just
[1:08:03] having you the report cut out of here
[1:08:07] they got the a performance impact and
[1:08:12] behavior DF it blotted out their
[1:08:15] mistakes dfv blotted out their
[1:08:19] transgressions and in the Bible a of
[1:08:23] able to be redeemed by fate not
[1:08:26] obtaining the promise what promise this
[1:08:30] promise of the Holy Ghost so let me ask
[1:08:32] you this question if without the Holy
[1:08:35] Ghost they could have a good report what
[1:08:40] I know we are going right what is your
[1:08:42] excuse
[1:08:44] because they didn't have access to the
[1:08:47] promise but now we have good report plus
[1:08:50] the promise we have access to manifest
[1:08:52] board but kindly good report and the
[1:08:56] promise
[1:09:00] deal live with what they had is the
[1:09:03] common and had a good report by feet by
[1:09:07] feet then sheepskin who hunted
[1:09:10] persecuted and with the situation they
[1:09:12] had and as I say life is about
[1:09:16] within the limitation of different
[1:09:18] resources that's life
[1:09:21] that's what life isn't all the old
[1:09:24] people didn't know the simple listen all
[1:09:25] I have like the woman that Eli Joanne -
[1:09:29] I didn't have oil and flour our normal
[1:09:33] resources that working with this is how
[1:09:35] much time I have to live with and if you
[1:09:37] ever say well bake me a cake with she
[1:09:40] was working with her resources and when
[1:09:43] she picked a kitchen and later this man
[1:09:46] who eats it as a different kind of man
[1:09:47] and the Bible says her resources didn't
[1:09:49] run out but she was prepared to work
[1:09:52] with her resources and in that didn't
[1:09:56] have access to the Holy Ghost because
[1:09:57] the Holy Ghost was only important after
[1:09:58] Jesus came so they had a report without
[1:10:02] the Holy Ghost that was so powerful that
[1:10:04] they made it into Hebrews 11 and many of
[1:10:09] us yes we are looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:10:11] but the reality is our behavior could
[1:10:13] have more feet because it makes fear to
[1:10:17] activate the promise many of us see we
[1:10:20] wait and we wait in religion and develop
[1:10:22] and said God is written because me it
[1:10:24] makes you go into action we put you into
[1:10:27] prayer feet lets you start a revival
[1:10:29] because faith without works is dead so
[1:10:31] you have to have enough fear to go into
[1:10:33] action and say I'm doing this and that's
[1:10:36] God's nature that is nature being
[1:10:39] Express come the church say man can you
[1:10:42] take some more hallelujah
[1:10:46] so we are gonna change of the spirit man
[1:10:48] of the divine nature that change your
[1:10:51] nature out new heart new spirit in
[1:10:54] spirit that's the same thing we talking
[1:10:56] about new heart new spirit when his
[1:10:59] spirit steps in there
[1:11:00] that is not your nature anymore that's
[1:11:03] his nature and then you can't explain
[1:11:06] why you're forgiving people
[1:11:07] you're not about not making sense
[1:11:10] because it's not your nature you can't
[1:11:13] explain why your love you can explain
[1:11:15] why I forgive you can't explain why your
[1:11:16] worship because it no longer your nature
[1:11:18] it's his nature can the church say
[1:11:21] amen hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:11:25] the Lord we're gonna skipper a few
[1:11:28] things when the message oneness that's
[1:11:31] got purpose
[1:11:32] that's God's purpose and his purpose as
[1:11:35] far the supreme wants to be one with his
[1:11:37] family directly family Adam and Eve and
[1:11:39] the only way that they could be one with
[1:11:41] the family over God was because God's
[1:11:43] nature was in them so Adam and Eve had
[1:11:46] God's nature in them that made them with
[1:11:50] God's nation and then with each other
[1:11:51] and God he became all one it's not a
[1:11:53] beautiful picture God in his family
[1:11:55] father over all supreme and it was
[1:11:58] because his nature was in them his
[1:12:00] nature no death no sorrow no heartaches
[1:12:03] no nothing just joy unspeakable never to
[1:12:07] be sick never to have a heartache
[1:12:08] because Gorka get sick because his
[1:12:11] nature is unsinkable you know that that
[1:12:12] that's a word right his nature kind of
[1:12:15] get sick go car get sick can the church
[1:12:18] say man so where is nature begins to
[1:12:20] become more and more you suddenly
[1:12:22] sickness have to come by your street and
[1:12:23] not come nigh v-not this house not this
[1:12:26] house this nature
[1:12:28] I'm can the church amen hallelujah
[1:12:33] hallelujah no death no sorrow no
[1:12:36] heartaches no nothing just joy
[1:12:38] unspeakable because that's his nature
[1:12:40] never to be sick never time I pick just
[1:12:44] one with God
[1:12:45] what a picture because the very nature
[1:12:47] of God was in these people God I want to
[1:12:50] see that to see the very nature of God
[1:12:53] in these people and we will see it we
[1:12:57] will see it walking the earth again will
[1:12:59] see it walking escheats once again will
[1:13:01] see it walk in the hospitals wander
[1:13:03] again we've seen walk in the streets of
[1:13:05] this country once again the very nature
[1:13:07] of God oh no temuco stoppage no demon
[1:13:12] can stop it why because the seed would
[1:13:14] in you is the very nature of God in Word
[1:13:17] form and one of these here's a spirit
[1:13:19] the rain the dynamics the Lateran will
[1:13:22] water that sheep bring it to life
[1:13:24] this service you gettin strung up every
[1:13:26] service you come with a realization of
[1:13:28] who you are every day something is
[1:13:30] growing in you
[1:13:32] one day Mary didn't know she was there
[1:13:34] but she was chosen to bring forth Christ
[1:13:36] can the church see man hallelujah
[1:13:41] blessed be the name of the local you
[1:13:43] take some more hallelujah in the
[1:13:46] identified Christ of all inches I'm
[1:13:48] feeling religious this evening I'm
[1:13:50] feeling excited because God chose me
[1:13:52] little ol me to put his nature God chose
[1:13:55] you to put his nature to confuse the
[1:13:58] devil to tie up the devil could put some
[1:14:01] cap shoes if you will and drop them
[1:14:04] around the world that would be
[1:14:05] compatible with his nature and God's
[1:14:08] love the seed in these capsules call us
[1:14:10] all and say let the devil as
[1:14:13] everybody the devil has churches the
[1:14:15] devil has ministers the devil has all
[1:14:17] kind of people but God has his horn
[1:14:19] people with the seed word in them that
[1:14:22] he sent a prophet to ensure that the
[1:14:25] ingredients the activated sheath would
[1:14:28] be presented to them the fertilizer the
[1:14:31] word the word that was scattered
[1:14:33] throughout all ages now reveals now
[1:14:37] connected now working together for the
[1:14:41] manifestation of the very nature of God
[1:14:47] in the identified Christ of all ages you
[1:14:50] see all these things just watch it
[1:14:52] Christ he was a part of it God doesn't
[1:14:54] change his nature doesn't change his
[1:14:56] nature doesn't change his nature doesn't
[1:15:02] change unchanging nature that's what the
[1:15:05] Prophet said if he healed in time for us
[1:15:07] he's got to do it again because he
[1:15:10] cannot improve on perfection he is
[1:15:13] perfect perfection he can't figure out a
[1:15:16] better way to do it and when he chose
[1:15:18] you before the foundation of the world
[1:15:20] that decision was a perfect decision
[1:15:21] Eden there was no better decision he can
[1:15:25] make because he cannot change he cannot
[1:15:28] change his mind about you he kind of
[1:15:30] change his thinking about you he cannot
[1:15:32] change his thoughts about you that's
[1:15:34] nature he said I am called I change not
[1:15:37] and as a nature of God the divine nature
[1:15:42] grows in you you become solid like a
[1:15:45] rock
[1:15:45] the Bible said to him not overcome it
[1:15:47] because you have to overcome yourself
[1:15:48] overcome everything
[1:15:49] to him that overcometh when you
[1:15:51] overcoming you making a room for him to
[1:15:53] grow you see but if I see that I empty
[1:15:55] out mg/l mg/l so he can fill fill fill
[1:15:57] to him that overcometh will I make as a
[1:16:00] pillar in the church you can't even move
[1:16:04] you you can't even shake you your rooted
[1:16:07] and grounded the winds that come the
[1:16:09] storms could blow but his divine nature
[1:16:11] only shakes and unzip peace be still the
[1:16:15] storm doesn't move you when you can
[1:16:17] speak to the strong come on now can the
[1:16:20] church say man this character doesn't
[1:16:25] change as the divine nature grows in you
[1:16:30] your doctrine Lochan you become more
[1:16:39] persuaded as Abraham grew and as time
[1:16:44] passed the back seat staggered not at
[1:16:46] the promise it became stronger it had to
[1:16:50] become stronger you know there's a law
[1:16:52] in economics diminishing returns that
[1:16:55] says as time progresses the effect of
[1:16:57] certain needs get weaker that's be so
[1:16:59] destructive it
[1:17:00] it happens in medicine as well they say
[1:17:02] after you take medicine puppies are okay
[1:17:04] after a period of time you take a
[1:17:05] stronger dose yeah because the effect of
[1:17:09] the medication starts away off so how
[1:17:12] much faith Abraham had when his body is
[1:17:16] getting weaker and Sirica than all it
[1:17:19] means that his feet was increasing
[1:17:24] because you need more feet than 113 at
[1:17:27] 75 come on now somebody preach back to
[1:17:30] me if God call you my parents all that
[1:17:34] years ago and you're still standing it
[1:17:36] means your feet had to be more than it
[1:17:38] was years ago
[1:17:39] come on now somebody reach back to me
[1:17:41] don't let the devil tell you you're
[1:17:43] weaker than you were years ago like the
[1:17:45] devil tell me you're tired I can't

[1:18:03] we take him is a higher dose anybody see
[1:18:07] him those for the gorge all now the it
[1:18:09] way off but it could have to be
[1:18:11] increasingly those increasingly doors
[1:18:12] because you're still coming you're still
[1:18:14] coming you should've given up a long
[1:18:15] time ago but you still coming something
[1:18:17] is growing his divine nature is
[1:18:20] increasing in you that when your body
[1:18:22] want to give up did you still keep
[1:18:24] coming hallelujah but the terrace is
[1:18:32] here tonight you think his body not God
[1:18:34] water a cup but he take a pill and it's

[1:18:39] buildable this gospel and it gives him
[1:18:42] joy unspeakable that in the face of his
[1:18:45] trials you can count it all joy that the
[1:18:49] sufferings of this present time I'm not
[1:18:51] even worthy to be compared with the

[1:19:27] against the rock and she called the
[1:19:29] skills and it's like a new eagle again

[1:23:36] nature of God in the pride hallelujah
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:45] hallelujah let me drop this for you the
[1:23:49] prodigal son left his home without a
[1:23:54] full realization of the sea that was in
[1:23:56] his heart he didn't even understand the
[1:24:00] law of a seat so he went as far as he
[1:24:05] thought he could go
[1:24:06] that's why Jesus didn't bring the
[1:24:08] parable just to have it to us to have a
[1:24:09] parable to talk about it's a parable
[1:24:12] with a message that this prodigal son
[1:24:15] thought that he was on his own he
[1:24:18] thought that he was in control he
[1:24:20] thought that he was doing what he wanted
[1:24:22] to do and God was teaching us that no
[1:24:25] matter where he ended up and he ended up
[1:24:27] going against his beliefs because the
[1:24:29] three pigs to eat pig food meant he went
[1:24:32] against his spiritual belief because
[1:24:35] Jews and pigs don't fix
[1:24:37] so he was back slidden as bad season
[1:24:40] could be and in his back sitting
[1:24:42] condition the Bible says he came to his
[1:24:45] senses he came to it said it came to
[1:24:48] himself he came to himself which means
[1:24:56] with this he was here and himself with
[1:24:58] someone else but when he and himself
[1:25:06] meant by George you real who he was not
[1:25:10] the money not what he was boasting about
[1:25:13] not to what he was bragging about but he
[1:25:15] really him save oh wait a minute in my
[1:25:18] father's house these servants have food
[1:25:21] they have hamburger for those who eat
[1:25:24] hamburger they have vegan patties for
[1:25:26] those who have vegan they have swap meet
[1:25:31] they have they have they have no carbon
[1:25:34] they have a high-carb they have all kind
[1:25:36] of food and he I am eating pig food he
[1:25:39] said I will arise I will go to my father
[1:25:42] I will tell my father I have sinned am I
[1:25:45] even worried if you call your son and he
[1:25:47] is talking not even knowing his words
[1:25:50] can make sense because once your son you
[1:25:52] always a son so you see in I'm not
[1:25:55] worried to be called a son don't change
[1:25:57] the fact that your blood is son blood
[1:26:00] come on now don't change in fact that
[1:26:03] your DNA is royalty yeah you could
[1:26:05] change your name you can change your
[1:26:07] heart your outfit but whenever they see
[1:26:09] you didn't know your prince so he coming
[1:26:11] back and he listen I'm a servant not a
[1:26:14] son I'm a servant but a son he
[1:26:16] practicing this speech on the way home
[1:26:18] I mean moment if father see him coming
[1:26:20] he didn't see my servant is coming home
[1:26:22] he said kill the fatted calf because my
[1:26:25] son he might be back sitting but that's
[1:26:29] my son he might be in a condition but
[1:26:32] that's my son you can call him what you
[1:26:34] want what does my son
[1:26:37] and that's nuts amen and listen you know
[1:26:44] I love about God you see here is now
[1:26:49] where was yesterday way to last week
[1:26:52] what happened last month I want to pull
[1:26:55] my eyeball commentry
[1:26:56] of where was since he said listen kill
[1:26:59] the calf get your own candy ring steady
[1:27:02] music can I be ready my son who was once
[1:27:04] lost he is now fun can the church say
[1:27:08] Amen
[1:27:09] that's the divine nature of God this is
[1:27:12] the gospel of redemption it's a gospel
[1:27:14] of restoration is a gospel of bringing
[1:27:16] people back come the church see man oh
[1:27:19] I'm trying to wrap up here woo but Terry
[1:27:24] I'm feeling strong you know you never
[1:27:26] lie to me listen to me your tired your
[1:27:28] time a call my wife anywhere say I need
[1:27:30] some coffee
[1:27:33] come here this evening that I feel like
[1:27:35] you go for three hours
[1:27:37] today I go for trio is this hallelujah
[1:27:41] in revelation of Jesus Christ but about
[1:27:44] say let me show you another reason why
[1:27:45] season he it's this book of revelation
[1:27:47] of Jesus Christ in the church he knows
[1:27:50] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:27:51] and today and forever
[1:27:54] this is powerful if you don't know the
[1:27:56] devil knows think about it the devil is
[1:28:00] sick today overall if we ever yeah be
[1:28:03] careful then people can just match us up
[1:28:05] the way they did it before he knows that
[1:28:08] she is a same yes native and he changes
[1:28:10] not he knows that and the Prophet senses
[1:28:12] a whole lot more than do 90% of the he
[1:28:18] knows that since God is immutable in his
[1:28:20] nature then he is just as immutable in
[1:28:23] his ways the city knows assuredly that
[1:28:26] the original church at Pentecost with
[1:28:29] the power of God mark succeed in action
[1:28:31] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:28:34] his own all else has Falls it has to be
[1:28:37] so as the divine nature of God because
[1:28:40] some manifest in his bride it will bring
[1:28:42] a true
[1:28:43] Church which is at sym mark 16 an action
[1:28:45] church where these signs follow them
[1:28:48] that believe in my name all of these
[1:28:52] things come to church amen
[1:28:54] but the Branham goes on him the future
[1:28:56] home of the heavenly bridegroom and
[1:28:57] debride I want to try to wrap up soon if
[1:29:00] he ever healed a person he has to do it
[1:29:02] again when the same conditions is met he
[1:29:05] ever ever saved the man he's got to do
[1:29:07] it on the same grounds he did it the
[1:29:09] first time if he ever failed a man with
[1:29:11] the Holy Ghost he's gotta to it and the
[1:29:13] same grounds he did the first time if he
[1:29:15] ever raised a man up from the grave he's
[1:29:17] gotta do it the second time and every
[1:29:19] other time on the same principles Oh
[1:29:23] hallelujah getting ready to wind down in
[1:29:27] modern events made clear by prophecy and
[1:29:30] so we finally a God does that in every
[1:29:32] age God does his own choosing by its own
[1:29:35] predestinated choosing he chooses
[1:29:37] profits and things for the ages fixes
[1:29:39] his nature
[1:29:40] the man's nature the man's style of
[1:29:43] preaching on the gift of knowledge this
[1:29:45] is meant to meet the challenge of that
[1:29:47] day God creates that man and sent him
[1:29:51] you see this thing this divine nature
[1:29:54] and how this hotel holding within each
[1:29:55] is connected God is orchestrating all of
[1:29:58] this because he's gonna have a super
[1:29:59] church and you want you to be in a
[1:30:01] position to speak to your family have an
[1:30:03] influence will be a children influence
[1:30:06] over your house influence over your life
[1:30:08] influence over those around you since
[1:30:10] the hacker I didn't even know that hot
[1:30:12] action and how was gonna have but when
[1:30:15] the Prophet was speaking about what took
[1:30:16] place and he said that's nothing but the
[1:30:18] truth all of a sudden he says whatever
[1:30:20] you need
[1:30:21] say it ask it say one the salvation of
[1:30:26] my two boys
[1:30:26] but bands if she wanted money to get
[1:30:28] money whatever she wanted and wherever
[1:30:32] those boys were salvation came just like
[1:30:36] Lazarus Lazarus didn't have a choice
[1:30:38] Lazarus come forth like the funny self
[1:30:41] on cam OTS
[1:30:42] all them these daily to figure it out
[1:30:44] and come out now see comedy jumping out
[1:30:47] jumping out dead man when that would
[1:30:51] speak when that voice weak dared if I go
[1:30:53] who if he had was that my separation
[1:30:56] ever happen happen I don't need an
[1:30:59] explanation
[1:31:00] I didn't know how it happened I just
[1:31:01] know where that voice speaks he said we
[1:31:04] don't need to know the mechanics I said
[1:31:05] I never went in for he speaks when I
[1:31:06] turn the car engine dick I have to start
[1:31:08] whatever needs to be connected needs to
[1:31:10] be connected but once the engine turn it
[1:31:13] need to start and when that voice speaks
[1:31:15] something must happen and there's coming
[1:31:16] a time where you speak because the
[1:31:18] Prophet said it when that time comes you
[1:31:20] say you speak what do you want we tell
[1:31:24] those seven thunders uttered I said that
[1:31:26] group could take Dolan and handed a
[1:31:27] slice and cut you open they have a
[1:31:29] they'll do what they want to do because
[1:31:32] his divine nature will be in them you
[1:31:34] love the Lord is evening can we give the
[1:31:36] Lord a hand the praise I'm finished
[1:31:38] Oh hallelujah hallelujah gives a lot of
[1:31:42] shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:46] hallelujah so as what Anthony gets ready
[1:31:50] by Thompson come so after this service
[1:31:53] there's more of his nature that's
[1:31:56] already in you every service you come as
[1:31:59] small every trial you face is more
[1:32:02] because it's preparing you to do more
[1:32:04] hallelujah and has nothing to with your
[1:32:06] feeling because even gettin all but
[1:32:09] everyday was getting closer to your son
[1:32:10] his age and his feeling had nothing to
[1:32:13] do with the fact that it was going to
[1:32:15] happen he couldn't look at his feeling
[1:32:17] can look at his emotion but I feel
[1:32:19] nothing and they have nothing to do with
[1:32:21] that
[1:32:22] hallelujah button of light is growing
[1:32:25] and because of that the devil now has
[1:32:27] you have more of a target and that's a
[1:32:29] good thing that's a great thing if
[1:32:30] you're not a target for the enemy
[1:32:31] you're not only run him up but if you're
[1:32:34] a target for the enemy to me that
[1:32:36] there's a light in you I never say who
[1:32:37] is that who what's going on their level
[1:32:40] can the church say man the divine nature
[1:32:44] beginning to reveal himself may the Lord
