Thank you for your mercy tonight, Father. Lord, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads for a word of prayer? Our gracious heavenly father, we come this evening, Lord, in your house, your house of praise, your house of worship. Father, so grateful for this opportunity to be gathered, for this opportunity to have church, to this opportunity to Lord, be able to come to hear a word from you and to be reminded of our eternal destination, our eternal history, our [music] eternal makeup, our eternal structure, the eternal thoughts that we are supposed to have that Lord elevates us above this natural realm, this realm [music] that is designed to Lord keep man, Lord Lord on this terrestrial plane. But Father, we are Lord commanded to come up hither, to climb higher, to rise above our situations, to rise above our conditions, to rise above the obstacles, to rise above depression, to rise above tiredness, to rise above the cares of this world. Uh rise above the sin that so easily beset us. Uh rise above the weights of this world to rise above the distractions of this world. Rise above what the enemy may throw our weight. Rise above what the enemy may try to do. Rise above how we feel. Rise above how we think. Rise above what the doctor might say it. Rise above what the neighbor might say it. Rise above what the government may say. It rise above what our bodies may say. Rise above the temptations. rise above the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life to rise above our carnal nature to rise above everything else, Lord, and to be caught into the realms of the heavenlies, Father. Lord, there's no place we'd rather be than in your presence. There's no atmosphere we'd rather be in than in your presence. So, Father, may you lift us up tonight and may you help us to see a fresh picture of Calvary. May you help us to see a fresh picture of your word. May you help us to catch a fresh vic a fresh picture Lord of how you want our families to operate, how you want the church to operate, how you want us to live. Uh we could be in this world but [music] not of this world. Father, may you give us a fresh picture today that we are creatures of eternity trapped in time. That we are just passing through and that we have a responsibility, Lord, to create an atmosphere. Live in that atmosphere, walk in that atmosphere, nurture that atmosphere. We have no time for foolishness. We have no time for depression. We have no time for frustration. We have no time for unbelief. We have no time for negativity. But Lord, we want to hear a word from you tonight, Lord. Because a word from you in due season, how pleasant it is, how wonderful it is, how fresh it is tonight, Father. May you bless everyone that's here in the service tonight. May you bless everyone that's gathered online that's connected. May the same presence we feel tonight, Lord, move [music] through the stream, Lord, into homes. Move through the stream and have an impact in jobs wherever they may be. Whoever is watching the service right now, may the pillar of fire, the presence of God, deity himself make himself known [music] to your people. We commit the service into your hands. May you take me out of the way and [music] speak lip to air to your people. We ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. So happy to be here in the house of the Lord tonight. Wednesday nights are always a special service. It takes a greater effort to be here and God blesses that. He rewards that. It's a separation because you have a choice. So, we appreciate uh those of you who have made a choice to be here physically in the church. And those of you who could have been here and are not, you have some work to do. And for those of you who really couldn't be here tonight and you are connected online, we encourage you to take the service as if you are in the service. So, don't be casual about it. Don't be light about it. This is God's business. And when we approach God's business, we want to approach it with the same level of sacredness and respect as if we are in the house of God. So shall we take our Bibles just one portion of scripture tonight reading from Hebrews uh chapter 3 and reading from verse 12. One portion of scripture there tonight. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief. Now, this is Paul's letter not to the Romans, but to the Hebrews, those who would have grown up in the faith, those would have a certain understanding of the faith. So, he's speaking to them and giving them a warning. He also addresses them as brethren. So, he's not speaking to casual onlookers. He's not speaking to people who are not of the faith. So take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called today. In other words, while there's an opportunity to do so, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. So Paul is understanding that everyone who comes into the faith has a beginning has a starting point. But the challenge in the journey is to hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. When people come into the faith they come with a steadfastness in the beginning of it. But during the journey it sometimes gets shaky and he's saying be confident and steadfast until the end. While it is said today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation. For some, when they had heard did provoke, how be it, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses? But with whom was he grieved 40 years? Was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated for our title tonight for this uh word from the Lord. I want to take a title tonight. Separating the true believers from the church members. Separating the true believers from the church members. And we know that the prophet taught us that in every church, not some churches, but in every church there are three kinds of believers. Are we together? In every church there are three kinds of believers. There are unbelievers. And that's a somewhat of a paradox to think that in the church they are unbelievers in the church. They are make believers in the church very good actors. So they do almost everything right that you would believe that they are believers because they are make believers. The unbelievers they are there in the church but they don't believe. They may not show it and express it and demonstrate it. But deep down the God who looks beyond the facial expression and beyond how they dress and beyond how they may respond to the word knows that there's unbelief in there. So there's unbelievers, there are make believers, and then there are the true believers. And there has to come a point where there's a separation of that one category of true believers from the rest that are just church members. So the unbeliever and the makebeliever, THEY ARE IN THE CHURCH. But God is not calling church members. He's not calling the unbelievers. He's not calling the makebelievers. He's looking for the individuals who are the true believers because God could only prove his word by true believers. So we are happy tonight to be identifying with true believers because true believers want all the word. True believers eat all the word. True believers are hungry for the word. When the true believer sees a buffet of the word, they want to take everything. They are not being selective and take this thing or that thing alone. They want to take all of it. So they're taking healing. They're taking correction. THEY'RE NOT JUST TAKING THE POSITIVE AND SAY, "I'M LOOKING TO BE BLESSED," BUT THEY want the word of correction to take the root of bitterness out of their heart, TO TAKE THE ENVY OUT OF THEIR HEART, TO TAKE THE JEALOUSY OUT OF THEIR HEART, TO FIX THE ISSUES IN THE HOME, TO RESTORE THE PRAYER ALTAR IN THE HOME, TO TO OPERATE A CERTAIN WAY IN THE JOB, TO MAKE THE WRONGS RIGHT, AND TO FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER, AND TO DROP YOURS, AND TO CHANGE YOUR WAYS, AND TO NOT JUST KNOW THE WORD, BUT LIVE the word. Oh, somebody preached back to me this evening. Hallelujah. There are many who know the message. It's a whole another thing to live the message, friends. But the true believers are those who put the word INTO PRACTICE. THEY PUT the word into action. They worship when they don't feel like worshiping BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY are born to be worshippers. Oh, somebody help me tonight. THEY COME TO CHURCH BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT CHURCH IS A PLACE TO BE. AND THEY FORSAKE NOT THE ASSEMBLING OF THEMSELVES TOGETHER EVEN AS THE DAY APPROACHES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A TRUE BELIEVER IS. A true believer is not PUTTING ON A SHOW LIKE THE BIG BELIEVER. THEY'RE NOT THERE TO IMPRESS ANYBODY BUT THEY ARE TRUE BELIEVER IF NOBODY ELSE IS STANDING. THEY ARE TRUE BELIEVER AND GOD is about to separate the true believers from the church members. There has got to be a separation. I'm not doing the separation. The pastor is not doing the separation but God himself is doing the separation. Sometime the church say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm feeling good tonight. God is going to have a witness. HE'S GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S going to break out of the humanistic realm. HE'S GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO BREAK into the realm of divine revelation, break into vision and see who they ARE IN GOD. UH THAT PICTURE OF GOD THAT THAT GOD HAS ABOUT YOU, ONCE YOU CATCH IT, THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS A DISTRACTION. EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOTHING. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS NO VALUE WHEN YOU SEE WHO GOD SAYS YOU ARE. BECAUSE WHEN GOD LOOKS AT YOU, HE SEES YOU IN A CONDITION HOW HE FORMED YOU, HOW HE SHAPED YOU. NOT THE PRODUCT OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT, NOT THE PRODUCT OF YOUR HOME, NOT THE PRODUCT OF YOUR MISTAKES, NOT THE PRODUCT OF YOUR FAILURES. BUT BEFORE THERE WAS A WORLD, BEFORE THERE WAS A MOLECULE, BEFORE THERE WAS A PROBLEM, YOU WERE IN GOD. YOU ROTATED OFF OF GOD. AND GOD HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF HIM. CAN THE church say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You in your home, you worship. Hallelujah. If you're in your job, you worship. We are born to worship. We are creatures created to worship. THERE ARE SONGS THAT THE ANGELS CANNOT SING. OH, HALLELUJAH. THERE'S AN EXPRESSION THAT THE ANGELS COULD ANGELS COULD NEVER WORSHIP LIKE YOU. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO SING THE SONGS OF AMAZING GRACE. HOW SWEET A SOUND THAT SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME. I ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW [screaming] I'M FOUND. WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Born to worship. True believers who could stand alone. That's a challenge today. People can't stand alone. We are social creatures. So people are looking to see who else is doing this and who else is doing this and who else is doing this. But the true believer just hears a word from the Lord. And if nobody else is moving, they move. Uh if NOBODY ELSE IS RESPONDING, they respond. Uh if the word is speaking to you, it has nothing to do with anybody else. YOU ARE FULLY PERSUADED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A TRUE BELIEVER IS. YOU BELIEVE ALL OF THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. MAY LORD, MAY THE LORD ELEVATE US TONIGHT TO BE TRUE BELIEVERS. IF IT CUTS ME, I STILL BELIEVE. IF I LOSE FRIENDS, I STILL BELIEVE. IF I LOSE REPUTATION, I STILL BELIEVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A TRUE BELIEVER IS. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So I want to lay a few quotes and a few things before I get to part of the thought from the message of unity of one God in the one church. But the working of the Holy Spirit, the kingdom of God in you, God sets on the throne of your heart in his control room. You see how BROTHER BRANDON DESCRIBES IT? HIS control room. It's not your control room. It's his control room. That control SEAT IN YOUR HEART doesn't belong to you. It's not your control room. It's his control room. YOU SOMETIMES HAVE ALL KIND OF THINGS INSIDE THERE CONTROLLING YOU. BUT GOD IS LOOKING to take the seat on his control room SO HE COULD DRIVE your car. He could move your handshake control of your lips. The things that YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO NOT SAY, WHEN HE SITS THERE, YOU WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE NO MORE BECAUSE HE'S IN THE CONTROL ROOM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You want to hear how the prophet continues that controlling your emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You you hear that? &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER PAPA, GOD WANTS to control your emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have people who say, "I'M AN EMOTIONAL PERSON. THAT'S WHY I ACT IN THIS WAY." And God is saying when when I SIT ON THE THRONE, I TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR EMOTIONS. &gt;&gt; Because a leader doesn't panic. A LEADER DOESN'T GET FRUSTRATED AND UPSET. A LEADER STANDS HIS GROUND BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT GROUND HE'S STANDING ON. YOU think God panic when man fell? You think God PANIC WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND THAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; The disciples screaming IN THE BOAT, "MASTER, SAVE US." JESUS WIPED HIS EYES. He say, "You of little faith. Peace be still." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine if Jesus was panicking with them. He couldn't get emotional. But faith, true belief, understands that God is in control. The Lord gives, the Lord take it away. Everything I have come FROM GOD. WHY PANIC IF I'M losing something? It didn't come from God. &gt;&gt; If the Lord give you and he can take away, why you panic? &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said worrying is a sin. We worrying about things we cannot control. GOD GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU don't think he could preserve it? AND IF GOD ALLOWS something to be removed from you, don't you think he can give US SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT HE HAD BEFORE? BECAUSE JOB GOT DOUBLE FOR HIS TROUBLE. OH, COME ON NOW. ALL THE PROBLEMS JOB HAD, GOD ALREADY HAD A TRANSFER WAITING TO GIVE HIM FOR STANDING THE TEST OF TIME. YOU DIDN'T THINK GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT, WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR HOME, THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR FAMILY, THE GOD WHO PUT YOU HERE IS MORE THAN ABLE TO PRESERVE YOU. TO HE WHO STARTED THE WORK IN YOU IS MORE THAN ABLE TO BRING IT TO PASS. But it's to get him tonight, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to sit &gt;&gt; in the control room. &gt;&gt; And I hope I could get save it where by the man I'm talking about. But the true believer is truly trusting in God. That's what belief is. &gt;&gt; People worrying about this, stressing about this. I'm guilty. We all guilty &gt;&gt; because OUR NATURE IS TO TRY TO FIX THINGS. &gt;&gt; When something goes wrong, your nature is not to sit down and say, "Let it go wrong." Your nature is say, "What can I do? What can I do better? What can I do different? AND THAT'S FINE. BUT DON'T LET THAT REPLACE YOUR TRUST IN GOD. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THAT REPLACE YOUR FAITH IN GOD. DON'T LET THAT CHANGE THE WORDS THAT COME OUT YOUR MOUTH. BECAUSE AS A FAITHBASED CREATURE, OH, come on now. AS A FAITH-BASED CREATURE, ONLY FAITH SHOULD COME OUT FROM YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW DARK IT LOOKS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE BANK SAYS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE BOSS SAYS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IF GOD SPEAKS, THAT SETTLES IT. IF HE SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE HOLY GHOST, I I DON'T CARE WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND YOU'RE going to get THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTED, YOU MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, you're going to be adopted. If he promised you your children, I don't care where they are tonight, THEY HAVE GOT TO COME BECAUSE I HAVE PROMISES unto you and TO YOUR CHILDREN. GOD IS GOING TO RAISE YOUR FAITH FOR YOUR HOUSE. AND YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD." Can the church say, "Amen." Somebody give God a shout of praise tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's the problem with many of us. We are too much in control. &gt;&gt; And when we are in control, God cannot be in control. But when you let go of the wheel and you let go of the wheel of your life and and [laughter] you want to do this and you want to and let God take control, you'll see how smooth the ride is GOING TO BE. HALLELUJAH. YOU NOT A PILOT. YOU ARE TO FLY THE PLANE OF YOUR LIFE. But if you have a good pilot who understand where the turbulence is, sometimes you're in a plane and the pilot say I'm going to go a little higher because there's some turbulence up ahead. And if you go higher, I'll fly above the turbulence. Hallelujah. The God we serve could fly above the turbulence. He could take you through the storm. HE COULD HE COULD TAKE YOU THROUGH THE HURRICANE. HE COULD PROTECT YOUR HOUSE. HE COULD PROTECT YOUR HOME. THOUGH 10,000 FALL ON THIS SIDE, HE KNOWS HOW TO CARRY YOU THROUGH. OH, CAN WE GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We're still in that quote. Controlling your emotions. This is the prophet speaking. Controlling your powers. &gt;&gt; Controlling your conceptions, your ideas. Sometime your ideas running wild. You're thinking about this. You're thinking about that. You want to do this. You want to do that. AND WHAT? BUT WHEN HE SITS IN A CONTROL TOWER, HE IS A STABILIZING FORCE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY DO HIS WILL. AND HE CAN ONLY GUIDE YOU IN HIS WILL. YOU FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY AT PEACE AND AT REST BECAUSE HE IS IN THE CONTROL TOWER AND YOU ARE BLESSED BECAUSE YOU'RE IN HIS WAY. BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNGODLY OR STAND IN THE WAY OF THE SINNER OR SIT IN THE SEAT OF THE SCORNFUL BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S THE MASTER OF THE WIND IN THE CONTROL TOWER OF THE HEART AND HE'S DIRECTING YOU GO HERE. DON'T GO HERE. STOP HERE. DO THIS. DROP YOUR SAY THAT BETTER. GO AND APOLOGIZE. GO FIX THIS. GO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND ALL THE GUILT YOU FEEL AND THE SHAME YOU FEEL BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR BECAUSE HE'S THERE TO HELP YOU. HE'S THERE TO BUILD YOU UP. HE'S THERE TO HELP DEVELOP THE CHARACTER IN YOU. THE SEED IN YOU COULD ONLY BRING FORTH AFTER ITS KIND. AND THE HOLY GHOST SEED IN YOU COULD ONLY BRING FORTH A LIVING FAITH, A LIVING GLORY, A LIVING POWER, FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT, STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. SOMEBODY GIVE God a shout of praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. We still in that court. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love. And God fills you with love. He fills you with power. He fills you with the spirit. He fills you with his own divine nature. And he changes your carnal nature into his nature. Then in this you become a new creation in Christ. Believest thou this? &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Brandham goes on then the love you God you seemingly the birds sing different &gt;&gt; what you talking your perspective change you know &gt;&gt; because when you were in your atmosphere you know brother but Brandham said somebody came into the car and spoke a blue streak it interrupted his atmosphere it interrupted his environment one time brother Brandham was walking into the hotel room he say I can't go in this room because fornication just took place in this room &gt;&gt; he is protecting thing his environment. [clears throat] HE DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE. He's in an atmosphere. He's in a bubble. He could walk the street and he could preserve the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. Nothing bothers you anymore. &gt;&gt; You're at peace. You're at rest. You're you're YOU'RE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN WHO YOU ARE IN THE LORD. YOU COULD WALK THE STREET AND nothing moves you. People having and you IN YOUR YOU IN YOUR OWN WORLD. WHAT WORLD? YOU'RE IN HEAVENLY PLACES. JOHN WAS IN THE AISLE OF PATMOS. HE DIDN'T CHANGE HIS PHYSICAL LOCATION, BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM, HE WAS CALLED COME HIGHER. HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM ALL AROUND. THEY THINK HE'S THERE, BUT HE'S CAUGHT UP IN THE HEAVENLIES, SEEING WHAT THEY CANNOT SEE, EXPERIENCING WHAT THEY CANNOT EXPERIENCE. AND YOU IN YOUR HOME TONIGHT, YOU IN HERE TONIGHT CAN BE CAUGHT UP IN THE HEAVENLY REALM AND SEE WHAT OTHERS cannot see BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPIRITUAL EYESIGHT TO ENTER INTO the realm of the heavenlies. Can the church give the Lord a shout of praise? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on how different IT IS WHEN CHRIST COME. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU LOOK BACK AND THINK HOW DID I EVER stay away from it? How did I ever reject it? Everything is different. But the man said you have no enemies. Oh Lord help us. &gt;&gt; You have no enemies. &gt;&gt; They all look sweet. This is good thing tonight you know &gt;&gt; because if you I know I know there are people you have issues with and you struggle to look at them a certain way but when that when that master of the winners is in the control tower all of your enemies suddenly become you say you have no enemies when people say I thought you don't talk to so and so no I I [laughter] have no issue I I have no enemies how is it they're looking sweet I reading the word here you know this is what the prophet say they're looking sweet I used to look AT THEM AWAY BUT SOMETHING CHANGED AND THE SAME BROTHER I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM I JUST SEEN SWEETNESS. WHAT IS IT? THE CONTROL TOWER. SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. [screaming] IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE DOING? CHANGING YOUR THINKING, CHANGING WHAT YOU LOOK AT, CHANGING BECAUSE A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENS in your mind. &gt;&gt; I feel this. This person SAY THIS AND I VEX WITH THIS AND YOU END UP CAUGHT UP AND YOU END UP CROOKED and twist up. But when the Holy Ghost come as a stabilizing FORCE AND THE TASTE CAN BE CONTROLLED, IT'S NOT EVEN A MATTER OF YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE AND FORGIVE. YOU JUST START TO LOOK AT PEOPLE DIFFERENT. YOUR ODDS JUST DROP THE PERSON WHO YOU COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH. You you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE GOD UNWIPE YOUR PERCEPTION, WIPE YOUR THINKING, DESTROY YOUR MEMORY, DESTROY IMAGINATION, WHAT YOU THOUGHT, YOUR THOUGHT, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER BECAUSE IT'S THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. When Christ come, you have no enemies. &gt;&gt; They all look sweet. You can forgive everything that's ever been done. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Not some things. YOU COULD FORGIVE EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE. THE BITTEREST of enemy. I'm reading the prophet's words. You could pray for him on the street. &gt;&gt; Put your arm around him and lift him up. WHAT A CONDITION. BROTHER TERREN, WHEN you read this, it makes you wonder about the foolishness in the message. Who can't shake one hand and who CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THAT. AND IF THIS IS NOT THAT I KEEPING this &gt;&gt; because this is something THAT I WANT WHERE NO MATTER WHAT SOMEBODY DID, WHAT SOMEBODY SAID, WHAT SOMEBODY WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH, YOU KNOW HOW LIGHT you live when you have nos, &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO GRUDGES, NOBODY BOTHERS YOU, nobody gets you upset. YOU ARE YOU ARE LIVING HIGHER. &gt;&gt; I said to somebody recently that a lion don't walk around the jungle getting wet with the ants. He's a lion. A mouse runs. So he's stressed out. You see that mouse? He's a lion. &gt;&gt; When you become so big amidst your situation and your trial after a while, they say I can't that happened that go wrong. THAT THAT IS NOTHING. IT'S AN PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Ghost to lift you up there to see. &gt;&gt; If you don't see it, THEN YOU GET TRAPPED. EVERYTHING BECOME A MOUNTAIN. Everything is a panic. YOU IN A PERMANENT PANIC ATTACK. YOUR LIFE IS WAVE AFTER WAVE OF PANIC. EVERYTHING WE CALL OH GOSH. You hear this? Calm down, brother. Calm down, brother. What happened? [clears throat] Boy, I got a flat tire. All that hysteria is a flat tire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When people get in caught up in emotion and their feelings, everything that is a everything starts to escalate and then it builds and builds and builds and builds. It's like a pressure cooker. But when the Holy Ghost come as a stabilizing force, your whole perception changes. And that's what we fighting for. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; The bitterest of enemy, you could pray for him on the street. That's a real thing. You know, this is not just forgiving on the street, but to pray for somebody, you have to be able to enter in to their needs. You want to be happy for them because that's the problem. Some people just be acting like they're happy for you and they're not. But for you to already pray for somebody, you have to be able to enter in. What do you need, brother? What do you need, sister? Let me pray for you. Let me pray with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're praying with sincerity. You're going to God know. &gt;&gt; You're praying to for them to hear you pray. You're praying for God to answer. &gt;&gt; So God is the one auditing this exchange. He's the one watching the conversation. He is seeing the sincerity and the lack of sincerity. No wonder when Jesus was here, he could say, "IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING COMMANDMENTS OF MEN." BECAUSE HE COULD see their lips moving, but there's no sincerity in there. But when the Holy Ghost comes, when you approach God, they come in with a real need. They come with a desire and God IS OBLIGATED TO RESPOND WHEN YOU COME TO THEM THE RIGHT WAY ON THE BASIS OF HIS PROMISED WORD. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; No matter what creed, what denomination he belongs to, he's a creature who Christ died for. You see how God sees it? You see how the prophet expresses it? how we have to temper and remain humble and remain with humility and a certain spirit and keep low to the ground because at the end of the day it takes God to give revelation. I can't stand here and profess to have any kind of great revelation is the grace of God. I don't have no authority, no right to be here but by the grace of God, God can move me in the morning and knock me over AND TRUST ME, THE MOMENT I'M GONE, HE'LL put a replacement BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S BUSINESS. IT'S HIS KINGDOM. It's his word. THIS IS HIS CHURCH. IT'S HIS PEOPLE. HE IS THE ONE WHO OWNS THE BENCHES. OH, come on now. It's his camera. IT'S HIS KEYBOARD. IT'S HIS MUSIC. IT'S HIS DEACONS. IT'S HIS TECHNICIANS. GOD IS THE BOSS. HE'S THE KING OF KINGS. HE SAID HE IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; WHAT RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO JUDGE SOMEBODY? WHAT RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO SAY WHO CAN MAKE IT AND WHO CAN'T MAKE IT? IT'S A God that justify it. THE GRACE OF GOD TO ALL OF US. HE'S A GOD WHO COULD PICK UP THE PROSTITUTE. HE COULD RETURN THE BANDIT. HE COULD TAKE THE MAN WHO WOULD NEVER WANTED GOD AND MAKE HIM A PREACHER. HE TOOK PAUL WHO WAS PERSECUTING CHRISTIANS, KILLED A DEACON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HEY, brother Papa. &gt;&gt; The church was impacted when brother Steven died. You know, &gt;&gt; the Bible SAY IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM TO ACCEPT BROTHER PAUL, YOU KNOW. YES. YES. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine &gt;&gt; the day brother Paul walk into a church they say not th not Saul. &gt;&gt; Deacon say put him in the back. Put him in the corner. Watch him there. Put two deacons. Put one deacon in front one deacon behind the left. One deacon to the right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was there when they when he he was the one who led Stephven being killed. &gt;&gt; It would not have been an easy thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God wasn't business with that. That was not just a man in the church. That was a messenger of the age, a star in the right hand of God. You vex with God now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God could take the murderer of a deacon, &gt;&gt; you hear what I said? If God could take the murderer of a deacon and make him an apostle and put HIM AS A STANDINY RIGHT HAND OF GOD, YOU COULD WRITE ANYBODY OFF, GOD IS ABLE TO RAISE UP ANYBODY. HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T PRAISE ME, THEN THE ROCKS ARE GOING TO CRY OUT. GOD'S GOING TO RAISE UP SONS. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. DON'T BE AFRAID. GOD IS GOING TO HAVE A SUPER CHURCH. HE'S GOING TO RAISE UP SONS, RAISE UP DAUGHTERS. DON'T BE BOTHERED ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE. GOD IS GOING [screaming] TO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL STAND FOR THIS MESSAGE. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. LIFT YOUR SHOULDERS UP. SPEAK POSITIVE AND WATCH GOD MOVE. HE'S GOING TO MOVE INTO YOUR HOME. HE'S GOING TO MOVE INTO YOUR SITUATION. HE'S GOING TO DELIVER THE YOUNG PEOPLE. LET ME PROPHESY. HE'S GOING TO RAISE THEM UP. HE'S GOING TO BREAK THE POWER OF SIN. AND GIVE THEM A REAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T be words and rules. And now I understand it will be the living Christ in the CONTROL TOWER OF THEIR HEART. WHEN YOU SEE THEM ON FIRE, YOU'LL be amazed TO SEE WHAT GOD DONE. HALLELUJAH. WHAT THE LORD SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It will be THE LORD'S DOING AND IT'LL BE MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES. WE WILL REJOICE. WE'LL BE GLAD WHEN WE SEE IT. AND [laughter] IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE GOD SAID IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Every true seed of God has an appointment with the supernatural. That same Saul who became Paul &gt;&gt; wasn't looking for Jesus when he was on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; He was on a mission to find more Christians to destroy. But when his time came, his time came. And God didn't send an angel. He came himself. &gt;&gt; And he knocked HIM OFF HIS HORSE. HALLELUJAH. AND HE SAID, "IS IS IT ME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?" OH, COME [laughter] ON NOW. HALLELUJAH. WHO YOU LOOKING FOR? BECAUSE YOU PICKED THE WRONG ONE. I CAME TO FIND YOU. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ME. I COME TO FIND YOU. I HAVE A WORK FOR YOU TO DO. I HAVE A MISSION FOR YOU TO DO. GOD IS GOING TO TAKE BACKSLIDERS AND TURN THEM INTO PREACHERS. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME TONIGHT. HE'S GOING TO TAKE A WAYWARD BROTHER AND MAKE HIM AN EVANGELIST. HE'S GOING TO STICK THE SISTER AND MAKE HER A PRAYER WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD I SERVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged, church. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what being a true believer is about. &gt;&gt; It's being elevated above what you could see &gt;&gt; because that's a test of your belief when it doesn't look good &gt;&gt; to believe that God is able. &gt;&gt; More than &gt;&gt; more than able. Thank you, brother Terren. Not just able, more than able. That's the true test of if you're a TRUE BELIEVER. WHEN IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, LISTEN. WHEN IT LOOKING GOOD, it don't take faith. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? When it looking good with a joy, it don't already take faith, you know, because it looking good. &gt;&gt; It takes looking good. It already take much from us. BUT FAITH STARTS TO GET VALUABLE WHEN it don't look good. &gt;&gt; If the doctor say you're looking good, then you don't have faith. &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house tonight? &gt;&gt; IF THE DOCTOR SAY CLEAN BILL [screaming] OF HEALTH, &gt;&gt; then you could walk out feeling good. They going to drink some soft [clears throat] drink and all kind of &gt;&gt; clean bill of health. When the doctor start to say well here it it looking good enough. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he say looking good that is when your account of faith start to get tested. You ask yourself how much I have in this account boy. &gt;&gt; Because your faith need to fill the gap between good bill of health and not so good bill of health. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they go back again and the doctor say still looking good and know then you it's a withdrawal from your faith account. &gt;&gt; So when we come faith comes by hearing the word. &gt;&gt; So every time you come to church is really you really trying to get a deposit of faith to know. Oh come on now somebody help me. And when you hear the positive faith that he is the god that health and by HIS STRIPES YOU ARE HEALED. And who he for you he called and WHO HE CALL HE JUSTIFIED AND WHO HE JUSTIFIED HE HAD ALREADY GLORIFIED PAST TENSE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm realizing how much this is why the scripture say when the son of man cometh shall he find faith and I was even reading in Hebrews because when you read through Hebrews I seen it was so striking because when it reached the part say these all died IN FAITH. &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE DIED IN FAITH. HEBREWS 11. &gt;&gt; So it means these guys here die in doubt. No, they die down to the end in faith, you know. &gt;&gt; And that faith is counted as a currency. &gt;&gt; So this whole thing, so there's such a thing as living BY FAITH IS ALSO DYING IN FAITH. &gt;&gt; But the teaching here is BEING IN FAITH BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW THAT GOD RIGHT TO CALL YOU HOME, YOU'RE GOING HOME IN FAITH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT FAITH IS THE FAITH THAT WILL CONNECT TO RESURRECTION FAITH BECAUSE THIS BODY IS A PESS HOUSE. THIS BODY, WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT. WHETHER THROUGH THE RAPTURE OR THROUGH THE GRAVE, THIS BODY FINISHED. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER BODY WAITING FOR US. &gt;&gt; AND THAT BODY IS BETTER THAN THIS BODY. THAT BODY CAN NEVER GET SICK, NEVER GET TIRED, NEVER GET DEPRESSED. THAT'S WHO [screaming] I REALLY AM. THAT'S MY THEOPHONY. AND MY THEOPHONY IS CALLING FOR ME TONIGHT. HE'S SAYING, "STAND THERE BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU AND [screaming] I WILL BE TOGETHER." OH, SOMEBODY HELP ME TONIGHT. THAT'S WHY PAUL COULD SAY DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING? GRAVE WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY? BECAUSE THAT REVELATION WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT THIS BODY IS NOTHING. THIS 16 ELEMENTS IS NOT WHO I AM. I'M JUST A PASSING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; So whether IN THIS OR THE NEXT, I AM WHO I AM. I EXIST HERE BECAUSE I EXIST SOMEWHERE ELSE. OH, COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT BECOMING SEED. YOU ARE SEED. AND BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, YOU COULD BE REBORN. BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTED. &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that helps you live &gt;&gt; a certain way, act a certain way, walk a certain way, talk a certain way, operate a certain way in your work environment. Why are you a prince? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SON OF THE KING. YOU'RE CALLED TO A HIGHER CALLING. YOU'RE LIVING IN THE HIGHER CALLING. YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR THE LAST MOMENT TO SAY TO step into it. No, you're walking into it now. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Still in that same quote. I still trying to get out that quote, but like I staying in there. &gt;&gt; He said we are not to further a denomination, not to further a cult or some creed. We're one to further the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we take his blueprint and every time the blessed Bible says anything, the Holy Spirit in you cries out, "It's so it's my word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I've said, man, in the message faith in the sons of God, no man seeks after God. God seeks after man. Man in his nature is a rebellion against God. &gt;&gt; He's against God. But God loves the man. Since the fall in the Garden of Eden, God has still been calling for his child. And he calls him through the thunder, through the lightning, through the setting of the sun, through the preaching of the gospel, through signs and wonders, through prophets, through miracles, through visions, God speaking to his people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in God commissioning Moses. Brother said, "And one of the doctors said, "Well, I tell you, I find this that the GREATEST POWER IN THE world &gt;&gt; is not the atomic bomb, but a believer in contact with his maker." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say that one more time? &gt;&gt; The greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb, but a believer in contact with his maker. It changes the whole attitude. Changes his mental. It changes his habit. IT CHANGES HIS BODY. IT CHANGES HIS NATURE. EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; And friends, when you think about it, we live our lives every day. And if you don't stay in the presence and read the word and think, you could forget who you are. You know, &gt;&gt; you get caught up in politic, caught up in the news, caught up in this and all that. Look, this whole thing that was last week with the quote unquote war, all that fizzle out, boy, it looking like bad as we say. People caught up in the hysteria one minute, then it gone. This cycle of life that is just meant to take you from distraction to distraction. And if you get caught up in that world of distraction to distraction, you'll realize when you look back over time, because time compounds what we do not do and time compounds what we do. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? In the heat of the moment, you don't really realize what you didn't do and what you did. But when you look back over the last month, the last year, the last 5 years, and you measure how much progress you make, then you realize, but wait a minute, you know, if I had just do a hour of this thing a day, I've been in a different place. Many times people WONDER HOW I REACH HERE and it's because as they say with a plane just one degree off over time you in a different country you know over two three minutes you don't feel the impact you know but over a month over two months over a year over two years you was trying to go to Canada and you in Spain because that one degree off carry you carry you carry you carry you until you realize that you're not where you're supposed to be all along and then they ask yourself but how I end up here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's one degree in your life that not ALIGN CORRECTLY &gt;&gt; AND JUST PUT TIME ON IT &gt;&gt; and you don't realize you miss your prayer life. You miss the word. You're in the wrong conversations, spending time with the wrong people, and before you know it, you have to be asking, "But how do I return to my first love?" &gt;&gt; Because that's what happened to the early church. You know, &gt;&gt; it wasn't a over it wasn't they leave Sunday and by the next day they it was over time slowly slowly slowly over time they stopped doing this and they stopped doing this until until church became a routine and church became casual. &gt;&gt; But the true believers are not like that because the truly believers are looking to anchor themselves in the word. &gt;&gt; The true believers are trying to find ways to ensure THAT THEY READ THEIR BIBLES AND PRAY every day. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN THE WORD. THEY ARE PLAYING THE TAPES. THEY ARE READING THE QUOTES BECAUSE IT'S A DISCIPLINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The discipline of the word. &gt;&gt; What did God tell Joshua? Meditate on the word &gt;&gt; and you'll have good success. &gt;&gt; When anybody say I'm not being success successful, the one question I had to ask is are you meditating on the word day or night? &gt;&gt; When you start, do not come back to me. Then we can analyze what the issue is. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if the formula is meditate on the word day and night and you'll have good success. Then before we do a audit, let me audit that now. &gt;&gt; Because God give us a formula. Meditate on the word day and night. In other words, let it be a practice. What does God say? How does God want me to move? Make him I heard somebody say, put him on your board of directors. Put him on your team. You working ALONE IN YOUR OFFICE. PUT JESUS ON YOUR TEAM and see what's happen in your work. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? BRING JESUS INSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND SEE HOW YOUR HOUSE CHANGE. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me just drop a few thoughts here so we could start to find a place to land this evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To help us. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the separation or separating the true believers from their church members. Those who want this as a gospel of convenience. Brother Brandham said here in the message the queen of Sheba now some people look at their symptoms and we could read this and we have read this course many times and what I've realized I don't know what your experience is but many of these things sound good when you hearing it and it's not you but when is your issue suddenly it is be different you know like I said some ago you could say have faith have faith have faith and you can tell your brother have faith you're going through a rough time But pap hold on hold on. But when your turn come and you are telling yourself hold on you throw up your hand you recognize wait now all them brother I tell hold on I struggling to hold on you know because the problem becomes your problem. So you can tell somebody don't LOOK AT THE SYMPTOMS LOOK AT GOD because you don't have the problem but when the problem come to your house you have a list of all the symptoms. Symptom number one, symptom number two, symptom pastor, look at all the symptoms. But here the word is saying to us, people look at their symptoms. My pastor prayed for me last time, but my hands know better. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you are really a believer, you don't even look at that. It's already settled forever. God healed you. MAY THIS BE A STATEMENT OF FAITH FOR EVERYONE WHO HEARING THIS TONIGHT. WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SYMPTOM IS, WHAT THE FEELING IS. GOD IS A HEALER. HE HAS ALREADY HEALED YOU BY HIS STRIPES. YOU ARE ALREADY HEALED. MAY YOUR FAITH RISE TO THAT AS A TRUE BELIEVER. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE AFFLICTION IS. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, CANCER, DIABETES, FEMALE CONDITION, WHATEVER IT IS, BY HIS STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. THAT SETTLES THE MATTER. TAKE THAT TO THE DEVIL. TAKE THAT TO THE DOCTOR. TAKE THAT TO THE WORLD. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT TRUE BELIEVERS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I believe in I believe in I believe in it has to become a reality to you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It has to be a reality to YOU AND YOUR WORDS HAVE TO ALIGN WITH IT. YOUR THINKING HAS TO ALIGN WITH IT. YOUR BEHAVIOR HAS TO ALIGN WITH IT. COUNTING THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT AS THOUGH THEY WERE. SO YOUR CHILD IS ALREADY DELIVERED. DON'T LOOK AT WHERE THEY AT TONIGHT. THEY ARE DELIVERED. WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU ABOUT THEM, SAY THEY'RE DELIVERED. BUT ARE YOU SEEING THEM? I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. THEY ARE DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; That woman with the dead BOY &gt;&gt; WHEN HE DIED in the field and she PUT HIM ON THE CHARIOT AND SHE GOING TO THE PROPHET AND THEY SAY, "WHAT GOING ON? WHY YOU BREAKING THESE FIELD LIMIT?" SHE SAY, "ALL IS WELL. ALL IS WELL." WHAT IS SHE? SHE'S LOOKING AT FAITH. &gt;&gt; SHE KNOWS IF SHE COULD GET IN TOUCH WITH A PROPHET. ALL IS WELL. &gt;&gt; DON'T DISTRACT ME. ALL IS WELL. DON'T SLOW ME DOWN. ALL IS WELL. I'M ON A MISSION. I'M NOT TAKING THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS, YOUR IDEAS, WHAT YOU THINK, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE WAS WHEN YOU WAS GOING THROUGH IT. THAT WHAT IT WAS. ALL IS WELL. FAITH HAS A BELINE. IT HAS A DIRECT LINE TO THE WORD OF GOD. OH, CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? Some of us talking too much &gt;&gt; to the wrong people and the voices telling you, well, it mightn't be so, it mightn't BE SO. PERHAPS YOU KNOW ALL IS WELL. FAITH TAKES YOU HIGHER. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? True believers, we have got to be ANCHORED IN FAITH. WHEN THE SON OF MAN COMETH, SHALL HE FIND FAITH? &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT [screaming] TO BE A CHURCH WITH FAITH. EVEN SEVEN THUNDER FAITH BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE SEVEN THUNDER FAITH TO CARRY THE BRIDE OUT OF HERE. AND SEVEN THUNDERS GIVES FAITH. SEVEN THUNDERS SHOWS US HOW TO GO. SEVEN THUNDERS GIVES THE BRIDE A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; SEVEN THUNDERS GATHERS THE BRIDE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Levels of faith from dingy faith all the way to rapture and faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us how can we have faith for the rapture if you got faith for DIVINE HEALING. THERE'S GOT TO BE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING. AND GOD WILL PLACE SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE IN THE CHURCH TO TEST YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, GOD IS GOING TO SAY, "STAY RIGHT THERE AND BELIEVE IT. SAY IT. PREACH IT. DO IT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Look how Jesus spoke. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lazarus is dead. &gt;&gt; Jesus say I go wake him. &gt;&gt; He not going to awaken. No. &gt;&gt; Even his words. And I'm trying to teach us something. And I'm speaking to myself as well. Our words are powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Life and death is in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; If you shall say to this mountain, be moved. &gt;&gt; There's a connection between your words and your faith. If you shall say to this mountain, be moved. And don't doubt in your heart, you will have it. &gt;&gt; The two have to work together. &gt;&gt; Your words and your faith. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me YOU HAVE FAITH, BUT YOU'RE speaking doubt. And you can't SPEAK IF YOU DON'T HAVE REAL FAITH BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUBSTANCE BEHIND THE WORDS. BUT IF YOU HAVE FAITH like a mustard seed, &gt;&gt; God say it's a small SEED, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FAITH AND YOU COULD SPEAK to your situation and count the things that are not as THOUGH THEY WERE. THEN THERE'S nothing will be able to stand before you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is what God is looking for in this end time bride &gt;&gt; because we are promised the spoken word. &gt;&gt; And that word only operates with favor. And God thinks something and expresses it. He expects it to be there and it's there. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? May God help us to for our faith to rise tonight to begin to speak what's in the word concerning our lives because you have a right as a son and daughter OF GOD TO APPLY THE WORD FOR YOUR HOUSE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What if Abraham would have looked that next month to see if Sarah was going to have the baby?" He never noticed that. He just noticed what God said. And any true believer looks to the promise, not what symptoms are around them. This is an encouragement to brother Hugh, encouragement to brother Terren, encouragement to anybody going through anything tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the symptoms say. Whose report will you believe? WE SHALL believe the report of the Lord. AND IN THE LORD'S REPORT, ALL IS WELL. IN THE LORD'S REPORT, YOU ARE HEALED. IN THE LORD'S REPORT, YOUR BODY ALREADY GETTING BACK YOUNG AGAIN. IN YOUR OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME TONIGHT. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; FAITH LOOKS AT THE IMPOSSIBLE AND SAY IT'S POSSIBLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; FAITH LOOKS AT IT BEING BROKEN AND SAY IT IS WELL BECAUSE JESUS STOOD THERE AT A DEAD MAN'S GRAVE AND SAY LAZARUS COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And that was a defining moment in Jesus's ministry. Because up until that time he was saying don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. But do you know that when Lazarus came forth that is when water was more than flour because they came after that brother Steven to see Jesus but they already was looking for Lazarus &gt;&gt; they say brother Lazarus here but Lazarus here because we heard he was dead but look him look him look him at that point they couldn't keep it SECRET NO MORE EVERY SAY HEY THIS THING IS REAL THIS THING IS REVIVAL THIS THING THEY COULDN'T KEEP QUIET anymore [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; and God is going to have a situation and situation by the terance that will require such faith.

JUST AS MUCH AS DIVINE FAITH, JUST AS MUCH AS FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory in the message. Who is this? And we know Lord that thy church is not in the majority this morning, this evening. The true believers are in THE MINORITY. BUT SOMEDAY, LORD, YOU WILL TAKE THAT minority to yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we take a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; The prophet said in the message, Micaiah the prophet, &gt;&gt; all true prophets, all true Christians, all true believers stay with that word. No matter what anybody says, you stay right with the word. They say the days of miracle is passed. Don't you believe it? THEY SAY REVIVAL IS PASSED. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? &gt;&gt; They say speaking IN TONGUES IS PASSED. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? &gt;&gt; THEY SAY SHOUTING ON THE HILLS OF GLORY HAS PASSED. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY SAY THERE'S NO OTHER POWER TO COME. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? BECAUSE THERE'S A SUPER CHURCH THAT'S GOT TO COME INTO POWER. THERE'S AN ANOINTING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THIS BRIDE HIGHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; If somebody don't have faith to believe it, don't limit my faith. &gt;&gt; If you want to take a helicopter, YOU TAKE A HELICOPTER. I WANT A PLANE THAT COULD BREAK PAST THE SOUND BARRIER. I WANT TO GET A ROCKET. &gt;&gt; WE THE ASTRONAUT AGE. YOU WANT TO FLY A HELICOPTER? NO PROBLEM. I'M NOT STOPPING YOU. GO IN A HELICOPTER. BUT WE ARE SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. THE VEHICLE WE WANT HAVE TO BREAK PAST THE SONG BARRIER. &gt;&gt; Take us straight to glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't limit my faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We serve a big God. &gt;&gt; This is a a clarion call to those that are sick among us. &gt;&gt; You believe for the rapture, sickness has got to be dealt with &gt;&gt; because sickness, if God could change his body from mortal to immortality, he could heal your man. You have to believe it. You have TO SEE IT. YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE IT. IF THE PROMISE IS THIS OLD GRAY HEAD AND THIS BOY going to get young again, HE COULD TAKE CARE OF YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; DIABETES IS NOTHING TO GOD. CANCER IS NOTHING TO GOD. LEUKEMIA IS NOTHING TO GOD. TUBICULOSIS IS NOTHING TO GOD IS NOTHING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE POWER TO PUT SATAN UNDER OUR FEET. &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THIS CHURCH HAS TO RISE. THE POWER OF YOUR FAITH HAS TO RISE UNTIL YOU WALK OVER THESE THINGS. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? MAY IT START TONIGHT. MAY IT START NOW. MAY IT START IN YOUR HOME. ALL IS WELL. GOD IS IN CONTROL. THERE'S A POWER THAT'S RISING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet taught us the moment THE MOMENT THE BRIDE GETS TO KNOW WHO SHE IS, THEN THE RAPTURE COULD GO. SO ON THE JOURNEY, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW HEALING IS YOURS. YOU GOT TO KNOW REVIVAL IS YOURS. YOU GOT TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY IS YOURS. AND YOU WALK OUT OF HERE SPEAKING IT.

And if there's anyone with a request tonight you want to show by raising your hands. And that applies both here in the sanctuary and even if you are connected online right now, lift your hand right where you are as we unite in faith as the church of the living God to bring all of these requests before the heavenly father. Lord Jesus, we come to you tonight, Lord, on the basis of faith. Lord, the currency of eternity, the currency of heaven, Lord, standing on the confession of our faith, Lord, with a revelation that Lord, you are not now healing. You're not now doing it, but it is already done. Father, it's a finished work. And we are writing a check from what has already been done. Lord, the healing power is available. And we are making a withdrawal, Lord, from the account in the sky, Lord. Lord, everything we could ever desire, Lord, has already been taken care of in your word when it comes to these things, Father. So, Lord, we bring Lord Raymond Anwine before you, Lord. He's in the ICU on life support, Father. Lord, may you visit him where he is right now. And may you bring healing from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, Lord, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father, may he come to know you by revelation and by experience, Lord. You've seen every hand raised. My hands are raised also tonight, Father. Lord, we are looking for a touch. We We have so many different needs that we are bringing to you. We for you, Lord, tonight, Lord. We pray, dear, God, that you would minister, Lord, to each one that you would, Lord, address each situation. You would resolve each issue. We bring it all to you. Your word teaches us to cast all [laughter] of our cares upon you, Father. And that's what we are doing tonight. WE ARE BRINGING ALL our cares before you knowing that you are more than able to deal with every single one of them and you can deal with them at the same time tonight. Father, you are still Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah Ned. YOU ARE LORD, YOU ARE ALL IN [screaming] ALL EL SHAI. LORD, you are able to resolve every situation. Lord, may you bless your church. May you bless your people. May you bless our pastor, Lord, as he is traveling even as we speak tonight. Grant traveling mercies to him.
