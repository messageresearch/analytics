[51:32] i could find to put on my clothes to
[51:34] brush my teeth
[51:36] to get up this morning and to go into
[51:38] the house of god that's the one reason
[51:40] i could find because i believe this work

[51:50] amen i believe you believe this morning
[51:52] amen
[51:54] praise god according to the working of
[51:55] his mighty power
[51:57] which you wrote in christ when he raised
[52:00] him from the dead resurrection power
[52:02] isn't that right and set him at his own
[52:04] right hand in heavenly places
[52:06] far above all principalities and powers
[52:09] and might and dominion
[52:10] and every name that is named not only in
[52:13] this world
[52:14] but also in that which is to come he is
[52:17] still christ
[52:18] he's the lord over there isn't that
[52:19] right and i put all things under his
[52:21] feet
[52:22] and gave him to be the head over all
[52:24] things to the church which is his body
[52:26] the fullness of him uh that filth all in
[52:29] all
[52:30] amen isn't that right praise god praise
[52:33] god do you believe this morning
[52:35] all right so let's get to it now the key
[52:36] to the door
[52:39] amen this message came to me by the will
[52:41] of the holy ghost
[52:42] it says the key to the door here prophet
[52:44] said now a key
[52:46] he said i noticed here as we read he was
[52:48] reading from
[52:49] revelation uh 20 i think 20 verse one
[52:52] said when that angel come down from
[52:53] heaven having the key in his hand
[52:56] to the bottomless pit and so on he said
[52:57] i believe uh revelation 13 or 19
[53:00] we find again another angel coming down
[53:02] with a key
[53:03] he said on a key the purpose of a key is
[53:06] to unlock something
[53:09] he said something that's been locked up
[53:11] or something that
[53:12] should be locked up oh can you follow me
[53:16] this morning
[53:17] a key hallelujah is something that is is
[53:20] something to open
[53:21] or unlock something that's been locked
[53:23] up or something that should be locked up
[53:24] isn't that right
[53:25] but a key is given for that purpose so
[53:28] now there are many
[53:29] different kinds of keys the prophet said
[53:31] because we have many
[53:32] uses of keys and there is keys
[53:35] to the storehouses he says there's key
[53:38] to your own house
[53:39] so he's talking about natural keys all
[53:41] right there's a key to your automobile
[53:42] amen a key to your car
[53:44] if you didn't have it you couldn't get
[53:46] in you'd have access
[53:47] to your car if you don't have your keys
[53:50] when you lost your keys you have to get
[53:51] a hanger
[53:53] and bend it or sit anyway i put it
[53:55] inside
[53:56] the driver's side window and try to fish
[53:58] out the lock
[53:59] because you don't have the key but if
[54:01] you have to keep
[54:02] you open it pray so easy that's what a
[54:06] key is for isn't that right
[54:07] hallelujah he said we call them keys and
[54:10] they are keys
[54:11] and they can be duplicated many times he
[54:14] said on a key cannot unlock a door
[54:16] watch until it is used by a hand
[54:20] he said it's got to have something to
[54:22] use the key
[54:24] and he said the key in itself cannot use
[54:27] itself
[54:28] it's got to have something to yield the
[54:31] key
[54:33] amen and he draws a reference he says
[54:34] it's like this microphone that i'm
[54:36] speaking through
[54:37] this microphone is a mute this
[54:39] microphone
[54:40] unless there's something to speak
[54:42] through it it cannot speak to itself
[54:45] it's got to have something to speak to
[54:48] it
[54:48] oh hallelujah isn't that right something
[54:51] uses a microphone
[54:53] so he said so it's not the microphone
[54:55] it's the voice or rather the noise
[54:57] behind the microphone
[54:59] that transmit the airwaves to your air
[55:02] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[55:04] right amen amen amen hallelujah you are
[55:07] not the holy ghost
[55:08] but the holy ghost comes into you and
[55:11] uses you
[55:12] uses your hands your body your feet oh
[55:15] hallelujah isn't that right
[55:17] oh hallelujah that's what it is amen we
[55:20] become a vessel
[55:22] that god could use once you are yielded
[55:24] enough
[55:25] once you are surrendered enough then god
[55:28] drops down
[55:29] and uses that vessel a vessel fit
[55:33] for the master's use oh
[55:36] same man somebody
[55:39] hallelujah said no that's the way it is
[55:41] in preaching the gospel
[55:43] it is not we ourselves hallelujah he
[55:46] created us not we ourselves we are his
[55:50] people
[55:51] and the sheep of his pasture oh
[55:53] hallelujah
[55:54] you were created by god for god's
[55:57] purpose
[55:58] and no devil could stop it i don't care

[58:14] our agency of men to the hero
[58:18] amen is now so god uses man amen the

[59:20] or whatever whatever in part in part
[59:22] until we come to perfection hallelujah

[1:00:01] to to be held in a hand that unlocks the
[1:00:03] door
[1:00:04] i follow it this morning he said now see
[1:00:06] it's got to be a hand
[1:00:08] now and then the key that i'm speaking
[1:00:09] about tonight it's only one hand
[1:00:12] that can hold this key he said it's a
[1:00:14] hand of faith
[1:00:16] he says the only thing that can hold his
[1:00:17] key and hands hold other keys
[1:00:20] he said it takes a hand of faith for
[1:00:22] that
[1:00:23] he said now uh uh paragraph 41 he said
[1:00:26] now we take like the key to knowledge
[1:00:29] so he brings out different keys now i
[1:00:30] love it watch how he breaks this down
[1:00:32] he said now a man has two if he's trying
[1:00:35] to accumulate knowledge
[1:00:36] see there's a key to that there's a key
[1:00:39] to knowledge to learning
[1:00:40] amen isn't that right there's a way to
[1:00:42] this man he said there's a way that this
[1:00:44] man has to open up
[1:00:46] has to be has to get his books and his
[1:00:48] learning he said he cannot
[1:00:50] listen to this he said no one can learn
[1:00:52] him
[1:00:53] he said they might teach him but he has
[1:00:56] to learn
[1:00:57] and the only way that it can be done is
[1:00:59] that he has to catch that key
[1:01:02] that's something in there that unfolds
[1:01:04] or reveals to him the knowledge
[1:01:06] that he is seeking oh hallelujah
[1:01:10] praise god so you've got to catch that
[1:01:12] key
[1:01:13] and once you catch that key you could
[1:01:14] unlock it no matter how much a teacher
[1:01:17] try to teach
[1:01:18] until they're blue in the face unless
[1:01:20] the student is open up
[1:01:22] and ready to learn you cannot receive
[1:01:24] anything
[1:01:25] he that received me receiving him that
[1:01:27] sent me
[1:01:28] oh hallelujah praise god isn't that
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:32] and there are people like would try to
[1:01:33] play a piano see
[1:01:35] talk about the key of knowledge now he's
[1:01:36] talking about the key of music
[1:01:38] he said trying to play a piano and music
[1:01:40] and so on he said they just don't know
[1:01:41] how to do it
[1:01:43] but they could go there to a teacher
[1:01:44] might take a lesson after a lesson
[1:01:46] they would never learn it just can't
[1:01:48] hold that key to that mystery
[1:01:51] how the rhythm and the sounds and tuning
[1:01:53] and everything report rings out
[1:01:55] he said it takes a key isn't that right
[1:01:58] now listen you set a key usually when it
[1:02:00] turns a lock
[1:02:01] you find a key it's got to be some
[1:02:03] treasure now listen to this
[1:02:06] a key usually when it turns the lock and
[1:02:09] when you find a key
[1:02:11] there's got to be some treasure
[1:02:14] something that's worthwhile isn't that
[1:02:15] right something that's hidden
[1:02:17] or you wouldn't even lock it up if it
[1:02:20] ain't worth
[1:02:21] locking up then just let it go there's
[1:02:24] no value in it
[1:02:25] do it make sense opening it but if
[1:02:27] there's a value behind there
[1:02:30] you'll be interested to know if you got
[1:02:32] some inheritance behind it
[1:02:34] if you got some wealth behind there
[1:02:36] holla you would be interested to know
[1:02:41] isn't that right but it take a key to
[1:02:43] get in there
[1:02:44] isn't that right come like you have a
[1:02:46] mansion for a big house
[1:02:48] and you have a flat screen in there you
[1:02:50] have our nine seats so friendly
[1:02:52] you have a jacuzzi in there you have a
[1:02:54] hot tub in there
[1:02:56] you have a water cooler and whatever and
[1:02:58] whatever and you stand up on the
[1:02:59] pavement telling everybody
[1:03:01] about what you have in your house and
[1:03:03] you're professing and you're testifying
[1:03:05] that was real nice boy and it take real
[1:03:07] long to build but we finally built it
[1:03:09] praise god but if you don't have a key
[1:03:11] to get in there
[1:03:13] and enjoy the pleasures that are inside
[1:03:14] of the house
[1:03:16] what scenes that make you have a nice
[1:03:19] door
[1:03:19] a pretty door a doorway video
[1:03:22] surveillance system
[1:03:23] hallelujah but if you can't get in there
[1:03:26] it don't make sense
[1:03:28] i better tell you when they get a key
[1:03:29] come back and find me and then show me
[1:03:31] the house
[1:03:32] because they're talking about something
[1:03:34] but i can't see it we have to unlock it
[1:03:36] in order to see it we have to open the
[1:03:38] door in order to see
[1:03:40] what's inside and i believe god has
[1:03:43] given us
[1:03:44] keys to open the door to his blessing
[1:03:47] to his power to his glory to his
[1:03:50] omnipotence
[1:03:52] oh come on now come on now behind the
[1:03:54] doors of the holy ghost
[1:03:56] behind the door is your holy ghost

[1:03:59] anointing
[1:04:00] behind the door is your presence behind
[1:04:02] the door hallelujah is everything god
[1:04:05] promised

[1:04:08] need this morning
[1:04:09] is a key to open that door
[1:04:15] come on somebody oh hallelujah so a key
[1:04:26] usually
[1:04:27] is the note to something or the way to
[1:04:30] enter something that's worthwhile
[1:04:33] the key and that's what it's for now
[1:04:35] it'll unlock something
[1:04:37] that's worthwhile now we read in st john
[1:04:39] 10

[1:12:57] the key to the door wow
[1:13:01] it was fate the key of faith in a living
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:06] the hand of that man that woman who can
[1:13:07] take the key of faith they can unlock
[1:13:09] every promise of god made but if you
[1:13:12] haven't got that key
[1:13:13] you're just pragging you'll never unlock
[1:13:16] it
[1:13:17] you'll beat against it because this key
[1:13:20] he said any correct key that made that
[1:13:22] has levels on the inside of the lock
[1:13:26] and it takes a certain form a certain
[1:13:28] shape of them keys to
[1:13:29] turn those levers loose and just one
[1:13:32] little lever out of the way
[1:13:34] will mess the whole thing up now here
[1:13:37] the prophet says
[1:13:38] therefore i believe in the full gospel
[1:13:42] every word of god and that is what turns
[1:13:45] the power
[1:13:46] of god loose it cannot be 99 and
[1:13:49] nine-tenths
[1:13:50] it has to be the full word of god
[1:13:52] hallelujah
[1:13:53] to unlock the door hallelujah in this
[1:13:56] last day
[1:13:57] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:13:59] to god hallelujah
[1:14:01] isn't that right that's why we say the
[1:14:03] seventh seal is open
[1:14:05] because we can't preach a closed book to
[1:14:07] you if it was six seals
[1:14:09] the book would still be closed because
[1:14:11] there were straps
[1:14:12] holding that scrolling position but when
[1:14:15] the seventh seal was broke
[1:14:16] the contents of the scroll was open
[1:14:20] and your inheritance your promise your
[1:14:23] name on the book
[1:14:24] your children your family being
[1:14:26] delivered was in that scroll
[1:14:29] and he opened the scroll and he revealed
[1:14:32] every mystery
[1:14:33] and he'll open every promise to the
[1:14:36] bride
[1:14:37] to you this morning how can i help but
[1:14:40] praise him
[1:14:40] how can i help but shout when i
[1:14:43] understand
[1:14:44] that that book is an open book
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:50] hallelujah without the vision
[1:14:53] the people perish so malachi 4 come down
[1:14:55] with an open vision
[1:14:57] here it is here it is hallelujah come
[1:14:59] down with open vision
[1:15:01] reveal it through his prophet so that
[1:15:03] you could see it
[1:15:04] because if you see it you can have it oh
[1:15:07] hallelujah if you see it for yourself
[1:15:09] only you can run
[1:15:10] and not be reary you can walk or not
[1:15:13] pinch because you've got a key
[1:15:15] that goes the distance even when your
[1:15:17] human spirit fails
[1:15:19] even when trials come when testings come
[1:15:22] it doesn't matter
[1:15:23] the key inside you as you fearless
[1:15:26] and reckless and change you don't care
[1:15:29] what tomorrow holds
[1:15:30] you hold hallelujah a key in your hand
[1:15:34] and you know who holds tomorrow
[1:15:38] oh i got a key that says so i got a key
[1:15:41] that says my family is coming

[1:15:44] filled with the holy ghost on fire

[1:15:48] i got a key that says there's no
[1:15:50] coronavirus
[1:15:51] that can stop the omnipotence of god i
[1:15:54] got a key that says the devil is a liar
[1:15:56] i got a key that says i have a right to
[1:15:58] worship god
[1:16:00] in the temple of my god i didn't come
[1:16:02] here
[1:16:03] to warm a church bench i came here to
[1:16:05] worship god

[1:16:09] have a key
[1:16:10] that says so somebody say man
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:21] [Applause]
[1:16:26] all right so i believe the full gospel
[1:16:28] the word of god
[1:16:29] because that is what turns the power of
[1:16:31] god loose and turns his blessings to the
[1:16:33] people
[1:16:34] it's the key to the door that unlocks it
[1:16:37] all those great heroes those prophets
[1:16:40] men of greater the bible they had that
[1:16:42] key
[1:16:42] that's the reason they can stop the
[1:16:44] mount of lions quench the violence of
[1:16:45] fire
[1:16:46] escape the edge of the sword bring the
[1:16:48] dead back to life again

[1:16:52] when this key
[1:16:53] is open to you you could do the same
[1:16:55] thing
[1:16:57] we're gonna leap over walls holland is
[1:17:00] that right
[1:17:01] we're gonna stop the demons hallelujah
[1:17:03] we're gonna arrest the devils
[1:17:05] followed by a spoken word
[1:17:11] when joshua helike says son stand still
[1:17:14] we have more battle to fight we have
[1:17:16] more enemy to fight
[1:17:17] there is yet more land to be possessed i
[1:17:19] ain't gonna let the sun stop me
[1:17:21] because i have a key that says otherwise
[1:17:24] so son stand still oh
[1:17:27] hallelujah hallelujah and the sun stayed
[1:17:30] there and the moon stayed there
[1:17:32] and they overcame the battle and you
[1:17:35] overcome your battle god's gonna give
[1:17:37] you power
[1:17:38] power over the elements power over every
[1:17:40] living every creeping thing

[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:02] somebody say hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:18:06] hallelujah
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] oh hallelujah all those great heroes
[1:18:15] my they had that key the prophet said
[1:18:17] that's the reason
[1:18:18] isn't that right because i held our key
[1:18:20] all right so we got that
[1:18:22] amen said prophet said so now if i'm
[1:18:24] programming with a creed key
[1:18:26] he said i won't know what to do
[1:18:30] if i'm proclaimed with some other
[1:18:31] interpretation key
[1:18:33] it can't work it might jimmy look
[1:18:38] but it won't go in because it's not
[1:18:40] shaped to fit that word
[1:18:43] it'd shape a different way it have a
[1:18:45] different pattern on the inside
[1:18:47] so it can go in it might go in 99 or
[1:18:50] non-tense
[1:18:52] but a key is only activated when it goes
[1:18:54] all the way in
[1:18:56] they calibrate peace out so i'm trying
[1:18:58] to open a door no no no no you'll break
[1:19:00] a key
[1:19:01] and plenty of people are going to break
[1:19:03] their key upon christ's door in this
[1:19:04] hour
[1:19:05] because he ain't made for that but your
[1:19:08] key
[1:19:08] is a divine revelation from god
[1:19:12] hallelujah a supernatural experience
[1:19:15] which gives you
[1:19:16] faith a perfect faith to open that door
[1:19:23] [Applause]
[1:19:25] oh hallelujah somebody praise him this
[1:19:28] morning
[1:19:29] oh man
[1:19:35] all right whenever your long time is
[1:19:37] going
[1:19:39] mercy i don't know press on
[1:19:42] all right here it is okay so the bible
[1:19:45] teaches it he said i hold a key
[1:19:46] fit in my hand or my heart that says
[1:19:48] that's god's word he said that will
[1:19:50] quench the violence of fire
[1:19:51] he said let's unlock the healing for the
[1:19:53] sick
[1:19:55] it'll unlock salvation to the loss he
[1:19:57] said i've come to the door everything in
[1:19:58] his name
[1:19:59] whatever you do in word or d do it all
[1:20:01] in his name
[1:20:03] knowing that the key that you got is
[1:20:05] fate
[1:20:06] because it's a scripture made key
[1:20:09] he said now if it says creed key
[1:20:10] denominational key i don't know what
[1:20:12] it'll do
[1:20:12] but if it's a scriptural key it'll
[1:20:14] unlock because god said so
[1:20:17] oh thank god we received a scriptural
[1:20:19] key
[1:20:20] oh aki according to his word according
[1:20:23] to what he promised would take place
[1:20:25] that's the key we're holding this
[1:20:27] morning by faith isn't that right
[1:20:29] hallelujah no wonder they can subdivide
[1:20:31] so far amen they had the key okay
[1:20:33] he said first none of those prophets
[1:20:34] nothing could stop them he didn't have
[1:20:36] to do
[1:20:37] the prophet said he's testifying he
[1:20:38] didn't have to do like he does to me
[1:20:40] sometimes
[1:20:41] pounding it over and over and perhaps i
[1:20:43] hope not
[1:20:44] but he keep telling me go do this he
[1:20:46] said and then he'll stumble along
[1:20:48] then go do this go back and do it again
[1:20:50] he didn't do it
[1:20:51] right he said just one little knot
[1:20:54] just and they feel the spirit just tell
[1:20:56] them it's the thing to do
[1:20:58] and nothing's going to stop them oh
[1:21:01] fearless at the job isn't that right
[1:21:03] because they got in contact with
[1:21:04] something oh brother they stopped them
[1:21:06] out of lines they escaped the edge of
[1:21:07] the sword
[1:21:08] they done everything just a little not
[1:21:09] from god because they held the key in
[1:21:11] their hand
[1:21:12] that great faith he says oh hallelujah
[1:21:15] oh my how glorious he says
[1:21:17] he said now you know a key unlocks watch
[1:21:19] he said no now you know
[1:21:21] a key that locks unlocks too
[1:21:25] see he said you can loosen or bind
[1:21:29] the word says so isn't that right we
[1:21:30] just read it the same key that locks
[1:21:32] unlocks and the key that unlocks can
[1:21:35] lock up
[1:21:39] oh that's exactly see said because it
[1:21:42] works both ways
[1:21:44] and he said how pitiful it is that the
[1:21:46] church has ever
[1:21:47] lost its vision of that he said what a
[1:21:50] sad
[1:21:50] thing it was when the church sold itself
[1:21:53] out to creeds
[1:21:55] as we've done today and now trying to
[1:21:58] call to unite
[1:21:59] oh isn't that right it reminds you of
[1:22:01] samson
[1:22:02] when he sold himself out to delilah oh
[1:22:05] isn't that right
[1:22:06] hello is it to that spirit he was tied
[1:22:08] to those seven locks
[1:22:10] god tied it to him because when he lost
[1:22:12] it he lost the power
[1:22:14] and when he got it back he got back the
[1:22:16] power oh isn't that right
[1:22:18] hallelujah that was his covenant that
[1:22:20] was his key
[1:22:21] hallelujah to the power of god allah was
[1:22:23] those seven locks
[1:22:25] no wonder the prophet said he has my
[1:22:27] only hope that while samson was in
[1:22:29] prison
[1:22:30] i'm not a shock of here grouch oh
[1:22:33] hallelujah while he was pound
[1:22:35] while he was grinding at the mill
[1:22:37] another shock of air grew out
[1:22:39] and the church might be in a condition
[1:22:41] you might feel like you're in a
[1:22:42] condition
[1:22:43] but i say this morning while you were in
[1:22:46] prison
[1:22:47] another shock of here is growing out
[1:22:50] this morning
[1:22:51] god's getting our group ready holy our
[1:22:54] crop ready
[1:22:55] for that last great kill
[1:22:58] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:01] hallelujah
[1:23:02] there will be a pride on the earth with
[1:23:04] the key to the door
[1:23:06] to unlock the promises of god for this
[1:23:09] day
[1:23:10] the rapture for this day the wedding
[1:23:12] supper for this day
[1:23:14] hallelujah millennium everything praise
[1:23:16] this behind that door
[1:23:18] let's go to that door this morning let's
[1:23:20] leave this world behind
[1:23:21] it don't make sense sticking around here
[1:23:23] anymore everything is falling apart
[1:23:25] the world is falling apart the systems
[1:23:27] are falling apart
[1:23:28] everything you think is permanent it's
[1:23:30] only temporary but there's one thing
[1:23:32] that will remain
[1:23:33] when heaven and earth pass away that
[1:23:35] word will never pass away
[1:23:37] and that word shall accomplish that word
[1:23:40] is gonna turn to spirit
[1:23:41] in your life in your heart oh hallelujah
[1:23:44] are you gonna be a witness
[1:23:46] of this glorious resurrection ministry

[1:23:58] go we've seen
[1:23:59] where the great roman hierarchy they
[1:24:01] have come they're going now

[1:24:04] programs they said i thought they didn't
[1:24:05] change what they're going to anyhow
[1:24:07] give each priest the power of a pope
[1:24:09] wherever he's at and so forth how
[1:24:10] pitiful that the church ever sold out to
[1:24:12] dogmas
[1:24:13] instead of the word see that's where
[1:24:16] they left the key right there
[1:24:18] that's the reason here's the prophet
[1:24:20] said these great miracles
[1:24:22] and signs are not done amongst the
[1:24:24] people today
[1:24:26] that there used to be because they've

[1:24:50] those tools oh you've got faith the
[1:24:53] little remnant here this morning

[1:26:12] treasures are behind the door

[1:29:27] the revelation of jesus christ today
[1:29:30] but on exactly the revelation jesus
[1:29:32] christ and through the new birth
[1:29:34] you're born again hallelujah he is born
[1:29:37] in there
[1:29:38] and he christ injects his own life
[1:29:43] to your new birth that's why you must be
[1:29:45] born again
[1:29:47] oh you're going to receive it you've got
[1:29:49] to receive it
[1:29:50] it's the only way for him to inject his
[1:29:51] life in there
[1:29:54] and begin to grow in you from faith to
[1:29:56] faith to faith
[1:29:59] hallelujah uma do you believe it
[1:30:02] he's born in there and he checks his own
[1:30:04] life your life is gone and the life of
[1:30:06] christ is projecting itself through you
[1:30:09] with the preeminences to the people that
[1:30:11] they see the very life on works and
[1:30:13] signs
[1:30:13] and wonders that he did is doing the
[1:30:16] same thing through
[1:30:17] you so we got to see
[1:30:20] as we come near the headstone i remember
[1:30:22] the stephen oliveira
[1:30:23] man he preached our message supercharged
[1:30:25] super race isn't that right
[1:30:26] what a blessing and as we narrow that
[1:30:28] headstone we've got to see these
[1:30:30] signs and wonders be in fulfilled god
[1:30:33] being manifest in us
[1:30:35] oh we're nowhere close to it he's coming
[1:30:37] for our perfect church
[1:30:39] he's coming for our church with jesus
[1:30:40] christ walking in it
[1:30:45] so these signs have to follow them i
[1:30:47] believe oh
[1:30:48] hello then we're going to see the sick
[1:30:50] being healed the blind seeing the
[1:30:52] walking
[1:30:53] the gospel being preaching his power
[1:30:56] when that time comes
[1:30:58] oh holy satan this mountain be moved and
[1:31:00] don't you doubt in your heart
[1:31:02] but faith to believe it fatal move
[1:31:04] mountains
[1:31:05] a perfect page for a perfect rapture
[1:31:12] hallelujah see the very life and signs
[1:31:15] those are right that is looking through
[1:31:16] you
[1:31:17] outside of that the rest is not even
[1:31:18] called to at all now watch god's great
[1:31:20] revelation unfolding he said
[1:31:23] now by lack of this revelation is why we
[1:31:26] have so many different divisions among
[1:31:27] us
[1:31:28] and so much mockery so much division
[1:31:31] among us is because
[1:31:32] the people lack that revelation see
[1:31:36] they lack that revelation the teachers
[1:31:39] oh my but to the church the bride the
[1:31:42] rapture is a revelation to her
[1:31:44] it is revealed to her that the
[1:31:47] revelation the true bride of christ
[1:31:49] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:31:52] the rapture
[1:31:53] amen so what is fate it's a revelation
[1:31:56] a revelation to you holy this word is
[1:32:00] revealed to you
[1:32:02] who god is what he is and what he's
[1:32:05] about to do in you
[1:32:09] he said and now it's a revelation for
[1:32:11] the revelation
[1:32:12] is faith what is it it's faith
[1:32:16] the revelation is faith you cannot have
[1:32:19] a revelation he said
[1:32:20] without it being faith faith
[1:32:24] is a revelation oh hallelujah
[1:32:28] and that is the key to the door because
[1:32:31] it's something that's revealed to you
[1:32:34] like it was to abraham that could call
[1:32:36] anything contrary to what's been
[1:32:37] revealed to him
[1:32:38] and though it wasn't so now what he said
[1:32:40] now faith uh
[1:32:42] what faith is is a revelation of god the
[1:32:44] church is built upon a revelation the
[1:32:46] whole
[1:32:47] entire body amen amen hallelujah glory
[1:32:51] to god honestly isn't that right
[1:32:53] he said now and uh uh revelation jesus
[1:32:56] christ exposition
[1:32:57] he said now let me show you another
[1:32:58] reason why satan hates this book of
[1:33:01] revelation of jesus christ
[1:33:02] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:33:04] yesterday today and forever
[1:33:06] and he changes not he knows that a whole
[1:33:08] lot more than 99 percent of delusions
[1:33:11] oh a lot of people who think they know
[1:33:14] but to know him
[1:33:15] is life he is the living word hola he
[1:33:18] gives he is the life giver
[1:33:20] to the scriptures hallelujah not we
[1:33:22] ourselves
[1:33:23] but he will he reveal himself to isn't
[1:33:26] that right
[1:33:27] holiday he bypassed the learning he
[1:33:29] bypassed the schools
[1:33:30] he bypassed the theology but one time he
[1:33:33] had a woman to meet
[1:33:34] he told the disciples go and get some
[1:33:36] meat for yourselves but there's somebody
[1:33:38] i got to speak to
[1:33:39] there's somebody i've got to meet hello
[1:33:42] she was an ill-famed woman
[1:33:44] but jesus had an appointment to speak to
[1:33:46] this woman
[1:33:48] because this woman had a representation
[1:33:50] in her
[1:33:54] hallelujah this woman is living all kind
[1:33:56] of life
[1:33:57] and it's just perfect because it proves
[1:34:00] to show that it doesn't matter what
[1:34:01] condition you are in
[1:34:03] doesn't matter what situation you are in
[1:34:06] on earth
[1:34:07] once that seed is in your soul when
[1:34:09] jesus
[1:34:10] comes to you when the life giver
[1:34:14] comes to his own word he brings his own
[1:34:16] word to life
[1:34:18] he brings his own word to pass oh he
[1:34:21] shows himself
[1:34:22] he reveals himself
[1:34:29] isn't that right you say woman do you
[1:34:31] have a drink uh
[1:34:32] uh give me a drink isn't that right
[1:34:35] hallelujah
[1:34:36] he said she said uh you know i have
[1:34:38] nothing to get the water with him isn't
[1:34:39] that right and he got to talk and so on
[1:34:41] he began to hunt a spirit he may be
[1:34:43] gonna hunt a soul he began to
[1:34:44] go past the bone in the marrow and the
[1:34:46] discern and thoughts and intent of her
[1:34:48] heart
[1:34:49] to see that she wasn't an ill pain woman
[1:34:51] after all
[1:34:52] that she wasn't so garmed up after all
[1:34:55] that she wasn't so
[1:34:56] lost after all and i don't care how you

[1:35:10] situation
[1:35:11] is not too lost that it cannot be found
[1:35:14] it's not too fallen and it cannot be
[1:35:16] saved
[1:35:16] you are not too broken that he cannot
[1:35:19] put you back together again
[1:35:22] oh let him speak to you this morning
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:40] hallelujah isn't that right oh my
[1:35:44] so he revealed himself to her by pastor
[1:35:47] learning
[1:35:48] hallelujah pharisees sadducees of that
[1:35:50] day
[1:35:51] said our fathers ate bread and
[1:35:52] willingness and he said they're everyone
[1:35:54] dead praise god because they had no
[1:35:56] representation
[1:35:58] because even though the living word is
[1:35:59] standing here right in front of him they
[1:36:00] couldn't recognize it
[1:36:02] oh hallelujah but to babe such as would
[1:36:04] learn

[1:36:21] doing as a feeling
[1:36:23] but somehow another god found him

[1:37:11] when god told moses i will harden
[1:37:13] pharaoh's heart
[1:37:14] against the children of israel and
[1:37:16] against you
[1:37:17] and against all your signs and wonders
[1:37:20] it always amazed me
[1:37:21] how god said i'll harden his heart
[1:37:23] against him so that he'll keep
[1:37:25] going keep going until we get down to
[1:37:27] that last plague
[1:37:28] then i'll break him for him to let you
[1:37:30] loose oh hallelujah i always say that if
[1:37:33] god did harden hats
[1:37:35] he could soften hearts too if god could
[1:37:37] harden hearts
[1:37:39] he could break hearts too he could break
[1:37:42] the hands of fetters
[1:37:43] that bang you he could break this
[1:37:45] painfulness of sin
[1:37:47] he can crush the unbelief he non-belief
[1:37:50] cannot hand a car
[1:37:53] somebody say man
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:15] he stirred up the heart of the king of
[1:38:17] cyrus
[1:38:18] to send the people back to their
[1:38:20] homeland he did that
[1:38:23] he put it on the king's heart oh
[1:38:25] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:38:27] he could put it upon your heart this
[1:38:28] morning he could wake you up
[1:38:30] he could show you something in the world
[1:38:32] this morning he can anoint you
[1:38:34] he could inspire this word to you
[1:38:37] because if this word is inspired to you
[1:38:39] brother you could ask what you will and
[1:38:41] it shall be done unto you why because
[1:38:44] you've got the key
[1:38:45] that opens the door to every promise of
[1:38:48] god
[1:38:49] [Applause]
[1:38:50] promise for your healing promise for
[1:38:52] deliverance
[1:38:53] promise of the holy ghost promise for
[1:38:55] your breakthrough promise for what
[1:38:57] you're looking for
[1:38:58] oh the desire of your heart oh he knows
[1:39:01] the desire of your heart this morning
[1:39:03] he knows what you have need of he is
[1:39:05] able to provide
[1:39:07] your every need he is the door
[1:39:10] every blessing is behind the door all
[1:39:13] you need is a key
[1:39:14] to open that door this morning if any
[1:39:17] man lack wisdom
[1:39:19] let him ask god oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:22] somebody praise him this morning
[1:39:25] glory to god hallelujah
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:32] he knows that since god is immutable
[1:39:34] isn't nature he's just as immutable in
[1:39:36] his ways
[1:39:38] that satan knows surely that the
[1:39:39] original church at pentecost
[1:39:41] the original church the original
[1:39:44] manuscript
[1:39:46] is that right the original whatever you
[1:39:47] want to call it the blueprint
[1:39:50] with the power of god saint mark 16
[1:39:52] action is the true church
[1:39:54] that jesus christ claims as his own
[1:39:57] all else is false it has to be
[1:40:00] amen he said now remember this the
[1:40:03] christ in the true church is a
[1:40:04] continuation of the book of acts we've
[1:40:05] read it
[1:40:06] we know it but praise god i want you to
[1:40:08] shout on it because it's the word of god
[1:40:10] amen hallelujah but the book of
[1:40:11] revelation shows how that antichrist
[1:40:14] spirit will come into the church
[1:40:15] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[1:40:17] powerless
[1:40:18] no praise demons pact in there no faith
[1:40:22] they can't praise they can't believe god
[1:40:23] for our to take
[1:40:25] even hardly much more for the rapture
[1:40:27] isn't that right
[1:40:28] he said but it exposes satan revealing
[1:40:31] his works
[1:40:32] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:40:33] and so on right down to the time he's
[1:40:35] cast in a lake of fire
[1:40:37] the devil fights that
[1:40:41] he fights that he's fighting you this
[1:40:44] morning
[1:40:45] he doesn't want you to get the victory
[1:40:47] because if you get the victory
[1:40:49] you'll kick him in his face faith in the
[1:40:52] word of god
[1:40:53] will unlock every promise to you this
[1:40:55] morning
[1:40:57] oh so his mission is to sit on your lip
[1:41:01] and sit on your hand until you're not
[1:41:03] worried and you can't praise god
[1:41:05] and look what you do yesterday i look
[1:41:07] what you do just now i look at your
[1:41:09] temper
[1:41:09] look at your bad attitude don't look at
[1:41:11] that this morning

[1:41:15] to become
[1:41:16] second peter 1 4-7 oh hallelujah
[1:41:20] hallelujah
[1:41:21] i'm not what i ought to be but i'm not
[1:41:23] what i used to be
[1:41:24] i'm coming on to perfection devil he
[1:41:27] will perfect the word
[1:41:29] that concerned me this morning
[1:41:32] he will complete it he is able to
[1:41:34] complete it
[1:41:36] amen anymore glory
[1:41:39] glory he can't stand it
[1:41:43] he fights that he knows that if the
[1:41:45] people get
[1:41:47] the true revelation of the true church
[1:41:50] and what she is also one day you're
[1:41:53] gonna know
[1:41:54] what it is the genuine thing you're
[1:41:56] gonna be able to taste the real
[1:41:58] thing and all these showers and
[1:42:00] sprinkles of blessings
[1:42:02] was only coming on to something but
[1:42:03] we're coming on to the real thing
[1:42:06] real genuine holy spirit christ directed
[1:42:10] works
[1:42:11] on the third pull third phase hallelujah
[1:42:14] praise khan
[1:42:16] my what she stands for
[1:42:19] and to know that she can do the greater
[1:42:21] works oh hallelujah
[1:42:23] eternal life i'll give you your two boys
[1:42:25] isn't that right
[1:42:26] she'll be an invincible army if they get
[1:42:29] a true
[1:42:30] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:42:33] framework of the christian church and by
[1:42:34] god's spirit
[1:42:35] discern and withstand
[1:42:38] oh hallelujah you're gonna know
[1:42:40] hallelujah every spirit
[1:42:42] what can attend the church by the way
[1:42:44] isn't that right oh hallelujah
[1:42:45] understanding withstand that antichrist
[1:42:47] spirit
[1:42:47] satan will be powerless before isn't
[1:42:50] that right with true revelation it gets
[1:42:52] if i can't prevail all right
[1:42:53] right good skipping on he said now
[1:42:55] you'll recall i mentioned at the
[1:42:56] beginning of this message
[1:42:57] this book we're studying is the actual
[1:42:59] revelation of jesus himself
[1:43:01] in the church as his work in the future
[1:43:04] ages
[1:43:05] then i mentioned that watch now he said
[1:43:07] that it takes the holy spirit
[1:43:09] to give us revelation or we will fail to
[1:43:13] get it
[1:43:14] bringing these two thoughts together now
[1:43:16] you'll see that it won't just take
[1:43:18] ordinary study
[1:43:20] and thinking to make this book real it's
[1:43:22] going to take the operation
[1:43:24] of the holy ghost i said and that means
[1:43:26] that this
[1:43:27] book can't be revealed to anyone but
[1:43:30] a special class of people
[1:43:33] oh here's a shout don't miss it
[1:43:36] hallelujah praise god this book will
[1:43:38] be revealed to a special class of people
[1:43:42] you are not ordinary this morning
[1:43:44] there's something very different about
[1:43:45] you
[1:43:46] that's why the devil tried to kill some
[1:43:48] of you he tried to cut you off
[1:43:50] he's not playing games if he could cut
[1:43:52] you off he would cut you off
[1:43:54] but the angel of the lord and camp it
[1:43:57] round about them that
[1:43:58] fear him and deliver at them god put his
[1:44:02] fear in you
[1:44:03] to recognize the word of god for your
[1:44:05] day
[1:44:06] oh and he protects that god himself
[1:44:11] is fighting against the devil fighting
[1:44:13] against you
[1:44:14] from coming again to this word two
[1:44:16] forces pulling
[1:44:17] one pulling upward one pulling downward

[1:45:50] right it's going to be the operation of
[1:45:51] the holy ghost a special class of people

[1:50:05] such as prevailing power as a revelation
[1:50:07] of the word
[1:50:08] see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced
[1:50:10] on those who give special attention to
[1:50:12] this book
[1:50:14] and i think this refers to the old
[1:50:15] testament custom of the priest and so on
[1:50:17] reading the word to the congregation in
[1:50:18] the morning you see many could read
[1:50:20] so the priests had to read to them and
[1:50:22] as long as it was the word the blessing
[1:50:24] was there
[1:50:25] praise god hell it doesn't matter how
[1:50:26] lonely you are praise god how much phd
[1:50:29] or ll you have is that right praise god
[1:50:31] but god revealed

[1:55:40] that's what the reason is today that the
[1:55:41] revivals that we're supposed to have
[1:55:43] third seal he said we had denomination
[1:55:45] revivals
[1:55:46] he said we've had a real stirring we
[1:55:49] haven't had a real stirring
[1:55:50] no no no no no sir don't think we've got
[1:55:52] revivals we haven't
[1:55:53] oh they've got millions and millions of
[1:55:55] church members
[1:55:57] but not a revival nowhere oh there's
[1:56:00] churches and churches
[1:56:01] there's prides and brides there's groups
[1:56:03] and groups but not a revival nowhere
[1:56:05] this morning
[1:56:06] hear what the prophet said the bride
[1:56:08] hasn't had a revival yet
[1:56:10] see there's been no man revival there no
[1:56:13] manifestation of god to stir
[1:56:16] the bride yet oh hallelujah so this
[1:56:19] revival that we're looking for
[1:56:21] has to come by a manifestation of god
[1:56:24] to stir the pride to discreet revival to
[1:56:27] start this great revival that we're
[1:56:28] looking for
[1:56:29] oh see but we're looking for it now and
[1:56:32] here it is he said it'll take those
[1:56:34] seven
[1:56:34] unknown thunders back there to wake her
[1:56:38] up again
[1:56:40] oh see he said yeah he'll sell it he
[1:56:43] he promised it oh he said now watch
[1:56:46] first seal prophet said at the end of
[1:56:47] the pentecostal age
[1:56:49] we're supposed to receive according to
[1:56:50] the word of god and god help me tonight
[1:56:52] to show you through here
[1:56:54] that we are to see and receive a
[1:56:55] messenger that will take those loose
[1:56:58] ends out there and reveal the whole
[1:56:59] secret of god for the rapturing of the
[1:57:02] church
[1:57:02] he said and then there's coming forth
[1:57:04] seven mysterious thunders
[1:57:06] that's not even written at all that's
[1:57:08] right and i believe that
[1:57:10] through those seven thunders will be
[1:57:12] revealed in the last days in order to
[1:57:14] get the bride together
[1:57:15] for rapturing fate he said because what
[1:57:18] we
[1:57:19] got now we wouldn't be able to do it
[1:57:22] oh hallelujah he said we can't have
[1:57:24] enough faith for divine healing
[1:57:26] and we've got to have enough faithful to
[1:57:27] be changed in a moment
[1:57:29] and to be swept out of this earth we
[1:57:32] gotta have enough faith for that this
[1:57:33] morning friends
[1:57:35] oh hallelujah you can't do that in your
[1:57:37] human spirit
[1:57:38] you can't do that in your human self but
[1:57:40] it'll take a power
[1:57:42] to take the church up into glory this
[1:57:45] morning
[1:57:46] oh that's what we're looking for that's
[1:57:48] what we under

[1:58:15] fourth seal
[1:58:16] and we found out that he gets killed
[1:58:17] with the sword too the sword of the word
[1:58:19] of god of god's word what is it
[1:58:21] sharp sharp two-edged sword
[1:58:24] slays him puts him right down private
[1:58:26] said wait
[1:58:27] till them seven on those on uh seven
[1:58:30] thunders i'll tell their voices to
[1:58:31] that group who can really take the word
[1:58:34] of god and hand it there
[1:58:35] it'll slice and cut oh and they'll close
[1:58:38] the heavens
[1:58:39] they can shut this they can do that or
[1:58:42] whatever they want to
[1:58:44] oh glory he said he'll be slayed by the
[1:58:47] word that proceeds from his mouth
[1:58:50] sharper than any two-edged sword oh what
[1:58:53] are we saying this morning it'll take
[1:58:55] that prophecy
[1:58:56] to unlock the heavens this day in this
[1:58:59] hour
[1:58:59] in the season the dynamics revival that
[1:59:02] we are looking for
[1:59:03] it will take malachi 4's prophecy oh
[1:59:06] you've got to know it by revelation
[1:59:09] in order to speak it in order to anoint
[1:59:12] it
[1:59:12] in order to take that key and turn it in
[1:59:15] the door
[1:59:16] which is christ revealed for this last
[1:59:20] day
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:22] right now everybody have to do it
[1:59:24] everybody preaching the door malachi 4
[1:59:26] word isn't that right
[1:59:27] but it'll take those seven unknown
[1:59:29] thunders to get
[1:59:30] access to this power of god that we're
[1:59:33] looking for
[1:59:34] to heal the sick to see the lame walk to
[1:59:37] see the cripples walk
[1:59:38] to see the gospel preaching his power
[1:59:41] it'll take the key
[1:59:42] to the door to unlock every promise
[1:59:45] that is laying in malachi 4's message
[1:59:48] [Applause]
[1:59:52] almost home now almost home hallelujah
[1:59:54] oh hello we're running
[1:59:56] so he'll be asleep by that word isn't
[1:59:58] that right it's the word of god coming
[1:59:59] from the mouth of god yes
[2:00:00] and he always uses man to work with oh
[2:00:04] isn't that right no wonder in this last
[2:00:06] day the prophet said he's calling god
[2:00:08] call man
[2:00:09] man that's not trained by the school of
[2:00:10] theology but train
[2:00:12] in the spirit of god you know the spirit
[2:00:16] of god
[2:00:17] the little prophet said i'm identified
[2:00:19] with a group
[2:00:20] that feels the spirit of god that knows
[2:00:23] that he is the same yesterday
[2:00:25] that he is ashamed today that he is the
[2:00:27] same forever
[2:00:28] i didn't come to warm a church bench but
[2:00:30] i know the spot i want to know the
[2:00:32] spirit of god
[2:00:34] i want to be trained on that anointing
[2:00:36] train on that holy spirit of promise
[2:00:38] i want to be so yielded that i could
[2:00:41] feel him move
[2:00:42] and i could move with it the spirit
[2:00:45] hallelujah
[2:00:46] appearing witness that we are the chosen
[2:00:49] of god this morning
[2:00:54] because if you're dead he'll pass right
[2:00:56] over you
[2:01:02] god didn't come for dead bride you know
[2:01:04] can you imagine a man is causing a woman
[2:01:06] and he's telling her you know i'm gonna
[2:01:07] come back for you i love you so much
[2:01:09] you know i'll do anything for you i'll
[2:01:11] give you the moon and the stars and
[2:01:12] she's like huh

[2:01:20] what does he do he goes away
[2:01:24] there's no engagement hallelujah isn't
[2:01:26] that right but when you speak to her
[2:01:28] and she responds back and she believe
[2:01:30] him
[2:01:31] and they enter the conversation then it
[2:01:33] reforms a relationship
[2:01:35] because they have like interests they
[2:01:37] have like passions
[2:01:38] they bought one the word they would want
[2:01:41] to see it reveal
[2:01:42] oh hallelujah then he gets excited as he
[2:01:44] shares the word and as he brings her
[2:01:46] closer to him
[2:01:47] they become one they develop a
[2:01:49] relationship and god wants to become one
[2:01:51] with you this morning
[2:01:52] not by might not by power but by his
[2:01:55] spirit
