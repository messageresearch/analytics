[0:00] But I don't know if YOU'LL HEAL ME.
[0:01] STAND UP AND LET THAT WORD BECOME YOUR
[0:05] WORD. WELL, I BELIEVE GOD CAN DELIVER,
[0:07] BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN. STAND UP AND
[0:10] LET THAT WORD BECOME YOUR WORD. WELL, I
[0:13] DON'T THINK GOD CAN GIVE ME THE POWER TO
[0:14] OVERCOME. STAND UP AND LET THAT WORD
[0:18] BECOME YOUR COME ON. CAN I TELL YOU WHAT
[0:20] THAT WORD IS? IT IS FINISHED.
[0:24] [cheering]
[0:24] LET THAT WORD BECOME YOUR WORD. LET THAT
[0:28] WORD BECOME YOUR CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH,
[0:30] [screaming]
[0:31] PASTOR. LET THAT WORD BECOME YOUR
[0:33] TESTIMONY. LET THAT [laughter] WORD
[0:36] BECOME YOUR DECLARATION OF FAITH AND
[0:38] WATCH THE DEVILS OF HELL BEGIN TO BACK
[0:40] UP. WATCH THE DEMONS OF HELL BEGIN TO
[0:43] TURN LOOSE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A
[0:45] BUNCH OF LAZY CHRISTIANS. I'M TALKING
[0:47] ABOUT SOME EAGLES. I'M TALKING ABOUT
[0:49] SOME SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[0:51] [cheering and applause]
[0:55] LISTEN, can I tell you something? It is
[0:58] finished.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? WHEN JESUS STOOD
[1:02] THERE AND HE HUNG BETWEEN THE HEAVENS
[1:04] AND THE EARTH AND HE CRIED THOSE WORDS,
[1:06] "IT is finished."
[1:09] &gt;&gt; You ever looked at that word finished,
[1:11] complete,
[1:13] &gt;&gt; final,
[1:14] &gt;&gt; paid for.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; I love this one. Over.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Done.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Ended. Complete. [cheering]
[1:25] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S OVER. IT'S ENDED. IT'S
[1:32] FINISHED.
[1:33] [applause]
[1:35] &gt;&gt; It's complete. CAN I SAY IT TO YOU
[1:37] TODAY? LISTEN. WHEN JESUS HUNG THERE AND
[1:39] DIED, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE DIDN'T
[1:41] SAY CANCER'S finished
[1:44] &gt;&gt; because that would be the only thing.
[1:50] He didn't say DEPRESSION WAS FINISHED
[1:53] CUZ THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT
[1:54] WAS FINISHED. HE DIDN'T SAY ANXIETY OR
[1:57] NERVOUSNESS. HE HE DIDN'T SAY
[1:59] PORNOGRAPHY.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T SAY DRUGS. HE DIDN'T SAY
[2:03] HABITS OR ADDICTIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT HE
[2:05] SAID? HE SAID IT. [cheering]
[2:08] [applause]
[2:09] Whatever it is,
[2:12] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A PART TO DO. HIS PART.
[2:15] [screaming]
[2:16] HALLELUJAH. HIS PART WAS TO FINISH IT.
[2:19] BUT YOUR PART IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS
[2:22] FINISHED.
[2:24] HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "IS THE WILL OF GOD
[2:27] TO HEAL ME? BY MY STRIPES, I AM HEALED."
[2:31] IS IT THE WILL OF GOD TO SAVE ME? THIS
[2:33] GOSPEL IS FOR THOSE WHO THE LORD SHALL
[2:35] CALL.
[2:37] Come on, I'M PREACHING TO YOU. IT'S TIME
[2:39] TO GET UP AND STAND ON THE WORD OF GOD
[2:42] AND ROLL THE STONE AWAY. [cheering]
[2:47] TELL THAT DEVIL RIGHT NOW, NERVOUSNESS
[2:49] IS FINISHED. Unbelief is finished.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THE DEVIL IS HANGING OVER YOUR
[2:57] LIFE, [screaming]
[2:58] DO YOUR PART TODAY. [cheering]
[3:01] [applause]
[3:03] &gt;&gt; It is finished. [cheering]
[3:09] [applause]
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you today? Amen.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; You are the unlimited generation.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; You're not just walking around limited
[3:20] with an intellectual conception,
[3:22] &gt;&gt; but you have been given

[3:26] &gt;&gt; the revealed will of God,
[3:29] &gt;&gt; now. What are you going to do with it?

[3:38] defy that devil.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; I rebuke that devil. [applause] You're
[3:44] not limited.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; You're unlimited.
[3:47] [applause]
[3:49] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what's limiting you is
[3:50] what you're
[3:52] &gt;&gt; This is okay.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what's limiting you is the
[3:55] way you're thinking about God.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; And the way you're thinking about this
[3:59] word,
[4:00] &gt;&gt; you're thinking you got to get it all
[4:01] figured out before it can work for you.
[4:03] And you're thinking you got to be able
[4:04] to cross all the tees and dot all the
[4:06] eyes. YOU KNOW WHAT? MY BIBLE SAID ALL
[4:08] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. [cheering]
[4:11] TO THEM THAT can believe.
[4:15] If you can believe it, [cheering]
[4:19] if you can BELIEVE IT, THEN YOU'VE GOT A
[4:22] RIGHT TO POSSESS IT. COME ON, CHURCH.
[4:24] YOU'RE UNLIMITED. COME ON. THE DEVIL IS
[4:27] LIMITED. BUT OUR GOD IS UNLIMITED. HE'S
[4:31] GOT UNLIMITED POWER. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED
[4:34] MERCY. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED GRACE. HE'S
[4:36] GOT UNLIMITED REVELATION. LISTEN, THERE
[4:39] IS AN UNLIMITED REVIVAL. THERE IS
[4:41] UNLIMITED JOY. THERE IS UNLIMITED
[4:44] ANOINTING. THERE IS UNLIMITED AUTHORITY.
[4:47] THERE IS UNLIMITED REALITIES OF THE
[4:49] NEVER FAILING PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[4:55] You're unlimited.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; You're unlimited. Let me say this to you
[4:59] today as the musicians come. You're
[5:01] unlimited.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Tradition tradition will limit you. But
[5:06] this message will unlimit you.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; The other day I was speaking [snorts] on
[5:12] some thoughts along the lines of
[5:14] limitations. And I was praying and I
[5:17] said, "Lord, here I am speaking to these
[5:19] young people and I'm telling them
[5:21] they're unlimited.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; They're unlimited. You're unlimited in
[5:25] God. You're unlimited in his power.
[5:28] You're you're unlimited in his
[5:30] anointing. You're unlimited in his
[5:32] authority. You're un you're you're
[5:34] you're an unlimited generation.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what? You also have
[5:40] unlimited expectations.
[5:43] [applause]
[5:46] &gt;&gt; There's no limit on the expectations of
[5:48] a son or daughter of God.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Unlimited.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Unlimited. And I got to thinking on that
[5:57] and I was riding down the road and I was
[5:58] just meditating and praying and I said,
[6:00] 'Lord, that young people are unlimited.
[6:03] I said, I'm just praying, Lord, show it
[6:06] to me. Make it more real. And as clear
[6:08] as I'm talking to you, spirit Lord spoke
[6:09] to my heart and said, go tell my young
[6:12] people the only place they're unlimited
[6:14] is in this message.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; And you know how you just start
[6:20] fellowshipping with the Lord? I said,
[6:21] Lord, that's powerful.
[6:24] I said, "Lord, then where are they
[6:25] limited?" And it just come to my heart
[6:27] so clearly. Do you realize in sports
[6:29] you're limited?
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Do you realize you can start out as a
[6:34] kid playing and you can climb all the
[6:36] way up to the top and you can reach the
[6:38] majors
[6:40] &gt;&gt; or whatever they have here, the the
[6:41] highest league,
[6:43] &gt;&gt; and you're limited. You can't go no
[6:45] further.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; You're capped off,
[6:48] &gt;&gt; finished. Done.
[6:50] I said, "Lord, where else?" Spirit of
[6:53] the Lord brought it to my heart.
[6:54] Education,
[6:56] &gt;&gt; not preaching against education. I
[6:57] believe in it in its place.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[7:02] &gt;&gt; But do you realize you can start off in
[7:03] grade school and climb all the way to
[7:05] the highest degree you can get in
[7:07] college and you can't go no further?
[7:11] &gt;&gt; But in this message,
[7:14] [applause and cheering]
[7:15] &gt;&gt; IN THIS MESSAGE, THERE'S NO LIMIT.
[7:20] THERE'S NO LIMIT.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO.
[7:25] THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHERE YOU CAN GO.
[7:27] COME ON. YOU SAY, "I CAN ONLY GO SO
[7:29] FAR." NO, YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO
[7:30] HEAVEN. YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO GLORY.
[7:33] YOU'RE NOT JUST CLIMBING UP TO ONE AGE.
[7:35] YOU DIDN'T JUST CLIMB UP TO THE
[7:36] AIRPLANE. YOU DIDN'T JUST CLIMB UP,
[7:38] AMEN, TO THE HORSE AND BUGGY. YOU CAN
[7:40] CLIMB ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE REALMS OF
[7:42] THE ETERNITIES of God.

[7:48] YOUR FAITH. RELEASE YOUR FAITH IN THIS
[7:50] PROMISED word of God. Stand on your feet
[7:53] with us today. [cheering]

[8:08] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; Don't reason it.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[8:16] You said, "But Andrew, what are you
[8:17] getting at?" I'll tell you exactly what
[8:18] I'm getting at. There is a people on the
[8:20] earth today who has not rejected the
[8:24] revealed will of God.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; But they have received the revealed will
[8:28] of God.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; And today there is an authority in this
[8:31] building. There is a power right here in
[8:34] this building today
[8:35] &gt;&gt; that every young man, every young woman,
[8:38] every man, every woman can be delivered
[8:41] today
[8:43] &gt;&gt; by the will of God. Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; We know the will of God.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we're here to do the will of God.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; How many say, "Lord, today I want to
[8:51] do."
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; I want to carry out your plan.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; I want to carry out your will.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's not my will,
[9:01] &gt;&gt; but thy will be done.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want today I want to lay my life
[9:06] on the altar.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to self-sacrifice.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; I want to sacrifice my ideas today,
[9:13] Lord.
[9:14] I want to sacrifice the new cart. I want
[9:16] to lay it on the altar. I'm tired of
[9:18] trying to live live this message on the
[9:20] new cart. [music]
[9:22] I want to come back to God's ordained
[9:23] way.
[9:25] Said, "Brother Andrew, I'm nervous and
[9:27] can't overcome these things and [music]
[9:28] can't overcome it." I tell you, the
[9:30] power of God is in this building today.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of new carts around, but
[9:34] there's only one ordained way,
[9:36] &gt;&gt; and it's the Holy Ghost and fire.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; It'll clean a man up.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; It'll transform a life. I believe right
[9:43] here today, you've been given authority.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; God has done his part.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; God has done his part.
[9:51] God has sent his word.
[9:54] God has revealed the message.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are in the building.
[9:58] The presence of the Holy Spirit is here.
[10:00] God has done his part. Now I say unto
[10:02] you today, will you do your part? Will
[10:05] you roll this stone away
[10:09] with every head bowed eye closed right
[10:10] now? Whatever you're facing, I believe
[10:13] the Holy Ghost is right here in this
[10:14] building today. I believe he's here to
[10:17] roll that stone away.
[10:19] Will you let him do it right now?
[10:22] I believe he's right here to give you
[10:24] the strength to [music] say, "Satan, I'm
[10:26] rolling this stone away. The Holy
[10:28] Spirit, the resurrection is right here
[10:29] in this building. The resurrection is
[10:32] here to call forth these things the
[10:33] enemy has tried to bury in my life.
[10:37] He's here calling you forth.
[10:40] Almighty God in this building today is
[10:43] standing your sons and your daughters.
[10:46] Now, Father, there's one thing I know. I
[10:48] know that we're two or three are
[10:49] gathered together in your name. [music]
[10:52] You made a promise that you would come
[10:54] and you would be in our midst. Now,
[10:57] Lord, I look around and there's more
[10:58] than two or three here today. But Lord,
[11:01] there's a room here full of believers
[11:02] that are believing you. Father, they're
[11:05] ready for that transforming grace and
[11:07] power of your life and your word to come
[11:09] into their heart. Now, Father, I bind
[11:12] the hand of Satan right now that would
[11:14] try to paralyze their faith, that would
[11:16] try to paralyze the anointing of the
[11:18] Holy Spirit. Father, I believe you're
[11:21] right here tonight, this morning, Lord,
[11:22] this evening, rather. I believe you're
[11:24] right here walking the aisles of this
[11:26] building, Lord. Father, we've preached
[11:28] your word today, telling the children of
[11:30] God, you've done your part. Now, Lord,
[11:33] you're not looking [music] for us to
[11:34] figure it out. That's not our part. Our
[11:37] part is not intellectually understanding
[11:39] all these things. Our part is to
[11:42] believe. Our part is to believe what
[11:44] you've done. Our part is to accept it by
[11:47] faith and let it become a revelation to
[11:49] our hearts. Now, Father, if there be one
[11:52] here today that the devil's in a great
[11:54] battle with them, I pray the grace of
[11:56] Almighty God would usher that revelation
[11:58] into their hearts, Lord, that they would
[12:00] see and understand and know who they are
[12:02] in your word. They would know the power
[12:04] that rest upon their lives. Father, I'm
[12:07] asking you today, come by this way,
[12:09] Lord. Father, your word is gone [music]
[12:11] forth now. I pray that shackles and the
[12:14] chains would fall off, oh God. Lord, the
[12:17] demons of hell, the demons of Leodysia,
[12:20] the spirits that are attacking the homes
[12:22] and attacking the [music] mamas and
[12:24] daddies and attacking the children,
[12:26] attacking the family. Father, I stand
[12:28] here today as a voice against it in the
[12:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan,
[12:33] you've come against the world. You've
[12:34] you've claimed homes. You've claimed
[12:36] nations, but there's a little faith
[12:38] woman who's rising to the challenge.
[12:40] HALLELUJAH. WE'RE RISING TO the
[12:43] challenge and we're drawing our sword
[12:44] and we're going to fight for the
[12:46] original structure that the word is
[12:48] given in this hour for a home and for a
[12:50] family. Father, I pray for these young
[12:52] men. Lord, I pray you would baptize them
[12:54] with the Holy Ghost and fire. I pray the
[12:57] realities of Jesus Christ would become
[12:59] their portion today. Father, I pray,
[13:01] Lord, you would give them the courage of
[13:03] Joshua. I pray you would give them the
[13:04] strength of [music] Samson. I pray you
[13:06] would give them the wisdom of Solomon. I
[13:08] pray you would give them the the
[13:09] anointing, [music] oh God, of David.
[13:11] Father, I PRAY YOU WOULD GIVE THEM THE
[13:12] things you would have for them, Lord.
[13:14] Not to just be sissies, not to just be
[13:16] young men led around by Leosa, BUT
[13:19] FATHER, I believe [music] you're calling
[13:20] for real men that are going to become
[13:22] husbands will become fathers. Lord, if
[13:24] you should terry, they'll become the
[13:26] leaders of the church. Lord, you're not
[13:28] looking for compromisers. YOU'RE NOT
[13:30] LOOKING FOR LAZY CHRISTIANS. You're
[13:32] looking for evils that are willing to
[13:34] hunt. They're willing to dig. They're
[13:36] willing to pursue the things of God.
[13:38] Father, I pray for every young lady.
[13:40] Father, may you give her the grace,
[13:41] Lord. May you give her the grace of
[13:43] Sarah. Father, may you give her the
[13:45] grace, Lord, to be a h to to be a Holy
[13:47] Ghost fil lady, to be a Holy Ghost fil
[13:50] daughter of Abraham. Lord, when Leosa is
[13:53] trying to dress our young ladies in
[13:55] Hollywood, it's trying to claim their
[13:57] lives and their bodies for their own
[13:58] fulfillment. I rebuke every devil in the
[14:01] name of Jesus [music] Christ. May the
[14:03] power OF THE HOLY GHOST, may it surround
[14:06] every young lady. May you give her the
[14:08] power to overcome, Lord. May you make
[14:10] her a Holy GHOST FILLED WIFE. MAY YOU
[14:12] make her a Holy Ghost filled mother.
[14:14] Lord, [music] if the time cherry,
[14:15] there'll be the Sunday school teachers.
[14:17] There'll be the there'll be the fifth
[14:18] gospel leading the young people. Oh God,
[14:21] I believe this message has come [music]
[14:23] to restore back people who is doing the
[14:26] will of God, not on the new cart, but in
[14:28] God's [music] ordained way to do it.
[14:31] Father, if there be one here today in
[14:32] the valley of decision, I pray the voice
[14:35] of omnipotence would [music] speak
[14:36] across this service today and may you
[14:39] give them direction, Lord. [music]
[14:42] Father, if they're moving under the
[14:43] inspiration of a man, may they come
[14:44] under the inspiration of [music] your
[14:45] word. Father, if they're viewing this
[14:48] message through the filter of a man, may
[14:50] they lay [music] it aside and take a
[14:51] thinking man's filter. May they lay
[14:54] aside theories, Lord. May they lay aside
[14:57] ideas and traditions and may they lay
[14:59] aside everything to receive you [music]
[15:03] and to receive you fully in the name
[15:05] [music] of Jesus Christ we pray. In the
[15:08] name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[15:12] I [music] wonder if you just raise your
[15:13] hands to him right now. Say, "Father, I
[15:16] believe it. Father, I believe your word.
[15:19] Father, I believe you're calling some
[15:21] children right here today to do your
[15:24] will." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There
[15:26] [music] is power. There is power in the
[15:29] name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
