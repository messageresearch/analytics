this wonderful opportunity to greet brothers and sisters far away from my place from here in germany in a virtual meeting i thank you pastor theo for your kind invitation to let me give a greeting to you also theo it is a very nice topic that you have chosen for this convention the dispensation of another ephesian and it is a continuation of the other conventions that are behind us i want to share a little thought with you all and i hope it helps us to approach a good understanding that we are living in a time of a new dispensation with many promises for this day certainly it is interesting to see that the prophet used two words in this context ephesus and ephesian ephesians on one side we see a person a group of people an ephesian on the other side we see an age called the ephesian age and we understand that this kind of age will be on earth during the days of laodicea we are all familiar with the thought that god has called a bride out of laodicea to live in her bridal age i made a little drawing a slight to express what is in my heart let's look at israel they came out of egypt moses led them but not by himself they was led by the cloud and the pillar of fire joshua took them across the jordan river and had them move into the promised land but the people could not immediately go to their promised land joshua met the captain of the lord there he received a message and through that message israel went into their promise into their land now we see in the days of our lord jesus christ that there were also four steps it speaks of deliverance it started with john the baptist and he said he must increase but i must decrease when this great man jesus christ came on the scene went to calvary crossed the jordan for us and purchased a bride through his shed blood he himself came back and met 120 people with the pillar of freya and isn't it interesting to see that there were 11 of his disciples 11 apostles when this happened then the people had to wait for about 20 years until the 12th apostle could come in and in those days the real emphasis days started but on the other side judgment came upon israel because they were unbelieving the enemy destroyed the temple israel went into the long period of diaspora and the church ages began now the time came for the gentiles to come in if we compare this with what happened in our day we see the same pattern william mary and branham came on earth prepared a way for the lord jesus the son of man to come here and this son of man let us know that the bride of christ will come to her promised land through a third pool now i want to end with a reference to the time in which we live the bride is called out by a loud voice come out from among them she grows as she eats the open book how long will it be before she sees her promise to dine with him at the table we understand that it will be very different from what people think will come in the bible says the lord has created something new and we know after the last predestinated soul will come in into the mystical body of christ there will be a rapture grace will now no longer be available to the gentiles it will go to israel to call out a small group these 144 000 jewish people so we see it is all done through the lord jesus christ this great message is brought to us through the seventh angel through malachi 4. god is doing a hidden but a wonderful thing among his people we are going to a climax of which we never had any idea it is his work the great pillar of fire brought paul in in his day it was god's election not matthew who people thought was the one but this pillar of fire is dealing with his bride right now to bring in the final predestinated soul soon we will gather together not in a virtual space but in a higher place may god bless you all let us stay close to each other let us put aside all our own ideas we know that it is no longer a one-man show god this great person is drawing his bride together to come inside man to manifest himself here on earth as he did in paul's and brother branham's time what a glorious day we have the privilege of living god bless you all and many greetings from the little bride here in germany [Music] human senses can't declare [Music] and [Music] me i must walk alone no one else can't read this [Music] i'm resting on [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh shows me [Applause] preached all that [Music] [Applause] [Music] me is [Music] is [Music] i'm resting on it shows me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] is i'm resting on [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] on i'm rested [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] it's never burning song to worship the lord it always gives me such relief when i think of all my blessings [Music] [Applause] worship the lord [Music] just worship [Music] worship the lord take your burdens to the altar [Music] nail your troubles christ already [Music] take [Music] just worship [Music] what problems so [Music] close your eyes lift your hands and just worship the lord [Music] [Music] just push it [Music] along [Music] ah hallelujah leave the building don't get across this world or we give him praise and give him time how we love him how we are doing he is worthy of one praise he's worthy of god worthy of glory this morning hallelujah thank you jesus thank you for your amazing grace praise the lord this is kampala uganda right now i'm in my house there's a lockdown they're not allowed to go to church the things are terrible the confidential is becoming worse but i thank god that they give god the glory for the privilege and the opportunity that the lord has given me to be to give a testimony to create that virtual confession of it a my precious brother pastor ovid may the lord bless you so much thank you very much for giving me this same occasion my brothers my sisters my fellow ministers all over the world may the good lord bless you mightily uh it is a terrible time the world is going through a kind of emergency and the the whole world is in fear but we thank god uh that after such a time like it is we are not to be afraid because the lord told us in the psalms 46 that he is our refuge the lord is our refuge the lord is the ever-present help in the time of trouble and the name of the lord is a strong tower to which the writers run and is safe so shall we not fear so thank you very much and without wasting time let us read a scripture uh jeremiah 33 because i have only 10 minutes so jeremiah chapter 33 this is what he says verse 3 jeremiah 33 verse 3 he says like it is yeah maya 33 verse 3 he says call unto me this is god speaking to us so in this hour of imagining that we are living in god is calling on us call unto me that is jeremiah 33 verse 3 call unto me and i will answer thee and show the great and mighty things wicked doubt no it's known blessed be the name of the lord so god is calling on us to call on him and then when we got to uh uh in the second column chapter 7 verse 14 this is what god promises chapter 7 second chronicles verse 14 he says if my people a man that are called by my name that's right if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves that is that that is the second chronicles chapter seven the paper the pages are we are not separated and it's a new bible so but i read from here it says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways they will lie here from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land blessed be the name of the lord may the lord add his blessing on the reading of the word father in the mighty name of the lord jesus this is your word thank you for the opportunity to read it and lord god we ask you to speak to us in these closing moments of the times of the gentile blessed brother ovi bless the virtual convention bless my fellow ministers all over the world bless all your children all over the world that are hearing in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray i pray amen and amen in that massive desperation the prophet said talks about a time of emergency there will be a time of emergency upon the bride which will come upon the earth to force us into desperation because god has three things that he uses to get his student into desperation the first thing is the love of god in our hearts pushes us into desperation because we love god and then the second thing that pushes us into desperation he said it's the signs of the times when we see what was prophesied by the prophets in the bible when we see what malachi for prophesied on the tips and the books manifesting coming to pass being fulfilled it it steers up our hearts it gets us on on our it gets us on our toes it wakes us up so the second thing that brings a desperation is is fulfillment of the world that was promised and then the third thing when the children of god are very sourceful and they are procrastinating and they somehow are not getting into the desperation then what god does he has one lastic card he uses and that is bringing a time of emergency upon the world and reverence right now beginning with last year we are seeing a time of emergency upon the earth cities are being locked down entire nations are being locked down businesses are being locked down churches are being locked down uh football uh stadiums where they go for football and other games are all being locked down rather it is so hard it's so terrible when this time of emergency comes in then it wakes up god's children and that's the dusty cat that god wants that that god has according to the message of desperation to wake us up the bride we've had the word we thank god for voice of god we thank god for its partners that are sponsoring it to scatter the message all over the world so we have had the message we have had in the tips we have read the books we have it on the we have the message now on other devices and we know what the message says we thank god for the fight for the ministry over the years they have leveraged to bring what malachi first said to the bride but now the promises and the prophecies for the bride that are in the word oh blessed be the name of the lord need to be manifested and there's no way they can be manifested until we get into desperation that's why in jeremiah chapter 33 verse 3 we see the lord calling on us we that have received the promises we that have the revelation of the prophecies of the hour we who know our inheritance our redemptive rights what god promised the bride in this hour before the rapture must be manifested what god promised the bride before the rapture takes place must be actualized must be manifested must be put on fresh musty come to pass must become a reality must be must become a reality so now we are in a time for the manifestation of what god promises the bride that's the only thing that is keeping off the rapture there has to be a manifestation of what god spoke about the bride and that's why he's calling on us to call on him that's why god is calling on us to call on him he says call unto me and i will hear thee and show you great and mighty things that you didn't know we have the promises but god is waiting for us to call on him for these promises to be manifested it cannot be manifested when we just sit back and relax and take it easy no in the basic desperation brother says until we get to our knees in prayer in intercession and suffocation and call on the name of the lord what god promised cannot be manifested so my brother my sister we have procrastinated a lot we have kept it off for a long time we have been complacent for a long time we've been complacent for a long time we've dragged our feet for a long time we have not taken care about it for a long time but now this is the time that we have to get into desperation we have to call on the lord for the manifestation of every seven thunder prophecy and seven thunder promise that that is that that god gave us through malachi 4 which is on the tapes and the books those promises those prophecies for the bride we are not given to remain on the tips and the books and the bible they must be manifested before the rapture takes place these promises must manifest but they will never be manifested until we call on the lord we go to our knees daily and begin calling on the lord because the time of emergency is upon us calamity after calamity after calamity is striking the earth therefore we have to call on the name of the lord for the manifestation for the bride's promises what we need is the talking the dynamics the creator deity stepping into the perfected adopted bride and that to happen we need to go to our knees in this time of emergency when calamity after calamity is striking the earth we don't have to procrastinate anymore remember only the wise working that are all in the love which is the token which is the dynamics which is the creator deity stepping into the perfected adopted bride are the ones that went so what we now need in this time of emergency is to get this quality all perished but what i'm saying that message inspiration be disparity all perish blessed be the name of the lord he said that we should be desperate all else we are going to punish i'm finished i'm done may the good lord bless you my toy may the lord bless you as we get desperate to leave this place for the holy ghost god bless you thank you very much heaven and
