myself I commit my brothers and sisters into your hand be with us to the exhortation be with us truly prayer Lord for we really need to card onto you Lord to reach to you Lord Father have you with us tonight we ask in the precious name of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ amen amen well praise the Lord we want to turn to the book of Ephesians when I read a scripture from there chapter one [Music] Ephesians chapter 1 and we read from verse 3 read a few verses with the Lord blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are good even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will praise the Lord wanna take another reading from chapter 2 and verse 18 just any page I believe for through him we both have access by one spirit unto their father no therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the whole soul of God and I built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together grid into a holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are builded together for habitation of God to the spirit may God are a blessing to the reading of his wound you may be seated praise the Lord praise the Lord help me tonight you read glory all right please the Lord now let me get a cootie a all right no Bella Bannon says I want to talk a little bit on the adoption but I BAM said what is adoption he said your adoption is not your booth he said your adoption is your place in so he said that we are born we are born by the Spirit of God we are children now when we were born were infants your children if you look at the infantile one could hardly do much he has everything has to be done for him that's how we are born however we born spiritually - we are infants you don't born again today and tomorrow as well I am say you're adopted it's not like that you born and you grow you're mature you are tried you are tested and then you are placed into the body of Christ so it's a process it's something we have to go true he said when Israel crossed the Jordan and entered into the land he said they were all Hebrews they were Hebrews they were born Hebrews they were children of Abraham descendants and all of them they were born that and across the Jordan into this promised land they were already Hebrews but they had to conquer the land and Joshua the leader of the day had to place them in their position in the land every tribe had a portion and every family in every tribe was given a portion of that tribes inheritance so that was the natural type so he said we are born with cheering aboard we say Abba Father hallelujah praise the Lord he say but we can't do much you say we cannot whip the Philistines but we have glory and we have princes and we have shouts we are children aboard he said but we we can do much we can rip the Philistines in so we have to be tried and tested and trained and put into the body of Christ that God could drive the enemy oak know that's the purpose of it God gave the earth to man he gave it to Adam and Adam was to bring 40 other sons of God and the earth was man's even today the scripture says that the whole creation is crying and groaning the looking forward to the manifestation of the sons of God the earth the very earth is crying for his master and to come back to his position to rule the earth the creation itself is groaning for that Abraham said who are these people everybody claiming to be these people did this religion and I will everybody claiming to be the sons of God but then God will manifest put his sons up he will place them in his body he will give them and they will comfort now but I'm saying they wouldn't even have to say anything it will speak for itself the winner you and I become a say well I'm a manifested son he said it will speak for itself but abarim once walked into a meeting and he didn't pray he had a gift for healing we know right he was given gifts of healing he didn't have to pray he just walked into the building and people started get up of out of wheelchairs people said I get healed people sought to be healed just like that without him I say in a word it's it speaks by itself but I'm saying if you stay in the gospel if you stay right one of these days God will call you aside and in the presence of angels he will gift you with something that will shake the world I drove a sail correctly but it's worse than that effect God will do it if you stay in the gospel if no you're born you are Hebrew in that sense you come into the land but you have to be placed you have to be positionally placed then everybody has a place every member of God's predestinated chosen bride there is a position then I Parabellum say let us not stop because God clean up our life and because you know he stopped us from we don't want to drink i me do wanna smoke and we don't wanna carry on we don't wanna run along you see let us not stop there but press on to a position there's a place for you God God has ordained for each and every one Amen all right who is the Lord praise the Lord he made me burn pits a mess at a time called he him where he went to where Paul spoke about the son though he was born a son but yet he was nothing more he wasn't above the servant in the house he was a son child a little child but I'm saying even shaven and he little child 1 the reason handle it yet you reach that stage where you could handle a razor but he might one degrees up so he has to grow and become a man I've become aware of what is what on you know on and before he could be handling these sort of things Obama say we are placed into the body is about what is the body of Christ he said some apostles some prophets some are teachers some evangelists and some pastors is all right we are called to he says butters has gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge miracles working of miracle all these different gifts so you see they are different is not only pastors and prophets and teachers and evangelists there are give up tongues anybody could ever give up tongue once it's God will for you you can have a give up the interpretation of tongues a give of wisdom a give of knowledge I'll give up miracles that ever work in a miracles all these different gifts so all of these things are in the body but you have to be placed into the body you're not just born again a little in front you can be placed yet you have to be trained and we know the story of the e the Father put in a tutor over his son to teach him the business and the tutor will be reporting and he typed that as the Holy Spirit reporting back to board and Simmel boy but if you see when your son do did you touch him to quantify the holy son behaving you know and he has to be tested and tried and even when this son because my beloved always saying that is what type a son he's not did nine years son you know you're born again a child of God but the Pentecostals were born again in 1906 and they taught that was it they taught the born of God and that was it and gives you among them and they they misuse he gives the misuse he gives you know they went about it and you're wrong and but did he teleport is that they taught that just to be born again that was it no we are born again you a child but then the message that we are received let me just read this year the message we have received is a take us from the birth we could stay at the Bottineau and field as a - yes Parabellum says here do you believe in dispensations Bible said so in the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time there's been a dispensation of well there was a dispensation of the Mosaic law there was a dispensation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there was a dispensation of church organization there was a dispensation of the outpouring of this holy spirit and hear what he said know the dispensation of adoption what the world written and runing for the would the creation itself god made man master of the earth where bam said Adam in the garden could have spoke to the river and say instead of going this way go this way so the earth knows is master and the earth is grown and the old one to see is master to Commander rule yet again what even God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something that first ride up and see if is right the Bible said try this spirit this man claim a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it is right move right with it then say Lord send us something else keep moving see just keep moving till every fellow takes his place then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get to its place then you're going to see the church I've got begin to get to split tens when the Philistines will go to backing up before last I'm not going to back up from a little child you understand I mean your child yes but you you wonderful it's tiny how is it the shorts that's when the church gets to this place the shorts will go off here will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get into its mighty power yet is when they have an Ananias and Sapphira and a few of them yes sir you'll see when that Holy Church stands together in its power positionally pleased sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful church standing there in his glory who that's what he's coming for no I mean since I come into the Ambassador looking to go in the rapture but you hear what you come in for is not just a Christian born-again believe God and baptized into the battle with holy spirit born again but you see the kind of church is coming for this that we just read yeah just standing in his power that's what he's coming for and there was a quote I do know it a friend but her heart is written here to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle and he talked about alright let me read this one year his Holy Spirit is here and he's trying to place his church in order place it in the promised land so that all the enemies can be drove out so is that train church like when Abraham Chi trained his his servants and he went after lot was taken by some kings there was this battle king some Kings against for against fight King and so on and so on and they had captured Sodom and they took a lot and his family and if we are trained his servants showing them men who grew up in his house trained them and went after the enemy and brought back his brother amen and this is what it's about because we had to start looking well I mean do that really you know in the spirit and seeking God they would be looking always I've been looking out I remember years ago when we just keep consciously Lord and boy you wanna tell everybody boy I used to Hong Kong my mother my mother was a catalyst used to sing any quiet ecologist and I used to be going to practice and I use abusive language and thing and when I get it goes both ways and be under my time he said Georgie he said leave me alone now boy he say you do your thing I let me do my thing but you know under you know of the way you can you cannot get cool you cannot lost that but there's a party you know where when say if you stop witnessing the people he said one of these days you're going to find yourself cold and formal and battery and backslidden it's not for you it's not for you you get it already but just as God came to you you had to go to somebody else and you have to tell it I'm I remember a long time you're drinking you want to make a jig furnace unrest and then you want to make it ring you're smoking some kind of wrong thing you know supposed to be smoking and you're wanting courage people to smoke it to you understand I know we have the real thing you gospel of Jesus Christ because Plus salvation Briella we have to shake over sell them so town board for the prayer coming up where we could well get down on our knees
