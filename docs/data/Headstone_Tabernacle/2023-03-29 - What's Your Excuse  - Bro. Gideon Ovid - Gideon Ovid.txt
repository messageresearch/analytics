praise foreign blessed be his wonderful name my it always is a blessing to gather together in this way and always deem it a privilege to be in the house of the Lord to worship and sing and and praise and rejoice and be among Brethren of like Precious Faith amen if you have your Bibles like you just tune quickly with me to a familiar scripture and we want to read from the book of Genesis reading from chapter 18 A few verses there from verse 9 to 14. hope everybody's feeling fine everybody's on the expectation my will just look and see what the Lord will do amen reading Genesis Chapter 18 verses 9 to 14. and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said and this is Abraham just as a context this is Abraham being visited and he said where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and look Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed All Shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety be a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord an honest Focus there at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen let's just pray once more Lord I pray that you bless your way that was red Lord I pray that you inspired tonight Lord I pray that you quickly to our hearts and your upma understanding Lord Lord I pray that these broken up words and thoughts that have been placed together pray that you would sow them together like a master tailor that you'll weave them together Lord so they they will make sense and and and we will be able to delve and dig into your word tonight Lord I pray that we will leave here blessed and and knowing that it was good for us to have been here Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seeds before I begin I just want to say thanks for the opportunity to be able to speak this evening and just to share a few words I I consider myself the least of the disciples but a disciple nonetheless amen you know I always say it's a privilege to be here and you could never be prepared enough you could never be ready enough but there's a time appointed that God will call and once he would have predestinated that it has to be delivered amen at this point just as as a title I want to say what's your excuse and we'll get into it in a little while but it's just that question what's your excuse you see the reason I chose this as a title the reason I chose it as a title is that I realized that there's a lot that's going on there's a lot of things that we read there's a lot of things that we see and a lot of times we get distracted and Disturbed and sometimes we miss the mark and and get off the trail or the track that'll be supposed to be on because we are comfortable and satisfied with making excuses sometimes we make them because of habit we saw a custom-making excuses that we continue doing it and other times we make it because we feel it's a it's a it's a cup out it's something that will make others believe or make God believe or make you know make people believe that we're okay so we'll use excuses sometimes we use excuses for failure sometimes we fail in doing the things that we're supposed to do so instead of acknowledging that that we didn't do it we will make an excuse sometimes our excuse may even be hinge on other people so so you will hear us just to make it familiar and and to understand the context we will say but everybody do that we'll see but it's not as bad as no you really failed you know you really didn't do what you were supposed to do but we tend to make excuses and my question tonight is what's your excuse and I'm gonna jump to the conclusion so up front I know it may seem a little back to front but the conclusion is I have searched I have researched and I am yet to find an excuse that is acceptable to God that God will say you know what I like that one that's a good excuse no matter what you think I don't think you have an original excuse that God could accept and I will just jump down a little bit you see often times we have some excuses that are very very familiar and I will give you an example for example Tonight We Gather here and I was asking your pastor tonight I say you recall that in Trinidad we have a holiday tomorrow so I know we packed out tonight because there's a holiday tomorrow we do have work we do have school we probably don't have to take everything too much we don't have to uh to iron in advance because it's a holiday it's a Morrow so what we will do we will sit back despite the fact that there's a holiday tomorrow and say you know what these three days were so tiring a real dad I would love to go up or no but are tired that is an excuse so so the reason you're not praising and worshiping and gathering in the house of God as you should or as the scriber as required is because you make excuses and it makes you feel comfortable so what you're doing say well you know I should really go you know but so so so stay in home too or so so do it too so we kind of hinge on that and God don't like it God will accept that he not buying that you know why I often use that one you see being tired being tired is a state it's a it's a health condition that you feel tired so it's normal you work hard and you feel tired you're required to sleep right even God he created created after six days and you rested so that's a natural progression to feel tired however the question I have for you tonight is how come Wendy the airline saying the flight is 1am 10 o'clock you in the airport nine o'clock in the airport the flight is 4 a.m one o'clock in the airport somehow you don't feel too tired right because we know we have an appointment to keep so it's not so much the tiredness but the level of importance that you play that your place on the activity that's required so I just want to highlight a couple of things you know some of the excuses we get all in our minds so you know we say we say things like you know I'm not sure how to do it I do have the experience I don't know how to pray I don't know how to cry out unto God I don't know how to call upon his name you know we hear these things and after a while it's freeze this is tombs it's things that we get a custom hearing that's why I say some of it is very familiar so you say well you know what I am crying out right now oh no because brother so so not crying out right now you know I I have praying real hard or Earnest or really desperate right now because I really have something to do after and in reality that's simply or merely excuses you're making right but you know when you read the Bible you'll see that excuse car whole water as we say because even Jesus when his disciples say teach us to pray we don't know how to do it you know what he said Our Father Who Art in Heaven and he took the time to teach them so there was a way so the car come next we can say well you know we don't know how to pray you know we can't pray because he already decided listen I'm not taking that excuse so I will teach you if I have to I will guide if I have true I will pull you through the fire and the flood and through the water and through great trials if I have to because I want the outcome that I want and that's the kind of God we serve he not willing to take excuses so I still ask the question what's your excuse tonight because we all make excuses for things we do for things we don't do for things we fail at the things even our successes we make excuses at so I want to come back to a couple scriptures and and and highlight a couple other things like I say is a simple it's a simple thing I want to share but in my research as well I found out that God do require much of you you know you know that you know we try to complicate things but God don't require much I have realized you know one time I was working and and the manager used to quote something and he used to say success leave Clues if you want to be successful you just do what successful people do right in the Bible when you saw the story of Cain and Abel God said do as your brother do and you get the same result so it goes to reason that if you do the things that God requires you'll get the same result that God promised not so so with that in mind I realized that he didn't require much you know he said I want obedience we heard it on Sunday you say I want obedience so I want you to obey my word I want you to obey what my prophets say I want you to obey what the minister say because if he is my mouthpiece right now and he said this and this is what I want for you tonight I want you to be obedient to that and I will bless that and more than that I Will Bless even your obedience to it even if you don't understand it does that make sense no when I looked at that in particular I realized he he required a couple of other things no I'm not saying this is an exhaustive list I'm not saying this is all he required but he required a couple other things one of the things he required is that you said the right thing he he really likes that apparently you know he likes you to say the right thing he he rewards that right he takes pride in the fact that his children no matter big or small could say the right thing and with that in mind that there is a message for the brown and preach called go tell and paragraph 186 he said you know the two little boys are sitting here speaking about sister Hattie Wright I'm sure we're all familiar with it I always say I don't try to reinvent the wheel I'm not preaching my own thoughts and ideas I'm not sharing anything I'm made up and it says the two little boys are probably sitting here in the meeting somewhere this morning now this wasn't at the time my sister had had to write requested the salvation of her two boys this is after the fact and he said they probably sit in somewhere so he's looking in the audience and say they're probably sitting somewhere are they here with you so he's asking her and she is there in the back and you see in the back in the back where are you boys raise up your hands where's the two boys there they are standing in the back so they obviously stood up and he said there they are standing back in the back God bless you all right there you are now what happened and he went back into the story and he said the same thing no matter what she'd have happened what she'd have asked she could have had it she could have got it now I'm wanting to see that happen no here it is you say I'm wanting to see that happen which had happened before all right you say it's going to be the attitude of the people towards the message see how she she said it she said just the right thing it's what you say that does it what you see right so that's why I said earlier you do have to understand everything but given the scenario and if we backtrack a little bit whether Brandon was there and he was giving the the illustration the synopsis of what transpired with the squirrels and as he was giving the story she sat right there and at the conclusion he said thus said the Lord you said the right thing and you could have a million dollars you could have whatever you asked for and he gave her the option he gave her the opportunity to choose and you know what he said you said the right thing and because of that it didn't matter I always say it doesn't matter the distance it doesn't matter the time the space wherever you are God could reach you wherever you are right now tonight so so it brings us back to another excuse you know we often say listen you don't know what I'm going through you don't know the drama I have home right you know what that is an excuse so I asked you again what's your excuse because it's easy to say you don't know what I have to deal with but you know your scenario different your scenario nice but look look at this how Boys Wouldn't win Christians but Abraham said that they want Christian boys but you know what she just by having a desire and saying the right thing was able to achieve the salvation of her two boys amen so what's your excuse tonight your family your friends your loved ones because I'll tell you there's a young man and his excuses we're talking about to ask you about your exes and you know you'll often hear things like all you don't understand and all you don't understand my family don't even like me sometimes you say I'm the black sheep they do even like me right but you know what there was a next guy whose family didn't like him in case you didn't know his name is Joseph they didn't like him so you know what they chose to do they took him and they saw them into slavery at first the treatment are pit they say we will make up a story and say he died at that some wild animals took him but all that was the distract from what was really taking place God actually had a plan beyond that right so so let's just just look at it for a second if your excuse is not your family don't like you how do you not know per Adventure God is setting up the scenario for you to be able to deliver them for you to be positionally placed that you could assist and help them instead of sitting back and making excuses just acts and move forward just hold on to the promise of God and realize that we've seen it before the same way brother Branham said listen that's what I would like to see I'd like to see that again I'd like to see it over and over because if you do the same thing you will get the same results [Music] so we we talk about a couple excuses you know at times they say well you know I long in the vineyard I owe you a long time I've seen this before we've gone through this before you know we've seen seen Revival after Revival we've heard preaching we have we've had conventions we had things but but I looking for the coming of the Lord are looking for for God to come down and do things 40 years 50 15 3 years think about it that's another excuse so the reason you're not praising prison and worshiping like God is coming tonight is because you believe you waiting long I will tell you and you knew it already there was a guy named Noah he was preaching a hundred and twenty years it will rain it will rain as a matter of fact if we look at Abraham brother Branham said you know God couldn't tell him you have to wait for 25 years you know why because the attitude would have been the front the kind of passion and perseverance and persistence you can imagine him going by the doctor every year twice a year three times a year every quarter for a checkup this they thought he was mad you know but he was so convinced of the promise of God that he was pressing forward like never before year in year out Noah was so convinced that he gathered his family to biliacono I know what you're thinking you know that was back then and that was his family and they had little choice but to believe God spoke to him directly but you know God speak to you directly too imagine this is the next one you know there are those who say you know nobody does really come and minister to me nobody does share things with me and encourage me and motivate me and really you know Raise Me Up and lift me up and make me feel great but when I really would there was a fella named job I don't know if you're no job right but I read about job and they say you know he encourage himself he did never pass to a preacher or somebody to share an openly word and say brother Joe we heard anything I want you to keep pressing on you know I want you to stay strong I want you to keep doing that and I want you you know stay with me no he didn't have that but you know what he was in a very very unusual position and I know it may seem all over the place tonight but I want to backtrack a little bit you backtrack we'll come back to job I want to come to the Battleground and you see you know everything I say in here already so in the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 67 right he said there has to be a place selected and in this there's a mutual ground no man's land and they fight here at this place they just don't one fight over here and one dog here and one run over here there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army tested strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place now don't don't miss this you want you to get it he said when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds began under human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin and that is because that decisions are made from the Mind ahead no they never started it from from some organization they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds way of got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you right so it's so interesting that the Battleground is in the mind the Battleground is in mind remember that now the Battleground isn't a mind so a lot of what we go through a lot of the excuses we make a lot of the failures and short comments that we have is really right upstairs here you know right upstairs here in your mind imagine there was a man who said listen in our eyes we look like grasshoppers there was a next one who said I am the lease of My Tribe my tribe is the least my family is Elise I am the smallest we can't do anything that is in their mind you know so once again I asked you what's your excuse if this is the Battleground every Battleground is in your mind it means you need to fix your mind yeah because imagine God say as a man think in his heart so he is so he is so is he it means this is where a lot of the problems are at so we need to sort that out we need to fix that so you can see the pictures clearly so can you imagine if we stop making excuses listen if you could only stop making excuses I will tell you something I started off and I said God don't require much I could recall that and I said what do you think she requires obedience he wants us to say the right thing you know what else he wants he wants the right attitude strange enough I never say he wants you to think to figure it out you know because he say you know listen this should be the same for the most illiterate person you don't have to try intellectual gymnastics and semantics and try to flip it and form a quadratic equation and and say the solution is and therefore proven you don't have to prove it you know the word Vindicated already all you have to do is have faith and believe and abide by his requirements so if you require for you to be obedient be obedient if you require that you said the right thing see the right thing if he requires that you have the right attitude now listen I don't have to say it but I want to read it for you in the same message go tell paragraph 189 he said look at the syrophision woman when she come to Jesus she said Lord my daughter is Grievous grievously vexed with a devil thou son of David come heal her he said and we know it it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs this is better Brian would snow he said what if he would have said that to some of us to some of us we say call me a dog huh wasn't nothing to him nothing but a belzebub we'd have that attitude but not her she said it's true Lord she accepted what was even said about her and based on her attitude remember the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring us apart so so here he hears us now she said you're exactly right in essence I accept it you're right that's the truth to say but the dogs are willing to eat these crops under the children's table and and listen you say that got him he said for this saying the devil left your daughter for the same so just have any right attitude just changing your pictures a little bit just sorting out your mind a little bit just getting in line with what God wants you to see the perspective that he's trying to show you will change your results so if we could do away with the excuses you realize victory is yours the battle is not yours but if victory is yours if you could do that listen get started God will do do the rest but you can't start with excuses with excuses you have nothing to get that's failure making an excuses failure so I I hope that by the end of this we could look at ourselves and do some introspection and realize wait a minute what kind of excuses have I been making what's my excuse that's why the title was your excuse what excuse you have for not reading the Bible what excuse you have for not share any word and evangelize them what excuse you have for praising halfway well God that promotion has come true yet you know you know that that I really praying and hoping for that but what if God just looking to see if you could praise what if God look in the city level of worship that you give him you know you know what you see God is looking for somebody the more He blesses he will humbly becomes what if God is just testing you and watching you and watching your behavior and watching your attitude and watching your operation all along and you sit back trying to judge God and gorgeous watching just waiting on you saying I'm watching you I'm watching you are watching you but but you know what I know at times you say you know it's not me you know I doing all your writings but if you understand on my workplace the boss don't like me as pressure they try to harass me to try to box me and they try to do all kind of thing but I'll tell you about a guy I know you know the guy you ever heard about Dan Daniel listen they changed laws for Daniel they listen this is not they tell you sit down there you know they go to Parliament and change the legislation to ensure that you can do particular things you know so which which pressure are we talking about what's your excuse your boss change your laws your boss put restrictions on you that you can't pray for your meal your boss change the fact that listen right now we are the month of Ramadan and Muslims pray five times a day throughout the year in the month of Ramadan in addition to that they have extra prayers they have fasting and breaking up fast religiously what's your excuse what was your excuse you're busy oh I forgot you're busy I did say earlier on I've not seen an excuse that God could accept that he said hey you hear what this one is a tough one I never encountered this one before this one is original I do know how to do you know what to get a blah you get a pass God have no grandchildren God promises his same the same requirement he said listen in the 11th I was the same pay tenth hour same pay requirement is the same so what's your excuse [Music] you know as we look I know there are those who might say you know are too old them things are asking me to do are you able with that Abraham was seen as too old to know that all you will promise me this promise me a son but what did God say he had a phrase and I told you hold on to it earlier you say is anything too hard for God anything nothing nothing nothing so all those Desires in your heart all those requests that you have and your silence I stop asking for it because perhaps God don't want to do that God just looking to see her body I wanted to know he wanted to see how much you believe in him because he promised it he promised you the Holy Ghost but you know what I asked faith I asked for the aspects and it's a rich yet so I take it I given God a little rest now I I don't want a song Maybe I don't want a song dependent I don't want a song you know like a nagging I don't want a song so at all but you know what you see you have not because you're astronaut you understand he say listen seek and you will find knock and will be opened he gave a blueprint that if you follow these things if you could say the right thing if you could have the right attitude if you have to be obedient to my word speaking of obedience I want a reference you may be seated I want to reference the story of Elijah you know Elijah his story is quite extensive but I want to hold into the path when he met the widow woman you see there are those who might say you don't don't know my scenario I have no husband I I don't have much money I don't have much resources I struggling what I described there was her story that was her story and he still went to her and give her an instruction she didn't have to understand it she didn't have to think it through she didn't have to try to figure it out or perhaps if I do this I wonder hmm what might happen boy she wasn't playing the lotto no she let me read it she was just being obedient to the word of God it's one a little long so I'll skip through you know there's a message the reaction to an action and I'll show you what he looking for from paragraph 40 and this is the interesting thing that oftentimes we don't realize that God had lead us work on one side yeah he don't really work on one side you know I realized he just work on both sides so he know the end before the beginning he will tell you I want you to walk there brother Branham gave the illustration so beautifully he said listen he had a plane to catch and go tell him come walk I will show you where to go walk turn here go there when you go down on this side you will see a house there's a lady sitting right there so God was given instructions on this side and on the other side she was praying and when she saw him she said good morning person you say I've been praying and God told me he will send his servant here so God does work on both sides the challenge I have is that we don't have to seek something brand new we are not trying to reinvent the wheel we're taking the same promises that he gave and making them more real and making them of Greater effect and greater impact to us today we're not trying something we're not trying to create brand new we're not trying to create something that song interesting for 2023 we still happen and horn in on the same promise that he gave 10 years ago 20 years ago 40 years ago six years ago the same promise because it is the same yesterday today and forever in that message that I referenced earlier which is the reaction to an action he said he give him a vision I could see him walking down the street this is Elijah now the Lord must have told him this there'd be an old woman looking old she's young but she's looking old you see that her shoulders are stooped she's her shoulders are ragged her arms are out her sleeves should be out in the yard with two sticks in her hand and Elijah you know what that means what will be in about 800 years from now and as he walked he seen the woman he leaned over the little fence and said fetch me a little drink of water and she turned to say something and she thought that's a kind old man he speaks a little different from the ordinary men there's something about God's children that they know one another you see that something there's always been they know one another my sheep know my voice said Jesus and there she looked and she heard she looked at him and she said there must be something Godly about that old man said fetch me a little drink of water she nodded her head she would do it and she started to go away what then she heard a voice again and bring in your hand a little cake for me to eat a morsel of bread and she said this is where we started getting our heads now and and she said I have just enough for me and my little starving boy and I'm out here getting these two sticks I've just mixed it together dressed it and now I've got these two sticks to make a fire to make the cake and he and I will eat it and die then she heard she started to turn again and she heard a voice saying but bring me one first two that shows insistence he insisted hear what I'm not too concerned about your thoughts and ideas right now your mind doesn't matter you're not battling there I'm giving you an instruction bring me one first look she didn't have to go down and get her last penny he wasn't asking her for money he wasn't asking her from her resources she had to go down and get her last piece of bread this is a very sustenance now she didn't have to go for this or that or maybe change doctors or so forth some little insignificant thing but she had to go to the only thing that stood between her and death and her child so this is all she had she had nothing else this was it bring me a little cake first in your hand I can see her not her head obedient that's what God requires there's a prophet saying it this is not me this is the prophet saying obedience that's what God requires you get the word and the spirit mixed together self-sacrifice obedience when God's Prophet says a certain thing do it hold on to it she bowed her head yes sir sounds like the army yes certain instruction Amen to the instruction Amen to the word and she starts on then she heard the sweetest thing she've ever heard that all sufficient word that all of us listen for for there come across that Gates a blast from that prophet's voice said for thus said the Lord amen that's what we look to hear thus said the Lord the barrel will not go empty or the crews will fail until the day that God sends rain on the earth there it was amen so we see once again God requires obedience and he rewards that not your excuse it was an excuse to say this is all I have that we're going to eat this and die that's in your mind that's what you think that's what you feel that's what your emotions tell you but what did God's Prophet say what did God say what was the instruction if you're obedient to the word of God you would see he said obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the token and the token is a requirement so he calls us to be obedient amen I'm almost done I'm almost done you know at times we may sit back and say you know based on our past you don't understand my past not me but you may say you don't understand where I was where I come from I was a criminal I was a bandit I was a thief I was whatever I can't have no no no no restoration for me it can't have justification for me but you know what I think up to Sunday or last Wednesday we heard it there was a man next to Jesus on the cross and you know the story he was a career Criminal he was now regular Bandit he wasn't doing petty crime you know he not pickpocket in you know and then them days is a real deal because his penalty was death so he was to be crucified and he stood right next to Christ and you remember the three things I said I said just three things God requires not a whole big complex complicated thing he requires obedience he requires that you say the right thing and requires the right attitude so while imagine a crowd wanted to crucify Jesus and that they wanted to make sure that he was dead this man stood in the midst of all he talk in the midst of the back and forth and he said listen hear what hear what anybody could say anything you know but this man is an innocent man I know I am a criminal I know my sins I know my struggles I know my battles I deserve to be where I am now and he turned to Christ and said you know what just remember me because I I have accepted my position I know who I am I'm being sincere and honest about my cookery my my my my band the tree my thievery my my my criminal past and Jesus turned to him and see this D you will be with me in Paradise so I ask again what's your excuse you rubbed somebody 10 years ago 20 years ago last week last month the god I served is able to deliver listen when I listen when you study the scripture and study the message I am marveled all the time to think that when you consider the fact and are not going into biology class but when you consider the fact that you are here and God imagine before the foundation of the Earth he chose you and knew that you'll be predestinated for this time scientists still discovering things they're still finding things as a matter of fact just last week I believe they named I believe it's a microscopic womb after Trinidadian scientists right this is present tense they still discovering things and before the beginning of the earth God saw you in this time he had to know what he was doing so so I realized that God don't operate like us most of the time some of the time he kind of mirrors us you know or we mirror him we kind of behave like like him because I was reviewing there's a message choosing a bride and it occurred that imagine as man in paragraph 79 it says but you know you have to plan look Pray when chosen for we see by this the Word of Promise she the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him now could you imagine a man filled with a holy ghost take something like that to your wife congregation says no I just don't see it brother now maybe I'm just an old crank but you know I just can't understand that see notice for it's going to reflect what's in him she's going to help him make his future home now I read that because this is an inatural right and the God we serve say he is choosing a bride you think he go into the club to pick up a bride you think you go in any dumpster look for his bride or he want his bride be the best that he could get as a matter of fact he want to micromanage your bride because he wanted bride to be just like him he want the bride to be such a reflection of him that if somebody look on the outside they don't even know if he Brides it or if he say it because you know what he said the word is in the bride here's the word right so after a while you will look and you don't even know if you're looking at the bride or you're looking at Christ right because of the type of bride he wants so it's not a random or by chance or or a random occurrence so when he chose you it's not by chance he didn't decide yesterday you know what I feel like going and choose brother popwell so you know what he goes show up to church tomorrow because I choose him yesterday no he no operates so he not haphazard and and you know just anyhow anyhow he want to make sure he could test he could try he could carry her through the fire see how you're fair if you don't make it he send it through the test a second time he he raised up the temperature a little bit because he wants to know that you could stand and you could could hold on to his promise Perhaps Perhaps you kill the bear so he will send a lion he wanted to know that he could overcome that and then Goliath come in you know because he wants to train your particular way is the same if you have a if if you want a Bella Army you think you just go in at the side side of the road and and they say come come you know what little army come with no experience you never shoot a firearm you know you have no background at all and you're building an army which battle have I done you setting up yourself Alex but you know what you will say well boy if you know where I pick up these guys you know what those things are excuses so the God I serve not into the excuse in business so he does go before and plan you know that there's a concept called The Art of War right and part of it and I'm seeing where Christ did it all the time you know what he will do let me just give you a secret right it's right there anyway he will go and because he know the end before the beginning he will study the opposition he will study your tactics he will study exactly what's going on with you he know your techniques he know exactly how you're going to come you know it's just like a good coach a good coach go tell your players go and play a no you go win go and play no you know what a good coach does the good coach will look at videos he will look at the opposition see how they're playing studying this like a personal want to make sure we understand what we're up against and when you capture the mind of that then you come to your star players and they say listen the week on the left foot or the week on the left side so I want you to run this way and pass this one because they tend to Shield this one all the time so they study the opposition and then attack you with me so that's the way he is so so here here's this thing here's the thing God have this done to our science he have this done listen you can't fool him your car trick him which family can destroy this weak Boy Who he could cause some problems cause some drama get him out of thoughts you know he won them you know not be in alignment he don't want cohesion or you or you that's not at all you're cause I'm doing that so he goes around looking for the weak links as a matter of fact if you read the scripture he'll say he was walking up and down but he was passing he kept passenger somehow he didn't want to stop by job at all he didn't want to to go and meddle with job you know why because he said God God have a hedger on him God protecting him God have him favored and special God have a special plan and a purpose for him it's just like like as we go through the scripture we see that the devil has operate a particular way but we as men we as humans sometimes we can't anticipate what he going to do but God is always a few steps ahead so so God say listen let me choose a Brothers to get rid of him because you don't want to all them dreams you know we don't want you don't want the destruction we want things to go wrong we want things to go bad not knowing god already planned listen hear what I need to find a way for Joseph to move from his household to be in Egypt and be responsible for the food because if I could make you the Finance Minister if I could meet you the the leader of of of all the Grain and all the food you could help to sustain your farm your family and have such a name that you can have influence God thought by changing sorry say it untoward by changing laws and changing things and Esther was going to buckle and fail and fall and shovel up not knowing wait no that is exactly where I want you to be that is exactly the position I want you in because in that time when I call you to act I want to be in a particular place I don't want to be moping listen when you look at Jonah Jonah had a commission he knew exactly what was required of him but you know what he did excuses you say you know what then people Wicked the evil Van Damme get rid of them drawing them kill them you know I don't want to go there somebody else could go right by who pick somebody else not me I want another assignment I want another task but God's saying you're finished just like Moses you're done all right you're still going whether you like it or not he ran away that is mental his his emotions said hear what I want to escape God I run in far but little did he know remember what I said God works on both sides God already had a prepared fish you think the fish was born the day before God had a prepared vessel that's what it was we call call it a fish but was a prepared vessel to take Jonah exactly where God wanted exactly where God wanted him because brother Abraham said they worship a fish God so can you imagine you worship the fish God and God Almighty sent a man walking out of the fish to come and bring his word What a Mighty God be serve because I serve not easy you know he is determined that no matter what excuse you come up with how you try to flip it how you try to turn it whatever you try to put together he is not accepting that Moses after trained in Egypt listen he was what you call a diplomat a dignitary he was well trained and when he came face to face with the pillar of fire he said God I can't talk I don't know anything I can represent you I can go and free The Children of Israel at all God say you're finished that's the best you have that excuse when I look at my book of excuses here that one exhausted you know somebody use that already that car top thing we could fix that if your car talk I could send somebody to talk I could I could put something in place for that so I realized whatever your excuses tonight got bigger than that God don't deal with that already right he moved past that already he just requires that you do what he asked he wants you to be obedient he wants you to have the right attitude he wants you to say the right thing he don't want excuses when you fail and fall accept wrong surrender to him repent to him and move forward knowing that he is faithful and able to deliver and bless you exceedingly and abundantly above all you could ask or think every promise that he left is still there for you but you have to act upon it put away the excuses forget the excuses and plunge into the fullness of God God bless you [Applause] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
