[37:13] amen well before I bring my greetings
[37:15] let's stand to let's let me read my
[37:17] scriptures um if you have a bibl like to
[37:20] invite attention to Genesis chter 1 and
[37:24] uh Revelation 12 and Leviticus
[37:28] 23 Genesis CH 1 I read verse 2 through
[37:32] verse 5 and that's where I get my child
[37:35] from this
[37:38] morning Jes chter 1
[37:41] um I begin to read
[37:43] from verse two and the Earth was without
[37:47] form and void and darkness was upon the
[37:50] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[37:52] moved upon the face of the
[37:54] waters and God said let there be light
[37:58] and there was light and God saw the
[38:00] light that it was good and God divided
[38:03] the light from the darkness and God
[38:05] called the light day and the Darkness he
[38:08] called night and the evening and the
[38:10] morning were the first day and that's
[38:13] where my ttle is from my title and the
[38:16] evening and the morning were the first
[38:19] day
[38:20] amen let's go right back to Revelation
[38:25] from Genesis right down to Rev
[38:27] ation 12 and this speaking about the war
[38:30] in
[38:30] heaven I read verse 7 through:
[38:39] 11 and you have a marker you can go to
[38:41] Leviticus 23 verse
[38:45] 33-36 Revelation 12 I read from verse 7
[38:50] and there was one in heaven Michael and
[38:52] his angels fought against the dragon and
[38:54] the dragon fought and his angels and
[38:57] prevailed not neither was the place for
[38:59] any more in heaven and the Great Dragon
[39:01] was cast out that old serpent called the
[39:04] devil and Satan which deceived the whole
[39:06] world he was casted into the Earth and
[39:09] his angels were casted with him and I
[39:11] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[39:13] is come salvation and strength and the
[39:15] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[39:18] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[39:21] is cast down which accused them before
[39:23] our God day and night and they overcame
[39:25] him by the blood of am and by the word
[39:27] of their testimony and they love not
[39:29] their lives unto the death

[56:13] put some f it that makes it a
[56:15] sacrifice amen and you know the only
[56:19] person that offers a sacrifice to the
[56:21] Lord is a
[56:23] priest amen so in this holy convocation
[56:26] here you come here with a recognition
[56:28] that you are a preach unto the Lord to
[56:31] have your offering your sacrifice to
[56:33] offer to God

[56:46] amen amen now let's talk a little bit
[56:49] about this let's talk a little bit about
[56:51] this priesthood let's talk about about
[56:53] this priesthood here because you know a
[56:56] priest offers a sacrifice unto the Lord
[56:58] so when God says each one of the
[57:00] household of Israel and each one of us
[57:02] here will offer an offering made by fire
[57:05] unto the Lord is a recognition that we
[57:07] are priest unto the Lord and doesn't the
[57:09] Bible say we are Kings and Priests unto
[57:11] the Lord and we shall rign on the earth
[57:14] so something letting you understand are
[57:16] we run about that
[57:18] time tell me letting you understand this
[57:21] is what is this what this holy
[57:22] convention is about to tell me to get up
[57:24] my aship you are a priest unto the Lord
[57:27] you are a king unto the Lord you got
[57:29] power you got Authority you got Dominion
[57:32] that's what God told Mo to tell the
[57:33] people get out of your Ash get off your
[57:36] morning spots Hallelujah stand on your
[57:39] feet you are going to offer an offering
[57:41] made by fire you are a priest come on
[57:43] you priest of the Lord
[57:46] hallelujah glory glory to God amen
[57:51] amen amen you may be seated Hallelujah
[57:55] and
[57:56] then every priest is known by the
[58:01] offering or sacrifice he
[58:04] offerers now Jesus Christ Our Lord is
[58:07] called the high priest of our confession
[58:11] in other words what he offers to God is
[58:15] our
[58:16] confession he takes our confession and
[58:19] offer it to God that's how he becomes
[58:21] the high priest of our confession
[58:24] whatever we confess he offers it to God
[58:27] and the high priest makes sure to make
[58:30] sure he makes sure we get whatever we
[58:33] confess
[58:37] Hallelujah so in this holy convocation
[58:39] here you are going to get what you
[58:42] [Music]
[58:45] confess your confession is your
[58:48] sacrifice your confession is your
[58:50] sacrifice and whatsoever you confess the
[58:53] high priest stands there to offer it to
[58:54] God God hallelujah and that's why in
[58:58] this only convocation here there's no
[58:59] negative talk like brother R was telling
[59:01] last night there's no weakness there's
[59:03] no I can there's no this not working out
[59:05] no sirar whatsoever you confess the high
[59:08] priest takes it to the
[59:10] Lord be careful be careful what you say
[59:15] because your high priest is just going
[59:16] to make sure you get what you what you
[59:18] asked
[59:19] for amen
[59:21] hallelujah
[59:23] hallelujah so this holy conation
[59:26] here the high priest God is making sure
[59:30] our speech is going to
[59:32] change our atud is going to change
[59:35] everything is going to change we're
[59:38] going to defy everything else where
[59:40] there is weakness if you say Lord I'm so
[59:43] weak everything is so going wrong for me
[59:45] that's your confession that's your
[59:48] sacrifice you are bringing and that's
[59:49] what the high priest takes to the Lord
[59:51] be careful now because the high priest
[59:53] says As You Are said in my ears so will
[59:56] I do unto you amen

[1:00:46] gathering together of the people because
[1:00:47] it's assembly Sodom assembly is a
[1:00:50] serious
[1:00:51] hour not for people who are not made up
[1:00:54] in their mind to go not for people who
[1:00:56] are you know just loding around and LLY
[1:00:58] gagging around or not for people who you
[1:01:01] have to tell them come on don't see
[1:01:03] what's going on no God tell Mo would
[1:01:05] tell the people that and God himself
[1:01:08] made sure that each person not Moses
[1:01:12] going around each person he was to call
[1:01:14] the assembly and tell them this is the
[1:01:16] word of the Lord to them and each person

[1:36:02] before it ever happened at all amen amen
[1:36:07] amen election looks back to for
[1:36:10] knowledge the for knowledge comes first
[1:36:13] and in the for knowledge Elohim knew
[1:36:15] everything the for knowledge was not him
[1:36:17] the back part was him the for was just
[1:36:20] his knowledge of what was going to be on
[1:36:22] the face of the Earth from Eden Right
[1:36:24] Back to Eden
[1:36:26] again in there in the for knowledge he
[1:36:29] knew what was going to be he knew every
[1:36:32] life that will be on the face of the
[1:36:33] Earth like he knew every fly and how
[1:36:35] many times will B its eye he knew
[1:36:38] everything he knew every serpent every
[1:36:41] seed every body that will be on the face
[1:36:43] of the Earth like brother R told Isaac
[1:36:45] yesterday he knew brother Paul wasn't
[1:36:46] going to be here and as was going to
[1:36:48] take his place in the full knowledge he

[1:36:55] every sin every filth every ungodliness
[1:36:59] that will ever take place on the face of
[1:37:00] the Earth in the for knowledge so you
[1:37:03] know the for knowledge is not him that's
[1:37:05] not his thinking just what he

[1:37:38] an amateure God on the face of the Earth
[1:37:41] he was ruling this Earth in the place of
[1:37:43] God
[1:37:44] himself yet when Adam sinned and fell
[1:37:49] God said when he drove the man out he
[1:37:51] said let the man put forth his hand and
[1:37:54] take us of the tree of life and become
[1:37:57] as one of us knowing good and evil now
[1:38:03] Lord come on now I thought you said Adam
[1:38:05] was an amateur God Like You on the face
[1:38:08] of the
[1:38:10] Earth so how come God saying let the man
[1:38:14] come and become like one of us knowing

[2:00:10] from a fight no we never run from a
[2:00:14] fight Hallelujah and Michael for and
[2:00:17] Lucifer Ford and Michael for and
[2:00:19] FR long story short over seven Church
[2:00:24] ages this war went on and at the end of
[2:00:28] the war what happened one third of the
[2:00:32] Angels were deceived by Lucifer and
[2:00:36] Michael said I won't have this here he
[2:00:38] threw them out of Heaven kick them out
[2:00:40] of
[2:00:40] [Applause]
[2:00:41] Heaven God that's the power in the
[2:00:44] Kingdom kick him
[2:00:45] out so you have the power to kick him
[2:00:47] out of your your
[2:00:51] life so what happened what happened one
[2:00:55] thought was kicked out of heaven and
[2:00:59] there remain two thoughts a revelation
[2:01:02] there one thir two thoughts means there
[2:01:05] are three groups here that's what it
[2:01:08] means means there are three groups
[2:01:12] here one group was kicked out all
[2:01:18] right
[2:01:20] and one group was from the back part
[2:01:24] there's this other group here we don't
[2:01:26] know where they're coming
[2:01:29] from brother bham said there are four
[2:01:31] parts to the Book of Life one part is
[2:01:35] not even written at
[2:01:36] all because forever oh Lord the word is
[2:01:40] set in heaven all that happened in the
[2:01:44] beginning when Elohim UNM into the logos
[2:01:47] and created angels all throughout that's
[2:01:50] all that has been happening on the face
[2:01:52] of the Earth it was
[2:01:54] previewed before the foundation of the
[2:01:57] world and that's what has been happening
[2:01:59] and God preved it there the fourth group
[2:02:03] serpent said God has nothing to do with
[2:02:05] them their record is not there at
[2:02:11] all but this is the four knowledge
[2:02:13] playing out now and in this for
[2:02:15] knowledge here every life is there
[2:02:17] except the serpent seed
[2:02:19] you are there those who are kicked out
[2:02:22] are there and there this other
[2:02:23] mysterious group also is there amen so
[2:02:26] there are three groups
[2:02:28] there he had seen you and Tak you out of
[2:02:31] there and put you on the back part of
[2:02:33] his
[2:02:33] mind so you're one group other
[2:02:37] group stood with Lucifer and they were
[2:02:39] kicked out that's like the borderline
[2:02:42] Believers but land believers who almost
[2:02:46] come
[2:02:47] in almost come
[2:02:50] in and the cares of Life they got
[2:02:54] deceived like Judas come to the
[2:02:59] borders and back
[2:03:02] off Hallelujah but there's this other
[2:03:05] groupall who was not deceived they are
[2:03:07] not from the back part of elohim's mind
[2:03:10] but they were not deceived who are
[2:03:12] they they the foolish virgins the
[2:03:15] foolish virgins they are not they are
[2:03:16] not elected to be in the bride so
[2:03:18] they're not from the backpacked that's
[2:03:19] right but it didn't take Sid of
[2:03:21] Lucifer religious Christian people good
[2:03:25] people good people they didn't get
[2:03:28] kicked out they didn't take their names
[2:03:30] out of the
[2:03:32] book Pentecostal people deceived by you
[2:03:38] know or Roberts and these other
[2:03:41] different Pentecostal groups and you
[2:03:43] know we have many of them in Nigeria I
[2:03:45] don't know here so many of them know who
[2:03:47] have been taught to believe that they
[2:03:49] can live worldly and still have
[2:03:53] Jesus who have been taught to believe
[2:03:55] that they love God in their
[2:03:59] hearts they s with God but they are not
[2:04:02] predestinated to be in the
[2:04:05] bride the foolish virgins and will take
[2:04:07] a chance at the great white Throne
[2:04:10] judgment to enter into life Hallelujah
[2:04:14] and another group also there is the
[2:04:16] Matthew 25
[2:04:17] group they are also did not take sight
[2:04:20] they formed this second group mysterious
[2:04:24] group that wasn't kicked out that was
[2:04:26] not the
[2:04:31] [Applause]
[2:04:34] bride there they were the foolish
[2:04:37] virgins religious people another group
[2:04:40] amen Matthew 25 the Sheep
[2:04:46] Nations
[2:04:47] who
[2:04:49] do good things to the bride who are
[2:04:51] going to receive eternal life because
[2:04:54] their goodness to the people of
[2:04:57] godj and then also the 144,000 form part
[2:05:01] of this group here that's all that's
[2:05:03] going to be that's the second group
[2:05:05] right they didn't take size with Lucifer
[2:05:07] but they were not predated to being the
[2:05:08] bride these good people do things that
[2:05:12] the people in the Brad are supposed to
[2:05:14] do but they will never do people in the
[2:05:15] message rather are supposed to will
[2:05:16] never do
[2:05:23] Hallelujah so what do you have three
[2:05:26] groups the bride the foolish virgins
[2:05:29] group and the borderline Believers the
[2:05:32] Bine Believers were kicked
[2:05:34] out so you have the two thirs the bright
[2:05:38] the foolish virgins
[2:05:41] Hallelujah that stood with
[2:05:43] Michael Oh Glory Hallelujah glory to God
[2:05:47] Amen
[2:05:51] and whener was kicked out of
[2:05:54] heaven Elohim was done hallelujah then
[2:05:58] now the book of life could be written
[2:06:00] and expressed and after the war in
[2:06:02] heaven The Book of Life was written and
[2:06:04] expressed and forever oh Lord that word
[2:06:07] is settled and written and expressed in
[2:06:10] heaven Oh Glory to God Amen and there
[2:06:15] there you saw the Bride of God
[2:06:19] Lucifer kicked out saw the Capone C up
[2:06:23] the of their lives saw them grown into
[2:06:26] the image of the Son of God hallelujah
[2:06:28] there was a shout in heaven a shout of
[2:06:30] Victory like never before and that's
[2:06:34] where the first holy convocation took
[2:06:36] place that's that where the eternity
[2:06:39] holy convocation took place it was it
[2:06:41] was celebrating a victory he was
[2:06:43] celebrating a Deliverance he was
[2:06:45] celebrating a victory over Satan over
[2:06:48] Lucifer and all his works oh glory to
[2:06:52] God amen amen amen oh
[2:06:57] brother brother
[2:07:00] amen Oh Glory so what happened
[2:07:05] now what happened now the power that
[2:07:09] cast Lucifer out is the same power that
[2:07:12] came down on day
[2:07:14] one I said let there be light there was
[2:07:17] Darkness repres like Lucifer again let
[2:07:19] there be
[2:07:21] light and there was light and that power
[2:07:25] separated the light from the darkness
[2:07:27] they can't coexist together in a holy
[2:07:30] convocation Darkness cannot coexist with
[2:07:32] light in a holy convocation the sin and
[2:07:36] the debuchy cannot live in your life
[2:07:39] they cannot do it amen the power of God
[2:07:44] will run through your life and the devil
[2:07:48] cannot stand it the devil cannot stand
[2:07:50] in the picture he not even in the
[2:07:52] picture oh hallelujah what shall we then
[2:07:56] say to these things if God be for us who
[2:08:00] can be against us you answer that for
[2:08:03] yourself Lucifer could not do it no
[2:08:06] devil is going to be able to do it oh
[2:08:10] Hallelujah so you know what
[2:08:15] happened in heaven you never did it
[2:08:19] you never did it he tried to get you to
[2:08:21] be on his side you never did
[2:08:24] it Hallelujah so how can you do it here
[2:08:27] but when you come on the face of the
[2:08:29] Earth in your day and in your age the
[2:08:32] ignorance your front path your front
[2:08:36] path is what people are looking at
[2:08:38] that's what you are looking at yourself
[2:08:40] but Elohim is not looking at that Elohim
[2:08:44] knows you did not stand with Lucifer
[2:08:46] Elohim knows Lucifer could not deceive
[2:08:50] you Elohim knows your future is already
[2:08:54] history Elohim knows you have already
[2:08:56] been formed into the word image of the
[2:08:59] Son of God Elohim knows that Elohim
[2:09:02] knows you are loaded with power and time
[2:09:05] holy ghost power and no devil can stand
[2:09:08] before you Elohim knows
[2:09:12] that and that's why he call a holy
[2:09:15] convocation for you to know that and
[2:09:18] experience that yourself so what do we
[2:09:20] find friends you may be see as I'm
[2:09:23] closing out here glory to God
