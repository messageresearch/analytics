[1:09:01] 12 reading from Philippians 2 and we'll
[1:09:07] come back to proverbs chapter 4 reading
[1:09:11] from Isaiah 55

[1:09:27] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:09:30] are your ways my ways saith the Lord for
[1:09:35] as the heavens are higher than the earth
[1:09:37] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[1:09:40] my thoughts and your thoughts reading
[1:09:44] Romans 12 and reading from verse 2
[1:09:50] Romans 12 and reading verse 2 and be not
[1:09:58] conformed to this world but be
[1:10:02] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:10:04] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:10:08] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:10:13] and reading from Philippians chapter 2
[1:10:19] and reading verse 5 Philippians chapter
[1:10:24] 2 reading verse 5 let this mind be in
[1:10:29] you which was also in Christ Jesus and
[1:10:34] our last reading will be from the book
[1:10:37] of Proverbs chapter 4 hear ye children
[1:10:42] the instruction of a father and attend
[1:10:46] to no understanding for I give you good
[1:10:50] doctrine for sake he not my law for I
[1:10:54] was my father's son tender and only
[1:10:57] beloved in the sight of my mother

[1:11:27] wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:11:30] understanding exalt her and she shall

[1:12:03] shall not stumble take fast hall of
[1:12:06] instructions let her not go keep off or
[1:12:09] she is thy life
[1:12:10] may the Lord and a blessing to the
[1:12:13] reading of his word he may be seated
[1:12:15] this morning a man we're so happy to be
[1:12:19] here this morning in the presence of the
[1:12:22] Lord and we had a really tremendous time
[1:12:26] in the youth service yesterday for those
[1:12:29] who missed it the young people and by
[1:12:32] extension the church is welcome to join
[1:12:34] the young people we are in the book of
[1:12:36] Proverbs and the young people stood up
[1:12:39] yesterday and made a commitment before
[1:12:41] God to study the entire book of Proverbs
[1:12:45] during the remain of this year during
[1:12:47] this October November and December was
[1:12:49] the left of 2018
[1:12:50] to study in depth the book of Proverbs
[1:12:53] and we spend some time going through
[1:12:56] proverbs 1 and it was really a
[1:12:59] tremendous time and over the last few
[1:13:03] weeks or so I've been meditating not
[1:13:06] just on proverbs but on the magnitude of
[1:13:09] the wisdom of God and the understanding
[1:13:13] of God and the knowledge of God and what
[1:13:15] God requires from us and for what it
[1:13:18] takes for us to be compatible with him
[1:13:21] and we'll go to some quotes from the
[1:13:22] Prophet but I do have a thought this
[1:13:24] morning title and my title is knowledge
[1:13:29] understanding and wisdom part 1
[1:13:33] knowledge understanding and wisdom part
[1:13:39] 1 now we know that God is a spirit and
[1:13:43] because God is a spirit
[1:13:46] he has to find a way to introduce
[1:13:49] themselves to himself to us so that we
[1:13:53] could relate so when God speaks the man
[1:13:56] or comes to meet man or uses examples of
[1:13:59] man he has to find a way to almost break
[1:14:03] it down to us because he is bigger than
[1:14:05] our understanding he said my thoughts
[1:14:08] are not your thoughts tear down my ways
[1:14:10] your way as far as the heavens are
[1:14:11] higher than here it saw my thoughts I
[1:14:13] had and your thoughts and we have talked
[1:14:15] many times about this great omnipotent
[1:14:17] omniscient all-powerful God who had this
[1:14:21] great desire to reveal himself so true
[1:14:24] all the ages he could have only revealed
[1:14:27] himself in part so he was partly
[1:14:29] expressing himself as Abraham he was
[1:14:32] partly expressing himself through Joshua
[1:14:34] he was partly expressing himself through
[1:14:38] David he was partly expressing
[1:14:40] themselves realiza he was partly
[1:14:43] expressing himself through Isaiah he was
[1:14:46] partly expressing himself through
[1:14:48] Habakkuk he was partly expressing
[1:14:50] himself through JoEllen every prophet
[1:14:53] every man of God that was touching your
[1:14:55] Testament was merely a shadow was merely
[1:14:59] a piece of this great puzzle so to speak
[1:15:02] this great mystery that was God he could
[1:15:05] not ever feel himself all at once
[1:15:07] because it would have been too much he
[1:15:08] had to take time and he had to use
[1:15:10] different people at different times to
[1:15:13] reveal himself can the church say man
[1:15:19] but when we talk about the mind of God
[1:15:22] going to use a lot of examples he said
[1:15:25] the heaven is my throne any earth is my
[1:15:27] footstool because he knows we can relate
[1:15:29] to a throne and a footstool she uses the
[1:15:32] examples that are near to us can the
[1:15:35] church amen
[1:15:36] that we can relate to so he said when
[1:15:38] the angel came in revelation 10 he said
[1:15:40] his face was as it were the son it
[1:15:44] doesn't mean his face was a son it was
[1:15:45] as it were his son because God knows you
[1:15:48] could relate to a son
[1:15:49] you know what a son looks like sup he's
[1:15:51] using examples he's using analogies he's
[1:15:55] using parables to try to take this great
[1:15:58] majesty of God and break it down to our
[1:16:00] understanding can the church say man
[1:16:05] everybody with me this morning don't
[1:16:08] worry this morning we're gonna have Sun
[1:16:09] near school so relax we're gonna have
[1:16:14] Sunday school this morning we're gonna
[1:16:16] go back to ABC's this morning for the
[1:16:18] young people who were here it's gonna be
[1:16:20] a revision of what we did yesterday and
[1:16:23] for those who were not here you'd be a a
[1:16:24] wonderful time so you're gonna have a
[1:16:26] wonderful time together this morning
[1:16:27] have a chance amen but we here by this
[1:16:32] mind of Christ and we read the scripture
[1:16:35] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:16:37] in Christ Jesus and Peter conformed to
[1:16:40] this world but be transformed by the
[1:16:42] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:16:44] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:16:47] perfect will of God
[1:16:48] can the church say man but there's
[1:16:51] something about his mind this great mind
[1:16:53] of God that he could even see there be
[1:16:56] some people who could have the mind of
[1:16:58] Christ that's a powerful statement when
[1:17:01] we talk about the mind of Christ
[1:17:04] we're not talking about the biological
[1:17:05] construction so we're not talking about
[1:17:08] a frontal lobe or pituitary gland or the
[1:17:11] amygdala it's something greater than
[1:17:13] biology we're not talking about the
[1:17:15] chemical mind of God the neural
[1:17:17] electrical synapses we are talking
[1:17:20] greater than chemistry greater than
[1:17:23] biology we are talking about an eternal
[1:17:25] God finding a way to press himself into
[1:17:30] what would seem to normal beings but the
[1:17:33] only way they could be a compatible or a
[1:17:36] transfer is because we could be eternal
[1:17:38] also in fact we are also trapped in time
[1:17:43] had it not been that we bypass the
[1:17:45] theophany
[1:17:46] we would have understood more than we
[1:17:48] understand we wouldn't know more than we
[1:17:50] know but God allowed us to bypass off
[1:17:53] the opening to come down and sit on
[1:17:55] either
[1:17:56] to prove to the devil despite our
[1:17:59] sickness despite our pains despite our
[1:18:03] tiredness despite our depression despite
[1:18:07] what we go through the attribute of God
[1:18:10] that is invisible to the human eye is
[1:18:12] greater than the problems that we face
[1:18:15] and the sufferings of this present time
[1:18:18] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:18:21] glory which shall be revealed in us and
[1:18:24] I get a witness in the house tonight and
[1:18:30] the church say man oh so we're going
[1:18:34] back to basics because we are a word
[1:18:36] church and a word church means we are
[1:18:39] peace in the Holy Scriptures and the
[1:18:41] revealed word has brought by a seventh
[1:18:43] angel messenger right as time the right
[1:18:47] hand of God
[1:18:48] oh who brought a message to bring
[1:18:50] clarity to the areas that seem blurry in
[1:18:53] Scripture God was taking no chances to
[1:18:56] leave it up to our interpretation so he
[1:18:59] sent a prophet up to make sure that you
[1:19:02] know who you are you know what you are
[1:19:04] born to do you know what you are born to
[1:19:07] accomplish and the devil cannot deceive
[1:19:11] you because you have a confidence not in
[1:19:14] yourself but a confidence in God a
[1:19:17] confidence not because you're a church
[1:19:19] member but our confidence in the DNA in
[1:19:22] the attribute in the woods seed in your
[1:19:24] soul because when the Benham taught us
[1:19:27] you are not even a believer but the word
[1:19:29] seed in you
[1:19:30] that's the believer and that believer in
[1:19:32] you that would see cannot get tired that
[1:19:35] word seed in your soul I don't get the
[1:19:38] press up that word seed in your soul
[1:19:40] Jesus was tired and aborted but when
[1:19:43] they walked Jesus up the genetic holder
[1:19:46] the power that was locked up even though
[1:19:49] he was asleep and cousin that help but
[1:19:51] express itself the same peace be still
[1:19:53] or somebody help me preacher spawning
[1:19:59] hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a
[1:20:03] shout of praise you're not gonna get
[1:20:05] nothing unless you're in his spirit oh
[1:20:08] and John said oh he was caught up in the
[1:20:11] spirit so we want to be in a spirit this
[1:20:13] morning because we want to catch the
[1:20:16] mind of God we want to have his fault
[1:20:18] you want to think his thoughts
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:26] oh my feels good this morning feels like
[1:20:31] something that's happening this morning

[1:20:35] supposed to be invisible to the naked
[1:20:37] eye mahalo lujah and if you're not
[1:20:39] seeing something this morning you need
[1:20:41] to open up your eyes and small them to
[1:20:43] see that they are more fighting against

[1:22:18] Christ being you that's what we're
[1:22:21] talking about we're talking about change
[1:22:23] of thinking let that mind it is
[1:22:26] impossible for the mind of Christ to be
[1:22:29] in you and you operate the same way that
[1:22:31] you did yesterday somebody preach back
[1:22:34] to me oh when we are born we are born
[1:22:36] with our own thinking we are born with
[1:22:39] our own understanding Paul said when I
[1:22:41] was a child I spake as a child I
[1:22:43] understood as a child when I became a
[1:22:46] man that becoming a man was not just in
[1:22:49] natural age it was the maturity that
[1:22:52] comes with being a man he said I put
[1:22:54] away the choice things up but when you
[1:22:57] come into Christ you are thinking like a
[1:22:59] baby you are speaking like a baby but we
[1:23:02] are called to maturity and the moment
[1:23:04] your you become and someone you think
[1:23:06] like him and someone you speak like him
[1:23:08] and some more you walk like him somebody
[1:23:14] preached back to me you may be seated
[1:23:18] now the mind is what controls your body
[1:23:20] your hand does nothing unless your mind
[1:23:23] does it everybody with me for your feet
[1:23:28] to move your brain must send an
[1:23:30] instruction so your behavior the moment
[1:23:33] your mind changes your behavior changes
[1:23:36] when you feel in your foot walking into
[1:23:38] places you shouldn't go the problem is

[1:26:15] of God in one service this might be a
[1:26:19] chilly on 65 pass series I don't know
[1:26:21] because God is infinite there is no
[1:26:24] limit to what he could do there was not
[1:26:26] a little bit of his knowledge there's no
[1:26:28] limit of is understanding there's no
[1:26:30] limit of his wisdom able to reach you in
[1:26:32] your situation I don't know how we can
[1:26:34] preach about this in one service it's
[1:26:36] everyday we can talk about how his grace
[1:26:39] how he understood how God to not depend
[1:26:43] on anybody drop down from eternity to
[1:26:48] step in the time to feel what it is to
[1:26:51] be hungry to feel what it is to be tired
[1:26:54] we get an understanding of what it is
[1:26:58] when you're tired and he gave
[1:27:00] understanding of what it is when you are
[1:27:02] hungry could Anita be touched by the
[1:27:05] feeling of our infirmities honey can I
[1:27:07] tell if I owe somebody help me this
[1:27:10] morning everything that you go through
[1:27:20] he went through tiredness he went
[1:27:34] through there's nothing that you could
[1:27:36] ever go through that he is not taking
[1:27:39] Elijah's word for it he's not taking
[1:27:41] Moses his word for it he went through it
[1:27:44] himself so he understands he's a friend
[1:27:47] of a wounded heart because his heart was
[1:27:49] wounded somebody helped me this morning
[1:27:53] he know what it is when friends betray
[1:27:56] him
[1:27:59] he had expected more of pizza but Peter
[1:28:02] went to sleep
[1:28:03] couldn't you watch with me for one hour
[1:28:06] he knows what it is and it is with that
[1:28:12] knowledge and with it is with that
[1:28:14] understanding and it is with that wisdom
[1:28:17] that he puts things in place not based
[1:28:20] on what you will want but what you need
[1:28:22] or somebody helped me this morning so
[1:28:30] I'm not preaching this morning we have a
[1:28:41] Sunday school this morning
[1:28:47] have your Bibles gonna touch a little
[1:28:51] bit of an exercise with Abel to young
[1:28:52] people yesterday proverbs chapter one
[1:29:00] from verse one proverbs chapter one and
[1:29:07] verse one the Proverbs of Solomon the
[1:29:10] son of David king of Israel to know
[1:29:14] wisdom and instruction to perceive the
[1:29:18] words of understanding to receive the
[1:29:22] instruction of wisdom justice and
[1:29:25] judgment and equity to give certainty
[1:29:29] that is simple to the young man
[1:29:31] knowledge and discretion and the
[1:29:35] scripture begins to help us a wise man
[1:29:37] will hear and will increase learning so
[1:29:41] one of the attributes of a wise man is
[1:29:44] that he will hear I will increase
[1:29:45] learning and a man of understanding
[1:29:47] shall attain unto wise counsels to
[1:29:52] understand a proverb and the
[1:29:54] interpretation the words of the wise and
[1:29:57] their dark sayings now I wanna focus on
[1:30:00] the scripture here as I did with young
[1:30:01] people the fear of the Lord is the
[1:30:05] beginning of knowledge
[1:30:07] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:30:10] I want to read it one more time
[1:30:12] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:30:16] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[1:30:20] instruction and I've been meditating on
[1:30:23] this structure we spend some time on it
[1:30:25] with young people yesterday because
[1:30:27] we're speaking about knowledge
[1:30:29] understanding and wisdom you cannot have
[1:30:33] wisdom without knowledge because wisdom
[1:30:37] is the application of knowledge there
[1:30:41] are people who have knowledge and no
[1:30:43] understanding so true out proverbs and
[1:30:48] throughout the scriptures when you read
[1:30:50] it to Bible speaks of three things
[1:30:51] knowledge understanding and wisdom and
[1:30:54] it's all connected
[1:30:55] and we read the scripture in Proverbs
[1:30:58] that the principal thing is wisdom and
[1:31:01] even when Paul speaks of the nine
[1:31:03] spiritual gifts he speaks of wisdom
[1:31:06] being the first of the spiritual gifts
[1:31:08] and the church say man so you have to
[1:31:11] have understanding you have to have
[1:31:13] knowledge now knowledge is knowing so
[1:31:18] you can know something I not understand
[1:31:20] so you know that if you put something
[1:31:22] here and let it go it falls and not
[1:31:25] understand that why it's falling so you
[1:31:29] know it falls and then understanding
[1:31:31] tells you there's a law of gravity and
[1:31:33] no wisdom is how do you apply the this
[1:31:37] knowledge and understanding you have so
[1:31:39] that if someone is down nearly need to
[1:31:41] trust something you have the confidence
[1:31:43] that you could throw it and this law of
[1:31:45] gravity will work on that object and
[1:31:47] ensure that it doesn't go up but it will
[1:31:51] go down because you have an
[1:31:53] understanding based on the knowledge
[1:31:54] that if you let something go it will
[1:31:56] fall that is knowledge understanding and
[1:31:58] wisdom working together come to church
[1:32:03] amen
[1:32:04] and then suddenly we're all like getting
[1:32:07] get understanding so there are a lot of
[1:32:09] people who come to church and they have
[1:32:11] knowledge in those scriptures but they
[1:32:12] have no understanding and they have no
[1:32:16] wisdom of how to apply the word in the
[1:32:18] daily lives and that's what our
[1:32:20] questions just want him to understand
[1:32:22] all to apply it but if the beginning is
[1:32:24] knowledge then the scripture goes deeper
[1:32:27] and says the beginning of knowledge is
[1:32:30] the fear of the Lord the beginning of
[1:32:34] knowledge is not algebra and geometry
[1:32:36] and geography and how to tie your
[1:32:40] shoelaces and how to say good morning
[1:32:42] the beginning of knowledge is the fear
[1:32:45] of the Lord the fear of the Lord is what
[1:32:50] makes you come to church the fear of the
[1:32:53] Lord is what makes you reverent the fear
[1:32:56] of the Lord is what lets you know that
[1:32:58] the consequences of action of sinful
[1:33:01] action will be dead that's the fear of
[1:33:04] the Lord and we Cheryl young people
[1:33:08] yesterday that when you go into a
[1:33:11] courtroom you have to dress a certain
[1:33:14] way you have to address the judge a
[1:33:16] certain way because there's a fear of
[1:33:18] the judge in his courtroom it's fear a
[1:33:22] control that behavior and as we mature
[1:33:26] as Christian God wants a relationship to
[1:33:28] evolve from fear to one of love because
[1:33:32] God doesn't want you here this morning
[1:33:33] because you saw afraid Lord I hear no
[1:33:35] well you see I become frightened that's
[1:33:38] not the desired relationship he wants
[1:33:40] you here because of love so it's a
[1:33:42] spectrum the beginning of knowledge is
[1:33:44] fear the fear of the Lord not just fear
[1:33:47] but the fear of Lord is the beginning of
[1:33:49] knowledge later on and I think problems
[1:33:52] 90 said the fear of the Lord is the
[1:33:53] beginning of wisdom won't you so the
[1:33:56] foundation of your walk is the fear of
[1:33:58] the Lord the fear the Lord is what makes
[1:34:01] you reverence your parents honor your
[1:34:04] mother and father it's the fear of the
[1:34:06] Lord that TV that's in your soul it's
[1:34:08] because you fear the Lord you want to
[1:34:11] worship come on now it's a fear the Lord
[1:34:15] that brought you to church this morning
[1:34:17] it's the fear of the Lord that drives
[1:34:19] you to his word it's a fear the Lord
[1:34:22] that makes you want to forgive it's a
[1:34:24] fear the Lord that drives you to drop
[1:34:26] your arts it's the fear of the Lord that
[1:34:29] makes you want
[1:34:29] love your name I love your brother
[1:34:31] because you know God is watching you
[1:34:33] know he is all-powerful you know when
[1:34:35] you apply yourself it's a fear of the
[1:34:37] Lord that keeps you when you're in your
[1:34:39] workplace when you're in your school
[1:34:40] when you're driving on the road you know
[1:34:43] there's something greater than yourself
[1:34:45] of course that's awesome my god that's
[1:34:47] powerful the corner opened the Red Sea
[1:34:50] he's not God to be played with he's not
[1:34:52] God to be trifled with
[1:34:53] he's an oh come on somebody help me this
[1:34:56] morning we share with young people
[1:35:01] people fear the police they be there
[1:35:04] they feared judges and a Fiat gangsters
[1:35:06] and they don't want to fear the Lord
[1:35:07] because the perception is you can't see
[1:35:10] this gold but you can see the police you
[1:35:11] can see the gangsters but this God is a
[1:35:13] core of the invisible and he's an
[1:35:15] all-powerful God and the fear of the
[1:35:17] Lord is the beginning of understanding
[1:35:20] the beginning of knowledge the beginning
[1:35:23] of wisdom so let this man I was in
[1:35:26] Christ being you God want you to have
[1:35:29] godly knowledge godly understanding and
[1:35:32] godly wisdom wisdom to know how to act
[1:35:36] when tat wisdom to put your knowledge of
[1:35:39] what you have heard all these years in
[1:35:41] the message into your practical living
[1:35:42] what good is it to come to church and go
[1:35:45] back home
[1:35:45] and not know how to apply it he said if
[1:35:47] any man lack wisdom let him ask for it
[1:35:51] can the church say man everybody feeling
[1:35:54] fine this morning so called in His grace
[1:35:57] and His mercy and in his wisdom and in
[1:35:59] his knowledge because it's by
[1:36:00] foreknowledge he's able to produce
[1:36:02] tonight there is no extension of his
[1:36:05] knowledge God already knows everything
[1:36:07] and listen to this this quest for wisdom
[1:36:10] we share with young people yesterday but
[1:36:12] the Brenham said that Eve was looking
[1:36:15] for three things in the message I want
[1:36:20] to read it here in a message the spoken
[1:36:23] word is the original seed but I've
[1:36:25] answered and Jesus coming was that seat
[1:36:27] he proved it everything that Adam lost
[1:36:30] Jesus was see he is the correct even
[1:36:34] listen would have finally brought that
[1:36:36] child forth but she hybrid it
[1:36:38] brought a soupçon in listening for
[1:36:40] wisdom understanding knowledge so these
[1:36:46] three things we are speaking about
[1:36:47] because what did the serpent tell you if
[1:36:49] you take of this fruit you'll be wise
[1:36:52] so it means Eve and Adam in the garden
[1:36:57] were being presented with a higher level
[1:37:00] of wisdom by the serpent and when you go
[1:37:04] through the scripture you see God having
[1:37:06] this war between the knowledge of man
[1:37:08] and his knowledge the understanding of
[1:37:10] man and his understanding and the wisdom
[1:37:12] of man and his own wisdom is when I read
[1:37:16] a quote and we've touched on a few
[1:37:17] things in the message Seaton's eaten by
[1:37:19] the basket God needs no interpreter he
[1:37:22] does his own interpreting he doesn't
[1:37:24] need anyone else to tell him how to do
[1:37:26] it he is sovereign he said how he would
[1:37:29] do it and that's the way we he must keep
[1:37:31] his word when he said these signs shall
[1:37:33] follow them that believe he meant just
[1:37:35] that whatever he said was he pleased he
[1:37:38] said it would happen in these last days
[1:37:40] that he would do certain things and he
[1:37:42] done it he has to ask nobody whether
[1:37:45] it's time or not he knows what time is
[1:37:48] and what the plan is kind of church say
[1:37:50] ma'am you believe that this morning now
[1:37:53] Satan this deceiver I spoke up in
[1:37:56] Matthew 24:24 with some urgency now we
[1:37:59] find that by His gospel programs of
[1:38:01] knowledge better education higher ethics
[1:38:05] civilization and so forth has bewitched
[1:38:08] the people at once to serve God into
[1:38:10] believing his life even did not want to
[1:38:14] do that but he showed her how it was
[1:38:16] more wisdom in it she didn't know she
[1:38:19] wanted to know she didn't understand but
[1:38:22] she wanted to understand that's the
[1:38:25] prophets words now I'm caught hold her
[1:38:27] not to try to understand how can I
[1:38:30] understand any of these things I want
[1:38:31] you to understand that this issue of
[1:38:33] knowledge knowledge increases that's it
[1:38:37] we live they will knowledge increase
[1:38:39] people know so much that they don't want
[1:38:41] to know about God anymore
[1:38:42] they know how to take this medication I
[1:38:45] try this medication knowledge has
[1:38:47] increased till they can explain away
[1:38:49] everything and try to explain
[1:38:51] even God but God has his knowledge as
[1:38:54] greater than that and his understanding
[1:38:57] is greater than that and his wisdom that
[1:38:59] all together forms a mind of Christ the
[1:39:02] mind of God the thoughts of God to drop
[1:39:05] down in a people so that he will only do
[1:39:07] his will and they will take no thought
[1:39:10] of what they will see because they'll be
[1:39:12] thinking his thoughts come to a man and
[1:39:17] there many course I'm gonna skip them
[1:39:19] but but a man said if you really want if
[1:39:21] you really read the Bible with spiritual
[1:39:23] understanding
[1:39:24] so there's spiritual understanding not
[1:39:26] just natural understanding but spiritual
[1:39:28] understanding get in love with the
[1:39:29] writer then you can read between the
[1:39:33] lines and see where God pulls it out so
[1:39:36] God wants us to have spiritual knowledge
[1:39:38] spiritual understanding spiritual wisdom
[1:39:42] now wisdom is doing the greatest goal in
[1:39:46] any situation and the best way to
[1:39:48] achieve it wisdom is different from
[1:39:51] knowledge you can have knowledge without
[1:39:52] wisdom there are lot of brilliant fools
[1:39:59] but you cannot have wisdom without
[1:40:01] knowledge because in order to discern
[1:40:04] the best way to achieve something you
[1:40:06] have to be able to integrate to fuse
[1:40:09] together all kinds of factors from
[1:40:11] various sources of knowledge and
[1:40:13] experience David and Sam's 147 5 said
[1:40:19] his understanding is infinite so there's
[1:40:22] no limit to his understanding jeremiah
[1:40:26] was praising to the great and mighty god
[1:40:28] whose name is the lord of hosts the one
[1:40:31] grid in council and mighty indeed whose
[1:40:35] eyes are on all the ways of the sons of
[1:40:38] men in order to give to each person
[1:40:40] according to his ways and the result of
[1:40:43] his deeds when daniel described god's
[1:40:46] wisdom he wrote he changes the times and
[1:40:49] seasons he removes kings and establishes
[1:40:52] kings he gives wisdom to the wise and
[1:40:54] knowledge that those who have
[1:40:56] understanding he reveals the deep and he
[1:40:59] had hidden things he's knows
[1:41:01] is in the tactics and the light dwells
[1:41:03] with him and that's the mind that God
[1:41:06] wants inside of us so to God there's no
[1:41:09] mystery there's no puzzle to God God is
[1:41:12] never surprised because he has all
[1:41:14] knowledge he has all understanding he
[1:41:17] has all wisdom so what you are going
[1:41:19] through this morning is no surprise to
[1:41:21] God he knows what you're going through
[1:41:23] he understand what you're going through
[1:41:25] and he's wise enough to have you go
[1:41:28] through your trial to go to your task to
[1:41:31] develop the character they develop the
[1:41:33] life of God in you Oh hallelujah
[1:41:37] somebody say man we have in Sunday's
[1:41:41] hulis morning when Paul tries to speak
[1:41:44] up the wisdom of God he moves into
[1:41:46] praises all the depths of the riches
[1:41:49] both of the wisdom and knowledge of God
[1:41:51] how unsearchable his judgments and
[1:41:54] untraceable his ways for who has known
[1:41:58] the mind of the Lord or who has ever has
[1:42:00] been his counselor or who has ever first
[1:42:03] given to him and has to be repaid for
[1:42:06] from him and through him and to him are
[1:42:10] all things to him be the glory forever
[1:42:12] that's from Romans 11 I want to read
[1:42:14] that one more time can I do so Paul says
[1:42:17] all the depth of the riches both of the
[1:42:21] wisdom he said but greater riches of
[1:42:24] course wisdom and the knowledge of God
[1:42:26] how unsearchable his judgments and
[1:42:29] untraceable his ways for who has known
[1:42:32] the mind of the Lord or who has been his
[1:42:34] counselor or who has ever first given to
[1:42:37] him and has been has to be repaired for
[1:42:41] from him and through him and to him are
[1:42:44] all things to him be the glory forever
[1:42:46] in other words the Apostle Paul is
[1:42:49] seeing God's wisdom is so deep that his
[1:42:52] judgments are unsearchable in other
[1:42:54] words I can't get to tear from here
[1:42:56] God's wisdom is sudeep's his ways are
[1:42:59] untraceable I can't follow all of what
[1:43:02] he's doing
[1:43:02] without being hopelessly over my head it
[1:43:05] is so deep that there's nobody who could
[1:43:07] give him advice because there's no
[1:43:09] advisor could advise him because his
[1:43:11] knowledge is so great
[1:43:13] understanding is so deepest wisdom is so
[1:43:15] profound he doesn't need to talk to your
[1:43:18] neighbor or your father or the pastor or
[1:43:20] anybody to bless you he could do what he
[1:43:22] wants to do Oh kinda church came in this
[1:43:28] morning can you trust the God who has
[1:43:31] all that knowledge can you trust a God
[1:43:33] who is all an understanding can you
[1:43:35] trust the God was all that wisdom so
[1:43:38] what are you complaining about what are
[1:43:40] you crying about what trial are you
[1:43:42] going through that court doesn't know
[1:43:44] about that court doesn't understand that
[1:43:46] court in its wisdom has sent you're way
[1:43:48] too perfect you can the church cement
[1:43:52] somebody give God a soda praise the
[1:44:00] wisdom of God is so deep and so
[1:44:03] expansive that he cannot even increase
[1:44:06] his wisdom I'll seal it again his wisdom
[1:44:11] is so deep and so expansive he cannot
[1:44:13] even increase his wisdom the only way
[1:44:19] God can increases wisdom if there was
[1:44:21] such a thing is if something as a
[1:44:23] comment of course a mind that hasn't
[1:44:25] thought about already but that's
[1:44:27] impossible
[1:44:31] so Yui can wine me why this why that
[1:44:34] causes already thought about intelligent
[1:44:36] seamen so cause actions are always
[1:44:41] perfectly wise there's no upgrading of
[1:44:44] his wisdom and the church seaman so he
[1:44:50] knows exactly where you are this morning
[1:44:51] he knows where your son is he knows
[1:44:54] where your daughter is he knows what's
[1:44:56] going on and all things will work
[1:44:58] together for good to them that love God
[1:45:01] answered my be called according to his
[1:45:04] purpose
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:16] seaman Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:45:24] everybody feelin fine so we are building
[1:45:27] just something the internal eternal
[1:45:30] thoughts of God the difference between
[1:45:32] the way we think and the way that God
[1:45:35] things for us to change our prayer life
[1:45:37] we have to think differently about our
[1:45:39] prayer life for us to change the way we
[1:45:41] study we have to think differently about
[1:45:42] the importance of study God has to shock
[1:45:45] us and reboot us to think like him
[1:45:47] because even Jesus had to pray so
[1:45:52] there's no way of passing or bypassing
[1:45:54] him there's no way out of it Josh I was
[1:45:56] taught some merit it on the word day and
[1:45:57] night to have good success there's no
[1:45:59] bypassing that core it is knowledge
[1:46:02] already put that there for us and you
[1:46:03] know it but do you really understand it
[1:46:06] and we really apply it because if every
[1:46:08] day you're not praying and studying then
[1:46:10] you are still in the state of knowledge
[1:46:11] and it hasn't dropped into understanding
[1:46:14] because if you really understand that
[1:46:16] the devil has his eyes shift you like
[1:46:18] wheat but God has prayed for you and
[1:46:20] that he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:46:22] left a realm of glory to come to us you
[1:46:26] know this but when you understand it it
[1:46:28] makes you so grateful that you can't
[1:46:31] help but a worshiper you can't help but
[1:46:33] shout you know this but when you really
[1:46:35] understand that His grace is sufficient
[1:46:39] how can you be sad how can you be
[1:46:42] depressed
[1:46:43] how can you be frustrated that man who
[1:46:49] came to the prophet and the Prophet
[1:46:51] prayed for him he was a blind man and he
[1:46:56] came to the line they probably paid him
[1:46:58] and he went back and he didn't receive
[1:47:00] his sight he came back to the Prophet to
[1:47:02] probably see he already healed he nor
[1:47:06] the Prophet said it but he didn't really
[1:47:07] understand it he said go and sell a
[1:47:10] newspaper and say extra extra read all
[1:47:12] about it by stripes I'm healed
[1:47:14] something was waited a truck from
[1:47:16] knowledge understanding become way when
[1:47:18] it becomes an understanding to you
[1:47:19] nobody could cut could convince you
[1:47:21] otherwise do you understand that his
[1:47:24] blood he had already here you caught is
[1:47:26] not no healing he's not now calling he's
[1:47:29] not now Crete estimating it's already
[1:47:31] done you can hear it with head knowledge
[1:47:33] but when you really understand it
[1:47:36] brother
[1:47:36] it changes your walk up it changes your
[1:47:39] talk it changes your life it changes
[1:47:42] your expectation hallelujah my mind in
[1:47:55] the exposition the seven churches we
[1:47:57] read this quote before the eternal
[1:47:59] thoughts of God let me ask you other
[1:48:02] thoughts of God eternal if you can see
[1:48:04] this you will see many things God is
[1:48:06] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:48:08] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:48:11] that already God is infinite in his
[1:48:13] abilities so therefore he as God must be
[1:48:16] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:48:20] is not now learning not is he taking
[1:48:23] counsel even with himself we read that
[1:48:26] before so Court is it even
[1:48:27] second-guessing himself I wonder why I
[1:48:29] do that we do that I wonder where I put
[1:48:31] you think I wonder why I did it that's
[1:48:33] why I remember why I will put that there
[1:48:35] that's you taking conser with yourself
[1:48:38] but God does not take counsel with
[1:48:40] himself or anybody else can the church
[1:48:43] say man no is he at anytime
[1:48:46] adding to his knowledge so there's
[1:48:49] nothing you have ever done or whatever -
[1:48:50] that is
[1:48:51] new knowledge to court because he's can
[1:48:53] eternity to Eternity and his
[1:48:56] foreknowledge which is all knowledge saw
[1:48:59] you and found you in Mara Valentino
[1:49:02] Matalin suddenly blended you saw your
[1:49:05] grandfather your great-grandfather we
[1:49:07] saw the whole genealogy and he waited
[1:49:10] patiently so when you were being born
[1:49:12] for the Spirit of God to drop up up that
[1:49:15] put place because it was a scene that he
[1:49:19] pleased in there by his foreknowledge he
[1:49:22] predestinated you when your mama was
[1:49:25] carrying you she didn't even know what
[1:49:27] she was carrying but he knew what
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:38] hallelujah
[1:49:39] you may be seated the problem is most of
[1:49:42] us are suing a natural that we don't
[1:49:44] understand the eternal things of God
[1:49:46] when John was right in the book of
[1:49:50] Revelation he said he even looked and he
[1:49:52] turned to the angel who was revealing
[1:49:54] all these things to him
[1:49:55] can the church say man in revelation 22
[1:49:58] and he said I was about to bow at the
[1:50:00] feet of this angel with a showed me to
[1:50:03] sing John was so awed by the ministry of
[1:50:06] this angel that he made a mistake and he
[1:50:10] wanted to worship this angel because he
[1:50:13] told his angel had to be the Covenant he
[1:50:14] enjoyed he told it in turn had to be the
[1:50:16] user of the Lord because he couldn't
[1:50:17] understand which other angel could
[1:50:19] reveal such great mysteries and when he
[1:50:22] started about this angel this is wrong
[1:50:25] 1895 he was there speaking the charge
[1:50:28] when John was here and this intercept
[1:50:30] don't power down because I am of the
[1:50:33] service of the prophets worship God and
[1:50:38] this angel ik cousins this angel
[1:50:41] appeared who was not from time but from
[1:50:43] eternity
[1:50:44] went back to where he came from within
[1:50:47] and trucktown again because through a
[1:50:49] prophet message we are made to know that
[1:50:52] that angel is the same angel of Malachi
[1:50:55] 4 5 and 6
[1:50:57] how do you explain it was when a Branham
[1:51:00] sneaking the John how do you explain
[1:51:02] was brother branham speaking of sister
[1:51:04] hottie right how do you explain it's the
[1:51:07] words of a prophet to reach you in 2018
[1:51:10] a star in the right hand of God to bring
[1:51:14] spiritual knowledge to bring spiritual
[1:51:17] understanding to bring spiritual wisdom
[1:51:19] to Tim who are called by his name
[1:51:22] somebody tweets back to me
[1:51:25] somebody say man somebody see hallelujah
[1:51:29] for the knowledge of God put all the
[1:51:32] pieces you could miss this when you fell
[1:51:35] in sin God allowed it to happen we need
[1:51:37] to recognize that you are mortal and you
[1:51:39] were born in sin but when he dropped his
[1:51:41] blood upon you it was meat also
[1:51:43] understand that is a mercy seat and his
[1:51:46] blood on the mercy seat Oh somebody help
[1:51:49] me
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:51:59] so what are you complaining about what
[1:52:07] are you complaining about
[1:52:08] Paul said I find a law when I do good
[1:52:11] evil is present all of these men were
[1:52:14] discovering something all of these men
[1:52:16] caught he hated certain things from them
[1:52:18] because he knows what you could see and
[1:52:20] what you cannot see he knows what you're
[1:52:22] supposed to see and what you're not
[1:52:24] supposed to see he knows why that man
[1:52:26] was sick for 38 years I'm just going to
[1:52:29] the Pool of Bethesda he knows he saw
[1:52:32] every time because then for knowledge
[1:52:34] and the encompassing knowledge of God
[1:52:36] means he knows every movement there's no
[1:52:39] computer in the world like a trap
[1:52:41] everything the way God and he was that
[1:52:44] man in the air one in here too and he
[1:52:47] already knew in the f38 that Jesus would
[1:52:50] be there and it'll be a sign and chorus
[1:52:52] just watching all the pieces move
[1:52:54] together
[1:52:55] listen corazon adjusting and readjusting
[1:52:58] he is just watching because he already
[1:53:00] thought about it he already understands
[1:53:02] it his wisdom supported understanding or
[1:53:05] somebody helped me this morning
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:12] and that's why Satan is mad and that's
[1:53:17] why we didn't know the Prophet spoke
[1:53:18] about the Seventh Seal he said was sad
[1:53:20] because you don't want to see anything
[1:53:22] you have to keep it because if the devil
[1:53:25] found out what it was he would do great
[1:53:28] damage so God had to hold the secret not
[1:53:32] from you but the secret from the devil
[1:53:34] because you know you could even trust
[1:53:36] yourself with some secrets so going up
[1:53:40] to wait till you mature enough to handle
[1:53:43] his kind of secrets I meant to confuse
[1:53:47] everything he said the secret is the
[1:53:50] word is in the pride quat disguise his
[1:53:54] spirit his dynamics in seed form and
[1:53:57] slipped it inside your soul when you
[1:53:59] won't even look him
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:09] and the chats amen you are going to a
[1:54:12] job you in the maxi and Cortez dropping
[1:54:15] secrets to you and how do you know
[1:54:18] because when you come to church no
[1:54:19] matter what you go through and you hear
[1:54:21] the word there's a connection
[1:54:24] listen you can receive anything from God
[1:54:27] unless you speak in his language so when
[1:54:32] the word goes forth even though you may
[1:54:34] be covered in fields covered in sin
[1:54:35] covered in depression
[1:54:37] there's seed in your so seen that's me
[1:54:39] but that's me that's me I'm gonna be
[1:54:43] healed I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna
[1:54:46] have a victory I'm gonna be adopted I'm
[1:54:48] gonna be perfected because your name is
[1:54:52] not but it bounces an almond never is
[1:54:54] another literal name but if the words in
[1:54:56] the book so when the word is reached and
[1:54:59] words perfection you may not have a full
[1:55:01] understanding of it but you know the
[1:55:03] word you know there's something
[1:55:04] connected there you see I think you're
[1:55:06] talking about Mira there's something in
[1:55:09] me crying out for perfection crying out
[1:55:11] for adoption called creation groaning
[1:55:14] travail and wait him a summit to happen
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:22] you may be seated
[1:55:23] that's why the Prophet said when the
[1:55:26] bride gets to know who she is then
[1:55:30] thereafter will go oh my somebody
[1:55:34] feeling fine this morning he enjoying a
[1:55:36] Sunday school this morning
[1:55:38] [Applause]
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:46] hallelujah may God inspire your soul
[1:55:53] today to get spiritual knowledge study
[1:56:02] to show yourself approved to know what
[1:56:05] God rut ground you're standing on and
[1:56:07] you'll find friends the more you spend
[1:56:09] in the wood and in prayer and in fast in
[1:56:13] and in supplication and having a prayer
[1:56:15] life a lot of what bothers you will not
[1:56:19] bother you anymore
[1:56:22] it'll take you to a higher place half of
[1:56:27] your stress IRC on people yesterday if I
[1:56:29] were to order it ordered how many of
[1:56:31] them read their Bibles on three
[1:56:33] everybody last week I didn't want to put
[1:56:35] them on this bus so I'll give him a week
[1:56:40] brother kindly before they retake that
[1:56:41] example because when you read a Bible
[1:56:47] every day and you pray every day you
[1:56:51] will grow when you read a prophets
[1:56:55] message every day you will grow it's
[1:56:58] impossible future go backward if you are
[1:57:02] reading the word and you're praying
[1:57:04] every day I've said many that is
[1:57:06] impossible if you get in an argument
[1:57:08] with your boss knowledge understanding
[1:57:13] and wisdom we share with young people
[1:57:15] people get how could a coconut Christian
[1:57:18] family they had road rage
[1:57:26] how could how could a person ever acted
[1:57:29] at me because my husband did this or
[1:57:31] because my wife did this zone the fear
[1:57:34] of the Lord and his world and the way he
[1:57:38] wants us to operate is what guys our
[1:57:40] behavior it doesn't depend on anybody
[1:57:43] else's behavior the word says do not
[1:57:48] foresee the assembling of yourselves
[1:57:49] together it is not to fear the pastor
[1:57:53] that brings you to church this fear of
[1:57:54] the Lord and the thing of it is brother
[1:58:02] Steven if none of people don't know
[1:58:05] because they had all these things before
[1:58:07] but do you really understand and has it
[1:58:14] become applied in your life as wisdom
[1:58:17] the Bible said be wise as a serpent and
[1:58:19] gentle as a dove children honor your
[1:58:28] parents honor thy father and mother if
[1:58:30] that's just knowledge and it's not an
[1:58:32] understanding you would never do it
[1:58:35] there people who know they're not
[1:58:37] supposed to eat fried foods there's
[1:58:42] nobody in here cut immediate don't know
[1:58:44] fried who's not good
[1:58:51] the people will notice that KFC is not
[1:58:54] good and then you see them in Lyon I
[1:58:57] told you tell me Casey not good I know I
[1:59:03] mean have them to little coca-cola not
[1:59:06] good don't drink something didn't know I
[1:59:08] mission one with another you know coke
[1:59:10] not good and he drinking coke because at
[1:59:18] the knowledge level they're people who
[1:59:23] suffer with high blood pressure they
[1:59:24] don't condone assault Kannamma nice
[1:59:26] although easy so let me sort alone and
[1:59:28] nobody is one pie just one pie is it's
[1:59:32] only knowledge level Sierra from shady
[1:59:39] places you know it is nothing you don't
[1:59:43] know because we're the band said your
[1:59:45] conscience speaks to you and tell if you
[1:59:48] don't do something but whatever you
[1:59:49] reject your voice of your conscience
[1:59:51] after a while but Abraham said you start
[1:59:54] to get you lose his sensitivity and it
[1:59:58] becomes easier and easier for you to do
[2:00:01] foolishness it's not that you don't know
[2:00:03] but when it become an understanding of
[2:00:06] husband love your wives will come on
[2:00:10] somebody please back to me because
[2:00:12] knowing as well anyway understanding it
[2:00:14] because the understanding no means as
[2:00:17] Christ loved the church understanding
[2:00:22] now mean description now comes into
[2:00:23] proper context and wisdom knows how to
[2:00:25] rightly divide it so you know what cross
[2:00:28] in submit submit submits a bit like a
[2:00:32] broken record because you have to deal
[2:00:36] with your wife come on scripture
[2:00:37] according to knowledge see throughout
[2:00:41] scripture knowledge understanding and
[2:00:44] wisdom when those ingredients are
[2:00:46] wrapped together perfectly
[2:00:48] that's how the mind of Christ somebody
[2:00:53] say Amen
[2:00:54] it was God's understanding and his
[2:00:57] knowledge and his wisdom Lord Moses to
[2:00:59] grow up in Egypt
[2:01:01] there's no mysterious to accident so as
[2:01:04] Christians as message Bible believing
[2:01:06] Christians we have to grow in didn't in
[2:01:09] the knowledge of God and the
[2:01:11] understanding of his will for our life
[2:01:13] and you wisdom to know what we are
[2:01:15] supposed to do in the word when the
[2:01:19] seven thunders uttered a voices that
[2:01:21] group who can't eat the world and handed
[2:01:24] their that handing it this application
[2:01:26] that's not knowledge that hand media is
[2:01:30] understanding into wisdom to know what
[2:01:33] to do what he wants done with the word
[2:01:36] and that's what we are contending for
[2:01:40] the faith that was once delivered to the
[2:01:42] scenes where they only said what he
[2:01:45] wanted said or they kept still you could
[2:01:48] have knowledge to let somebody but
[2:01:51] wisdom holds your tongue there are many
[2:01:59] ways to deal with situations if you deal
[2:02:02] with it with knowledge but you did this
[2:02:04] turn God he doesn't deal with us with
[2:02:06] knowledge only because he could say well
[2:02:09] you made this mistake oh you made that
[2:02:10] mistake but his understanding connected
[2:02:14] to wisdom pushes the knowledge of your
[2:02:16] sins under the blood as it is here for
[2:02:18] Catholics
[2:02:20] so when he sees us his understanding and
[2:02:23] wisdom sees through the blood because he
[2:02:25] be keeps bringing up knowledge of your
[2:02:26] mistakes we will never stand a chance
[2:02:27] somebody help me preach this morning you
[2:02:33] have to learn other TV you can't do the
[2:02:35] cheering with knowledge because we don't
[2:02:37] have God's ability to place it in the
[2:02:39] CEO forget it and leave it there we live
[2:02:41] with the knowledge of what people did to
[2:02:43] us but it takes understanding of how
[2:02:46] somebody else feels and the wisdom to
[2:02:48] know how to leave and let things go that
[2:02:54] is the mind of God and what
[2:02:56] distinguishes his thinking from our
[2:02:58] thinking Oh somebody help me preach this
[2:03:02] morning I've heard men and brother see
[2:03:09] you know this men and women anything
[2:03:15] differently you know Mac you forget
[2:03:18] something and then woman a little
[2:03:20] different by George it could be fifteen
[2:03:22] years later and I always a joke when I
[2:03:26] see ah I see it's like they have this
[2:03:26] black book you'd be like yeah and the
[2:03:29] last time you're hot put that in
[2:03:31] nothing it was in 1987 and I told you
[2:03:34] don't put it there
[2:03:36] no that's knowledge maybe not but
[2:03:41] understanding well maybe that would
[2:03:43] wisdom but you have to know how to treat
[2:03:48] the Bible says don't don't don't push it
[2:03:50] children because our I don't want it
[2:03:55] takes wisdom in this day more than ever
[2:03:59] because no it's not understanding and
[2:04:01] wisdom is legalism you know you do this
[2:04:06] you do but but you have to have with all
[2:04:08] that getting get understanding
[2:04:12] understand as a young man you have a
[2:04:14] testimony in your school in your job is
[2:04:17] that this not of all people message
[2:04:23] this is the everybody message when you
[2:04:30] understand and understanding is
[2:04:32] connected to love because when your love
[2:04:35] becomes unconditional for God and
[2:04:38] conditional for your brother for your
[2:04:39] sister it goes because you have to no
[2:04:40] forget certain things
[2:04:43] that's why Pope said do I know all
[2:04:45] things and I don't have charity you
[2:04:48] don't have love do I know all mysteries
[2:04:51] why I keep my baby people and have not
[2:04:53] charity he said with a higher thinking
[2:04:56] I'll be a renewal of mine a
[2:05:00] transformation of your behavior to be
[2:05:02] christ-like not church like but
[2:05:05] christ-like that is what we are here for
[2:05:07] to grow that our behavior change friends
[2:05:14] God isn't measuring us by what we
[2:05:16] profess he's measuring us by what we
[2:05:20] possess and the Perry says out of the
[2:05:22] abundance of your heart the mouth speaks
[2:05:25] so I know what's in your heart by what
[2:05:27] comes out of your mouth or somebody help
[2:05:30] me preach this morning and God puts us
[2:05:36] he said if any man lack wisdom you need
[2:05:39] wisdom to know how to be on your job
[2:05:42] wisdom I don't you deal with your
[2:05:47] journal to dealing with your neighbors
[2:05:49] because your neighbors are looking at
[2:05:51] you you have your knowledge you know any
[2:05:55] word I say it's done about yourself
[2:05:56] you're hidden you here on your hidden
[2:05:58] that's all knowledge no one is signing a
[2:05:59] wisdom
[2:06:02] how could you convince somebody this is
[2:06:04] the right way it buys the approach say
[2:06:10] Lord I want to testify to my neighbor
[2:06:12] and know the scriptures represent but me
[2:06:14] you give me an understanding of their
[2:06:16] situation and the wisdom and how to
[2:06:18] present it to them that they could even
[2:06:21] look beyond my faults and see the wood
[2:06:22] for what it is
[2:06:23] somebody helped me this morning that's
[2:06:26] why the backside here and what if the
[2:06:27] soul is wise
[2:06:31] it doesn't take knowledge to win souls
[2:06:33] or even understanding it takes wisdom to
[2:06:35] put it together to be able to understand
[2:06:38] what somebody's going through and show
[2:06:40] them that there's a better way and Paul
[2:06:42] gave us the best way say follow me as I
[2:06:45] follow Christ so he qualified even his
[2:06:48] own ministry to them the citizen I don't
[2:06:51] want it abyss your feet on my standing
[2:06:53] and by your own testimony my testimony
[2:06:57] is as good as I follow Christ but if I
[2:06:59] ever fall away from following Christ
[2:07:01] keep your eyes on him because he's the
[2:07:03] perfect example he made sure and give
[2:07:06] the right knowledge and his
[2:07:08] understanding of his humaneness
[2:07:10] and the wisdom of how God operates to
[2:07:12] you to put it and rightly divide the
[2:07:14] word clicking of a balance life and the
[2:07:18] church teaming with all night getting
[2:07:20] get understanding better walk a better
[2:07:26] talk a better we have life friends when
[2:07:30] this become a reality to you testifying
[2:07:33] and sharing the goodness of Jesus
[2:07:34] becomes natural because any course of
[2:07:37] them it goes beyond the knowledge of
[2:07:39] Jesus seems to the understand the will
[2:07:41] need salvation and understanding of your
[2:07:45] family needs this I know
[2:07:46] sure releases funny young people who are
[2:07:49] back season it's not knowledge just what
[2:07:50] they need it's an understanding and even
[2:07:54] though they fell His grace is
[2:07:56] self-sufficient there are people who
[2:07:58] know this but I don't understand it
[2:07:59] because when you talk to somebody who is
[2:08:01] struggling this struggle with can I come
[2:08:03] back and the Bible said the way of the
[2:08:06] transgressor is hard so it's not easy
[2:08:08] because it no better
[2:08:10] so God was really really really wants to
[2:08:13] change the life around but it's really
[2:08:15] understand that His grace is sufficient
[2:08:16] and his hand is not too short to reach
[2:08:19] at them and pull them back from the
[2:08:21] clutches of the devil
[2:08:23] and when God does that work of
[2:08:26] transformation for you
[2:08:27] it gives you an understanding to love
[2:08:29] even more than you ever loved before
[2:08:31] [Music]
[2:08:33] that's why when people judge others in
[2:08:36] church you know they haven't had a real
[2:08:37] experience with God
[2:08:39] because if you know what God took you
[2:08:43] and you understand how you have to reach
[2:08:46] the cat you
[2:08:47] it takes you down from that position of
[2:08:50] judgment to an understanding that people
[2:08:53] are impaired they could be in church but
[2:08:55] they're in need they can be coming out
[2:08:57] and smiling but they're in pain Jesus
[2:09:03] when he walk to safety that's how well
[2:09:05] have no need of a physician but I come
[2:09:08] to come to comfort them that born he
[2:09:12] can't deal with sick people how dare you
[2:09:17] sit in church on judge people we are
[2:09:19] bunch of sick people because that's who
[2:09:22] Jesus came for he came to heal the sick
[2:09:27] he came to restore the black slider he
[2:09:29] came to pick up the broken pieces you
[2:09:36] made me see them
[2:09:37] I'm tired of people who know two three
[2:09:40] chords no to three scriptures and don't
[2:09:42] have an understanding that this message
[2:09:44] is all about love and all about
[2:09:46] forgiveness and there's blood on the
[2:09:48] mercy seat the same blood for you is the
[2:09:51] same platform II
[2:09:54] [Music]
[2:09:54] [Applause]
[2:10:01] you may be seated that's why God has to
[2:10:07] make sure it's rightly divided have
[2:10:12] knowledge this could just couldn't
[2:10:13] seumas don't let the argument for course
[2:10:15] for these and you can check one
[2:10:17] another's hand what court is definite
[2:10:19] what's the scriptures therefore then huh
[2:10:23] nor knowledge have all knowledge it's
[2:10:26] just cool any prophet said it this way
[2:10:27] that's how it isn't I'm no understanding
[2:10:32] that if it wasn't for the grace of God
[2:10:34] you'd be dead in a hospital be somewhere
[2:10:36] drinking smoking you didn't deliver
[2:10:38] yourself you call yourself how do you
[2:10:41] judge somebody else you don't know my
[2:10:42] story I don't know your story but his
[2:10:46] love his grace his knowledge his
[2:10:48] understanding his wisdom reaches to the
[2:10:52] highest mountain goes to the lowest
[2:10:55] Valley it was cause knowledge of what
[2:11:07] the fall of man meant and it's
[2:11:10] understanding that there was no way back
[2:11:12] for us and its wisdom and it would take
[2:11:14] a kinsman redeemer to come and take a
[2:11:18] place for us that he left his throne of
[2:11:20] glory and came down to Calvary what
[2:11:25] right do we have to condemn one another
[2:11:28] when we ought to be praying for one
[2:11:30] another
[2:11:31] oh god help us this morning to see the
[2:11:34] knowledge understanding and wisdom of a
[2:11:37] great God you may be seated
[2:11:43] Sunday School this morning the Prophet
[2:11:48] said he went out to eat one time I
[2:11:50] believe it was eating he looks around
[2:11:54] you see a woman dressed a certain way
[2:11:57] look in a certain way he had the
[2:12:00] knowledge that that was wrong but he
[2:12:06] didn't understand her story
[2:12:09] and he started to condemn that woman and
[2:12:12] got dropped down in front of him and
[2:12:14] showed him his sins and a blood pumping
[2:12:17] it off and he got an understanding that
[2:12:20] he also was a sinner because very easy
[2:12:22] for us with a little bit of knowledge I
[2:12:24] got Aragon to get proud and when the
[2:12:26] Lord dealt with him he went to that
[2:12:28] woman and as he began to minister to her
[2:12:30] she said to him I was a Christian one
[2:12:32] time oh god help us but I lost my way
[2:12:36] knowledge was a new understanding human
[2:12:38] in the prophet when wisdom was able to
[2:12:40] minister to friends I must spending time
[2:12:50] preaching about the quotes or the
[2:12:52] scriptures now I'm talking about you
[2:12:53] having a knowledge and understanding and
[2:12:55] the wisdom of God as a personal
[2:12:57] experience because God has had coming
[2:12:59] for a church or a group he's dealing
[2:13:01] with individuals and that relationship
[2:13:03] is one of love what time the prophet
[2:13:11] went to a meeting and as he got there
[2:13:13] there was almost a colored church as he
[2:13:16] would describe it and he heard dancing
[2:13:17] and shouting and the Prophet was a
[2:13:18] little taken aback by the worship he
[2:13:21] said I don't have this in my church this
[2:13:23] is a little strange and the Lord kept
[2:13:26] him on his shoulder and said he was
[2:13:27] sitting in the seat it was gone for my
[2:13:32] balance it before he recognized he was
[2:13:33] dancing in the middle of them it was not
[2:13:36] by his choice by his volition but God
[2:13:39] took a rule of the Prophet to show him
[2:13:41] certain things and in our walk with God
[2:13:45] he has a desire because the pastor kind
[2:13:48] of reveal God to you it has to be God
[2:13:51] himself and that's what people have
[2:13:54] missed it people are lined up like
[2:13:56] soldiers and churches this is my church
[2:13:58] my adoption my pastor my teacher
[2:14:00] wherever you see koco's we a sovereign
[2:14:03] Church left-right-left straight away
[2:14:10] when god is love and he wanted a sylvan
[2:14:15] based on love we don't reach out enough
[2:14:17] we don't pray enough we don't cry out
[2:14:21] enough we don't testify enough we don't
[2:14:24] love enough we don't watch happy enough
[2:14:26] we don't give him praise enough we don't
[2:14:29] encourage one another amount may God
[2:14:32] give a spiritual understanding today
[2:14:36] [Applause]
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:45] Peter and Paul both called both anointed
[2:14:50] both filled with the holy spirit both
[2:14:54] with the knowledge of what the tradition
[2:14:57] was for how the Jews lived but Peter did
[2:15:02] not have an understanding that the
[2:15:05] ministry had changed so Paul and Peter
[2:15:08] currency eye-to-eye
[2:15:10] because Peter has him at the Gentiles
[2:15:11] need to stop eating certain things and
[2:15:14] poor with an understanding see if the
[2:15:19] law of Christ are you with me this
[2:15:22] morning Peter who walked with Christ
[2:15:25] Paul did not walk with Christ but Paul
[2:15:27] was the angel of that age it was a lot
[2:15:30] for Peter to acknowledge that what Paul
[2:15:32] was saying was the truth
[2:15:34] and Paul who was not there with Jesus
[2:15:35] had the spirit quad given Authority and
[2:15:38] set the gold standard for the angels and
[2:15:40] the stars it would come the set Peter
[2:15:42] straight and give grace to the Gentiles
[2:15:44] to access this glory friends knowledge
[2:15:53] and wisdom and understanding you have to
[2:15:55] connect not to your own ability or your
[2:15:57] own study but you have to come to court
[2:16:02] situations in your marriage you go to
[2:16:04] Casa Lord show me how how in your job
[2:16:09] show me how don't just run into
[2:16:13] situations we have all the examples in
[2:16:17] scripture Joshua's day he wants to know
[2:16:19] how to approach Jericho I mean a captain
[2:16:24] of the host comes I'm Justin are you
[2:16:27] force are you against us
[2:16:29] you see what I'm I'm the captain I come
[2:16:33] to answer your prayers you want to know
[2:16:34] how I could be tell you how when you
[2:16:39] read the Psalms and I encourage you
[2:16:41] spend time at the sounds you hear David
[2:16:44] crying I'll order show me keep me hear
[2:16:48] my prayer O God give ear to my
[2:16:49] supplications and I faithfulness answer
[2:16:53] me and in thy righteousness and enter
[2:16:55] not into judgment with thy servant for
[2:16:57] in thy sight shall no man living be
[2:16:59] justified so David is playing his keys
[2:17:02] because you want gotta intervene on the
[2:17:04] situation we rushed too easily into
[2:17:08] situations we trust our own strength and
[2:17:19] that's why when the band said compassion
[2:17:21] is not feeling sorry for people
[2:17:24] compassion is when the will of God at
[2:17:27] that situation with the Pool of Bethesda
[2:17:29] there were many people lean world blind
[2:17:32] and Jesus bypassed all of them I say
[2:17:37] well why didn't Jesus heal everybody
[2:17:39] he's doing the will of God and he came
[2:17:42] to that man what becoming for 38 years
[2:17:44] and asked him will now be made it was
[2:17:49] some of us we start a prayer line so
[2:17:53] they prefer everybody and here's Jesus
[2:17:57] being led by God who it's an individual
[2:18:00] because you do know will of God
[2:18:03] have you asked God for the will of God
[2:18:05] for your life after my preach this
[2:18:06] morning as a Sunday school the will of
[2:18:09] God Lord what would you
[2:18:11] me to do lord help me to pray and help
[2:18:14] you to pray for what I need to pray for

[2:18:21] to pray for what you think is a Lord
[2:18:22] guide me even in my prayer life help me

[2:18:31] God help I'm not gonna be too much
[2:18:32] longer with you this morning
[2:18:33] this is just part one Lena foundation on
[2:18:35] knowledge understanding and wisdom so
[2:18:40] that we could be better Christians and
[2:18:41] live a real Christian life piece on the
[2:18:45] scriptures and a message of Malachi for
[2:18:47] somebody same the Apostles took no
[2:18:58] thought of what they were thinking
[2:19:00] because they no longer needed to think
[2:19:05] they were speaking for God who needed a
[2:19:07] mouthpiece they were thinking his snorts
[2:19:12] can the church and many times when you
[2:19:16] read scripture we see it is difference
[2:19:19] between God's thoughts and our thoughts
[2:19:21] and that's why we're trying to close the
[2:19:23] gap this morning from the word between
[2:19:26] the way we think and the way God thinks
[2:19:29] I'm the same and when God spoke to kitty
[2:19:32] say Keenan a mighty man of Valor that
[2:19:34] was God thoughts look around he said my
[2:19:42] tribe is the smallest tribe my family is

[2:19:47] army smallest one in my tribe and you
[2:19:50] calling me a mighty man of Valor his
[2:19:52] thinking was little I remember God
[2:19:54] thinking and sending him and I never
[2:19:57] would have you think that you were

[2:27:57] 40 years in the wilderness fame to
[2:28:00] unlearn Oh help me him to unlearn what
[2:28:04] he had learned God had 40 years in the
[2:28:07] wilderness for him to forget his
[2:28:08] knowledge and get a heavenly knowledge
[2:28:10] God took 40 years up to take on his
[2:28:13] human understanding because his human
[2:28:16] knowledge and his human underst
[2:28:17] he could have killed one man but when he
[2:28:20] got God's knowledge I'm God
[2:28:22] understanding and God's wisdom he can
[2:28:24] walk down the Pharaoh
[2:28:26] I said Pharaoh let my people go that's
[2:28:38] why the bus it will not be money not
[2:28:41] made my might nor by power but by the
[2:28:44] spirit said the Lord understand God is a
[2:28:46] spirit and I swear at me he drops down
[2:28:49] his thoughts his thinking's on the
[2:28:52] matter every matter in your life good as

[2:29:29] with your wife with your child with your
[2:29:32] boss with your dog with the fly outside
[2:29:35] your house he knows all things there's
[2:29:38] nothing he does not know as if that's

[2:29:54] not only where your daughter is but what
[2:29:57] she is going through right now
[2:29:58] he also understand the pain you feel
[2:30:02] about where your daughter is right now
[2:30:04] because he knows all things and he
[2:30:06] understands all things and because of
[2:30:09] his knowledge because of his
[2:30:11] understanding he has perfect wisdom
[2:30:13] about when to intervene how to intervene
[2:30:17] what will happen when he intervenes Oh
[2:30:20] God Almighty
[2:30:22] help us this opponent is anything too

[2:30:30] appointed time I will return to you and
[2:30:33] you'll see your house delivered you'll
[2:30:35] see your family delivered you will see
[2:30:37] your situation deliver

[2:30:57] has the knowledge may God give us the
[2:31:00] understanding that he understands and
[2:31:03] may God give us the wisdom that he has
[2:31:06] the wisdom to deal with every situation
[2:31:08] no one other prophet could see I take
[2:31:11] every spirit under my control
[2:31:13] because when there's perfect knowledge
[2:31:15] perfect understanding and pappad wisdom
[2:31:18] nothing is out of place full authority
[2:31:26] and God promised that this endtime bride
[2:31:30] will be thinking his thoughts she will
[2:31:33] be doing what he wants done knows what
[2:31:36] he wants done with the wood the wood is
[2:31:38] our weapon the wood is our defense the
[2:31:41] wood is our offense the word is powerful
[2:31:44] shop sharper than a two-edged sword the
[2:31:48] wood can cut out the spirit of
[2:31:49] fornication this morning the spirit of
[2:31:52] adultery spirit of drinking lion lost
[2:31:55] pornography the Word of God is able to
[2:31:58] cut it out today break every chain when
[2:32:01] the devil met Jesus he didn't even need
[2:32:03] to use her spirit to deal with the devil
[2:32:06] he just use the word he rightly applied
[2:32:08] the word it is written it is written it
[2:32:11] is also written you may be seated
[2:32:16] [Applause]
[2:32:21] [Music]
[2:32:26] because give us a knowledge that to be
[2:32:29] carnally minded is death give us an
[2:32:32] understanding of what it means and when
[2:32:34] we go in our own flesh and our own
[2:32:36] devices on our own inspiration that we
[2:32:39] are coming contrary to the will of God
[2:32:40] but a Braille appears an entire message
[2:32:42] doing call a service without it being
[2:32:44] his will many times the actions are the
[2:32:46] activities we do that we think pleases
[2:32:49] God God caused an abomination because
[2:32:51] it's not his will ministers reaching out
[2:32:54] of his will people acting out of this
[2:32:56] will Lord we want your will to reign in
[2:32:59] this house as for me and my house we
[2:33:01] will serve the Lord bring black to pray
[2:33:04] altar bring black the family altar may
[2:33:07] we get the knowledge the understanding
[2:33:08] and the wisdom how to bring our families
[2:33:11] together that the men of God will be
[2:33:13] priests in their homes once again
[2:33:16] perfect order perfect harmony back to
[2:33:19] the Bible back to the principles leave
[2:33:26] town on the day of Pentecost that's what
[2:33:29] we are contending for Ernest Lee
[2:33:32] contending for defeat you may be seated
[2:33:37] are you happier here this morning could
[2:33:40] you take some more when the alpha church
[2:33:46] fell where the Williams falling away
[2:33:51] means you begin to lose certain things
[2:33:54] so the Alpha church fell and with the
[2:33:56] fall they forgot things so they lost
[2:34:00] knowledge they forgot understanding
[2:34:03] understanding is deep because it really
[2:34:05] takes knowledge and puts knowledge into
[2:34:09] perspective
[2:34:11] it fell so much that God has to go to
[2:34:14] the Catholic Church to find a man woman
[2:34:18] who stumbled upon knowledge in the form
[2:34:21] of the scriptures and read the JA shall
[2:34:23] live by faith
[2:34:25] I'm gonna to minister to his knowledge
[2:34:28] to give him a revelation which is a
[2:34:30] deeper understanding of what the
[2:34:32] scripture meant and the conviction and
[2:34:35] the wisdom now what that till he's had
[2:34:37] to write something I kneel it on the
[2:34:42] church door and it was not to be kept
[2:34:45] secret and even though that have his own
[2:34:47] private revelation or private ambition
[2:34:48] but it was for a purpose the wisdom with
[2:34:50] how to deal with the situation and that
[2:34:54] started a great Reformation this gospel
[2:34:58] we preach this morning is dripping with
[2:35:00] blood a lot of sacrifice when true for
[2:35:03] us to be here this morning we could
[2:35:05] claim no credit for this message because
[2:35:07] it's not our message is his message and
[2:35:09] a lot of blood including his blood was
[2:35:12] shed for us to be here and we have
[2:35:14] become casual and lazy and lean back and
[2:35:17] taking things for granted and God will
[2:35:20] not bless that we support young people
[2:35:25] asleep but the fear of the Lord is the
[2:35:27] beginning of knowledge the beginning of
[2:35:29] wisdom and the Bible says the angel of
[2:35:32] the lord encamps around those who fear
[2:35:33] him so there is no protection for those
[2:35:36] that don't fear him when you break the
[2:35:42] word and you go on your and proposal
[2:35:44] lean not on your own understanding so
[2:35:49] when we talk about knowledge
[2:35:50] understanding and wisdom will speak
[2:35:52] about your knowledge and your
[2:35:54] understanding and your wisdom because
[2:35:57] that will feel rich over connecting to
[2:36:01] his knowledge his understanding and his
[2:36:06] wisdom come to church say man is it
[2:36:10] becoming real to anybody
[2:36:22] at the end of this journey of coming to
[2:36:26] church on Sundays and Wednesdays and
[2:36:28] Fridays and youth services is that we
[2:36:30] ought to be christ-like that just like
[2:36:34] inna we could be walking and in one day
[2:36:36] our feet would hit the Kings Highway
[2:36:46] but the banner said one of these days
[2:36:48] the last someone will be preached the
[2:36:52] last song will be sung the Bible be read
[2:36:56] for the last time and a great sifting or
[2:37:02] a marking of the exam people's will come
[2:37:07] and that marking of the exam papers is
[2:37:10] not about doctrine or knowledge but is
[2:37:16] if you went all the way to apply the
[2:37:20] word to apply the blood on your house
[2:37:25] most of the issues we fuss about and
[2:37:30] spend time stressing about our temporal
[2:37:34] issues that have no bearing on the
[2:37:36] kingdom or the things of the kingdom and
[2:37:39] the devil does a great job of affecting
[2:37:42] our lives and we do very little to push
[2:37:44] back because the devil has no power he
[2:37:50] was stripped of his power when Jesus
[2:37:55] went and took the keys of hell
[2:37:59] so the devil has people chopped and they
[2:38:02] could walk on anytime because he can't
[2:38:07] even lock them because he has no keys we
[2:38:11] see that again there we were trapped in
[2:38:14] their minds but he has no keys to keep
[2:38:17] you trapped that's why the Prophet said
[2:38:22] that your healing is based on your feet
[2:38:29] salvation is based on your feet it has
[2:38:33] nothing to do with what your grandfather
[2:38:35] did or your father did or what your past
[2:38:37] was because he said prostitutes walked
[2:38:40] into the meetings her toe would get a
[2:38:43] hole of feet and they exited the devil's
[2:38:47] hotel because the devil couldn't hold
[2:38:51] them because I'd ever know how deep the
[2:38:55] devil have no security so you can walk
[2:38:57] out anytime from the devil's it's not a
[2:39:02] present because you have no keys the
[2:39:03] devil's hotel you can just get up right
[2:39:06] now and you could walk out he can stop
[2:39:09] you he could try to look like he have
[2:39:12] power but I'm telling you he have more
[2:39:14] power so you can walk out right now
[2:39:17] that's sickness in your body you could
[2:39:19] walk out right now the Prophet stood and
[2:39:24] there were people who didn't even come
[2:39:26] to the prayer and there was a lady one
[2:39:28] time but it tells you know it she walked
[2:39:30] up to the Prophet with her crutches look
[2:39:33] at the Prophet shrugged her crutches and
[2:39:35] walked back out because you recognize
[2:39:38] that a lot of Moses still lived the God
[2:39:42] of Abraham still lived
[2:39:45] [Applause]
[2:39:46] [Music]
[2:39:48] so your deliverance it is based on the
[2:39:51] merit of your feet if dog can't believe
[2:39:55] your family is delivered already your
[2:39:59] healing is already complete your family
[2:40:03] is delivered
[2:40:04] you just have to receive it you can walk
[2:40:07] in it and you can worship reckless
[2:40:10] worship because it ever can hold no more
[2:40:12] you can throw down the fork you can turn
[2:40:15] on the wheelbarrow
[2:40:17] you can throw down the hammer you can
[2:40:19] draw down all these sub the taskmaster
[2:40:21] had little choice on this morning and
[2:40:25] we're gonna head to the promised land
[2:40:27] I didn't say goodbye Egypt goodbye world
[2:40:30] i spare no longer with you cut by
[2:40:33] pleasures of sin i stand longer with you
[2:40:37] [Applause]
[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:44] [Applause]
[2:40:56] could you take some more that's what we
[2:41:00] came to church for this morning right
[2:41:05] the devil doesn't like this you know
[2:41:29] proverbs 1 and verse 20 wisdom cried
[2:41:32] without so wisdom is being defined here
[2:41:37] as a person and crying outside she
[2:41:41] uttered her voice in the streets so
[2:41:44] wisdom is looking to help and his soul
[2:41:49] interested in helping wisdom is crying
[2:41:52] out to anyone who would listen she cry
[2:41:55] it in the chief police of concourse
[2:41:58] crying where everybody is walking in the
[2:42:02] openings of the kids in the city she uh
[2:42:04] Teresa would sing how long he's simple
[2:42:07] ones will he love simplicity and thus
[2:42:11] corners delight in their scorning and
[2:42:13] fools hate knowledge tourney as my
[2:42:17] reproof behold I will pour out my spirit
[2:42:20] unto you I will make normal I have
[2:42:23] stretched out my hand and no man
[2:42:25] regarded but he have said I've not all
[2:42:29] my counsel and with none of my reproof
[2:42:32] listen to the consequence when wisdom is
[2:42:34] crying out I'm sorry just record once to
[2:42:38] give me the Holy Ghost warning even one
[2:42:39] to receive it and wisdom from the word
[2:42:43] is crying out for us to change our walk
[2:42:46] faster be more sincere
[2:42:49] and our failure to act on this cry from
[2:42:52] wisdom listen to the words because I
[2:42:56] have call and he have refused I have
[2:42:57] stretched out my hand and no man regard
[2:42:59] it but he have set up not all my counsel
[2:43:03] and with none of my reproof I also will
[2:43:07] laugh at your calamity
[2:43:09] I will mock when your fear commits when
[2:43:13] your fear cometh desolation and your
[2:43:15] destruction coming as a whirlwind when
[2:43:18] distress and anguish commit upon you
[2:43:20] then shall they call upon me and I will
[2:43:23] not answer they shall seek me early but
[2:43:28] they shall not find me for that the
[2:43:31] hated knowledge and did not choose the
[2:43:34] fear of the Lord I want to remind the
[2:43:39] church this morning the fear of the Lord
[2:43:41] is a choice it is not an automatic
[2:43:45] behavior the fear of the Lord is what is
[2:43:50] what keeps a young woman modest the fear
[2:43:55] of the Lord is what keeps you faithful
[2:43:57] to your wife both fear and love the fear
[2:44:02] of the Lord and a love for his word and
[2:44:05] a love for your wife but he said they
[2:44:12] have not chosen the fear of the Lord
[2:44:14] instead they have chosen the fear of man
[2:44:17] because if the fear of the Lord should
[2:44:20] make you act a certain way when you
[2:44:22] don't act that way it means there's
[2:44:24] something else influencing you and there
[2:44:26] are people here who fear their neighbors
[2:44:28] thoughts about them more than the fear
[2:44:30] of the Lord they fear what their school
[2:44:34] friends will see more than they fear the
[2:44:37] Lord
[2:44:37] they fear how their boss thinks about
[2:44:40] them more than they fear the Lord they
[2:44:44] fear what their family members think
[2:44:46] about them more than they fear the Lord
[2:44:53] maybe search our hearts today because if
[2:44:56] you truly fear the Lord he will honor
[2:44:58] him
[2:44:59] you are respective you will reverence
[2:45:01] him the fear of the Lord will make wives
[2:45:04] submit to their husbands the fear of the
[2:45:09] Lord will make husbands love their wives
[2:45:11] the fear of the Lord will make sure an
[2:45:14] OPD appearance the fear of the Lord will
[2:45:18] bring you here silly to the house of God
[2:45:20] because you want to hear his voice made
[2:45:25] us sing into your soul today the fear of
[2:45:29] the Lord will make you turn from evil
[2:45:31] and away from wicked and stay away from
[2:45:34] shitty places the fear of the Lord will
[2:45:36] make you aware that he's watching every
[2:45:38] move that you make the fear of the Lord
[2:45:41] will make you wake up in the morning and
[2:45:43] go to your knees and prayer and say Lord
[2:45:45] early will I seek me I look to the hills
[2:45:48] from whence cometh my help the fear of
[2:45:50] the Lord is about his majesty is about
[2:45:52] his glory is about his omnipotence his
[2:45:54] omniscience his deity is presence his
[2:45:57] August being the fact that the four
[2:45:59] twenty elders at the same and that's a
[2:46:01] fail the Lord he is God mighty in battle
[2:46:05] the Egyptians fear him the Romans fear
[2:46:08] Him the Greeks fear him armies were
[2:46:11] scattered before him and this God has
[2:46:15] said there shall be no other God before
[2:46:18] me may this resonate in your soul this
[2:46:23] morning sunday-school message
[2:46:39] [Music]
[2:46:46] big or open your understanding this
[2:46:48] morning I'm getting ready to close out
[2:46:52] the disciples over Jesus for three and a
[2:46:56] half years they grew up with knowledge
[2:47:02] they grew up knowing the Scriptures in
[2:47:06] so much and even spending time with
[2:47:08] Jesus their knowledge would have
[2:47:09] increased because Jesus was ministering
[2:47:12] to them and sharing things with them but
[2:47:13] in Jesus resurrection ministry they
[2:47:16] barely opened their understanding to the
[2:47:21] scriptures that they had knowledge of
[2:47:23] before which meant even while they were
[2:47:26] with Jesus the understanding had not yet
[2:47:28] been opened they have knowledge of it
[2:47:30] described and the Pharisees and
[2:47:33] Sadducees they had knowledge without
[2:47:35] understanding because had they had
[2:47:37] understanding when Jesus stood and read
[2:47:40] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me they
[2:47:42] thought he was reading from but when he
[2:47:46] said this didn't scriptures will fill
[2:47:47] that was not knowledge that was an
[2:47:49] understanding that before their very
[2:47:51] eyes this treaty was being fulfilled or
[2:47:53] somebody pitched back to me everyone
[2:47:57] knew the scripture of the voice crying
[2:47:59] in the wilderness but when John was in
[2:48:02] the earth nobody understood that that
[2:48:05] scripture was in front of the eyes Mary
[2:48:11] grew up living her life as normal with
[2:48:13] knowledge that a virgin will conceive it
[2:48:15] took an angel Gabriel to come to her and
[2:48:18] say he'll married our highly favored and
[2:48:20] he brought an understanding to the
[2:48:22] knowledge that she had that she was the
[2:48:24] one chosen to bring for the Christ and
[2:48:28] many people come to church come to the
[2:48:30] message with knowledge of scriptures
[2:48:32] knowledge of course without an
[2:48:34] understanding of your place in Christ an
[2:48:36] understanding of the expectation not
[2:48:38] just of where you ought to go but the
[2:48:40] behavior and the character that's
[2:48:42] required to go there be
[2:48:44] knowledge alone it's not going to take
[2:48:46] it takes you perfect love to catch you
[2:48:49] there and it takes an understanding and
[2:48:51] perfect love is the full wisdom of God
[2:48:53] charity itself to drop down to guide you
[2:48:57] through your journey that you don't make
[2:49:00] the wrong steps musician cigarette to
[2:49:02] come this morning we have back to the
[2:49:07] Bible back to the scripture may God give
[2:49:18] you knowledge this morning that you're
[2:49:20] gonna make it may give you an
[2:49:23] understanding that no devil is gonna
[2:49:25] stop you and me give you wisdom that
