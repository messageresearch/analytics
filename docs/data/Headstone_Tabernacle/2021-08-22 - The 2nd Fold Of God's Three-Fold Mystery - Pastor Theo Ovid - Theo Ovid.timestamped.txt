[34:23] and by him all things consist
[34:26] and he's the head of the body the church
[34:28] who is the beginning
[34:30] the firstborn from the dead
[34:32] that in all things he might have the
[34:34] preeminence
[34:36] for it please the father that in him
[34:40] should all fullness dwell
[34:42] and having made peace
[34:45] through the blood of his cross by him to
[34:47] reconcile all things unto himself but he
[34:50] might say whether there be things in
[34:52] earth
[34:53] or things in heaven
[34:55] and you that were sometimes alienated
[34:58] and enemies in your mind
[35:00] by wicked works yet no had he reconciled
[35:03] in the body of his flesh to death to
[35:05] present you holy
[35:07] and unbelievable
[35:08] and unreproveable in his sight if
[35:12] he continued in defeat
[35:14] grounded and settled and be not move
[35:16] away from the hope of the gospel which
[35:19] you have heard
[35:20] and which was preached to every creature
[35:22] which is under heaven whereof i paul are
[35:24] made a minister
[35:25] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[35:28] and up that which is behind
[35:31] of the affliction of christ in my flesh
[35:33] for his body's sake which is the church
[35:36] whereof
[35:37] i am made a minister
[35:39] according to the dispensation of god
[35:41] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[35:44] the word of god
[35:46] even the mystery which has been hid from
[35:48] ages and from generations but now is
[35:51] made manifest to his saints
[35:53] to whom god would make known
[35:56] what is the riches
[35:58] of the glory of this mystery
[36:00] among the gentiles which is christ
[36:03] in you
[36:04] the hope of glory
[36:06] whom we preach
[36:08] warning every man
[36:10] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[36:12] that we represent every man perfect
[36:15] in christ jesus
[36:16] our second scripture is from sin john
[36:19] chapter 12 reading from verse 20.
[36:22] and there were certain greeks among them
[36:24] that came to worship at the feast
[36:26] the same came therefore to philip which
[36:28] was of bethesda of galileans decide him
[36:31] saying sir
[36:32] we would see jesus
[36:34] philip come in and tell us andrew and
[36:35] again andrew and philip tell jesus and
[36:38] jesus answered saying
[36:40] the all is come
[36:42] that the son of man
[36:43] should be glorified
[36:45] verily verily i say unto you except the
[36:47] corner wheat
[36:49] fall into the ground and die it's about
[36:51] the lawn
[36:52] but if it die
[36:53] it bringing forth much fruit
[36:56] our last scripture is from job
[36:58] chapter 42
[37:00] read in verse 5
[37:02] and 6.
[37:06] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[37:08] air
[37:09] but now my eyes see it thee
[37:12] wherefore i uphold myself
[37:14] and repent and dust
[37:16] and ashes let's let's pray one more time
[37:18] father we have read your word we pray
[37:21] the power of your spirit will come and
[37:23] move in your word and move into the
[37:25] hearts of your people no man could give
[37:28] revelation the holy ghost alone is the
[37:31] divine
[37:32] revealer of the revelation of jesus
[37:34] christ may the spirit come down upon the
[37:36] people's minds hearts lives in their
[37:39] homes and reveal your word to them
[37:41] in jesus name i ask it amen amen god
[37:43] bless you
[37:44] may be seated where you are
[37:46] praise god
[37:48] so this morning
[37:49] i have a title
[37:51] the second full of god's threefold
[37:54] mystery
[37:56] that's the title that i have this
[37:57] morning
[37:58] the second full
[38:00] of god's
[38:01] threefold mystery
[38:03] i have a subject
[38:05] the death of a corner of wheat
[38:08] and have an inspiration
[38:10] the spirit of truth
[38:13] and that
[38:14] inspiration the spirit of truth
[38:16] that is some of the text jesus in john
[38:18] 16 13 how be it when he
[38:20] prophecy
[38:22] he the spirit of truth is come
[38:25] he would guide you
[38:27] into all truth
[38:29] for he shall not speak of himself but
[38:32] whatsoever he shall hear
[38:34] that shall he speak
[38:35] and he will show you things
[38:37] to come
[38:39] and i have one other context scripture
[38:42] my song strange
[38:44] but since i'm from saint john chapter 21
[38:46] don't if you'll get into it
[38:48] but is 18 and 19.
[38:50] and this is jesus speaking to peter
[38:53] saying very very nice unto thee
[38:55] when thou was young
[38:57] though goodness thyself and walkers
[38:59] withered are with buddhists
[39:01] but when thou art behold
[39:03] thou shalt stretch for thy hands
[39:06] and another shall goody
[39:08] and carry thee with the doubt what is
[39:11] not
[39:12] this speak he
[39:13] signifying by what debt he should
[39:15] glorify god
[39:17] and when he had spoken this he said unto
[39:19] him
[39:20] follow me
[39:21] and in the amplified
[39:24] it's written this way i assure you most
[39:26] suddenly i tell you
[39:28] when you were young
[39:30] you good at yourself and put on your own
[39:32] belt or girdle and you walked about
[39:34] wherever you pleased to go
[39:36] but when you grow old you were stretched
[39:38] out your hands and someone else will put
[39:40] a girl around you
[39:42] and carry you
[39:44] where you do not wish to go
[39:46] he said this to indicate what kind of
[39:48] debt peter would glorify god and after
[39:50] this
[39:51] he said unto him
[39:53] follow me
[39:54] so this morning
[39:56] we truly want to follow jesus
[39:58] because this is what this gospel is all
[40:00] about
[40:01] is all about jesus christ
[40:04] to the end
[40:05] as we read
[40:06] in colossians
[40:08] praise the lord
[40:09] that he is the head of the body the
[40:11] church
[40:12] who is the beginning
[40:14] the firstborn from the dead
[40:16] that in all things he might have
[40:18] the preeminences
[40:20] all things he might have the
[40:22] preeminences
[40:23] okay
[40:24] so let's go
[40:26] the first fall
[40:28] of this threefold revelation of god
[40:31] is god wanting to reveal himself
[40:34] that is the first foe
[40:36] it's very simple it's one
[40:39] two three a first full
[40:41] a second full
[40:43] and a third full of this great mystery
[40:45] that go at hand in his mind
[40:48] god was so mysterious
[40:50] the challenge for this mysterious god
[40:51] how to reveal himself
[40:55] and which he did in christ jesus
[40:57] and the book of daniel when daniel was
[40:59] trying to understand the mystery of god
[41:02] god told daniel in daniel 12 8-9 and i
[41:04] heard and i understood not what
[41:07] then said i oh my lord what shall be the
[41:10] end of these things
[41:12] and he said go thy way daniel
[41:14] for the words are closed up
[41:17] and sealed till the time of the end
[41:20] so there was a specific time
[41:22] that god allocated
[41:24] for the unsealing of the book
[41:27] and the unsealing of the words of the
[41:29] book
[41:30] march 18 1963
[41:32] to march 24 1963 the opening of this
[41:36] seven seals as shown to the 20th century
[41:39] prophet william branham a prophet
[41:42] according to malachi 4.
[41:44] so all this book was open because this
[41:47] mighty angel of revelation 10
[41:49] came down and brought this open book to
[41:52] this prophet and sent out a message that
[41:55] we now have on books and tapes
[41:57] and after the prophet left the scene
[42:00] because time
[42:01] must unfold a bright history
[42:04] many men stepped into the void or gap
[42:07] left by the departure
[42:09] of that prophet
[42:11] some positive
[42:12] some negative
[42:14] this void or gap
[42:17] or space or or that that that that place
[42:19] that empty place after the prophet left
[42:22] is to be filled
[42:24] by the manifestation of the sons of god
[42:27] in their season and that time
[42:29] so we said some men step in there
[42:31] positive
[42:32] some men step into the negative
[42:34] paul in acts 20 27-31 said for i have
[42:38] not shunned to declare unto you all the
[42:40] gospel the counsel of god
[42:42] and he gave a warning take he therefore
[42:45] unto yourselves
[42:46] unto all the flock
[42:48] over which the holy ghost had made you
[42:51] overseers
[42:52] to feed the church of god which had
[42:55] purchased with his own blood for i know
[42:57] this paul was a prophet and he is
[43:00] prophesying and i know this that after
[43:03] mighty parting shall grievous wolves
[43:06] enter in among you
[43:07] not sparing the flock
[43:10] also
[43:11] of your own self shall menarize
[43:14] speaking perverse things to draw away
[43:18] disciples after them
[43:20] not disciples to follow christ now
[43:23] this is disciples
[43:24] to follow them verse 31 paul speaking
[43:27] therefore watch
[43:29] and remember that by the space of three
[43:31] years i cease
[43:33] not to warn everyone night and day with
[43:37] tears
[43:38] so paul was warning the church about
[43:40] these men
[43:42] and here's the prophet now he said oh
[43:44] you people don't miss this these
[43:45] impostors
[43:46] impersonators appeared after the true
[43:49] one had went for it first
[43:51] so these guys don't come out when the
[43:52] true one is there they come out after
[43:55] they come to impersonate the devil
[43:58] cannot create anything he's a pervert of
[43:59] the original what is sin russians
[44:02] perverted what's adultery the right act
[44:04] perfected what is a lie the truth
[44:05] represented a perversion
[44:09] a perversion of the original word look
[44:11] at balaam a version of the original word
[44:13] look at zedekiah a perversion of the
[44:15] original word now all these are prophets
[44:17] we're talking about now all these are
[44:18] men so-called men of god
[44:21] now the bible said
[44:23] that these guys would come out after
[44:26] and pervert
[44:28] the original word
[44:30] vindicated and prove to be the truth
[44:33] oh hallelujah do the work of an
[44:35] evangelist still reading from the
[44:37] prophet in that corner yonder make full
[44:40] proof of your ministry for the time will
[44:43] come prophecy when they will not end
[44:45] your song doctrine but after their own
[44:48] lusts shall heap for themselves teachers
[44:51] having itchiness then go ahead and do
[44:53] anything you want to it's all right we
[44:55] got the signs and wonders and shall turn
[44:57] from the truth
[44:59] and be brought into fables or dogmas
[45:01] so this is the word from this prophet
[45:03] these guys
[45:04] and i'll refer to them now going forward
[45:06] as these guys
[45:08] these guys who come out after the
[45:11] original
[45:12] to pervert the original word vindicated
[45:16] and that is why he said the spirit
[45:19] the prophet
[45:21] and the bride will be saying the same
[45:23] thing
[45:24] and what they say will have already been
[45:27] said
[45:28] in the word
[45:29] now what dogma was a dogma he said a
[45:31] dogma is a fixed especially religious
[45:35] belief
[45:36] or set of beliefs that people are
[45:39] expected to accept without any doubts
[45:42] so our minds speak it and they expect
[45:44] people to receive it just like that
[45:46] but don't know doubts because he said
[45:49] you meet an angel he hears something he
[45:51] feels something he had a dream but paul
[45:54] said after my departure
[45:57] false brethren
[45:59] variant of the truth
[46:02] false teachers
[46:04] false ministers
[46:06] lying in wait to deceive
[46:08] and that's what ephesians 4 says these
[46:11] men lying in wait
[46:13] to deceive
[46:15] okay
[46:16] no so that's on the negative side on the
[46:19] positive side the prophet says i said
[46:21] talk about jacob and he saw one fight in
[46:24] the other one is natural one is
[46:26] spiritual he said these men
[46:28] if they pick it up and go out with it
[46:31] they can make more sense to it oh praise
[46:34] god people love that part make more
[46:36] sense to it give an explanation a
[46:39] revelation an interpretation make more
[46:42] sense but he didn't finish there
[46:44] he said these men
[46:46] if they pick it up
[46:48] and go out with it
[46:49] they can make more sense to it see
[46:54] to bring it to a place you would
[46:56] i just want to lay this seed
[47:02] this is the prophet now i just want to
[47:04] lay this seed
[47:06] then hope
[47:08] they make it come to life so it's not
[47:11] men's own seed
[47:13] it's the seed of the son of man
[47:16] that the son of man come to show and he
[47:18] is saying i hope they make it come to
[47:21] life what is the it there that it is the
[47:25] seed that he came to lay
[47:27] oh glory to god because one son of man
[47:29] come he's the sower
[47:31] and the son of man come to sow seed
[47:33] so once he come to sow seed it has to be
[47:36] the same seed
[47:37] from the barnyard of the son of man oh
[47:40] glory to god we can't plant our own seed
[47:42] get our own seed i have a perverted seed
[47:45] a mystery of the seed no it's the same
[47:47] seed
[47:48] oh glory to god hallelujah from the son
[47:51] of man
[47:52] oh praise god
[47:54] hallelujah
[47:56] union court
[47:57] the other statement is used
[48:00] you know and you know in legalese and in
[48:03] legal terminology they try to cover all
[48:05] the grounds
[48:06] so there is no room for ambiguity
[48:09] because if there's a little loophole
[48:10] somebody could slip through and get
[48:12] through
[48:12] and get get off the case and so on so
[48:15] they make sure it will
[48:18] so in legal terminology is something
[48:20] else you know they make sure every gun
[48:22] is covered
[48:23] so they say do you swear to tell the
[48:25] truth
[48:27] the whole truth
[48:28] and nothing but the truth
[48:30] you know and i always wonder about that
[48:32] i don't have a detail of why they
[48:34] present it like that i just have a view
[48:36] of it
[48:37] in other words do you tell the fair to
[48:39] tell the truth in other words you're not
[48:40] going to lie right
[48:42] all right you're not going to lie
[48:45] so that's the first part
[48:47] then are you going to tell the whole
[48:48] truth all of it
[48:49] or are you going to flavor it nothing
[48:51] but the truth
[48:52] so it covers all area don't lie
[48:55] tell the whole
[48:57] and don't flavor it
[48:59] okay
[49:00] now
[49:02] the bible talk about the spirit of truth
[49:05] that going to lead you
[49:07] into all truth
[49:09] not just truth
[49:11] but the spirit of truth and the spirit
[49:13] of truth is the person
[49:15] even the holy ghost
[49:16] so it's not just words
[49:18] it's not just words it's the spirit of
[49:20] truth
[49:21] all praise god but if sam said that he's
[49:24] our truth from the inward parts in a man
[49:28] of these three which is to tell the
[49:31] whole the truth the whole truth nothing
[49:33] but the truth
[49:34] to me
[49:35] i say to me the most dangerous one is
[49:38] the second one
[49:40] dealing with the whole truth
[49:43] when you don't get the whole truth
[49:45] listen carefully
[49:47] you can be deceived
[49:49] not by what is said
[49:52] but by what is not said
[49:55] you can be deceived
[49:57] by what is left out
[50:00] amen
[50:01] example
[50:02] a minister will not tell his
[50:03] congregation that he is it
[50:05] i am it i am the best i know more than
[50:07] the rest i am the gods man for the hour
[50:10] no he wouldn't do that
[50:12] just like brahms said nobody will come
[50:13] and say i am jesus and they will just
[50:14] laugh at him
[50:15] see
[50:16] so what he does
[50:18] he will blast other ministers
[50:21] show them inferior to his congregation
[50:24] and then the congregation on their own
[50:27] deducts and concludes
[50:29] he is the only man god can use
[50:34] causing the people to believe a lie
[50:38] oh my and that
[50:40] tizen
[50:42] always won about this sleeve of hands
[50:44] and that is what
[50:45] the magicians use
[50:48] and is the terminology that the use
[50:49] called not distraction
[50:52] but misdirection
[50:54] that's the word that they use
[50:56] a misdirection so they talk and the
[50:59] hands moving
[51:01] sometimes they have a verbal something
[51:03] sometimes they have a smoke
[51:05] and because of a human you look and you
[51:06] see the explosion and they put that as a
[51:09] distraction or to send your mind think a
[51:12] different way that they could do this
[51:13] stuff at the side so you see a ball here
[51:16] all of a sudden i could disappear and
[51:17] the zone is empty a sleigh of hands
[51:21] and that
[51:22] misdirection
[51:24] is sometimes defined as
[51:26] the intentional
[51:29] deflection of attention for the purpose
[51:32] of disguise
[51:34] let me say it again
[51:36] this misdirection
[51:39] is the intentional
[51:41] deflection of attention for the purpose
[51:44] of disguise
[51:45] more precisely
[51:47] successful misdirection might manipulate
[51:51] not only people's perception but their
[51:54] memory of what happened
[51:56] or their reasoning about how the effect
[51:58] was done
[52:00] remind me years ago
[52:01] had something called subliminal
[52:02] seduction in which they had those reel
[52:06] to reel those big real tapes for cinema
[52:08] and somebody get that right idea to put
[52:11] a picture of a coke
[52:13] in between the pictures
[52:15] and it moving so fast that the mind
[52:16] can't see it but it's hidden at the
[52:19] subconscious level
[52:20] all of a sudden people want to drink
[52:22] coke coke coke coke i believe the stop
[52:24] it now is illegal now but all of these
[52:27] is things that they use to play this
[52:29] what they call mind game
[52:31] so it's not just distraction
[52:33] but
[52:34] a misdirection
[52:36] this is distraction is when your
[52:38] audience is too preoccupied to pay
[52:40] attention
[52:41] which is not what you want you want the
[52:43] attention
[52:44] and misdirection specifically means
[52:48] drawing the attention to whatever there
[52:50] is nothing suspicious happening
[52:52] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[52:55] glory hallelujah
[52:57] it come like you don't need the baptism
[53:00] of the holy ghost
[53:01] man might say that why
[53:03] because the seed is in the soul
[53:06] and that's the real thing
[53:08] further
[53:09] because the prophet said you can have
[53:11] the baptism 24 hours a day and still be
[53:13] lost
[53:15] what is left out is where is that
[53:17] baptism
[53:18] if it's on the flesh
[53:20] or if it's on the spirit
[53:22] because peter his seed was in his soul
[53:25] and peter didn't say my seed and my soul
[53:27] i don't need to go in the upper room
[53:31] so be careful
[53:32] not just what you hear
[53:34] but what is being left out
[53:36] what is not being said because peter
[53:38] went up
[53:40] to receive
[53:41] the holy ghost
[53:42] psychology ministers of destruction
[53:46] and misdirection
[53:48] oh my hallelujah
[53:50] come like today
[53:52] some people believe
[53:53] the vaccine is the mark of the beast
[53:56] all right
[53:58] now what it also make them believe
[54:00] without saying it
[54:02] that those who take it have the mark of
[54:04] the beast
[54:05] therefore obviously they have the seal
[54:07] of god
[54:08] but that's not the scriptures there's
[54:10] logic
[54:11] that all those who take the vaccine off
[54:14] they don't have the revelation they they
[54:16] they
[54:17] they catch it they catch a vision two
[54:20] years they are dead and this and that
[54:23] and the enemy is always
[54:25] outside
[54:26] the enemy is always external
[54:29] is rome
[54:30] is the illuminati trilateral council is
[54:33] geopolitical issues that the church is
[54:36] not touching
[54:37] always something on the outside is this
[54:39] pastor is this minister is the devil
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] enemy
[54:45] is always external
[54:47] my god
[54:49] so the prophet said the new birth is a
[54:50] revelation
[54:52] and because the mr god reveal
[54:54] but he also said the new birth is an
[54:56] experience
[54:58] so if we leave out both
[55:01] and don't bring the balance you lean on
[55:03] one side or the other
[55:05] see
[55:06] so watch flesh and blood has not
[55:08] revealed unto you jesus said upon this
[55:10] rock i'll build my church no christ in
[55:12] you
[55:14] makes him the center of life of the
[55:15] revelation see
[55:17] christ's life in you makes him
[55:21] the center of the revelation
[55:23] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[55:27] complete revelation of christ
[55:29] christ in you
[55:31] makes you the complete revelation of the
[55:33] whole thing see what god trying to do
[55:35] what is the new word then you say well
[55:37] brother branham what is the new book it
[55:38] is the revelation of jesus christ
[55:42] personally to you
[55:44] amen not your joint church you shook
[55:46] hand you done something different you
[55:48] said a creed you promised to live by a
[55:50] root of colds but christ
[55:52] the bible he's the word that was
[55:54] revealed to you and no matter what
[55:56] anybody says what take place it is
[55:58] christ pastor priest whatever it might
[56:01] be it is christ in you
[56:03] that is the revelation that the church
[56:06] is built on what revelation christ
[56:08] in you so the new birth is christ
[56:11] is a revelation god has revealed to you
[56:14] this great mystery and that's the new
[56:16] bird now where are you gonna go when you
[56:18] get all that group together where the
[56:20] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[56:23] god expressing it through his word by
[56:26] the same actions the same thing that he
[56:28] did making the word
[56:31] manifest
[56:32] that's a new book
[56:33] as a revelation
[56:35] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[56:38] now he said the new book is an
[56:39] experience
[56:41] the new book is an experience it's the
[56:44] gift of god it's the seal of faith the
[56:47] holy spirit is a seal ephesians 4 30
[56:49] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[56:51] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[56:53] your redemption god made the promise to
[56:55] abraham abraham believed god i was
[56:57] justified by faith god given the sign of
[56:59] circumcision as a seal so he does today
[57:01] we believe him then if you say you
[57:03] believe and do not receive the holy
[57:05] spirit then you do not believe course
[57:06] god promised to give you the holy spirit
[57:09] when you did believe no in believing you
[57:12] do not receive the holy spirit when you
[57:14] believe because paul asks in acts 19
[57:17] have you received the holy ghost since
[57:19] you believe it is the gift of god and
[57:21] when the spirit of god comes into a man
[57:25] it quickens him then he becomes a new
[57:27] creature he receives believes in the
[57:29] immortal god he believes he does all
[57:31] things his heart is tuned with god how
[57:33] wonderful and no matter here we go how
[57:36] much that we try to think we are right
[57:39] insane a creed joining a church you are
[57:42] still what you are until you are
[57:45] actually born again of the spirit of god
[57:48] it doesn't change you your creed joining
[57:51] changing your ideas your good intentions
[57:53] although as good as might seem it's
[57:55] still not right there is something got
[57:57] to happen the word is h-a-p-e-n happen
[58:01] something got to happen the new word is
[58:03] an experience something that takes place
[58:06] so it's not that that brings the new
[58:08] birth oh gloria so it's
[58:10] now the church
[58:12] the different churches they say well you
[58:14] accept this or you believe this it's all
[58:16] right but it isn't oh blessed be the
[58:18] name of it isn't o praise the name of
[58:20] the lord you have to get an experience
[58:22] so the question is which one comes first
[58:24] revelation or experience
[58:27] so
[58:28] jesus after he rules from the dead got
[58:30] his disciples together in private
[58:32] ministry unlock the word to them openly
[58:35] understanding to them and then what
[58:37] happened praise god they were directed
[58:39] to the upper room the worship and the
[58:41] praise god to be under expectation for
[58:43] manifestation after all that word all
[58:46] the mysteries of the old testament being
[58:48] unsealed to them didn't walk up and say
[58:49] we are believers we are message people
[58:51] we right under jesus we under the
[58:53] messiah no he said the promise of my
[58:55] father you have to go in the upper room
[58:57] for that you have to go for dynamics you
[58:59] have to go for the quickening power you
[59:00] have to go for the life that was
[59:01] released at the calvary that day at
[59:04] calvary oh hallelujah in his spirit
[59:06] seven perfect spirits going through all
[59:08] the earth oh hunting those seeds isn't
[59:11] that wonderful today oh blessed be the
[59:13] name of the lord second thessalonians 2
[59:16] 9 11 says even him whose coming is after
[59:19] the working of satan with all power
[59:22] and signs
[59:23] and lying wonders
[59:25] and with all deceivableness of
[59:27] unrighteousness in them that perish
[59:29] because they receive not the love of the
[59:31] truth
[59:32] that they might be saved
[59:34] for discourse god shall send them strong
[59:38] delusion that they should believe a lie
[59:41] strong delusion and this reminds me of
[59:44] all these false ministers false prophets
[59:46] that prophesy the former guy
[59:49] in america would come back into power
[59:52] and be re-elected
[59:53] and they don't want to accept that he
[59:55] was not re-elected so they have to
[59:57] believe
[59:58] the election was stolen something wrong
[1:00:00] with the machine something wrong with
[1:00:02] this somebody changing numbers they have
[1:00:04] to believe and they're going down the
[1:00:05] road like that now they cannot believe
[1:00:07] that spirit
[1:00:09] that line anointing that fallen 400
[1:00:11] prophets
[1:00:12] fall on all of them to prophesy the same
[1:00:14] light and they're going down like that
[1:00:16] and as they go along that different
[1:00:18] mysteries open up to them
[1:00:20] because they are giving over to a strong
[1:00:21] delusion same thing in this message
[1:00:24] after people reject truth
[1:00:26] they begin to get revelations angels of
[1:00:29] light satan disguise
[1:00:30] bringing information not revelation
[1:00:33] information completely off the word of
[1:00:35] god strong delusion oh glory to god my
[1:00:38] kind of vision
[1:00:40] and he said what must i do he went into
[1:00:42] a vision he said go out up
[1:00:45] i see israel scattered like sheep having
[1:00:47] no shepherd
[1:00:48] and that district presbyter walked out
[1:00:50] and smacked him in the mouth and said
[1:00:52] where the word of god the spirit of god
[1:00:54] go when it went out to me and you know
[1:00:56] what god said
[1:00:58] he let a devil go down
[1:01:00] get among them because they were off
[1:01:03] the word to begin with
[1:01:06] so when groups passed as ministers
[1:01:08] churches of the word
[1:01:10] they are open territory for the devil to
[1:01:13] come down among them the bible said if
[1:01:15] they wouldn't believe the word
[1:01:17] he would give that he would give them a
[1:01:19] strong delusion to believe a lie and
[1:01:22] would be dying by it
[1:01:24] if the people
[1:01:26] were talking about the baptism of the
[1:01:28] holy ghost the way they're talking about
[1:01:30] the vaccine all also the churches fill
[1:01:32] up with the holy ghost also revival fire
[1:01:35] burning but the vaccine issue is a
[1:01:37] destruction
[1:01:39] and a misdirection
[1:01:40] of the of the i ain't called the
[1:01:42] preaching coroner virus i had called to
[1:01:44] preach on vaccine i ain't called
[1:01:45] dynamically you know i call the bridge
[1:01:47] gospel which is the good news oh glory
[1:01:50] to god hallelujah
[1:01:52] remember i think it was jeremiah when
[1:01:55] got a drama 70 years and i come and
[1:01:58] talked about two years
[1:02:00] and god tells you tell me tell that man
[1:02:03] if this number he'll die this year i've
[1:02:06] taken him out this year for causing the
[1:02:08] people to believe a lie
[1:02:10] god tell them plainly whenever they go
[1:02:12] there i appoint nebuchadnezzar to rule
[1:02:15] the whole it anybody that stay back and
[1:02:18] say they ain't going i will punish them
[1:02:20] i will send plagues i will send
[1:02:22] pestilence i will i'll do he said all
[1:02:25] what will happen in other words it was
[1:02:27] god's will for them to go down to
[1:02:29] babylon and be under the captivity of
[1:02:31] nebuchadnezzar that was god's kind of
[1:02:32] program you tell them up front let your
[1:02:35] children get married take his wife take
[1:02:37] husband
[1:02:39] plant land buy land pray for the
[1:02:41] government hallelujah because 70 years
[1:02:44] you're down there oh don't fool yourself
[1:02:46] and be deceived as two more years is 70
[1:02:48] years down there oh hallelujah but the
[1:02:50] word of the lord can't fail because it
[1:02:52] was 70 years i daniel saw by books when
[1:02:56] the time was at hand and daniel began to
[1:02:58] get desperate because he recognized
[1:03:00] something about the break please no
[1:03:02] distraction no misdirection oh no lying
[1:03:06] we have to come back to the prophet's
[1:03:07] prophecy oh glory to god just what the
[1:03:10] prophet said isn't that right hallelujah
[1:03:13] praise god
[1:03:14] hallelujah
[1:03:16] praise be to jesus amen so listen
[1:03:20] when the word is refused
[1:03:22] then they are turned to dear desires
[1:03:26] did you hear that
[1:03:28] be careful since
[1:03:30] this is
[1:03:31] perfectional
[1:03:33] this is
[1:03:34] a razor edge
[1:03:36] it has to be the word or nothing
[1:03:38] i don't care if the man looking like an
[1:03:40] angel he pushed it like an angel it has
[1:03:42] to be
[1:03:43] the word then the prophet talked about
[1:03:45] read let's reach thessalonians and he
[1:03:47] read it
[1:03:48] and turning down rejecting the truth
[1:03:50] they would be given over to a reprobate
[1:03:52] mind and would believe a lie and be
[1:03:55] damned by it
[1:03:56] and i begin to see the danger
[1:03:59] of
[1:04:00] ministers pastors
[1:04:02] presenting things to the people that are
[1:04:04] not true
[1:04:06] and causing god's people
[1:04:09] to believe a lie
[1:04:11] that is problems with god
[1:04:13] in the amplified talk about the coming
[1:04:15] of the lawless one second thessalonians
[1:04:17] too
[1:04:18] the antichrist is through the activity
[1:04:21] and working of satan
[1:04:23] and will be attended by great power with
[1:04:25] all sorts of pretended miracles
[1:04:28] and signs
[1:04:30] and delusive marvels all of them lying
[1:04:32] wonders
[1:04:33] and by unlimited seduction to evil
[1:04:37] and with all wicked deception for those
[1:04:40] who are perishing go into perdition
[1:04:42] because they did not welcome the truth
[1:04:45] but refused to love it
[1:04:46] that they might be saved
[1:04:48] therefore
[1:04:50] god sends upon them
[1:04:52] a misleading influence
[1:04:55] a working of error
[1:04:57] and a strong delusion to make them
[1:04:59] believe what is false
[1:05:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:05] now satan is going to
[1:05:07] incarnate himself
[1:05:09] from antichrist to false prophet
[1:05:12] but in the age here we go
[1:05:15] after the church goes home
[1:05:18] after
[1:05:20] he becomes a beast
[1:05:23] he becomes the devil incarnate
[1:05:26] now remember
[1:05:27] before fire fell in sodom lot came out
[1:05:30] lot wasn't ruling out umbrella and fire
[1:05:32] falling you know trying to get out on
[1:05:34] the fire you know
[1:05:35] god brought out luck
[1:05:36] before the first dropper rain fell
[1:05:39] noah was in the act
[1:05:41] before russia built the bombs
[1:05:43] the bride in glory
[1:05:45] or give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:05:49] in the age
[1:05:51] after the church goes home
[1:05:53] he becomes a beast
[1:05:55] he becomes the devil incarnate
[1:05:58] the red dragon himself can't you see
[1:06:01] what i mean
[1:06:02] he is incarnate in his people then
[1:06:05] he's got his people boned by his power
[1:06:07] talking about satan
[1:06:08] here this amazing statement here the
[1:06:10] false prophet
[1:06:12] has prophesied them right into it
[1:06:15] give them over to a strong delusion
[1:06:18] to believe a lie
[1:06:20] and be damned by it
[1:06:22] and he added here denying the word with
[1:06:25] the form of godliness
[1:06:27] wow
[1:06:28] god works
[1:06:30] his place in a trinity
[1:06:33] justification
[1:06:35] sanctification
[1:06:37] and incarnate himself in his people with
[1:06:40] the baptism of the holy ghost oh give
[1:06:43] the lord a shout
[1:06:45] hallelujah
[1:06:46] how does god encounter himself in his
[1:06:48] people justification
[1:06:50] sanctification and incarnate himself in
[1:06:53] his people with the baptism of the holy
[1:06:56] ghost oh glory to god the holy ghost put
[1:06:59] him in oh hallelujah glory to god the
[1:07:02] same thing the devil just in time after
[1:07:05] christ satan incarnates himself when
[1:07:08] jesus incarnates himself and his people
[1:07:11] the very life that was in christ
[1:07:14] is in that person
[1:07:16] what would you do if you took the life
[1:07:18] out of a great vine and puts it in a
[1:07:20] pumpkin vine it wouldn't be a pumpkins
[1:07:22] no more it will be a grape what if you
[1:07:25] took the life out of a peach tree and
[1:07:27] put it you know
[1:07:30] it wouldn't be appears no it'll be a
[1:07:31] peaches the life
[1:07:34] tells
[1:07:35] what it is
[1:07:36] and when you hear people say they've got
[1:07:38] the holy ghost and deny this word there
[1:07:41] is something wrong
[1:07:42] and jesus said if a man has my spirit in
[1:07:46] him he will do my works you want to read
[1:07:49] that sin john
[1:07:51] 14 12. do you love him today oh blessed
[1:07:54] be the name of the lord
[1:07:56] hallelujah praise god thank you lord so
[1:07:59] the prophet was given a seed he said the
[1:08:01] seed of the entire bible is what was
[1:08:03] given to sow for this dynamic bride
[1:08:05] revival
[1:08:06] the entire seed
[1:08:09] he call it one place the wheat word and
[1:08:12] i will call you the wheat word bride in
[1:08:15] other words a bride that has the
[1:08:17] original seed which is the spoken word
[1:08:20] now if i bring you words from confucius
[1:08:23] from lapsam rampa
[1:08:25] from from from buddha
[1:08:27] or what not maybe it's nice words and
[1:08:29] principles but that is not what god said
[1:08:32] some from socrates that is philosophers
[1:08:35] but when we hear thus here the lord that
[1:08:38] comes out god's mouth
[1:08:40] that is what the seed is the son of man
[1:08:43] is the soul of the good seed that's why
[1:08:45] the prophecy say what the tapes say
[1:08:48] because the spirits speak it expressly
[1:08:50] on the tapes and on the books that we
[1:08:52] could have dossier the lord in this very
[1:08:55] er
[1:08:56] listen to this prophecy like israel back
[1:08:58] in the homeland they don't know what got
[1:09:00] them back there she was automatically
[1:09:02] put back there why national force put
[1:09:05] her in her place i'm going to say
[1:09:07] something
[1:09:08] national force
[1:09:10] will put israel in the homeland
[1:09:12] national force will put the church in
[1:09:15] the world comes the churches but the
[1:09:17] power of god will put the people in the
[1:09:19] bride
[1:09:20] not you not taking vaccine put your name
[1:09:22] right that's foolishness
[1:09:24] this is the word here
[1:09:25] the power of god not even the ministers
[1:09:28] could put them in the bride
[1:09:29] not even the faithful ministry could put
[1:09:31] them in the bride it will take the power
[1:09:33] of god because god have an objective to
[1:09:36] unfold himself to reveal himself he
[1:09:39] reveals that with christ jesus he had
[1:09:41] the the preeminences in christ jesus no
[1:09:44] christ jesus have to have prejudices in
[1:09:46] a body called the bride and then the
[1:09:48] third mystery is to take it back to eden
[1:09:50] or give the lord a shout so if god don't
[1:09:54] have the preeminences how could we go
[1:09:56] back to eden
[1:09:59] let me say it again
[1:10:00] without the preeminences
[1:10:03] how are we going back to eden
[1:10:06] because we have to go to either two
[1:10:08] preeminences which is the second fold of
[1:10:10] god's threefold mystery
[1:10:12] oh my
[1:10:13] he said the power of god will put the
[1:10:15] people in the brain
[1:10:16] in a sense fight any power of god the
[1:10:18] word talk and more talk mysteries are
[1:10:20] more teaching and more teaching but they
[1:10:22] don't want to connect with the power of
[1:10:24] god doesn't that sound familiar in the
[1:10:26] last days heady high-minded lovers of
[1:10:27] pleasures what what what denying the
[1:10:30] power thereof from such turn away these
[1:10:33] are the sort that lead silly women lead
[1:10:36] with diverse loss
[1:10:38] captives
[1:10:39] you don't want the power
[1:10:41] power of god
[1:10:42] so he said now the word the world forces
[1:10:45] this way and the world forces that way
[1:10:47] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[1:10:50] which is the word of god my word is
[1:10:52] spirit and life will put
[1:10:54] the bride in a place
[1:10:56] cause she will recognize her position in
[1:10:59] the world then she's in christ will put
[1:11:01] her in a place no national force will do
[1:11:03] it now here we go
[1:11:06] he promised to send you heavenly light
[1:11:09] to ripen the word seed that would be
[1:11:12] sown for this day
[1:11:14] wait a minute brother over there's a
[1:11:16] word seed to be sown
[1:11:18] not my seed i supposed to be a eunuch
[1:11:21] i supposed to be bringing seed
[1:11:24] from the storehouse word seed
[1:11:27] to be sown
[1:11:28] and that word seed
[1:11:30] must be a revelation of the entire bible
[1:11:33] and that is why he said if that be so
[1:11:36] then the seven thunders kept the pyramid
[1:11:38] so the seven thunders has to be the
[1:11:40] capstone revelation of jesus christ the
[1:11:43] seed to make it possible for the bride
[1:11:47] for god to have the preeminences on the
[1:11:48] bride
[1:11:49] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[1:11:51] you see it
[1:11:52] so therefore the seed has to be the seed
[1:11:54] of the entire bible who knew the bible
[1:11:56] was a pyramid nobody knew that there was
[1:11:59] a hidden mystery the prophet took the
[1:12:00] seven virtues of second peter one four
[1:12:03] through seven put a pyramid and show it
[1:12:05] inside of there and say that's god or
[1:12:08] give the lord a shout nobody could do
[1:12:10] that we know about this bible but when
[1:12:12] he put the pyramid and said that is what
[1:12:15] christ is and that is the mystery that
[1:12:18] going to be in you what's the mystery
[1:12:20] christ in you the hope of glory or glory
[1:12:23] to god warning every man to be perfect
[1:12:25] in christ jesus oh hallelujah that's not
[1:12:27] for ministers only there's nothing
[1:12:29] ministers of fear there's another
[1:12:30] platinum one card a special card that
[1:12:32] the minister have because he's behind
[1:12:34] the pulpit that is there's god in his
[1:12:36] people
[1:12:37] his object is to restore his people oh
[1:12:39] glory to god give the lord a shout oh
[1:12:42] blessed be the name of the lord so he
[1:12:44] promised to send heavenly light to do
[1:12:46] what right
[1:12:48] the word seed that would be sown for
[1:12:50] this day
[1:12:52] and one time he said
[1:12:54] intellectually hearing a message your
[1:12:56] fate isn't right
[1:12:58] you have to lay in presence
[1:13:01] until it be done
[1:13:03] so he was prophesying it will take
[1:13:05] presents
[1:13:06] to write from seed
[1:13:08] hallelujah is wanting to get seed but
[1:13:11] the seed have to be right because you
[1:13:13] can't bury a green seed because the lord
[1:13:15] has shout you can't put in the ground
[1:13:17] green seed the seed has to be ripe
[1:13:20] mature
[1:13:21] hallelujah glory to god gold and brown
[1:13:25] hallelujah by the hot july sun
[1:13:28] oh get the lord i shall feel inspired
[1:13:30] this morning oh glory to god before you
[1:13:32] could go down you have to be ripened
[1:13:34] hallelujah so he promised to send you
[1:13:37] heavenly light to write in the word seed
[1:13:39] that would be sown for this day the seed
[1:13:41] is here
[1:13:43] oh give the lord a shout on that one i
[1:13:44] can hear by the turn shouting the seed
[1:13:46] is the bible jesus said so so we have no
[1:13:50] ambiguity about that what the seed is
[1:13:52] and there's only three bibles right oh
[1:13:54] glory to god i can't preach zodiac oh
[1:13:57] glory to god but god preached this one
[1:13:58] here oh glory and this perimeter is a
[1:14:00] bible too so once it gets inside of you
[1:14:03] you have the seed where's the secret the
[1:14:05] word is in the bride what what is that
[1:14:07] the seed where that come from son of man
[1:14:10] he alone is his soul
[1:14:11] oh glory to god hallelujah paul say one
[1:14:14] water one sow one water but god give the
[1:14:17] increase
[1:14:18] oh glory to god are you with me
[1:14:21] the seed is the bible why jesus said so
[1:14:23] the word is the seed that i saw so now
[1:14:27] before you can have any crop
[1:14:29] no matter if you sow the seed you've got
[1:14:32] to have light
[1:14:34] to ripen that seed or it will rot it
[1:14:37] won't do no good it will perish but if
[1:14:40] it's got seed in the ground the right
[1:14:42] ground with the right kind of sunlight
[1:14:44] it's got a right gun and he promised in
[1:14:46] the last days
[1:14:47] in the evening time the sun will come
[1:14:50] out the son would come out to righten
[1:14:53] that seed the seed is being preached
[1:14:56] all glory to god give the lord shall
[1:14:58] fear now the seed is being preached
[1:15:00] say with the tapes say the seed is being
[1:15:03] preached echo what the prophet said the
[1:15:05] seed is being preached
[1:15:10] and the son of god
[1:15:12] is ripening that seed by vindicating it
[1:15:15] and making it push out before you
[1:15:18] proving that's right
[1:15:20] do you get it oh my
[1:15:22] and there's the quote i believe the
[1:15:24] church is beginning to hear the message
[1:15:26] beginning to understand it but friend
[1:15:28] listen we have got to lay
[1:15:30] in the presence of the sun
[1:15:33] we have got to be ripened
[1:15:35] presence of the sun
[1:15:37] is connected to rightening so they have
[1:15:39] to be presence in the church not the
[1:15:41] presence of the preacher not the
[1:15:43] presence of five whole not the presence
[1:15:45] of the minister the presence of the sun
[1:15:47] that son is esso and that's jesus
[1:15:50] he said that when you when the thunders
[1:15:52] began the manifest he said then you're
[1:15:53] worshiping the living christ him moving
[1:15:56] in and out among you oh that's that's
[1:15:58] not me that's not some man that's that's
[1:16:01] that's a living christ him moving in and
[1:16:03] out bringing what presence among the
[1:16:05] people how god could be presence among
[1:16:07] the people and there's no worship how
[1:16:09] god can be present among the people and
[1:16:10] there's no atmosphere oh glory how god
[1:16:12] could be present among the people and
[1:16:14] there was no shout
[1:16:15] holy the god when jesus was coming on
[1:16:17] the on the donkey they started
[1:16:21] they say stop them stop them stop them
[1:16:22] he said if i stop them the rocks will
[1:16:24] cry out oh glory to god and when the
[1:16:26] lamb took the book nobody could tell
[1:16:28] john behave himself keep quiet john take
[1:16:31] it easy raise a little hand here raise a
[1:16:32] little hand there john say all in heaven
[1:16:34] all under the hood john was breaking
[1:16:36] through dimensions good i blessed god

[1:17:24] hallelujah
[1:17:25] oh my hallelujah praise god
[1:17:28] thank you lord jesus
[1:17:30] he said we're hearing the message that
[1:17:32] god has given us seeing the signs he
[1:17:33] showed us proving it by the bible but
[1:17:36] how the church
[1:17:37] needs
[1:17:38] needs to lay in his presence till it
[1:17:40] tenders up
[1:17:42] tend us up how
[1:17:43] people so hateful
[1:17:45] so angry so messed up leave a second
[1:17:48] fellowship with minister chase god go to
[1:17:49] church and what the they can't
[1:17:50] fellowship one another because they
[1:17:51] messed up and god put the blood of
[1:17:53] brotherly kindness and put holy spirit
[1:17:54] right on top of it i love him i love him
[1:17:56] i love him they cannot pan past that
[1:17:59] they can't jump over that they carpet
[1:18:01] knowledge look knowledge quite darkly
[1:18:03] third step knowledge
[1:18:05] hallelujah knowledge where they see it
[1:18:06] is that you die out and produce
[1:18:07] temperance die out and produce godliness
[1:18:10] die out because god gave you virtue
[1:18:11] faith virtue knowledge god has to give
[1:18:13] that
[1:18:14] hallelujah but then the seeds have to go
[1:18:16] in the ground
[1:18:18] to produce temperance go ahead and give
[1:18:19] you a temperature you have to die out
[1:18:21] and give back temperance
[1:18:25] you had our patience
[1:18:27] godliness
[1:18:29] and god is slapping brotherly kindness
[1:18:30] and you're the you ought to forgive your
[1:18:32] brother
[1:18:33] and drop your oaths
[1:18:34] with the spirit of forgiveness oh my
[1:18:37] hallelujah
[1:18:38] oh let's continue here now he said now
[1:18:40] watch until so the church needs to lay
[1:18:44] in his presence till it turns up i want
[1:18:46] to appreciate his comment for giving me
[1:18:48] an encouragement considering challenging
[1:18:50] them to challenging all to pray every
[1:18:52] day at least for one hour
[1:18:55] it could be one hour straight it could
[1:18:56] be two half hour period if we go for for
[1:18:59] 15 minutes that's just the minimum
[1:19:02] you could go more than that the minimum
[1:19:04] instead of going in your bathroom with
[1:19:05] your phone stay out leave the phone out
[1:19:07] and leave the tablet out and pray praise
[1:19:10] god pray everywhere
[1:19:12] lift up holy hands praying pray keep
[1:19:15] praying
[1:19:16] oh hallelujah i hope you're applying it
[1:19:18] you know immediately just don't
[1:19:19] immediately start to pray make at the
[1:19:21] end of the day and know you have always
[1:19:23] on the inside you can't you watch me one
[1:19:25] hour every single day you're pumping
[1:19:27] hallelujah
[1:19:28] you want god to be on your side you want
[1:19:30] god to be working with you you want god
[1:19:32] to be directing and guiding you praise
[1:19:33] god i certainly appreciate all of you
[1:19:35] making the effort to apply what you're
[1:19:37] hearing amen so watch out the holy ghost
[1:19:40] will always point to the word
[1:19:42] if it points to a creed or denomination
[1:19:45] it is not the holy ghost it is very
[1:19:48] simple
[1:19:49] he said we have this woman to know if a
[1:19:50] man points into his group or his gift or
[1:19:52] his ministry we have deserved to know
[1:19:54] that is wrong
[1:19:56] he could be a very skillful teacher
[1:19:58] preacher whatever it is once it's not
[1:20:00] pointing to christ
[1:20:02] wrong
[1:20:05] so watch
[1:20:06] if it points to a predomination it is
[1:20:08] not the holy ghost he couldn't do that
[1:20:10] it points away from his word or when he
[1:20:12] died to confirm that word and make that
[1:20:14] word a positive amen so he died watch
[1:20:17] so he could come himself into the word
[1:20:20] he is the quickening life
[1:20:22] that makes the world live again
[1:20:26] that was his purpose of dying
[1:20:29] that he could still project himself to
[1:20:32] his church and make every word through
[1:20:35] every age act just exactly the way it's
[1:20:38] supposed to be at
[1:20:39] he is the dynamics of the mechanics
[1:20:41] oh glory to god he is the dynamics
[1:20:46] who
[1:20:47] i thought man was dynamic mr dynamics no
[1:20:50] he christ is the dynamics of the
[1:20:52] mechanics the mechanics of the church
[1:20:54] what is it apostles
[1:20:56] prophets
[1:20:57] teachers and he's the dynamics that
[1:20:59] works that so he's saying the fifo
[1:21:02] ministry will be a channel that god
[1:21:04] going to use to demonstrate
[1:21:06] his dynamics isn't that something else
[1:21:09] not fifo ministry is nano press and play
[1:21:11] on a tape
[1:21:13] is not what he said
[1:21:14] he said this here
[1:21:15] he is the dynamics of the mechanics the
[1:21:18] mechanics of the church what is it
[1:21:20] apostles prophet teachers and so forth
[1:21:23] okay and it's worked by a certain
[1:21:25] dynamic he is the fire that fires off
[1:21:28] the gas he's the fire that's in the
[1:21:30] combustion chamber amen and when the
[1:21:32] world is poured over that combustion
[1:21:34] chamber he's the one that sets our fire
[1:21:36] he's the one that confirms it he's the
[1:21:38] power of the resurrection oh blessed be
[1:21:40] the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:21:42] we see nations breaking israel awakening
[1:21:45] the signs that this bible foretold for
[1:21:46] this day we see the mechanical takes
[1:21:49] things taking place now here we go the
[1:21:52] spirit
[1:21:54] the dynamics of that promised word
[1:21:57] these things
[1:21:58] you cannot see it different than this
[1:22:02] the spirit no
[1:22:04] identifying with spirit
[1:22:06] the dynamics of the promised world
[1:22:08] so you have to get out what promise what
[1:22:10] is it with promise and you know the
[1:22:11] spirit of that that is that we're
[1:22:13] talking about you know
[1:22:14] watch
[1:22:15] to get into his church where's the
[1:22:17] purpose to show off no to drive them to
[1:22:20] calvary under onto the rapture and there
[1:22:23] we are
[1:22:24] so the destination is the rapture
[1:22:27] but we have a stop at calvary
[1:22:30] before we continue
[1:22:32] there's got to be
[1:22:34] the death of a corner wheat
[1:22:37] hallelujah
[1:22:40] let me say it again
[1:22:42] destination rapture
[1:22:45] but you have a stop
[1:22:47] that stop is at the cross
[1:22:50] that's stopping at calvary
[1:22:53] don't be distracted
[1:22:55] by ministers of destruction
[1:22:57] and misdirection
[1:22:59] they don't know what to preach right now
[1:23:01] so the enemy is always outside
[1:23:04] somebody sent me some notes from a
[1:23:07] minister
[1:23:08] are you telling people who to hate
[1:23:10] telling the people
[1:23:12] who to come against who is the enemy
[1:23:14] some other truth some some other people
[1:23:17] and this is where
[1:23:19] it's so easy to identify
[1:23:23] the external enemy
[1:23:25] some people enter me as a husband
[1:23:28] in the house
[1:23:29] some people end the music white
[1:23:31] neighbor
[1:23:33] family
[1:23:35] pastor someone else that's something
[1:23:37] some is always somebody outside
[1:23:41] room
[1:23:42] room is the enemy the enemy church room
[1:23:47] the illuminati
[1:23:49] biting
[1:23:52] usa
[1:23:53] the government depresses the enemy they
[1:23:55] come in for we
[1:23:57] really
[1:23:58] that the enemy
[1:23:59] seriously
[1:24:01] my
[1:24:02] so number one
[1:24:04] god has to give you a revelation that
[1:24:06] you are a corn of wheat
[1:24:08] you are not shocked
[1:24:10] you are actually god's
[1:24:13] corn of wheat
[1:24:15] word wheat
[1:24:17] wheat wood
[1:24:20] and when the greeks the scripture you
[1:24:22] read
[1:24:23] when they came to jesus
[1:24:26] the question was sir we will see jesus
[1:24:28] they didn't access
[1:24:30] disciples
[1:24:31] they didn't have to see jesus five-fold
[1:24:33] ministry
[1:24:35] it's what jesus wanted to see
[1:24:37] they came to a member of
[1:24:40] at that time potential fightful
[1:24:43] they were just jesus disciples at that
[1:24:45] time
[1:24:46] they said we want to see jesus
[1:24:49] and those disciples correct disciples of
[1:24:51] this
[1:24:52] didn't take them in a corner and say
[1:24:53] here what let me explain them to you
[1:24:55] because you see
[1:24:57] we know him long time you know you know
[1:24:59] um you know i mean we are we are very
[1:25:02] close
[1:25:03] you know so um come and have a seat now
[1:25:05] take a seat now you want anything to
[1:25:06] drink let me explain my way to you no no
[1:25:09] these disciples correctly brought these
[1:25:12] guys
[1:25:13] to jesus
[1:25:15] savior said jesus
[1:25:17] when jesus saw them
[1:25:19] he said except a corner wait
[1:25:22] fall into the ground and die
[1:25:25] it abides
[1:25:26] alone
[1:25:28] now the reason i'm speaking about
[1:25:31] you getting a revelation of you being
[1:25:32] that corner wheat
[1:25:34] because when the holy spirit told the
[1:25:36] prophet pick up on the right he said out
[1:25:38] of a group of
[1:25:41] the true seed of the word
[1:25:43] god will present christ our beloved
[1:25:45] bride christ will get a beloved bride
[1:25:47] out of a group of
[1:25:49] the true seed of the word
[1:25:51] now the only reason he will say true
[1:25:54] seed of the word is because there are
[1:25:56] doors that will be not true seed of the
[1:25:58] word
[1:25:59] so first we have to come to true seed
[1:26:02] because remember
[1:26:04] the foolish versions are free tinkers
[1:26:07] the foolish versions are from the same
[1:26:09] cloth
[1:26:10] but when the seamstress put the cut
[1:26:13] to the pattern
[1:26:14] the pattern is the pyramid
[1:26:16] what remains is the remnant
[1:26:19] it's the same cloth but the cloth cut to
[1:26:22] pattern and that pattern is a pyramid
[1:26:25] it could be a pyramid bride
[1:26:27] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:26:30] so who is the greatest enemy
[1:26:32] rome
[1:26:33] the devil
[1:26:35] the vaccine
[1:26:36] who's the enemy you know he's so funny
[1:26:39] all the time people die in the corner
[1:26:40] virus they say we need a vaccine again
[1:26:42] when the vaccine comes vaccine come now
[1:26:44] they say the vaccine is a problem no no
[1:26:46] is the vaccine the problem it's not it
[1:26:48] no longer
[1:26:51] who's the enemy
[1:26:52] there could be lies by omissions
[1:26:55] as we say deceived by what is left out
[1:26:58] deceived by what you don't know
[1:27:01] deceived because you chose to be
[1:27:03] ignorant
[1:27:04] lazy by not studying the word yourself
[1:27:08] just trusting the man behind the pulpit
[1:27:10] instead of examining
[1:27:12] things by the word
[1:27:16] when jesus came on earth
[1:27:19] it's like a sunday school teaching this
[1:27:20] morning
[1:27:22] the three wise man bought three gifts
[1:27:24] identifying him
[1:27:27] goal
[1:27:28] frankincense and my
[1:27:30] not two
[1:27:32] three
[1:27:34] each
[1:27:36] walking with the revelation
[1:27:38] that god give them
[1:27:40] nobody looking over and say hey your
[1:27:42] goal i should have been gold you know no
[1:27:45] that's not how it worked there were
[1:27:47] three wise men
[1:27:49] each had their revelation of what they
[1:27:51] wanted to bring to the messiah
[1:27:53] first one laid on goal
[1:27:56] second one laid on frankincense
[1:27:58] the last one
[1:28:00] padang
[1:28:02] and it was taught us
[1:28:04] that those three gifts
[1:28:06] identify goal as god
[1:28:10] frankincense a service
[1:28:12] and more
[1:28:13] for debt
[1:28:15] and given a message god
[1:28:17] in service to die
[1:28:19] i want you to see jesus today a little
[1:28:21] different
[1:28:23] not just jesus
[1:28:24] walk through galilee but
[1:28:26] understand
[1:28:28] his
[1:28:29] purpose was to die
[1:28:31] and that debt
[1:28:33] was to pay the price of our redemption
[1:28:36] that we could get access to eden
[1:28:39] and return back to where we fell from
[1:28:43] there's only one way to do that
[1:28:45] was to pay the price
[1:28:46] the cost of adam failing and falling
[1:28:51] that was the objective so all jesus
[1:28:53] ministry turning water into wine feeding
[1:28:55] the multitude they were like side shows
[1:28:57] calling this one calling that one all
[1:29:00] those were just side stuff
[1:29:02] his main purpose
[1:29:05] was to go to calvary
[1:29:06] his main purpose was to go to the cross
[1:29:10] and that's why he said
[1:29:12] my hour is now come
[1:29:13] my soul is heavy
[1:29:15] hallelujah he cannot
[1:29:17] dock it
[1:29:18] he cannot avoid it he gone into the
[1:29:21] garden of gethsemane there is where the
[1:29:22] land and the tribe of judah prevailed
[1:29:24] if it is possible that this could pass
[1:29:26] but here am i
[1:29:28] i have to do it
[1:29:30] i must do it
[1:29:32] if i don't the spirit will not be
[1:29:33] released
[1:29:35] oh glory to god because the life is in
[1:29:37] the blood
[1:29:38] all glory and the blood cell has to be
[1:29:40] broken
[1:29:41] so when he died
[1:29:42] the spirit was released
[1:29:44] that is why we are here today
[1:29:46] that is why we are in church that is why
[1:29:49] in your home hearing the word because
[1:29:51] the spirit released from you
[1:29:53] you didn't find him oh glory to god he
[1:29:55] found you give the lord a shout you did
[1:29:57] not find him he found you he said you
[1:29:59] have not chosen me but i have chosen you
[1:30:01] i know being you
[1:30:03] that you bring for
[1:30:04] fruit paul
[1:30:07] ii corinthians 4
[1:30:09] 7-12 he said we have this treasure in
[1:30:11] earthen vessels
[1:30:13] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:30:15] of god and not of us
[1:30:18] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:30:19] distressed
[1:30:21] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:30:23] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:30:26] but not destroyed always
[1:30:29] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:30:32] the lord jesus that the life also of
[1:30:35] jesus might be made manifest in our body
[1:30:38] for we which live
[1:30:40] are always delivered unto debt for jesus
[1:30:42] sake that the life also of jesus might
[1:30:44] be made manifest
[1:30:46] in our mortal flesh so then here we go
[1:30:49] debt worker in us
[1:30:51] but life in you
[1:30:53] death
[1:30:54] work it in us
[1:30:56] fight for ministry
[1:30:58] but life in you the bride you were
[1:31:00] saying that clearly
[1:31:01] it takes debt to work in us for life to
[1:31:03] work in you
[1:31:04] as we die life could flow
[1:31:06] as we die word could turn to spirit as
[1:31:09] we die why periods pick these words the
[1:31:12] holy ghost fell among them that heard
[1:31:14] the word this is the prophet
[1:31:18] you find christ only in debt
[1:31:20] not in a manger
[1:31:22] not in a confession
[1:31:24] to believe a certain creed
[1:31:26] fables you don't find christ dear
[1:31:29] oh my
[1:31:30] you see
[1:31:32] he pointing them to the presence of
[1:31:33] christ
[1:31:34] he said except economy falls and abides
[1:31:36] alone abides alone
[1:31:38] he says watch it will bring forth watch
[1:31:40] i'll just read a little bit here
[1:31:42] he said no except economy falls it that
[1:31:44] buys a loan now if he did not die
[1:31:47] would have to abide alone himself
[1:31:50] if he did not die
[1:31:51] talk about christ but him
[1:31:53] being the corner we that fell into the
[1:31:55] ground and then if it falls into the
[1:31:57] ground he said it would bring forth an
[1:31:59] abundance
[1:32:00] if it falls into the ground and dies
[1:32:02] first it has to be a germanic seed or
[1:32:05] bring forth nothing but it has to be
[1:32:07] have life in it
[1:32:08] here we go before it can fall into the
[1:32:11] ground
[1:32:12] and he had eternal life in him because
[1:32:14] he was immanuel
[1:32:16] and he
[1:32:17] had to give his own life
[1:32:19] in order to bring forth life again
[1:32:22] now
[1:32:22] like the wheat you say how could one
[1:32:24] grain of wheat here's what happens one
[1:32:26] grain falls it brings forth a hundred
[1:32:28] grains a hundred grain falls it brings
[1:32:30] out a thousand grains a thousand grain
[1:32:32] falls it brings what million green a
[1:32:33] million grit falls in a badge load and
[1:32:36] on and on till it feeds the whole world
[1:32:38] that is what he meant if i live my life
[1:32:41] alone and die this way i just live my
[1:32:44] life alone well then there'll be no food
[1:32:46] after me but if i fall into the ground
[1:32:48] under the will of god i'll bring forth a
[1:32:50] new birth
[1:32:52] this is jesus now if i fall in the
[1:32:54] ground under the will of god i'll bring
[1:32:56] forth a new bird and in that new bird it
[1:32:59] will bring forth another new bird and
[1:33:01] another bird until the whole world will
[1:33:02] be missionaried this gospel must be
[1:33:04] preached in all the world for witness
[1:33:06] unto me these signs shall fund them
[1:33:08] believe so if we in ourselves then
[1:33:11] in our ministry
[1:33:14] in our torch in our life if we abide as
[1:33:18] we are we can do no good
[1:33:20] that is today that is right now
[1:33:23] he's not talking about sinners
[1:33:26] he's not talking about people on the
[1:33:27] outside he's talking about truth folks
[1:33:29] he's talking about ministers he's
[1:33:31] talking about me he's talking about you
[1:33:33] he's talking about all of us if we
[1:33:35] ourselves then in our ministry
[1:33:38] in our thoughts
[1:33:40] in our life
[1:33:41] if we abide as we are we can do no good
[1:33:45] we have got to also die at the altar
[1:33:50] or we would live alone
[1:33:52] we would live to some denomination or
[1:33:54] some creed
[1:33:56] we would lift to some organization but
[1:33:58] if we die to ourselves then the holy
[1:34:00] spirit will be spread forth everywhere
[1:34:03] by our lips
[1:34:06] hallelujah glory to god what was peter
[1:34:09] peter was in the body
[1:34:10] he didn't want to go to the gentile
[1:34:12] house of cornelius but god sent him
[1:34:14] there god sent for peter to go to
[1:34:16] paulinha's house to show him something
[1:34:18] that god don't respect her persons and
[1:34:19] peter was just testifying and why peter
[1:34:22] speak these words why we can't hear that
[1:34:24] again
[1:34:25] only talk and talk and more talk why
[1:34:27] peter yet speak these words the holy
[1:34:29] ghost fell upon them
[1:34:31] the explanation behind that peter was in
[1:34:33] the body and he had the germ inside of
[1:34:35] him full germ
[1:34:38] that it could be released out of his
[1:34:39] lips
[1:34:40] and he's promised the sons of god in
[1:34:42] last days i will have the germ of god
[1:34:44] you have to send for them to release jim
[1:34:47] fulgum
[1:34:48] how you can have full german you don't
[1:34:49] have all them seven voters inside
[1:34:51] is the whole pyramid had to be inside to
[1:34:54] reproduce christ again fulgym oh
[1:34:56] hallelujah
[1:34:58] if we die to ourselves then the holy
[1:35:00] spirit will be spread forward everywhere
[1:35:02] by our lips we have got to die
[1:35:07] that is thus saith the lord we have got
[1:35:08] to
[1:35:10] die
[1:35:10] so many today so it is now we must
[1:35:13] realize we have got to die
[1:35:15] in order to bring forth new life
[1:35:18] praise god what a message certainly
[1:35:20] appreciate what brother isaac brought a
[1:35:22] new thing a new season a new time is
[1:35:23] upon us
[1:35:24] in order to bring forth he said if you
[1:35:26] want to see me you must die
[1:35:28] this is brother branham bringing it out
[1:35:30] what jesus was telling them they came to
[1:35:32] me jesus you said i am jesus oh a seat
[1:35:34] it's so nice you want to see me here am
[1:35:37] i
[1:35:38] no
[1:35:39] they couldn't see him that way if you
[1:35:42] want to see me go to calvary
[1:35:44] if you want to see me you got to die to
[1:35:46] how you feel how you think your dreams
[1:35:48] your stories you have to die
[1:35:50] if you want to see me
[1:35:51] die to yourself
[1:35:53] and then you will bring forth
[1:35:55] a new life
[1:35:56] now if you want to see him
[1:35:58] if you ever expect to see him
[1:36:00] you will never see him by joining the
[1:36:02] church
[1:36:03] some book of laws and you keep some
[1:36:06] creed that you serve
[1:36:08] is so dangerous
[1:36:10] when these ministers
[1:36:12] present to the people that because they
[1:36:14] are in that group that they are the
[1:36:15] bride that's a lionel
[1:36:18] that's a huge lion
[1:36:20] that is not true
[1:36:22] hallelujah you have to meet god's
[1:36:23] requirement to be part of this body you
[1:36:26] have to be magnetized to the headstone
[1:36:28] oh my brother branham
[1:36:30] you will see him when you die
[1:36:33] when you come to calvary
[1:36:35] and are crucified to yourself
[1:36:38] then you will see jesus
[1:36:41] first before he said anything
[1:36:44] he pointed them to the place to find him
[1:36:46] like all gentiles
[1:36:48] all people
[1:36:49] you find jesus at the cross where you
[1:36:52] are crucified with him today we try to
[1:36:55] find him in everything we try to find
[1:36:56] him in church building try to find him
[1:36:58] any nomination try to find him say in
[1:37:01] some creed we try to find him by keeping
[1:37:03] certain days by obeying certain rituals
[1:37:05] but we cannot find till we come to
[1:37:07] calvary until we are crucified fall to
[1:37:11] the dust of the earth die to ourselves
[1:37:14] and reborn again then we fight jesus so
[1:37:17] many try to hold their own maintain
[1:37:19] their own ideas i've got my way of it i
[1:37:22] believe this but you cannot find christ
[1:37:25] until you die to yourself and accept him
[1:37:28] the word then you find life
[1:37:30] oh my
[1:37:32] so when a man gave you a green glasses
[1:37:33] you must see everything green you clear
[1:37:35] paper glasses everything purple take off
[1:37:38] that paper glasses and get that clear
[1:37:39] one
[1:37:40] all i want to see is the word
[1:37:42] hallelujah
[1:37:44] praise the name of the lord you love him
[1:37:47] let's go
[1:37:49] there he was
[1:37:50] christ he was the word god word made
[1:37:53] manifest
[1:37:54] and he died in order to pay the debt of
[1:37:57] our high breeding
[1:37:58] now there it is what is it
[1:38:00] that you could die to yourself
[1:38:04] until you are no more yourself and be
[1:38:08] filled with his word believe in his word
[1:38:10] and then the holy spirit was in him
[1:38:12] comes down to water that word to make it
[1:38:14] grow and then what is it god manifesting
[1:38:18] continuing the work of his first son his
[1:38:20] only begotten see then he died for our
[1:38:22] hybrid life that he might reconcile us
[1:38:25] back to be sons and daughters of god and
[1:38:27] true the church might flow the same life
[1:38:30] by the word continuing the work being
[1:38:33] manifested as it was in christ christ
[1:38:36] was god's word made manifest and he died
[1:38:39] give his life that he might send the
[1:38:41] spirit that's the purpose take his body
[1:38:44] up send the spirit back to water pay the
[1:38:47] redeeming price if we will believe it
[1:38:50] that is right there if you would believe
[1:38:52] it he said believe it on me the works
[1:38:54] that i do then come the holy spirit upon
[1:38:57] the same word
[1:38:58] you say where do you throw it upon the
[1:39:00] bible then the bible has got to be in
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:04] oh glory to god the bible has got to be
[1:39:07] in you which will be full truth
[1:39:09] or all truth oh glory to god in seed
[1:39:12] form in word form watch the word is a
[1:39:16] seed as long as it's laying here
[1:39:18] it won't do no good but when it comes in
[1:39:21] here when it comes into the heart then
[1:39:23] it begins to manifest by the holy spirit
[1:39:26] the works of god then visions come here
[1:39:29] we go powers come here we go humility
[1:39:32] comes all you'll know it all it's gone
[1:39:35] you become nothing
[1:39:37] christ becomes alive you die
[1:39:41] he lives there it is cause he die i live
[1:39:45] when i die he lives again so when i die
[1:39:48] he promised me to life and i died all to
[1:39:51] myself so in order i can have his life
[1:39:53] how do we do it by taking his word his
[1:39:55] seat put a seat in here by fate and
[1:39:57] believe it and it produces exactly what
[1:39:59] the bible said all you know it all is
[1:40:01] gone
[1:40:02] you know some people ask them a question
[1:40:04] they have all the answers i say i don't
[1:40:07] know i don't have all the answers you
[1:40:08] have to know when you have your answers
[1:40:10] and when you drop the answers you bluff
[1:40:12] your way through say anything to to give
[1:40:13] an answer you don't know you don't know
[1:40:15] i don't know
[1:40:16] certain days i don't know i really don't
[1:40:18] know
[1:40:19] all you know it all is gone so you're
[1:40:21] not trying to know it all
[1:40:22] humility comes
[1:40:24] powers comes
[1:40:26] vision comes do you love him
[1:40:29] no oh my they were good people they were
[1:40:31] fine people but not all that say lord
[1:40:34] lord but the one that do it the will of
[1:40:35] my father not here that starts is he
[1:40:37] that finishes there are no shortcuts you
[1:40:41] are disqualified at the end of the race
[1:40:43] that is scary though
[1:40:45] that is really really scary
[1:40:48] to be disqualified
[1:40:50] at the end of the race
[1:40:52] no shortcuts you must come the way of
[1:40:54] the scripture said repent and be
[1:40:56] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:40:58] you shall receive the gift of the holy

[1:44:07] the issue the church is the issue look
[1:44:09] again what the real issue is
[1:44:12] job
[1:44:14] righteous man he's one of the characters
[1:44:16] i want to look at
[1:44:17] quickly
[1:44:18] job a righteous man
[1:44:20] when god began to put the heat on joe
[1:44:22] because there were issues
[1:44:24] that job wasn't even aware of
[1:44:27] but isaac brought out in that bible
[1:44:29] study
[1:44:30] about job
[1:44:31] at the end then he was a more righteous
[1:44:33] man
[1:44:34] because he came through
[1:44:36] process
[1:44:37] and one of the things that was
[1:44:38] interesting though
[1:44:40] is how job under the heat tell god
[1:44:43] why don't you check them fellas outside
[1:44:45] why doesn't he send a man outside why
[1:44:46] are you checking
[1:44:48] why you interfere with me and i believe
[1:44:50] you
[1:44:52] why are you in the fair with me and i'm
[1:44:53] a righteous man why am i going through
[1:44:55] the stuff i'm going through
[1:44:57] and i'm serving you with all my heart
[1:44:59] i'm doing what is right

[1:46:10] stealing job
[1:46:12] kidnapper job he wasn't talking about
[1:46:14] that kind of behavior because that is
[1:46:16] not really christian behavior
[1:46:18] so he wasn't talking about bad self
[1:46:20] it came to the point where he was so
[1:46:23] stripped
[1:46:24] that he recognized his good self neither
[1:46:28] died
[1:46:29] he hated his good self
[1:46:31] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:46:34] blessed could we
[1:46:36] see ourselves coming to that spot
[1:46:40] how could the self-righteous
[1:46:42] in church
[1:46:44] the self-righteous
[1:46:46] in the message come to job 42 to say
[1:46:50] i hate myself
[1:46:52] when people think because their dress is
[1:46:53] longer than somebody else
[1:46:55] they're a little near the kingdom
[1:46:58] somebody just covered their knees but
[1:47:00] their own dog to their uncle and they
[1:47:01] feel everybody
[1:47:02] supposed to wear their owner the uncle
[1:47:05] hallelujah
[1:47:07] when the judge utters by dear measuring
[1:47:09] word
[1:47:10] my god
[1:47:12] isn't tristan or god tell them
[1:47:14] stop listening to your prophets
[1:47:16] your your prophet is not god
[1:47:18] professional you call them your prophets
[1:47:20] prophesying lies
[1:47:22] hallelujah
[1:47:24] so here we go now
[1:47:26] job
[1:47:28] came to that spot because there was
[1:47:30] issues that god had to sort job out with
[1:47:32] to make him a more righteous man
[1:47:35] and the other character
[1:47:37] that i saw was in jonah
[1:47:40] jonah chapter four this please jonah
[1:47:42] exceedingly he was very angry very angry
[1:47:44] about
[1:47:45] after bringing a message for the people
[1:47:46] to repent the people repent and join us
[1:47:48] still upset
[1:47:50] because he have an issue with with how
[1:47:52] god has operated
[1:47:54] he tell god he prayed unto the lord and
[1:47:56] said i prayed your lord was not this my
[1:47:58] saying when i was yet in my country
[1:48:00] therefore i fled before unto tashish for
[1:48:03] i knew that what a gracious god merciful
[1:48:06] slaughter anger of great kindness and
[1:48:09] repentancy of the evil therefore now o
[1:48:11] lord take i beseech my life from me for
[1:48:14] it is better for me to die than to live
[1:48:17] all because a bunch of people he didn't
[1:48:20] repent and he could fight
[1:48:22] he didn't want them forgive him
[1:48:24] he didn't want them to repent he know
[1:48:26] god is merciful he know god is so that
[1:48:28] way he head down the dashes
[1:48:34] fled to touches
[1:48:36] because he's no doubt gracious god
[1:48:38] merciful he's totally anger so god you
[1:48:41] know that you have a messenger boy and
[1:48:43] you come to see the message and you're
[1:48:44] hoping they repent you're hoping they
[1:48:46] make things right so long you have it
[1:48:47] for them you want to see them fall you
[1:48:49] want to see them mash up
[1:48:53] my god
[1:48:55] therefore take my life take my life for
[1:48:57] it's better for me to die than to live
[1:48:59] then said god lord does though does
[1:49:02] though well to be angry
[1:49:04] oh my hallelujah i'm going to the street
[1:49:07] no job
[1:49:08] you know it's interesting when she was
[1:49:10] in the daily wheel the belly the fish
[1:49:13] job when joe recognized is another job
[1:49:15] jonah rather said
[1:49:17] when jonah recognized his first she
[1:49:18] cried lord god he looked to his temple
[1:49:20] and he cried out for deliverance
[1:49:22] the fish spit him out right in front
[1:49:24] where he's supposed to be the nervous
[1:49:26] but you know
[1:49:27] his heart still have a condition in it
[1:49:28] you know
[1:49:29] he still have a heart
[1:49:31] that them people shouldn't repent god
[1:49:33] shouldn't forgive them you still have a
[1:49:34] heart you know
[1:49:35] god the baptist the heart is desperately
[1:49:38] wicked who can know it but god who could
[1:49:41] really know the heart but god people
[1:49:42] sitting down saying amen glory
[1:49:44] hallelujah and god alone know what's
[1:49:45] sitting inside that heart there god come
[1:49:47] and cleanse come and purge
[1:49:49] okay so let's strike the message now
[1:49:51] sorry
[1:49:53] oh
[1:49:54] thank you lord
[1:49:55] so god loved fatherhood
[1:49:57] he wanted to express himself
[1:50:00] and it was the father who became son son
[1:50:02] of man
[1:50:03] rabbi jesus keeps saying son of man
[1:50:05] he wanted to express himself that what
[1:50:07] he was one of his great truthful
[1:50:09] purposes
[1:50:10] was to express himself
[1:50:12] identify himself as human beings to
[1:50:14] reveal himself in christ
[1:50:16] secondly here we go
[1:50:17] and this is what we're emphasizing this
[1:50:18] morning
[1:50:19] to have the preeminences in his body of
[1:50:23] believers
[1:50:24] shout out home in your house wherever
[1:50:26] you are body of believers
[1:50:28] to have the preeminences in the fightful
[1:50:31] ministry no
[1:50:33] not only the minister supposed to have
[1:50:35] the preeminences god have there but in
[1:50:36] the body of believer that is his bride
[1:50:40] that he might live
[1:50:41] in
[1:50:42] people
[1:50:44] now he could do that in adam and eve but
[1:50:46] sin separated him right so god's purpose
[1:50:48] why didn't he just keep adam and eve
[1:50:50] like that
[1:50:51] then he would never be able to express
[1:50:53] his fullness his full attribute see so
[1:50:56] he was that he wanted to be a savior he
[1:50:58] wanted to be a healer and so on like
[1:51:00] that right we understand that no
[1:51:02] he said no
[1:51:04] when i see god's great purpose
[1:51:07] revealing himself
[1:51:09] and having first revealed himself in
[1:51:11] christ the fullness of the goddess
[1:51:13] bodily and then to bring the fullness of
[1:51:15] the goddess bodily into a people
[1:51:18] that he could have the preeminences
[1:51:22] the oversight
[1:51:23] the leading
[1:51:25] and from here
[1:51:26] brother branham
[1:51:28] dropped into a channel to go back to
[1:51:30] this message he preached i preached on
[1:51:31] one night a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:51:34] paul a prisoner
[1:51:37] when god gets you to be his prisoner
[1:51:40] then
[1:51:41] you can't do nothing
[1:51:44] but what the spirit says do
[1:51:47] paul with all of his great intellect
[1:51:50] he was taught by gamaliel to be a great
[1:51:52] priest or rabbi someday
[1:51:54] and he had high ambitions he was
[1:51:56] intellectually a great man great
[1:51:58] authority great man in the nation but he
[1:52:01] had to sacrifice
[1:52:02] every bit of it
[1:52:03] to become part of the word
[1:52:06] to express jesus christ
[1:52:08] he had a notion to go over some place
[1:52:10] some virgin would call him and he was
[1:52:12] forbidden by the spirit here we go
[1:52:15] to do his own will
[1:52:17] if people have spiritual can pick that
[1:52:20] up
[1:52:20] he was forbidden to do his own will he
[1:52:24] said the spirit
[1:52:25] forbid me
[1:52:26] he was the prisoner of christ
[1:52:29] now i believe
[1:52:30] the prophet dropped that prison of
[1:52:32] christ
[1:52:33] to give a little insight
[1:52:36] as to what this preeminences would look
[1:52:38] like
[1:52:40] when
[1:52:41] it is in effect
[1:52:43] then he said this here
[1:52:45] if god
[1:52:46] can get him prisoners like that
[1:52:49] that
[1:52:50] is when
[1:52:52] he can express
[1:52:54] the preeminences you see
[1:52:56] he's got the man
[1:52:57] or the person he knows nothing about
[1:52:59] christ
[1:53:01] i don't know if you'll remember when i
[1:53:02] read it when i read about sin john 15 7
[1:53:06] if he abided me and my words in you
[1:53:08] sitting on 15
[1:53:10] every tree that every branch of me that
[1:53:12] doesn't bring food food got cut off
[1:53:14] and if you bring forth food he pruned it
[1:53:15] to bring forth more fruit here and is my
[1:53:17] father glorified bring forth much fruit
[1:53:19] and i keep saying the devil is not in
[1:53:21] the picture
[1:53:22] so what we're talking about here
[1:53:24] this second full of god threefold
[1:53:27] mystery let me say it a good
[1:53:30] the devil is not in the picture
[1:53:33] rome is not in the picture the
[1:53:35] illuminati trilateral council
[1:53:38] the vaccine is not in the picture here
[1:53:40] this is what god promised to do
[1:53:43] have the preeminences no destruction
[1:53:49] if god can get in prisons like that
[1:53:53] so number one first to express himself
[1:53:54] completely god in christ
[1:53:56] so he had to come back in this age
[1:53:58] to express by all the word
[1:54:01] all the mysteries all what was lost
[1:54:03] since in genesis the serpent gardener
[1:54:05] eden right on up all the mysteries the
[1:54:08] fullness of the word to be revealed he
[1:54:10] called it the time and after the prophet
[1:54:12] died we had to endure all these years
[1:54:15] making a bright history and we call it
[1:54:17] the time
[1:54:19] of the revelation of these things being
[1:54:23] made known
[1:54:24] so there's a time of revelation
[1:54:27] and there's a time of manifestation okay
[1:54:29] so number one he first had to express
[1:54:32] himself completely god in christ second
[1:54:34] to have the preeminences by this in his
[1:54:37] church which is his body the bride so he
[1:54:40] could have the preeminences to express
[1:54:42] himself and thirdly
[1:54:44] to restore the kingdom to his right
[1:54:47] position that fell by sin by adam
[1:54:51] oh hallelujah are you with me this
[1:54:53] morning so what's his purpose now
[1:54:56] express himself in a son
[1:54:58] that in him might dwell the fullness of
[1:55:00] the goddess bodily
[1:55:02] then i've got colossians laying here
[1:55:04] now through his life
[1:55:06] through this life of this son
[1:55:08] his cross the blood it says here of his
[1:55:11] cross
[1:55:12] he might reconcile to himself a body a
[1:55:15] bride which is second eve and give it in
[1:55:18] type like he did moses on all of them
[1:55:20] the same thing he did in adam and eve
[1:55:22] given in type christ and the bride oh
[1:55:25] blessed be the name of the lord so what
[1:55:27] happened in the pre-figure now he opened
[1:55:29] adam's side
[1:55:31] and took part of his flesh which was
[1:55:32] adam to make eve the brain has to be the
[1:55:36] word
[1:55:36] for he is the word
[1:55:38] she cannot stand on a creed she cannot
[1:55:40] stand on denomination here we go she
[1:55:42] cannot stand on good behavior she has to
[1:55:45] stand alone on the word because she is
[1:55:48] part of it and she was taken from christ
[1:55:51] and to be sure
[1:55:53] that the whole rapture now here we go
[1:55:55] rapture the rapture luther was apart
[1:55:59] he was apart
[1:56:01] the prophet was apart
[1:56:02] just in the revelation that they were
[1:56:05] making up the body
[1:56:07] feet toes arms and so forth until the
[1:56:09] head which you will get in a few minutes
[1:56:11] that makes the entire rapture it's the
[1:56:13] body of the word which is christ
[1:56:16] so the prophet went down to the prophets
[1:56:19] to the churches
[1:56:20] all of that making up the rapture that
[1:56:22] is the body being formed
[1:56:24] so luther pat makes up already wesley
[1:56:25] pat mega were ready penny
[1:56:27] already it's no the weak word bride
[1:56:30] that's the final part
[1:56:32] then he said this year outside of that
[1:56:34] you are lost i don't care how good you
[1:56:36] are what your relationships what your
[1:56:38] fellowship is what your organization is
[1:56:40] you are lost outside of that word being
[1:56:43] in you not where you go to church
[1:56:46] not where
[1:56:47] you go to church not who your pastor is
[1:56:50] it got to be the word living
[1:56:52] because enoch walked with god and was
[1:56:54] not for god took him he had to take his
[1:56:56] wife he walked with god
[1:56:58] i don't know about his wife but he
[1:57:00] walked with god and his mechanics became
[1:57:02] dynamics and he was taken from the earth
[1:57:04] oh blessed be in the lord
[1:57:06] watch if you abide in me i would abide
[1:57:08] in you then you can ask what you will
[1:57:10] and you and the word are the same he has
[1:57:13] the preeminences oh gloria god
[1:57:15] hallelujah
[1:57:16] i want you to see that this morning
[1:57:19] look where you put the preeminence is if
[1:57:20] you abandon me my word are bad in you
[1:57:22] then you ask what you will because you
[1:57:23] and the world are the same he has the
[1:57:26] preeminences he's got the rulership you
[1:57:28] are prisoner to him the world is dead
[1:57:30] are you getting that insight now or what
[1:57:32] this preambus looked like so what put up
[1:57:34] on a rapture and there's no
[1:57:35] pre-eminences get up on the rapture and
[1:57:37] the bright hair hit the tapstone yet we
[1:57:39] don't want to rapture no press come down
[1:57:41] press up and stay right there
[1:57:42] press hard to chill
[1:57:44] until the bride come into action
[1:57:46] press how to wait like sun stancil press
[1:57:48] have to wait
[1:57:50] it's not press coming down i'll be
[1:57:51] looking for power
[1:57:56] per second for nothing
[1:57:58] they will come in to see how much books
[1:57:59] and tips we have in them
[1:58:01] then that's how it was in the book of
[1:58:02] acts and tight
[1:58:03] but ram says when this had a shout out
[1:58:05] and sucker like junk man they wouldn't
[1:58:06] move is it the dancing this is emotional
[1:58:08] these pentecostals
[1:58:10] they speak it in tongues
[1:58:12] and they stuck it in a like junk man you
[1:58:14] see definitely that you know you know
[1:58:16] when he divorced had to do something
[1:58:18] when peter said self and gold have i
[1:58:19] none such as i had given to you stand up
[1:58:21] rise up and walk and they might stop and
[1:58:22] walked he said he devils get up and say
[1:58:24] now we had to stop this that way to stop
[1:58:27] here something books and tips he
[1:58:28] instantly needs regular choices right
[1:58:29] now
[1:58:30] oh hallelujah
[1:58:31] so what all them churches who close
[1:58:33] already bright think about it now
[1:58:35] had churches all around the world lose
[1:58:36] them who don't have no service because
[1:58:38] our virus
[1:58:40] god set it up that way
[1:58:41] you think god didn't know that was
[1:58:42] coming the first prophet couldn't then
[1:58:44] prophesy couldn't probably say nothing
[1:58:45] considering this but this was always
[1:58:46] coming
[1:58:47] all this is rehearsal what are we doing
[1:58:49] we're not backing now we're still
[1:58:51] drawing sword we're still pumping this
[1:58:54] word because this word can fail glory to
[1:58:57] god
[1:58:58] hallelujah i like how dennis i read my
[1:59:00] books what the prophet jeremiah said
[1:59:03] hallelujah that guy was going back and
[1:59:04] he quotes from jeremiah i said 70 years
[1:59:07] i recognized two more years left
[1:59:10] for drama to start hallelujah o pray is
[1:59:13] gone so i hope this morning that you
[1:59:15] have been edified and this is helping
[1:59:17] you
[1:59:18] praise god as a taste of what this
[1:59:21] preeminences is looking like okay
[1:59:23] abiding
[1:59:25] amen the life listen
[1:59:28] we are not born surrendered
[1:59:30] we are not born yielded that's why he
[1:59:32] said make yourself a christian let your
[1:59:35] clothes be back in that knee and then
[1:59:36] always get done in prayer
[1:59:38] make yourself a christian holly you're
[1:59:40] not born a christian as many as receive
[1:59:42] him that them give a power to become is
[1:59:46] that instant
[1:59:48] it's up to you
[1:59:49] he says god will make halfway preachers
[1:59:51] but preachers could be halfway
[1:59:53] that's why if we stand alone we we die
[1:59:56] we just we alone but accept a corner
[1:59:58] falling along and die we have no further
[2:00:00] to go we'll just be grinding and going
[2:00:03] and and hitting other churches hitting
[2:00:05] other ministers as if that given us
[2:00:07] power
[2:00:08] and it's easy to do that
[2:00:10] the external enemy is the easy one
[2:00:14] blame
[2:00:15] blame blame excuses but it's also a sign
[2:00:18] of immaturity
[2:00:20] because maturity is when you accept
[2:00:22] responsibility for your actions your
[2:00:25] words your attitudes
[2:00:27] deal with it is all about you
[2:00:29] now we could do this layer of hand stuff
[2:00:31] you know as i said
[2:00:34] see imagine my ball here all of a sudden
[2:00:36] you see it here and you disappear and
[2:00:37] you see the ball appear here
[2:00:39] and all you do is little things you know
[2:00:41] and when you're looking so because you
[2:00:42] just pass it past so quick
[2:00:45] there's no magic it's tricks
[2:00:48] oh hallelujah so we're not here for
[2:00:50] tricks
[2:00:51] you are prisoner to him the will is dead
[2:00:54] praise god so let's continue
[2:00:57] unto that purple okay so g what was
[2:01:00] jesus manifested for one to show god he
[2:01:02] was god he had to be no man could die no
[2:01:05] prophet could die he was god he was god
[2:01:08] of the prophets he was the prophet he
[2:01:10] was the kings he was the history he was
[2:01:12] he that was to come he that was and he
[2:01:14] that is he that is and he is to be in
[2:01:16] this day the same yesterdays and favor
[2:01:19] he was manifested for that purpose and
[2:01:21] though that purpose and through that
[2:01:23] purpose you achieve a church that he the
[2:01:26] fullness of god might bring to pass
[2:01:28] every promised word of god in his last
[2:01:30] name
[2:01:30] when he gets the preeminences
[2:01:34] did you hear that
[2:01:36] let me say it again
[2:01:38] and through that purpose he achieved a
[2:01:40] church
[2:01:41] that he
[2:01:43] the fullness of god might bring to pass
[2:01:46] every promised word of god in these last
[2:01:49] days when
[2:01:51] he gets the preeminences in the church
[2:01:55] the position
[2:01:57] his place in the church jesus said he
[2:01:59] that believes on me the work that you
[2:02:00] shall do also even more than this shall
[2:02:02] you do for i go to my father see that
[2:02:04] was the purpose
[2:02:06] when he get what
[2:02:08] the preeminences that he could do the
[2:02:10] same work
[2:02:11] same manifestation so you see jesus so
[2:02:13] seen it he was so perfectly born for the
[2:02:16] day until god expressed every move that
[2:02:19] he made he was god's revelation god
[2:02:22] revealed
[2:02:23] now
[2:02:24] he's sanctified
[2:02:26] with his spirit and blood a church that
[2:02:30] he might make every promise in this last
[2:02:32] day be revealed
[2:02:34] now you see that word reveal if you
[2:02:36] don't watch it it might just think that
[2:02:38] it's just unfolding word
[2:02:40] but reveal these two things it can
[2:02:42] reveal by word or revelation or it could
[2:02:45] be revealed by manifestation isn't that
[2:02:47] right because god is the word but the
[2:02:49] word become flesh and that become flesh
[2:02:51] was jesus christ all right so watch
[2:02:54] he said notice he would go back and pick
[2:02:57] up all these other fellows that left off
[2:02:58] here in his last days and by his holy
[2:03:01] spirit reveal all the mystery of the
[2:03:04] seven seals see he's expressing himself
[2:03:06] for that purpose why he died that's the
[2:03:09] second fall of the truthful
[2:03:11] manifestation oh my hallelujah so we're
[2:03:14] gonna stretch here now listen close
[2:03:17] no other church
[2:03:19] no other sign
[2:03:21] let me back up a little bit
[2:03:22] he said listen close close now
[2:03:25] i do not want you to fail to get this
[2:03:28] brother branham
[2:03:29] there's some crazy mission of god reveal
[2:03:31] no other church
[2:03:34] no other sign
[2:03:36] no other fellowship
[2:03:38] no other government
[2:03:40] no other testimony
[2:03:43] no other creed
[2:03:45] no denomination is accepted outside of
[2:03:47] this
[2:03:48] god accepts nothing else
[2:03:51] but christ
[2:03:53] in you
[2:03:54] the hope of glory
[2:03:56] this is heavy
[2:03:58] the only thing that god recognizes
[2:04:00] no fellowship will i in this church in
[2:04:02] this group
[2:04:04] no church
[2:04:05] no creed no denomination everything else
[2:04:08] is dead it is fragments that has to be
[2:04:11] cut off pruned away from the thing that
[2:04:14] christ might live with the preeminences
[2:04:16] in you
[2:04:17] hallelujah
[2:04:19] because the preeminences means
[2:04:21] that we are formed into the word image
[2:04:25] because every virtue gives them more
[2:04:27] room
[2:04:28] to have the preeminences he said to take
[2:04:30] the blood of a man out and you're
[2:04:31] bringing the blood of jesus in and it
[2:04:33] brings in what the fate of jesus
[2:04:36] the virtue of jesus knowledge of jesus
[2:04:39] temperance of jesus patience of jesus
[2:04:43] brother kindness godliness brotherly
[2:04:45] christ of jesus and charity which is
[2:04:46] jesus the love of god isn't that right
[2:04:49] oh glory to god so once we begin to see
[2:04:54] the second fall
[2:04:55] of god's threefold
[2:04:57] mystery in effect then we know we're on
[2:05:00] our way to eden
[2:05:03] because eden means the third full
[2:05:06] but the second fold must be manifest
[2:05:08] which is christ
[2:05:10] having the premises so first god
[2:05:13] have the prior medicine in christ isn't
[2:05:15] that right
[2:05:16] christ have the preeminence and the
[2:05:18] bride
[2:05:19] hallelujah to bring her back into our
[2:05:21] ethnic condition
[2:05:23] which is adoption
[2:05:25] before going back to eden
[2:05:27] because adam had the command let us make
[2:05:28] man and let us have dominion adam had
[2:05:30] dominion over everything
[2:05:33] is on the earth isn't that right adam
[2:05:35] was a god man of the earth before we go
[2:05:37] back to eden that god man anointing that
[2:05:41] dominion anointing have to come back
[2:05:43] upon the sons of adam
[2:05:45] oh glory to god hallelujah of upon
[2:05:48] adam's fallen race it must come back
[2:05:51] because we have the evidence of the book
[2:05:52] restored the book the devil couldn't get
[2:05:54] his hands on which is the book of
[2:05:56] authority or the title leader of the
[2:05:58] earth of the inheritance satan couldn't
[2:06:00] get it so he is squatting on this earth
[2:06:03] isn't that something else oh blessed be
[2:06:05] the name of the lord
[2:06:06] o glory to god so the holy ghost is god
[2:06:09] the holy ghost is what
[2:06:11] is god
[2:06:12] god's life in you
[2:06:14] peter was believing unto eating a life
[2:06:17] but when the holy ghost came down in the
[2:06:18] upper room he had eternal life he had
[2:06:21] resident power
[2:06:23] not temporary power isn't that right oh
[2:06:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:27] glory to god hallelujah god want to
[2:06:30] reveal himself isn't that right he did
[2:06:32] that by the word
[2:06:34] by seven seals and by the spirit elohim
[2:06:37] spirit and elohim spirit oh glory to god
[2:06:40] to go after logos word logos word is a
[2:06:42] seed full seed full bible and you the
[2:06:45] brain and the bride have to receive
[2:06:48] these virtues
[2:06:50] by voices
[2:06:51] seven voices to seven ages
[2:06:53] god put the thunders inside of there
[2:06:55] that we could be forming to the word
[2:06:56] image a image have to be formed in you
[2:06:59] and i
[2:07:01] if you read the bible i believe
[2:07:03] revelation 13
[2:07:04] life was given to the image and to the
[2:07:06] beast and if the beasts have an image
[2:07:09] and life have to come into the image to
[2:07:11] empower the image the bright have an
[2:07:13] image
[2:07:14] the image is christ
[2:07:16] hallelujah the word
[2:07:18] the pyramid
[2:07:19] and life have to come in that image
[2:07:21] which is charity life isn't that right
[2:07:23] glory to god so he said that the word
[2:07:26] living is the bride's identification
[2:07:28] that's the bright identical to church
[2:07:31] not who your pastor is but the word
[2:07:33] living that's the bride identification
[2:07:37] praise the name of the lord so this
[2:07:41] this preeminences
[2:07:42] will display the token of god
[2:07:45] hallelujah all of this connected
[2:07:47] together the token
[2:07:48] the preeminences the works
[2:07:51] the fruit
[2:07:52] the life is all coming together all
[2:07:55] right let's hit the stretch here now
[2:07:58] but
[2:07:59] when christ
[2:08:01] jesus
[2:08:02] was being formed in mary that is when
[2:08:05] the persecution set in that is when her
[2:08:08] persecution started and it's the same
[2:08:11] thing
[2:08:12] so look at the prophet now he's going
[2:08:14] into the word now
[2:08:15] this is not devil thing and everything
[2:08:17] this is christ being formed in mary so
[2:08:20] he's switching out the galatians when
[2:08:22] christ the hope of glory
[2:08:24] is formed in you
[2:08:27] then you're going deeper
[2:08:28] christ
[2:08:30] is being formed in you
[2:08:32] when
[2:08:33] when you are dying
[2:08:36] and christ is coming to life
[2:08:39] watch the persecution setting
[2:08:42] watch trouble saturn every hand watch
[2:08:44] the devil go on a rampage when christ is
[2:08:47] being formed in you
[2:08:48] or give the lord a shout
[2:08:50] and the mystery is christ in you
[2:08:53] the hope of glory
[2:08:54] so wait a minute you mean
[2:08:56] christ have to come into life yes
[2:08:59] because the wood is a seed
[2:09:00] lifeless inside of there he described
[2:09:02] the uproam experience as dry seeds
[2:09:06] hauled themselves up into the upper room
[2:09:08] waiting for water
[2:09:09] waiting for the rain waiting for their
[2:09:12] seed to come to life and when the day of
[2:09:14] pentecost was fully come we know the
[2:09:16] story let's continue here when christ
[2:09:19] was being formed in mary quickly come
[2:09:21] the king's commandment all the people
[2:09:23] just as she was about to become in full
[2:09:25] baby ready to be delivered right there
[2:09:27] come the great persecution no here we go
[2:09:30] the baby has been formed a long time
[2:09:33] in the womb
[2:09:34] but this is coming
[2:09:36] the last days
[2:09:38] when the completeness
[2:09:39] when the fullness of the godhead
[2:09:42] when the fullness of christ
[2:09:44] is to be manifested among his people
[2:09:47] he said so
[2:09:48] stop
[2:09:49] rewind
[2:09:52] did he say that
[2:09:53] when the fullness of the godhead
[2:09:56] when the fullness of christ
[2:09:59] is to be manifested among his people he
[2:10:01] said so he promised it by the word
[2:10:04] when that fullness prophecy
[2:10:07] you see
[2:10:08] there is an unusual thing begin to
[2:10:10] happen that he promised
[2:10:13] that's the reason our social lives and
[2:10:15] things can't understand it it is
[2:10:17] foolishness to them now watch
[2:10:19] they're forming a conquest of churches
[2:10:20] prophecy
[2:10:22] just
[2:10:23] the time
[2:10:25] when the church
[2:10:26] is begin to get to its feet
[2:10:30] where
[2:10:31] the supernatural is beginning to work
[2:10:34] now they all went into the group
[2:10:36] and now they're going to try to stop
[2:10:38] this stuff
[2:10:39] so he's showing you
[2:10:41] the power behind the conquest churches
[2:10:43] will be activated
[2:10:45] when the church
[2:10:47] begin to get to it feet
[2:10:50] where the supernatural begins to work
[2:10:53] because when god was raising up ramses
[2:10:55] god was raising up his moses what could
[2:10:57] we give the lord my praises so why are
[2:10:59] they raising up welcomes our churches to

[2:12:04] any other way yet she feels it out there
[2:12:06] she knows it's going to happen and this
[2:12:09] happens then she wakes up oh blessed
[2:12:11] beating of the lord
[2:12:13] now
[2:12:14] the spirits speak expressly
[2:12:17] that in a lot of time
[2:12:19] they will depart from the fate
[2:12:21] and would give heed
[2:12:23] to seducing spirits you know what that
[2:12:25] uses
[2:12:27] a seducing spirit in the church
[2:12:30] that is clergy
[2:12:32] so this this this word here

[2:12:37] ministers he's a seducing spirit
[2:12:40] in the church that is clergy seducing
[2:12:43] clergy spirit identified working of

[2:13:59] then i'm strong yes

[2:14:09] i get everything out of me then god can
[2:14:10] come in as long as i got some of myself
[2:14:12] there then god can't get in
[2:14:16] he said we drive him away
[2:14:17] from the poorest of us to the riches of
[2:14:19] us
[2:14:20] from the least to the greatest we keep
[2:14:23] god out of our lives

[2:15:13] and do things that william branham knows
[2:15:15] nothing about
[2:15:17] that's when god can use you
[2:15:20] and when he can use any of you that's
[2:15:22] when he can use any of you he can use
