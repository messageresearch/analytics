[42:53] st. John chapter 1 we want to be from 29

[43:09] prayer for those believers that importer

[43:18] it's terrible situation we trust Court
[43:21] be their guide and comfort and help and
[43:24] shield amen praise God
[43:28] so read ins in John chapter 1 verse 29
[43:31] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[43:34] unto him and said behold the lamb of God
[43:36] which taketh away the sin of the world
[43:38] this is he of whom I said after me come
[43:42] at a man which is preferred before me
[43:45] for he was before me and I knew him not
[43:49] but he that should meet manifest to
[43:52] Israel therefore am I come baptizing
[43:54] with water and John bear record saying I
[43:57] saw the Spirit descending from heaven
[44:01] like a dove and it abode upon him and I
[44:05] knew him not but he that sent me to
[44:07] baptize with water the same said unto me
[44:10] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[44:13] descending and remaining on him the same
[44:16] as he which baptizeth with the Holy
[44:18] Ghost and I saw and be a record that
[44:22] this is the Son of God again the next
[44:24] day after John stood and two other
[44:27] disciples and looking upon Jesus as he
[44:30] walked he said behold the lamb of God
[44:32] and the two disciples heard him speak
[44:36] and they followed Jesus second Peter one
[44:40] wanna read from verse 16 for we have not
[44:45] followed cunningly devised fables when
[44:48] we made known unto you the power and
[44:51] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[44:53] eyewitnesses of his majesty for he
[44:56] received from God the Father honor and
[44:58] glory when there came such a voice to
[45:01] him from the excellent glory this is my
[45:03] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[45:06] and this voice which came from heaven we
[45:08] heard when we would he were with him in
[45:10] the holy mount we have also a more sure
[45:13] word of prophecy whereunto you do well
[45:16] that you may take heed as unto a light
[45:19] that shine it in the dark place until
[45:21] the day dawn and the day star arise in
[45:24] your hearts knowing this first that no
[45:27] prophecy
[45:28] scripture is of any private
[45:29] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[45:32] in old time by the will of man but holy
[45:34] men of God spake as they were moved by
[45:38] the Holy Ghost last scripture we're
[45:40] gonna have mark 16 was 15 to 20 Jesus is
[45:44] speaking and he said unto them going
[45:46] into all the world and preach the gospel
[45:48] to every creature 16 he that believeth
[45:53] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[45:56] that believeth not shall be damned
[46:00] and these signs shall follow them that
[46:03] believe in my name shall they cast out
[46:06] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[46:08] they shall take up serpents and if they
[46:10] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[46:12] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[46:14] and they shall recover
[46:15] so then after the Lord had spoken unto
[46:17] them he has received up into heaven and
[46:19] sat on the right hand of God and they
[46:21] went forth and preached everywhere the
[46:24] Lord working with them and confirming
[46:27] the word with signs following him and
[46:29] they got blessed his word you may be

[48:27] title is a more sure word of mercy a
[48:31] more sure word of prophecy of a subject
[48:39] changing from the Prophet to the
[48:41] prophecy another an inspiration the Lord
[48:46] Himself oh praise God the Lord Himself
[48:52] of a context scripture and you're not to
[48:55] find it is on 1st Thessalonians 4 it

[1:21:30] God know the infinite because he know
[1:21:32] where you'll be right now you know what
[1:21:34] age will be right now Oh hallelujah
[1:21:37] so therefore you are and you are you are
[1:21:40] the manifestation of his stinking before
[1:21:43] there was a world you were in Christ in
[1:21:45] God in the beginning that's make you his
[1:21:48] subjects and the whole thing is God
[1:21:50] Himself materializing himself tangible
[1:21:53] so he could be handled that is what that
[1:21:56] is the whole thing the people say
[1:21:58] interpretation I'm speaking here not
[1:22:00] long ago in a meeting among several
[1:22:01] Brannen you have the wrong
[1:22:02] interpretation
[1:22:03] you don't interpret that right we go to
[1:22:05] the Methodist say the Baptist or
[1:22:06] interpret it right the pinnacles are
[1:22:08] doing and so one is gonna song God is
[1:22:11] his own interpreter he don't need
[1:22:15] anybody to interpret for him
[1:22:17] he does his own interpreter isn't that
[1:22:20] right no Peter said when God said let
[1:22:22] there be light and there was light
[1:22:24] that's interpretation to it when God
[1:22:26] said anything it was manifested then
[1:22:28] that is God's in
[1:22:30] repetition so that the Quarian question
[1:22:33] too much just see what God said and see
[1:22:36] how its interpreted right now people
[1:22:38] agony over scripture over words and so
[1:22:42] for over dictionary and Greek and all
[1:22:44] that but that is not clear manifestation
[1:22:45] the manifestation is the interpretation
[1:22:48] so that is where the seed which is you
[1:22:50] come into being
[1:22:52] oh praise the name of the Lord so God
[1:22:54] does need anybody interpreted when God
[1:22:56] speaks and it's manifested that's the
[1:22:59] interpretation of his word but before it
[1:23:02] is manifested he sends out it as a
[1:23:04] prophecy a footage shall conceive is
[1:23:07] hang in there four hundred years staying
[1:23:10] right there they could read it they're
[1:23:13] speaking it it's got to come to pass
[1:23:15] that prophecies written for Mary that
[1:23:18] prophecy is sickling Haller that
[1:23:20] prophecy can drop down until Mary come
[1:23:22] on the scene when Mary come the prophecy
[1:23:25] hangs over Mary where does she go the
[1:23:28] prophecy going that's the version
[1:23:30] she's got ready when she's nine years
[1:23:32] old she's not ready when she's 11 years
[1:23:34] old she's has to be ready when she's
[1:23:36] ready shame and somebody and when you
[1:23:39] are ready you are ready for your
[1:23:41] prophecy which is your word there's a
[1:23:43] prophecy for you or do you believe that
[1:23:47] do you believe there's a prophecy for
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:56] so when Mary time came means I had the
[1:23:59] company have to come not the Joan not
[1:24:03] the John look at this one on that one

[1:27:04] Jesus is in lane here breaking - I am

[1:27:11] but two years old 12 years 18 years of
[1:27:17] silence from 12 to 8 18 years of Jesus
[1:27:22] in the scriptures no science no wonders
[1:27:25] no vindication no fire no nothing just
[1:27:28] an ordinary man and he's just walking
[1:27:31] down to the Jordan John see him unless
[1:27:34] that I have need to be baptized as a
[1:27:36] because you see the sign the sign said
[1:27:38] there's one upon whom see the spirit
[1:27:40] descending and remaining that's the one
[1:27:44] the less free-spirited jump on because
[1:27:46] I'm not a wolf an idiot
[1:27:48] at this rate rock rock chip threat go on
[1:27:51] so you're looking for something that
[1:27:52] remains that's Jesus it remains on the
[1:27:56] lam it remains when I see faith virtue
[1:27:59] knowledge temperance patience cotton is
[1:28:01] public kindness charity the love of God
[1:28:04] the token the spirit dynamics the
[1:28:06] capital of remain that's a house that's
[1:28:10] a temple that's the cap or give the lots
[1:28:13] of praises people
[1:28:15] hallelujah let's go a little further my
[1:28:20] so long is it all you say when God makes
[1:28:24] a promise he is lots of this would teach
[1:28:27] each what and God always sends on the
[1:28:29] scene down to the Old Testament new
[1:28:31] prophets on the word of the Lord comes
[1:28:33] to the Prophet
[1:28:34] and how does it do it it manifests the
[1:28:36] Word of God God's manifestation tells
[1:28:40] when it is right or wrong
[1:28:42] nobody has interpreted the word
[1:28:44] interprets itself God promised it and
[1:28:48] they it happens
[1:28:49] notice here from C the discrepancy an
[1:28:51] angel in verse 14 the two-spirited be so
[1:28:55] close and last days he could not depend
[1:28:57] upon some signature to separate them so
[1:28:59] he said the angels to separate them an
[1:29:01] angel is coming to bring the separation
[1:29:05] between right and wrong
[1:29:07] and no one can do that but the angel of
[1:29:09] the Lord notice he said the swords were
[1:29:13] and what the seed was the saw was the
[1:29:16] son of God who enforce wind seed an
[1:29:18] enemy came behind him which has a devil
[1:29:21] and saw the sea of discrepancy so this
[1:29:23] is a different problem now from the
[1:29:25] skiers and it's not ets the choking of
[1:29:27] the seed and so on for them and good
[1:29:29] groans and so on this is different this
[1:29:30] is where the Son of man saw the seed and
[1:29:32] the enemy came and so seed in the field
[1:29:35] and then boat jump up looking for in the
[1:29:38] fall and then I'm one sec shall we cut
[1:29:40] down no no leave them alone
[1:29:43] leave them alone and grow together until
[1:29:46] time a Havas let them grow together let
[1:29:49] them shout and say Amen together until
[1:29:51] the time of harvest isn't that right
[1:29:55] Oh Chloe no the seed of God the Word of
[1:29:58] God the word is a seed and every singer
[1:30:01] before of this kind
[1:30:02] now if the Christian the children of God
[1:30:04] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:30:08] the seed of God then they must be the
[1:30:10] Word of God the Word of God manifested
[1:30:14] in the age that they're living in so he
[1:30:16] is prophesied
[1:30:18] the children will become the seed and
[1:30:19] that money cheering becomes the word so
[1:30:22] you becomes the word no you can
[1:30:24] understand how the spirit and the bank
[1:30:25] will see come because the brain will be
[1:30:27] the width and the spirit will come upon
[1:30:29] the prey to give the rider voice there
[1:30:32] Brian have to be given a voice not just
[1:30:34] one voice seven voices will become one
[1:30:37] voice the voice of the Archangel going
[1:30:40] to be in a bride Jesus does all three
[1:30:43] the shout the voice and the Trump but a
[1:30:47] Brannan brought the shout hallelujah and
[1:30:50] prophesied about the calming voice or
[1:30:53] cloning of God hallelujah you will see
[1:30:56] the appearing of the Lord
[1:30:57] right here among us live Allah see signs
[1:31:00] one of the Merkel I can't stop it you
[1:31:02] can't stop it no man could stop it
[1:31:04] God's pocket so shall it be oh right no
[1:31:09] you on the prophecy all these yes your
[1:31:11] common is not in vain we have to be
[1:31:13] leaders no no we have a sword a prophecy
[1:31:17] we have to believe in them it shall
[1:31:20] surely come to pass
[1:31:21] Oh glory not caught in an but Noah came
[1:31:25] he was the seed of one of the of God the
[1:31:27] wood for each when Moses came he could
[1:31:30] not come at Moses noise message he
[1:31:31] wouldn't work he was a seasoned that
[1:31:33] time now we have lived to loot as H
[1:31:35] Westley H Pentecostal age each age has
[1:31:38] his promise and the people of the age
[1:31:41] that Manny says that promise word is the
[1:31:47] cedar age so our ears have a word of
[1:31:50] brotherly kindness forgiveness that must
[1:31:54] be manifested not just revealed but
[1:31:57] manifested the people have manifests
[1:32:00] that but we love the other seed of the
[1:32:03] edge because brother love is the thing
[1:32:06] that attract the Holy Ghost that's right

[1:48:21] they don't understand they rejecting the
[1:48:24] spirit because the word is wouldn't the
[1:48:27] spirit and would form so that spirit of

[2:05:01] all right is not is no money physician
[2:05:03] John had no manifestation he was just to

[2:05:08] manifestation and after 2000 years
[2:05:10] preacher of preached in the world the

[2:05:21] either light he manifested Christ
[2:05:23] there's gonna be a bride manifestation

[2:05:57] out of their sight
[2:05:58] then they said did not our hearts burn
[2:06:00] within us while he talked to us along
[2:06:02] the way brother Branham said the seven
[2:06:04] mysteries watch has done in here the
[2:06:06] seven thunders I was forbidden John who
[2:06:09] the voices and the book was sealed
[2:06:11] I skipped on this watch in other words
[2:06:13] the mission gotta be finished in other
[2:06:15] words God would be known to his church
[2:06:18] not in three people but as one person
[2:06:21] the mystery of God will reveal and when
[2:06:23] that was completely revealed then seven
[2:06:28] mysteries would open to the church
[2:06:29] because India here we go the church is
[2:06:33] his prophecy would be living under the
[2:06:36] inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[2:06:39] moving in and out showing his signs of
[2:06:43] being alive among us and then we are
[2:06:45] worshiping the Living Christ that's
[2:06:48] among us that's the prophecy there was
[2:06:50] no argument for that the manifestation
[2:06:53] of that will be the interpretation or
[2:06:55] Chloe does call them seven thunders
[2:06:57] that's the mysteries talking about will
[2:06:59] reveal Christ among us then they are
[2:07:02] worshiping the Living Christ him moving

[2:39:24] shout that was apparent he comes in the
[2:39:27] voice appearing and the third one is the
[2:39:30] Trump that's his actual claim isn't that

[2:39:36] back the faith and then introduce
[2:39:38] Messiah which is to reveal the Son of
[2:39:41] Man so it so happened that s Solomon
[2:39:43] revealed the son amount but it was two
[2:39:46] different people it won't be brother man
[2:39:47] I'm here so I'm on here but it happened
[2:39:49] to be the same person we feel in the son
[2:39:51] of man so he was 17 German Elijah
[2:39:54] Malachi for revealing look something
[2:39:57] today so William Branham as that Elijah
[2:40:00] to only reveal six seals because Christ
[2:40:02] was the seventh seal and then the
