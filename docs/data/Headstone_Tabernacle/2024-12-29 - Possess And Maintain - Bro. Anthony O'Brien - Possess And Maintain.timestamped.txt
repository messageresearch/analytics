[41:24] way when we look back at all that he has

[44:37] listening on the Internet or wherever
[44:38] they might be we pray that the word of
[44:41] God will do the work this morning uh we

[45:12] because that's what we're here to do
[45:15] amen just going to amen take my jacket
[45:18] off
[45:22] amen amen praise God just making myself
[45:27] a little comfortable here amen well we
[45:30] thank God to be here this morning amen
[45:32] amen praise the name of the Lord so it's
[45:34] a privilege to speak to you this morning
[45:36] and we have a title this morning and the
[45:39] title is possess and
[45:42] maintain as the title I have this
[45:45] morning possess and
[45:49] maintain um so quite recently the idea
[45:53] of
[45:54] Maintenance uh and upkeep
[45:57] has been a an idea that has been quite
[45:59] personally intriguing to me um more and
[46:03] more recently I'm seeing the
[46:06] value uh or the there's an excitement I
[46:09] have almost in maintaining and upkeeping
[46:13] things you know uh you a father of a
[46:16] household and so on uh you know and
[46:19] there's things that need
[46:21] replenishing there's
[46:23] consumables that uh we are using every
[46:25] day every time you start your car oil is
[46:29] being used uh you know liquids uh oils
[46:34] um you know replenishables braks
[46:37] fluid uh the battery going down every
[46:39] time you start it um all these things
[46:42] have a shelf
[46:43] life um because we live in such a world
[46:46] where we need to maintain the things
[46:48] that we have in order to keep the value
[46:52] of it see the value of it to preserve
[46:54] the value of it it requires
[46:57] maintenance it requires for you to
[47:00] maintain the things that you possess and
[47:03] more and more I'm seeing there's value
[47:04] in it uh and there's great satisfaction
[47:07] in it because you know they always say
[47:09] the grass is greener on the other side
[47:12] well that's because somebody is
[47:14] maintaining it uh it's only Greener
[47:17] because somebody is watering a little
[47:19] more than maybe you are watering and it
[47:22] just looks a little Greener and maybe if
[47:23] you did some watering yours would be
[47:26] just as green isn't that right you see
[47:30] and uh sometimes we see things
[47:31] flourishing and replenishing and and and
[47:33] bringing forth fruit but the secret is
[47:37] in the way that it's being kept the way
[47:40] that it's being
[47:41] maintained and um when your life is is
[47:44] filled with blessings or when your life
[47:47] is filled with things that that you know
[47:49] you didn't give yourself you know that
[47:52] something is keeping
[47:54] you something is maintaining your your
[47:57] stand this morning the only reason you
[47:59] came into the building this morning with
[48:02] a smile on your face and with a praise
[48:04] in your heart is because there's some
[48:06] spirit this morning that is keeping you
[48:09] from from coming off the road that is
[48:12] keeping that is holding the rains it was
[48:15] a hand of God in your life maintaining
[48:19] the blessings maintaining the presence
[48:21] upon you maintaining the glory that is
[48:24] upon your face this morning that's why
[48:27] we give him all the glory that's why we
[48:29] give him all the praise because we
[48:31] couldn't keep ourselves it is he that
[48:34] had made us and not we ourselves we are
[48:38] his people and the Sheep of his pasture
[48:43] and he is the Good Shepherd that lookth
[48:46] after the sheep and it's the shepherd
[48:48] business to make sure that you are well
[48:51] taken care of to make sure that you look
[48:54] good this morning because when you
[48:57] testify you could tell them I didn't do
[49:00] it
[49:01] myself I couldn't keep myself but when I
[49:05] went through the trial he kept me when I
[49:09] went through the darkness the cruel
[49:12] crushing an oppressive darkness
[49:15] something inside of me wouldn't let me
[49:18] give up something inside of me wouldn't
[49:21] let me let go it was God that held the
[49:26] rain
[49:28] and maintain my
[49:30] faith through it
[49:32] all can we praise him this morning
[49:35] Hallelujah for what he has
[49:37] done amen hallelujah so we give God
[49:42] praise amen and I'm seeing the Great
[49:44] Value in it see and upkeeping things so
[49:47] it's it's not just about keeping things
[49:48] clean in that sense you know like or
[49:51] making something look nice aesthetically
[49:53] pleasing and so forth like that that's
[49:55] all good and fine
[49:57] you know you polish as brother brand say
[49:59] polish the hub caps polish the rims
[50:01] polish the body but what if the car
[50:03] isn't
[50:05] working that's not really the key idea
[50:08] of
[50:09] Maintenance that is just a a nice
[50:12] look uh a night a cool
[50:15] facade um but the real the real uh value
[50:19] in maintaining something is to make sure
[50:22] that all of the parts are working just
[50:25] right cuz even if it doesn't look
[50:27] awesome we need to get from point A to
[50:30] point
[50:31] B we have a destination that we're
[50:34] trying to get
[50:35] to and on the way to that destination we
[50:38] need to maintain and upkeep our position
[50:41] our possessions in order to get there
[50:44] you don't want to get there barely
[50:45] scraping by you want to get there on the
[50:48] right foot isn't that
[50:50] right amen you want to get there better
[50:52] than the when you left and God will help
[50:55] us to do that by his grace
[50:57] is not right so it's not about just
[50:59] making things look nice you know that's
[51:01] the initial thought I had in my mind
[51:03] when I was thinking about this and it's
[51:05] about making sure that things function
[51:08] well things are are working well in
[51:12] order to serve a particular purpose or
[51:15] function the function that it was meant
[51:17] to serve isn't that right and there's a
[51:20] certain level of care and attention that
[51:23] is embedded in that word to maintain am
[51:27] you know um so it's not just simply
[51:30] managing a process you manage a process
[51:33] you might delegate duties over see a
[51:35] task make sure things are done but in
[51:37] maintenance you actually suggest that
[51:39] the object was achieved not just that
[51:41] the objective was achieve but that we
[51:43] were able to get there safely amen that
[51:46] we were able to reduce risk that we were
[51:49] able to reduce wastage you know isn't
[51:51] that right that's good
[51:54] maintenance you know that's the benefit
[51:56] of of good maintenance you know if you
[51:58] don't maintain your car properly it'll
[52:01] break down you may get a good resale
[52:04] value for it uh you know the body rotten
[52:07] in because that is one of the first
[52:09] things that guys is checked for when
[52:12] they buying a secondhand car they ask
[52:15] have any rocking
[52:16] spots um is is is the shocks good you
[52:19] know uh did it get in an accident you
[52:22] know all these things are questions that
[52:23] they will ask when you're selling a car
[52:26] because it has to be properly
[52:28] maintained and the funny thing is um and
[52:32] I can say this cuz I sold a car recently
[52:34] that um the things you don't fix is the
[52:37] things that you will have to fix when
[52:39] it's time to sell it so you feel you're
[52:43] ducking the process by not fixing this
[52:46] and not fixing that but guess what it's
[52:49] going to creep up on you sooner or later
[52:52] because you want to get value for your
[52:54] sale and people not going to buy some
[52:56] something that they don't perceive is of
[52:58] good value because it has to be properly
[53:01] maintained so there's value in the
[53:03] maintenance there value in keeping
[53:05] something well having it not just
[53:08] looking nice but functioning and serving
[53:10] the purpose that it was meant to
[53:13] serve uh and we have a purpose this
[53:16] morning and we have something we're
[53:18] meant to do and God's going to keep us
[53:20] by his grace he's going to keep us in
[53:23] his love he's going to keep us and help
[53:26] us to move from strength to strength by
[53:29] possessing and maintaining this land as
[53:31] we go into it isn't that right so I'm
[53:33] just ling a background here you know and
[53:36] um so just recently I learned that the
[53:38] Panorama ship I don't know if you all
[53:40] remember it but that was a ship that
[53:41] used to sail um you know the inter
[53:43] island ferry thing back in the day I
[53:46] think that had purchased his ship in
[53:47] 1987 this
[53:48] government and that ship became so
[53:52] rundown I think by 2004 or so it was the
[53:56] deemed inoperable to function
[53:59] anymore no one could carry could be on
[54:02] the vessel it wasn't safe to be on the
[54:04] vessel by 2004 so that just gives you a
[54:08] picture of what kind of Maintenance was
[54:11] being done on such a
[54:13] vessel uh however recently I discovered
[54:16] that that vessel is currently carrying
[54:18] people from inter island Greece uh Ferry
[54:22] uh work and it's just so happened that
[54:25] when they all government sold the vessel
[54:27] I guess to Greece they renovated the
[54:30] ship now the ship has seating areas it
[54:33] has a barroom it has it has a restaurant
[54:36] it it serves people it has fully air
[54:38] conditioned uh it has a television it
[54:41] has a lobby area um it is in a way
[54:44] better condition than it ever was when
[54:47] it was here in
[54:49] 2004 um so that just goes to show that
[54:52] when something is in the right hands uh
[54:55] uh you see the value of the
[54:57] difference um upon the
[55:00] thing whoever is doing the
[55:03] maintenance um once they could put the
[55:05] right care and attention behind it it
[55:08] will look and it will feel like the
[55:11] person who is behind it that's why God
[55:14] takes his Shepherd business very
[55:18] seriously amen our precious brother deun
[55:21] ministered to us that on the convention
[55:22] isn't that right and when when the
[55:25] devil's got you oh you know when the
[55:27] devil's got some people they got that
[55:29] look on their face they all drawn down
[55:33] can't praise God they all messed up in
[55:35] their mind but when God is maintaining
[55:38] you you got a praise upon your lips you
[55:41] got a two-edged sword in your hand you
[55:44] have confidence to come boldly Before
[55:47] the Throne and ask of God concerning
[55:50] your family you understand your position
[55:53] as a priest of your home to make
[55:56] offerings for your family and say Lord I
[55:59] need you one more time because I can't
[56:02] do it on my own but because you are the
[56:05] one that's keeping me you are the one
[56:07] that's keeping my feet from falling you
[56:10] are the one that's keeping my household
[56:12] you are the one that's providing for my
[56:15] every need according to your riches in
[56:19] glory and I come to you because you're
[56:22] doing the
[56:24] maintaining and he is very good at what
[56:27] he does uh he doesn't do a halfway
[56:31] job he does a complete job we can be
[56:35] halfway uh but God isn't halfway and we
[56:39] certainly appreciate God for that today
[56:41] isn't that right
[56:43] amen
[56:45] amen amen so in heaven everything is
[56:48] fixed right in heaven everything is in a
[56:51] permanent state so if someone were to
[56:53] die and pass on from this life there is
[56:56] no more opportunity for change isn't
[56:58] that right which means that in this
[57:00] Earthly realm we are presented this
[57:03] morning with the opportunity for
[57:06] change is that right that's what we're
[57:09] here this morning to do to find out how
[57:13] we can change and change for the
[57:16] better uh at least that's what I think
[57:18] we have in our hearts this morning
[57:21] because you can change either for the
[57:23] better or for the worst when you come
[57:25] into the present of God and so we don't
[57:28] want to be drawn away from him this
[57:29] morning but we want to be drawn more
[57:32] closer to him this morning as we near
[57:35] the pyramid and as we uh uh Feast on his
[57:37] word we ought to be
[57:39] reflecting the one who's doing the
[57:41] maintenance work the one who's keeping
[57:44] us and and helping us along the way is
[57:48] now right and then when that happens
[57:50] your life becomes a testimony of the man
[57:53] that's doing the work your life becomes
[57:55] a
[57:56] reflection you become God's
[57:59] portfolio because whenever you question
[58:02] whether God can do the job or not God
[58:04] should be able to point at you and say
[58:07] look here's my son here's my daughter
[58:11] here's my spirit flowing freely here's
[58:15] one I can put my hand
[58:17] on here's one I can use in 2025 coming
[58:23] oh Hallelujah they've got my word and
[58:26] they are willing to perform it one
[58:29] little none from God and away we go
[58:33] because we want these virtues in Us by
[58:36] the grace of God Amen to do the will of
[58:39] God isn't that right so being here this
[58:42] morning we are presented with the
[58:43] opportunity for
[58:44] change in an Ever Changing ever evolving
[58:48] landscape of
[58:49] Life a a landscape that is constantly
[58:53] shifting change is happening constantly
[58:56] around
[58:57] us and the way life was 20 years ago is
[59:01] not the same as it was today isn't that
[59:03] right the way people communicate just 20
[59:05] years ago 2004 to now look at how much
[59:09] things have changed look at how rapid
[59:11] the technology has become it would just
[59:14] been a May thought for us to think of
[59:15] self-driving cars and all these things
[59:18] but it's a reality today artificial
[59:21] intelligence and all these technologies
[59:23] have made certain things a reality today
[59:26] that was not a reality just 20 years ago
[59:30] and so it's constantly changing so we
[59:33] have to keep up with all these
[59:36] changes or we will end up getting left
[59:39] behind isn't that right and it means
[59:42] that in this atmosphere this realm that
[59:44] we live in you don't have to maintain
[59:46] things in heaven everything is in a
[59:48] perfect state but here where we live
[59:51] here now we have to maintain the things
[59:54] that we possess and develop a key sense
[59:58] of
[59:59] responsibility for the things that are
[1:00:01] important or we will actually find
[1:00:04] ourselves one day wasting
[1:00:07] away and life will end up leaving us
[1:00:10] behind because we have not kept up with
[1:00:13] the race isn't that right hallelujah
[1:00:16] praise God and the Bible says if you
[1:00:18] can't run with the footman if you run
[1:00:20] with a footman and and and they wey you
[1:00:23] then how are you going to keep up with
[1:00:25] horses isn't that right you have to be
[1:00:27] able to keep up with the pace of life
[1:00:30] and the way it's moving and God by his
[1:00:34] grace will give us the strength to do
[1:00:36] that the prophet talk about moving from
[1:00:38] the horse and buggy to the automobile
[1:00:40] moving from the automobile to the
[1:00:42] airplane and to the astronaut age and he
[1:00:44] said the Church of God ought to be
[1:00:46] advancing and progressing and getting
[1:00:49] better but some of us are loling some of
[1:00:52] us are are dazing around some of us are
[1:00:55] saying the Lord delay his coming and are
[1:00:58] doing other things or finding other
[1:01:01] things to do rather than being diligent
[1:01:05] about about maintaining the things that
[1:01:08] God had given us in our hands to to to
[1:01:11] deal with isn't that right if we don't
[1:01:15] take a bath you will find yourself dirty
[1:01:18] one day CU you need to maintain yourself
[1:01:21] you need to cut your nails you need to
[1:01:23] do basic things isn't that right that's
[1:01:25] because in this realm we live in there's
[1:01:27] a value behind maintaining things the
[1:01:31] Bible speaks of uh possessing the land
[1:01:34] of your inheritance right so we talking
[1:01:36] about possession and maintain amen uh
[1:01:40] right so in Genesis 22 he says and and
[1:01:42] he said by myself have I sworn say the
[1:01:45] Lord for because thou has done this
[1:01:48] thing this is God speaking to Abraham
[1:01:50] after he had offered up his son Isaac he
[1:01:53] said be for because thou has done this
[1:01:55] thing
[1:01:56] and have not withheld thy son thine only
[1:02:00] son that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:02:03] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[1:02:06] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[1:02:10] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[1:02:13] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:02:18] enemies and in thy seed shall all the
[1:02:21] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:02:24] thou Hast obeyed my voice oh Hallelujah
[1:02:27] so right there God pronounced the
[1:02:30] blessing the power of possession that's
[1:02:34] right upon the seed of God upon the Seed
[1:02:37] of Abraham that was to come forth from
[1:02:40] generation to generation God had
[1:02:42] pronounced a blessing of possession upon
[1:02:46] every seed and today we believe that we
[1:02:50] are the Royal Seed of Abraham we have
[1:02:54] been connected to This Promise through
[1:02:57] the shed blood of Jesus Christ which
[1:03:00] means you and I here this morning have
[1:03:04] an opportunity to have this same
[1:03:07] possession this same Hallelujah the same
[1:03:11] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:03:14] is promised to come upon you and just
[1:03:17] like he conquered you also will conquer
[1:03:21] and just like he possessed you also will
[1:03:24] possess your individual
[1:03:28] inheritance whatever God has for you you
[1:03:31] are going to possess it because that's
[1:03:34] the promise that has been pronounced
[1:03:37] upon every seed of God in here this
[1:03:41] morning do you believe it oh the devil
[1:03:45] would have you to be ignorant of that oh
[1:03:48] but we are not ignorant of the Satan and
[1:03:51] his devices this morning we come to
[1:03:54] preach knowledge we come to preach truth
[1:03:57] we come to preach Revelation that God
[1:03:59] has given us the power this morning to
[1:04:03] possess our inheritance to possess what
[1:04:06] belongs to us to possess what rightfully
[1:04:10] belongs to us this morning every healing
[1:04:14] belongs to you this morning your
[1:04:17] deliverance your breakthrough the
[1:04:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh and Fire
[1:04:25] reviv rival in the church belongs to you
[1:04:28] this morning it is yours for a
[1:04:33] possession can we praise him oh
[1:04:37] hallelujah oh I'm so happy about that oh
[1:04:42] hallelujah hallelujah he died didn't he
[1:04:46] die but when he rose again Victorious he
[1:04:49] didn't just rise to save me but he rose
[1:04:52] to put my to take the name on my on the
[1:04:55] book amen and to give me an
[1:04:58] inheritance according to what is written
[1:05:01] in
[1:05:02] there amen amen there's an
[1:05:05] inheritance connected to your
[1:05:08] name
[1:05:10] amen amen isn't that right so God wants
[1:05:14] us to possess the land isn't that right
[1:05:17] I believe he also wants us to maintain
[1:05:19] it God give us the landu but we have to
[1:05:23] fight for it amen we have to fight for
[1:05:27] the land it's not good enough to say God
[1:05:30] has given us a land but what are we
[1:05:32] doing about what he has pronounced over
[1:05:35] us what his word has already declared we
[1:05:39] have to now do something for something
[1:05:42] to happen in these last days do you
[1:05:45] believe it and that fight can be broken
[1:05:48] down into two phases possess and
[1:05:51] maintain first we fight to possess then
[1:05:55] we fight to maintain what we have
[1:05:58] possessed isn't that right and little by
[1:06:01] little you will make progress as you
[1:06:04] progress into this into this war
[1:06:07] tactic so what we're talking about here
[1:06:09] now is kind of like a strategy for
[1:06:12] Success so the more you get in there is
[1:06:15] you cut down land and you maintain it
[1:06:19] and keep it and he that is faithful in
[1:06:21] little will be faithful in much because
[1:06:24] little by little little is the secret
[1:06:27] embedded in the v the victory is
[1:06:28] embedded in that secret of little by
[1:06:31] little isn't that right when an army
[1:06:34] goes into battle they are fighting for
[1:06:37] territory they are fighting for a space
[1:06:40] they are fighting they are fighting they
[1:06:42] are Waring factions heading against each
[1:06:44] other but they are fighting to capture
[1:06:46] the flag they are fighting to capture
[1:06:49] the city am this is The Benchmark for
[1:06:52] their Victory that's right this is what
[1:06:54] they're setting up as We Know we've
[1:06:55] progressed and advanced when we're able
[1:06:58] to capture the land capture the city but
[1:07:01] what good would it do an army if they go
[1:07:03] in and possess the land and don't
[1:07:06] maintain it they will lose it just as
[1:07:09] fast as they got it if they don't have a
[1:07:12] strategy to maintain what they have
[1:07:14] possessed as soon as they possess a
[1:07:17] territory they have to set up an outpost
[1:07:20] set up a watchtower set up a fence set
[1:07:23] up guards because the enemy is not going
[1:07:26] to take it lying down they are currently
[1:07:29] regrouping themselves to launch an
[1:07:32] attack to get back what they think is
[1:07:34] theirs and so it's a constant battle
[1:07:37] back and forth between War space and
[1:07:41] territory and infiltration it's a
[1:07:44] constant moving shifting landscape and
[1:07:47] you have to keep up with it so that's
[1:07:50] why when you possess set up a watchtower
[1:07:53] set up an outpost fence your area and
[1:07:56] make sure the enemy does not come back
[1:07:59] and if he did does drive them out
[1:08:03] because this land belongs to us and we
[1:08:06] are well able to take the land that God
[1:08:09] had promised us in the last days
[1:08:12] hallelujah if you lost your joy get it
[1:08:15] back and when you get it back maintain
[1:08:18] it put a mind field around it and say
[1:08:21] Satan I dare you to cross that line I'll
[1:08:24] chop you your head
[1:08:27] off hallelujah mean business with the
[1:08:31] Enemy hallelujah hallelujah and keep
[1:08:34] what you have
[1:08:36] possessed hallelujah
[1:08:39] hallelujah
[1:08:41] hallelujah as a man does in his heart so
[1:08:43] is he and if you believe that that land
[1:08:46] belongs to you if you believe this
[1:08:48] morning that healing belongs to you that
[1:08:51] Deliverance belongs to you that
[1:08:53] breakthrough belongs to you not only you
[1:08:56] but your family but your husband but
[1:08:58] your wife but your children but your
[1:09:01] finances but your business but your job
[1:09:04] but your community whatever you want ask
[1:09:07] what they want in my name and it shall
[1:09:10] be given if you believe this morning oh
[1:09:14] then you can possess
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] it and you can maintain
[1:09:20] it and keep
[1:09:22] it isn't that right Jesus said he that
[1:09:26] loveth his life in this world shall lose
[1:09:29] it but he that hateth his life in this
[1:09:32] world shall keep it until life eternal
[1:09:37] isn't that right isn't that right it
[1:09:39] means you're building your hopes on
[1:09:41] things Eternal and if that is what you
[1:09:44] maintain then you are here what you are
[1:09:47] somewhere else so when you get there you
[1:09:50] get to keep what you've maintained you
[1:09:53] get to keep your blessing keep your Holy
[1:09:55] Ghost keep your inheritance you get to
[1:09:58] keep your
[1:09:59] virtues because you've built on a
[1:10:03] foundation of Jesus Christ isn't that
[1:10:06] right oh my that's wonderful so it's a
[1:10:10] it's possible so it is possible to
[1:10:12] maintain something and not possess it I
[1:10:16] want us to just entertain that thought
[1:10:17] for two seconds it is possible to
[1:10:20] maintain something and it's not yours
[1:10:23] this is like in the case of Moses when
[1:10:25] he was taking care of jetro's flock uh
[1:10:28] it wasn't his flock they might have been
[1:10:30] well taken care of um but it wasn't his
[1:10:35] uh he couldn't leave with the flock when
[1:10:36] he went down to Egypt you had to leave
[1:10:38] that behind and you had to follow and
[1:10:40] pursue after God's purpose isn't that
[1:10:43] right isn't that right and uh uh uh
[1:10:47] isn't that right and and likewise even
[1:10:49] the children of Israel at that time
[1:10:51] found themselves building a city
[1:10:54] building Egypt Brick by Brick slave by
[1:10:58] slave whip by Whip and yet they didn't
[1:11:00] own any of it they couldn't they
[1:11:03] couldn't lay claim to Egypt it wasn't
[1:11:06] their land they were just sojourning
[1:11:09] through there uh but God had a place for
[1:11:12] them and that's why God wanted to take
[1:11:15] them out of that place because the work
[1:11:17] that they were doing wasn't for them it
[1:11:20] was for somebody else but God wanted
[1:11:23] them to have their own amen their own
[1:11:25] Nation their own crops their own
[1:11:29] successes their own victories their own
[1:11:32] battles their own failur their own
[1:11:34] trials isn't that right you want to
[1:11:36] bring them to a place of
[1:11:38] enlargement that would require some
[1:11:40] level of maturity and pain but it will
[1:11:44] help them to grow and get better and
[1:11:47] come into their own God likes that kind
[1:11:50] of Independence thing where he can say
[1:11:53] here's my beloved Son
[1:11:55] in whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[1:11:59] this is what he had in the Garden of
[1:12:00] Eden when he had Adam he had someone he
[1:12:02] could turn his back on and know that
[1:12:05] things are being maintained things are
[1:12:08] running well uh and that he could catch
[1:12:10] a report in the evening and Adam would
[1:12:13] say I I fixed this I I moved that
[1:12:16] because I felt it was more efficient
[1:12:18] that way and he would say Well done my
[1:12:21] son uh you have done well in the Garden
[1:12:23] today lay down and rest because I am
[1:12:27] pleased with your work I am pleased with
[1:12:30] your progress and that's the kind of
[1:12:32] thing God likes so sweltering down there
[1:12:35] in Egypt apart from them being under
[1:12:37] cruel task Masters part of the issue
[1:12:40] with God is that they were not in their
[1:12:42] own place uh they were not in their own
[1:12:45] space in their own land where they could
[1:12:48] really truly see the hand of God and
[1:12:51] claim their own victories and their own
[1:12:54] possession isn't that right amen amen so
[1:12:58] so so it gave great joy to God to pull
[1:13:02] his people out of that condition and to
[1:13:04] bring that into his land a land of
[1:13:06] promise isn't that right oh my so it's
[1:13:09] possible to uh to possess something now
[1:13:12] it's possible to possess something and
[1:13:14] not maintain it here's the other flip
[1:13:16] side so you can maintain something and
[1:13:18] not possess it you could also possess
[1:13:20] something and not maintain it it's
[1:13:23] possible to own something and not upkeep
[1:13:25] it bit am isn't that right talked about
[1:13:29] uh you see an abandoned house sometimes
[1:13:31] it's so sad you walk by and you see a
[1:13:33] house that is uh there's no one living
[1:13:36] in it and you could tell because it
[1:13:39] looks like just a warped relic of its
[1:13:41] former glorious State now it is wilting
[1:13:45] away uh the floor is not swept the
[1:13:48] cobwebs are taken over uh the leaves are
[1:13:51] all in the front porch and there's no
[1:13:53] one there to sweep and to make sure this
[1:13:55] house looks in a condition it's almost
[1:13:57] like the soul of the house is gone
[1:14:00] because there are no occupants in the
[1:14:01] house and it's just abandoned and it
[1:14:04] just looks run down because no one is
[1:14:07] maintaining this possession it probably
[1:14:10] has good potential maybe the foundation
[1:14:12] is solid the wall structures might be
[1:14:15] well built the windows are are really
[1:14:17] good uh solid uh a framework the roof
[1:14:20] might be in a wonderful condition but it
[1:14:23] just doesn't look like what it ought to
[1:14:25] because there's no one keeping it
[1:14:27] looking good uh keeping the pipes
[1:14:30] running well making sure the electricals
[1:14:33] in the house are working no one is in it
[1:14:35] doing that and so it's almost like the
[1:14:38] soul of the house is just gone from it
[1:14:41] and it's in darkness while everyone else
[1:14:43] is in light uh because of its condition
[1:14:46] sometimes people end up in this kind of
[1:14:48] a condition because they don't maintain
[1:14:52] their faith they don't maintain the
[1:14:54] blessings of God if you are praying
[1:14:57] every day and you are reading your Bible
[1:14:59] then is impossible for the light of God
[1:15:02] to go out of your life moreover the
[1:15:04] light of God will begin to increase in
[1:15:07] your life if you are feasting on the
[1:15:10] word hallelujah then the blessings of
[1:15:12] God will be seen upon you because God
[1:15:15] has something he could work through and
[1:15:17] he can work through his word he can work
[1:15:21] through prayer prayer changes things it
[1:15:25] changes us it changes situations isn't
[1:15:29] that right and so it's all about upkeep
[1:15:31] you see uh so it's possible to have a
[1:15:35] possession and it not being properly
[1:15:37] maintained isn't that right so God wants
[1:15:39] us to exercise fate you believe that
[1:15:42] faith not only to possess but also to
[1:15:45] maintain or keep your position of
[1:15:48] victory until the next battle because it
[1:15:52] doesn't stop there you have to keep
[1:15:55] fighting there is much more land to be
[1:15:59] possessed so do not be slack concerning
[1:16:02] your promise as some men count slackness
[1:16:06] our God is Not slack oh so therefore we
[1:16:09] will arise this morning and we will
[1:16:11] possess and maintain what we have
[1:16:14] possessed until the coming of the Lord
[1:16:16] can you believe it amen
[1:16:19] hallelujah from next battle to next
[1:16:21] battle we keep fighting until he come we
[1:16:24] keep fighting
[1:16:26] until he comes amen hallelujah isn't
[1:16:28] that right one time they told an army
[1:16:30] you have to hold here you have to hold
[1:16:32] the line because we're going to send for
[1:16:34] reinforcements but at the dawn of the
[1:16:36] light we will be there we we promise to
[1:16:38] be there but you have to hold it down
[1:16:40] you have to keep the enemies off the
[1:16:42] gates hard battle all night long they're
[1:16:44] fighting they're fighting praise God
[1:16:46] hallelujah but they have to hold the
[1:16:47] line they have to hold the fort they
[1:16:50] have to maintain what they have
[1:16:52] possessed they can't let the gates be
[1:16:54] breached so every man to his post every
[1:16:57] man to the gate barricade the doors get
[1:17:00] rocks get trees get Stones if you have
[1:17:03] to but keep the enemy off until our Lord
[1:17:07] comes and brings his deliverance we
[1:17:09] going to stay here on the battlefield
[1:17:13] until he come oh Hallelujah don't give
[1:17:18] the enemy an inch oh bring your Shields
[1:17:21] oh the shields of the earth belong unto
[1:17:23] our God make line with those Shields
[1:17:26] don't let him come through amen amen
[1:17:30] amen hallelujah sometimes that's what
[1:17:33] you have to
[1:17:34] do God will bring his Deliverance you
[1:17:37] have to do the maintaining part Keeping
[1:17:40] the Faith God give you a promise God
[1:17:43] told Abraham you're going to have a son
[1:17:45] he had to maintain that fate for 25
[1:17:49] years un believing no evidence no stray
[1:17:54] of Lights to to show that there would be
[1:17:56] a son all he had was a word from God a
[1:18:00] god promise and he had to maintain that
[1:18:03] promise year in year out 2022 2023 2024
[1:18:10] he had to maintain his faith until God
[1:18:14] promised Revival until God promised
[1:18:17] Dynamics pours out upon them they had to
[1:18:20] maintain their faith oh is that what
[1:18:22] we're doing here this morning oh
[1:18:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:27] hallelujah
[1:18:29] glory god spoke to Simeon you're going
[1:18:33] to see the Lord's Christ you shall not
[1:18:35] see death what did he do he maintained
[1:18:37] that faith I'm not going to die until I
[1:18:40] see the Lord's Christ year in year out
[1:18:44] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:18:46] he kept getting older but one day God
[1:18:48] come down one day that Messiah was born
[1:18:52] and the thing that he was waiting for
[1:18:55] come to pass isn't that right oh
[1:18:59] my soam says here on fate so in the big
[1:19:03] campaigns we try to get that in and he
[1:19:05] said in my tent I'm going to try to do
[1:19:07] it myself in the afternoon service give
[1:19:11] the
[1:19:12] instructions of how to approach how to
[1:19:16] maintain your healing just as much to
[1:19:19] know how to maintain it as it is to
[1:19:23] receive it Prophet saying this here and
[1:19:26] I this is wonderful so the same Faith
[1:19:28] you have to receive your healing is the
[1:19:31] same Faith you have to exercise and use
[1:19:34] to maintain the healing that you receive
[1:19:38] or it is very possible the devil will
[1:19:40] run in and take it away from you because
[1:19:42] he doesn't want you to be healed the war
[1:19:45] doesn't end when you get the healing the
[1:19:48] war now start oh but you have to keep it
[1:19:52] and stay with that word that he gave
[1:19:55] you until you see the
[1:19:58] Fulfillment the fullness of what he has
[1:20:01] said and spoken isn't that right over
[1:20:04] your life so I see it as a strategy to
[1:20:06] overcome possess and
[1:20:08] maintain and I hope you see it too Amen
[1:20:11] to increase in the stature of God see
[1:20:14] the stature of a perfect man not only to
[1:20:15] possess but to maintain and upkeep what
[1:20:18] you have possessed in order to grow from
[1:20:21] Victory to Victory Exodus 23 tells us
[1:20:24] that God could not give us the could
[1:20:27] give us the land in one year he could
[1:20:30] cuz that's what the that's what the
[1:20:31] that's what the scripture said right
[1:20:32] what we read just now it said that God
[1:20:35] could give us the land in one year if he
[1:20:37] were to do so the land would become
[1:20:39] desolate let's read that back Exodus
[1:20:42] 23:29 says I will not drive them out
[1:20:44] from before thee in one year right right
[1:20:47] lest the land become desolate and the
[1:20:50] beasts of the field multiply against
[1:20:53] thee in other words he could give you
[1:20:55] the whole thing on a silver platter but
[1:20:57] he knows that it will overwhelm you
[1:21:00] because it is too much you can't eat all
[1:21:04] that on that plate by yourself it's too
[1:21:08] much it it will it will overwhelm you
[1:21:10] you're not at the State of Mind a
[1:21:13] maturity to handle that kind of blessing
[1:21:17] so sometimes you have to work with your
[1:21:18] little by little so that you could gain
[1:21:21] confidence in yourself in knowing and
[1:21:24] practicing the word of God so that you
[1:21:26] could get Victory out of Victory so that
[1:21:28] you can enlarge your mind to the
[1:21:30] blessing he has for you because no eye
[1:21:33] has seen or no ears have heard what God
[1:21:36] has in store for us God has something
[1:21:38] really wonderful but he he's got to
[1:21:40] train you for it he's got to get you
[1:21:43] ready for it I heard a preacher say one
[1:21:45] time he said if a they put a a small man
[1:21:49] in a big place what usually happens is
[1:21:51] that small man will break that big place
[1:21:55] down to how small he is but if you put a
[1:21:58] big man in a small place he going to
[1:22:02] build that place up into how big he is
[1:22:06] it has to do with your mindset if you're
[1:22:09] thinking too small you're going to do
[1:22:11] things in a in a Pity in a in a Pity way
[1:22:13] isn't that right God have to enlarge
[1:22:15] your mind and increase your borders
[1:22:17] little by little so that as you grow the
[1:22:20] things around you benefit as well the
[1:22:24] people and the things connected to you
[1:22:26] benefit from that growth because you're
[1:22:29] in a place of influence where God could
[1:22:31] use your life uh not only bless itself
[1:22:35] but to bless others to help others along
[1:22:38] the way that's the point of Christianity
[1:22:41] isn't it uh eternal life is living for
[1:22:45] others isn't that right okay interesting
[1:22:48] that he says now the Beast of the field
[1:22:50] would multiply against thee that's
[1:22:52] interesting it means the Beast of the
[1:22:53] field now thees of field we know it
[1:22:56] could be used for many things right so
[1:22:59] meat for food skin for clothing Hooves
[1:23:03] horns and other parts could be used as
[1:23:05] useful things so for instance the
[1:23:07] chauffeur that they blew as a horn was
[1:23:09] actually a Ram's Horn isn't that right
[1:23:12] it's what they use for a trumpet so the
[1:23:14] beasts of the field represent uh things
[1:23:16] that useful things that could be used
[1:23:18] but God is saying that this could
[1:23:21] actually become the kind of situation
[1:23:23] where it could be come too much for you
[1:23:26] in other words that what God left in the
[1:23:28] land for you for a blessing could
[1:23:31] actually turn against you if you don't
[1:23:34] know how to maintain what God has
[1:23:36] blessed you with in other words you
[1:23:39] could stand to lose the things that you
[1:23:42] do not
[1:23:43] maintain that's right I'll say that
[1:23:45] again just so it don't fly over your
[1:23:46] head you stand to lose the things that
[1:23:49] you do not
[1:23:50] maintain and this is where brother ID
[1:23:52] would always say time and time again he
[1:23:54] say you know how we he would pray that
[1:23:56] God would not give him more than he
[1:23:58] could effectively manage or handle I'm
[1:24:01] sure you heard him say that once yeah
[1:24:03] amen and it's so true and uh and this is
[1:24:06] what we want see uh we don't want to as
[1:24:08] they saying goes bite off more than we
[1:24:10] could chew is that right but we want to
[1:24:12] be able to manage
[1:24:14] effectively uh you know and just like
[1:24:16] brother brought out and I'm drawing some
[1:24:19] reference from the Wednesday night
[1:24:21] service amen we're talk about that
[1:24:23] temporary
[1:24:24] Ministry um and the the the the parable
[1:24:28] of the talents was tied into that you
[1:24:31] know and if you haven't listened to that
[1:24:32] service you should go back and listen to
[1:24:34] it because drawing from that you could
[1:24:36] see that uh he gave to every man
[1:24:39] according to his several
[1:24:41] ability God knows what you can handle he
[1:24:44] he doesn't give you more than you can
[1:24:46] bear he doesn't put you in a situation
[1:24:49] that he knows you can't manage the
[1:24:52] stress of it the the the trial of of it
[1:24:54] or the testing of it amen but he's
[1:24:58] growing you little by little so he give
[1:24:59] you just enough to build your muscles so
[1:25:03] that you could be ready for the next
[1:25:04] fight because the muscles you gain here
[1:25:07] is what you are going to need when you
[1:25:09] get
[1:25:11] there isn't that right and what you get
[1:25:15] there is going to take you there and so
[1:25:16] forth isn't that right Jesus learned
[1:25:19] obedience by the things he suffered and
[1:25:21] it took full obedience to go on the
[1:25:24] cross
[1:25:25] and die for us isn't that right the the
[1:25:27] testing was relevant to to the final
[1:25:30] outcome uh to what was needed and the
[1:25:33] final hour uh it wasn't just a relevant
[1:25:36] test or a spot quiz uh God is not random
[1:25:40] uh when he gives you a test he's
[1:25:42] preparing you for something that's
[1:25:44] coming up the road that's why this bride
[1:25:47] has to be tested on brotherly kindness
[1:25:50] Spirit of forgiveness Hallelujah we have
[1:25:52] to possess that and we have to maintain
[1:25:55] it because that Hallelujah that sweet
[1:25:58] Spirit praise God is what charity is
[1:26:00] going to come down on and we have to
[1:26:03] catch that stone hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:07] and God's going to raise up a people in
[1:26:08] the land who under their Messenger will
[1:26:12] be the final voice to the final age who
[1:26:15] will finally strike Revelation
[1:26:19] 2217 let the spirit and the bride say
[1:26:22] come how you going to come if you don't
[1:26:26] strike brotherly kindness if you don't
[1:26:28] find that lost
[1:26:30] coin how you going to strike it hallu
[1:26:34] you got to have place in Christ got to
[1:26:37] have holy decency am got to have
[1:26:40] Brotherly Love in there then you can
[1:26:42] call to the other members come and
[1:26:45] rejoice with us because we found
[1:26:48] something we have recovered something
[1:26:51] that was once lost isn't that right oh
[1:26:54] wonderful now we at Luke 15 amen praise
[1:26:56] God God is leading well talking about
[1:26:59] the woman of the Lost coin we're already
[1:27:00] there either what woman brother uh Jesus
[1:27:04] said in the scripture what woman having
[1:27:06] 10 pieces of silver if she lose one
[1:27:09] piece do not light a candle and sweep
[1:27:12] the house and and seek
[1:27:15] diligently until she find it and when
[1:27:18] she had found it she cth her friends and
[1:27:21] her neighbors together saying come re
[1:27:24] Rejoice with me for I have found the
[1:27:27] peace which was lost isn't that right
[1:27:30] and this is an interesting story that
[1:27:32] the Lord gives because here's a
[1:27:34] situation with a woman who has this as
[1:27:37] the prophet described it a sacred
[1:27:39] headdress or sacred headpiece with which
[1:27:43] there are 10 tablets or pieces or coins
[1:27:47] in them that represent her virtues uh
[1:27:50] her marital vows and so forth like that
[1:27:52] are embedded within the address and and
[1:27:55] it's interesting because she if this was
[1:27:58] so valuable she was supposed to guard
[1:28:02] this thing uh she was supposed to keep
[1:28:04] this possession safe she was supposed to
[1:28:07] keep this in a safe place but I guess
[1:28:10] through the course of time sometimes we
[1:28:12] lose things sometimes we lose our keys
[1:28:14] or we misplace our watch or we misplace
[1:28:17] our glasses but but this was a thing of
[1:28:19] great possession this ought to have been
[1:28:22] kept with a certain level of diligence
[1:28:25] but somehow along the way she was not
[1:28:27] diligent about this possession and only
[1:28:30] to realize that a coin was
[1:28:32] missing and her husband was returning
[1:28:36] now her husband wasn't the one
[1:28:37] responsible for moving the coins that's
[1:28:39] right a higher up in her community could
[1:28:42] have done it a priest or someone who
[1:28:45] found her in in a in a in a compromised
[1:28:48] position uh could have removed the coin
[1:28:50] she how is she going to explain how this
[1:28:53] coin has been lost uh she would end up
[1:28:56] in a predicament and it is because she
[1:28:59] was not diligent in keeping her
[1:29:01] possession in a safe place she misplaced
[1:29:04] it somehow but she had to go find it
[1:29:08] what woman having 10 piece of Sila if
[1:29:10] she lose one that she do light a candle
[1:29:13] so this morning if you have lost
[1:29:15] something or if you lost your joy you
[1:29:17] you lost your peace you lost that sweet
[1:29:20] Breeze of the spirit oh you have to find
[1:29:23] it this morning
[1:29:24] you have to be
[1:29:26] diligent about the
[1:29:28] possessions about the things that God
[1:29:30] have give you if you had a victory at
[1:29:33] the altar if God pour out his Spirit
[1:29:36] upon you you have to fight to keep that
[1:29:40] the fight is not over when you walk away
[1:29:42] from the altar no no no the fight is
[1:29:44] only just begun because Monday morning
[1:29:47] is coming work is coming bills is coming
[1:29:52] the cares of life is coming to try to
[1:29:55] choke that seed you've got to maintain
[1:29:58] your borders this morning and keep on
[1:30:00] praising him keep on worshiping him keep
[1:30:03] on creating an atmosphere around you in
[1:30:07] your home in your life stay with the
[1:30:10] word read the word pray every day oh
[1:30:14] Hallelujah and maintain your
[1:30:18] blessing until the next
[1:30:21] battle that's what we do amen hallelujah
[1:30:24] oh my so it's an interesting story and I
[1:30:26] found that there's a there's a element
[1:30:28] of of of a failure here and brother
[1:30:30] brandham says that uh you know the
[1:30:32] church is loling you know uh they're
[1:30:35] gazing around they they they they
[1:30:37] haven't they not lost their focus heing
[1:30:40] unto them teachers and so forth like
[1:30:41] that when we ought to be growing and
[1:30:44] getting stronger we ought to be way up
[1:30:46] the road by now with all that has been
[1:30:49] revealed to us uh because to whom much
[1:30:52] is given much is expected and when the
[1:30:55] son of man cometh shall he find faith on
[1:30:59] the earth amen isn't that right we have
[1:31:02] to be able to answer that call when the
[1:31:04] son of man comes and say yes I have
[1:31:07] faith isn't that right seven tunders
[1:31:09] give faith for Rapture in Grace isn't
[1:31:11] that right amen you see so something she
[1:31:15] failed to do right now she had to use so
[1:31:17] maintenance is like the consistency part
[1:31:20] of your life you know there are moments
[1:31:23] of intensity but then there are moments
[1:31:26] of consistency where you have to keep
[1:31:28] doing the right thing every day in order
[1:31:31] to progress you don't want to wait for
[1:31:34] intensity this woman who lost her piece
[1:31:36] of silver she had to use intensity to
[1:31:39] get back what she lost it was an urgent
[1:31:42] matter it was the house on fire kind of
[1:31:44] situation she had to get into into
[1:31:47] adrenaline mode to recover herself to
[1:31:51] recover what was lost before the evening
[1:31:54] Shadows Fall there are moments like that
[1:31:57] in life but if we maintain what we have
[1:32:00] there'll be less moments of intensity
[1:32:02] for us we could actually uh H come into
[1:32:05] our own and begin to get used to being
[1:32:08] in that presence with God for God
[1:32:11] Walking with God until it becomes second
[1:32:13] nature to us until it's not strange for
[1:32:16] us to say let me talk it over with Jesus
[1:32:19] before I make this situation before I
[1:32:22] make this Choice let me just come aside
[1:32:24] for 2 minutes I want to do something but
[1:32:26] I don't want to do it without him I want
[1:32:29] to know that he's with me Lord I'm about
[1:32:32] to buy this I'm about to do that Lord
[1:32:35] just for two minutes I want to ask you a
[1:32:37] question just like David he would
[1:32:39] inquire of the Lord uh Lord is it okay
[1:32:42] to pursue or should I hold a fort should
[1:32:46] I stay here or should I go what should I
[1:32:49] do the prophet said that bride when she
[1:32:52] gets to that place she will have thus
[1:32:54] sayth the Lord or keep still which means
[1:32:58] you come into a position oh somebody
[1:33:00] help me you come into a lifestyle of
[1:33:04] Holiness where you are walking with God
[1:33:07] so much until you don't feel comfortable
[1:33:11] making a choice unless he is with you in
[1:33:14] the trial in the Tempest in the storm he
[1:33:19] is with you he said I'll never leave you
[1:33:22] I'll never forsake you it's got to
[1:33:26] become a
[1:33:29] practicing of the presence of
[1:33:32] God every
[1:33:34] day just the other day before Christmas
[1:33:36] I was going to do something and I said
[1:33:38] Lord I just I'm going to do this thing I
[1:33:40] just want to know if it's all right
[1:33:42] Hallelujah just want to know if it's all
[1:33:44] right I come away from the from the
[1:33:46] cashier from where I was I said Lord
[1:33:48] help me to know that this is the
[1:33:50] decision you want me to make and I feel
[1:33:52] it's so important with do that CU a lot
[1:33:55] of times we feel so confident in maybe
[1:33:57] our ability or the things that we have
[1:33:59] that we lose sight of the fact that we
[1:34:01] belong to
[1:34:03] God we have to give an account to God we
[1:34:06] ought to take inventory at times um when
[1:34:10] we are making a decision sometimes you
[1:34:12] might call your wife or call your
[1:34:13] husband but make sure and call God too
[1:34:17] make sure you have enough credit on your
[1:34:19] phone to give your father a call uh
[1:34:23] before before you take the next step cuz
[1:34:26] the next step could be it could be here
[1:34:29] or there in this life is like that you
[1:34:33] know just the other day I had skin
[1:34:34] rashes all over my skin I didn't look
[1:34:36] like what I did a week ago I said look
[1:34:39] how unpredictable life is one moment
[1:34:41] you're in this state and then it could
[1:34:44] all change just like that you have to
[1:34:47] walk with God you've got to know that
[1:34:49] he's with you and he's helping you make
[1:34:51] these
[1:34:52] decisions cuz it could be your last
[1:34:55] right you don't know see so you just
[1:34:57] want to be know that he's he's there
[1:34:59] amen okay so in that same luke5 it talks
[1:35:02] about the woman of lost coin he also
[1:35:03] talks about a prodigal son he said a
[1:35:06] certain man had two sons the younger of
[1:35:07] them said to his father father give me a
[1:35:09] portion of the goods that fth to me and
[1:35:12] he divided it unto them his living the
[1:35:15] Bible distinguishes this son as the
[1:35:17] younger of the two the younger son said
[1:35:20] to him give me the portion that fall to
[1:35:23] me give me my
[1:35:24] inheritance I want what is mine and I
[1:35:27] think it's interesting that he
[1:35:28] distinguished the younger son because
[1:35:31] this youth usually tends to uh lean
[1:35:34] towards the idea that he is not
[1:35:37] experienced enough that he hasn't seen
[1:35:40] enough of life yet that he hasn't
[1:35:42] learned enough um of how to maintain
[1:35:46] certain things of how to get from
[1:35:48] strength to strength how to grow his
[1:35:51] assets or whatever it is he was the
[1:35:54] younger of the two sons so he didn't
[1:35:56] really have all that he didn't go to all
[1:35:58] of the school classes uh he hadn't yet
[1:36:01] reached form five he's still coming up
[1:36:04] there but yet he feels somehow in his
[1:36:06] mind that he was independent enough to
[1:36:09] say I want my inheritance no now I heard
[1:36:13] a preacher say one time that if you
[1:36:15] think you're independent and you have to
[1:36:17] ask your daddy for power to leave home
[1:36:22] then you're really not that
[1:36:24] independent uh because you needed your
[1:36:26] father's permission um to leave the
[1:36:29] house so you have to wonder what kind of
[1:36:31] Independence we talking about here um
[1:36:34] because when you're really independent
[1:36:36] you could you could make your own M
[1:36:38] choices you can move out when you want
[1:36:41] you have things to move with uh but he
[1:36:43] didn't have anything he he was moving
[1:36:45] with what his father gave him so it just
[1:36:49] shows the the the the sense of maturity
[1:36:51] here in this you see
[1:36:54] and so he asked for all of his
[1:36:55] inheritance and and and um okay let me
[1:36:58] skip on down here amen oh they love him
[1:37:02] this
[1:37:02] morning so not many days after the
[1:37:04] youngest son gathered all together took
[1:37:06] his journey into a far country as what
[1:37:08] the Bible says right in verse 13 Luke 15
[1:37:12] and um and there wasted his substance
[1:37:14] with riotous living here it is that he
[1:37:17] got his possession but he ended up
[1:37:20] wasting it away because the principle of
[1:37:23] keep keeping the blessing maintaining it
[1:37:26] was not part of his plan of
[1:37:29] operation so he just wasted it away see
[1:37:32] he spent all that he had is so
[1:37:34] unfortunate he went off into a far
[1:37:37] country which means anywhere that the
[1:37:39] father was not that is where he was
[1:37:42] pitching his
[1:37:43] tent some people because they want to do
[1:37:46] their thing they pitch their tent up far
[1:37:49] away from the father far away from the
[1:37:52] word far away from the presence of God
[1:37:55] as possible because they clearly their
[1:37:58] intention is to is to do what they want
[1:38:00] you see um uh once you get but you see
[1:38:04] uh once you get far enough now you're on
[1:38:06] your own you see you become vulnerable
[1:38:09] become open to the attack isn't that
[1:38:10] right and as life would have it the
[1:38:13] Bible said there was a famine in the
[1:38:15] land and the son uh saw the power of
[1:38:19] money The Treasure of The Inheritance
[1:38:21] would give him he saw the power in that
[1:38:23] but what he didn't see was the famine
[1:38:25] coming that's right to waste down what
[1:38:28] he thought was so great to possess uh
[1:38:31] there was famine coming so sometimes you
[1:38:34] have a possession uh but the test is
[1:38:36] coming the trial is coming and it takes
[1:38:39] a wisdom of God to put things in place
[1:38:42] so that when the famine comes when the
[1:38:45] storm comes or the floods of Life come
[1:38:48] to waste to hit to attack at your
[1:38:50] possession you've got something to hold
[1:38:53] rains you have to have some investment
[1:38:57] some return on your investment to keep
[1:38:59] the thing moving forward or at some
[1:39:02] point you come to a dead stop you come
[1:39:04] to a halt isn't that right amen so as
[1:39:08] life would have it a famine came and it
[1:39:09] wasted down his his his substance see
[1:39:12] and see he didn't see what the effect of
[1:39:13] that would have on the substance and
[1:39:15] that he didn't make wise Investments and
[1:39:17] the famine cut off all his income
[1:39:19] streams leaving him with nothing with
[1:39:21] which to reinvest and the young man came
[1:39:24] to himself this is the Glorious part of
[1:39:26] the scripture and we thank God for this
[1:39:28] amen that sometimes we make
[1:39:31] mistakes sometimes we go off to a far
[1:39:33] place in our minds and tell ourselves we
[1:39:36] can do it and we go off in the might of
[1:39:38] our own power we need to realize that we
[1:39:42] are leading ourselves and when we lead
[1:39:44] ourselves things usually go Haywire
[1:39:48] things usually go wrong the prophet
[1:39:51] thought he could lead himself when was
[1:39:53] lost in the forest and said I'm a
[1:39:55] Tracker I'm a ranger I know the the ins
[1:39:58] and outs I'm familiar with the trees I
[1:40:00] know how to get around yet all the while
[1:40:03] he was trying to lead himself and kept
[1:40:06] going around in circles and it is only
[1:40:08] when he stop and realize his condition
[1:40:12] that's when God was able to touch him on
[1:40:14] the shoulder and let him know that you
[1:40:17] might not be as good as you think you
[1:40:19] are you don't have all the answers you
[1:40:21] think you have and you need a savior you
[1:40:25] need a guide and we all need a guide
[1:40:29] this morning because no one man or woman
[1:40:32] has all the answers to life but in this
[1:40:35] Bible has every answer to every question
[1:40:39] that you will ever face in this world or
[1:40:41] world to come hallelujah
[1:40:44] hallelujah oh glory to God so we ought
[1:40:48] to acknowledge our wrong thank you Lord
[1:40:50] acknowledge the fact that we we can't do
[1:40:53] it on our own and yield to God and he
[1:40:56] brings the circumstances one on top the
[1:40:59] other Until It Breaks you until you
[1:41:03] realize that you need
[1:41:05] Jesus he's going to continue to push you
[1:41:08] into a corner until you realize you have
[1:41:11] to surrender it is just too much for you
[1:41:15] when the children of Israel began to cry
[1:41:18] out unto the Lord their task Masters had
[1:41:20] increased increase increase increase the
[1:41:23] weapons and God let it go on because
[1:41:26] what he's waiting for is a
[1:41:29] cry fact of the matter is you haven't
[1:41:31] seen your deliverance yet because you
[1:41:33] ain't cried enough yet God wants his
[1:41:36] believing children to cry out unto him
[1:41:40] and when he hears the cries of his
[1:41:43] people then he's compelled to do
[1:41:45] something about your situation and until
[1:41:49] you allow your Foolish Pride to be cast
[1:41:52] down
[1:41:53] to be ripped down then and only then
[1:41:57] will you hear from God God wants to tear
[1:42:00] you
[1:42:01] up God wants to rip it
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:06] down some of us are too intact some of
[1:42:09] us are too whole some of us are too
[1:42:11] Hallelujah polished up we need to be
[1:42:14] broken like porcelain on the
[1:42:17] ground Hallelujah because he alone knows
[1:42:21] where every piece is and he could put
[1:42:24] you back together
[1:42:26] [Applause]
[1:42:28] again
[1:42:30] hallelujah
[1:42:32] amen and so you got to come to yourself
[1:42:36] at some point this young man did that he
[1:42:38] came to himself amen what a glorious
[1:42:41] hope the scripture gives he came to
[1:42:43] himself and began to talk to himself he
[1:42:45] began to talk to himself ask himself
[1:42:46] questions does my father's house have
[1:42:49] meat in it doesn't it have the fatted
[1:42:51] calf doesn't it have uh carpet a couch
[1:42:54] to sit on I'm sitting on a log near a
[1:42:57] pig pen eating corn husk I mean come
[1:43:02] on this is not what I'm meant
[1:43:06] for this is not what I'm accustomed to
[1:43:09] this is not what I know to be true I'm
[1:43:12] only accepting this reality because I'm
[1:43:14] too proud to admit that I'm not very
[1:43:17] good at doing this life thing and I need
[1:43:20] help in this department I need help in
[1:43:23] this Arena I'm getting licks I'm on the
[1:43:27] ropes I'm dying and I need assistance
[1:43:31] we've got to be willing to cry out for
[1:43:33] hell just like Peter come out into the
[1:43:35] boat he was following Jesus and he start
[1:43:38] to sink what' he do cried out for help
[1:43:42] the prophet said we have every right
[1:43:44] today as a Christian as a Believer if
[1:43:46] you ever found in in want if you ever
[1:43:49] found slipping you could cry out the
[1:43:52] same way that Peter did and say Lord
[1:43:55] Save Me Oh Hallelujah help me pull me up
[1:44:00] out of the situation I've got myself
[1:44:03] into and I believe he will do that for
[1:44:05] us this morning if we're willing to to
[1:44:08] to to cry out to him amen so he talked
[1:44:12] himself enough to arise and go back to
[1:44:14] his father's house and ask for
[1:44:16] forgiveness amen all right so the Lord
[1:44:17] says little by little I'll dve them out
[1:44:19] see that's our little strategy this
[1:44:20] morning we're talking about and um until
[1:44:22] th be increase and inheriting the land
[1:44:24] little by little you will possess the
[1:44:26] land to avoid wastage cuz it didn't want
[1:44:30] to overwhelm you right so you possess
[1:44:32] some you keep it paint the walls clean
[1:44:35] the shutters right cut the yard right
[1:44:37] now that that is in a good condition now
[1:44:39] you're in the rhythm of things we can
[1:44:41] now look to see what else is next for
[1:44:43] you uh and how to enlarge or increase
[1:44:46] your territory um and to come into what
[1:44:49] God has for you in the in the outcome
[1:44:51] isn't that right oh my and you will come
[1:44:54] into your own as you increase
[1:44:56] incrementally until you're able to
[1:44:57] effectively manage and maintain the land
[1:45:00] of possessions so we're talking about
[1:45:01] the pyramid right and we go up stage by
[1:45:04] stage you can't stay where we are we
[1:45:07] have to go on and possess possess and
[1:45:10] maintain and in the maintenance is
[1:45:12] testings is Trials because the devil
[1:45:15] will make you prove every inch of ground
[1:45:18] you claim to stand upon isn't that right
[1:45:21] so that's what the maintenance is for to
[1:45:23] make sure that you could prove that
[1:45:25] you're worthy of the possession that you
[1:45:27] got so if you got knowledge God's going
[1:45:29] to test you on knowledge to see if you
[1:45:32] really going to keep it or if you're
[1:45:34] going to give it away isn't that right
[1:45:37] but once you could keep it hold on to it
[1:45:40] then you're ready for temperance and if
[1:45:42] you can keep that then you're ready for
[1:45:44] patience and if you can maintain that
[1:45:47] then you're ready for godliness you're
[1:45:48] ready for brotherly
[1:45:50] kindness and that's how we grow
[1:45:53] and that's how we we mature isn't that
[1:45:56] right oh my that's what we want amenu so
[1:46:00] God gave them strategies to possess the
[1:46:02] land in the Book of Joshua right um for
[1:46:05] inheritance to divide it among the
[1:46:06] children of Israel to give each one
[1:46:08] their portion in order to maintain and
[1:46:10] to divide it among themselves to have
[1:46:13] their own yard and grass and that kind
[1:46:15] of thing you know wonderful and I love
[1:46:18] it because it's different strategies the
[1:46:20] way they conquered the aites was not the
[1:46:22] same way that they had to conquer the
[1:46:24] jebusites the way that they conquered
[1:46:25] the jebusites was not the same way that
[1:46:27] they conquered the parasites or or the
[1:46:30] amorites or the Hittites or the median
[1:46:32] ites it wasn't the same it was always a
[1:46:34] different strategy connected to it
[1:46:36] because it's a different thing you're
[1:46:37] going to possess it's on a higher level
[1:46:40] it requires more muscles it requires
[1:46:43] sharper tools better weapons requires
[1:46:46] Precision accuracy learn to control your
[1:46:49] breathing run through the troop stay the
[1:46:53] course how many horses we need how many
[1:46:55] men we need how to use resources oh
[1:46:58] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[1:47:02] right it's all strategy and there's a
[1:47:06] wisdom in the thing you know it's not
[1:47:08] just called wildly pelting stones and
[1:47:10] sticks God is not a wild man he's a
[1:47:13] gentleman he knocks on the door he he
[1:47:16] has a way an approach there's a thing
[1:47:18] he's trying to do an intent yes to every
[1:47:21] purpose he has you are God's purpose he
[1:47:24] had an intent for you what intent for
[1:47:27] you he has not for somebody else he give
[1:47:29] every man to each his own ability you've
[1:47:32] got abilities inside you this morning
[1:47:35] and God knows just how to get it out of
[1:47:37] you so he's going to pass you through a
[1:47:40] specific road so that you can be shaped
[1:47:43] a certain way cut a certain way honed a
[1:47:47] certain way to serve a certain position
[1:47:50] because you've got to fit in that
[1:47:52] pyramid that's right the way he wants
[1:47:54] you to fit so that the whole body could
[1:47:57] be joint packed together Hallelujah each
[1:48:00] joint
[1:48:01] supplying according to the effectual
[1:48:04] part of the whole body of the thing he
[1:48:07] knows he knows it we don't know that's
[1:48:10] why we have to
[1:48:11] surrender um to the Master Mason who is
[1:48:14] doing the shaping who is doing the
[1:48:17] cutting and making sure that we get to
[1:48:19] the destination isn't that right oh my
[1:48:22] so it's different strategies right each
[1:48:24] strategy is different because each enemy
[1:48:26] was different Jes and they required a
[1:48:28] different strategy in order to defeat
[1:48:30] them and possess he that is faithful in
[1:48:32] little be faithful in much the Bible
[1:48:34] also says he that is unjust in the least
[1:48:36] will also be unjust in much so the
[1:48:38] reverse is also true if you're faithful
[1:48:41] in little faithful in much if you're
[1:48:42] unjust in in little you be unjust in
[1:48:44] much which means here's the summary the
[1:48:48] lesson is in the
[1:48:50] little that's where the lesson is yes
[1:48:54] the lesson is actually in the little you
[1:48:56] could be faithful in little you could be
[1:48:57] unjust in little the rule will apply the
[1:49:00] same when you scale it up but the
[1:49:02] foundation bottom of it is in the little
[1:49:05] that you start off with isn't that right
[1:49:08] because if you could conquer when times
[1:49:10] are rough then surely you could prosper
[1:49:13] in times are plenty by applying the same
[1:49:17] principles but at a much larger scale
[1:49:20] you could actually scale up your
[1:49:21] principles that you learned in the rough
[1:49:23] time that's right to learn how to manage
[1:49:25] the better times when things is nice
[1:49:28] when the goose is hanging High uh you
[1:49:30] could you could handle that because you
[1:49:32] know how to to to run the the the the
[1:49:35] rugged sand training sometimes when they
[1:49:38] training thorough breed horses they run
[1:49:39] them through sand there's a lot of
[1:49:41] restriction on that kind of terrain but
[1:49:44] it builds their muscle form so when they
[1:49:47] come on a clean clear truck it's
[1:49:50] lightning speed because them tellers are
[1:49:53] used to the Restriction the restraint
[1:49:56] Hallelujah having to push through sand
[1:49:59] and difficult mud and terrain so when
[1:50:02] they get to the real racetrack it's all
[1:50:05] guns firing because they've been trained
[1:50:08] a certain way and their muscles are used
[1:50:11] to uh having to push past uh certain
[1:50:15] trials and testings and and rough
[1:50:17] terrain that's why God passes us through
[1:50:20] rough terrain oh little by little we
[1:50:23] learn and we get stronger little by
[1:50:25] little we learn how to overcome this
[1:50:27] trial overcome this test how to step
[1:50:30] over the dead bodies as it were and keep
[1:50:33] on moving forward 10,000 fall on my
[1:50:36] right side a thousand on my left but it
[1:50:38] shall not come n thee for Only With
[1:50:41] Thine Eyes th Shall Behold and see the
[1:50:43] reward of the wicked because thou has
[1:50:45] made the Lord thy
[1:50:48] habitation amen and amen apart from
[1:50:51] maintaining a possession
[1:50:53] you can also bring us out Point real
[1:50:54] quick we're running out of time uh but I
[1:50:56] thank you so much this
[1:50:58] morning um amen for your uh uh your
[1:51:02] Praises apart from maintaining a
[1:51:04] possession you could also maintain a
[1:51:05] position right let's bring this up real
[1:51:07] quick Jesus said um uh Jesus Christ same
[1:51:10] yesterday and today and forever sorry uh
[1:51:13] brother brandham says here on Jesus
[1:51:14] Christ same yesterday today and forever
[1:51:16] he said and firmly being a
[1:51:17] fundamentalist who believes God's
[1:51:19] Eternal Word believing that everything
[1:51:21] that God has written is part of himself
[1:51:22] self he said I believe the scripture
[1:51:24] says in the beginning was the word the
[1:51:26] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:51:28] so therefore the word is part of God so
[1:51:31] he's differentiating this here now the
[1:51:32] word and God is the same the word is
[1:51:34] part of God if we will approach it like
[1:51:37] that approach his word like we are
[1:51:39] actually approaching him the person
[1:51:41] right for no man is any better than his
[1:51:44] word is see a man and his word is the
[1:51:46] same so if you couldn't take your if I
[1:51:48] couldn't take your word I wouldn't
[1:51:50] believe you for anything same you should
[1:51:53] by me and Prophet said that's the way I
[1:51:55] would do it by God if God made a promise
[1:51:59] and if he is almighty God he must stay
[1:52:02] by his promise in order to maintain his
[1:52:06] position as almighty
[1:52:08] God so by so by keeping his promise is
[1:52:13] how God maintains his position as Lord
[1:52:17] God if he said something he will keep it
[1:52:21] that's how he Main maintains his
[1:52:23] position if we promise to deliver you he
[1:52:25] will deliver you that's how he maintains
[1:52:28] his position he will always be gone
[1:52:31] because he has the ability to keep his
[1:52:33] own word to maintain what he has said
[1:52:37] and to keep and watch over his word to
[1:52:40] make sure it fulfilled and to perform it
[1:52:43] in its due time isn't that right he
[1:52:46] cannot make a promise and then take it
[1:52:48] back I can make a promise and have it
[1:52:50] take back the prophet said you will make
[1:52:52] a promise promise and have to take it
[1:52:53] back because we are men and we're finite
[1:52:57] but he is infinite God cannot get wiser
[1:53:01] smarter he was perfect to begin with and
[1:53:04] when God makes a statement it is perfect
[1:53:08] isn't that right so God has a position
[1:53:10] that he has to maintain and his position
[1:53:13] as God being God by keeping his word
[1:53:17] keeping his promises isn't that right
[1:53:19] and we have a position to maintain also
[1:53:21] this morning isn't that right as Sons
[1:53:24] and Daughters of God to possess and to
[1:53:26] maintain our position as Sons and
[1:53:29] Daughters of God isn't that right we
[1:53:32] have something to do too as well isn't
[1:53:33] that right we have to pray we have to
[1:53:36] call on God we have to get out the
[1:53:38] strange Idols we have to clean up our
[1:53:40] lives we have to light a candle we have
[1:53:43] to sweep
[1:53:44] diligently we have to do what we have to
[1:53:47] do isn't that right in order to maintain
[1:53:49] our position as Sons and Daughters of
[1:53:52] God God when we come into this building
[1:53:54] to worship we are maintaining our
[1:53:56] position when we come and we shout and
[1:53:58] we lift our hands we are letting the
[1:54:00] devil know I'm maintaining my position
[1:54:03] in the house of God as a Son of God as a
[1:54:06] daughter of God I'm here to praise him
[1:54:09] I'm here to lift my hands I'm here to
[1:54:11] let the devil know that despite the
[1:54:13] trial despite the test I'm maintain in
[1:54:16] my stand having done all to stand stand
[1:54:21] therefore and maintain your position
[1:54:24] this morning oh until he come maintain
[1:54:28] the fight
[1:54:30] Amen to maintain actually means to fight
[1:54:33] to earnestly contend for it in order to
[1:54:36] maintain or keep it in other words you
[1:54:38] had to fight to get it and now you have
[1:54:41] to fight to keep it isn't that right
[1:54:44] it's a fight all the way it's just a
[1:54:46] different kind of fight the first fight
[1:54:49] was intense possess you get it Capture
[1:54:51] the Flag cut away the enemy but in the
[1:54:53] Second Battle it's an endurance battle
[1:54:56] it's in the ins and the outs it's in
[1:54:58] replenishing the consumables it's in
[1:55:00] making sure that things are working
[1:55:02] things are functioning and then every
[1:55:04] day you're doing a little that that goes
[1:55:07] that adds up to a lot amen and you're
[1:55:09] cutting down some to add increase to
[1:55:12] your border and
[1:55:13] territory what God has for you little by
[1:55:17] little amen oh my so uh so see so they
[1:55:22] are fighting to possess the land and
[1:55:24] they believe that is their own isn't
[1:55:25] that right and all war this morning is a
[1:55:27] Holy Ghost Land of promises that we are
[1:55:30] trying to occupy it's a holy war of
[1:55:33] occupation and the contract is in The
[1:55:35] Souls of our feet that's where the
[1:55:37] contract is at isn't that right wherever
[1:55:39] The Souls of feet shall tread upon that
[1:55:41] have I given unto you the Bible says
[1:55:44] according to Joshua 1 and if God be with
[1:55:46] us this morning then we are more than
[1:55:48] able to possess the land that God had
[1:55:51] given us us and divide the land for an
[1:55:54] inheritance and to maintain our
[1:55:57] possession but abam speaks here he says
[1:55:59] so many says of the Lord will take this
[1:56:01] evil spirit from me from drinking from
[1:56:03] gambling or from lying or stealing I'll
[1:56:06] serve him but he said that's up to you
[1:56:08] see you've got to do something too they
[1:56:12] that overcome shall inherit all things
[1:56:15] they that overcome you shall have power
[1:56:17] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[1:56:20] it down see she made herself ready I
[1:56:24] like that word he said you see God
[1:56:26] couldn't push us through a little pipe
[1:56:28] pull us out on the other end and then
[1:56:30] say blessed is he that overcome it you
[1:56:33] had nothing to overcome he just pushed
[1:56:35] you through but you've got to make
[1:56:38] decisions for yourself God give you that
[1:56:41] to do you've got to choose and you've
[1:56:44] got to be willing to lay it down say
[1:56:46] Lord help me make the right choice I I
[1:56:48] want to know your will isn't that right
[1:56:50] see I have to make decision for myself
[1:56:52] the prophet said and in doing that we
[1:56:54] show our faith and respects to God
[1:56:58] Abraham was a promised child uh was
[1:57:00] promised a child sorry Abraham was
[1:57:02] promised a child but he must maintain
[1:57:04] the promise for 25 years Prophet said
[1:57:07] the ups and downs that he had the
[1:57:08] Temptations and in those 25 years but he
[1:57:11] held to the Word of Promise isn't that
[1:57:15] right oh my praise God hallelujah do you
[1:57:19] love him today
[1:57:20] amen's get trouble
[1:57:23] amen Oh Glory to
[1:57:31] God all
[1:57:39] right amen they love him this morning
[1:57:43] praise God just give him some praises
[1:58:18] amen okay wonderful see Israel has
[1:58:21] promised a Promised Land but they had to
[1:58:22] fight for every inch of it uh whatever
[1:58:25] The Souls of your foot shall tread upon
[1:58:26] that have I given unto you said Joshua
[1:58:28] and it was all there see the land was
[1:58:31] there God give it to them but they must
[1:58:34] fight for it isn't that right okay I'm
[1:58:35] winding down now musician can get ready
[1:58:37] to come the same way it is about Divine
[1:58:39] Healing God has got the power to heal
[1:58:41] you but is if you got the courage to
[1:58:44] accept it but you'll have to fight every
[1:58:47] inch of the way God has got Amazing
[1:58:50] Grace to save you and he will do it but
[1:58:53] you have to fight every inch of your way
[1:58:56] he said I've been behind the pulpit
[1:58:57] going on 31 years and every inch of that
[1:59:00] has been a fight constantly it certainly
[1:59:02] was but we must fight he said if we must
[1:59:06] reain and so we find out that the bride
[1:59:08] has to make herself ready you've got to
[1:59:12] make yourself ready because your
[1:59:14] bridegroom is coming and you've got to
[1:59:16] have your wedding garment on this
[1:59:18] morning isn't that right we've got to
[1:59:20] make ourselves ready we willing to lay
[1:59:22] aside every weight that does so easily
[1:59:24] beset us that we might run with patience
[1:59:27] the race that's set before us that we
[1:59:30] must lay them aside ourselves and we
[1:59:32] can't say God you come and lay them
[1:59:34] aside for us we've got to do that
[1:59:38] ourselves he said and now I want to see
[1:59:40] this place before audience and so forth
[1:59:42] God is still the same as he ever on he
[1:59:43] Remains the Same isn't that right he
[1:59:45] said he's always the same it's the
[1:59:47] people that get away from God but not
[1:59:49] God from the people he said they lose
[1:59:51] their faith F but God covers all space
[1:59:54] everywhere he's omnipresent you see and
[1:59:57] he's always be will be everywhere he
[1:59:59] said but it's the attitude of the people
[2:00:02] that brings the results and that's the
[2:00:04] reason at Pentecost that they had to go
[2:00:07] into an upper room and pray until the
[2:00:09] Holy Ghost come they got in one place
[2:00:13] and in one Accord it's the atmosphere
[2:00:16] what brings the results he said you
[2:00:18] believe that let every man and woman in
[2:00:21] this building this morning boy or girl
[2:00:24] get everything from their minds but the
[2:00:26] Lord Jesus and believe that he's
[2:00:27] standing present right now and you'll
[2:00:30] see something happening that'll cause
[2:00:31] headlines in the newspaper in the
[2:00:33] morning that's right he said it's the
[2:00:36] atmosphere he said Divine Healing
[2:00:38] sanctification and the powers of God is
[2:00:41] as long as your faith lasts in it here's
[2:00:44] a part we get to and we Christi do as
[2:00:47] long as your faith lasts in it so you've
[2:00:49] got to maintain your faith God give you
[2:00:51] a healing God give you a Deliverance God
[2:00:53] give you a victory it lasts as long as
[2:00:56] your faith lasts in it he said and when
[2:00:59] your faith fails then your experience is
[2:01:02] gone oh no wonder God told Peter I pray
[2:01:05] for you why that your faith fail not so
[2:01:09] that your faith could remain in the
[2:01:11] Blessed holy word isn't that right and
[2:01:14] upkeep your deliverance and maintain
[2:01:16] your position I pray that your faith
[2:01:19] fail not isn't that right oh my then
[2:01:21] your experience is gone see if your
[2:01:22] faith fails it's based that way simply
[2:01:24] upon the finished works of Christ at
[2:01:26] Calvary he said you're Sanctified as
[2:01:28] long as your testimony is right as long
[2:01:30] as you live a Sanctified life and
[2:01:32] believe that God Sanctified you you're
[2:01:34] Sanctified counting it all to his grace
[2:01:35] and his merits as long as you've
[2:01:37] accepted your healing believe your
[2:01:39] healing you go on believing like that
[2:01:40] you'll be as healed as long as you
[2:01:43] believe it isn't that right Hallelujah
[2:01:45] glory to God amen amen amen I'm almost
[2:01:49] finished you can begin to play something
[2:01:51] Softly amen he says here now God wants
[2:01:53] to bless us in order to do that he has
[2:01:55] to train Us in Little Things isn't that
[2:01:57] right this man said if your they believe
[2:02:00] you to be a prophet why don't you teach
[2:02:01] them how to receive spiritual gifts and
[2:02:03] how to do things for God why don't you
[2:02:05] teach them things like that if you're a
[2:02:07] prophet the prophet said how can I teach
[2:02:10] them algebra when they won't even learn
[2:02:12] their ABCs he said you know what ABC
[2:02:15] means always believe Christ uh-huh how
[2:02:18] you going to do that see you you want to
[2:02:20] get way up there
[2:02:22] instead of starting down here he said
[2:02:25] God will build his church upon the
[2:02:27] foundation of Jesus Christ and that's
[2:02:30] the Bible outside of that all other
[2:02:33] grounds is sinking Sands God doesn't
[2:02:36] change and his nature doesn't change
[2:02:40] isn't that right amen amen amen first
[2:02:44] Peter one says the trial of your faith
[2:02:47] being much more precious than gold and
[2:02:50] that perisheth though it be tried with
[2:02:53] fire might be found unto the praise and
[2:02:56] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[2:03:00] Jesus Christ isn't that right so the
[2:03:02] lesson is in a little this morning God
[2:03:05] will test you as brother spoke about uh
[2:03:08] that Wednesday night with a temporary
[2:03:10] position things that he give you in a
[2:03:13] temporary way to bless you with that you
[2:03:16] have to maintain that and stay with
[2:03:19] God's word and show that you're fully
[2:03:21] prepared to hold that line when Elijah
[2:03:24] caught Elisha he was plowing at the he
[2:03:27] was at the plow the prophet said he knew
[2:03:29] how to keep a straight line and that's
[2:03:32] the kind of man God put chose to put his
[2:03:35] mantle upon to put his anointing upon
[2:03:39] because he had learned something in a
[2:03:40] little that was going to take him all
[2:03:42] the way to bethl to gilgal to the school
[2:03:45] of the prophets he knew how to kept that
[2:03:48] line and stay with God and say I want
[2:03:52] that kind of blessing isn't that right
[2:03:55] Christ did the work of a carpenter I'm
[2:03:56] finishing up amen during his years of
[2:03:58] Silence he was baptized by John in the
[2:04:00] river but 18 years of Silence he was a
[2:04:02] carpenter every day he came and opened
[2:04:04] up the shop set out the tables and
[2:04:07] chairs did his work with the best of his
[2:04:10] ability no one knew about him but he was
[2:04:12] just doing his part god training him in
[2:04:15] the little there was a mighty Ministry
[2:04:17] that he had to perform carpentry wasn't
[2:04:19] even closely related to what he had to
[2:04:21] do but he did his best with the little
[2:04:24] that God gave him until he was ready for
[2:04:28] his change of season isn't that right
[2:04:30] but AB Brandon's Ministry was a
[2:04:31] temporary Ministry isn't that right God
[2:04:32] told him youall do the work of an
[2:04:34] evangelist isn't that right he said that
[2:04:36] he said do the work of evangelist he
[2:04:37] said he didn't say you was an evangelist
[2:04:39] Prophet said but he said do the work of
[2:04:41] one and the prophet said on the sign of
[2:04:43] the end he said perhaps until the time
[2:04:45] come for something else another change
[2:04:47] of work might be something different he
[2:04:50] says I don't know isn't that right we
[2:04:53] know God made him a major prophet isn't
[2:04:55] that right he stepped into his office
[2:04:58] 1963 Angels come down from heaven to
[2:05:01] declare a new season isn't that right
[2:05:03] praise God and we are all this morning
[2:05:05] doing a temporary work until we are
[2:05:08] positionally placed according to D God's
[2:05:11] Dynamic power release which we believe
[2:05:14] will positionally place the Church of
[2:05:16] God in the last days do they believe
[2:05:18] that oh my you begin me to stand I want
