[0:00] ahead. Son stand still. His son's
[0:02] talking. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[0:05] Elijah take the mantle and strike the
[0:07] river and the Jordan open up his son's
[0:09] walking. Son's talking. Oh, glory to
[0:12] God. Red Sea have to open up because
[0:15] sun's moving. It's God's people moving.
[0:17] And it's time for that Red Sea to open
[0:19] up. It's time for your mountain to move.
[0:21] It's time for your cancer to dissolve.
[0:23] It's time for your blind eye to pop
[0:25] open. Oh, glory to God. It is time for
[0:27] the anointing to strike the church of
[0:29] the living God. We are under prophecy.
[0:31] We are walking into the vision to
[0:33] provide a vision, but we walking into
[0:35] the reality of the vision to fulfill the
[0:37] vision that was prophesied of us. Oh,
[0:39] hallelujah. Oh my power.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your testimony today will
[0:45] bring judgment. Hallelujah. Against the
[0:48] city. Our testimony of the baptism of
[0:51] the Holy Ghost
[0:52] &gt;&gt; and the power of God, a holy life. Don't
[0:57] leave that one out. Will bring judgment
[0:59] against the city. Power of prayer. Are
[1:02] you with me? Power of speech. Are you
[1:05] saying amen out there? Power for a holy
[1:08] life. That is what the Holy Ghost is to
[1:11] do. Some people say, "I can't quit
[1:13] drinking. I can't quit this." The Holy
[1:15] Ghost come to live in you to make all
[1:17] these cans get away from you. To make
[1:19] you a holy life. It will make you follow
[1:22] the instructions of the Bible every
[1:23] time. It's to make you turn your head
[1:26] from them half naked women. Amen,
[1:28] brothers. Quit lusting after them and
[1:31] church members. It's to quit making you
[1:33] smoke and drink and want to be a big
[1:36] shot. Oh, glory to God. Holy Ghost take
[1:38] all the big shot thing out of you. It
[1:40] takes that out of you. It takes that
[1:42] lust to be a big shot out of you. It
[1:45] make you quit gossiping. Make you quit
[1:47] qu playing cards. Hallelujah. make you
[1:50] quit carrying on the way you do living
[1:52] untrue to your wife.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will make you set your
[1:57] affections and things above. You say, "I
[1:59] can't do it. I can't do it." He said,
[2:01] "But the Holy Spirit come for that
[2:02] purpose." That's what it come for. To
[2:04] take it out of you. All of them old
[2:07] habits and things you're doing, the old
[2:10] backbiting, separating yourself.
[2:14] Say, "Bless God, I'm a Methodist." I
[2:15] would have nothing to do with them. Holy
[2:17] rulers. The Holy Ghost come to take that
[2:18] over to you. Hallelujah. I'm a Baptist.
[2:21] I'm a Presbyterian. I wouldn't go to
[2:23] that little old holy roller church. The
[2:25] Holy Ghost come to take all that starch
[2:27] out of you. Oh, it washes you with the
[2:29] blood. It irons you out. It come to
[2:32] straighten you up. It makes the crooked
[2:34] places straight. That is what it come to
[2:36] do. All this is what the Holy Ghost was
[2:38] sent for. Hallelujah. It's to give
[2:40] uncction to the preacher. Oh, glory to
[2:43] God. Say the preacher have no uncction.
[2:45] You notice the Holy Ghost not there.
[2:46] It's to give uncction to the preacher.
[2:49] It's to give holiness to the group. It's
[2:51] to set the church in order. It's to
[2:54] bring unity of spirit. It's to unite us
[2:57] together with power. It's to unite us
[2:59] together with love, brother love. And if
[3:01] the Holy Spirit is in you, it will lead
[3:03] you right to the word. There'll be no
[3:05] excuses. Oh my. You'll make it to the
[3:08] line every time. What's the Holy Ghost
[3:10] is to make you a citizen of the kingdom
[3:13] of God. And what does God do in his
[3:15] kingdom? It's holiness, righteousness,
[3:18] purity of thought, purity of mind, power
[3:20] and love, going to the lost, healing the
[3:22] sick, performing miracles, doing great
[3:25] things. In closing remark, brother
[3:28] Brian, then it is absolutely now to you
[3:31] people, it is absolutely essential and
[3:35] necessary and compelling and compulsory
[3:40] that you receive the Holy Ghost now. For
[3:43] if you don't, you cannot come in the
[3:46] resurrection. Now watch, God cannot
[3:50] break his laws. We know that he follow
[3:53] his laws. I want to read it again. He
[3:55] says, "Now to you people, it is
[3:58] absolutely essential and necessary. It
[4:02] might be essential you shake the pastor
[4:04] hand. It might be necessary. You have to
[4:06] believe all the teachings and and all
[4:08] them. You know that might be the thing.
[4:10] But this year it is essential,
[4:13] necessary,
[4:15] compelling,
[4:17] compulsory that you receive the Holy
[4:20] Ghost now. For if you don't, you can't
[4:23] come in the resurrection. Now watch, God
[4:25] cannot bring his laws. We know that he
[4:28] follow his laws. What is the Holy Ghost?
[4:30] God in you. What's it for? to continue
[4:33] his work among his people to bring his
[4:36] church together to bring the church to a
[4:38] place in this day far beyond Lutheran,
[4:40] Methodist, Pentecostal into a place of
[4:43] adoption and rapturing grace and when
[4:45] this part of the church when the spirit
[4:47] moves into this church here it will just
[4:49] raise it bring it forth and all the
[4:52] redeemed that touch that spirit. So
[4:55] actually the bride will have the
[4:57] capstone spirit. I like to bring it as a
[5:00] magnet.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; That magnet anointing. Then
[5:03] &gt;&gt; all them in the grave who are elected,
[5:06] &gt;&gt; they are already magnetized.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; So once this bright magnet is activated,
[5:12] it will pull them right up out of the
[5:14] grave. Hallelujah. Praise God. You must
[5:18] receive the Holy Ghost by one spirit. We
[5:21] are baptized into one body. Oh, glory to
[5:24] God. What is it? It's the spirit of God.
[5:26] What's this for? To lead you, to guide
[5:28] you, to fill you, to sanctify you, to
[5:31] call you out. Oh, glory to God. Thank
[5:34] you, Lord Jesus. And after the seals was
[5:36] open and the prophet preached the token,
[5:39] he said that was the message to cap the
[5:43] seals. That was the capping message.
[5:46] After all the mysteries, after all the
[5:48] revelations, after all the history, the
[5:52] messages were capped off by this
[5:55] particular message, the token. And the
[5:57] token is not doctrine. The token is not
[6:00] teaching. The token is the blood on
[6:04] display. And the blood display like how
[6:07] the blood was on the doorpost in Moses
[6:09] time, but in this time it is the literal
[6:12] life of Jesus, Jesus Christ on display.
[6:15] We're not talking about token applied to
[6:17] the heart now. We're talking about token
[6:18] on the outside. So the life on the
[6:21] inside begin to ooze on the outside. And
[6:24] that's why he said the ministry has
[6:26] reached perfection when Christ is
[6:29] reproduced in the natural. Oh, glory to
[6:31] God. Do you see it now? Hallelujah. So
[6:33] minister can say what they want and say
[6:35] they've adopted and say that ministry
[6:36] and this and that and you're not seeing
[6:38] Jesus. You know something is dead wrong.
[6:39] He said the ministry has come to
[6:41] perfection when Christ is reproduced in
[6:45] natural. Hallelujah. Now we talking
[6:47] about pulpit thing. We're not talking
[6:48] about message thing, a nice message, a
[6:51] nice teacher. We're not talking about
[6:52] that. We're talking about the
[6:53] reproduction of Christ. Oh hallelujah.
[6:56] A life
[6:58] thundering. Oh my. Oh hallelujah. The
[7:02] law and the prophets were until John.
[7:06] Almost finished.
[7:08] Since that time,
[7:10] the kingdom is preached and and every
[7:13] man press into it. He say every man
[7:14] pressed into it, not just simply walk
[7:16] into it easily. It's got to be pressed
[7:18] into.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; It's got to be
[7:21] &gt;&gt; pressed into. Say pressed into wherever
[7:23] you are.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Pressed into.
[7:26] Not shake hand. Not you love your pastor
[7:28] and he he sounding good and he's
[7:30] preaching good and preaching nice. Not
[7:32] that. Forget that. You have to press
[7:34] into the kingdom. Your pastor is not the
[7:37] kingdom. He doesn't control the kingdom.
[7:39] He doesn't have the kingdom. You have to
[7:41] press into the kingdom of God.
[7:44] Hallelujah. Almost finished. Usually it
[7:47] takes a state of emergency to throw us
[7:48] into desperation. It's too bad it has to
[7:50] do that. But human beings are so
[7:52] slothful in their mind. It takes
[7:54] emergency. Something arises. And when
[7:57] they do, it throws them into a
[7:58] desperation. And really in doing that
[8:00] desperation, it brings out the real
[8:03] thing that you are. It shows
[8:05] &gt;&gt; what you are made up of. Hallelujah.
[8:08] Oh, praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. In
[8:12] Egypt time,
[8:14] it was a real tough hour, you know. Was
[8:16] tough because you're hearing the
[8:18] screams, hearing people holling, people
[8:21] balling night because the death angel
[8:24] moving
[8:25] &gt;&gt; and hearing it coming from a distance
[8:27] &gt;&gt; and what you think about it now from a
[8:29] distance crying going on. A mother
[8:32] wailing because her son is dead in a
[8:34] house. That angel just moved through.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet dramatized the children
[8:39] asking the father, "Daddy, are you sure?
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Are you sure we are safe? I hear cries
[8:45] down the road." And the cry is getting
[8:47] nearer and nearer. That's a shaking
[8:48] time.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; You can't eat.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; You can't sleep.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; That's a dreadful night. Actually, that
[8:55] night they wasn't sleeping and rocking
[8:57] that chair. I going to sleep. I going to
[8:58] take a No, no, no. They had the staff in
[9:00] their hand.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, shoes on the feet. It wasn't sleep
[9:04] time, you know. It was time to move out.
[9:06] I wonder if that time coming back again.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; A desperate time. Time to leave this
[9:11] place. Time to leave this world. I
[9:13] wonder if we coming back to that again.
[9:15] Hallelujah. A midnight time. A midnight
[9:18] cry. A midnight hour. People lay back in
[9:20] the message. They relaxing.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Bible say, "Yeah, you're relaxing." But
[9:24] then something going to happen that
[9:26] changes everything.
[9:28] Oh my. Hallelujah. It was a shaking
[9:32] time. The daddy are you short time? You
[9:35] see, when we have genuine love, what
[9:37] does it do? It pushes our faith out to
[9:39] the battle for God. Genuine godly love
[9:42] for God and for his word and for his
[9:45] people will push faith out there. Love
[9:48] just takes a hold of faith. That is why
[9:50] it's important to understand that this
[9:53] faith to pull long charity is based upon
[9:55] forgiveness. If we can love the
[9:57] brethren, if we can have genuine
[9:58] forgiveness and dropping odds, how could
[10:00] we access this presence and power? And I
[10:04] was sharing how we need the Lord. We
[10:06] really need the Lord.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; All this corona virus, the Corona virus,
[10:10] I respect if any message you believe
[10:12] have books, it will knock you out, will
[10:14] kill you
[10:16] &gt;&gt; because it's a judgment.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; That's what it really is. Is debt.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Are you following me now?
[10:21] &gt;&gt; No. We need the Lord. We need his
[10:23] spirit. We need his power. It is
[10:25] promised. We cannot say send it now. We
[10:28] want it now. We would like to have it
[10:29] now. We are not in charge of that. Like
[10:32] Peter, he was just speaking. But the
[10:34] Holy Ghost fell
[10:35] &gt;&gt; on them. The word seed was going out and
[10:38] the spirit was there to water that seed
[10:40] and make the word spoken made manifest
[10:43] and b them into the kingdom of God. Word
[10:46] turned to spirit in their life. They
[10:48] receive it spirit word into their hearts
[10:51] out of Peter's mouth because Peter is in
[10:53] the body. So he's a dramatized son. He's
[10:57] a channel of God. Hallelujah. Life is
[11:00] flowing through Peter. Eternal life. Oh,
[11:02] glory to God. Zoe, God's own life. Fire
[11:05] from off the altar. Oh, glory to God.
[11:08] The man a even baptized in Jesus name
[11:10] yet. The man never went to one service.
[11:13] The man listened to one book, one tape,
[11:15] but he had testimony from a living
[11:17] witness. That is no dead scripture. That
[11:19] is a living witness. Those b those
[11:21] brothers was written epistles.
[11:23] Hallelujah. That was a living word
[11:25] talking to them. That was a living word
[11:27] preaching to Cornelius's house. The text
[11:29] of what Peter was preaching wasn't
[11:31] written yet. He was living it out.
[11:33] Hallelujah. And the devil had to move
[11:35] out. Oh, glory to God. Isn't this
[11:37] wonderful tonight? Hallelujah. But I'm
[11:39] say God will always meet a desperate
[11:41] soul. He says usually it takes something
[11:44] to drive us into that to that despair to
[11:47] that desperation. It takes something to
[11:49] do. James 5:15, the effectual fervent
[11:52] prayer of a righteous man availth much.
[11:54] The effectual fervent prayer. He said
[11:57] that is desperation. What is
[11:58] desperation? Effectual fervent prayer.
[12:00] It's similar to he that committed God
[12:02] must believe that he is and he's a
[12:03] reward of them that diligently,
[12:05] energetically, fervently seek him. So
[12:07] there's a way to seek God. Father, oh I
[12:10] love you, Lord. And you know it is not
[12:12] no desperation. That just talk a
[12:15] Trinidad hiding under the the breath of
[12:17] prayer. We're not talking about that
[12:18] kind of thing. You know, when you're
[12:19] desperate, it reflects in your action,
[12:22] your attitude. It reflects in your
[12:24] desires and everything else. Oh, glory
[12:26] to God. The effectual fervent prayer of
[12:28] a righteous man.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Fervent prayer.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And as in the Bible
[12:32] teaching when Elijah Elisha didn't know
[12:35] what is wrong with the child, God didn't
[12:37] tell him everything. He started to pace
[12:38] the floor. He started to pace the floor.
[12:41] Start to what happening? He's
[12:42] desperation. He want to know what
[12:43] happening. The child fall dead. This
[12:45] can't work. I give the woman a promise
[12:46] and this can't happen. And hallelujah.
[12:48] They put the child in the room getting
[12:50] desperate. Hallelujah. He paced on the
[12:52] floor. But I'm saying he paced on the
[12:53] floor. Why? Something moving in him.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, is your will. If God if
[12:57] it be your will, Lord. Um if the child
[13:00] live, will he live? Die, die. We bury
[13:02] him." No, it wasn't. That wasn't it.
[13:04] That what we have now. Lord, if it's
[13:06] your will and people just accept the
[13:08] condition, accept the diabetes, accept
[13:10] cancer, accept tumor, accept whatever
[13:12] they want to accept because if God be
[13:15] for us, we are the miracles. Hallelujah.
[13:17] Where's the desperation to see the
[13:19] miracle? Now, if we don't say this, if
[13:21] we don't preach, people wouldn't expect
[13:22] miracles. They expect to be dead and
[13:24] buried. They expect to sick and die.
[13:27] Where are the miracles if God before us?
[13:29] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Jacob, we find out, we
[13:35] know Jacob, he he he had to meet his
[13:37] brother, Esau. He sent his wives one
[13:39] way, children one way and everything
[13:40] else. But Jacob falling on his knees and
[13:43] then he get desperate. Hallelujah. says
[13:45] and to that the that's the only way
[13:47] you'll able to get to achieve the thing
[13:49] that you're wanting is to desperately
[13:52] come. I must have it tonight. I get it
[13:54] now or I'm finished. Tomorrow is too
[13:56] late. I have to have now. And I read
[13:59] this because I want to bring this next
[14:00] part. When you pray for the baptism of
[14:05] the Holy Spirit, the token,
[14:08] &gt;&gt; here we call it. When you pray for the
[14:12] baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token,
[14:15] don't say, "Well, now I'll go up and
[14:17] try. Lord, I'm a little tired." He say,
[14:20] "Oh, mercy." Stay in your seat. Don't
[14:22] even make an attempt. If you come and
[14:25] say, "I'll pass through the prayer line.
[14:26] Put oil in my head. I'll see if it does
[14:28] me any good. You might as well sit where
[14:31] you are until you get to that place
[14:33] until the whole church here we go. until
[14:38] the whole church gets to a place that is
[14:40] between life and death. Then you you you
[14:43] have it have it now a perish then God
[14:46] will move on the scene. It takes
[14:48] desperation to bring God on the scene.
[14:50] We know Jacob got desperate and then
[14:52] Jacob holding on and so on and some
[14:55] people say I see a light. He said glory
[14:57] to God. He said there you are you
[14:58] deceived. Somebody said I feel so good
[15:00] brother Brandham. I went down there and
[15:01] prayed. Shivers run over me. That might
[15:03] have been God. I saw a light that still
[15:05] might have been God, but that ain't what
[15:07] I'm talking about. He's talking about
[15:08] Jacob stayed there until something
[15:11] happened that make him walk different,
[15:13] made him a different person because he
[15:16] stayed until something happened. Not
[15:19] until he hear a good message. You find I
[15:23] will be beating that and I will keep
[15:24] beating it until it strike home. Not
[15:26] until you hear another sermon. We are
[15:28] people who sit and hear a sermon and say
[15:30] amen. And they live they live in rotten.
[15:33] They are terrible people people terrible
[15:35] behave
[15:37] but they're doing a duty. Amen. Amen.
[15:38] That's the word. Nothing happened to
[15:40] them.
[15:43] Nothing happened to them. They are
[15:44] ameners of word. Hallelujah. The amen in
[15:48] word and when they leave they forget
[15:50] what what the word they amen. Oh
[15:52] hallelujah.
[15:54] My God. But here this bomb here now.
[15:57] Jacob stayed here until something
[15:59] happened that made him walk different.
[16:00] made him a different person because he
[16:03] stayed until that happened. The Bible
[16:06] said he held until he prevailed. How can
[16:08] a man prevail over God? But you can do
[16:10] it. You can do it. A man can prevail
[16:13] over God. But you can't be desperate
[16:15] till God speaks to you. So you have to
[16:18] hear direct from God. You say, "Oh
[16:20] church, rise, shake yourself, pinch your
[16:22] conscience, wake yourself up in this
[16:23] hour. We must be desperate or perish."
[16:26] There is coming forth something from the
[16:27] Lord. I know it as dust, say the Lord.
[16:29] There is coming forth something and we
[16:31] better be desperate is between life and
[16:32] death. It will pass through us and we
[16:34] won't see it. Blind Batimus when he
[16:37] cried out to Jesus they tell him you're
[16:39] making shut up. It made too much a noise
[16:41] but he was desperate and he what you do
[16:43] he screamed out he say oh Jesus no
[16:46] matter they told him to stop he cried
[16:48] out just the same that more louder when
[16:51] they told him to shut up it made him get
[16:52] louder because he was desperate.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Nobody could stop him. He said, "Lord
[16:57] have mercy upon me." That was enough.
[17:00] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. And Christ
[17:03] left what he was doing to minister to
[17:05] him because God always respond to a
[17:07] desperate soul. Musician come please.
[17:10] Desperation calls for a subject. And
[17:12] when the subject, no matter how faint it
[17:14] is, it's received. It is believed right
[17:16] then. Oh my. Peter, we know Peter, he
[17:19] fell in the water and so on. And he
[17:22] said, "Christians, tonight if you're in
[17:23] a line of duty trying to follow the
[17:25] leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer
[17:27] grab you, death grabs you, a cancer tub
[17:30] or what whatever it is." He said,
[17:33] "Scream out and said, "Lord, save me."
[17:35] Hallelujah. God heard him in the line of
[17:38] duty. He started to sink. He failed. No
[17:40] matter if you fail, that don't have
[17:42] nothing to do with it. I think worth
[17:44] reading again.
[17:47] God heard him. He said in the line of
[17:50] duty he started to sink. He failed. No
[17:53] matter if you fail that don't have
[17:57] nothing to do with it. We all fail. We
[18:01] are failed to begin with. But we got
[18:04] somebody standing now with a strong hand
[18:06] who can reach us and take us above the
[18:08] water. And if you make a mistake, some
[18:10] woman make a mistake, some man made a
[18:13] mistake, some boy or girl made a
[18:15] mistake, don't sink. Scream out in
[18:18] despair, "Lord, save me or I'll perish.
[18:21] Get desperate about it." God will hear
[18:23] you. He always hears a desperate soul.
[18:28] Oh my. And Jesus is humility. He said,
[18:32] "Not my will but thine be done." He
[18:34] prayed earnestly. He said, "Brother,
[18:36] sister, if Jesus had to pray earnestly,
[18:38] how much more have we got to pray
[18:39] earnestly?" If God of heaven made flesh
[18:42] had to pray earnestly, then how much
[18:44] more we are sinners saved by grace. So
[18:46] where are we putting all the arrogance
[18:48] that we see in this message? All the
[18:50] hostile behavior, all the proud and and
[18:53] so on like that. And people believe that
[18:56] because they have a book or tape or
[18:58] believe this message that everything is
[19:00] fine. They just made it over already.
[19:02] They are deceived. Devil deceived them.
[19:04] Fully deceived.
[19:06] They failed to understand that those two
[19:09] million people that came out of Egypt
[19:11] wasn't going to make it to the promised
[19:12] land. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:16] Two million people come out under Moses
[19:18] tapes, books and tapes and Moses
[19:20] message. They all say we going.
[19:22] Hallelujah. We're going to the Red Sea.
[19:24] Hallelujah. But they couldn't see the
[19:26] carcass fall in the wilderness. They
[19:27] couldn't see the time begin to unfold
[19:30] and reveal the unbelief in their system.
[19:33] They couldn't see the God that sees the
[19:35] end from the beginning saw the next
[19:37] generation moving in.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see their children is who
[19:41] going to cross over with Joshua and
[19:42] Caleb. They couldn't see that
[19:44] &gt;&gt; their attitudes and their mindset was so
[19:46] difficult and tough that God say you
[19:48] know what not one of them going over
[19:50] their children will go over their
[19:52] children will cross over. Hallelujah is
[19:55] God we serve. I think the last message
[19:57] we preach on talk about Ezekiel 9 about
[20:01] the inorn writer and you know what the
[20:04] Bible says start
[20:07] in my sanctuary and then they begin at
[20:11] the ancient men before the house before
[20:14] destruction strike the city before
[20:17] destruction strike Los Angeles before
[20:20] destruction strikes the world he will
[20:23] start in his house to the very people
[20:25] who claim to believe him, love him and
[20:27] serve him.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Begin at my sanctuary."
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Judgment actually begins right there and
[20:34] from there it goes out.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Begin at my sanctuary. This is not a
[20:40] game. This message is not a play thing.
[20:43] This is the word from the Lord. And the
[20:45] word of the Lord came unto me saying,
[20:47] "Oh, glory to God. When that word come,
[20:49] that word can't fail because that word
[20:51] is God." Oh, hallelujah.
[20:54] Thank you Jesus.
[20:56] But Brandham says the people had their
[20:59] own camp but they had to change their
[21:01] campgrounds in order to see the
[21:03] supernatural.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; When God deal with the people for many
[21:06] years, God is not in the camp anymore
[21:08] because they made theelves a self-made
[21:10] camp,
[21:11] &gt;&gt; not God's camp of his word, a camp of
[21:14] their own. He had to leave them for he
[21:17] is the word. And he cannot stay where
[21:20] people are taught out of the word. Every
[21:22] group that off the word God can't stay
[21:25] there. Yes, they acknowledging this and
[21:28] God prophet he move out already because
[21:30] God and the word is the same. That's why
[21:32] he say what the tape say. Don't say with
[21:34] no cuckoo revelation, no new revelation.
[21:36] Some revelation the prophet did not
[21:37] bring and it's sing good but it's not
[21:40] the scriptures. It can't match all from
[21:42] Genesis to revelation. Hallelujah. So I
[21:45] to stay with this.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who vex loss? Glory to God.
[21:50] I'm going to close.
[21:52] If you are not in the kingdom of God,
[21:54] press into it. Surely I would have
[21:57] knowledge of what I'm speaking of. God
[21:59] would never honor my prayer to do what
[22:01] he does and you are outside the kingdom.
[22:03] Seek Christ as your refuge now. Oh my.
[22:07] You say, "Man, press into it." You don't
[22:09] just stand around and say, "Pick me up
[22:11] by the color, Lord. Push me in." You
[22:13] press into it. You get desperate between
[22:15] life and death. Oh my. You begin to play
[22:18] something. I'm done tonight. And this is
[22:21] what I had to share with you tonight.
[22:24] Oh, glory to God. The purpose that God
[22:26] sent the Holy Ghost. He says he's
[22:27] waiting for the manifestation of the
[22:29] sons of God. When God will make himself
[22:32] known.
[22:33] Oh my. For 50 years, God has made
[22:35] himself known by scriptures, by text, by
[22:38] revelation, by the word since the
[22:40] prophet have left. But we're talking
[22:42] about waiting for the manifestation of
[22:46] the sons of God. When God will make
[22:48] himself known when they will stop
[22:51] sickness, they will stop cancer. They
[22:55] will stop diseases. You think cancer is
[22:57] something? The Bible said there will
[22:59] come a time when men will rot right in
[23:01] their flesh and the buzzers will eat off
[23:04] the carcasses before they even die.
[23:07] Cancer is a two take to what's coming.
[23:10] But remember that horrible thing was
[23:11] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[23:14] are the seat of God. That's what we are
[23:16] striving for now to get in and be
[23:20] positionally placed into the kingdom of
[23:21] God before these horrible plagues
[23:24] strike. Corona virus that is not the
[23:27] end. It have more plagues coming. It
[23:30] have worse coming. That is just a tip of
[23:33] the iceberg that the Lord could show
[23:35] what he can do, what he can allow, what
[23:38] he can permit, what he can show to man
[23:41] with all his intelligence and in all his
[23:43] science and all his technology. He can
[23:46] show that something that your eyes can't
[23:47] see. Hallelujah. Is affecting people,
[23:51] affecting lives. And all around you
[23:54] seeing mask all over the world because
[23:57] people don't want to get this virus as
[24:00] he says. Oh, glory to God. But there is
[24:04] another there's a inoculation of the
[24:06] Holy Ghost
[24:08] that God want to give oh to whosoever
[24:11] will. Who wants it? Who wants the Holy
[24:13] Ghost tonight? Who wants to reach out
[24:15] tonight? Oh, glory to God. Would you
[24:18] sing that, brother?
[24:22] Reach out. You hear the word,
[24:26] &gt;&gt; but where's the time to reach out and
[24:28] touch the Lord? Where's the time to say,
[24:30] "Lord, I need you. I want more of you."
[24:33] We want to give it that time.
[24:35] He's passing by.
[24:37] Very moment
[24:40] your needs to supply.
[24:46] reach out
[24:48] and touch the Lord
[24:51] as we
[24:54] he passes by. I hope you're not dull. I
[24:58] hope you're not
[25:00] just numb that you can't reach out. I
[25:04] hope that in your heart, in your spirit,
[25:05] you could say, "Lord, I I don't know
[25:08] what other church members are doing. I
[25:10] don't know what other believers doing,
[25:11] but I'm going to reach out tonight. I'm
[25:12] going to reach out and say, Lord, help
[25:14] me tonight. Put that desperation in me,
[25:16] Lord. Put that thirst in me, Lord.
[25:19] Create a revival in me, Lord. Oh, God.
[25:21] I'm here. I'm I'm I'm in need, Lord. I'm
[25:24] in need of you, Father. I need your
[25:25] spirit. Oh, hallelujah. Won't you reach
[25:27] out tonight right where you are in your
[25:29] homes? Would you raise your hands and
[25:31] just give God a a wave offering and
[25:34] reach out to him as you talk to him a
[25:35] little bit? Hallelujah. Father God, I
[25:38] pray tonight that your Holy Spirit will
[25:40] go into the homes, hands raised, Lord,
[25:43] and visit them, Lord. Those that needed
[25:44] healing under those hands, heal them,
[25:46] Lord. Touch eyes, touch hearts, touch
[25:50] atritic conditions, pressure, diabet,
[25:53] diabetic conditions. Lord answer prayer,
[25:56] financial needs, spiritual needs,
[25:59] deliverances, restoration, a stirring,
[26:03] Lord, to make a stand, a solid rock
[26:05] stand like root. Where you go, I'll go.
[26:07] Where you die, I'll die. Where you be
[26:09] buried, I'll be buried. A clay cut
[26:12] decision, Father, to serve with all
[26:14] their hearts. Lord, you send the Holy
[26:16] Ghost for a purpose. And that purpose is
[26:18] here, Father God, to be made manifest in
[26:20] the lives of your people. You want to
[26:22] come down that you could say the but we
[26:24] could say the Lord himself is here
[26:26] confirming the word with signs
[26:28] following. Father anoint your people
[26:29] with a cry to get in the spirit. A
[26:31] fervent desire to please you Lord. Grant
[26:33] it father in Jesus name I ask it.
[26:35] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[26:37] Oh thank you Lord Jesus.

[50:12] Give the Lord a shout of praise one more
[50:14] time. Father, we thank you. We praise
[50:17] you. We thank you for your word today.
[50:20] We thank you for your presence, your
[50:22] power, your spirit. Oh, hallelujah.
[50:27] Hallelujah.
[50:29] [Music]
[50:30] Oh, the purpose of God
[50:34] sending the Holy Ghost. What a message
[50:37] from the Lord. Do you appreciate the
[50:38] word this morning?
[50:41] Oh, we appreciate the team.
[50:44] My God.
[50:46] So, let's get ready. We want to take the
[50:48] tithe offering. Offer with a prayer for
[50:50] it this morning.
[50:52] We are basking in the presence of God
[50:55] this morning.
[50:57] Amen. And cognizant of his presence with
[51:00] us today, let's just bow our heads as we
[51:04] ask God's blessings. Amen.
[51:07] Almighty God, Lord,
[51:11] our hearts are full. Lord, we we thank
[51:15] you Lord. You have poured out grace upon
[51:18] us today. Father, we thank you for your
[51:21] presence, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your
[51:24] hand in our lives, your hand of
[51:25] provision. Lord, now as we just pause to
[51:29] bring the offerings and tithes before
[51:32] you, Lord God, we pray that you bless it
[51:34] as it would be picked up. Lord, bless
[51:37] each one as they give. May you provide
[51:40] for them, Father, in a special way.
[51:42] Bless the ministry there, God, as we
[51:44] continue to labor in the vineyard, Lord.
[51:47] Lord, for the ministry there, God, and
[51:50] putting all these natural things,
[51:51] substances, Lord, towards the glory of
[51:53] God. We pray bless these things in Jesus
[51:56] name. Amen.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[52:00] Hallelujah. Lord, I want to be a
[52:05] Christian
[52:07] in my heart.
[52:10] Let's get ready to hand it out.
[52:12] Lord, I want to be. Let's lift our hand
[52:17] and sing
[52:19] in my heart.
[52:23] [Music]
[52:25] In my heart,
[52:28] [Music]
[52:31] in my heart,
[52:37] Lord, I want to be a Christian
[52:45] in my heart.
[52:49] Lord, I want to be holy. Lord, I want to
[52:54] be
[52:55] more holy
[52:57] in my heart.
[53:03] Oh Lord, I want to be more
[53:11] in my arms.
[53:18] in my heart.
[53:22] [Music]
[53:28] In my heart, Jesus. Oh, I want to be
[53:35] more holy
[53:37] in my heart.
[53:41] Oh, I want to be like Jesus. Oh Lord, I
[53:45] want to be like Jesus
[53:50] in my heart
[53:54] in my heart. Oh Lord,
[53:59] I want to be
[54:02] like Jesus
[54:04] in my heart.
[54:10] In my heart.
[54:13] [Music]
[54:16] in my heart
[54:21] go.
[54:23] Oh, I want
[54:26] to be like Jesus. Oh, in my heart.
[54:32] One more time. I want to be a Christian.
[54:35] Oh Lord, I want to be
[54:40] a Christian
[54:42] in my heart.
[54:47] Oh Lord, I want to be
[54:53] a Christian
[54:55] in my heart.
[55:01] Oh, in my heart with all your heart now.
[55:05] Oh, sing to him. Oh, in my heart.
[55:14] Oh Lord,
[55:16] I want to be
[55:19] a Christian
[55:21] in my heart.
[55:26] Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand of
[55:28] praise?
[55:34] We appreciate the Lord this morning.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; What a service.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; What a word in due season.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; To think that that message was preached.
[55:46] I believe there was nobody in the
[55:48] building at the time during the co and
[55:52] that was torred up grain. It's as if it
[55:55] was preached out of season just for
[55:57] today.
[55:59] and to see the Holy Spirit follow the
[56:01] word to confirm the word with a
[56:04] visitation to you that he is still real.
[56:07] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[56:08] forever. And this is just an appetizer
[56:11] of what God has in store. Because I
[56:14] believe in this week, spiritual history
[56:16] is about to be made. Not by the work of
[56:19] man, but the Lord himself just
[56:22] completing the word that he promised to
[56:24] pour out the Holy Ghost to bring
[56:26] deliverance to the captives, to break
[56:29] chains and shackles.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we give the Lord one more hand
[56:35] of praise?
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:44] &gt;&gt; We do have two notes of praise.
[56:49] I want to thank God and the scenes for
[56:51] prayers. In less than a week, they are
[56:52] both home. God is great. This is from
[56:54] Sister Janice. I believe her sister and
[56:56] her uncle, they were both in the
[56:58] hospital, I believe, but now they are
[56:59] they are back at home. So, we thank God
[57:01] that he's a prayer answering God.
[57:08] and Sister Grace
[57:11] Knight
[57:17] thanking God for 67 years he has given
[57:20] me last Thursday. Thank you for your
[57:21] love and blessings on my birthday. God
[57:23] bless you. Happy birthday, Sister Grace.
[57:26] May God grant you many more years in the
[57:30] service of the Lord. We do have one
[57:33] prayer request from brother Robert for
[57:35] his cousin Wendel Lal for healing from
[57:39] Jon this and also for the salvation of
[57:41] his soul. And if there's any request
[57:43] this morning, you could play something
[57:45] softly as we approach the throne of
[57:46] grace this morning.
[57:49] You want to show by raising hands
[57:52] as we approach the Lord. There are many
[57:55] needs all over the building
[57:57] downstairs. those that are connected,
[57:59] those who may hear the tape as we
[58:02] approach the throne of grace this
[58:04] morning. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[58:05] for your love, for your mercy, Lord, for
[58:09] what you have done, what you are doing,
[58:11] and Lord, what you're about to do. Lord,
[58:14] we have stood behind this sacred desk,
[58:17] Lord, many times and seen prayer
[58:19] requests, Lord, brought before your
[58:22] people in agreement, Lord, as your word
[58:24] declares, if two shall agree, touching
[58:27] anything, we can have whatever we ask
[58:29] for. And we have stood in agreement many
[58:31] times, Lord, and brought these requests
[58:33] before you. And you have seen it fit,
[58:35] Father, to answer prayer. So this
[58:38] morning father we bring Lord Wendel Lal
[58:41] Lord for healing of Jaundice and for the
[58:43] salvation of his soul that even now the
[58:45] angel of the Lord will visit him father
[58:48] that he will know that you are real
[58:50] father and you are the same yesterday
[58:52] today and forever and Lord for every
[58:54] hand that was raised all over the
[58:56] building that the angel of the Lord who
[58:58] knows the thoughts of the heart Lord not
[59:00] just of the mind but of the hearts of
[59:02] the people father for the desires of the
[59:05] people for Lord mothers and fathers
[59:07] fathers, Lord, with a burden for their
[59:09] young people and their children. And
[59:11] Lord, for those that are burdened with
[59:13] family situations, Lord, those that are
[59:15] burdened with financial challenges,
[59:18] those that are burdened with health
[59:19] challenges and issues, those that are
[59:21] burdened with, Lord, all kind of diverse
[59:24] conditions, but Father, you are still
[59:25] the great way maker. You are still the
[59:28] great miracle worker. You are still the
[59:30] great physician. You are still the great
[59:33] way maker, Father. So we come this
[59:35] morning bringing every need before you,
[59:37] every prayer, every situation, every
[59:40] supplication, Lord. Everything that may
[59:42] be overwhelming to your people, knowing
[59:44] that they can cast all their cares upon
[59:46] you this morning, Father, we pray that
[59:48] you would touch your people, you would
[59:50] strengthen your people one more time,
[59:52] Father. And Lord, as we prepare for the
[59:55] convention this week, may you strengthen
[59:57] your church. May you grant traveling
[59:59] mercies to those that are flying in for
[1:00:01] the meeting. May you bless the local
[1:00:03] churches that would support the
[1:00:04] convention. May you bless the local
[1:00:07] church here, Father. Lord, may you
[1:00:09] strengthen the ranks of the deacons,
[1:00:11] Lord. May you strengthen the ushers,
[1:00:13] Father. May you bless the musicians,
[1:00:16] Father. May you touch the technical
[1:00:18] team, Lord. those that in the parking
[1:00:20] lot, Lord. Those that are in the nursery
[1:00:23] and the choir room, those that will be
[1:00:24] in the kitchen, Father. Lord, may you
[1:00:26] touch the song leaders and the
[1:00:28] worshippers, the singers, Lord, and
[1:00:31] those that will take a part, Father.
[1:00:36] Lord, may you bless the ministers that
[1:00:37] would bring greetings, Father. May they
[1:00:39] be like flaming swords uh fresh from the
[1:00:42] presence of Almighty God. Lord, may
[1:00:45] nothing be said that you don't once
[1:00:47] said, and may only what you once said be
[1:00:50] said. May spirit spoken words utter from
[1:00:53] each son of God, those that would
[1:00:56] minister the words, Father, from behind
[1:00:58] the fire, the altar of fire. Lord, may
[1:01:02] this island shake under the power and
[1:01:05] impact of the Holy Ghost. Lord, may the
[1:01:07] world shake under the power of the Holy
[1:01:10] Ghost. We know this message is real. We
[1:01:13] know that you are real, Lord. We know
[1:01:15] there's no problem you cannot solve. And
[1:01:18] we believe that for such a time as this,
[1:01:20] Father, Lord, all things are ready. Let
[1:01:23] the fire fall. May you anoint each
[1:01:26] brother, every sister. May the
[1:01:28] backsliders be restored. May the sick be
[1:01:32] healed. Uh may the blind eyes pop open.
[1:01:35] May those that have been hanging on. Uh
[1:01:37] may they be brought to strength. Father,
[1:01:40] you promise there'll be one more ride.
[1:01:42] You promise there'll be a last great
[1:01:44] kill. You promise we leap over walls.
[1:01:47] You promise Joel's army will rise again.
[1:01:50] You promise a restoration. You promise a
[1:01:53] super churchuh. You promise a seventh
[1:01:55] and a revival. You promise that the
[1:01:57] promise of the Holy Ghost uh is just as
[1:02:00] real uh as it was in the day of
[1:02:02] Pentecost uh and we claim and identify
[1:02:05] every single promise uh not one shall be
[1:02:08] left behind.
[1:02:09] Lord, as Moses uh was preparing to leave
[1:02:12] Egypt, uh he said not one uh shall be
[1:02:15] left behind, uh Lord, in this season. We
[1:02:19] pray for our families. Uh we pray for
[1:02:21] our loved ones. Uh we pray for the
[1:02:23] weaker ones. Uh your prophet taught us
[1:02:25] the third Pope is for the weaker ones.
[1:02:28] Uh Father, may the faith banks rise. Uh
[1:02:31] even the Lord Jesus said, "I prayed for
[1:02:33] you that your faith don't fail."
[1:02:36] So father we approach this week with
[1:02:38] faith. We approach this week with
[1:02:40] confidence. The devil could do what he
[1:02:43] wants to do. But we have a revelation of
[1:02:45] who we are, who's we are, what our
[1:02:48] promise is, what your purpose is. Lord,
[1:02:50] you have inspired our pastor with a
[1:02:52] vision for this meeting. Father, it's no
[1:02:55] longer about man, but we are walking in
[1:02:57] the heavenly vision. Father, for sir, is
[1:03:00] this the time for the manifestation of
[1:03:02] the sons of God?
[1:03:06] So may you have your way. May everything
[1:03:08] be done in order in decency. Lord, may
[1:03:13] your spirit be pleased to move into the
[1:03:16] camp, Lord. We are a needy people. We
[1:03:19] are not a perfect people, but you
[1:03:21] promise a ministry of perfection, Lord.
[1:03:24] We come with our cups empty, Lord. And
[1:03:26] to see how you have shown yourself alive
[1:03:28] to us this morning to remind us that
[1:03:31] it's not a work of man. It's not our
[1:03:33] natural effort. You said if except the
[1:03:35] Lord build a house, they labor in vain
[1:03:37] that build it. Father, Lord, we could
[1:03:39] only do what we could do. But you said
[1:03:40] we got to do something for something to
[1:03:42] happen. So, Father, it's your
[1:03:44] convention. Lord, it's not our
[1:03:46] convention. It's your convention. Have
[1:03:48] your way. If you need to break us, break
[1:03:50] us. If you need to change us, change us.
[1:03:53] Whatever you want to do, we open every
[1:03:55] door. The prophet beats doors in doors.
[1:03:57] Uh we open every door this morning. the
[1:04:00] doors to our cars, the doors to our
[1:04:02] homes, the doors to our hearts, the
[1:04:04] doors into our situations. Have the
[1:04:07] liberty, have your perfect way. Lord,
[1:04:09] you are the potter. We are the clay.
[1:04:11] Father,
[1:04:12] may you touch your people. May you bless
[1:04:15] the services, Lord. Seven services. Go
[1:04:19] look seven times, seven voices, seven
[1:04:23] thunders, seven church ages. the
[1:04:26] ministry of that seventh messenger to
[1:04:28] our final people who will be the final
[1:04:31] voice to the final age. Father, may
[1:04:33] every service go higher and higher.
[1:04:35] Lord, may the ministers be hardly able
[1:04:37] to minister because you would step down.
[1:04:40] Lord, you promise a pillar of fire will
[1:04:42] rest on the shoulders of the adopted
[1:04:45] sons. Uh may this be that season, Lord.
[1:04:47] We have not been this way before, but we
[1:04:49] have been here for a long time. Uh Lord,
[1:04:51] you said we don't need to know the
[1:04:53] mechanics. But we need the dynamics,
[1:04:55] Father. So, Father, let the dynamics
[1:04:57] fall.
[1:04:59] Strengthen your people one more time. We
[1:05:01] give it over to you, Lord. Bless every
[1:05:04] service. Bless the efforts. May you give
[1:05:06] us strength that we don't even know.
[1:05:08] Father, may you be with us, Father.
[1:05:10] Strengthen us in the inner man. Those

[1:06:02] and as only the eagle could renew his
[1:06:04] strength.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for renewal of
[1:06:06] strength
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; as we go into this week. So, may the
[1:06:09] Lord richly bless you. We want to
[1:06:11] welcome Beverly Pikton, invited by
[1:06:13] Sister Meen. God bless you. Welcome.
[1:06:15] Thank you so much for coming. We trust
[1:06:16] that you are blessed. God bless you.
[1:06:20] So service continues for the convention.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this coming Friday, we have two
[1:06:28] services. The service times have been
[1:06:31] published. But just to remind you, this
[1:06:33] coming Friday service at 2:00 p.m. and
[1:06:36] at 700 p.m. This coming Saturday, three
[1:06:39] services, 10:00 a.m., 300 p.m. and 700
[1:06:42] p.m. And this coming Sunday, two
[1:06:45] services, 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. We
[1:06:49] want to encourage the church, make every
[1:06:51] effort to be on time, to be available to
[1:06:55] provide whatever support is required. We
[1:06:58] will have our final full meeting of
[1:07:01] those who have a part to play in the
[1:07:03] convention and those who are offering
[1:07:06] their service to support. We'll have it
[1:07:07] at the back of the church after service
[1:07:10] just to align on a few things uh for a
[1:07:13] number of different areas that we just
[1:07:15] want to make sure we are all on the same
[1:07:17] page on. Maintainance team group one,
[1:07:20] please meet with brother Pockwell after
[1:07:22] the service and during the convention.
[1:07:24] We welcome any support with maintainance
[1:07:27] during the services. With respect to the
[1:07:30] convention meals, we want today to be
[1:07:34] the final day to close off registration
[1:07:37] for our church. I want you to appreciate
[1:07:40] that there are quite a number of
[1:07:41] different logistics from our local
[1:07:43] church to those that are flying in to
[1:07:46] manage how we take care of those as well
[1:07:49] as the dynamics of the various local
[1:07:51] churches that would visit that would
[1:07:53] visit the convention. So for our local
[1:07:55] church, we want to encourage you to get
[1:07:59] any orders you have in today so that we
[1:08:02] could have a very clear picture as we go
[1:08:04] into this week. And uh
[1:08:08] I think that should be it. All right. So
[1:08:12] may the Lord bless you. Am I forgetting
[1:08:14] anything, brothers?
[1:08:27] Okay, cool. So, uh I'm hearing that
[1:08:30] brother Pwell, today is your birthday.
[1:08:34] I know that you have been getting
[1:08:36] birthday greetings on random days,
[1:08:39] but I think today we finally got it
[1:08:41] right. So, brother Popp, may God bless
[1:08:44] you on your birthday and I believe it's
[1:08:45] sister Donna K's birthday as well. Is it
[1:08:48] true today as well? So, happy birthday
[1:08:51] and may God give you both a birthday
[1:08:54] gift this week
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; by a new birth and a experience with the
[1:08:59] Holy Ghost.
[1:09:15] Okay. Wonderful. So, may the Lord richly
[1:09:16] bless you. Musicians, you could play
[1:09:19] something. And church, be under
[1:09:22] expectation.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Be under great expectation.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You get what you
[1:09:28] expect." Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And if you come expecting great things,
[1:09:32] I have never seen God fail yet.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Dig a valley full of ditches."
[1:09:36] Because if you expect rain to fall, the
[1:09:38] more of a valley you dig is the more
[1:09:40] water you could hold.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Brother wants me to remind you, don't
[1:09:47] run off like a speeding bullet. I think
[1:09:49] he used that phrase last week as well.
[1:09:51] He said, "There's a lot of work to be
[1:09:53] done. We appreciate every hand that's
[1:09:55] available to support as today is the
[1:09:58] last major day we are all here. So if
[1:10:00] you could lend your support we would
[1:10:02] appreciate that. May the Lord bless you.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It's a new day.

[1:10:13] is coming my way.
