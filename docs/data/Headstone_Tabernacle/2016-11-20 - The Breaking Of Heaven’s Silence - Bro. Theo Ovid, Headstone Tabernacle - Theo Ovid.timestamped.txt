[5:34] atmosphere that we feel in the building
[5:37] this
[5:38] morning oh praise the Lord Revelation
[5:40] chapter
[5:45] 5 and I saw on the right hand of a him
[5:48] that sat on the throne a book written
[5:49] within on the backside seal with Seven
[5:52] Seals and I saw a loud Angel strong
[5:55] Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is
[5:58] worthy to open the book of and to loose
[6:00] the seals thereof and no man in Heaven
[6:02] Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[6:04] able to open the book neither to look
[6:06] there on and I wept
[6:08] much because no man was found worthy to
[6:11] open and to read the book neither to
[6:13] look thereon and one of the elders said
[6:16] unto me weep not behold the L of the
[6:20] tribe of Judah the root of David
[6:23] Hallelujah had prevailed to open the
[6:25] book and to loose the Seven Seals
[6:28] thereof and I beheld low in the midst of
[6:30] the throne and of the four beasts in the
[6:31] midst of the four and the elders to the
[6:33] lamb as it had been slain having seven
[6:36] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[6:38] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[6:40] Earth he came and took the book out of
[6:43] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[6:44] throne and when he had taken the book
[6:47] The Four beasts the four and 20 Elders
[6:49] fell down before the lamb having every
[6:51] one of them HPS and golden vials full of
[6:54] odors which are the prayers of the
[6:57] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[7:01] thou worthy to take the book and to open
[7:04] the seals thereof for thou was slain and
[7:07] has redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[7:12] of every Kindred and tongue and people
[7:15] and Nation Revelation 8 reading verse
[7:21] 1-5 and when he had opened the seventh
[7:24] seal there was silence in heaven about a
[7:28] space of half an hour
[7:30] and I saw the seven angels which stood
[7:32] before God and to them were given seven
[7:35] trumpets and another angel came and
[7:37] stood at the altar having a golden
[7:40] sensor and there was given unto him much
[7:42] incense that he should offer it with the
[7:46] prayers of All Saints upon the golden
[7:48] altar which was before the throne and
[7:52] the smoke of the incense which came with
[7:54] the prayers of the Saints Hallelujah
[7:56] ascended up before God out of the
[7:58] Angel's hand and the angel took the
[8:01] sensor filled it with fire of the altar
[8:05] cast it unto the Earth and there were
[8:09] voices and
[8:11] thunderings and
[8:13] Lightnings and an earthquake let us pray

[17:00] are not the
[17:03] believer the believer is the word in
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:22] you let me just get crack in
[17:25] here our righteousness
[17:31] is filthy
[17:33] rags you see your best foot forward you
[17:37] praying and you seeking the Lord and so
[17:39] on filthy
[17:40] rags that's what you do you pray you

[17:48] with
[17:49] that so God will even hear you yes you

[18:45] Heaven have to open up and I feel this
[18:49] morning something going to break
[18:51] something going to take place right in
[18:54] this place right in this building right
[18:57] among you
[19:00] [Applause]
[19:06] don't bother with what the senses
[19:09] declare you may be seated Our Father
[19:12] Abraham demonstrated a life of faith
[19:15] that was
[19:16] astonishing that is shocking God spoke
[19:20] to him about he and his wife God never
[19:24] told Sarah anything he said you're going
[19:26] to have a son and his name going to be
[19:28] Isaac isn't that right through this old
[19:30] woman named Sarah never had a child and
[19:33] pass child baring time and Abraham had
[19:36] to believe for himself and believe for
[19:38] his wife who God never spoke to who had
[19:42] Horrors and fight and mind battles and
[19:43] she have a right to have that because
[19:45] she never got a revelation the what
[19:47] Abraham had if she was in the spiritual
[19:50] and super spiritual not super religious
[19:52] Behavior she might have walk out in
[19:53] Abraham until you half crack but you see
[19:57] the fate of Abraham do make it act funny
[20:00] it make it act contrary to other people
[20:02] thinking it make a old man believe that
[20:05] his he's going to have a child it make a
[20:08] old man believe his old woman wife going
[20:09] to have a child and he staggered
[20:12] not act
[20:16] act when his back hurt him he was
[20:18] stacking a little bit when he had a hold
[20:20] the stick he was Rock a little bit that
[20:22] wasn't the problem he had a cough he had
[20:25] this he had pain he had fever that's not
[20:28] the problem
[20:29] but what God Said don't mess with that
[20:32] don't play with that what God Said don't
[20:35] deny that just say God said
[20:40] so come on let the Lord Give the Lord a
[20:42] shout don't fool with
[20:48] [Applause]
[20:52] that listen God took them out of Egypt
[20:56] that wasn't a problem feed them in the
[20:59] wilderness they complain that wasn't a
[21:01] problem they want meat they TIY light
[21:04] bread that's not a problem you send meat
[21:05] for them they want drink water from the
[21:08] rock whatever they want God struggle
[21:10] through with them because he know that's
[21:12] not the promise the journey is not the
[21:14] promise so all you fed up and you're
[21:17] tired you're on your journey but when
[21:19] they came to Kesh Bia and God trying to
[21:22] say but listen friends I'm about to show
[21:25] you what the Fulfillment is what the end
[21:29] game is don't doubt now I want to bring
[21:32] evidence back I want to send men spies
[21:36] to bring back evidence of a reality that
[21:39] this is more than quotes and books and
[21:41] tapes and scripture reading there is a
[21:43] land beyond the river there's a
[21:45] supernatural power there's a power to
[21:48] heal the sick to raise the dead to cast
[21:50] out Devils to speak in new tongues
[21:52] there's a power like you have never seen
[21:54] before that is coming to the church now
[21:58] Hallelujah I want you to believe in that
[22:00] power don't just come to church to sit a
[22:02] bench come to church to create an
[22:05] atmosphere to make a church that going

[22:19] glory to God glory to God
[22:22] GL hallelujah
[22:24] hallelujah to father my father my father
[22:28] yes verse six of that scripture and
[22:31] Joshua the son of
[22:32] none called the
[22:34] priests said unto them fine print take
[22:39] up the Ark of the
[22:40] Covenant let the seven priests bear
[22:42] seven trumpets of romes before the Ark
[22:45] of the Lord he said unto the people pass
[22:47] on come pass the city let him that is
[22:50] armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord
[22:53] and it came to pass when Joshua spoke
[22:55] unto the people seven priests bearing
[22:57] seven trumpets of horns passed on before
[23:00] the Lord and blew the trumpets and the
[23:02] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed
[23:04] them and the armed men went before the
[23:06] priest and blew the trumpets and reward
[23:08] came after the act the priest going on
[23:10] blowing the trumpets hear this part and
[23:13] Joshua had commanded the people saying
[23:15] you shall not shout hallelujah or make
[23:19] any noise with your voice neither shall
[23:21] any word proceed out of your mouth until
[23:24] the day I B you to shout then shall you
[23:27] shout so amidst the whole
[23:30] plan Joshua introduced
[23:33] a a time of
[23:38] Silence hallu silence does mean nothing
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:46] happening silent doesn't mean that there
[23:49] just nothing in effect no silence is
[23:52] waiting Hallelujah for the appointed
[23:55] time Hallelujah to
[23:57] execute God's plan and purpose so Joshua
[24:01] said when I bu it the shout then
[24:05] shout oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[24:12] Hallelujah praise the Lord praise God
[24:16] praise God and it came to pass on the
[24:19] seventh day when there Rose early about
[24:21] the dawn of the day and Compass the city
[24:24] seven times only on that day and the
[24:26] compass the city seven times came to the
[24:28] seven time when the police bought the
[24:30] trumpets Jus people shout for the Lord
[24:33] had given you the city hallu praise God
[24:36] that's before the city fall before the
[24:39] walls fell they had to shout because the
[24:42] Lord give the city you're not waiting

[24:47] to
[24:49] shout before your
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:57] walls
[25:01] H
[25:04] H that's
[25:05] faith when you could shout before your
[25:09] eyes pop open when you could shout
[25:11] before your part of your body
[25:12] get loosed when you could praise God
[25:16] hallelujah after 25 years believing God
[25:20] when you could give God a praise
[25:22] offering my God that like the devil say
[25:25] that you he is out of your hands now
[25:28] because you reconnect to the sense you
[25:31] had before the fall you see right now
[25:33] you you born in s you born in in sin and
[25:36] shape iniquity and connect to Five

[43:27] people lack Revelation know the Bible
[43:29] true and God is true and God is true but
[43:31] not
[43:32] Revelation but if you get Revelation a
[43:34] different thing like that look at Simeon
[43:37] old man it was revealed to him that he

[43:42] cancer come F canc

[45:36] [Applause]
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:47] up don't ever think your praise means
[45:50] nothing because when John begin to
[45:53] praise His prayer his praise was
[45:57] breaking
[45:58] Dimensions pray prayers praise is
[46:00] something else prayer is something else
[46:03] you know prayer can start on Earth and
[46:05] hit

[46:09] hit Heaven's Door but when God hears it
[46:12] he do hear it you know I've heard I've
[46:15] heard the people are desperate they
[46:18] really want a Revival they really want
[46:20] the Holy Ghost they really want the
[46:22] supernatural to break amongst
[46:25] them they for God I feel it this morning
[46:30] there's a thirst in the camp I love it
[46:33] any preacher going to love this I feel a
[46:36] deep calling to a deep I feel your
[46:38] groaning in spirit I feel your birth is
[46:41] about to come forth when Zion travailed
[46:45] Zion brought for Oh Glory to God is a
[46:48] travailing Zion there got to come as
[46:51] Trav in
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:53] [Music]
[46:55] s
[46:57] [Applause]
[46:58] you may be
[47:00] seated the world worried because they
[47:02] know what the D will
[47:04] do but that have nothing to do with what
[47:06] we had to do what he don't to do how to
[47:09] do but what the bride have to do the
[47:12] bride have to do oh we have some some
[47:14] heavy stuff this morning hallelujah
[47:17] praise God praise God hallelujah
[47:21] hallelujah and then he went further to
[47:23] say my as certain as I stand on the
[47:27] platform tonight I had the Revelation
[47:30] that will reveal of that seven seal it
[47:33] is in a three-fold manner and I will
[47:35] speak to you of an of a fold of it
[47:38] Hallelujah he said what happened is that
[47:40] those seven Thunders that he heard
[47:41] thunder and was forbidden to write
[47:44] what's the mystery laying those seven
[47:46] consecutive Thunders rolling
[47:48] out oh Hallelujah the mystery under the
[47:51] seven seil seven Thunders that the devil
[47:54] knows nothing about it was silent so he
[47:58] can't interpret it he have no revelation
[47:59] of it he don't understand it he can't
[48:01] connect with it so anytime I talk about
[48:03] Thunders he's totally
[48:05] confused his cabesa can't handle that
[48:08] his Spirit can handle that hallelujah
[48:11] praise God but the bride could handle
[48:13] that because that restores her image and
[48:16] the likeness of God back into her bride
[48:19] that is what make her a super race and a
[48:21] super church and a super people they're
[48:23] going to be amazed at the confidence
[48:24] that God put in your spirit amen in your
[48:27] heart but they're going to take note
[48:28] that you have been with Jesus because
[48:31] what Jesus did you'll be doing the same
[48:32] thing too these things Jesus began and
[48:35] continued to
[48:37] do Hallelujah if the first church wrote
[48:40] a book of Acts and next church can write
[48:45] books I will say it again if the first
[48:47] church wrote a book of Acts we can't be
[48:49] writing books and reading books we have
[48:52] to write another book of Acts

[49:19] off they want to write your off but God
[49:22] didn't write your off God put your name
[49:24] down in the book that's why the devil
[49:27] he's exposed this
[49:29] [Applause]

[49:38] to get sick and die don't accept that
[49:42] don't accept that let God sign you off

[50:27] kingdom to the people amen that we might
[50:31] be healed of our spirit and I believe
[50:34] that the body of Jesus is the sickest
[50:35] body I know of the spiritual body of
[50:38] Christ on Earth is very
[50:40] sick amen so here talk about physical
[50:42] healing but what about the healing of
[50:43] your soul of your mind of your past of
[50:46] your sins to be released from your guilt
[50:49] and you can't get out your own
[50:50] condemnation and can't condemn on the
[50:52] rot you were in how do you get out of it
[50:56] how do you P out of it you cry and see
[50:57] like God not hearing you you cry you
[50:59] call you pray and see like God is silent
[51:02] but God is Not silent as if he doing
[51:04] nothing I believe in my heart that his
[51:07] response has to do with your response
[51:11] amen isn't that right praise God that
[51:13] woman told herself if I could just Touch
[51:14] the Hem of His Garment I made whole she
[51:16] pressed her away and she was made whole
[51:18] isn't that right one time a baby Abraham
[51:21] was prayed that the baby was raised from
[51:23] the dead next woman she heard about that
[51:25] baby raised from the dead her baby was
[51:26] dead and she went to the convention she
[51:29] went to the meeting and she pressed her
[51:30] away she passed through leg she pushed
[51:31] she pushed she pushed and but bam tell
[51:34] somebody go down and pray for her she he
[51:36] doesn't know who she doesn't know who I
[51:37] am and eventually she pressed away so
[51:40] much her faith was
[51:42] pressing it's not just her physical body
[51:45] pressing her faith is what was pushing
[51:47] her her faith went up to heaven her
[51:50] faith break that dimension of time and
[51:54] went into that higher dimension Heaven
[51:57] dropped down a vision on brother
[51:58] brandham saw the baby smiling and that
[52:00] woman who was at the back had to come to
[52:02] the front he said bring that baby to
[52:04] me Hallelujah and the baby was raised
[52:07] from the dead why because Faith broke
[52:10] through and caught Heaven's attention
[52:14] you see Faith Heaven Must respond to
[52:17] Faith must it's compulsory Heaven cannot
[52:20] ignore Faith that's right faith is like
[52:22] racket in heaven Hallelujah faith is a
[52:25] heavy noise that interrupt what what

[54:14] Amen praise God so there's a vast
[54:17] difference between a Christian and a
[54:19] holy ghost fill Christian isn't that
[54:22] right the first place is a Christian
[54:24] profess to be a Christian but if this
[54:26] Christian has not yet been filled with
[54:27] the Holy Ghost he's only in the process
[54:30] of being a Christian he is professed to
[54:32] believe it he's working to it but God
[54:34] has not given him the spirit of the Holy
[54:36] Ghost he has not yet reached that goal
[54:38] with God that God recognize it and
[54:41] Abraham found Abraham was faithful to
[54:44] the promise that God gave him that he
[54:46] would have a child and God here we go
[54:49] confirm his faith by giving him a sign a
[54:52] sign of circumcision which is a type of
[54:55] the Holy Spirit he said you talk to
[54:59] me you let me talk to a Man 2 minutes I
[55:02] could tell you whether he received the
[55:03] Holy Ghost or not you so can you it
[55:07] separates them it's a Mark you are so
[55:10] different when the Holy Spirit comes on
[55:13] you until the mind of this world don't
[55:15] like you they against you they want
[55:17] nothing to do with you at all you are

[55:30] jungle you're 10 times more alien than
[55:33] that right you are different when the
[55:36] Holy Spirit comes it's a mark among the
[55:41] people so you are a

[1:26:00] butam said God knew that woman had more
[1:26:06] compassion than him to pray for that
[1:26:08] child so you he what God using that you
[1:26:11] could step into somebody's shoes and
[1:26:13] feel their pain and then effectively
[1:26:17] minister to them in prayer and spirit is
[1:26:20] not a mechanical thing it's a heart
[1:26:24] thing

[1:26:32] caught in
[1:26:34] adultery in the very
[1:26:36] act you know the shame and the
[1:26:39] embarrassment she must have felt by all
[1:26:41] these high priest looking men with all
[1:26:43] the long gong and whatnot and had the
[1:26:45] insights in and her was
[1:26:49] outside you know how Jesus was a felt
[1:26:51] dealing with that whole scenario he
[1:26:53] turned his back on and right in the sand
[1:26:56] he gave them chance to leave one by one
[1:26:57] he knew they would
[1:26:59] leave because he dropped the picture on
[1:27:01] them and the mirror and say look at all
[1:27:02] yourself take a peek if you like where
[1:27:05] you see all right belt all right the Big
[1:27:07] Stone when they look so they couldn't
[1:27:09] handle what they seeing was a mirror he

[1:27:14] yes sir and they couldn't handle it they
[1:27:16] walk away amen so you could understand
[1:27:18] now the compassion that Jesus dealt with
[1:27:20] to deal with that woman to tell a woman
[1:27:22] neither do I condemn go and sin no more

[1:27:27] out to the woman of the well you can
[1:27:30] understand how he go to Blind bimas you
[1:27:31] could understand and and it's
[1:27:33] interesting because a blind man come to

[1:27:37] to do for
[1:27:38] you and the man blind like a
[1:27:41] bat and you could see that but he still
[1:27:44] want it to come out your mouth what do

[1:28:17] Aon called and th him had 12 Stones and
[1:28:21] Isaac shared it with you all and anytime
[1:28:23] somebody a dream of vision they would
[1:28:25] bring it and speak it the stones would
[1:28:28] dormant dead nothing but when you speak
[1:28:30] it a supernatural light used to glow
[1:28:33] like a rainbow light to say that's God
[1:28:37] so that's how they knew the dream or the
[1:28:39] vision or the prophecy was of God Amen
[1:28:42] if somebody speak it and nothing
[1:28:45] happen thumbs down and that one so but
[1:28:49] saying here now if that supernatual
[1:28:51] light on a human T did not flash it was
[1:28:53] rejected because God was not in it I
[1:28:56] want you to hear listen any message
[1:29:01] regardless if it's from priest from
[1:29:03] preacher from Prophet or anything else
[1:29:05] any man no matter how spiritual what his
[1:29:09] office is what he has done if he raised
[1:29:13] the dead if he healed the sick if he's
[1:29:15] the AR Bishop of canary if he's the pope
[1:29:18] of Rome if he's the head of any
[1:29:20] denomination no matter how spiritual
[1:29:22] though he has spoke with tongues dance
[1:29:24] in the spirit though he preached the
[1:29:26] gospel no matter what he has done if his
[1:29:29] message doesn't come with the Bible it's
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:36] wrong this is God's human
[1:29:41] th
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:48] Hallelujah so the Aon priesthood is done
[1:29:51] away with but we still have a human T
[1:29:53] which is the Bible amen it have to flash
[1:29:55] isn't that right he told a
[1:29:59] dream okay whatever he saw the secret
[1:30:01] light okay skip that down praise the
[1:30:04] name of the
[1:30:10] Lord so it can't be one little quote
[1:30:12] here it had to be line upon line it has
[1:30:14] to be through the scriptures to bring
[1:30:16] out the whole picture isn't that right
[1:30:17] am oh my Hallelujah the Holy Ghost ought

[1:31:01] be to Jesus that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:31:04] supposed to mean to you isn't that right
[1:31:06] now Joshua to divide the land what if he
[1:31:08] like the tribe of God better than the
[1:31:10] Tribe of Benjamin tribe of Ephraim what
[1:31:13] if he like the tribe of Joseph better
[1:31:14] than Judah he didn't do it that way he
[1:31:17] divided it according to the word
[1:31:21] revealed by the spirit he divided it it
[1:31:24] according to tribe and notice he done it
[1:31:27] by Revelation by the discernment of
[1:31:29] God's spirit each one of those Hebrew
[1:31:32] mothers giving birth to those babies
[1:31:34] called their name and each one of their
[1:31:36] name had a meaning Jacob when he was
[1:31:38] born being a twin she called himself
[1:31:40] planter but when he got overcome in
[1:31:42] power his name was changed a prince
[1:31:44] isn't that right and when the the great
[1:31:47] thing each one of those Hebrew mothers
[1:31:49] in their travailing in child birth
[1:31:51] Hallelujah called their name out Reuben
[1:31:53] and plac him position in Palestine so
[1:31:56] the child birth the travil brought out
[1:31:59] the name as to place
[1:32:02] them and before we leave here you have
[1:32:04] to be placed so it will take some
[1:32:08] travail to positionally place
[1:32:13] you it will take more than just a amen
[1:32:16] it will literally take a

[1:46:05] those Mighty Men where are those
[1:46:07] Warriors of the faith when Daniel
[1:46:10] prophesied the people that know their
[1:46:12] God shall do great exploits not just
[1:46:15] read books and tapes not just being a
[1:46:18] message no great exploits her exploits
[1:46:22] of faith
[1:46:23] the six sense and
[1:46:27] demonstration come on now we not
[1:46:30] preaching word only we preaching there
[1:46:33] power and demonstration of the
[1:46:35] [Applause]
[1:46:37] Gospel what God is waiting for God is
[1:46:40] trying to place his church in position
[1:46:42] to manifest himself getting one he can
[1:46:45] work through and said there is my spirit
[1:46:49] flowing freely I can work here I can
[1:46:53] place him get another one maybe he could
[1:46:57] start maybe he could start here maybe he
[1:47:00] could start today that God can place one
[1:47:03] that God could say I could send my
[1:47:05] spirit my spirit can flow freely
[1:47:08] unhindered Channel no
[1:47:10] politics no sin no unbelief just a
[1:47:15] pipe the spirit can flow through
[1:47:21] Hall glory to God
[1:47:27] glory so whenever God Express himself by
[1:47:30] the word all the word listen if it's a
[1:47:33] hybrid the word gets short the spirit
[1:47:36] gets short circuited so the current can
[1:47:38] flow because some Creed or some Dogma go
[1:47:41] try to send any current and current
[1:47:43] can't go through blow the fuse but when
[1:47:47] the current is Flowing freely the word
[1:47:48] of God expresses itself that's why when
[1:47:51] the word becomes flesh the invisible
[1:47:54] becomes visible so don't tell me there
[1:47:57] is no God we had to say there is a lack
[1:47:59] of surrender to God because any man

[1:53:34] a true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:53:37] working within the framework of the
[1:53:38] Christian church and with God's spirit

[1:54:24] so they hold themselves in the upper
[1:54:26] room dry seeds Oh Glory to God and but
[1:54:29] even give a tremendous exaltation in
[1:54:31] preting on on on Thursday night praise
[1:54:35] God and I want to bring some little
[1:54:36] quotes from what he shared here no one
[1:54:38] can look at what they see and be a
[1:54:41] Christian no one can look at what they
[1:54:44] see and be a Christian you have got to
[1:54:46] believe the things that are unseen by
[1:54:49] faith you are healed not by sight not
[1:54:52] not by feelings the Supernatural is what
[1:54:55] you do not see but what you believe and
[1:54:58] act on through that we become so
[1:55:01] conscious of looking at one another like
[1:55:02] this but there's an Unseen World greater
[1:55:05] than anything you can see the Unseen
[1:55:08] World is is more real than this world
[1:55:11] because the world that came came from
[1:55:12] things that do not
[1:55:14] appear
[1:55:17] Amen in other words the seen World a
[1:55:19] person had cancer tumor a person dying
[1:55:22] but he seen world so that person
[1:55:24] healed so the Unseen World is greater
[1:55:26] than this world and when you pull from
[1:55:28] The Unseen World and bring it to this
[1:55:30] world eyes pop open deaf air pop open
[1:55:33] dumb begin to speak because this Unseen
[1:55:36] World is more real than this world
[1:55:38] because this Unseen World could create a
[1:55:40] new
[1:55:43] world oh my oh my didn't mean to keep it
[1:55:47] this long but listen to this in this
[1:55:48] world man is contining getting
[1:55:51] worse choosing rather to walk by sight
[1:55:53] instead of by faith then when he does he
[1:55:56] robs the inner man which is the soul the
[1:55:59] Eternal part of man in this world in
[1:56:01] this building there are evil spirits and
[1:56:03] War and Christians anointed and the
[1:56:06] angels of God encamp around them to
[1:56:09] energize them with faith and here I am
[1:56:12] standing here yaling myself and the Holy
[1:56:15] Spirit is moving this is what you call
[1:56:18] Heavenly
[1:56:19] places so when you come to church you
[1:56:22] come to be
[1:56:24] energized when you praise somebody
[1:56:27] behind you not praising God your
[1:56:28] anointing start to sweep and and be all
[1:56:31] around
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:34] them the whole armor of God is
[1:56:36] Supernatural love joy peace
[1:56:39] longsuffering gentleness meekness and
[1:56:41] the Holy Ghost all of that is
[1:56:43] unseen life Faith joy peace all of that
[1:56:46] is unseen every armor of the believer is
[1:56:49] looking at the Unseen the whole armor of
[1:56:51] God is Supernatural if if you look at
[1:56:52] your hand if you look at your
[1:56:54] tumor it will remain that way look away
[1:56:56] from that and look to the promise of God
[1:56:59] Daniel was looking to the Unseen when he
[1:57:01] went to the Lion's de the two HEB boys
[1:57:03] was going unseen when the fireing
[1:57:05] furnace if you watch your firey furnace
[1:57:07] you go ball oh God but when you look at
[1:57:09] the Unseen you say my God if my god do
[1:57:12] deliver I'm still not going to bow down
[1:57:14] I'm going to go as long as God is
[1:57:16] leading I'm going to go he going to lead
[1:57:18] me up the mountain he going to lead me
[1:57:19] down the valley he going to lead me over
[1:57:21] the hill wherever he going to go he's
[1:57:23] going to lead me isn't that right oh
[1:57:25] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:57:29] six sense that sense of faith is what
[1:57:31] made the red SE push back that six sense
[1:57:33] raised the dead by the six sense Mighty
[1:57:36] Miracles that be performed it's the most
[1:57:37] powerful force on Earth your fifth sense
[1:57:40] lays within your brain but your six
[1:57:42] sense lays in your heart your five
[1:57:44] senses lays in your brains but this six
[1:57:47] Sense come on give the Lord a shout
[1:57:49] you're almost done that six sense lays
[1:57:51] inside your
[1:57:53] guard your
[1:57:54] heart guard your
[1:57:56] heart guard your heart don't let no
[1:58:00] bitterness don't let no envy and evil
[1:58:01] guard your heart because there is where
[1:58:04] that six sense got to
[1:58:07] thunder oh
[1:58:09] Hallelujah glory to God because of the
[1:58:13] six sense the lands could need Daniel
[1:58:15] they couldn't get near him because that
[1:58:17] six sense was a super sense that same
[1:58:19] six sense the Tre boys was thrown a
[1:58:20] fiery furnace and all reasoning could
[1:58:23] have proven that we be burned to death
[1:58:24] but that six cense stayed for 2 three
[1:58:26] hours it's that same six cense that have
[1:58:29] a Peter Paul laying in jail and they're
[1:58:31] going to behead him next day but down in
[1:58:32] Mark's house they had a prayer meeting
[1:58:35] and the six sense here we go begin to
[1:58:37] accumulate around the jail where he was
[1:58:39] covered by prayer it was the prayers of
[1:58:41] the Saints loosen the six sense and they
[1:58:44] creat an atmosphere around the prison
[1:58:46] they want to cut off brother Peter head
[1:58:47] next day but the six sense of Faith bust
[1:58:50] that prison open and loose Peter from
[1:58:52] that prison and the devil want to cut
[1:58:54] off your head but today we come to
[1:58:56] guarantee you and with the prayers of
[1:58:58] the Saints praise God to raise you out
[1:59:01] of that atmosphere that you're in Oh
[1:59:03] Glory to God it was the six sense that
[1:59:06] raised Jesus from the dead after he laid
[1:59:08] in the ground he belied the word of God
[1:59:09] destroyed his body in three days I will
[1:59:11] raise it up but he is going down but I
[1:59:13] will raise it up because the sixense was
[1:59:15] built in oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:59:18] people
[1:59:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:23] Hallelujah and the prophet said the six
[1:59:25] sense oh God pour it out on me give it
[1:59:28] to me give it to everyone who needs it
[1:59:31] Pour thy six sense into me
[1:59:33] [Applause]
[1:59:37] Lord Oh Glory to God
[1:59:42] hallelujah I think that no church in
[1:59:44] this practice no matter how intellectual
[1:59:46] and fundamental it might be that church
[1:59:48] cannot strive until the Supernatural is
[1:59:51] made known among the people and they see
[1:59:54] it amen just a four two more quotes and
[1:59:56] we close Hallelujah Hallelujah from a
[1:59:58] true sign Overlook under T you man many
[2:00:01] wonders why would would those things be
[2:00:04] necessary for a man to go through it's
[2:00:06] because talking about the prophets is
[2:00:08] because people won't read the word and
[2:00:09] they won't pray so God is Sovereign he
[2:00:12] sends his Prophet to be a sign the
[2:00:14] people won't read they don't care to
[2:00:15] read they won't pray because they have
[2:00:17] other things to do they can't take time
[2:00:19] to pray and the Bible is boresome to
[2:00:21] them hasn't got enough action for them
[2:00:22] these days God here we go want his
[2:00:24] people to pray and when Israel got so
[2:00:27] taxed in such a condition that they
[2:00:28] could not go any further they time was
[2:00:30] fulfilled and their burden lay further
[2:00:32] than they thought they begin to pray and
[2:00:35] when the people begin to pray then God
[2:00:37] begins to hear hallu it was time for the
[2:00:40] word of God to be fulfilled and amam and
[2:00:42] Yoshi bed saw it was time for God to be
[2:00:45] word to be fulfill they went to pray to
[2:00:47] God and usually those who pray is the
[2:00:50] one who gots the burden and the one who
[2:00:51] gets something is who pray that's ordain
[2:00:54] of God to do so watch let them all break
[2:00:57] down the Prejudice and say we'll all
[2:00:58] forget our CES and cism everything else
[2:01:01] isn't it strange that God wants the
[2:01:02] people to have a part into
[2:01:05] it the prayers of the Saints Hallelujah
[2:01:08] isn't it strange here why when Jesus
[2:01:10] looked up to the Harvest he said the
[2:01:11] Harvest is right the laborers are few
[2:01:13] you pray the Lord of the Harvest that's
[2:01:16] what him you pray to me that I will send
[2:01:18] laborers into the Harvest it is some
[2:01:20] part you have to do God God here we go
[2:01:23] are you ready church is everybody up and
[2:01:25] Alive God is waiting for his church to
[2:01:29] call on
[2:01:33] him everybody didn't hear that because
[2:01:36] didn't hear thing I get 100% amen God is
[2:01:39] waiting on his church to call on him he
[2:01:42] always did it God is waiting today for
[2:01:46] the people to call his servants into
[2:01:49] action the servant can't get into action
[2:01:53] until the people
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:57] [Applause]
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:01] pray I'm not hearing
[2:02:03] you I'm not hearing you do you want the
[2:02:07] church do you want the servant of God to
[2:02:09] come into action then you have to have
[2:02:11] the prayers of the Saints and there's a
[2:02:14] vile there's a container to hold your
[2:02:17] prayer it's like incense unto God Amen
