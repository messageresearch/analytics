presence Among Us are we thank you for the blood that speak better things Lord and we thank you that you have shed your blood to give us an entrance so we could enter in and be pardoned and be cleansed from our sins and our unbelief but God made you a special work today among your people among your sons and daughters and especially among the young people father that you'd visit them with your presence and visit them with Deliverance visit them with your Greece help them but there's so much more time stressful for the young people than 20 years ago or 30 years ago you have been so much harder and so much challenges that lead before them but I pray that you would come Lord in a special ring and deep with our hearts and our lives we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you and welcome even if the Bibles have one portion of scripture from Luke chapter 15. we want to read from verse 17 to 19. today Luke chapter 15 thank you sister Genevieve for that special thank you all for coming out here this morning we certainly appreciate that Luke chapter 15 reading from verse 17 and this is just a portion we're going to get to the whole thing of The Prodigal Son but this is just what he was saying I don't want to take something from there for 17. and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my father have bread enough and despair and I perish with hunger I will arise and go to my father and we'll see unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of our sins may God bless his word you may be seated God bless you good to see you brother Daniel praise God welcome back praise God Amen praise the Lord amen Hallelujah uh God bless you and I trust in that you're doing fine I trust them you had an exciting week a challenging week everyone's challenging that's great because God is the god of challenges and we want to prove himself to you amen so we look forward to see what the Lord will do for us we had a great time in the power of prayer yesterday we are really grateful for the turnout and for you being here to cry out unto God and I trust then that you if you'd have heard it I want to go and listen back to the message on Wednesday night thus said the Lord of hosts consider your ways it's a very key message is a very important message consider this so let's begin this morning I have a title and when he came to himself that's the title when he came to himself and I have an inspiration return time to come back home that's the inspiration return time to come back home now when Leviticus the 25th chapter 1910 verse and this is God speaks then shall thou call The Trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall he make the trumpeter song throughout all your land you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man to his possession and shall return every man to his family so God by presenting the word you know sometimes your Fallen debt in those days and you fall into slavery but God had a provision of Grace shout out Grace this morning that Grace make a provision for a jubilee Trumpeter song you didn't have to do anything you know you're there you go in you're laboring you're under pressure you're under stress but when that trumpet song and you receive that trumpet sound you have the Liberty to return to go back to your family to go back to your possession if they take it for 50 years you have to go back to it 40 years 20 years you went back this is the law of God nobody can change that God ordained that in other words you can't pay back what you owe but God provided this Jubilee here as a means of Grace for his people to get back where they belong and what they had when they were lost oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah praise God praise God praise God be believe that so if an individual lost the inheritance that was given to them by God there came a Year of Jubilee and every seven years that arrest a Sabbath every seven years had a Sabbath and seven years they had a Sabbath and seven Sabbath was 49 years and the 50th year was a jubilee so if it was caught in slavery and you're young and you get old you was 10 and I was 50 years 60 you could go back with your stick if you have a stick but you're going back to inheritance you're going back to your family and no devil could stop that no powers could stop that because that is the law that God set up oh give the Lord some Praises oh hallelujah praise God and in this Jubilee every man that has lost his inheritance if he was a Freeborn or true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing no price without money without price you have to pay nothing nothing to that safe Master because you're smoking and drinking nothing nothing at all you don't owe him nothing you have the freedom to go back as a son or daughter of the Living God as if you never did it as if it never backflated as if it never was lost as if you never fell away a jubilee Oh Glory to God Amen praise God he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance stop what you're doing what Jesus told a woman woman go and sin no more or give the Lord some Praises this morning oh I feel the fire in the building this morning prayers they should never shout you could shout this morning because God gonna give you a jubilee God gonna give you a release oh praise the name of the Lord let's go he had a right to it it was his god-given right because he by Grace inherited it it would have been given to the fathers handed on year after year no matter what if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is the way provided for each individual to return to the rightful inheritance we're going to get down to that Prodigal Son because the Prodigal Son asked the father for his portion when the father releases to the son it was no longer the father's own you know it was the son's own he said give me my portion give me my inheritance what did Caleb say give me my mountain you have to come to a spot where you want your portion I'm not hearing you where you want your inheritance okay the Lord some Praises if your father leave inheritance to you that is yours that is yours if you don't get that this morning I'm saying it to you that is yours no man have a right to hinder you from possessing your god-given inheritance that's what Jesus died for that's what she has made a price for oh my God so matter what's taking place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is the way provided for each individual to return to the rightful inheritance what a picture it gave us tonight of the church in this last days you see what man can do then you see what God does What man does is feeling will feel on us feel always feel but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it it's his free gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there is nothing can ever move it it's there eternally there we go and the Jubilee actually was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to the rightful position we need to go back to the power of God although in numbers persecution's always shrinking the church so when God light fire under your feet or under your seat it's good don't say Amen it's still good whether I like it they don't like it they're still good persecution always threatened the church we have had it too easy amen we get Slot full we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is just handed to us now we have a bunch of young people now under the spirit of entitlement they feel somebody owe them this one open Society with them the parents told them this one over them he's a Christian curse of entitlement we get thoughtful we get to a place where we don't want to move on because we everything is just handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit I want everybody to say Amen to that because that applies that each and every one of us and I will say it again in case you miss any of these words [Music] it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and these things Don't Preach from Moana you just need some man man of God and he in tears here he ain't going nowhere going to the tribulation with all these bunch of ministers who are pumping this thing to tell the characters or the gift is a victory too blessed to be stressed you ain't got enough stress yet to be blessed every son that cometh to God must be tried must be tested this road and this park we are on is not going to get easier Shake Yourself [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey guy I told them Wednesday night Dusty had a lot of hosts consider your ways you're taking care of your business but you're not seeing what mines you know if you see what God's business praise the Lord Hallelujah if you see what God's business [Applause] you say you got wages and I put a hole in your pocket the money's potential you have nothing to show with all the money pass through you God did that he said I shot the heavens praise God I cause famine High cause takes not to work out for you because you have no burden for the house of God you have the burden for the things of God he has no point for refiner he has no burden for the fire to come into the church there's not a lecture there's not Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall with preaching the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is preached and every man prays foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] let them come unto me and drink not if any man feels a drink you know if any man tests or cloterson is different when test when you're thirsty you've got to drink something [Applause] foreign buy some water then I drink whole bottle one time why I wasn't even if I drink I was tasty you see me you know I I see for that no no he ain't talking to you If any man tests let him come here we go there's a bomb here now it takes sorrow tears sweat prayer fate promise to move forward in Paul's spirit that zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanish from our assemblies you talking about that time when them sisters on fire they come with some Buckshot guns and shoot at them and the bullets fell off the clothes the anointing of God upon them sisters praising and worshiping God those scissors was Bulletproof and he said if I'm afraid of the windows would be shut out at night people run everywhere and never come back again when we get everything so easy we just slip along and the first thing you know we have gone out of these things and losing our inheritance oh my so now a man and his family could go back to the original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee trumpet song and know what it meant to them if they heard the priests on the trumpet the minister the trumpet is the gospel and when they hear it and they know what it means they know that the inheritance no matter where they lost no matter how far went or fall back they had a privilege to come and receive it again The Inheritance the whole family could come and receive it tonight oh my soul listen praise remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go that's all he had to do go back if he knew the song of the trumpet he knew that the song on the trumpet see for there was for sons of God now Jesus ate Saint John eat it if I said the son abide forever now a servant does not abide a servant does not abide remember he's a son not a servant he's a son because he's born a son he didn't join he's born a son Oh Glory to God do you believe that praise God praise God praise God so all the Slackers and lazy people listen to this one time I ain't called No Name but who'd have kept fit after just keep keep wearing it I've noticed how the Holy Spirit do you know there is some things that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it did you know we are the branches and he's the Vine but Divine cut their fruit it's the branches that bear fruit are you ready he finishes the energy but we got to do the job [Music] that is by no Angela coming along to sweep your house No Angel come under the washing your car that's you have to do that okay the Lord some Praises God is not going to do what you could do or give the Lord some Praises I want to hear a shout rock with me tonight rock with me this morning [Music] so God gives the energy but you do you do the work work is what you have to do the work is what we have to do but he said go into all the world and work preach the gospel Oh Glory he that believeth is baptized shall be saved Oh Glory to God we have to go there and work not sit down and and warm up your bench work don't say Amen Hallelujah behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work [Applause] [Music] if you want to get reward you better start start this morning do something for the kingdom sing for the kingdom whistle for the kingdom preach for the kingdom give it a tape a book for the kingdom testify for the kingdom give witness for the kingdom the kingdom is being preached this morning give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah let's continue what we talk about we are talking about demons in the spiritual form in the soul they are in the soul the same ad as they are in the body even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease it's an honorary mention it's demonology here we go every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it so the beginning of every disease and sickness is a spirit Spirit stripping started breakup cells they get a tumor then more cells break and spread and spread and spread the preacher come and curse the spirit out of that body you get healed doctors tried to cut the whole thing out with the spirit in it you get healed too but it stopped in the fourth dimension we live in three dimensions but there's a four dimension x-ray prove that television proved that putting a TV screen here no one putting on you still see pictures but nobody is standing inside the TV is light something passing that you cannot see that they're picking up that is showing to you well that same way principle God could praise God to a reflector in tight God could drop down his thoughts and his words and speak directly to you from that next dimension that your knees could be met and your prayer could be answered and you can hear direct from God this morning [Music] [Applause] regardless of what I want to speak God can speak directly to you [Applause] let's continue no cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come and eat a place there are many times many peoples with good thoughts good people who try to rest upon some theology and they have been taught since a child and still find the dung and their being done in their soul that they still have something that's not right many of you here this morning no doubt whenever you find Christians gathered together you find people who have those Spirits in them it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if I could just quit lying if I could only quit lusting if I only quit this dark no that is devils and they come in the form of religion many times let's continue someone said the other day brother Branham do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing I know we read this many times and hope this ring to you special this morning someone asked the other day brother do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing I said what are you questioning about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all there just stay with that when you start to do anything if there's a question what is right or wrong stay away from it whether it's the bedroom whether it's the drawing room where it is the kitchen where it is wherever don't do it once there is a question could we give the Lord some praises don't do it at all then you know you are right I am positive sure this morning if men and women can only get you to the position to where their soul and their thinking and their attitudes will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed something transform your thinking transform your attitudes the people inside of here have different thoughts they have different needs they have different challenges and a word have to come to you now the world have to come from God the minister to all these different needs here I am not the supplier he's a supplier I am not the source he is the source I am not the father he is the father oh God he is one who spoke his word and know exactly how we set you how we call you what your challenges are what your need is what you need this morning he know what you have needed Oh Glory to God and some point in time you have to come to yourself you have to say I have to stop this stupidness this thing cannot continue I have to change my work I have to change my talk I have to change my operation [Applause] therefore if a man and woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so line up with God until the channel of the holy spirit will be so perfectly one with God what will take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up where the freedom from the hearts would fade from the animals Freedom From The Heart yes you need to ask somebody a question and they had to think in mind how to answer you know Freedom there you know nice mental gymnastics going on Saturday because you don't want to see it so you see it's so take it so how many tickets when there's freedom is freedom Jesus wasn't asked questions because they wanted answers they were asking us questions to trap him that way they asked should we pay taxes to Caesar they may want to answer that you know it's the truck that's trying to trap him they're not trying for edification the question asked Jesus was to trap him oh give the Lord a shout there are questions they could ask when this open asks if what did God say it's not because they want to be edified Lucifer wasn't like a verification looking to be blessed by the word from God he wanted to know what the woman know that he could get a wrong that the twist his word the word what he's gonna say so God I tell you so God not talking to you you better go and check God you know he is but she said God said we could eat of all the trees but if you'd have missed the garden we shall not eat before the day eat you shall not surely die and it's a person that will go tell you oh gosh that is God's word you know but you you shall not surely die God only impose that if you only eat that tree your eyes shall be open your understanding shall be open these are the people right now there are plenty understanding open knowledge shall increase they have too much of knowledge now by that Artificial Intelligence coming on top of that now this is lunacy but this is it now and all God wants us to do is to believe his word receive his word isn't that right so watch many people come up to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual fate they confess their sins join a church intellectual Faith they believe it in their heart their mind they believe it because they hate it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that is not what God's looking for so we can have ten thousand people that are here but what kind of fit is in those ten thousand let's let's back up here now he didn't look at your intellectual fate he looks on the heart where on the inside when it comes from the heart all things are possible then oh do you believe that give me a preacher are you ready you want to get the keynote give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer a factory worker that will put God first in everything I will show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him I want to hear a bigger name than that this is God telling you that you are going to be successful if you prepare to put God first in everything or give the Lord some praises he seeks God's first we get in somewhere so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God spirits that in the world they are demons and they go in places and they get among men ministers yes entice in spirits they get among church members that is true but over it yes they get amongst good people I don't want bad people you know good church people good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that is contrary to the word of God Say Amen you're saying Amen to the word I'm not trying to present what I'm thinking I'm feeling this is prophetic utterance so one of intellectual Faith the other is a direct revelation of God David danced before the Lord his wife laughed at him God looking from heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart his mother was right his life was right behind it so just because we can be emotional don't mean we are saved because we go to church don't mean we are saying don't believe those enticing Spirits a real spirit of God a real word of God is the truth of God which is the seed of God produce God in your life to be Godly and to be holy and simply among a lot of people we find that we're emotions and so forth become stackless and backbitings and

God deceive deceived within and without he deceived without my Delilah but he's deceived within that he's at a lie and feel that was all right as long as he's going to reveal the strength the source of his strength he started to play games because he knew he was gifted Hallelujah but he playing games but he's gifted he is playing games he know God is with him he's playing game because you know you have them Seven Locks that keeps the Covenant with God but that devil behind the Lila person and he understands a war going on because he pressing him and pressing him to find out a secret now if the devil see you as strong and you're pressing on you think the devil will say and make a special and sing about you that you are strong and pressing on no he won't inspire you out he want to see a secret you want to know why you're praising him in the good times and while you praise him in the bad times and when things don't you're still praising them I went things up you're still praising him

you are blind because being deceived beings they think you're right and you're wrong Adam was not deceived he was she actually thought she was right Adam knew he was wrong so when Delilah strength they say you love me you say every time you read chords and things I will be weak like a dead Normal Man no he know if that anointing come up for him he like normally that power for granted you took that fine entitlement and when she was Samson the Philistine is a pondy the man no he calling for Philistines it's not something we have a case we have we have some bananas and some apples outside for use for the it's still his times they jump on him after you get time records and he pass it that like a joke but she pleaded until he talked about his here and if I caught I got to lose it and she cut off his hair and the Bible says something to shake himself like before came to himself only to realize the power it's not dear he came to realize he's just like everybody else what for God God for the Covenant Give the Lord a shout when Samson came to himself he was weak and the penalty of breaking God's word sent him in the dungeon with his eyes dug out oh praise God under judgment for years but while Samson was in prison another shock of hair was growing out while Samson was in prison he saw a possibility so even in prison as a son [Applause] even in prison as a son even in the bar in the rum shop wherever as a son you can see a possibility Oh Glory to God get the Lord some Praises do you see a possibility this morning to return to power to return to inheritance to return to give God glory to return to the honor and glory of God do you see a possibility [Applause] Hallelujah something you know the story you say lead me to the Post a little boy leading him now all the time he's doing his own thing as a department of young people when we like to do our own thing you can get blinded doing your own thing you know you could get in prison doing your own thing no a little boy is listening lead me to the pillars and then Samson put his day as hands between the pillars and say once more I pray God once more Lord let me die with the Philistines is dead than in his life he brought honor and Glory to God Hallelujah glory to God enticing spirits rejected and the prophet prophesied God sendeth another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstration of the spirit not just talk and talk on Bible talk and the demonstration of the spirit that acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 all of it will be following right along with the

to your system that will grow our spiritual power back into your life again oh glory to God glory to God so now we're coming on to our scripture now Luke 15. on the Book of Luke there are three parables this book that we talk about this prodigal son the three Parables very interesting three Parables that is dear the first Parable is that of the lost sheep the second Parable is that of the Lost coin the third Parable we call it that of the lost son let's look at the first Parable before we get down to our last one the first part of the lost sheep that's Luke 15. one to seven then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees in Christ remember saying this man receiveth sinners and eat it with them so we have a mark against This Man Called Jesus because he's a he's sitting with Sinners and he eats him with them and he speak this Parable unto them sin no powers are truths in the form of stories so Jesus has given him a story he said what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them dot not leave the 90 and 9 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until you find it and and when he found it he laid it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he come at home he called her together his friends and neighbors seen unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repented more than 90 and 90 just prisons which need no repentance that's the first Parable that Jesus gave Hallelujah note the first parable the story of the Lost has solely to do with the shepherd the Sheep is not the important part here is the burden is for the shepherd the Sheep couldn't do anything the shepherd or the true Shepherd was willing to leave the 99. and here it is in the wilderness foreign to go after that which is lost until until then until until when until he finds it now it's not easy to be left in the wilderness and you can't see the shepherd people say where is Shepherd boy like things things different wrong I ain't seen this Shepherd he said they were left in the wilderness what kind of Shepherd is that in addition to not seeing the shepherd them to see the shepherd coming back with this strange sheep or this sheep that has gone the street to see the Sheep get in our shoulder right you can imagine us saying I never get a I never get Schuler right I hear long time in church and I never see the shepherd put me on your shoulder that won't go that's three and now he's getting our shoulder right isn't that something again this is solely the work of the shepherd returning the Sheep back to the fold the Sheep returned it was always a sheep it was never a goat once a sheep always a sheep once a son always the son give the Lord some praises Hallelujah [Applause] let's continue in addition the shepherd called Neighbors and friends to rejoice sheep lost sheep phone sheep returned then rejoicing that's the pattern sheep lost she found sheep returned then let us rejoice or give the Lord some praises then he said I say unto you likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sin ever repented that over 99 just persons which need no repentance or give the Lord some praises you love him this morning Hallelujah let's go to the second parable this is the part note all this is in one chapter you know 15. I don't even get the last thing is going to be the Prodigal Son so the first one we get it it was the shepherd dependent find that cheap find leave 90 and 9 and seek until you bring that cheap back home this one is very unique Jesus speaks either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece dot not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently did you find it and when she had found it she called her friends and enable us to get us in Rejoice with me if I have found the peace which I had lost likewise I sent to you there is joy in the presence of angels of God over one sinner that repented note this second Parable was placed in the second coming of the Lord the Lost coin in the parable the owners or the burden or the weight or the responsibility is on the woman to find a coin Hallelujah the coin have to be returned to its place if she didn't find it she was taking them between as a prostitute because in those days the banner around the head had the different coins in it representing certain virtues that she had was to be connected with her husband was coming back and I said the Lord she is coming back and you have to have all the coins to be part of this bright thing some praises the coin can't come to the woman she had to find it she had to clean everything she has to keep cleaning up until she found what was lost oh come on church do you see it now the responsibility in the first one was the shepherd the responsibility of the second one is the woman she have to find diligently until she found what was lost and then she called her neighbors and Friends rejoice Rejoice Rejoice with me I lost it but I found it I lost it but I got it back I lost it but there's no return I wanted a party with me I wanted to shout with me I wanted to Rejoice with me oh give the Lord some praises oh Hallelujah praise God praise God the prophet and the message that he prayed this scripture here second of the Lord he says later on we think we don't come to church to occupy a pew we don't come to church I hear a good sermon or competition here good music they all got their place where we come to church to do is to check up our soul salvation for the dear Redemption is near if the woman was married she should wear a wedding ring today as a sign she's married to keep other men offer isn't that right endorses didn't have a wing they had a coin a coin some coins around the head a banner a headband it's not the first virtue was a laughter husband second was a pledge to vote you to live clean for him two at fourth fifth sixth seventh and tenth you look for it Galatians 5 isn't that right long suffering joy peace all these virtues is the tablet supposed to be in the church and he said no if there ever was a time that is just ought to take inventory to find out if you've got all those coins on and I was consider your ways not considered a wife whiz somebody here considering Wheels they're looking at the right ways they're looking at

serve you transgress I at any time take Commandments and yet don't never give us me a kid that I might make Merry with my friends but as soon as thy son was come here right now he disconnected himself from this brother thing you know as soon as thy son has come with her devour thy living with highlights that was killed for him the fatty God and this brought any messages he said unto him look how this guy was lacking revelation he's angry he's upset with his brother he has an attitude to his brother and is a shame that God could bless people to get back to the hopes of God and people of
