[29:17] word of
[29:19] prayer and I want to read a prayer from
[29:21] God's prophet in the message having
[29:24] conferences you can keep playing
[29:27] [Music]
[29:29] every head bowed every eyes closed but
[29:32] the random was praying and I want this
[29:34] to be our prayer this morning our most
[29:37] gracious and loving father the God of
[29:39] all life that sent to us thy loving son
[29:43] the Lord Jesus that he might be the
[29:46] appropriation for our sins took upon
[29:49] himself the form of sinful flesh and was
[29:53] made sin for us that we unworthy people
[29:57] might might be drawn nigh unto God
[30:00] through the shedding of his blood once
[30:02] and for
[30:03] all and we have gathered here in this
[30:06] conference Lord in these
[30:08] nights just to be seen not just to be
[30:11] seen of others or to so much as
[30:14] associate with each other Lord we pray
[30:17] that if that has been the attitude of
[30:19] the people up to this time and myself
[30:21] that you will forgive us for our
[30:23] sin we have come Lord in the age of the
[30:26] dying we come in the time that when we
[30:29] feel we don't have much time left and we
[30:32] have gathered here for one purpose and
[30:34] that's to get close to you we want our
[30:37] sins under the blood we want close
[30:40] Fellowship we want to talk it over with
[30:42] you Lord before you come for on that day
[30:46] it'll be too late then and we pray today
[30:49] Father God that you'll put such a hunger
[30:51] in the heart of the people until up and
[30:54] down these river banks will be prayer
[30:56] meetings going going on men seeking God
[30:59] In A desperate condition knowing that
[31:02] they must find rest to their souls and
[31:05] receive the Holy Spirit or here they'll
[31:07] pun someday into eternity without
[31:10] knowing you oh God be merciful to us and
[31:13] as we see our churches and our own full
[31:16] gospel groups begin to cool down and
[31:18] seem like there's no great crying for
[31:20] lost souls there's no more of that
[31:23] sincere all night prayer and meditation
[31:26] in the word and it seems like we have
[31:28] just drifted Lord forgive us oh God and
[31:31] let us renew ourselves today a fresh in
[31:33] the Holy
[31:35] Spirit when we can think of the days
[31:37] going by in the age of the Methodist
[31:39] when they prayed all night long and wept
[31:41] with bitter tears for the lost and they
[31:43] have no peace and today seems like we
[31:46] can just dress nice and sit down and
[31:48] listen and go home unconcerned oh Lord
[31:51] stir our hearts today put a Zeal in our
[31:54] souls for lost souls May min ministers
[31:57] and the Ley every person become a part
[32:00] of the Kingdom with a burning desire
[32:02] that we canvas cities and everywhere and
[32:05] pull the loss out of the gutters and get
[32:07] them as fire brands for the Lord we read
[32:11] over in the book that it is said that
[32:13] the angel went forth and put a mark upon
[32:15] those who sighed and cried for the
[32:17] Abomination that was did in the city and
[32:20] realizing by the scriptures that there
[32:22] was the first coming of the Holy Spirit
[32:24] through the city of Jerusalem then on
[32:27] his second return in this age to call a
[32:29] people out of the Gentiles for his name
[32:33] how much more should we be concerned and
[32:37] sighing and crying for the Abominations
[32:39] that did we see churches practicing rock
[32:42] and roll and playing Bingo and having
[32:44] all kinds of swimming contests and so
[32:47] forth in the church when prayer meetings
[32:48] and all night taring meetings is
[32:50] forgotten God send us back to the real
[32:54] thing send us back to the real thing let
[32:57] the Holy Ghost come among these people
[32:59] today and start a Pentecost right here
[33:02] granted Lord in every heart truly they
[33:05] want to it's in their hearts to do it
[33:07] but the cares of the world and the
[33:09] swiftness of passing of time has just
[33:12] woed them out Lord start from this

[34:51] amen before the every place you put your
[34:54] foot is yours right worship
[34:58] because worship is your way of letting
[35:00] God know that he is your god it has
[35:03] nothing to do with how bad this week was
[35:06] it has nothing to do with what happened
[35:09] this morning it has nothing to do with
[35:11] if you could pay your bills it has
[35:13] nothing to do with what the condition of
[35:16] your mortgage is it doesn't it have
[35:18] nothing to do with what the doctor said
[35:20] about you it it doesn't even have
[35:22] anything to do but your past or your
[35:25] mistakes or your failures we are talking
[35:27] about worship because he is God before
[35:30] you get the Holy Ghost you have to
[35:32] worship before you get a blessing you
[35:35] have to worship before God can touch
[35:37] your child you have to worship before
[35:40] the sickness can leave your body you
[35:42] have to worship before you can get your
[35:44] breakthrough you have to
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] worship before you pray
[35:51] worship that's why that's the way Jesus
[35:53] taught us you may be seated he said let
[35:57] me teach you how to pray come on and he
[36:00] started our father with Arch in heaven
[36:04] hallow it be thy name before he asked
[36:07] for anything he he was
[36:09] worshiped acknowledging that God is
[36:11] above and he is powerful Our Father who
[36:14] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[36:17] kingdom come thy he didn't ask for
[36:20] anything yet thy will be done on Earth
[36:23] as it is in
[36:24] heaven you are God
[36:27] there is none like you there is no God
[36:30] like Jehovah he is bigger than your
[36:33] problem he is bigger than your trial he
[36:36] is bigger than your
[36:39] situation hallah
[36:42] hallelujah
[36:45] hallelujah he may be
[36:48] seated many religions my God in the
[36:52] world have God for different days and
[36:54] God for different events and the god of
[36:57] rain and the god of animals and the god
[36:59] of Health some of us are guilty because
[37:03] we have made our God the god of Sunday
[37:06] Jesus
[37:08] hallelujah it's only on Sunday we
[37:10] worship my God it's only when we come to
[37:13] church we worship Hallelujah but worship
[37:16] it should be natural to you as
[37:19] breathing because we were created to
[37:22] worship if you miss worship you miss the
[37:24] very purpose for your existence
[37:27] that's why brother Bram said if there's
[37:28] no noise there's no God there's no
[37:30] worship there's no God because God is
[37:32] the object of worship so I want to make
[37:35] sure that the foundation is laid this
[37:37] morning because we will say some things
[37:40] this morning because the truth is going
[37:42] to set you
[37:45] free
[37:49] Hallelujah in every age the worshippers
[37:51] of that age worshiped in spirit and in
[37:55] truth and in our day we have the full
[37:57] truth we have the full word so God has
[38:00] been longing for this day for the people
[38:02] who have the full word the full message
[38:05] the full Revelation to Worship in a way
[38:07] that could be called
[38:09] heresy Worship in a way that could be
[38:11] called fanatical Worship in a way that
[38:14] people could think you're crazy but that
[38:15] doesn't matter because you have a
[38:18] destination
[38:19] that nobody else could understand you
[38:22] have to realize this morning that every
[38:25] experience you went through was to bring
[38:27] you to this spot to catch a revelation
[38:30] that you are born of God that no weapon
[38:33] formed against you could prosper and
[38:35] that all things work together for good
[38:37] to them that love God and to them who
[38:40] are de called according to his purpose
[38:42] and the God I serve his purpose must be
[38:45] accomplished his purpose will be
[38:47] accomplished there's no other way around
[38:49] it you may be
[38:52] seated
[38:55] Hall
[38:57] hallelujah hallelujah so there's a
[39:00] jubilee coming friends there's a time of
[39:03] worship and restoration that we have
[39:04] never seen before and we've got to be
[39:07] ready for it is there not a cause don't
[39:10] we have enough sick people don't we have
[39:12] enough backsliders don't we have enough
[39:15] depressed people to begin to raise the
[39:17] standard and push the enemy out I woke
[39:20] up this morning and my chest was
[39:21] painting me and I said look how the
[39:23] enemy tries to raise up whenever
[39:25] something has got to happen Happ I know
[39:27] this morning that you had to fight all
[39:29] kind of stuff to get here this morning
[39:32] God knows all the trials you went
[39:34] through to be in the house of God this
[39:36] morning but the more the devil fights
[39:38] it's the greater the blessing the Devil
[39:41] is nervous this morning he wants to stop
[39:43] you but he cannot stop you you are an
[39:46] invincible Army you are a super Church
[39:49] you are a super race can the church say
[39:54] Amen so what do we do doing we are
[39:56] getting ready for a

[40:11] time when you're free from sickness free

[40:21] free from the Taskmaster free from the
[40:24] chain of Sin Sin holding you down uh you

[40:29] fall back one day that's going to be
[40:32] over one day you're going to raise up
[40:34] and you're not going to go back down
[40:36] because your permanent your state will
[40:39] be permanent can the church say
[40:42] Amen you may be seated I'm excited this
[40:46] morning because somebody's going to
[40:48] break free I can't break you free but
[40:51] who the son of man sets free is free
[40:53] indeed and the son of man was veiled in
[40:57] a son of man to bring a message of
[40:59] Deliverance to bring a more sure word of
[41:02] Prophecy all the scriptures will poting
[41:05] to this day because this is Jesus day
[41:08] I'm not talking about the Jesus of
[41:10] yesterday it's easy to talk about Jesus
[41:12] of yesterday it's easy but the Pam said
[41:15] to talk about what's to come but now

[42:22] sat down and he started
[42:24] smiling they ask why you smiling say I'm

[43:40] get to the message but I want to you see
[43:41] I really want to talk to you a little
[43:43] bit today so I'm going to do a bit of of
[43:45] exhortation before I talk to

[44:03] close that I could almost feel it and
[44:05] that this that and that was in 1960 he
[44:07] was speaking there he was he was looking
[44:09] for something he said that's what I've
[44:11] longed to see waiting for the time and
[44:14] remember a prophet is seeing in the
[44:15] future and he speak in present tense so
[44:18] he say that's what I've longed to see
[44:19] waiting for the time when we walk down
[44:22] the street and there lays a he's
[44:24] not speaking about the past he's
[44:25] speaking about the future and he's
[44:27] waiting for a time when there is a
[44:29] laying there from his mother's
[44:31] womb and Silver and Gold Have I None he
[44:34] was waiting for a time that is to break
[44:36] upon us when we will walk the street and
[44:39] by divine revelation and inspiration you
[44:42] walk into a situation and you could
[44:44] speak oh he said Wai him for the
[44:46] manifestation of the sons of
[44:50] God listen you may be seated it's not
[44:53] for your validation it's not for your
[44:56] confirmation it's not for your
[44:58] recommendation it's not for your
[45:00] recognition but when God will make
[45:03] himself
[45:04] known because that's his objective he
[45:07] wants to make himself known we're not
[45:09] here to hear me preach this morning
[45:11] we're not to hear to hear any man preach
[45:13] but we want God to make himself known
[45:16] when they'll stop sickness when they'll
[45:18] stop cancer when they'll stop diseases
[45:21] in other words when God makes himself
[45:23] known you'll see cancer begin to tremble
[45:26] you will see disease begin to tremble
[45:29] God may you make yourself known in the
[45:31] house this
[45:34] morning Hallelujah you may be seated

[45:39] hands on the sick but in that time we'll

[48:05] another desire to be a husband to be a

[51:35] can't preach this
[51:37] Hallelujah The Message Church don't want
[51:39] to preach this
[51:41] Hallelujah because there's a change from
[51:44] just seeing the prophet to the prophet's
[51:47] [Music]
[51:48] prophecy Isaiah's prophecy of a virgin
[51:51] shall conceive when Mary came on the
[51:54] line it switched from the prophet's word
[51:57] to the prophecy being
[52:00] fulfilled the same thing happened when
[52:02] Jesus was there because Jesus was
[52:04] walking and they were still speaking
[52:05] about the Messiah to
[52:07] come and they fear to realize that
[52:09] Messiah was on the
[52:11] earth and the Holy Ghost is here right
[52:14] now he's moving through the aisle right
[52:16] now look at the seal
[52:18] individuals and place them into the
[52:23] kingdom you may be seated
[52:26] I'm going to get to my message in a
[52:27] minute but I want to make sure we are on
[52:29] the same
[52:30] page that we go to the same place that
[52:34] we on our way to the same
[52:38] destination because after it all we all
[52:40] have to
[52:42] give an
[52:44] account amen for every service that you
[52:48] came to amen you have to give an account
[52:50] for every scripture that you read for
[52:53] every book that you read for every tape
[52:55] that you listen to because the objective
[52:58] is not to listen to tapes the objective
[53:01] is not just to be in church the
[53:03] objective is to live
[53:05] [Music]
[53:08] something and if you miss that you
[53:10] missed the whole picture the whole
[53:13] purpose of this great gospel this gospel
[53:17] is a gospel of
[53:19] change you cannot tell me you're here
[53:22] and you're the same but the brandom said
[53:24] when you come to church one of two
[53:26] things happen amen you either get better
[53:29] or you get worse how will you leave this
[53:32] service today will you be better or will
[53:36] you be worse God will change things in
[53:40] your situation to drive you into a state
[53:43] of
[53:44] emergency he can make your life easy if
[53:47] he wants it but will you call upon him
[53:51] in the EAS in Zion or does God have to
[53:54] turn up the heat to make sure and catch
[53:56] your attention make sure and catch your
[53:59] attention he wants to catch your
[54:01] attention and hold your attention can
[54:03] the church say
[54:09] Amen
[54:12] hus in the message here him there'll be
[54:14] a power put into the church and now is
[54:18] coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so
[54:20] anoint the people till they'll speak the
[54:23] word and it will create itself right
[54:26] there can the church say Amen so are you
[54:29] ready for the word this
[54:31] morning let us take our Bibles I want to
[54:34] read

[55:43] you breathe life upon it and speak to
[55:45] your people Lord may you deliver your
[55:48] people from every bondage Lord and may
[55:51] the Holy Ghost pour out here this
[55:53] morning Lord may you delivered the
[55:55] backsliders in our midst this morning
[55:57] and may the Holy Ghost find Lord rest
[55:59] and place in the hearts of the people
[56:02] Lord I will never be the same again may
[56:03] you break the power of sin Lord the
[56:06] power of faar and unbelief upon the
[56:08] people and may Lord such a joy be in the
[56:11] house Lord may you bless those who are
[56:13] here and those connected on the internet
[56:14] and those who would hear the tape commit
[56:17] the service into your hands may you
[56:18] bless the word and the reading of it in

[56:25] be
[56:26] seated so for my title this morning it's
[56:31] conference with God
[56:36] Amen in the message having conferences
[56:39] brother the brandham said in the
[56:41] text tonight of conferences we lately
[56:44] have heard so much about
[56:45] conferences wherever you pick up the
[56:47] paper you always see some Diplomat or
[56:50] some official or some convert at a
[56:52] certain place and whether it's United
[56:54] Nation know the government and right
[56:56] here in Trinidad they want to meet to
[56:58] talk about crime and this and that
[57:00] there's a conference going on and but B
[57:02] said why do we hold conferences all
[57:04] right what are they to do they are to
[57:06] get together and reason out different
[57:10] things where we come at a conference we
[57:13] have to
[57:14] reason
[57:16] together and I think this is one of the
[57:18] most beautiful scriptures when God said
[57:20] come and let you and I have a conference
[57:23] amen so that's speaking to any group I'm
[57:26] not speaking to groups I'm speaking to
[57:28] individuals this morning amen amen let
[57:32] us get together and kindly reason things
[57:35] out but though your sins be as scly they
[57:38] shall be as white as snow amen though
[57:42] they be red like Crimson they shall be
[57:44] white as
[57:45] wool if you'll only come and let us
[57:48] reason
[57:50] together and we find tonight and brother
[57:53] Bram said as everyone know that we are
[57:55] losing
[57:56] ground we are losing ground as a
[58:00] people the world is creeping in among us
[58:03] all right you can see it you can feel it
[58:06] you can tell it the world is moving in
[58:08] among us so I think this would be a
[58:11] wonderful time for us to have a
[58:13] conference and talk it over with God and
[58:16] find out what's the
[58:22] matter H now conferences is a get
[58:26] together and usually it is held in a
[58:27] time in a state of
[58:30] emergency and I want to pause a minute
[58:32] and really talk about this state of
[58:36] emergency because in this age coming out
[58:39] of Leia is a age where there's a feeling
[58:42] of need of
[58:43] nothing there's a age of ease in Zion
[58:46] there's a age of there's a comfort with
[58:49] knowing the message with having the
[58:50] message with coming to church and and
[58:52] when you dig beneath the surface
[58:56] outside of the Sunday worship sometime
[58:59] ago I spoke to the young people and my
[59:01] title was between
[59:05] Sundays because it's easy on a Sunday
[59:07] morning to come to church and oh there's
[59:09] a charge there's a Zeal there's an
[59:11] enthusiasm there's a recognition of
[59:13] deity there's an acknowledgment that God
[59:16] is God and you shout and you worship but
[59:19] when the service is over there's a daily
[59:22] struggle to deal with the issues on a
[59:24] Monday
[59:25] and on a Tuesday and on a Wednesday and
[59:28] by Thursday God help me you need a
[59:29] booster
[59:31] shot by Friday by Saturday by Sunday you
[59:34] need to come to church because you done
[59:36] backslid during the
[59:38] week
[59:40] Hallelujah but how do you measure this
[59:42] state of
[59:44] emergency there's an inverse
[59:46] relationship with the state of emergency
[59:49] and your prayer
[59:52] life people don't pray
[59:56] pray 5 minutes that doesn't cut it 10
[59:59] minutes that doesn't cut it 20 minutes
[1:00:02] that doesn't cut it if Jesus had to pray
[1:00:06] and would T earnestly what about
[1:00:09] us and we come to church and we make
[1:00:12] demands of God lord and he is hearing
[1:00:14] from you for the first time for the
[1:00:18] week it's a state of emergency when our
[1:00:21] children don't know the Bible am amen
[1:00:25] it's a state of emergency when the
[1:00:27] prophet's voice is a stranger not just
[1:00:30] to your house but some of us who have
[1:00:32] been in the message for a long time he
[1:00:34] has become a stranger to
[1:00:36] us it's a state of
[1:00:39] emergency it's a state of emergency when
[1:00:42] we know more about the political
[1:00:44] dimensions and what's happening in the
[1:00:46] US than what is happening right now in
[1:00:48] the Church of the Living God
[1:00:51] hallelujah it's a state of emergency
[1:00:54] when we are quick to hear what this
[1:00:56] church is doing and what that church is
[1:00:58] doing and what this church is doing and
[1:01:00] there's no blood on the doorpost of your
[1:01:04] house hallelu it's a state of emergency

[1:01:18] of
[1:01:21] emergency it's a state of emergency when
[1:01:24] people come to church to be prayed for
[1:01:27] and there's no faith in the church
[1:01:29] right because faith is based on
[1:01:32] forgiveness and people are holding arts
[1:01:34] and grudges in the church it's a state
[1:01:36] of
[1:01:41] emergency it's a state of emergency when
[1:01:44] you walked through the doors and you
[1:01:45] didn't even pray for the minister

[1:01:53] powers that he has to fight to deliver a
[1:01:56] [Music]

[1:02:01] husbands don't pray for their wives it's
[1:02:03] a state of emergency when wives don't
[1:02:06] even pray for their husbands it's a
[1:02:08] state of emergency when parents instead
[1:02:10] of arguing don't get down on their knees
[1:02:13] and pray for their
[1:02:16] children it's a state of emergency when
[1:02:19] we forget the power of the
[1:02:22] blood it's a state of Emer
[1:02:24] when we forget God forgives it's a state
[1:02:28] of emergency when we are guilty with
[1:02:30] unconfessed sin and we don't even come
[1:02:33] and bring it to the pastor to get prayed
[1:02:35] for it's a state of
[1:02:40] emergency you may be seated it's a state
[1:02:43] of emergency when fathers have forgotten
[1:02:46] their place in the homes we cannot speak
[1:02:49] about men being in crisis in the world
[1:02:51] that's the world but men cannot be in
[1:02:54] crisis in the Church of the Living God

[1:03:01] emergency the standards of the world
[1:03:04] cannot be our standards it has become a
[1:03:08] state of
[1:03:10] emergency
[1:03:12] Hallelujah
[1:03:15] am amen it's a state of emergency
[1:03:18] Hallelujah when you forget the
[1:03:20] importance of coming to the house of God
[1:03:23] my Lord
[1:03:25] it's a state of emergency when you
[1:03:28] interpret a word to yourself like a
[1:03:30] buffet I'll have chicken without the
[1:03:33] fish and I'll
[1:03:37] have it's a
[1:03:40] state of
[1:03:43] emergency when instead of praying for
[1:03:45] your brother you call five people and
[1:03:46] tell them you know what brother so and
[1:03:48] so
[1:03:49] did Hallelujah but come this

[1:04:01] issues this morning let's let's call a
[1:04:05] conference in the

[1:04:08] pray too
[1:04:10] much sorry we could sing too much we
[1:04:12] could jump too much we could shout too
[1:04:14] much but we could
[1:04:15] never we could never pray too
[1:04:18] much because that's the real conference
[1:04:21] it's to have a oldfashioned prayer
[1:04:23] meeting

[1:04:26] if you you really want to tell who the
[1:04:27] real church is you call a prayer

[1:04:32] churches because people their desires to
[1:04:34] hear a word give me a word give me a
[1:04:39] word but the sighing and the crying and
[1:04:42] the taring and the holding on and right
[1:04:45] it's a whole different story it's a
[1:04:47] whole different experience god brother
[1:04:50] Bram said in the message having
[1:04:51] conference I want to start tonight with
[1:04:53] the Eden conference
[1:04:56] God felt
[1:04:57] good after the first day and the second
[1:05:00] day he ended each day with the statement
[1:05:02] it was good Hallelujah he felt pleased
[1:05:06] he felt satisfied in so much that he
[1:05:09] could just walk away and know that he
[1:05:11] left things in a good
[1:05:13] condition when God made Man In His Image
[1:05:15] and took from his side a ribon made a
[1:05:17] woman made a helpmate he placed him in
[1:05:19] the Garden of Eden to be his beloved
[1:05:22] children amen beautiful but when his
[1:05:25] cheering had lost that shocking news
[1:05:27] struck Heaven your children are
[1:05:30] lost with the BAM his drama he said God
[1:05:33] brushed everything
[1:05:35] aside that there was in
[1:05:37] heaven he wouldn't send an angel to hunt
[1:05:40] them he wouldn't send a legion of angels
[1:05:43] God came
[1:05:44] himself to hunt his own Lost Child
[1:05:47] because there was a state of
[1:05:52] emergency brother BR is J in he said no
[1:05:55] doubt Michael might have stepped up all
[1:05:57] right let me
[1:05:59] go and fix the situation Hallelujah
[1:06:03] Gabriel and when the message come into
[1:06:06] heaven your children is lost they have
[1:06:08] sinned and gone away God didn't take
[1:06:10] Gabriel amen and say go and Hunt my
[1:06:12] children he came himself brother said it
[1:06:15] was a mansiz job a godsize
[1:06:20] job amen amen when God saw that shocking
[1:06:25] state of emergency brother BR said I
[1:06:27] suppose the first ever to come to heaven
[1:06:29] was when he heard that his children was
[1:06:31] lost and he came frantically up and down
[1:06:33] through the garden he went looking under
[1:06:35] every Bush Adam oh my son Adam where
[1:06:38] thou
[1:06:40] amen and that that's the kind of
[1:06:43] conference we have this morning amen
[1:06:46] amen amen amen and there stood Adam and
[1:06:49] Eve with their fig leaves sewn together
[1:06:51] behind the bush father going back and
[1:06:53] forth screaming where are you where are
[1:06:54] you and that same God goes up and down
[1:06:57] the aisles night after night screaming
[1:07:00] the same thing where are where
[1:07:03] out and he finds Adam and Eve the same
[1:07:06] way with some sort of creed that they
[1:07:08] have or denomination they're depending
[1:07:10] on to save them hiding behind some
[1:07:13] man-made theology when God made a
[1:07:15] preparation for you when he gave his son
[1:07:18] to die in your
[1:07:21] stead you know sometimes I find we are
[1:07:24] so disconnected from
[1:07:26] reality the other day I hurt my hand and
[1:07:30] it was painful and I my mind
[1:07:33] drifted anybody ever pong a nail and you
[1:07:36] missed your nail and you hit your
[1:07:38] finger how painful is
[1:07:41] that and my mind thought wait a minute
[1:07:45] when they were pounding the nail into
[1:07:47] jesus'
[1:07:52] hands
[1:07:58] we haven't reached the Death part yet
[1:08:00] but just one two
[1:08:03] three how painful that must have been
[1:08:07] and we seem disconnected from the
[1:08:09] reality that he paid the price that we
[1:08:11] were supposed to
[1:08:13] pay and now when he was on his way to
[1:08:16] Calvary every sin that we committed and
[1:08:18] would commit was solely being put on his
[1:08:21] shoulder and he didn't even deserve it
[1:08:23] it but he was carrying it
[1:08:27] Hallelujah because if he didn't do it
[1:08:29] you wouldn't stand a chance I wouldn't
[1:08:32] stand a chance there'd be no hope for us
[1:08:34] but he bore it step by step getting
[1:08:38] heavier and heavier the weight of the
[1:08:40] Cross becoming so heavy till he couldn't
[1:08:43] even carry it
[1:08:44] himself the same man who said peace be
[1:08:47] still couldn't even Carry the Cross they
[1:08:50] had to find a man to carry it for him
[1:08:54] the weight of our sins the weight of our
[1:08:56] pain the weight of our mistakes upon him
[1:08:59] but yet he still went
[1:09:01] on and you want to give up when he took
[1:09:04] another step in pain and you want to
[1:09:07] give up and he saying I got to make it
[1:09:10] I've got to get to
[1:09:12] Calvary because my people deserve a
[1:09:17] [Applause]
[1:09:22] chance
[1:09:26] H
[1:09:28] hallelu
[1:09:31] hallu am amen amen hallelujah
[1:09:40] hallelujah thank you Lord said Adam and
[1:09:43] Eve hiding behind their own ideas and
[1:09:46] God made a preparation for you and he
[1:09:48] gave his son to die in your stad you've
[1:09:50] got to be born again Creeds won't work
[1:09:53] amen that conference is held at some
[1:09:55] Society but God's conference is held in
[1:09:58] Eden to take care of your sins and there
[1:10:00] was one held at Calvary will'll get to
[1:10:02] that later on to take care of your sin
[1:10:04] and the sin problem and your sickness
[1:10:06] and all that will ever happen to you
[1:10:09] Hallelujah preparations have been
[1:10:14] made I'm so glad but theam said of the
[1:10:17] Eden conference amen he made a way a
[1:10:19] preparation a way to take away sin amen
[1:10:22] he made a way that you could come back
[1:10:24] again be brought into Fellowship where
[1:10:28] you lost and standing out somewhere
[1:10:30] undone without God God made a
[1:10:32] preparation at this
[1:10:35] conference and in Eden he made a
[1:10:37] temporary preparation until the real
[1:10:40] preparation would be given through the
[1:10:42] sacrificial Life of Christ amen so from
[1:10:45] Eden they started to move into that age
[1:10:47] of bulls and goats which was a
[1:10:52] temporary but the say said the figs that
[1:10:54] they covered with that was their idea
[1:10:55] but they were supposed to be covered by
[1:10:57] Blood hallelujah praise God until the
[1:11:00] real sacrifice because the blood and of
[1:11:03] bulls and goats could only cover but
[1:11:06] when Jesus came his blood was not to
[1:11:08] cover his blood was to remove sin his
[1:11:12] blood is like a bleach you drop it into
[1:11:14] disc Scarlet sin there's a
[1:11:16] transformation take place there's still
[1:11:19] Power in the Blood this
[1:11:22] morning
[1:11:24] what sin you talking
[1:11:26] about as far as the East is from the
[1:11:29] West oh do your sins be as Scarlet they
[1:11:33] shall be as white as snow but Bram said
[1:11:37] that conference on Calvary was
[1:11:38] successful he said it'll beat Satan
[1:11:41] anywhere God's word will defeat Satan
[1:11:44] any place any time on any condition
[1:11:48] though your sins be as scal you said any
[1:11:51] condition brother Brandon that's exactly
[1:11:53] what it said so when you feel down
[1:11:56] remind Satan about that conference on
[1:11:59] Calvary when that blood was said it was
[1:12:02] set for you it was set for you it was
[1:12:05] set for
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:16] you for your sins be
[1:12:19] ascal they shall be white as
[1:12:22] snow the only thing I'm asking you to do
[1:12:24] is come to my prepared place the
[1:12:28] altar that's really this message is
[1:12:31] going somewhere he said come to my
[1:12:32] prepared place the
[1:12:35] altar because if there's no altar in
[1:12:37] your home you're going to miss it
[1:12:39] friends if there's no alt in your life
[1:12:42] you're going to miss it right God long
[1:12:44] for
[1:12:45] Fellowship that's what he wanted in Eden
[1:12:48] he would come in the cool of the evening
[1:12:50] for Fellowship that's right
[1:12:55] that Fellowship is a conversation it's a
[1:12:58] relationship and having the books and
[1:13:00] the T and the Bible that's that's that's
[1:13:02] temporary until you could speak to him
[1:13:05] lip to a until you could talk to him and
[1:13:09] he could talk back to you and he could
[1:13:11] have a conversation with you and like
[1:13:13] Adam in the cool of the evening he would
[1:13:15] come and say I move this mountain and I
[1:13:18] was feeling all right and I told the
[1:13:20] birds to come in and I did this and I
[1:13:22] did this and and God can say that's what
[1:13:24] I like you you're my boy I like how you
[1:13:26] do it you do it just like me that's a
[1:13:29] conversation that's Fellowship that's a

[1:13:56] Lord he wasn't looking to men and to
[1:13:59] trust in men he was looking for God and
[1:14:02] he wanted a relationship in so much that
[1:14:05] despite his failures God could say
[1:14:07] that's a man after my own heart because
[1:14:09] he put me first in everything that he
[1:14:12] [Applause]

[1:14:30] preparation the first emergency was
[1:14:32] called and God gave the answer and give
[1:14:35] the preparation but people don't want to
[1:14:37] take that
[1:14:39] preparation Hallelujah God made the
[1:14:41] decision it isn't to us to make a
[1:14:43] decision what we should do God makes a
[1:14:45] decision what to do it was God I said
[1:14:48] you must be born again it's his word it
[1:14:52] was his decision the blood was the way
[1:14:55] not fig Leaf nor any other kind of

[1:15:30] talk about another conference his
[1:15:32] children of Israel were in crisis they
[1:15:35] were in bondage for a long time and he
[1:15:37] had heard the cries of his people that
[1:15:39] had reach a state of emergency so God
[1:15:41] have to call a conference to get the
[1:15:44] attention of somebody to do something
[1:15:46] because God needs somebody to use he is
[1:15:49] God but he has to extend himself through
[1:15:52] somebody whether it's one person 25 God
[1:15:55] is going to have a witness so he found a
[1:15:58] Man Called Moses but the BAM said Moses
[1:16:00] was scared Moses was a failure but the
[1:16:04] Bram said he tried like Adam his own fig
[1:16:07] leaves he tried hiding he tried running

[1:16:41] and they were talking about someday
[1:16:42] we're going to get out of prison someday
[1:16:45] we're going to be delivered and the
[1:16:46] Bible said God heard the cries of his
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:16:52] people heard the cries of his people it
[1:16:55] was a state of emergency you maybe
[1:16:57] seated that's a problem with some of us
[1:17:00] we don't realize it's a state of
[1:17:01] emergency until some it's too
[1:17:03] late but when a baby in a state of
[1:17:06] emergency the baby starts to
[1:17:09] cry you may be seated everything is a
[1:17:12] crisis for a baby you know because they
[1:17:14] can manage and prioritize what's
[1:17:16] important what's not so there's one
[1:17:18] response I want to sleep cry I want food
[1:17:22] cry I want to get out the crib cry
[1:17:25] everything is a
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:27] crisis but as we live we get more mature
[1:17:31] and we we get tough and we get strong
[1:17:34] and we don't need anybody and we could
[1:17:36] do it but God wants some people who
[1:17:37] could get into a state of Crisis but the
[1:17:40] brandham called it a state of
[1:17:41] desperation he said you can't hear from
[1:17:43] God until you get
[1:17:46] desperate and you can't get desperate
[1:17:49] until God speaks to you so I pray God
[1:17:52] speaks to you this morning so you can
[1:17:54] get desperate to begin to cry and say
[1:17:56] Lord my prayer life and you cry out Lord
[1:18:01] my joy and you cry out Lord my back and
[1:18:06] you cry out Lord my head is hurting and
[1:18:09] you cry out Lord my family is in trouble
[1:18:13] and you cry out sometime you don't even
[1:18:15] need words but the cry gets to God and
[1:18:19] he says you know what I have heard the
[1:18:21] cries of my people and I have come down
[1:18:24] I'm not sending Gabriel I'm not sending
[1:18:27] Michael I'm not sending a messenger I'm
[1:18:30] not sending anybody but the Lord himself
[1:18:33] descend with a shout because I've heard
[1:18:36] the cries of my people from the age of
[1:18:38] Paul from the age of irenius from the
[1:18:41] age of Martin they were crying Luther's
[1:18:44] day they cried Wesley's day they cried
[1:18:47] the Pentecostal day they
[1:18:50] cried but then all of a sudden a great
[1:18:53] conference seven angels come from
[1:18:56] eternity in this great conference and
[1:18:59] there was one with a great swep back
[1:19:01] Wings he was happy to be on the earth
[1:19:04] once more for a long time he had to
[1:19:07] finish this war that started in heaven
[1:19:10] that came into the Earth and he called a
[1:19:14] conference oh somebody say Amen you may
[1:19:19] be seated and just like God had to catch
[1:19:22] mes his attention God find an unlikely
[1:19:25] person a 20th century prophet he wasn't
[1:19:29] tall he wasn't strong he didn't have
[1:19:31] eloquent words he was a simple man he
[1:19:34] was a simple man but when the son of man
[1:19:37] was filed in a son of man and he began
[1:19:40] to speak what did he say Let My People
[1:19:46] Go
[1:19:48] hallelujah
[1:19:50] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:19:53] Hallelujah and that Prophet declared a
[1:19:56] message of Deliverance that Prophet from
[1:19:59] that conference you may be
[1:20:02] seated if you've ever been in a high
[1:20:05] powered
[1:20:07] meeting speak to brother the Blackman
[1:20:09] speak to some of these brothers here if
[1:20:10] you ever been in a high powerered
[1:20:11] meeting out of the meeting there are
[1:20:14] certain action
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:18] items there are some minutes from the
[1:20:21] meeting that defines what's supposed to
[1:20:24] happen what was discussed in the meeting
[1:20:27] what's being kept off the books so we're
[1:20:29] going to discuss it but we're not going
[1:20:31] to write
[1:20:34] it we're going to discuss it in the
[1:20:36] meeting this we're going to keep off the
[1:20:37] books and these are the action items so
[1:20:40] out of this meeting when Seven Angels
[1:20:41] Came From eternity there were some
[1:20:43] action
[1:20:44] items there was some minutes there were
[1:20:47] some things that had to be finished a
[1:20:50] super church was there a church without
[1:20:52] Puerto Rico was there seven Thunders
[1:20:55] Gathering the bride was there seven
[1:20:57] Thunders show how to go is there action
[1:21:00] items you may be
[1:21:03] seated you may be seated for a
[1:21:06] minute we all over the place but we have
[1:21:08] in church this morning Apple computer
[1:21:12] one of the biggest companies in the
[1:21:13] world all right they developed a system
[1:21:16] of management that is revolutionary they
[1:21:19] believe that you must have for every
[1:21:22] position every office what they call the
[1:21:27] D the
[1:21:29] directly responsible
[1:21:35] individual because Steve Jobs said I
[1:21:37] want to blame the team for anything I
[1:21:39] want to know who was directly
[1:21:43] responsible for
[1:21:45] this so in management school they tell
[1:21:48] you out of a meeting should have action
[1:21:50] items should have who is responsible
[1:21:52] possible and when it should
[1:21:58] happen with the random said everything
[1:22:01] that man has achieved has always been
[1:22:05] trying to improve on what they did
[1:22:07] before but God operates differently
[1:22:10] whatever God does God sees the future
[1:22:14] and he is doing based on what he wants
[1:22:15] to do so the Olympics man runs and he
[1:22:19] breaks the last record but God he says
[1:22:22] your body shall be changed there's no
[1:22:25] record to compare that to that's just
[1:22:27] the goal changing body you saying b car
[1:22:30] run into that all of a sudden you become
[1:22:32] the fastest runner when you change from
[1:22:34] Mortal to immortality who could catch
[1:22:36] you that's a different kind of
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:40] record you may be seated so I'm going
[1:22:43] somewhere so if man can develop systems
[1:22:45] that have things to do and who does it
[1:22:48] and by when don't you think God who
[1:22:50] developed everything has a Time frame
[1:22:53] has the people has the action item so
[1:22:56] when God says once more the world will
[1:22:59] hear direct from God God has names there
[1:23:03] God has when it's going to happen he has
[1:23:05] who is going to do it you can miss it if
[1:23:07] you want
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:10] to you may be
[1:23:13] seated I feel so good brother the Adrian
[1:23:16] you may be seated you know there are
[1:23:17] people who are backsliding and they
[1:23:19] think there's no hope for them in
[1:23:21] know amen the people who backsliding and
[1:23:24] don't even know they're backsliding and
[1:23:26] there's hope for them
[1:23:27] too because the hope is not in you
[1:23:31] Hallelujah the hope is in Christ in you
[1:23:35] the hope of glory because that seed that
[1:23:38] was placed before the foundation of the
[1:23:39] world that seed could only bring forth
[1:23:42] after its kind it can't bring forth
[1:23:44] anything else and orange seed can only
[1:23:47] bring forth the orange you don't hear me
[1:23:50] this morning Hal Hallelujah so pile it
[1:23:54] on devil throw what you want on me this
[1:23:57] seed is going to bring
[1:23:59] forth you may be
[1:24:01] seated
[1:24:03] Hallelujah that's the reason why no
[1:24:06] matter how frustrated you get no matter
[1:24:08] how depressed you get no matter when you
[1:24:10] want to walk away there's something on
[1:24:11] the inside you can go so far but there's
[1:24:14] a wall you hit boom you can't go that
[1:24:16] way you try you do this you try to shake
[1:24:19] you try to dance you try to you try to
[1:24:22] Brock it up you try to do all kind of
[1:24:24] stuff but it's a wall boom you hit the
[1:24:26] wall and you can't go no further you try
[1:24:29] to go back boom you hit a wall you can't
[1:24:31] go further what's that it's a wall of
[1:24:34] predestination there's a covering over
[1:24:36] you there's a blood sacrifice over you
[1:24:39] and when he sees the
[1:24:42] blood
[1:24:44] hallelujah hallelujah his hand is long
[1:24:47] enough to reach you this morning there's
[1:24:50] no place he cannot find you you your joy
[1:24:53] is going to be restored your peace is
[1:24:56] going to be restored uh your Revival is
[1:24:59] going to be restored come let us reason

[1:25:31] spirit the way they come on now you know
[1:25:33] what I'm talking about Hallelujah I like
[1:25:36] the old time singing the old time
[1:25:39] shouting Hallelujah the lid of hell is
[1:25:42] open and there are streams of demon
[1:25:44] powers but God will have some
[1:25:46] individuals who will stand in
[1:25:49] 2016 and declare that he's a the same
[1:25:52] yesterday the same today and the same

[1:32:02] godl there's no recognition from man
[1:32:05] when you were in that
[1:32:07] conference with
[1:32:09] God that conference with God is that
[1:32:12] secret
[1:32:13] chamber that secret place amen with you
[1:32:17] and God alone when you can uncover every
[1:32:21] door
[1:32:22] brother BR and preached a message doors
[1:32:24] indoors you familiar with it he said
[1:32:27] many times when you invite someone to
[1:32:28] your home you keep them in the porch or
[1:32:30] the living room and depending on the
[1:32:33] Comfort level you could bring them to
[1:32:34] the kitchen there's some people you
[1:32:35] canot bring to your kitchen amen because
[1:32:38] if they see what you have in the
[1:32:40] kitchen
[1:32:42] amen amen they will eat you
[1:32:50] out
[1:32:55] then there are some people when you're
[1:32:56] more comfortable with them you can take
[1:32:57] them to your study all
[1:33:00] right sometime ago some years ago there
[1:33:03] was somebody I knew who whenever they
[1:33:04] come to say where you got that where you
[1:33:06] got that where you got
[1:33:08] that where you get that you have you
[1:33:11] have extra of that you you don't have
[1:33:14] two is only one you
[1:33:18] have and something invariably happens
[1:33:20] after a while you just stop inviting
[1:33:22] them be like no no no no no no no I will
[1:33:24] come to

[1:33:33] know you don't need to come by me it's
[1:33:34] all
[1:33:38] right but brother brandom saying
[1:33:41] that many of us want to invite God into
[1:33:44] the living
[1:33:47] room but we have to be comfortable to
[1:33:50] invite him into every room room amen
[1:33:53] amen of our hearts hallelujah amen
[1:33:59] there's certain secrets we try to hide
[1:34:00] from other people but there's nothing we
[1:34:02] could truly hide or ever
[1:34:05] hide from
[1:34:08] God and we all have to come face to face
[1:34:12] with who we are to
[1:34:14] God it was very notable in Germany
[1:34:17] convention hearing the
[1:34:20] eyewitnesses of the bram's ministry
[1:34:23] speak and they all had something very
[1:34:26] common to say us they had the consistent
[1:34:29] message that when you stood in front of
[1:34:32] the Prophet you felt
[1:34:34] naked amen you were suddenly aware that
[1:34:37] he could see everything about you am in
[1:34:41] so much that some people would avoid
[1:34:43] coming close to the prophet in an
[1:34:46] attempt to hide what was going on with
[1:34:49] them amen because he had eagle eyes he
[1:34:52] had eyes of his father Hallelujah so he
[1:34:57] could discern what's going
[1:34:59] on in your
[1:35:02] life God is looking for an honest heart
[1:35:06] Hallelujah we have too many
[1:35:11] actors and the actors are those who want
[1:35:14] people to think it's it's all
[1:35:16] right when you are
[1:35:20] drowning
[1:35:23] it's okay to say I need
[1:35:25] help amen amen it's all right to say I
[1:35:28] need
[1:35:29] prayer it's all right to say I am
[1:35:32] drowning and I
[1:35:34] need a
[1:35:38] Lifeboat amen Peter stepped out and
[1:35:42] walked under the water and the moment he
[1:35:45] took his eyes off of
[1:35:49] Christ as brother over preached many
[1:35:51] times Peter was a Fisher when he could
[1:35:53] swim he could have fell in the water and
[1:35:54] then backstop smoothly back to the boat
[1:35:58] but he said Lord I'm
[1:36:00] sinking
[1:36:03] help and this message come let us reason
[1:36:07] together gives you the opportunity to
[1:36:09] say Lord I am
[1:36:13] sinking help me amen stop acting and
[1:36:18] pretending and playing we all all need
[1:36:23] God more than we have ever needed him
[1:36:27] before if there ever was a time to say
[1:36:30] Lord I need you hallelujah it's now I'm
[1:36:35] not speaking for anybody I'm speaking
[1:36:37] for myself and that should be your
[1:36:39] position this morning amen
[1:36:43] hallelujah amen
[1:36:46] Hall Lord I need you yes Lord I think
[1:36:50] back to God's Prophet Hallelujah he had
[1:36:53] done Miracles he had seen the sick
[1:36:55] healed and and after his wife and his
[1:36:57] daughter died and imagine God's Prophet
[1:37:00] came to the spot where he tried to take
[1:37:02] his own
[1:37:03] life yes
[1:37:07] yes and it was not a
[1:37:09] thought it was something he actually
[1:37:12] attempted to do amen that's right and
[1:37:16] had it not been for the Lord intervening
[1:37:19] when he pulled the trigger
[1:37:22] it would have been a different outcome
[1:37:24] that's
[1:37:25] right wow and there are always moments
[1:37:28] in our lives when we recognize we need
[1:37:30] help
[1:37:33] hallah so God slift it in the scripture
[1:37:36] come let us reason together amen let us
[1:37:41] talk it
[1:37:43] over because sometime we get so caught
[1:37:45] up with the forest we miss the
[1:37:49] trees we get so caught him in the
[1:37:51] Journey of life we miss the simple
[1:37:53] things that God places along our journey
[1:37:57] that we could be like
[1:37:59] him it's not about being in a position
[1:38:01] or being in church it's being like him
[1:38:04] come let us reason together am though
[1:38:08] your sins be as
[1:38:10] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:38:14] hallelujah what is sin go brother Bram
[1:38:18] said sin is is unbelief Hallelujah he
[1:38:21] said smoking and drinking and running
[1:38:24] around and those are the attributes of
[1:38:27] sin amen but the definition of sin is
[1:38:34] unbelief so if you find yourself here
[1:38:37] this morning and you're struggling to
[1:38:40] believe and you're struggling in your
[1:38:43] walk God could change that situation
[1:38:46] today in your life and give you a
[1:38:50] supernatural experience that you have
[1:38:52] never had
[1:38:54] before thank you Lord Moses tried to
[1:38:57] work it out his own way after his
[1:38:59] conference amen amen or before his
[1:39:01] conference rather and he found that he
[1:39:03] was
[1:39:04] wrong and by doing so like many others
[1:39:06] who backslide listen for the prophet
[1:39:09] from one Revival to the other going up
[1:39:13] and trying to impersonate a Christian or
[1:39:16] standing and making a sign or some
[1:39:18] Declaration of creed that we cite or
[1:39:20] recite
[1:39:21] we find ourselves in a few days defeated
[1:39:24] because we're trying to do it in
[1:39:27] ourselves he says it will never work
[1:39:30] amen we must meet God's program word by
[1:39:33] word letter by letter
[1:39:37] amen amen listen carefully friends and I
[1:39:41] want you to get this you see anything
[1:39:43] that you trying to do the intellectual
[1:39:45] mind is so contrary to the
[1:39:49] spirit the int ual mind thinks it has to
[1:39:52] be smart and wise but the holy spirit is
[1:39:56] humble amen so this is the key break
[1:39:59] down all you ever
[1:40:03] knowed break down all you ever know and
[1:40:07] walk sweet and humble before the Lord
[1:40:10] loving him with all your heart with all
[1:40:13] your mind and with all your strength
[1:40:17] that's where the Holy Spirit works and
[1:40:20] it makes you do things you didn't think
[1:40:21] you would ever do it'll make you repent
[1:40:25] and go back and shake hands and make up
[1:40:28] with people that you could join church
[1:40:31] and still call yourself a Christian and
[1:40:33] hear it down in your heart you can be
[1:40:36] led of the Holy Spirit and do
[1:40:38] that
[1:40:40] Hallelujah you can't cheat you can't lie
[1:40:42] you can't pull Shady deals it's got to
[1:40:45] be out and above board and the Holy
[1:40:47] Spirit will approve
[1:40:49] it I hope this helped somebody this
[1:40:53] morning
[1:40:55] hallelujah
[1:40:57] amen listen carefully Moses tried but he
[1:41:00] failed God had called him and there's no
[1:41:02] doubt in the hearing of my voice there
[1:41:05] may be many people that's God called the
[1:41:07] same way but we try to appease that by
[1:41:11] joining church or doing something
[1:41:12] religious it'll never satisfied you need
[1:41:16] a conference with God Amen Hallelujah
[1:41:20] can the church say Amen it was God's
[1:41:22] selected Place listen carefully so Moses
[1:41:26] god determined because he elected him to
[1:41:28] do so he wanded in the desert and one
[1:41:30] day on The Backs side of the desert God
[1:41:32] decided to call his runaway Prophet you
[1:41:35] heard what he called him oh yeah his
[1:41:37] runaway prophet he had a purpose and a
[1:41:39] calling but he was hiding from it his
[1:41:41] runaway prophet and he selected a
[1:41:43] certain tree I've always wonder what he
[1:41:46] put on that tree that it didn't burn up
[1:41:48] that's the prophet the leaves were
[1:41:49] popping and cracking and the fire
[1:41:51] burning and I don't know how long it
[1:41:53] burned but it didn't burn it was God's
[1:41:56] selected place to meet his
[1:41:58] Prophet God selects the place to have
[1:42:01] his conferences just as the Kings and
[1:42:04] the rulers of the nation select their
[1:42:05] places for conferences God selects his
[1:42:09] place my honest prayer is that your seat
[1:42:12] today or your standing place he's
[1:42:15] speaking today is God selected place for
[1:42:18] you that he can talk to you speak to you
[1:42:22] do something or say something that would
[1:42:24] attract your
[1:42:27] attention can the church say
[1:42:30] Amen oh just give the Lord a hand of
[1:42:32] Praise this
[1:42:49] morning and brother Bram goes on he
[1:42:51] speaks about different conferences he
[1:42:53] speaks about the Red Sea conference he
[1:42:55] said Moses was in line of God's Duty and
[1:42:58] in the line of scripture and the first
[1:42:59] thing for a man to do is find out if
[1:43:01] something went wrong is check himself
[1:43:03] are first you in the line of God's word
[1:43:05] and the next thing you in the line of
[1:43:06] duty following what the Holy Spirit told
[1:43:08] you then if that be so there's only one
[1:43:10] thing left that's a conference and they
[1:43:12] were on their March after being
[1:43:13] separated and a call out people they
[1:43:15] come to the Red Sea and they had to call
[1:43:17] a halt they couldn't cross over amen the
[1:43:20] Great
[1:43:21] General Joshua to raise his hand and
[1:43:23] sound the trumpet stop quit marching is
[1:43:25] an obstacle before us we have the
[1:43:27] mountains on each side we are down here
[1:43:29] in the valley and we have to stop and
[1:43:31] when that church ever stops that's when
[1:43:33] Satan takes over we've got to move
[1:43:36] constantly rapidly marching towards Zion
[1:43:39] Don't Let the Church of the Living God
[1:43:41] ever be guilty of stopping and they
[1:43:43] stopped and said what's the matter here
[1:43:45] and as soon as they stopped and pitched
[1:43:46] their tents and begin to rest a while
[1:43:48] they heard the rumble of Wheels and the
[1:43:51] only way of Escape they had was backward
[1:43:53] and here come Pharaoh's Army moving in
[1:43:55] to block them across the soldiers
[1:43:57] knowing the strategy how to shut them
[1:43:59] off there was the Red Sea before them
[1:44:01] perhaps two or three miles across here
[1:44:04] was the high mountains they couldn't
[1:44:05] climb them they'd be like sheep
[1:44:07] scattered out there Hallelujah and as
[1:44:10] soon as the Hal was called and Pharaoh's
[1:44:12] Army was seen coming Moses called the
[1:44:14] conference
[1:44:15] Hallelujah and he began to reach out to
[1:44:18] God Amen he said Lord I've mastered this
[1:44:20] place but an obstacle has stopped us we
[1:44:22] have had to call a
[1:44:25] halt and then when the Brandon begins to
[1:44:27] minister to the people he said like our
[1:44:29] brother here in the wheelchair
[1:44:30] Hallelujah like maybe you're sitting
[1:44:32] there with cancer or heart trouble or
[1:44:34] something that you know you're just
[1:44:36] going to die right away the enemy has
[1:44:38] stopped
[1:44:39] you he has brought you to a halt amen
[1:44:43] maybe you come to a Hal before the enemy
[1:44:45] overtook you maybe there's something in
[1:44:48] your life that caus you to Halt whatever
[1:44:50] it is is you still have the privilege of
[1:44:52] a
[1:44:53] conference let's talk it over with him

[1:44:58] what the enemy is he is never too great
[1:45:01] for our God we need a
[1:45:06] conference
[1:45:08] Hallelujah so Moses went up in a certain
[1:45:10] place and held a conference he didn't
[1:45:12] know what to do thank you Lord God still
[1:45:16] ready listen to The Prophet maybe you
[1:45:18] broke up your home prise God maybe left
[1:45:20] your husband or left your wife maybe you
[1:45:22] run off from your children there might
[1:45:24] be many things in this life that the
[1:45:26] enemy has trapped you into but remember

[1:45:31] rights to have a conference with God yes
[1:45:34] sir talk it over with him he's a very
[1:45:37] present help in a time of trouble then

[1:45:43] was his conference oh great leader of
[1:45:45] Israel I've done all this at your
[1:45:47] command I have led these people just as

[1:46:10] pamman is dramatizing he say perhaps
[1:46:12] sitting there on the top of the rock I
[1:46:14] want you to understand the position
[1:46:16] Moses really had no clue of how to fix
[1:46:19] the situation right right God had
[1:46:21] brought him to that spot but he was at a
[1:46:23] halt amen his Christian Journey was at a
[1:46:25] halt he had been in the message for a
[1:46:27] long time but he was at a halt he didn't
[1:46:30] know how to go forward he felt he was
[1:46:32] trapped in he cornered he felt he had no
[1:46:34] reason to shout he had no reason to
[1:46:37] worship he had no reason to do anything
[1:46:39] but he called a
[1:46:40] conference I said Lord I've done
[1:46:42] everything you told me to do I've tried

[1:55:55] Daniel and the Lion's then he's in the
[1:55:57] conference he's watching the lion the

[1:56:01] sudden the the lion realizes that this
[1:56:04] one is different he had eaten people
[1:56:06] before but none like this man he had
[1:56:09] eaten no can before but this man was
[1:56:11] looking different this man was smelling
[1:56:14] different this man was walking different

[1:56:47] different because the conference
[1:56:49] empowers you with information and
[1:56:52] Revelation and knowledge you didn't have
[1:56:54] before because the secret things belong
[1:56:57] to God but those things which are
[1:56:59] revealed it's in the conference that God
[1:57:01] could give you Revelation that's why we
[1:57:03] have this conference this morning so
[1:57:05] that divine revelation could drop down
[1:57:08] to let you know who you are who the
[1:57:11] devil is and who God is to know that
[1:57:13] every promise is
[1:57:18] yours

[1:57:40] came for this morning I didn't come to
[1:57:42] see you I didn't come to see anybody
[1:57:44] else I came for a conference but there's
[1:57:46] something burning in my heart and there
[1:57:48] was somebody who had a need his name was
[1:57:51] Nicodemus and he looked and he searched
[1:57:53] he was a secret believer he had
[1:57:55] questions in his heart he had been in
[1:57:57] church a long time he had been a
[1:57:59] religious man but he was looking for a
[1:58:01] conference and he went to Jesus he said
[1:58:03] come let us reason together how shall a
[1:58:06] man get eternal life he going to reason
[1:58:08] and he reasoned and Jesus said you must
[1:58:10] be born again and all of a sudden a
[1:58:13] transition be to take place because he
[1:58:15] had a
[1:58:18] conference
[1:58:23] Hallelujah he may be seated
[1:58:24] Hall there are only two outcomes all
[1:58:27] right of the conference you either get
[1:58:30] better or you get worse here's another
[1:58:33] man he has question in his heart and he
[1:58:36] comes to Jesus this is no longer the
[1:58:38] Jesus of the Old Testament this is the
[1:58:40] Jesus of the New Testament so he's
[1:58:42] walking around you could see him you
[1:58:44] could touch him you could talk to him
[1:58:46] you could invite him to your house you
[1:58:48] could you could you could you could
[1:58:49] touch him he is there and this man come
[1:58:51] to Jesus Jesus he's a young man what
[1:58:54] shall I do to inherit eternal life oh my
[1:58:57] God and Jesus is now in the conference
[1:59:00] they're reasoning together all right and
[1:59:03] he says if you obey the
[1:59:05] Commandments obey the Lord all right
[1:59:08] obey your father and mother do
[1:59:10] everything you'll be all right he said
[1:59:11] but but I've done all this from my youth
[1:59:13] what laer yet now they're reasoning
[1:59:15] together amen they're trying to resolve
[1:59:18] the situation right he has a question in
[1:59:20] his heart and he had reached a point he
[1:59:22] couldn't go further because he knew deep
[1:59:24] down he was missing something that's why
[1:59:26] he asked a question what lack I yet he
[1:59:28] was not feeling comfortable that's why
[1:59:30] he asked the
[1:59:31] question what lack I yet because I come
[1:59:34] to church and when I try to shout and
[1:59:35] jump and I do the motion but I still
[1:59:37] missing something wasn't like
[1:59:42] yet and they reason it together
[1:59:44] Hallelujah and Jesus said go sell all
[1:59:47] that you have and give to the PO and the
[1:59:50] man walked
[1:59:52] away
[1:59:55] sorrowful because he had something in
[1:59:57] his
[1:59:58] heart that the conference
[2:00:02] revealed
[2:00:05] yes it may have been on a subconscious
[2:00:08] level something he had but he wasn't
[2:00:10] even conscious of how deep it has
[2:00:13] affecting his life it took that
[2:00:15] reasoning together to give him the
[2:00:17] answer so that he could fix the problem
[2:00:21] and the B said Jesus loved him but that
[2:00:22] man he walked away sorrowful
[2:00:28] hallelujah

[2:00:35] will you leave this
[2:00:37] conference today amen yet there's

[2:00:53] testimonies I've I've seen things and

[2:01:12] reasoning he's negotiating he's talking
[2:01:14] he's pleading just say the
[2:01:18] word Jesus is astonished because this
[2:01:20] man he's a gentile but he tapped into
[2:01:24] Isaiah come let us reason together he
[2:01:26] reached there in a scripture and he's
[2:01:28] coming he's having a conversation with
[2:01:29] Jesus J said go thy way thy servant is
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:33] healed and Jesus turns to the elders and
[2:01:35] the deacons and say if only I can see
[2:01:37] this kind of faith in Israel who is this
[2:01:41] man this man left the conference and he
[2:01:45] didn't ask if my servant is
[2:01:48] healed
[2:01:50] he asked the question what time was he
[2:01:53] healed because he understood who he was
[2:01:56] in the conference with he understood who
[2:01:59] he was talking to he understood the God
[2:02:03] he was speaking
[2:02:04] [Applause]

[2:02:13] outcome of your

[2:02:18] another woman rushes up to Jesus Jesus
[2:02:20] my daughter is vexed with the
[2:02:23] devil come let us reason
[2:02:27] together Jesus said it's not fit it's
[2:02:29] not meat it's not appropriate to take
[2:02:32] the children's bread and cast it
[2:02:38] dogs you see reasoning is is a back and

[2:03:31] woman she has her
[2:03:34] struggles not much information is given
[2:03:36] about her but she's trying her very best
[2:03:40] to make ends
[2:03:41] meet she's trying her very best to find
[2:03:44] herself in this world that she lives
[2:03:47] in Hallelujah

[2:04:09] that didn't work out she had another one
[2:04:11] that didn't work out
[2:04:13] Jesus and it feels like a spiral that
[2:04:17] doesn't just have an answer

[2:04:23] conference when she has an appointment
[2:04:25] she didn't even know she had she shows
[2:04:27] up on her regular routine and there
[2:04:30] standing at the well is somebody who is
[2:04:32] looking very tired because the Bible

[2:05:54] different yes Hallelujah he is there and
[2:05:57] it's a different kind of a conference
[2:06:00] it's the first time we see Jesus almost
[2:06:02] completely
[2:06:04] vulnerable because the weight of sin is
[2:06:07] slowly beginning to creep onto his
[2:06:09] shoulders and he's coming to terms with

[2:06:45] called Jesus and said unto him are thou
[2:06:47] the king of the Jews
[2:06:50] Jesus answered them saying sayest thou
[2:06:53] this thing of thyself or did others tell
[2:06:56] it the of me Hallelujah they reasoning
[2:07:00] together pilate answered am I a
[2:07:03] Jew dine own nation and the chief priest
[2:07:06] have delivered thee unto me what hast
[2:07:08] thou
[2:07:09] done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[2:07:11] this world if my kingdom were of this
[2:07:13] world then would my servants fight that
[2:07:16] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[2:07:17] but now is my kingdom not from
[2:07:20] hence pilate therefore said unto him
[2:07:22] adou a king then Jesus answered thou say
[2:07:26] said I am a
