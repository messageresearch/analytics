we thank you for your presence Lord we need you tonight Lord we need your presence we need your love we need your power we need you to reveal unsure under us how to get out of the way that you might have the preeminence --is that you might have the oversight that we could be so yielded and surrendered to your father grab that father in Jesus name we ask it amen amen praise God Amen god bless you even get bad words are like a return to one portion of scripture tonight's in John chapter 15 we want to read from verse 1 to eat I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he take it away and every branch that bears fruit he Bridget it that in a bring forth more fruit now you are clean to the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch is withered men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hiren is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples may God bless rid of this word you may be seated mmm it's good to be here tonight it's always good to be in the presence of God and to be the hosts of God so I've a title tonight you are the branches that's a title tonight you are the branches you are the branches but a Branham from fundamental foundational feet message preached to teens of January 1955 and if Seaton by his power can make his laws work in man how much more God with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it how much more gore to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of divine healing revelation power gifts and manifestation of the Spirit the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of the liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things so I believe listen I believe this with all my heart I believe that we are nearly age when people are going to recognize these things we have had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until is accept the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the Word of God I have said faith does not come by fasting faith doesn't come by praying or reading a book all of that is good fasting praying reading a book but faith comes by a settled something in the human heart that tells you just as sure as you come to this church tonight when you come home you tell your wife you'll be home after services over you do that unconsciously you just go out and get in your car and you go home no you could you could not do it unless you have faith that you could do it you never move on where you're sitting thinking if you did not fit you could raise up but you've done those things so much you just become so accustomed to those laws nearly become a natural thing Oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you see it tonight so he is saying that the faith that supposed to come forth is an unconscious fee it's supposed to be part of your being you know God is able you know God is not dead you know he's gonna heal you you know you're gonna restore your family you're not worried you know you're gonna get your breakthrough praise God your faith declares it so you recognize know like the Leopards know have mercy upon me and Jesus said go and show yourself to the priest they walk in obedience and in obedience they were healed there wasn't baptized in Jesus name there wasn't in church they didn't get Bibles to read they just believed that this man had the power to release them from their condition and you have to believe that same thing tonight that God is here to release you from your condition we believe that tonight who prays godless let's go to what now if if we control ourselves completely to God and his will and be lost here we go to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in us them same operation of the Spirit would work to us just as natural things does because we were first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God did you hear that we were created to control to rule and to praise God that was the first commission that God deal man have dominion over conquer the sea conquer yet every creeping thing so you are a conqueror that's God's purpose you will build a rule that's why when men see them on Everest they just have taken it that man came up here they talk about difference they put the flag on company they look at how high dermal goodness I am man and I could conquer I was born for this even in a formal condition they know they could conquer or glory to God when polio came out man believing a conqueror to i'm-a-comin vaccine for polio vaccine for the period or glory Devon man is a conqueror we conquer the seas he conquer the air he cannot conquer space at all they were born to conquer we talking about fallen man what about the restored man what about a man came back in a channel of God or glory to God I believe that hallelujah hallelujah first we were first created I want you to take every word as God speaking directly to you when you hear it you said that I am created for this purpose whoa chlorine I got in another Church thing now this is an individual thing okay I already know because we were first created for that purpose the control to rule to praise God and to live for God know Jesus said I like that when Jesus saw the talk as a big thing jesus said if he abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Oh pouring of God hallelujah if he abide in me and my words abide in you oh god we trust' so much a humanistic and natural hoping this work or than that work hard and there's so much power in the word right here you could acts whatever you will and it shall be done unto you all he asked for you Abidin for you remaining is that right but abandon continue though the father and his word is inseparable cuz the word is his son in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us God and His Word is inseparable you cannot have God without having his word and when you have his word you have God give the Lord a shout so you see when the Parabellum says when the Holy Spirit call him become a tenant write and say the secret is the word is in the pride that's God in the bride that's true their perfection the capstone worth working its way out God put the word in you I know the word in you put the work its way out I am the vine and you are the branches Oh hallelujah what bears fruit the branches bears the fruit ok let's continue now hallelujah so if you want to go back a little further just as far as historical you could see the word in the beginning was the word and what is the word a word is a sort manifested a word is a thought spoken for so a word is actually a manifestation of a thought so God thought it and God spoke it and then I catch the word no and that is what in the beginning but before the beginning was God's thought which is this main which is the intelligence of God hallelujah so after man fell that ports of God wants to be Redeemer to be Savior you know man go get sick to be a healer or glory to God to be a Baptizer evil man go need power come on now so he come to be a Baptizer you know you're not caught matter so he will be a lawyer he will be a doctor whatever you have need of he gonna be whatever you have lead up all these was the thoughts of God so when Jesus came he said I am the door I am the way I am the truth he was the iron man I am whatever you want me to be that is what I am or glory of God and when Jesus spoke that way he was expressing what the I am who spoke to Moses when they say who shall I say sent me or Gloria tell em I am a up or glory to God hallelujah praise God so you I will get up employment tonight is that not next week tonight you will get our empowerment from the word itself because the word itself is God all these years the devil making people feel the world is just letter but the word is God or give the Lord a shout the word is God [Applause] Amen so what a word is a thought manifested I thought spoken for so first he perceives the thought then spoke it and it became a word and then the word listen became material let there be light thought will let there be light manifestation and there was light or glory to God let the earth bring forth thought would spoken then he would bring forth or glory to God are you with me now so everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel like tonight will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is Claude will do it he is obligated to it now we are getting into principles that will step you into a manifestation the world received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he is obligated and then if he abandoned me here we go I'm I was abiding you then you have brought the world in you and you believe the world just as I believe God because it is gone do you understand no white Jesus after why he says away but my word will never pass away he was so locked up in the thoughts of God whatever you see has to come to pass and the bride will be put in that very same position that's why the Prophet said the world will hear direct from God because God's going to be sailing a bride when the bride speaks is God speaking when the great move its course moving or chlorine of God God dressing himself in the form of a brain [Music] now Jesus said whatever you ask the Father in my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means do you realize if we call before God in the name of Jesus it is just the same as Jesus himself prayin is a big one tonight you could take that one and put that in your pocket and run it up tonight let's go put one tonight did you hear that that was reason again he said Jesus said whatever you ask the Father in my name that will I do he said did you ever realize what that means do you realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if I communist them and he recognizes them and Jesus said whatever you ask the Father in my name that is what I'm gonna do then when I go to the Father in Jesus name it isn't me brain anymore it is Jesus it is his spirit praying through me [Music] and then I have got to receive for the axe for because he said it and it's God's own word it can't do nothing else but produce what God said so then we believe this is the confidence that we haven't gone so afterwards you're not hoping so you're not wondering so you have a confidence that when you have the assurance of faith in your heart you have the confidence no kind of a function or go dead hallelujah they have like I got permission to interfere with you oh yes he can Russia but he can overcome you can fight with you but he can't over your roll on the floor get all get here but he still let that fall but you'll get back up or go read a book because greater is He that's in you [Applause] Lu's job Lou's wife whose husband lose children lose health it doesn't matter when Joe gets shut down in his health job come to the spot we said honesty worms destroy my buddy listen listen heavy punishment delegate yet in my flesh he watch it watch it dies off Fitness talk yet in my flesh I shall see God for myself and ask him somebody else you see God for me I'm gonna she go for myself that's when feet thought I take a whole and when face I'll take a whole upon you in your life which I've chosen it's a tonight hallelujah your whole action and life become the action of faith and that's where you're getting the substance feet and that's maybe coming in too bright material hallelujah don't care what his senses tell you they don't care what sealants tell you feelings lying to begin with hallelujah senses lying to you once it doesn't declare the word is alight every more than when Abram ricknelsie Sarah is a Lionel Sarah all bodies alight Abraham his feet wasn't staggering because you know that had to change that class a so is 25 years he waited so after 20 years he woman more wrinkled than before after 20 years is more wrinkles on Iran watch them wrinkles and see transformation they take real theater new retina and the quad calmly father of fate you know the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God but Syria no serious trouble that she self because she didn't get a revelation and squat and talk to her but ever ham got the promise or give the Lord a show and when God give you a promise doesn't matter what he wants it what the neighbors say what the boss said if God give your promise Court can't light has to bring us a pass he is not a man that with light or glory of God hallelujah you realize what happened look at Cena do kf8 you know after what you don't get nothing if a script will come you're praying because you don't care to police nothing I just part of what we do sons of God has healed the sick son does brother raise the dead sons of God has cast out Devils this is what we do this is what we live [Music] yeah Missy said Hollywood Holly will have to put men and do computer gimmicks to make them fly I made them Superman I put a big s on his chest and what kind of fancy thing to make them look like they acted I set up Dino Realty walking like this home here oh I know Europe Dino hero if you wanna talk about heroes yeah I go to Hebrews 11 that guy's heroes if you want to talk about heroes you have to go into Hebrews 11 by faith Noah I suggest I - Samsung real heroes or glory to God amen all right he has confidence that we get what we asked for for He is God he cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word then if he abided me my words abide in you ask what you will and we've given to you mr. Byrne is not simple faith created we was made for that purpose then true the fall why we was taken away from that then in Redemption we was brought back to it again and the only thing that hindered the human race today from being superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up now all the wiring is there but it cooked up if you puke on a water just unplug and you see God at a diner rewire your mind you start with a main force to rewire your mind to change your thinking as to who you are and who you are what you will restore for let's continue sometimes I say this reverently sometimes theology and church doctrine have clogged up your feet line this thing is real this thing is so presented theology and doctrine have clogged up your feet line clogged up your lines till you have been taught that those things can't be and it puts up blocking the way that's why in America the Bharata fight the up thing faith and talk ego in India thirty thousand people one L miracle and began healing or cutting why they have no theology one little thing the see one time a man come out blind blind worship me son and man be a foot first thing where I'm doing a take off his shoes to see the bunch you could fit him pick up the man shoes thanks how it is I don't feel for the person then he say how many people would save Jesus and God give this sight back to this buying man any man see and so much people give their hands after the Lord one miracle and their faith rise take the healing Oh glory to God and sold Africa after he pray for the whole bunch of crippled and whatnot he went back to the hotel and afterwards all night long the angel of God among the people good political next a big truck load our wheelchairs and crutches and everybody walking on a wheelchair you mean we can't have that you have to want that you have to have a desire to see the supernatural everyone want a nice minister a nice fast a nice teacher a nice explainer they could get that too we had over fifty plus years but see what God's saying here tonight so sometime okay could you imagine is building here being energized tonight for light by the electricity electricity is an unseen force when it is harness and brought on Benjamin Franklin he screamed I've got it he didn't know what he had but along come Edison and put it to work or glory to God so this base could be in darkness yet it have like all along you have to put the wire and get the connection to get olicity the cars in the city you can't see us DC but you could see if the velocity should we have light you have a condition and so on because I suppose Saturday no but I'm really bringing a point he said no watch we are Wireless telegram from right this place there anywhere around the world by wireless telegram an unseen force move the to space that no man can catch only machinery can catch it because it's too fast for the eye yet there's a force that's these these telegrams coming right here now no here we go if the natural laws of God which is election things once handed the right capacity can do those things how much more could the power of the Holy Ghost once passion to the human at my feet what it could do now God has not promised us election city only just might have set them free but look what the Holy Spirit has promised to the believers today when we look back and see that God put Alisha see here for a season thing and science is moving into the field of science and bringing it out remember everything you see here it has always been here in science corner and bring it out where there was driving the horse and buggy chariots and things M chance you wheel and the wheel and they spit on you how they just discovered yet they hard wheel the odd horse but God is here if you only know what man was going to develop after all the material is steel the metal or whatever it is or was always here on the man is not aqueous at the creating out of nothing he take what God put assemble it together you have car airplane computer piano organ guitar is man making things by taking stuff that's already here now we have over 1100 books and messages from a prophet in the desert of voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to song all the material is in the books all the materials in the tape and they're gonna take some spiritual scientists to put things together to get that different product we have to have a new product for this age ordinary faith can't work it will take rapture in faith so whatever we mix in and mix it what are we flipping on sliding whatever we put in you including here at the end of the day have to produce your actual faith or we won't go or get the Lord a shout glory of God did you get that all right let's continue hallelujah praise God watch science moving out in the field and bringing it oh but we as Christians we become too clogged up we just can't understand we think but the doctor said I can't get well as long as you think that you are not thinking go to the doctor say you can't get well that's inside the challenging doctor because the doctor says oh thanks that God says so doctors that God you need quarter talk okay the Lord a shout the doctor saying his best you see well I'm going to die your doctor said I was going to die oh all we gossiped his doctor that's the best of his knowledge now if he said you were going to die humanly speaking I believe the same thing but by the word I believe it that's right because he promised me whatever acts the Father in his name would be granted I believe that truth now if God could just clear that little channel out and run that energy out to that place something after the whole body is set together to operate and is that just a show and it takes every memory way to operate and gives me life so that it takes and remember the body of Christ to operate together to get it right Somerset's in the Church teaches apostles prophets gifts of healing miracles speaker madtown's interpretation and so forth all those things in this one great mystic body of Jesus Christ moving on the earth on Sunday I believe and I believe it's near at hand right now just like tonight in this light and that light he has given up little swing the role of our younger run that way over there that material when the energy goes into that wire it will produce just exactly like it was here and I believe a lot of times when the wiring up of God spiritual but in the earth I see this reverently to the Letitia the prominence all right we can't save them by water that's the only thing about this Odyssey if this body is correctly wired up and the father heaven turns on the big master switch so you don't know the promised wish all of this the body wired up and the big mark in the father heaven turns on the master on something is what the rise up if the body if the building is properly wired if properly taught every fiber or body being lost in Christ look if you got theology if you've got some doctrine if you got some superstition if they got some unbelief you've got something that stops up somewhere then the energy can never pull through you but when you get to a place where you are perfectly wired and the master electrician has okayed it by sealing it with the Holy Spirit a [Music] master electrician to finish running wires on your hands and when inspector come you feel it you need a qualified decision or glory regard all right but when you got a place where you're perfectly wild and the Massey logician has okayed it by sealing it by the Holy Spirit the only thing is just a tender switch then and there will be a light show and yeah the light of the world a city that set on a hill that cannot be hid and tonight we ought to be ashamed of ourselves and honestly and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us of how we represent him in this life he is dependent on us I know you think you are dependent on him but he tonight yeah the branches and the vine here we go is dependent upon the branch to produce fruit you hear you have a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation tonight I want you to see a certain picture I want you to see yourself as very important to the vine as the branch Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus our let's continue all right the Old Testament did not have this presence you are aware of that amazing again the Old Testament people did not have this presence your way of that you refer back sometimes Elijah to Moses to those people Moses Elijah and those people were great men ordained of God but yet not the privilege that you have they haven't the privilege they did not have the power given them to perform as you have got yourself this something like a whole new set of mysteries are fully in Italy they did not have the power given them to perform as you have got yourself because everything that's in Christ for therefore shortest day and embraced it and believed it and look for it to come before it ever come and now we are living right in it and I'm afraid of it what a privilege now if sees and body can be operated by unbelief and don'ts and fears will produce what what the scripture says is will it produce sickness it produces after it put is all these things then people buy under even produce that shouldn't people by believing but the power of God harness these things and bring them back to correction now how you suppose I see yourself tonight as a believer you another unbeliever sitting here tonight you are believing in the night and guess what these signs shall follow them so it should not be a surprise to our shock of the miracles and wonders about you around your life or glory the board no shock about that because you begin to recognize itself as a believer recommending self as a branch that Jesus need you he's depending upon you I am the vine and you are the branches Oh glory love God hallelujah hallelujah I need you the same energy the energy come from the finest of the branch so you're not here to make up numbers you were here to be energized [Applause] all right let me go for less this is getting better Oh glory to God amen going good what did Christ redeem us for did you ever think what he redeem us for why didn't he just make you the atonement and say there's no need of giving them deep power there was no need and making this man a sort of son of God there's no need in doing that I was just ask him to believe it and write his name in the book of heaven and that settle it but he gave us he gave us these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit then he was break in description on st. John 15 I am the vine ye are the branches do you know that the vine can't be a fruit although the fruit is in the vine that's the the fruit is in the Fang but the Fang kind of been through hallelujah but the fruit cannot be brought forth from a file it has to have a branch to be a fruit and you are the branches there was no fruit with on you or give the Lord a shotgun back how do you feel about that tonight he's depending upon the branch to produce fruit oh god we get caught tonight or glory to God you get caught tonight you are going to be a living moving monument you are gonna be a tabernacle robust and living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place all glory hallelujah you are the branches no divine with all of its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy so if I want to push out but if the branch can't receive it how will the food be produced you have to have the energy and you have to receive the energy or glory of God are you with me now let's continue are you ready are you ready tonight God is depending on you as a member of his body to be a fruit of his spirit no if he is dependent on you let's open our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts and a revival come [Music] [Applause] what holding back remember is fearsome dose because what promises work I like Oh glory to God God promised signs and wonders written witnesses listen the Apostles had great witness of the Spirit confirm the Ministry of the Apostles there wasn't talking about the left hand world there was a confirmation I was here they believed that someone said the power has only given the apostles of those things I am a historian but I've read much history of the church history I've never seen a time in all the history of the world where there was ever was the wheels of the Holy Ghost ever struck the church with out a revival but what sign then one of the miracles followed it the ones the Holy Ghost strikes the church they've got to have a wave of signs and wonders America this is no singing revival this not given notebooks of [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord Oh all right let me read it again in all history of the world where there ever was the ways of the Holy Ghost ever struck the church we don't a revival but what sign that one is Americans following God heal the sick in every age I will continue to do it in every age where people and churches are willing to let loose and let the Holy Spirit take control of their being you have to be willing to let God be the boss let God be in charge let God rule and reign and get your fresh out of the way get your thinking out of the way get your toes out of the way and you do what the spirit see do hallelujah Martin Luther prayed for one of his close companions and he was healed John Wesley I believe it was recorded 240 cases generally praying for the sick and they were healed when he was riding his horse his horse was lean and him with a headache and no board he bought him and the horse the horse crept LibDem [Music] [Applause] under two mu D Sankey fini all those men when waves of the horsemen move across the church there was signs and wonders one of them one time he said I believe was Moody there was so many people that had been healed in the meetin while the whole Smith was falling although moody didn't teach a doctrine of divine healing but he said there was so much healing taking place and his meetin he taught his church would turn into a cathedral like the place in France where they come down to be healed so many people being healed testifying of how the holy spirit even without being taught divine healing the Holy Spirit will do it himself if he can get the right it reproduce it so I don't see no reason why you can't be here tonight tonight [Music] could you take some more is the word going deep inside I have seen people who just couldn't even come for

that's a deeply no when you get the other gift then the will becomes a conductor if God gives you the give of the Holy Ghost you believe that where the Word of God is a conductor to use that power it whatever the Holy was promised you that is what you can do when when the angel came to Mary Hail Mary know highly favored Lord is with thee blessed are all my woman Mary only and blessings Lord is with her she have no confirmation of that the angel taught to believe the angel shadow everything said that she's just you know ordinary little girl she has no evidence that she believed the angel may we have no confirmation marry young 2015 16 years old confusion for the desert she's doing her normal choice but her name is on that book her name is in the world approaching shall conceive Isaiah 9:6 she's written there so any angel tell her that she will conceive and so on she only had one question she received it were there any only one question whom shall these things be he said that he said the Holy Ghost could overshadow you and the world already in you is a conductor of the Spirit to bring to pass the very word I promise of a virgin shall conceive that was the seed that was Mary seed nor a woman could hold that or give the Lord a show and the bright seed of seven thunders no other oven Nora Church no other people but all that or get the Lord a show tonight mysteries have been

packed here move yet he like every driver he inside a woman but here move yet or chlorine of God Zakaria problems gone after silencing but but but but man but unless the video movie when Mary got that inspiration she didn't walk she ran without a feelin without feeling pregnant without feelin emotions she ran because she believed you have to believe this is it you have to believe we in the revival you have to believe me pushing on the dynamics well Mary caught the inspiration she ran to her cousin and summer baby no evidence no testimony TLC doctor she had no confirmation but be she take for

different faith or give the Lord a shout in the house the fear for what to pull on the power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right help me Jesus all right listen listen if God give you the gift of the Holy Ghost you pretty bad well the Word of God is a conductor to use that power wit and whatever the Holy Ghost promised that is what you can do now to see the thing that delivers the word the word goes right out right and the Holy Spirit follows the word wherever the word is preached you see your pastor preach it the first thing I know he works he blows up across the building cause the Holy Ghost because it's the conductor of the word the word is the conductor of the Spirit so if I come and I set up dreams tonight no holy spit coming little dreams and coming to new ideas and I get thought and paint magazine have this and you speak of this under the papers of the Express not this and ecaddy I'm saying that no spirit passing through that it has to be the word or glories of God the word as a conductor the spirit so that's right we feel we can't preach because we cotton but I am Reverend son years ago that this is the conductor and when people begin to see the fire move to them coach and the fire moved to that world because this world is in you be then said by these promises that is why we are come to preach what revealed become the peace promises we given you promises tonight you are the branches that's a promise to produce fruit listen we not open this co-op you know we know this for happily enough if he abide in me and my words abide in you

up in there you were inside of you and you inside of him he's a doctor you shall know I'm in the Father he with me are you sittin cabbie feet that can tell us that or glory of God God is gonna make you a live wire it's it's untouchable get shock power inside of you and then she flew inside of you the word is a conductor of the Spirit because when the word is preached the spirit follows it wherever it goes the spirit follows the world all the way from the book of redemption the spirit follows the blood so when that will becomes blood you have the spirit atmosphere because without blood there is no spirit there's no presence there's this intellectual but blood needs your sacrifice what means you you you actually connect with the atonement or glory of God and the life of your blood the life of your opponent the spirit come back upon you as I worship herself oh wow and the message will quiet the big ocean of profit no worship no no atmosphere no atmosphere because there's no blood day they don't actually have knocks about the fullness of the atonement so there's no blood dear as long as there's no blood there's no atmosphere I'm long as there's an atmosphere a possibility there's then all glory that God of a healing of a deliverance of your ceiling woe unto us if we have not a cuisine here tonight go home we start I'm coming to church if there's no atmosphere we listen
