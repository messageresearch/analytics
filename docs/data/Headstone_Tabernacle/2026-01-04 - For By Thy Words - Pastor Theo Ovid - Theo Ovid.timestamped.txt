[1:01:18] Now
[1:01:20] I know
[1:01:23] he touched me
[1:01:27] and made
[1:01:30] me go.
[1:01:33] You can have your seat.
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:46] Hallelujah.
[1:01:53] Heat. Heat.
[1:02:08] Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:18] The prophet said that one day we'll be
[1:02:20] standing talking and love will just come
[1:02:22] into the building and all that's wrong
[1:02:24] will be taken out. Just think about it.
[1:02:28] A day we just worship cuz that's what
[1:02:31] this is all about. Come back into
[1:02:33] fellowship with Jehovah.
[1:02:35] Coming back in fellowship with God.
[1:02:37] Hallelujah. A love that passes
[1:02:40] knowledge. A love that passes on all
[1:02:43] understanding. So it's not knowledge
[1:02:45] then. It's not information then. All
[1:02:47] what you know have in your intellect.
[1:02:50] But the love of God beating on your
[1:02:51] soul.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It will take love to enter there.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; That's a higher level. That's beyond
[1:02:57] words. That's the power of love. The
[1:03:00] power of forgiveness. the power of
[1:03:01] reconciliation.
[1:03:03] That's what God promised in us last
[1:03:04] night. There'll be one more ride.
[1:03:07] There'll be one more expression of God
[1:03:09] love to the earth. That's why the
[1:03:11] revelation 22:7, the spirit and the
[1:03:13] bride say come. Come because there's the
[1:03:16] door is still open. Come because we has
[1:03:19] been made. Come because there's blood
[1:03:21] available for you and your family. Come
[1:03:24] because you don't know his height and
[1:03:26] the width and the depth of his love. And
[1:03:28] the spirit in the bride say come. One of
[1:03:31] these days it wouldn't be man speaking.
[1:03:32] It would be God speaking. It would be
[1:03:34] the spirit speaking expressly because
[1:03:37] you become the word and the spirit come
[1:03:39] upon you to express and manifest the
[1:03:41] word.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Time here is so fleeting.
[1:03:45] The did a funeral service. I was telling
[1:03:47] them that a thousand years is as one
[1:03:49] day. How do you think 70 years look like
[1:03:52] in God's eyes? I think about that. If a
[1:03:56] thousand years is as one day, 70 years
[1:03:59] like a That's how you come and go.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Oh, 70 years that old."
[1:04:05] And to God's mind, sh
[1:04:08] that's that's how we going out of here.
[1:04:09] Born and exit. 70 years gone.
[1:04:13] Seconds, that's out.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And every day somebody is gone. Somebody
[1:04:17] born and every day so many are sealed
[1:04:20] into the kingdom of God.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; The brother say one day the last drop in
[1:04:24] the bucket. This is the part now where
[1:04:26] you have to be concerned about you
[1:04:28] getting part of that. What's in that
[1:04:29] pocket?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; You want that.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; You don't want church. You want God.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; You don't want church, you want a
[1:04:35] reality.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; You want the kingdom of God. Here we
[1:04:40] have a fellowship one way or another.
[1:04:41] But the kingdom is by one spirit. You
[1:04:44] are baptized into that body. We have no
[1:04:47] hold in place for you. We have no refuge
[1:04:50] place for you. But God has that.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; That's his kingdom. And the kingdom is
[1:04:54] not in meat and drink. It's is in the
[1:04:56] word and power. It's a spiritual
[1:04:58] kingdom. Takes you off the natural.
[1:05:01] Takes you out your humanistic realm.
[1:05:03] Take the take you out the realm of your
[1:05:05] family. All your family circle and what
[1:05:07] your family feel and what your family
[1:05:08] think and and how you move and you take
[1:05:10] you out of all of that
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; into a realm where you see what God
[1:05:14] wants done because Jesus was completely
[1:05:16] out of family. You know who is my
[1:05:18] mother? Who's my father? Them that do
[1:05:20] the will of God. They are my mother, my
[1:05:21] brother. You see what I'm talking about
[1:05:23] now? Who is your mother? Who is your
[1:05:24] father? Who your mother? Who is your
[1:05:26] father? You'll give her new family, give
[1:05:28] her new friends. Oh, blessed be. What a
[1:05:31] time.
[1:05:33] I have a greetings here, a testimony.
[1:05:35] Greetings, saints. I'd like to give uh
[1:05:37] the Lord Jesus a high note of praise for
[1:05:39] divine intervention and protection on
[1:05:42] our way from church on New Year's
[1:05:43] morning. We turned on the highway to
[1:05:46] Santa Rosa to take Sister Carmen home.
[1:05:48] Then a vehicle broke the red light,
[1:05:51] speeding up the highway. And I know it
[1:05:53] was the angel of the Lord that stopped
[1:05:56] brother Sabu. I shudder to think what
[1:05:59] could have happened as my entire family
[1:06:01] was there with me. If the angel of the
[1:06:03] Lord was not if the angel of the Lord
[1:06:05] was not on duty but mercy said no. May
[1:06:07] God continue to bless and protect us
[1:06:09] this new year. Sister Sabu. Oh, praise
[1:06:12] the Lord.
[1:06:14] So when the Sab was telling me about it,
[1:06:16] when he got the green to go go and he
[1:06:18] and he was going to go, he saw that car
[1:06:20] and something tell him stop.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; When my children got a license, I I used
[1:06:29] to teach them and tell them I said
[1:06:30] you're not driving for them, you know,
[1:06:31] don't get um dead in the right your
[1:06:34] right way and and they get killed
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; because you had the right way.
[1:06:39] You don't want that. When I see the
[1:06:41] light, I don't go. Red means stop and
[1:06:43] watch.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Then you go.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You're watching green and you're going
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; some demon coming on that side there.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Take you out, you know.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Said not yet, Satan.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be wise on this earth.
[1:06:58] You can't walk stupid. You can't walk
[1:07:00] foolish. You have to walk with wisdom.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, brother Andrew.
[1:07:06] Brother Andrew Luin is here with his
[1:07:07] wife. God bless you, Pastor Luan. and
[1:07:09] his wife. God bless you. He and his wife
[1:07:11] visit us this morning. Be glad to have
[1:07:13] them. Praise God. And last year was an
[1:07:17] amazing year for us, this church. And we
[1:07:19] want to see what the Lord will do this
[1:07:21] coming year. We had services that we
[1:07:23] didn't think we would have. We had
[1:07:25] amazing services, amazing time, and and
[1:07:28] God sent his tremendous blessing. And we
[1:07:30] certainly appreciate all of you here and
[1:07:33] those who connect to us live internet
[1:07:34] both locally and overseas. We say God
[1:07:37] bless you all. And we have a big salute
[1:07:39] for all of them. Praise God.
[1:07:43] We are greatly encouraged by all the
[1:07:45] different testimonies. I heard some uh a
[1:07:47] couple from Australia actually connect
[1:07:49] to us and and and listen to our services
[1:07:51] and so on. So it's quite interesting. I
[1:07:54] know years ago I share with a precious
[1:07:56] brother of mine that long before we had
[1:07:58] all this internet connect connection. I
[1:08:00] was telling them I was seeing a church
[1:08:02] without walls in the future. A church
[1:08:05] where there's no wall barrier. And I'm
[1:08:08] seeing that even more possible now where
[1:08:10] God is not uh confined by a building, by
[1:08:13] a man, by a church, by whatever. God
[1:08:16] does what he wants to do. And he want to
[1:08:18] do something special for you this
[1:08:19] morning. So could we stand? We want to
[1:08:21] go to the word. Joshua chapter 14. Want
[1:08:23] to read verse 6 and 7. We just have to
[1:08:26] it. Matthew chapter 12 uh 33-37.
[1:08:31] John chapter 1 1-5 and 11-13.
[1:08:35] I read this out like that in case you
[1:08:37] want to write it down. Joshua chapter 14
[1:08:40] reading it from verse 6. Then the
[1:08:42] children of Judah
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; came unto Joshua and Gigel and Caleb the
[1:08:46] son of Jeff the Kesanite said unto him,
[1:08:49] "Thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[1:08:51] said unto Moses, the man of God
[1:08:53] concerning me, and indeed in Kenish
[1:08:55] Bania, 40 years old was I when Moses,
[1:08:58] the servant of the Lord, sent me from
[1:09:01] Kenesh Bania to espire the land. and I
[1:09:04] brought him word again as it was in my
[1:09:08] heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that
[1:09:09] bent up with me made the heart of the
[1:09:11] people to melt, but I wholly follow the
[1:09:15] Lord. Matthew chapter 12, Jesus speaks
[1:09:19] from verse 33.
[1:09:23] Either make the tree good and his food
[1:09:26] good, or else make the tree corrupt and
[1:09:28] his food corrupt. For the tree is known
[1:09:31] by his fruit. Oh ye generation of
[1:09:33] vipers, how can you being evil speak
[1:09:35] good things? For out of the abundance of
[1:09:39] the heart, the mouth speaketh. A good
[1:09:43] man out of the good treasure of the
[1:09:46] heart bringeth forth good things. And an
[1:09:49] evil man
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
[1:09:53] evil things. But I say unto you, that
[1:09:56] every idle word that men shall speak,
[1:10:00] they shall give account thereof in the
[1:10:02] day of judgment. For by thy words thou
[1:10:06] shalt be justified,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; and by thy words thou shalt be
[1:10:11] condemned. St. John 1 1:5 and then we go
[1:10:15] on to 11-13.
[1:10:17] In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:10:19] was with God and the word was God. The
[1:10:22] same was in the beginning with God. All
[1:10:25] things were made by him, and without him
[1:10:27] was not anything made that was made. In
[1:10:30] him was life, and the life was the light
[1:10:32] of men. And the light shineth in the
[1:10:34] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[1:10:37] it not. Let's go down to verse 11. He
[1:10:40] came unto his own, his own receive him
[1:10:42] not. But as many as receive him, to them
[1:10:46] give he power to become the sons of God,
[1:10:49] even to them that believe on his name,
[1:10:51] which were born not of blood, nor of the
[1:10:53] will of the flesh, nor of the will of
[1:10:55] man, but of God. Let's pray. Father, we
[1:10:57] thank you for your word this morning,
[1:10:58] and I pray to inspire our hearts and
[1:11:01] change and transform our lives. May they
[1:11:04] see the weight of the word tonight in
[1:11:07] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless
[1:11:09] you. May have your seat and just give
[1:11:10] him some praises while you sit down.
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:18] Now you realize we will say give him a
[1:11:20] shout, give him a praise, sit down and
[1:11:21] praise because we are going against the
[1:11:24] grain. You know
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; the grain is no praise.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; The grain is that no praise demon and
[1:11:29] that demon sitting up upon your top lip
[1:11:31] that you don't want to open God and give
[1:11:32] God praise. But the Bible say let
[1:11:34] everything that have breath give the
[1:11:35] Lord give the Lord praise and thanks. In
[1:11:37] the good times you praise him. In the
[1:11:39] bad times you praise him. Praise God.
[1:11:42] You praise him anyhow. You praise him
[1:11:44] anyway. They were in the upper room
[1:11:46] praising and blessing his name. The
[1:11:48] purpose they creating an atmosphere. In
[1:11:50] order to praise God, you're sitting on
[1:11:52] your flesh hearing words. But when you
[1:11:54] praise God, you create an atmosphere.
[1:11:56] That atmosphere is what comes around
[1:11:58] you. That atmosphere is what the prophet
[1:12:00] identify. The pillar of fire is over
[1:12:02] this woman here. Let the spirit the
[1:12:03] spirit moving inside of there. Praise
[1:12:05] God. He's identifying an atmosphere. In
[1:12:08] that atmosphere, you get you get you get
[1:12:10] your healing. In that atmosphere, you
[1:12:12] get your breakthrough. In that
[1:12:13] atmosphere, you get the deliverance.
[1:12:15] Listen, you don't even have to be a
[1:12:17] believer to be healed. Praise God. The
[1:12:19] atmosphere of faith produces healing. A
[1:12:22] sinner could walk in here and be healed
[1:12:24] and walk out with your healing. Give the
[1:12:26] Lord a shout. Do you hear amen in the
[1:12:29] house? It don't have TO BE NO MESSAGE
[1:12:31] PERSON. WHAT MESSAGE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[1:12:33] God message is the message of faith.
[1:12:36] Give the Lord a shout. He sent a PROPHET
[1:12:37] TO TURN YOUR HEARTS BACK TO the faith OF
[1:12:39] THE FATHERS. NOT FOR YOU TO sit in your
[1:12:41] stinking flesh. Don't get me started
[1:12:44] this morning. Already started. Oh, give
[1:12:46] the Lord some praises.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:12:52] Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Some of you not asking big enough.
[1:13:00] Asking big enough,
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; asking too small.
[1:13:05] You see, in terms of determination,
[1:13:06] ambition,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; goals and so on, you can't set it too
[1:13:10] low
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; because you wouldn't have the drive.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You have to set it not too high that you
[1:13:15] can achieve it,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; but you have to have it somewhere above
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; where you are that you could press.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Paul can't press it be the goal right
[1:13:25] there. You're not pressing, you're
[1:13:26] walking into it.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; But the reason you say I press towards,
[1:13:30] it means it's a far off. It means it
[1:13:33] have some distance to cut to get there.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; It means you have some obstacles
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; to get there,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; but you're going there.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I wasn't a fast learner, but
[1:13:45] praise God. Once I get something in my
[1:13:47] heart to go after, you can't stop me
[1:13:49] from that.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, have to come in
[1:13:52] your heart.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; A lot of things are in people's heart. A
[1:13:58] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; all his ways.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Not some, all because you're
[1:14:04] double-minded.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. They may say, "My heart is
[1:14:07] fixed." Oh, God, my heart is fixed.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; You have to have purpose. You have to
[1:14:11] have a fixed heart to go after the goals
[1:14:14] of God. If God promised a revival, we
[1:14:16] fixed on that. He called it have name.
[1:14:19] He have a name for it. Not just revival.
[1:14:21] Have a seven thunder revival. He
[1:14:23] identified THE NAME OF IT. OKAY. GIVE
[1:14:25] THE Lord a shout. NOTICE ANY REVIVAL. WE
[1:14:27] NOT TALKING ABOUT REVIVAL. REVIVAL.
[1:14:29] ANYBODY COULD TALK THAT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE
[1:14:30] TALKING ABOUT BRIGHT REVIVAL, YOU'RE
[1:14:32] TALKING ABOUT SEVEN THUNDERS. OH, give
[1:14:34] the Lord a shout in the house. No other
[1:14:36] church could preach THAT BUT THE BRIGHT
[1:14:39] CHURCH.
[1:14:41] BECAUSE THAT'S A EXCLUSIVE BRIGHT
[1:14:43] PROMISE. YOU could take vials, WARS,
[1:14:47] UKRAINE, AND RUSSIA WITH YOU, BUT YOU
[1:14:49] CAN'T TOUCH THEM THUNDERS. OH, GIVE THE
[1:14:51] LORD A SHOUT. THAT'S THE BRIDE'S
[1:14:52] REVIVAL. THAT'S GIVE THE BRIDE'S FAITH.
[1:14:55] THAT SHOW THE BRIDE HOW TO BE PURE. OH,
[1:14:57] give the LORD A SHOUT. WAIT TILL THEM
[1:14:59] SEVEN THUNDERS UTTER THE VOICES OF THAT
[1:15:01] GROUP.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I can't move from that. You know
[1:15:07] that's the word.
[1:15:10] I understand all that. You don't have
[1:15:11] to. You know when you go in the bank, I
[1:15:14] remember long time when they first come
[1:15:16] with this um card machine. This machine
[1:15:17] to put in your card ATM. People was
[1:15:20] wondering if it's a man behind you
[1:15:21] throwing on the money.
[1:15:25] Now we know we're just pushing but you
[1:15:27] don't know how it working.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You know the mechanics of that. You're
[1:15:30] pushing a card. You're punching a number
[1:15:32] and you press and money come out here.
[1:15:35] Put in your pocket.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Who behind who the teller behind that?
[1:15:41] That comes sister when the first uh
[1:15:44] search in Google she asked if Google is
[1:15:45] a man or woman.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Who who doing that behind that?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that is where we are at.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have to know the mechanics,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; but you have to know the dynamics of it.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to know all THE PARTS
[1:16:03] INSIDE THE CAR, BUT when you turn the
[1:16:04] knot,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; let that car start, you know,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; because you ain't going nowhere.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And this is the thing
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him, you shall receive power
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Not when Peter talk to you,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; not when James expresses mysteries to
[1:16:19] you, but after the Holy Ghost. And those
[1:16:22] men were not responsible for the Holy
[1:16:24] Ghost. HOLY GHOST WAS A PROMISE OF THE
[1:16:26] FATHER. GOD IS THE ONE with responsible.
[1:16:29] They couldn't have it when they want it.
[1:16:32] They had to get it when he release it.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tar, until."
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's all they know. Until. What you
[1:16:38] going to do when he say until? Are you
[1:16:40] going to get frustrated when he say
[1:16:42] until? Are you GOING TO GET FED UP AND
[1:16:44] YOU CAN'T CARE NO MORE AND YOU CAN'T
[1:16:46] TAKE IT NO MORE? OR YOU GOING TO HOLD ON
[1:16:47] THERE AND HANG IN THERE? This is power
[1:16:50] to overcome. This is power to pray. This
[1:16:52] is power to forgive. This is power to
[1:16:54] make things right. THIS IS POWER, POWER,
[1:16:57] POWER, power coming upon you. All what
[1:16:59] you can't overcome. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:17:01] SHOUT. POWER COME TO YOU. GIVE
[1:17:03] overcoming power. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:17:05] SHOUT. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR.
[1:17:08] THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD FOR.
[1:17:10] YOU WALK BY FAITH, YOU TALK BY FAITH,
[1:17:12] BUT POWER COMING. OH, GIVE the Lord a
[1:17:15] shout.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] Praise God. Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; So have a title.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; For by thy words.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's the title.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Bible say for thy by by thy words thou
[1:17:30] shalt be justified.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Or for by thy words shall be condemned.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? God want
[1:17:37] your words.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Not your thoughts,
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; not your mind,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; but he wants something to come out your
[1:17:44] mouth.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; What you will say.
[1:17:47] So Caleb said it this way. I brought
[1:17:50] word
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; as it was in
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; my heart.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration as it was in my
[1:17:59] heart.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Words.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Words are powerful.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Because words could cross through time
[1:18:07] and space.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; A man could put his words in text and
[1:18:13] you could read it.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. and you are translated into what
[1:18:17] he's expressing in text.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; You could actually break into another
[1:18:21] world with words.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible does.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; When you read the Bible,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; you get transported
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; By the words that you read,
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; that's the power of words.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Words can create.
[1:18:44] Words can bring healing.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Words can bring restoration.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Words can heal.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Words can destroy.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Words can justify.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And words can condemn.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; There are people and is known something
[1:19:01] that is factual with unforgiveness
[1:19:05] producing cancer and tumor and all kind
[1:19:06] of different things because they have
[1:19:08] ought in their system. And the os that
[1:19:11] they have in their heart get translated
[1:19:13] into whatever crystals or whatever
[1:19:15] something in their body physically.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; It has been documented that people who
[1:19:20] forgive how their system changes
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; and how healing is released
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; because of forgiveness.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; So I am saying to you sometimes what you
[1:19:30] think happening in the natural is more
[1:19:32] than in the natural.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; So words are not just natural.
[1:19:38] And I could prove it to you because
[1:19:40] Jesus said my words
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; are spirit
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; and my words
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; are life.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; So words have spirit in it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Positive or negative.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; St. John 663 is a spirit that quick. The
[1:20:00] flesh profitth nothing. The words that I
[1:20:02] speak unto you, they are spirit and they
[1:20:05] life. But Abraham said this the other
[1:20:08] night I was dreaming. I went to have
[1:20:09] discernment and a great host of my
[1:20:11] friend had gathered thousands of them in
[1:20:13] a meeting. There was a fellow come up
[1:20:15] unto me. Billy usually comes and get me
[1:20:18] because you don't you don't talk to me.
[1:20:21] And this man just talked a blue streak
[1:20:27] and before I got over there all the
[1:20:30] anointing was gone from me.
[1:20:34] So his son Billy Paul used to come and
[1:20:36] escort him
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and Billy Paul never used to talk.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Another man came and spoke a blue a blue
[1:20:46] streak.
[1:20:47] Whatever that is, whatever anointing
[1:20:50] that came out that man's mouth broke the
[1:20:54] anointing upon that prophet.
[1:20:59] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Words have power.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Mark 7:20 says, he said, this is Jesus,
[1:21:07] that which come out of the man that
[1:21:09] defileth the man.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; For from within or out of the heart of
[1:21:15] men proceed evil thoughts,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; adulteries, fornications, m. He is
[1:21:22] showing that these things not outside.
[1:21:23] You know
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; it coming from
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; inside. So from the both evil thoughts,
[1:21:30] adulteries, fornication, murders,
[1:21:32] thefts, covetousness, wickedness,
[1:21:35] deceit, lasiciousness, evil eye,
[1:21:38] blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. All
[1:21:40] these evil things he called pride evil.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen now.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He still called pride evil. I didn't say
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; watch. All these evil things come from
[1:21:53] within and defiled the man.
[1:21:56] And I was amazed just after this the
[1:22:00] Bible said and from thence he arose went
[1:22:03] to the board of Tai and Sidon entered
[1:22:05] into a house and would have no man know
[1:22:08] it but he could not be hid.
[1:22:11] So Jesus trying to be invisible
[1:22:14] for a certain woman. He just talk all
[1:22:17] what inside somebody's heart
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; and listen to what happened here. Now,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; a certain woman, I like that, no name,
[1:22:24] just a certain woman,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; whose young daughter had an unclean
[1:22:28] spirit, heard of him, and came and fell
[1:22:31] at his feet. And the woman was a Greek,
[1:22:34] a sophician by nation. She besought him
[1:22:36] that he would cast forth the devil out
[1:22:38] of her daughter. But Jesus said unto
[1:22:40] her, "Let the children first be filled,
[1:22:42] for it is not me to take the children's
[1:22:43] bread and cast it into the dogs." And
[1:22:45] she answered and said unto him, "Yes,
[1:22:47] Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat
[1:22:50] the tan crumbs." He said unto her, "For
[1:22:54] this
[1:22:56] same,
[1:22:57] go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy
[1:23:01] daughter."
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord I shout this morning.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what is happening
[1:23:09] there? He just say out of the heart.
[1:23:13] Come on. Kind of evil stuff. this woman
[1:23:14] come and say my daughter FUR THE DEVIL
[1:23:16] HELP ME SAVE me deliver me he said I'm
[1:23:19] not taking the children's bread and
[1:23:20] giving it to the DOG SHE SAID THE DOG
[1:23:21] TAKE crumbs
[1:23:24] the words CAME OUT HER MOUTH
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T CUSS HIM SHE DIDN'T GO ON
[1:23:28] FACEBOOK AND RIDICULE HIM SHE DIDN'T LIE
[1:23:30] ON HIM SHE DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE A WHOLE
[1:23:31] BANAL ABOUT HIM SHE SAID FOR HIM THE
[1:23:34] DOVES EAT CRUMBS
[1:23:36] AND JESUS DIDN'T HAVE TO LAY HANDS HE
[1:23:38] DIDN'T HAVE TO PRAY HE SAID COME OUT
[1:23:40] DEVIL COME OUT DEVIL HAD TO SHUT AND
[1:23:42] TALK IN TONG HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:23:44] THAT. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE
[1:23:46] HOUSE. HE SAY FOR
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; THIS SAYING THAT MEAN YOU COULD SAY
[1:23:52] SOMETHING TODAY
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; that change the course of your life.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; The power of words,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; the power of speaking
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; because God spoke in the beginning
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; for what he wanted.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because there was nothing
[1:24:11] else to make it with.
[1:24:12] So God spoke of the word. He said, "Let
[1:24:15] there be."
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:20] [Applause]
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He said unto the her
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; for this saying go thy way, the devil is
[1:24:26] gone from thy daughter.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And when listen,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; hear the testimony. When she was come to
[1:24:33] her house,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; she found the devil going out.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And her daughter laid upon the bed. that
[1:24:40] devil take an exit
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; because a woman said something and she
[1:24:44] said something that
[1:24:47] that that influenced or affected the
[1:24:49] heavenly realms.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just words echoing on the
[1:24:55] earth. Something hit heaven. HEAVEN HIT
[1:24:58] THAT DEVIL OUT and the woman went
[1:25:01] hallelujah. JESUS CONFIRMING JESUS WAS
[1:25:04] CONFIRMING THIS THING ALREADY HAPPENING.
[1:25:06] Do you know what happening this morning?
[1:25:08] YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS
[1:25:10] MORNING. OH MY BROTHER ANWINE. OH, GIVE
[1:25:13] THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU ARE GOING FREE.
[1:25:16] YOU ARE BEING DELIVERED. YES. YES. GOD
[1:25:18] GOD COULD FILL YOU THIS MORNING. GOD
[1:25:20] COULD BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:25:22] GOD COULD COMPLETELY HEAL AND DELIVER
[1:25:24] YOU RIGHT NOW.
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:35] OH,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; give the Lord a shout.
[1:25:38] Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; You could speak words and uplift your
[1:25:45] children
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and you could speak word and damage your
[1:25:48] children.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Words can build
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; and words can break.
[1:26:01] Proverbs 18:12 says, "Before
[1:26:04] destruction,
[1:26:06] the heart of man is haughty."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; That's when you know somebody going to
[1:26:11] crash.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You don't have to prophesy over them.
[1:26:15] You know,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; once they hit that pride train or that
[1:26:20] pride motorbike, just get on the high
[1:26:21] end.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; They're speeding.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I never get that one. First time I get
[1:26:31] one B a motorbike of pride they going
[1:26:34] regular car you know taking a maxi you
[1:26:36] know they speeding on pride
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; they going and crash
[1:26:41] the same scripture continues and before
[1:26:43] honor
[1:26:45] is humility
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; so when you see somebody could humble
[1:26:51] themselves
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; aha you know
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; honor coming
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; blessing coming
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:27:00] The power in the seed is the gene or the
[1:27:04] DNA of the seed.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let every seed bring
[1:27:09] forth after its kind."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; A corn seed, coffee lead
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; to be avocado seed.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; The gene in the corn
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; is what will produce corn.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And the only way you know what's IN IT
[1:27:24] IS WHEN IT PLANTED and reveals itself.
[1:27:28] Or let's say it this way, the process
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; unfolds what's in it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; That's why things to reveal and unfold
[1:27:36] takes time.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Because you can only know fruit by when
[1:27:42] it go through the process.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Pumpkin seed and watermelon seed is very
[1:27:48] similar. If you don't know which is
[1:27:50] which, plant it.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Both of them run on vine.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; But you have to wait for fruit time.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Then you receive Mr. pumpkin and you're
[1:27:58] going to say Mr. Watermelon.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; So the seed gan is what God put. So God
[1:28:06] put a gene in you.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; A seed in you.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; And that seed have a destiny.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He said it this way. Who he for you, he
[1:28:14] called.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO HE CALL HE JUSTIFIED.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; WHO HE JUSTIFIED HE HAD ALREADY
[1:28:21] GLORIFIED.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT GOD PUT IN YOU HAVE A DESTINY.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Pan couldn't keep it back. Man couldn't
[1:28:27] give it back. Family couldn't give it
[1:28:29] back. JOB COULDN'T GIVE IT BACK.
[1:28:31] RELIGION COULDN'T GIVE IT BACK. YOU HAD
[1:28:33] TO COME FORTH BECAUSE GOD PUT THAT
[1:28:36] inside of you.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. THE LORD I SHOUT IN the house.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when a SEED
[1:28:43] HAVE AN OBJECTIVE, HE SAID, "MY WORD
[1:28:46] SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO me for it, BUT IT
[1:28:49] SHALL ACCOMPLISH." SO THE SEED HAVE AN
[1:28:51] ACCOMPLISHMENT. GOD HAVE A PURPOSE FOR
[1:28:54] YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN'T MISS FOR
[1:28:56] NOTHING. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE GRAY,
[1:28:58] YOU'RE BALLING, OR YOU'RE HERE NOW
[1:29:00] TURNING BLACK. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
[1:29:02] YOU'RE JUST BORN. THERE'S A PURPOSE
[1:29:04] BEHIND YOUR LIFE. THERE'S A PURPOSE
[1:29:06] BEHIND ALL WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH.
[1:29:08] THE DEVIL IS A LIAR THIS MORNING. DON'T
[1:29:10] LET THE DEVIL TELL YOU THAT SOMETHING IS
[1:29:12] IN VAIN. IT IS NOT IN VAIN.
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:26] for 2026.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; to choose your words carefully.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I remember ten commandments Moses tell
[1:29:40] Pharaoh,
[1:29:43] choose your words carefully. You know,
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; you know Moses, you know what Phar say
[1:29:48] after that? Every firstborn shall die.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; He's the boss.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He's the big man.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Not even realizing he's talking about
[1:29:58] his own son.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Because death and life
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; is in the power
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; of the tongue.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, could we get some praises tonight?
[1:30:16] Choose
[1:30:18] your words carefully.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; The 10 spies, those 10 ministers
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; in Moses message
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; of the hour
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; at that time
[1:30:32] when they came back hurriedly they asked
[1:30:36] the question, did the giant see you? No,
[1:30:41] they didn't see us. But we
[1:30:45] in our own eyes, these are their words
[1:30:47] now.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; This is what coming out of their mouth
[1:30:49] now. We in our own eyes was like
[1:30:52] grasshoppers.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; That is when you seeing Goliath as
[1:30:56] Goliath.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SEEING GOD AS BIGGER than
[1:30:59] your problems
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; or bigger than WHAT IS CONFRONTING YOU.
[1:31:02] I KNOW THINGS ARE CONFRONTING YOU. IT
[1:31:04] HAS TO BE.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; If things are not confronting you,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; something wrong.
[1:31:11] Everybody have things confronting them.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; God set it up that way.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You have your own golad.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; It's just that you PICK UP YOUR SLING
[1:31:24] yet because it take faith TO TAKE UP THE
[1:31:26] SLING.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; IT TAKE FEAR TO RUN TO GOLIATH. IT'S
[1:31:30] JUST YOU WATCHING. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED
[1:31:32] BY FEAR. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BY YOUR
[1:31:34] PAST. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BY YOUR
[1:31:36] FAILURES. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BECAUSE
[1:31:37] YOU NEVER GOT THE VICTORY BEFORE AND YOU
[1:31:40] THINK YOU WILL FAIL AGAIN. THAT'S A LIE.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; OKAY, THE LORD HAS SHOUTED OUT.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; AM I PREACHING TO SOMEBODY THIS MORNING?
[1:31:48] WHO AM I PREACHING TO THIS MORNING?
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; YOUR NEGATIVE PAST CAN'T help you
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; with the challenges of your future.
[1:32:03] Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; What could help you is what is positive
[1:32:06] in the past. Sometime ago, years ago, I
[1:32:08] preached about the anchor point.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; When the devil rock your boat and rock
[1:32:11] you off the moorings and what to get
[1:32:13] back to the anchor point
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; where you first met the Lord where you
[1:32:17] first get a breakthrough, put a stick
[1:32:19] THERE AND START BACK from there. GET
[1:32:21] BACK AN ANCHOR POINT AND YOU COULD HOLD
[1:32:23] ON TO THAT. DEVIL PUSHING YOU, PUSHING
[1:32:25] YOU, PUSHING YOU, BUT THE ANCHOR POINT
[1:32:27] GIVE YOU A SPOT. YOU COULD STOP.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD STAND. YOU SAY, "HERE I STAND.
[1:32:36] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Choose
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; your words,
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; carefully
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; and you could speak words intentionally.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Speak the right thing.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; David said it this way. The Lord is my
[1:33:03] shepherd.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell him that you know.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; God didn't say David say that. You know
[1:33:09] David express and make a declaration by
[1:33:12] Isaac.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; shall not want.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; So the devil CAN'T COME AND TELL THEM
[1:33:19] YOU GO WANT YOU GO BEG BREAD. DAVID SAID
[1:33:21] I HAVE BEEN OH YOUNG NO I'M OLD. I'VE
[1:33:24] NEVER SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR
[1:33:26] seed beg bread.
[1:33:29] DO I HEAR A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE?
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A MAN THAT IS WALKING BY FAITH,
[1:33:34] TALKING BY FAITH, LIVING BY FAITH. HIS
[1:33:36] WHOLE LIFE IS AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH.
[1:33:38] NOT FEELINGS. FAITH,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; NOT EMOTIONS. FAITH.
[1:33:46] GET OUT OF YOUR STINKING FLESH. GET OUT
[1:33:49] OF HUMANISTIC REALM. GET OUT OF
[1:33:50] EMOTIONS. AND LET'S TALK FAITH. LET'S
[1:33:53] HAVE A CONVERSATION THIS MORNING.
[1:33:58] [Applause]
[1:34:02] SEASON. Faith doesn't hide.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Faith speaks.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I believe, therefore, I speak.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Faith speaks.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; So, if you're not speaking, something is
[1:34:12] wrong.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; You're short on faith.
[1:34:18] James 1:19, "Wherefore, my beloved
[1:34:21] brethren,
[1:34:23] let every man be swift to hear,
[1:34:27] slow
[1:34:29] to speak,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; slow to wrath."
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Why did the Bible say slow to speak?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; You get an opportunity to choose your
[1:34:38] words.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; It was put your mind in gear before you
[1:34:40] start your mouth.
[1:34:46] Let me say it again. Put your mind in
[1:34:48] the gear
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; before you start your mouth
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; so you know what direction you're going
[1:34:55] then
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; pleasant words. Proverbs 16:24
[1:35:05] as an honeycomb.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Sweet to the soul
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and held to the bones. I asked my wife
[1:35:12] this morning, I said, "Why it is that
[1:35:13] gossipers only just gossip negative
[1:35:15] news?"
[1:35:18] You ever see a gossiper bringing good
[1:35:20] news?
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Boy, I are so blessed. I want to tell
[1:35:25] everybody the sister get a breakthrough.
[1:35:27] Gossiper not talking that
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; they close to the ground.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They heading for the information
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; to bring negative because of information
[1:35:38] nobody else have. So they feeling
[1:35:40] powerful and they have ears who willing
[1:35:42] to hear. You hear
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; you a hear this? You you hear this?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You hear this yet?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; You you you hear it yet?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. Let me tell you. I I I
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I have it. I I I I have it on have it
[1:36:00] on.
[1:36:03] But pleasant words are as a honeycomb.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Sweet to the soul and health to the
[1:36:11] bones. You want to be blessed, but man
[1:36:14] say something nice about people. Say
[1:36:17] something good. Say something loyal.
[1:36:21] You're creating an atmosphere saying
[1:36:23] that. Praise God. You start to talk
[1:36:25] negative. There's a negative spirit come
[1:36:27] around you and then drop on top of that
[1:36:29] and whatn not.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And people just pass things
[1:36:33] and when they pass people come and they
[1:36:34] talk the thing now then you get a
[1:36:36] backpack
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; monkey on your back not even your
[1:36:39] business but you're packing it
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; and when you're packing now said they
[1:36:44] get heavy you want to offload now
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; so you see how that going
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; somebody talk to you get a backpack
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; and you going but you want to carry this
[1:36:54] stuff but you know what she tell me and
[1:36:56] afterwards you you offload the backpack
[1:36:58] then a whole lot of people walk inside
[1:36:59] the backpacks I not carry nobody Put the
[1:37:01] backpack in. I have my own backpack to
[1:37:03] deal with. I don't want yours to carry.
[1:37:05] Mind your own business. Help somebody.
[1:37:08] Instead of talking them negative, see
[1:37:10] how you could pull them up. Life have
[1:37:12] enough struggles. People have enough
[1:37:14] battles. PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH FIGHT AND
[1:37:16] PROBLEMS FOR YOU TO BE A problem to
[1:37:18] them. DON'T BE A PROBLEM FOR ANYBODY
[1:37:20] INSIDE OF HERE. LIFT SOMEBODY UP. GET
[1:37:23] HELP SOMEBODY WITH THE BURDEN. ASK THEM
[1:37:26] WHAT THEY NEED. OPEN YOUR WALLET IF YOU
[1:37:29] HAVE TO. OPEN YOUR GROCERY BAG IF YOU
[1:37:31] HAVE TO SHARE.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; SPREAD THE LOVE.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; SPREAD THE JOY.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; PULL A HAND UP. I GOD PULL YOU UP.
[1:37:40] FORGIVE. DROP IT. LET IT GO. WALK PAST
[1:37:43] IT.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:37:49] [Applause]
[1:37:53] Speaking about Jesus, Luke 4:32 said,
[1:37:55] "And they were astonished at his
[1:37:57] doctrine."
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; For his word was with power.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So words could carry power with it.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Just as word could carry just text.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I call it verbal gymnastics. People just
[1:38:08] they don't want to say a table. They say
[1:38:10] four legs with a thing on top of it.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Saying that make it deep.
[1:38:15] It's a table.
[1:38:18] with four legs
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; making a riddle.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And the people say the mystery of four
[1:38:26] legs and thing on top.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; There's a table.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; I call it what it is.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Four legs. The mystery of the four legs.
[1:38:34] You see the four legs for horse riders.
[1:38:36] Type and all kind. It's a table.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 133. He that keepeth his mouth
[1:38:44] keepeth his life.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; But he that openeth wide, his lip shall
[1:38:48] have destruction.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I hear people say I have no lip in my
[1:38:51] mouth.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; A francointment.
[1:38:56] There's a word you hear of it. Talking
[1:38:59] um you
[1:39:02] um something um criticism. What you say
[1:39:05] again? Frank criticism.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Constructive criticism. Liars. You know
[1:39:11] nothing constructive or that you know
[1:39:13] they want to hit your heart. I only give
[1:39:15] you constructive criticism. How come you
[1:39:17] never give me constructive boost,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; constructive encouragement? How come you
[1:39:21] don't never lift me up constructively?
[1:39:22] You come to beat me on top of my head
[1:39:24] and talk about constructive criticism. I
[1:39:26] don't need that now. I need somebody to
[1:39:27] help me take the groceries to the car. I
[1:39:29] need somebody to lift up. You see the
[1:39:31] bag I HAVE CARRYING HERE? HOLD THE OTHER
[1:39:33] END. Let me carry it with me. Give the
[1:39:34] Lord some praises.
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:42] Why you order that? You didn't do heavy.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; But you see it heavy. You should have
[1:39:49] wait till your brother come.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; But but you and I here know.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; You're not offering to help. You're not
[1:39:56] offering to lift. You're only
[1:39:57] criticizing and say I should wait. I
[1:39:59] should buy a smaller one.
[1:40:02] one from a wait.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 18:21, "Death and life are in
[1:40:10] the power of the tongue, and they that
[1:40:12] love it shall eat the fruit thereof."
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; You could speak things that change
[1:40:18] people's lives.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; James, my brethren, be not many masters,
[1:40:27] knowing that we shall all receive a
[1:40:28] greater condemnation. For in many things
[1:40:30] we offend all. If any man here we go
[1:40:33] offend not in word,
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; the same is a perfect man.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; So a perfect man know to keep silent
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; when to speak.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; He not troubling people with words. It's
[1:40:47] a perfect man.
[1:40:49] Some time ago I was telling you I was
[1:40:50] washing washing. You brothers who
[1:40:53] doesn't wash
[1:40:57] God could talk to you while washing. All
[1:41:00] them brothers laughing
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; that don't mean your washing bees
[1:41:02] laughing you know
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; washing be still washing and washing
[1:41:05] bees mind you is not not not additional
[1:41:07] thing you know why he's doing that every
[1:41:09] day you know
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; so that's when they ignore you and
[1:41:11] they're congratulative washing wares you
[1:41:13] could understand why
[1:41:15] is is no bonus
[1:41:17] you're not getting a badge for that
[1:41:20] it's every day inside no badge for that
[1:41:22] no badge whatsoever don't even look for
[1:41:24] thanks thank you
[1:41:26] 20 years you washing you wash the woo
[1:41:28] you They say thanks
[1:41:31] and you expected about hallelujah glory
[1:41:33] kiss and a hug because you watch the war
[1:41:35] once and the blue moon come out once in
[1:41:38] a blue moon you no no no no don't no
[1:41:39] don't no don't no don't no don't no
[1:41:39] don't no don't no don't no don't no
[1:41:39] don't no don't don't don't
[1:41:45] while doing that he come to me not to
[1:41:48] ridicule and belittle anyone
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; it's quite strange and I tell my wife I
[1:41:54] say something come to me considering
[1:41:56] belittling and ridicule
[1:41:59] When I get along in the word now, that
[1:42:02] is where I bounce up the woman caught in
[1:42:04] the act of adultery and they caught in
[1:42:06] the very act and they thought they had
[1:42:07] her. They have the scriptures, they have
[1:42:09] the quote, they press play, they they
[1:42:11] read it, they listen to it and they
[1:42:13] ready for action. Now all them come with
[1:42:14] the big stone and Jesus they challenge
[1:42:18] him because the issue is are you
[1:42:20] following Moses? Are you following what
[1:42:21] on the tape?
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; That that was the issue there. We press
[1:42:25] play and we say big stone
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; like what we hearing. He said okay amen.
[1:42:29] Glory hallelujah. Jesus which one of you
[1:42:32] without sin
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; class the first stone.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And not only that he got to watch them
[1:42:36] you know because they were hypocrites.
[1:42:38] He got to watch them in the eye and
[1:42:39] watch them walk away. But he turned his
[1:42:40] back
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; give them what we call a exit ramp
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; to ramp out and to tumble the car and
[1:42:50] move out
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; and all of them one by one they move
[1:42:53] out.
[1:42:54] Then he knew when all them left. He
[1:42:56] turned to the woman. She didn't know
[1:42:57] they left.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm calling this case now. I'm
[1:43:00] trying it now. Where are your accusers?"
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; When she look around, she said, "None."
[1:43:04] He said, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Go and s no more." Something that was
[1:43:08] public going to private. And she had was
[1:43:10] to believe and accept forgiveness from
[1:43:12] God. And there was nobody there to
[1:43:14] witness Jesus tell her that.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; So she can't convince nobody. Well, the
[1:43:18] Lord forgive me. Oh, I know what you do.
[1:43:20] I know what you do. Forget them. Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Is not them forgiving you. Is the Lord
[1:43:25] forgiving you? Forget them. Let them
[1:43:28] talk. They will always talk.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't belittle them.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Humiliate them, embarrass them, shame
[1:43:40] them. They had their own shame to deal
[1:43:42] with. Their shame was in their hearts.
[1:43:43] That is why he tell them which one of
[1:43:45] you without sin castif when them look in
[1:43:47] the mirror, they know they're in
[1:43:48] trouble. They know if God come down
[1:43:50] because he she was seen inside of the
[1:43:52] heart and the heart was corrupt as ever
[1:43:54] even though they were pointing fingers
[1:43:55] at that woman. Oh God give the Lord some
[1:43:57] praises tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] Watch if any man who f not in word the
[1:44:02] same is a perfect man.
[1:44:05] All right.
[1:44:07] Watch.
[1:44:09] Behold we put bits in horses mouths and
[1:44:12] they that they they may obey us. We turn
[1:44:15] about their whole body. Behold, ships
[1:44:17] which are so great are driven by fierce
[1:44:19] winds, are turned with a very small
[1:44:21] helm, whethersoever the governor listed.
[1:44:23] Even the tongue is a little member
[1:44:27] boasted great things. Behold, how great
[1:44:29] a matter of little fire kindlet.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Up till yesterday, I see a clip with
[1:44:35] Madora saying, "You want me come for
[1:44:36] me?" Telling Trump that I said boy judge
[1:44:42] man challenging challenging Trump come
[1:44:43] for me. You want me to come for me? You
[1:44:46] come for him
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; and take him too.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Now his mouth say that you know
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; the tongue is a fire a world of
[1:44:58] iniquity. So is the tongue among all
[1:45:00] members that is defileth the whole body
[1:45:03] set it on fire the course of nature. It
[1:45:05] is set on fire of hell. For every kind
[1:45:06] of beasts and birds and serpents and
[1:45:08] things of the sea is tamed and has been
[1:45:10] tamed of mankind. But the tongue
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; can no man tame.
[1:45:15] I get about 10 amens there.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe the rest maybe rest tongue that
[1:45:20] say amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that you talking about ting
[1:45:24] saying amen. You know you say amen to
[1:45:25] the word. Don't let your tongue get
[1:45:27] tired up in. If this is coming to you
[1:45:29] say amen because this is the word. He
[1:45:31] said the tongue no man can tame. It is
[1:45:33] unruly. It's a it's an unruly evil full
[1:45:36] of deadly poison. There bless we God
[1:45:38] even the father and there cursory men
[1:45:41] which are made after the similitude of
[1:45:42] the mouth of God. Out of the mouth
[1:45:45] proceeded blessing and cursing. My
[1:45:47] brethren, these things ought not to be.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Bless your brothers. Bless your sisters.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Sometime our disappointments come
[1:45:54] because of our expectation.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; When you shift your expectation, you
[1:45:59] kill your disappointments.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Because you're expecting this brother to
[1:46:02] do this or your wife to do this or
[1:46:04] husband to do this or children to do
[1:46:05] this and they do it, you're vexed.
[1:46:06] You're upset. You're disappointed. Lower
[1:46:08] it
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; because your heart pressure will go up.
[1:46:11] Your blood pressure will go up. Your
[1:46:12] heart will rise up. You get plenty
[1:46:13] issues with that. You know, I learned
[1:46:15] that in Kywell.
[1:46:17] We used to come and pump gas lamp and
[1:46:20] tote water from the well and all kind of
[1:46:21] thing. A brother was nearby and when I
[1:46:24] travel all travel, he had no car. And
[1:46:26] when I expecting things to be done, I
[1:46:28] come I have to do it
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; and I couldn't understand but you right
[1:46:31] here.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I traveling
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; and afterwards I recognize maybe I don't
[1:46:37] know you're under pressure. I don't
[1:46:40] know. I change that. I do it right now.
[1:46:41] After what he my precious brother, God
[1:46:43] bless you. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; When I come, I just had to do what to
[1:46:46] do.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I not looking to him. Many times you
[1:46:49] looking to people and you have your two
[1:46:51] arms right here to do it.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; You look to others and you get great
[1:46:58] disappointment. Stop it.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Cut it out. Whatever your hands could
[1:47:03] do, do it.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Do it with all YOUR MIGHT.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; GET IT DONE.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; You're not doing it because you want
[1:47:08] somebody to do something for you. You do
[1:47:09] it because it needs to be done. It
[1:47:11] should be done. It got to BE DONE. LET'S
[1:47:13] DO IT. OH, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:47:16] house.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[1:47:22] Help me, Jesus. All right,
[1:47:26] he says,
[1:47:30] "All kinds, every kind of people, I have
[1:47:33] never seen one of them that come, but
[1:47:35] what was healed when they come upon the
[1:47:38] basis of faith?"
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For by faith are you healed,
[1:47:43] not how good you are.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; This is important.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; You're not healed because you're good.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And you try to be good, good, good. Then
[1:47:52] God will heal you. Watch this. I have
[1:47:55] seen people come that were renowned
[1:47:58] Christians and stand there and be told
[1:48:02] the reason that they couldn't be healed.
[1:48:05] I have seen street walkers, prostitutes,
[1:48:08] people of ill fame come off the street
[1:48:11] and be healed of of blindness
[1:48:14] and everything, sinners.
[1:48:17] No, you don't have to be a Christian to
[1:48:20] be healed. But you have to be a
[1:48:22] Christian to stay healed.
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that now? that God
[1:48:32] connects with faith,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; not feelings.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; God connects with faith,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; not how long you're in the message,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; not how long you're a believer, it's
[1:48:40] faith. That's why regardless of what
[1:48:42] condition you're in here this morning,
[1:48:44] right now,
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; faith would connect with God
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; and God could do something special for
[1:48:49] you.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Not because of your feelings or how
[1:48:51] long. No, because of faith.
[1:48:54] Amen.
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; So you could come early to all before
[1:49:00] service start with no faith and somebody
[1:49:03] could come last 5 minutes of the service
[1:49:05] with faith
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; and come and get their healing and walk
[1:49:07] back out
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; and you are happy you are early.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Very nice. Very lovely. We want you to
[1:49:14] come early. But where's the faith?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:49:21] Then Baron began to speak to a lady.
[1:49:23] He said, "My dear friend, when the enemy
[1:49:25] come like a flood, God raised the
[1:49:27] standard against it." Do you believe
[1:49:28] that lady sitting right here?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. You had more faith than you thought
[1:49:33] you had.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Then he's going down deeper. Now,
[1:49:36] brother Blackman, faith is a
[1:49:38] subconscious thing, lady. Faith is not a
[1:49:41] mental act. It is something that you
[1:49:44] subconsciously do it. People try to look
[1:49:46] to their intellects for faith when faith
[1:49:49] doesn't lay in there. Reason lays there.
[1:49:53] Faith lays in the soul.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; So that is why the prophet said,
[1:49:58] "Whatever the Lord lead your soul to
[1:50:01] believe, that is yours."
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Are we going somewhere this morning?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; We going somewhere. I want to So we
[1:50:10] going now because I want to see when it
[1:50:12] comes to what is in your heart.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; And when Caleb said, "I brought word."
[1:50:17] So when them guys stand up and said, "WE
[1:50:18] ARE MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE IT. He meant
[1:50:21] that.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He believed that.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; 2 10.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Well, you know the trinity will go. They
[1:50:30] go with the 10
[1:50:33] that have more people there.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So this so watch. All right.
[1:50:42] So many people have faith subconsciously
[1:50:44] and doesn't know it.
[1:50:47] You know there are many times we try to
[1:50:50] reach out for something for a certain
[1:50:51] kind of faith and you don't have to have
[1:50:53] that kind of super faith to be healed.
[1:50:55] The only thing you have to have is just
[1:50:58] take the faith that you got
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; what is in your hands.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You trust the Lord
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; for your family for your children for
[1:51:06] the Amen. And you you know like I said
[1:51:08] already sometimes the doctors come and
[1:51:10] the doctors give some pills and you take
[1:51:12] it like if it's dust say the lord
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; all them pills have side effect you know
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; but we take it you know but when come to
[1:51:20] the word and applying it you say Lord I
[1:51:22] believe you I'm trusting for my healing
[1:51:25] for my breakthrough praise God when the
[1:51:27] sabu stopped when he he had green you
[1:51:29] know he said I GO IN I GET green and get
[1:51:31] killed green
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; the whole family was in the car If he
[1:51:37] had swung to go across that he was going
[1:51:39] to get hit right out.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; He stopped.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Something there want to hold him right
[1:51:45] there. STOP.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; LET THAT CAR zoom pass and then go
[1:51:48] across.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; That's action of faith.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; That's not you. Human agree are going.
[1:51:54] No. You have to get sensitive now
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; to how the spirit leading and guiding.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus needs pass through
[1:52:03] Samaria. Hallelujah. because there's a
[1:52:05] woman he has to make. Some sometimes God
[1:52:07] pre-arranged things in such a way for
[1:52:10] you to get what you need to get.
[1:52:12] Sometime your blessing is not where you
[1:52:13] think it's coming from. Oh, give the
[1:52:15] Lord some praises.
[1:52:17] Hallelujah. You can't fix God blessing.
[1:52:19] It has to come through this one. Has to
[1:52:21] come to my family. It has to come
[1:52:22] through this. No, God doesn't work that
[1:52:24] way. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:52:28] Hallelujah.
[1:52:30] If you notice, subconscious is where you
[1:52:33] live. That is where you yourself live.
[1:52:35] And that's the reason people it's hard
[1:52:37] for them to have faith up here first. I
[1:52:39] got faith but now you say something is
[1:52:40] not for you. So what the baram says he
[1:52:42] people down in the platform there they
[1:52:44] have faith and when they come up here
[1:52:45] now no faith no faith no faith they
[1:52:47] coming up now because now he has to tell
[1:52:49] them where you come from your name your
[1:52:51] uncle you did something 10 years ago and
[1:52:53] then that raised the faith and no
[1:52:55] somebody down in the congregation no
[1:52:56] have no prayer card and they pulling the
[1:52:58] pillar of fire faith inside their soul.
[1:53:01] So when he's standing on the platform,
[1:53:02] faith pulling him because faith does
[1:53:04] move God. So he's on the platform and
[1:53:06] then he all stopped. He said that woman
[1:53:08] there you diabetes stand up there. Jesus
[1:53:11] Christ just healed you. Praise God. He
[1:53:12] come back here now talking to them your
[1:53:14] name is so and so and so and so and
[1:53:16] somebody pull said you you there across
[1:53:18] the the pillar of fires HANGING OVER
[1:53:20] YOU. THAT'S JESUS CHRIST in yesterday
[1:53:22] today and forever. Oh give the Lord some
[1:53:24] praises.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah.
[1:53:29] A time a time a woman the anointed by
[1:53:31] her and she take long to respond. He say
[1:53:33] you just miss your healing. You you take
[1:53:34] long to respond. You have to BE ABLE TO
[1:53:36] RESPOND. WHEN GOD SPEAK YOU HAVE TO
[1:53:38] RESPOND. When God speak YOU HAVE TO ACT,
[1:53:40] REACT. OH GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:53:43] I GIVE THE WHOLE MESSAGE WORLD IS DEAD.
[1:53:46] DON'T BRING THAT DEAD ANOINTING INSIDE
[1:53:47] OF HERE. THERE'S AN ANOINTING OF DEATH
[1:53:50] THAT'S IN THE MESSAGE. THE DEAD AND
[1:53:52] DON'T KNOW IT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:53:54] SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. preaching this
[1:53:56] MORNING WITH THAT DEAD CONGREGATION. BUT
[1:53:59] GOD IS NOT DEAD AND YOU ARE NOT DEAD AND
[1:54:01] WE ARE NOT DEAD. WE DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:54:02] DEAD. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT DEAD.
[1:54:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:09] [Applause]
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Your subconscious
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; is your soul.
[1:54:29] He said on Monday, Tuesday, I'm going to
[1:54:31] pray. Get ready for healing service.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; You can get on your phones wherever you
[1:54:34] wish to bring in anybody you want to for
[1:54:37] this coming revival. Tell them not to
[1:54:41] come in a hurry. Now, now
[1:54:45] I am going to run in and I'll be prayed
[1:54:47] for tonight and tomorrow night. You
[1:54:49] don't do don't do that.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Come in and listen for a while.
[1:54:53] He want the word to get to you.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Just as I'm teaching here this morning,
[1:54:58] I want this to get to you.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; We're not fanatical. We're not crazy
[1:55:02] like there's some crazy people in Sandy
[1:55:04] Grande and want to jump in prison.
[1:55:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; you want to come and listen for a while.
[1:55:12] We want to take our time and lay that
[1:55:14] word out so close that the devil won't
[1:55:16] even want a room to ever move.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Here we go. This is the part now. And
[1:55:22] when
[1:55:23] you let your faith run out to its end
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; till you begin to believe
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; you see it come to church and it's
[1:55:34] important that you come with some kind
[1:55:37] of expectation.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; The question is do you believe
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; for what you desire
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; or what you're expecting? Do you
[1:55:47] believe? If you're believing for your
[1:55:49] wife who is sick at home or your husband
[1:55:51] who is ill or your husband who have a
[1:55:53] challenge and you're believing when you
[1:55:55] leave here, you have to be under
[1:55:57] expectation that when you go back to
[1:55:59] your house, you see a difference in her.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; If you leave here and you go back and
[1:56:04] say, "Hey, the same you
[1:56:07] that wasn't believing. That was you
[1:56:08] expecting that."
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You're expecting that negative and you
[1:56:10] get the negative because that negative
[1:56:12] is in your subconscious. That negative
[1:56:14] is in your heart. You are saying what
[1:56:17] you want but at your at your conscious
[1:56:19] level but at your subconscious level
[1:56:21] you're believing different.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; So this is what he says here. Now
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; when you let your faith
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; runs out to its end till you begin to
[1:56:31] believe then let your subconscious go to
[1:56:34] acting then the faith of God will back
[1:56:37] it up.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Then you'll go right on out. See cuz
[1:56:41] your faith won't do too much. Your
[1:56:44] subconscious has to move in the
[1:56:46] direction that your faith is moving and
[1:56:49] then God faith move behind that. So he's
[1:56:51] talking about your faith and he's
[1:56:52] talking about God's faith. He's talking
[1:56:54] about when you let your faith run out.
[1:56:57] Hallelujah. Let your subconscious move
[1:56:58] in the direction your faith is moving.
[1:57:00] God's faith come behind that. When
[1:57:02] Goliath tell David, I will feed you to
[1:57:04] the birds, DAVID SAID, ALL GLORY TO GOD.
[1:57:08] THE WORD FROM DAVID M, I WILL CUT YOUR
[1:57:10] HEAD OFF.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; And he didn't have a sword. OKAY, THE
[1:57:13] LORD HAS SHOUTED US.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; It was words versus words.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen, Goliath was correct. He
[1:57:25] said, are that little boy you're going
[1:57:27] to send to me?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; And he was so big, he said, I'll feed
[1:57:30] him to the birds.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; He knew he could fling him up in the and
[1:57:33] feed him to the birds.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; But David was also correct.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF.
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:43] The Bible said David ran to meet him.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; I like David. You know
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; one stone will do it but take up five.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; David need didn't need to refill this
[1:57:53] the sling. One could do IT KNOW. I LIKE
[1:57:55] THAT.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Be precise.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Be scriptural. ONE COULD DO BUT GET YOUR
[1:58:01] BACKUP.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:58:06] You don't know if Gol have cousins and
[1:58:08] aunt and tanties coming.
[1:58:10] He had five stones. He noted one and he
[1:58:14] swung on it. He start off. You know how
[1:58:16] much birds David was he killed with that
[1:58:18] sling? You must thinking about he hit
[1:58:19] and target. He hit this big giant
[1:58:21] coming. How he can miss that? That is a
[1:58:23] big big target. That target oversized.
[1:58:26] He never see one so big. The biggest
[1:58:27] he's seen for a long time. How he going
[1:58:29] to miss that? He's just watching it.
[1:58:31] Watching it. And as Golad coming in, he
[1:58:33] loose that sling. And I said everywhere
[1:58:35] the head going the the t the bullet was
[1:58:37] going through. That was a guided
[1:58:39] missile. That was an anointed stone.
[1:58:42] That's what we have here this morning.
[1:58:44] WE HAVE AN ANOINTED stone this morning.
[1:58:46] WE HAVE A GUIDED missile this morning.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:55] That subconscious
[1:58:57] is where faith lies.
[1:59:00] I want to ask you something. Was there
[1:59:02] many times that you people in here, many
[1:59:03] of you have seen times when you just
[1:59:06] know something was going to happen? It
[1:59:08] looked like it was impossible for it to
[1:59:10] and you just know it was going to
[1:59:11] happen. Did you ever have that? That is
[1:59:14] faith.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; That is your subconscious at work.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; I've had that experience many times.
[1:59:19] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; When looking almost impossible, but then
[1:59:23] God come and work it out.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Then you see how God has worked.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. All
[1:59:29] right, let's go, brother.
[1:59:31] In the beginning was the word and now
[1:59:34] that's as far as we can go by theology.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; That's as far as you can go by our mind.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; But revelation takes us beyond that.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; What is a word? A word is a
[1:59:46] manifestation of a thought. It's an
[1:59:48] expression of a thought. Before you say
[1:59:51] anything, subconsciously you think it
[1:59:53] before you speak it.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So in the beginning
[1:59:57] was the word. That as far as we can go
[1:59:59] back, watch. But before the word was, it
[2:00:01] was a thought. And a thought was made
[2:00:04] manifest. And every word in the Bible is
[2:00:08] God's thoughts laid in seed form.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; If received in the human heart, human
[2:00:15] being, and spoke by the same thought
[2:00:18] that materialized the Bible, it brings
[2:00:20] the things to pass.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? How powerful could the
[2:00:25] church be
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; if the church catches this? that this
[2:00:29] Bible is God thoughts and God thoughts
[2:00:32] is the word
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; and if you begin to speak it then you
[2:00:36] are speaking God thoughts
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; then it's got to come to pass
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; not just the expression of what God said
[2:00:42] generally but to YOU
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY DAVID SAID it this way the
[2:00:46] Lord shall perfect
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; that which concernth me
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; okay give the Lord a shout I WANT YOU TO
[2:00:54] SEE it now he's not talking ABOUT
[2:00:56] EVERYBODY SAID THE LORD
[2:00:59] WILL PERFECT
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; THAT which concernth me.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; When Caleb SPOKE, HE SAID, "GIVE ME
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; my mountain."
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; A lot of you come to that spot yet.
[2:01:10] You're hearing the word from a general
[2:01:12] position. You hearing the word from
[2:01:14] ordinary. You're hearing, hearing,
[2:01:15] hearing. It's it's not personalized yet.
[2:01:18] When you begin to get it personalized,
[2:01:20] your world changes.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see, I see
[2:01:27] people out there regardless of what we
[2:01:28] do, we be criticized.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Do you are damned. Don't you are damned.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; So, I neither do nor don't.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; I do what God want me to do.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And I know I'm fine.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Who want to laugh, let them laugh, want
[2:01:39] to criticize, let them criticize. It
[2:01:40] doesn't matter with me. As long as I'm
[2:01:42] pleasing him,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; I'm fine.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not here to please
[2:01:47] everybody. I'm here to please God
[2:01:50] because it's a kingdom I'M REPRESENTING.
[2:01:52] HALLELUJAH. I'm not representing
[2:01:54] Trinidad. I'm representing the kingdom
[2:01:56] of the most high God. OKAY, THE LORD I
[2:01:58] SHOUT. I'M NOT REPRESENTING HSTONE
[2:02:01] TABERNACLE. WE REPRESENT THE KINGDOM OF
[2:02:03] GOD. THAT'S WHAT JESUS WAS PREACHING.
[2:02:05] THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:11] [Music]
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus say? If my kingdom wasn't
[2:02:15] of this world, my men would fight for
[2:02:16] me.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; My kingdom is not of this world.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; You know why he had to tell them that?
[2:02:21] Because they want to crown him. They
[2:02:23] want to make him assistant to Barabas.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I knew Barabus was a rebel fighter for
[2:02:28] the people.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; What GS for fighter for the people
[2:02:31] because GS 5,000 just bust them you know
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; 3,000 get fed next is 5,000 the numbers
[2:02:36] growing you know.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; He only come to hear no word you know it
[2:02:39] come from bread and fish.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; But now that you're here let me give you
[2:02:45] a word
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; bread and fish and word too. All right
[2:02:50] let's continue. So when God said let
[2:02:52] there be a world before it could be a
[2:02:54] word it had to be a thought. So God in
[2:02:58] the creation created the world by his
[2:03:01] thought first and the thought expressed
[2:03:06] became material.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:09] Before a word it's a thought and a
[2:03:12] thought has to be created. So God's word
[2:03:15] thoughts became creation when it is
[2:03:19] spoken by a word. Then here we go. He's
[2:03:22] switching it now. Then he present it to
[2:03:24] us or to you as a thought,
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; HIS THOUGHTS, IT'S REVEALED to you. Then
[2:03:32] it is still a thought until you speak
[2:03:34] it.
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; So God is the word.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; When he reveals it to you, it's only it
[2:03:42] will stay a thought until it come out
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; your mouth.
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:52] So the devil wants some of you to be
[2:03:54] dumb.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't speak it, it can't
[2:03:58] happen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's a big one, boy.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; If you don't speak it, it wouldn't come
[2:04:03] to pass.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your own life. Now,
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; you see, some people don't really want
[2:04:08] deliverance. They want to be in church.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; When you want deliverance, you'll speak
[2:04:13] it.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; I want deliverance.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; You would speak deliverance is mines. I
[2:04:18] claim it.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; I claim my breakthrough.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; I claim my inheritance.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; I claim all what God give sent to me.
[2:04:25] That's mine.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it this way. Jesus
[2:04:29] died. Okay, so the pentacle Jesus died
[2:04:32] and I'm saved. Jesus died. We know more
[2:04:34] than that. We know better than that.
[2:04:35] Jesus died to get the book
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; because the book had the names.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; So this seven is not a mysterious kind
[2:04:40] of thing and they can't understand. No,
[2:04:41] no, no. It's a book
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; with names.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Your name,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; my name on that book. He come now to
[2:04:47] bring the book because once you are
[2:04:49] taught our gene in the book you have to
[2:04:51] be expressed.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; We are taught that we bypass our word
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; and we come from thought to flesh. We
[2:04:58] bypass our theophony and come from
[2:05:01] thought to flesh to be TEMPTED TO BE
[2:05:03] TRIED. SO TEMPTATION IS NORMAL. TESTANCE
[2:05:07] IS NORMAL. Tribulation is normal. THAT'S
[2:05:09] WHAT WE DOWN HERE FOR. BUT WE ARE GOING
[2:05:11] BACK TO THE WORD. HE SENT A PROPHET TO
[2:05:14] BRING THE WORD. SO THE PROPHET BROUGHT
[2:05:16] DOWN ALL THE THEOPHANES in word form.
[2:05:18] HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CALLED ALL THE NAMES TO
[2:05:20] CALL YOU OUT OF WHATEVER CONDITION
[2:05:23] YOU'RE IN IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE NOW IS
[2:05:27] WHAT YOU WILL BE. THE DEVIL DON'T WANT
[2:05:29] YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL BE. YOU ARE
[2:05:33] DANGEROUS TO HIS KINGDOM. YOU ARE
[2:05:35] ROCKING HELL'S KINGDOM. OH, THE LORD HAS
[2:05:38] SHOUTED OUT.
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:45] HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE LAMB TOOK THE BOOK,
[2:05:51] WHAT DID JOHN SAY? HE SAID, "WE SHALL
[2:05:53] REIGN ON THE EARTH." THE REIGN IS A
[2:05:55] CONQUEROR, TO RULE, TO OVERCOME. THAT IS
[2:05:59] WHAT A HUMAN BEING SEEING WHAT THAT BOOK
[2:06:02] WAS ABOUT.
[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; When Jesus took the book, but Ram says
[2:06:10] he didn't take it for himself. He claim
[2:06:12] it for us
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; that we too can make claims.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10 8:11 he said go
[2:06:17] to the angel and don't beg him don't cry
[2:06:20] oh God. No he said tell the angel give
[2:06:24] me the BOOK THAT IS MY BOOK. I WANT THE
[2:06:26] BOOK. Give me the book. THEN YOU TAKE
[2:06:29] IT. THEN YOU EAT IT. THEN YOU PROPHESY.
[2:06:33] IT HAS TO COME OUT YOUR MOUTH. GIVE THE
[2:06:36] LORD A CHANCE. SPEAK FOR YOUR CHILDREN.
[2:06:39] SPEAK FOR YOUR FAMILY. SPEAK FOR YOUR
[2:06:42] HUSBAND. SPEAK FOR YOUR WIFE. SPEAK FOR
[2:06:45] YOUR HEALING.
[2:06:47] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. GLORY TO GOD.
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:55] GLORY.
[2:06:57] GLORY.
[2:06:59] AMEN. REMEMBER THE PUNCH may be
[2:07:01] seasoned.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus was passing one day.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; He's hungry.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You see a fig tree. He said, "Cursed be
[2:07:08] thee.
[2:07:09] No figure not
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; master pastor you you should have figure
[2:07:12] already
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; he's a curse
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and keep walking
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; next day
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; cypus see the fig dry up
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; from the roots up
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; master
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; the tree you curse dry from the roots
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; now that tree could be cancer
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; tumor
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; whatever system inside of you God could
[2:07:31] curse it dry from the roots female
[2:07:34] condition WHATEVER CONDITION GOD COULD
[2:07:37] CURSE
[2:07:38] FROM THE VERY ROOTS. GIVE THE LORD SOME
[2:07:40] PRAISES. HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; THEY TELL THE MASTER, "LOOK, THE TREE IS
[2:07:50] CURSED FROM THE ROOTS." And Jesus tell
[2:07:53] them,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; ordinary men just like you and I,
[2:07:57] fishermen,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; drunkards, all kind of homeongers that
[2:08:00] he calls them THE DISCIPLES. HE WATCHED
[2:08:02] THOSE GUYS WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST AND
[2:08:05] TELL THEM IF YOU SHALL SAY TO THIS
[2:08:08] MOUNTAIN IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART
[2:08:11] AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN BE
[2:08:14] MOVED AND DON'T DOUBT IN YOUR HEART YOU
[2:08:17] COULD HAVE WHAT YOU SAY OH GIVE THE LORD
[2:08:21] A SHOUT THIS IS GOD IN THE BEGINNING
[2:08:25] THAT SAY LET US MAKE MAN LET THAT MAN
[2:08:28] HAVE DOMINIONAL
[2:08:29] [Applause]
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:34] [Applause]
[2:08:38] [Music]
[2:08:45] LET me see this.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; You see that, brother?
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't take a man
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; until God is finished with that man.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Whenever you see God take a man,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; he's finished with him.
[2:08:59] Brother Bayham knew he was going.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see my end time."
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; And so he knew he was going.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; He knew it was finished.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He stood BOLDLY AND SAID, "THIS message
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; will fall in the hands of the
[2:09:10] predestinated."
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; When he walk away, HE WALK AWAY WITH
[2:09:14] FULL CON WITH FULL CONVICTION, WITH FULL
[2:09:17] CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL TOUCH down
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; and hit the finish line. THERE'S GOING
[2:09:22] TO BE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT GOING TO
[2:09:24] HIT the resurrection. They're going to
[2:09:26] hit the resurrection. They're going TO
[2:09:28] HIT THE FINISH LINE. THEY'RE GOING TO
[2:09:30] HIT THE RAPTURE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A
[2:09:32] BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
[2:09:35] [Applause]
[2:09:41] Paul Paul said it THIS WAY. WE SHALL not
[2:09:44] all sleep,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY. THOSE BROTHERS GOING AND
[2:09:49] SLEEP. THOSE BROTHERS GOING ALONG TO BE
[2:09:51] WITH THE LORD, BUT NOT ALL GOING.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; WE SHALL. OH, GLORY TO GOD. SOME GOING
[2:09:56] TO BE CHANGED IN a moment, in a twinkle
[2:09:59] of an eye.
[2:10:04] I know there's going to be a seventh on
[2:10:06] the revival. They could laugh. THEY
[2:10:09] COULD AIR TOUCH IT. They don't want the
[2:10:11] preachers in Trinidad. THAT IS THE
[2:10:13] BUSINESS. GOD SAID THAT JESUS CAME DOWN
[2:10:17] AS WHEN A LION ROAR IT. AND WHEN HE
[2:10:19] ROARED, SEVEN THUNDERS UTTERED THEIR
[2:10:23] VOICES. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE. NOBODY
[2:10:26] ELSE. THANK FOR THE BRIDE'S LAID. THAT'S
[2:10:29] FOR THE BRIDE. THAT'S NOT FOR THE BRIDE
[2:10:32] ASSISTANT. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE. THAT'S
[2:10:34] NOT WHO THE BRIDE CLOTHES. THANKS FOR
[2:10:37] THE BRIDE. THAT'S NOT WHO BUY THE BRIDE
[2:10:39] SHOES. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE.
[2:10:46] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. IF WE DON'T
[2:10:49] PREACH IT, are you going TO BELIEVE IT?
[2:10:52] HALLELUJAH. IF WE DON'T SPEAK IT, HOW
[2:10:55] YOU GET THE REVELATION of it, WE HAVE TO
[2:10:58] SPEAK IT.
[2:11:03] May
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; be seated.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH, HE COME OUT AND SAY THAT EVEN
[2:11:09] JEW OR RAIN WILL FALL TILL I CALL FOR
[2:11:12] IT. HE SHUT UP HEAVENS BY THE WORD FROM
[2:11:15] HIS MOUTH. OH, GLORY TO GOD. AND THE
[2:11:18] PROPHET SAID, "WAIT TILL THEM SEVEN
[2:11:21] thunders utter their voices to that
[2:11:24] group." THEY GOING TO OPEN UP THE
[2:11:26] HEAVENS. THE HEAVENS ARE SHUT.
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; THE HEAVENS THAT ARE SHUT. THEY can open
[2:11:40] up the heavens.
[2:11:44] [Applause]
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:48] [Applause]
[2:11:49] [Music]
[2:11:49] [Applause]
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:59] Let me let me see if you could spire
[2:12:01] with these words.
[2:12:03] Moses
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; was under the blood
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; of bulls and goats
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; that was just covering sin
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; and he spoke for flies,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; frogs,
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; fleas
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; under the blood
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; of bulls and goat. What would a man unto
[2:12:21] the blood of Jesus not only covering sin
[2:12:25] but eliminate, removes, decimate, wipe
[2:12:30] up clean like Clorax bleach. WHEN YOU
[2:12:33] PUT SOMETHING in Clorax be it dissolve,
[2:12:35] it disintegrate. IT IS NOT THERE. WHEN
[2:12:38] GOD LOOK DOWN, HE ONLY SEEN A SUN. OH,
[2:12:40] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. A SON BE GOING
[2:12:43] BACK TO EDEN. THE BOOK IS NO LONGER
[2:12:45] CLOSED. THE BOOK IS OPEN. THE BOOK IS ON
[2:12:47] THE EARTH. THE BOOK OF POWER, THE BOOK
[2:12:50] OF AUTHORITY, THE BOOK OF SIGNS AND
[2:12:52] WONDERS, THE BOOK OF CALLING OTHER
[2:12:53] NAMES, THE BOOK THAT CALLS OUT A SON,
[2:12:56] THE BOOK TO HEAL YOU, TO DELIVER YOU, TO
[2:12:58] REDEEM YOU, TO FREE YOU.
[2:13:00] [Applause]
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:06] [Applause]
[2:13:11] Brother said this way,
[2:13:14] God uses men.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; God could have used his son to preach
[2:13:17] the gospel. God God has used the wind to
[2:13:19] preach the gospel, but God chooses men
[2:13:21] to preach the gospel. What's the matter
[2:13:23] with the church today? There is
[2:13:25] something wrong. My opinion, we are not
[2:13:27] coming with that sincerity to the right
[2:13:29] thing. If God could do that by the blood
[2:13:33] of bulls, goats and bulls could only
[2:13:35] cover sin and made propriation for the
[2:13:37] sinner. But the sin was still there only
[2:13:39] covered over. What can he do
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; through the blood of his son
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; that omits sin? You don't realize that
[2:13:48] confessed truly confess sin omits sin.
[2:13:53] And if there's no omit, he builds a
[2:13:55] bridge across THIS CHASM TO TAKE MAN
[2:13:58] BACK IN the presence of the creator and
[2:14:00] make him a son of God.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:07] Oh my my my my.
[2:14:10] The creative word that was spoke by the
[2:14:13] lips of a mortal man.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; My God.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; A mortal man.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let me tell what's going
[2:14:25] on here now. After 12 pages going good.
[2:14:28] We going page nine. So, we just have
[2:14:29] three more pages to give more and we
[2:14:31] done.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus did the works of the father
[2:14:35] because the father was in him.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Because the father was in the son.
[2:14:39] Watch. And that God the Father, which is
[2:14:42] the father of Jesus Christ, the great
[2:14:43] spirit, dwelt in the fullness of his
[2:14:47] power in Jesus Christ, which was the
[2:14:49] tabernacle of God made flesh dwell on
[2:14:52] the earth.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; St. John the first chapter and brother
[2:14:55] Brandon's going on deeper. And the words
[2:14:58] was invisible.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; He said, listen close.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; The word was invisible
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; until it was made flesh.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Then the word
[2:15:09] becomes visible
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; in Lagos Nigeria. I told them that we
[2:15:14] are being identified with the message
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; but the hour is upon us
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; but the message will identify itself
[2:15:20] with us
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; with the bride and with the people.
[2:15:22] Right?
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; So watch this now clar
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; if the word is invisible
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; until it becomes flesh
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; then it means this word is still to
[2:15:32] become flesh
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; because when it becomes flesh it becomes
[2:15:36] visible.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; You can't stop it. because it becomes
[2:15:39] the living word.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; This is the spoken word, the Bible, the
[2:15:44] message is the revealed word. But when
[2:15:46] this thing become flesh, it is the
[2:15:49] living word.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; It's no longer in the scriptures. It
[2:15:54] comes out of the scripture and is in
[2:15:56] your flesh.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; You're walking with it. You're talking
[2:16:00] WITH IT. THE BIBLE SAID THEY SHALL LAY
[2:16:02] HANDS ON THE SICK and they shall
[2:16:04] recover. THAT'S NOT THE BIBLE ON THE
[2:16:07] PEOPLE. THAT'S HANDS. THAT'S THE WORD
[2:16:10] MADE FLESH. THAT'S THE WORD ALLOW THE
[2:16:12] ANOINTING ALL OVER THEIR BODY. THE
[2:16:16] ANOINTING UPON THEIR HANDS. ANOINTING
[2:16:18] UPON THEIR TONGUE, UPON THEIR MIND. YOU
[2:16:21] DON'T HAVE TO PRAY. JUST LAY HANDS. AND
[2:16:23] THE FIRE. HEY, THE POWER RELEASED. OH,
[2:16:28] GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:31] HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT PREACHER TALK.
[2:16:34] THIS IS FOR ALL OF US.
[2:16:37] [Applause]
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Brother says
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; through his sacrificial at Calvary,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; his resurrection
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; positionally placed his church
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; in that realm
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; that the same invisible God.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; There we go. Could come into the
[2:16:56] individual
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; and make the word visible.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; You see it in deep quality to the deep.
[2:17:02] But Ram preach then he come out say you
[2:17:04] know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on
[2:17:05] an angel of the Lord I don't know if
[2:17:07] he'll come all of a sudden but he is
[2:17:09] here
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; and when he says that he says these
[2:17:14] words afterward is the words you know
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; I take every spirit
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; under my control
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; that mean every demon hearing that
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; every spirit in the spirit realm
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; hearing him take authority.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Oh come on preach back to me. Preach
[2:17:30] back to me somebody.
[2:17:34] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
[2:17:36] [Applause]
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; So what through his sacrifices at the
[2:17:46] Calvary and his resurrection
[2:17:49] thy way does fight praise and worship.
[2:17:51] They fight the anointing. They fight
[2:17:53] crying out and whatn not. I could show
[2:17:55] you but I'm talking about when the Holy
[2:17:56] Ghost come make people shout,
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; make people clap, make people make
[2:18:00] noise. The holy kids never come and make
[2:18:02] it quiet in the Catholic church.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] And the priest shake shake the thing
[2:18:08] smelling up in the place and thing.
[2:18:10] Shake some smoke them up and things.
[2:18:11] Smoke them up.
[2:18:14] The condition is high up. So not not
[2:18:17] here. We ain't come to smoke you up.
[2:18:19] Smoke you up.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Quiet and you preach do all things fun.
[2:18:21] Everybody feel religious too.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; I know. You know I was inside of that.
[2:18:27] I was an acolyte.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; I could talk about this.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't talk about this tonight.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; So, watch. But man, now I've often
[2:18:39] wanted to come into a church. I've
[2:18:41] longed to see it
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; where I could walk in the back door,
[2:18:44] front door, wherever it was,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; look across the audience and see a
[2:18:48] perfect church all in order. Sin
[2:18:50] couldn't stay there.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; The spirit would call it out. You see it
[2:18:55] were like anaz and safara. You would
[2:18:56] just do it. He said no sin could stay
[2:18:58] inside of there. They will come quickly
[2:19:01] and confess it before the spirit got a
[2:19:03] hold of it.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Confess it and come and tell it cuz they
[2:19:06] know it's going to be called.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Almost done.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; You have got to get the living word in
[2:19:11] you
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; to have the living God in you.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Because the word here is God
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; when it is made flesh in you,
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; made spirit. life in you. Watch these
[2:19:25] words.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; When it goes into your flesh
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; and your faith
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; and becomes life.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; This word has to come into your
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; flesh
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; and your faith
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; and then it becomes life.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Then you are a living example.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; You are epistle of God read of all men.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Here's the problem here. Now the word is
[2:19:54] sharper than a two-edged sword.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; It can only be handled by one hand.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; A sword is dominant. It has nothing in
[2:20:02] it unless it's handled by a hand.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; So you COULD HAVE THE SHARPEST sword and
[2:20:06] put it on the pulpit here right now.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; This moving
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; this cutting. This get up and walking
[2:20:12] out and cutting and fighting for you.
[2:20:13] You know,
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; a hand have to pick up that sword.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's you now.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; That's your faith. Now
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; that's your action now. You can't sit
[2:20:21] and just hear. You have to apply.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; You have to pick up the SWORD
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; AND TELL YOURSELF that demon in your
[2:20:27] body have to go.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; THAT DEMON IN YOUR HOUSE HAVE TO GO.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; You can't pray. LORD,
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD LET IT MOVE SHARP. LORD, LET
[2:20:45] IT CUT GOING AND COMING.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You're watching this.
[2:20:49] Heaven will laugh at you.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Because God waiting for you to pick up
[2:20:53] the sword.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Let let me say it this way.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; When the hand of faith
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; can pick up God's word,
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; it will do the same thing Jesus did.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe you can cut a little, you have a
[2:21:07] weak hand of faith, cut out enough to
[2:21:08] say, I can see enough daylight to see
[2:21:10] I'm saved. But what about other
[2:21:12] promises? If you got a strong hand of
[2:21:15] faith, you pick up the full word of God
[2:21:17] and cut through every darkness until the
[2:21:20] light of God shines in and you look face
[2:21:23] to face with God if he abide in me and
[2:21:27] my words abide in you. You could ask
[2:21:29] what you will. You could speak what you
[2:21:32] will and it shall be done unto you.
[2:21:34] Isn't that right?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Almost done.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the word is a sword. A sword is
[2:21:40] perfectly dormant. If it isn't yielded
[2:21:43] in a hand of power, that hand of faith,
[2:21:45] it depends how strong it is. This hand
[2:21:47] of faith might be strong enough to cut a
[2:21:49] little hole through the darkness and
[2:21:51] say, "By faith, I'm saved." That's a
[2:21:52] great cut. But if there's all a stronger
[2:21:55] hand to heal a sword, that's all they
[2:21:56] can can cut. But if there's a strong
[2:21:58] hand, it will come through all plum
[2:22:00] everything the devil can put out there
[2:22:01] and make every promise shine forth.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; That word will cut in there. And if
[2:22:06] there's enough arm behind it to push it,
[2:22:09] that's why Ram says if God put you in a
[2:22:10] channel and you don't move, there's no
[2:22:12] faith in it.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; He can't pull in a pipe and pull out and
[2:22:15] and and say to him that overcome it, he
[2:22:16] pull you through. There is not
[2:22:18] Trinidadian go as you pass pass. Nobody
[2:22:21] watching pass fast pass fast pass fast
[2:22:23] pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[2:22:23] pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[2:22:23] pass we could talk that kind of
[2:22:25] foolishness but God not in that you know
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; you have to overcome
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; to overcome you to give you a test.
[2:22:34] If in your mind you have a certain thing
[2:22:36] of what you expect me to preach this
[2:22:37] morning, you read something last night,
[2:22:38] somebody spirit upon you, some demon on
[2:22:40] you and you read, let's say
[2:22:51] that
[2:22:53] my grandson Samuel read anything spoken
[2:22:56] back. I said, why you reading it? He
[2:22:57] said he he say marriage and divorce
[2:22:59] super you say put say put it back
[2:23:03] 10 years old put it put put it back put
[2:23:05] it back first. So you have certain
[2:23:07] expectation of something and you're not
[2:23:09] hearing that this morning and you upset
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; because some demon tell you last night
[2:23:14] not spirit of God you know some demon
[2:23:15] tell you last night what you hearing
[2:23:16] this morning is found in Isaiah chapter
[2:23:18] 1
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; the ox know it his owner and the ass is
[2:23:22] master script but Israel does not know
[2:23:24] my people doesn't consider God give you
[2:23:26] that and you come here this morning
[2:23:27] you're waiting for the ox you're waiting
[2:23:30] for that scripture now if I read that
[2:23:32] scripture you got confirmation ah go
[2:23:34] talking to me go a talking to
[2:23:36] You read the scripture just coincidence.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; when you forget your thoughts and ideas
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; and you receive the the word openly
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; and willingly be on target.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; My Lord, my Lord. There we go. Come up
[2:23:55] please. When listen if they had stayed
[2:23:58] with the word the Pentecostal church. He
[2:24:01] said when Pentecost offers started out
[2:24:03] in the latter day. When the word begin
[2:24:05] to be preached, if it had stayed like
[2:24:07] that, she probably had only only 50
[2:24:09] members today. But they will be
[2:24:11] bloodwashed. They'll have the power of
[2:24:13] God in them. The world will be shaken
[2:24:15] under her tremendous impact of the word
[2:24:18] flesh being spoken word by word by word.
[2:24:21] Oh my. Hallelujah. Praise God. But
[2:24:24] Stephen, praise him. Oh, glory.
[2:24:26] Hallelujah.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Let me go. I'm finished.
[2:24:30] Jesus know that there will be a great
[2:24:32] intellectual move in the last days.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I'm not going to leave
[2:24:37] you comfortless
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; and come again with you."
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; The purpose of sending the Holy Ghost
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; was for God to continue through a bunch
[2:24:47] of people
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; to continually manifest God to the
[2:24:50] world.
[2:24:52] Not by a creed,
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; not by denomination, but by the power of
[2:24:57] his resurrection, by making his word
[2:24:59] real by taking his promise. Here we go.
[2:25:02] And standing on the side of the minority
[2:25:05] and believing God and watch the black
[2:25:08] skies move back and the power of God
[2:25:10] moving and take over. That is what the
[2:25:13] Holy Ghost was given for. God bless you.

[2:25:18] lovely audience. Looking forward to see
