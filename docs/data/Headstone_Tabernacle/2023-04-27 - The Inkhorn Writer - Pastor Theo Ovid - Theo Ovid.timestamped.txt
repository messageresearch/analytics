[29:27] for as soon as I am travilled
[29:30] she brought forth her children
[29:33] Ezekiel chapter 9. beautiful verse 1.
[29:37] he quite also in my ears with the Lord's
[29:39] voice saying
[29:41] caused them that have charged over the
[29:44] city to draw near
[29:46] even every man with his destroying
[29:49] weapon in his hand
[29:50] and behold six men came from the way of
[29:53] the higher gate
[29:54] towards the North
[29:56] and every man a Slaughter weapon in his
[29:58] hand
[29:59] and one man among them was cruel with
[30:02] linen with a writer's in corn by his
[30:06] side
[30:07] and they went in and Stood Beside the
[30:10] prison holder
[30:11] and the glory of the god of Israel had
[30:14] gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was
[30:15] to the Cheshire of the house
[30:18] and he called to the man clothed with
[30:20] linen which had the writers in corn on
[30:23] his side
[30:24] and the Lord said unto him
[30:27] go to the midst of the city
[30:31] through the midst of Jerusalem
[30:33] and set a mark
[30:35] upon the foreheads
[30:37] of the men that sigh and that cry
[30:40] for all the Abominations that be done in
[30:43] the midst thereof
[30:45] and to the others he said in my hearing
[30:48] go ye after him to the city
[30:50] and smite
[30:52] let not your eyes spear neither have you
[30:55] pity
[30:56] slay utterly
[30:58] old and young

[31:27] holding the Four Winds of the Earth
[31:30] that the wind should not blow on the
[31:32] earth nor on the sea nor in any tree
[31:36] and I saw another Angel ascending from
[31:38] the East
[31:39] having the Seal of the Living God
[31:41] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[31:43] four angels to whom it was given to her
[31:45] the Earth and the Sea seeing who
[31:49] needless sea nor the trees till we have
[31:54] sealed the Servants of God in their
[31:56] foreheads and I heard the number of them
[31:59] which were sealed
[32:00] and they were sealed
[32:03] 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the
[32:08] children of Israel
[32:11] may God bless his word you may be seated

[32:44] First Corinthians 12 13 for by one
[32:46] Spirit we are all baptized
[32:50] into one body
[32:53] pray this prayer he said dear Lord Jesus
[32:56] we are summoned again in your name
[32:58] with great expectation
[33:01] for your point of the quickening power
[33:03] of God
[33:04] to bring us into recognition of our
[33:07] position and place
[33:09] and all responsibilities of being a call
[33:13] people separated from the world
[33:16] dedicated to God

[33:21] God will guide us and direct us in the
[33:23] things we do and see that it might bring
[33:26] honor and glory to your name
[33:30] so he was under expectation for the all
[33:32] point of the quickening power
[33:34] what are you on the expectation for
[33:36] tonight
[33:37] oh Hallelujah you have to be under
[33:39] expectation for that quick then power
[33:43] From the Inside Man brother Branham you
[33:45] know you would like to know what I think
[33:48] the greatest need of the church today
[33:49] would you like
[33:51] what I think where I think the lacking
[33:53] is
[33:54] is no soul trivial
[33:57] the people are not broke up enough
[34:01] listen to those words the people
[34:03] are not broken up enough
[34:07] there is no burden seemingly
[34:10] you give me someone that's so taught
[34:12] about lost souls that they cry
[34:17] and are wanting a Revival so bad till
[34:20] they can hardly eat
[34:22] they simply can't you can't continue if
[34:25] you read the history of the world and
[34:28] religious history
[34:30] you will find out it always take that
[34:32] kind of spirit to bring a Revival
[34:35] what kind of spirit Brokenness
[34:38] broken Spirit broken hearts you're
[34:42] feeling uh to pour out
[34:44] you want to repent you want to make
[34:47] things right you want to be reconciled
[34:49] to God you want to humble yourself to
[34:51] the Cross you want to lay at Christ's
[34:54] feet it takes that kind of spirit
[34:57] to bring a Revival not arrogance not
[35:00] Pride not you and your own self and your
[35:03] own thing people not caught up and and
[35:06] have a burden about Jesus Christ
[35:09] when you fall in love with the Lord you
[35:12] want to do the things that pleases God
[35:14] so not your children for you it's not
[35:16] the family first not what you feel first
[35:18] is what God first what Jesus won first
[35:20] so Jesus become the team of your life
[35:24] Jesus become the center point of your
[35:26] life everything is wrong with All Around
[35:28] Jesus not this is me no this is known
[35:31] it's about Jesus it's not about you oh
[35:34] Hallelujah
[35:35] so let's see saying that's right and
[35:38] then he quote the scripture he read when
[35:39] Zion travail
[35:41] and I think
[35:43] uh I I I when Zion travil I think is a
[35:47] better word why there's a big Echo here
[35:50] Isaac when Zion travil
[35:53] why she brought four children you have
[35:56] to be tore up the atmosphere or anything
[35:59] you have to be torn up so sometimes God
[36:01] allowed things to happen to break our
[36:03] Spirits yes to embarrass and shame us
[36:06] and mush us up
[36:08] so when we get broken we could cry
[36:11] because if God leave you intact you are
[36:13] fine
[36:14] Everything is Everything everything
[36:15] working out how your money how your
[36:17] house you have your car you have your
[36:18] land everything we're gonna find you you
[36:21] don't need God
[36:22] because things were colonize with you
[36:24] yeah but then God have to crush that
[36:26] amen break that something have to happen
[36:29] to break your spirit and if your spirit
[36:32] is not broken he will break it because
[36:34] there is going to be a reviver
[36:36] praise God do you believe that
[36:39] there is going to be Revival and you
[36:41] will have to get in that Spirit to get
[36:44] into the Revival oh priests and you know
[36:47] do you believe that
[36:49] Abraham said you get along with your
[36:50] arguments you get into the type of
[36:52] atmosphere if there's something in the
[36:55] church someone who is disobedient and
[36:58] acting ugly in the church and causing
[37:00] trouble you will never be able to have a
[37:03] Revival as long as that kind of
[37:06] atmospheres are wrong
[37:07] so all the rocks that offend God will
[37:10] move out
[37:11] all the people that want to be ugly go
[37:13] going to move them out run them out
[37:16] screw them out because God's going to
[37:18] have a right atmosphere
[37:20] for a Revival
[37:22] Oh Glory that God he will bust the rocks
[37:24] from Office Holy Mountain because God
[37:27] going to have a glorious Church Without
[37:29] spot without wrinkle and no human ever
[37:31] stop that church
[37:33] Hallelujah no Pastor human no Elder
[37:36] human no Deacon human no office on human
[37:39] no believer human no human spirit will
[37:42] just stop that church from coming forth
[37:44] because the Mount of the Lord had spoken
[37:46] it o praise the name of the Lord do you
[37:48] believe that
[37:50] so so watch is somebody acting ugly in
[37:53] the church and causing trouble you will
[37:55] never be able to have a Revival as long
[37:57] as that kind of atmospheres are wrong
[37:59] you have to have everybody if you notice
[38:01] when the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost
[38:04] they were all in one place in one Accord
[38:06] waiting for the promise and when we get
[38:09] like that the Revival will be there
[38:11] there oh praise God hallelujah and the
[38:14] reason I think we have just had
[38:16] protractive meetings instead of a
[38:18] Revival because we do not have a Revival
[38:20] of the nation as yet we have Revival
[38:22] like they did in the Wesley Revival
[38:24] Scotland all these Revival days or
[38:27] Wesley they had great breaking up and
[38:29] worldwide Revival by John Wesley that's
[38:32] when I take every Revival I notice in my
[38:35] Ministry this is whatever I'm talking
[38:36] now if the people will spiritual people
[38:38] and yet they will watch what God will do
[38:40] and signs and something that he will
[38:43] perform and the people sit and say well
[38:45] that's very fine and you'll notice God
[38:47] will do something else now and they will
[38:49] say that's very nice we appreciate that
[38:50] that was a good god well it's your duty
[38:53] God you did it as a duty no real burden
[38:56] they just take it for granted God
[38:58] blessing you you have health and
[38:59] strength you take God for granted did
[39:01] they go flat in the lie down on the
[39:02] hospital bed flat then you recognize oh
[39:04] God what's your ticket for granted
[39:06] that's why you ought to have an attitude
[39:08] of gratitude let me say it again you
[39:10] have to have you should have an attitude
[39:12] of gratitude
[39:13] you don't need to complaint because your
[39:16] face though the B system yet
[39:18] UFA is depressed yet you have gone in
[39:21] the wilderness yet the devil take you
[39:23] all day yet so right now you should have
[39:25] an attitude of gratitude
[39:27] that God will open your eyes to see this
[39:30] end-time message
[39:31] Oh Glory to God to see if you will stay
[39:33] with the word until your time comes
[39:36] Hallelujah you're going to wait till
[39:38] your time come we only waiting you know
[39:40] but one day the tea gonna turn the clock
[39:44] is ticking down you know time is running
[39:47] out all glory to God there's going to be
[39:49] a Revival
[39:50] Hallelujah just when the worst
[39:54] earthquake to strike America's truck the
[39:57] Revival Holy Ghost and Azusa that's true
[40:00] Hallelujah 1906 I believe it was
[40:03] I think it was 1906. hallelujah what a
[40:06] great earthquake and people was blaming
[40:08] God for that it was a great destructive
[40:11] earthquake with many fires but there was
[40:13] another earthquake
[40:15] in the spiritual realm that was littered
[40:18] up a different kind of fire it was Holy
[40:20] Ghost Fire it was a bonfire it was the
[40:24] answer to Revival and I believe tonight
[40:26] there's going to be another earthquake
[40:28] but this time will be the bright Revival
[40:30] it's going to be a holy ghost Revival he
[40:34] said what we see should make a church
[40:36] that would make a Revival that people
[40:39] will fly from everywhere saying the
[40:41] seven thumbnails of Revelation 10. the
[40:43] SE not even written it's being
[40:46] manifested Oh Glory to God so I am under
[40:50] great expectation tonight
[40:52] Oh Glory to God Amen do you believe that
[40:56] but Ibraham says no If there really was
[40:58] a Revival in the air when those things
[41:00] would take place every soul will grasp
[41:03] it quickly there will be no end to it it
[41:06] will just go from one to another from
[41:08] one to another it will keep moving of
[41:10] course you know I'm American like you
[41:12] are but in Africa down here where
[41:15] they're supposed to be hidden land it
[41:17] was kind of would make us feel ashamed
[41:19] of ourselves to see how they receive the
[41:21] Gospel when they see one Supernatural
[41:24] thing perform 30 000 receive Christ
[41:27] that's cool son saved at one time that
[41:29] was 50 000 there's no question it was
[41:33] just over that's all and I will tell you
[41:35] listen to this brother I think our
[41:37] people has relied too much on education
[41:39] and theology
[41:41] and so forth and has let it take the
[41:45] spirit's place
[41:48] so now it's the message loaded with
[41:50] knowledge and information and Revelation
[41:52] and understanding and topics and
[41:54] discussion and fellowship and people
[41:56] they have no feet
[41:58] no atmosphere learning with Theology and
[42:02] the theology it ended up a substitute
[42:05] for the spirit that's supposed to be
[42:07] here present
[42:08] for the spirit that's supposed to be
[42:10] working oh Hallelujah let me drop this
[42:13] to you I believe in Ezekiel the nine
[42:15] chapter that's what we read I'm pretty
[42:17] sure I may be wrong I know I'm quite
[42:19] sure it's Ezekiel 9 chapter when the
[42:21] Holy Spirit went forth first it was a
[42:23] man when fought from behind the gates
[42:27] with slaughtering weapons to destroy
[42:30] so they say these angels was coming to
[42:32] destroy
[42:33] is one among them was that one with the
[42:36] ink on with the right to right side
[42:38] isn't that right and that was of course
[42:40] scripturally applied was before the
[42:43] destruction of Jerusalem and there was a
[42:45] man came forward with a white robe and
[42:48] an incorn by his side
[42:50] and the commission was given to him by
[42:52] God to go through the city now listen to
[42:55] this and set a mark
[42:57] upon the forehead
[43:00] and he call it he say it here I'm
[43:02] reading I'm still reading the ceiling of
[43:04] the Holy Spirit
[43:06] they not understanding and getting a
[43:08] revelation and you know they would come
[43:10] to me we're not talking about that now
[43:11] he's talking about a mark yeah
[43:15] do you have that Mark
[43:18] you're talking about a mark
[43:19] this is not I see you should have this
[43:22] or Pastor say no no this is the
[43:24] scriptures now he says no go through
[43:26] listen set a mark upon the forehead the
[43:28] ceiling of the Holy Spirit a mark upon
[43:31] the forehead of every man or woman that
[43:33] sighed and cried for the Abomination did
[43:37] in the city
[43:39] so that's the quality of spirit
[43:41] that's a quality a attitude sighing and
[43:44] crying for the Abomination
[43:47] now I want to ask you
[43:49] if he was coming to Chicago tonight
[43:54] how many places
[43:56] would he find tonight that in the home
[44:00] they are laying subbing for Revival just
[44:04] in such a
[44:06] travil of soul that they can't stand it
[44:10] any longer
[44:12] they just don't know what to do I wonder
[44:15] how many would he mark
[44:17] in Chicago tonight
[44:19] of this city of almost 5 million people
[44:22] in it what would he mark
[44:24] I imagine you could count them on your
[44:26] fingers hardly don't you think so
[44:29] the people with that type of burden and
[44:32] yet that was exactly he wasn't a mark no
[44:37] one
[44:38] but that type
[44:40] are you that type do you want to become
[44:44] that type do you want God to come and
[44:47] put that burden on you
[44:49] that you want to be signed
[44:52] crying
[44:54] and groaning and travailing according to
[44:58] the scripture we read when Zion travel
[45:01] Zion brought forth
[45:03] if there is no travail nothing coming
[45:06] forward
[45:07] therefore God have to bring on a travel
[45:09] of soul
[45:10] traveling your spirit Beyond where you
[45:14] just have your needs met and and things
[45:16] being met and things working on for you
[45:17] something have to go beyond that
[45:19] that you can grasp the burden of God
[45:22] oh hallelujah praise God
[45:26] you see people individuals inside they
[45:28] have the individual interests and burden
[45:30] and conditions
[45:31] we who in Ministry not fortunate to be
[45:35] in your position amen
[45:37] because we have the burden of the entire
[45:38] church
[45:42] so when you study you and your family we
[45:44] can study our own family
[45:46] we have to study the entire church the
[45:50] burden is different the responsibility
[45:52] is different the weight is different
[45:59] Hallelujah so you can look for all the
[46:02] individual attention
[46:03] Edition was a thousand people how much
[46:06] time we will shake
[46:08] how much people we could go home by and
[46:10] fellowship with
[46:12] it can't work
[46:18] it can't work
[46:19] you have to good up your loins
[46:22] and become a Christian
[46:24] and make yourself a Christian
[46:27] you have to do that you ain't born a
[46:30] Christian you are born hungry and
[46:32] tasting after righteousness you have to
[46:34] be blessed Jesus said blessed are they
[46:36] that are hungering and thirst after
[46:38] righteousness I want God to bless you
[46:41] tonight
[46:42] that when you leave here you have a
[46:44] hungering in your soul that you can't
[46:46] even explain because God after creating
[46:49] that and barabanam said Lord created me
[46:52] a Revival let me hunger let me test God
[46:56] after creates what I created in you
[47:00] if it is knocking you you're only going
[47:01] to church you're a church member
[47:04] just a church member
[47:07] [Music]
[47:10] he wasn't a mark no one
[47:13] but that type yes a people
[47:16] you see what I mean he said we got to
[47:18] get mellowed up before God
[47:21] Hallelujah
[47:22] now Jesus
[47:24] a man went out and another man went out
[47:27] another hour and worked another man went
[47:29] out and worked and one man went out 11
[47:31] door
[47:32] and when he stopped at 11th hour he gave
[47:34] every one of them the same portion
[47:37] the living Tower they wondered why why
[47:39] did he did everyone working Luther
[47:41] worked on the looted this position the
[47:44] Methodist shouted Diana Wesley died in
[47:47] Grace We're living another age not back

[48:01] the powers of God

[48:07] power of God because that is what the
[48:09] Azusa Street introduced
[48:11] for years is Bible text
[48:13] Hallelujah the Catholic church should
[48:15] take away from the people and when and
[48:18] when they had no Bibles so the priest
[48:20] was interpreting the word to them God
[48:22] had the Germans they invent the printed
[48:24] press because the Bible was about to be
[48:26] restored so when the printing press the
[48:29] Bible went on print and then Wesley
[48:31] spread the print
[48:34] then God invent make science invent the
[48:37] audio tape because barabbana was coming
[48:39] that we could get the death of The Voice
[48:43] Hallelujah God know what you're doing
[48:45] when he won the word printed he got it
[48:48] printed when he won the word spread he
[48:50] got the spread when he wanted unclear
[48:52] because I don't take now he wanted to be
[48:54] seen
[48:56] or going about so that's why we have
[48:58] video
[48:59] that's why we are streaming because God
[49:02] wants he said the holy horse will go
[49:04] across the world overnight
[49:06] overnight this Holy Ghost will go across
[49:10] the world
[49:11] or Hallelujah it will sweep across the

[56:53] Oh Glory to God you believe that oh
[56:56] hallelujah hallelujah so before any
[56:58] tribulations can whatever come God have
[57:01] to seal you first do you believe that
[57:03] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[57:07] glory the lord
[57:10] so let me just break in here this is an
[57:12] interjection from Azusa and this is all
[57:15] testimony from it and I hear about the
[57:17] Terry talk about the choir singing
[57:18] heavily music and different things
[57:21] listen to this especially the enchanting
[57:23] strange of the so-called Heavenly Choir
[57:25] or him sung under the evident direction
[57:28] of the Holy Spirit both as to words and
[57:31] tune till my whole being is a testimony
[57:33] from my Jesus treat it was not something
[57:35] that could be repeated at will but
[57:37] supernaturally given for each special
[57:40] occasion and was one of the most
[57:42] indisputable evidences of the presence
[57:45] of the power of God
[57:46] perhaps nothing so greatly impressed
[57:48] people as this singing
[57:50] at once inspiring by a holy awe or
[57:55] feeling of indescribable Wonder
[57:56] especially if the hearers were in devote
[57:59] attitude
[58:00] this is what I get to
[58:02] Divine love
[58:04] was wonderfully manifest in the meetings
[58:08] they would not even allow an unkind word
[58:11] said against the opposers or the
[58:14] churches
[58:15] the message was the love of God
[58:17] it was a sort of first love of the early
[58:21] church returned
[58:24] it was a sort of First Love of the early
[58:27] church return the baptism as we receive
[58:30] it in the beginning did not allow us you
[58:33] talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:34] did not allow us to think speak or hear
[58:39] evil of any man
[58:41] that's what repeated that that word
[58:43] repeated the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:47] did not allow us to think speak or hear
[58:51] evil of any man the spirit was very
[58:55] sensitive and tender as a dove
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] are you like that hit the mystery
[59:03] as a real mystery
[59:05] oh Hallelujah not arrogant and proud and
[59:08] Lucy lip and say where you're born and
[59:10] this is me talking this is not that the
[59:13] spirit sensitive
[59:15] as a dove
[59:17] one man said I would rather live six
[59:22] months at that time than 50 years of
[59:25] ordinary life
[59:28] I have stopped more than once within two
[59:30] blocks of the place and prayed for
[59:33] strength before I dare go on
[59:36] the presence of the Lord was so real
[59:40] and he asked him for God for strength to
[59:43] reach the place
[59:44] because the power of God is upon him
[59:47] I mean we don't even know
[59:49] the presence of the Lord was so real
[59:50] scores of people were seen dropping into
[59:54] prostrate position in the streets before
[59:56] they ever reached the mission
[59:58] they would would get up speak in tongues
[1:00:01] without any influence from Jesus of
[1:00:03] people God had accomplished his work
[1:00:06] g.s Lang reports that some who came to
[1:00:08] investigate were baptized in the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost in their Legends
[1:00:13] scores of personal and eyewitness
[1:00:15] accounts are tests that many who came to
[1:00:17] ridicule the meetings were knocked to
[1:00:19] the floor where they seemed to wrestle
[1:00:22] with unseen opponents sometimes for
[1:00:24] hours
[1:00:25] these are the people who come to
[1:00:26] ridiculous because they will they will
[1:00:29] come you know
[1:00:30] oh yes when he sprayed fall it raised up
[1:00:33] other spirits and Satan will send every
[1:00:36] crackpot to see if he could disrupt our
[1:00:38] genuine Holy Ghost Revival
[1:00:41] so listen to this these people okay
[1:00:44] these people generally arose convicted
[1:00:47] of sin and seeking God one foreign born
[1:00:50] reporter has been assigned by his people
[1:00:53] to record the circus-like atmosphere in
[1:00:57] a comic relief fashion so he called me
[1:00:59] looking for kicks coming together report
[1:01:03] he attended a nighttime meeting sitting
[1:01:06] find it back
[1:01:08] in the midst of the meeting
[1:01:10] a young woman began to testify how God
[1:01:13] had baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1:01:15] when she suddenly broke into tongues
[1:01:18] after the meeting
[1:01:20] the reporters sought her out and asked
[1:01:22] her where she had learned the language
[1:01:24] of his native country
[1:01:26] she answered that she didn't have any
[1:01:29] idea what she had said and that she
[1:01:31] spoke only English he then related to
[1:01:34] her that she had given an entirely
[1:01:36] accurate account of his sinful life all
[1:01:40] in the language of his native tongue
[1:01:43] oh blessed be the name of the Lord so it
[1:01:46] wasn't a game in those days now it
[1:01:48] wasn't a play thing and balram said the
[1:01:50] Holy Ghost will be back in the church
[1:01:51] and there'll be a nonsense
[1:01:54] will be a perfect Church go go protect
[1:01:57] that church it will be a part of our
[1:01:58] church holy ghost in the church Oh Glory

[1:02:09] the Lord some praises

[1:06:32] let's continue
[1:06:33] oh my
[1:06:34] God
[1:06:39] now to see whether this message we got
[1:06:42] is connected with it or not the very
[1:06:44] hour that Israel was signing to be a
[1:06:46] nation is the very same hour the very
[1:06:49] same day the very same month I was at
[1:06:51] Greenville Indiana and the angel
[1:06:53] appeared to me and sent me out on the
[1:06:55] field with this he met me down the river
[1:06:57] and told me that would take place then
[1:07:00] commission me 11 years later at the same
[1:07:03] hour that Israel was signed a nation it
[1:07:05] is all connected together
[1:07:08] the end then he made a statement and let
[1:07:10] me keep preaching something like that
[1:07:12] the angel of the Lord is Unwritten now
[1:07:14] he's moving around fixing everything for
[1:07:17] the coming of the Lord
[1:07:19] now 1914 the world went to war there
[1:07:21] have been never had been peace since
[1:07:23] country swinging swinging swinging in
[1:07:25] and they're doing the very same thing
[1:07:26] yet and they was doing what holding he
[1:07:28] said oh God have mercy holding that
[1:07:30] great thing that I saw in division the
[1:07:34] whole team become a destruction holding
[1:07:36] the atomic holding the words that they
[1:07:38] don't destroy themselves until the thing
[1:07:40] come to destroy it until Israel returns
[1:07:42] back and get herself together and then
[1:07:45] the message will go to Israel and she'll
[1:07:46] be sealed with the Seal of the Holy
[1:07:48] Spirit after the Gentiles is called out
[1:07:52] the people his name's sake then Israel
[1:07:54] only receives a three and six three
[1:07:57] years and six month message
[1:08:00] Daniel said so there's given
[1:08:03] a space is given for the Gentiles when
[1:08:05] it comes to this age he called it the
[1:08:07] times of the Gentiles not even fixed
[1:08:10] yesterday called just the times of the
[1:08:12] Gentiles and when that time of the
[1:08:14] general is over the door is shut not one
[1:08:18] more Gentile to be saved and then God go
[1:08:20] over to the Jews oh my Hallelujah
[1:08:23] could I read on a little bit
[1:08:25] then there's three and a half years left
[1:08:27] for the Jews now if we get older version
[1:08:29] 11 we'll pick it up at the end of that
[1:08:31] Elijah and Moses returns again and
[1:08:33] preacher the Jews two men Anointed with
[1:08:36] that Spirit or maybe them themselves
[1:08:38] they never died so they killed them and
[1:08:40] they lay in the street called Sodom
[1:08:41] where our Lord was crucified Jerusalem
[1:08:43] and after three days the life Spirit
[1:08:46] came into them and they went up and
[1:08:48] raised up and then
[1:08:51] about a third of the Earth was blowed to
[1:08:55] pieces at that time

[1:09:15] up one another or kill one another or
[1:09:16] Destruction come until the Jews come
[1:09:18] down to that place and here sets the
[1:09:21] Bible he saw for angels and watch what

[1:09:37] nothing until those Jews return oh
[1:09:40] praise God hallelujah you love him
[1:09:42] tonight
[1:09:43] the last season we picked up and find
[1:09:45] out that the first church how it started
[1:09:48] off it was started their Pentecost where
[1:09:49] the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the
[1:09:51] Believers and we saw the reaction of
[1:09:54] these Believers and how they acted upon
[1:09:56] them nobody talks about that they
[1:09:59] explain away the Holy Ghost but they had
[1:10:00] an action
[1:10:04] and they did and signs and wonders
[1:10:07] follow them we find out at the closing
[1:10:09] Church age about 300 years they sprung
[1:10:12] up a heresy among them that Doctrine was
[1:10:15] the induction of the nicolaitan we find
[1:10:17] out it was Deeds to begin with in the
[1:10:19] next churches become a Doctrine then
[1:10:21] they become persecution at the Dark Age
[1:10:23] then the other side it come Protestant
[1:10:26] Church Martin Luther watch and he's
[1:10:28] seeing the spirit of God lead him out
[1:10:30] instead of letting the people stay free
[1:10:32] he organized a church and made an image
[1:10:36] liking unto the Beast
[1:10:37] be sure in his Spirit realm what God's
[1:10:39] seen people say that church God seen an
[1:10:42] image
[1:10:43] unto the Beast and let's let's go
[1:10:46] further a political power lighting unto
[1:10:48] it instead of letting the people walk as
[1:10:51] God gives light they organize under a
[1:10:54] discipline
[1:10:55] that they have to state that discipline
[1:10:58] what happened in the message what
[1:11:00] happening churches people are doing
[1:11:01] Doctrine and teaching and people
[1:11:03] following Doctrine and teaching
[1:11:05] Hallelujah and that and and that is
[1:11:07] supposed to put them in the bride like

[1:11:10] private bride yeah nobody can take a
[1:11:13] church outside and like that is the
[1:11:14] brother Jesus Christ and then minister
[1:11:16] to the brother Jesus Christ that that
[1:11:18] doesn't exist the bride of Christ is a
[1:11:20] body by one Spirit you are baptized into
[1:11:23] that one body nobody can hijack that
[1:11:26] bride and have that by the corner you
[1:11:28] can hijack trust members anytime you can
[1:11:30] have thousands of church members but
[1:11:31] that bride that's Jesus Christ first
[1:11:34] Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself
[1:11:36] descending from Heaven would have shout

[1:12:06] at a Revival that struck the world the
[1:12:07] Holy Spirit was with them teaching
[1:12:09] sanctification and the first thing you
[1:12:11] know they organize the church and made
[1:12:13] an image unto the Beast a political
[1:12:15] organized power to bind the people
[1:12:19] that's what that anointing does it binds
[1:12:22] the people to assist them and not the
[1:12:24] holy ghost that is what we are fighting
[1:12:27] Hallelujah systems binding is a power
[1:12:31] you know it's a mechanism
[1:12:41] foreigners there is no Miracles there is
[1:12:44] no power the church is dead
[1:12:47] under our power
[1:12:50] different kind of power
[1:12:52] you see we don't see that's power you
[1:12:54] don't see that power but it's a power
[1:12:55] I'm reading to you
[1:12:59] he said the first thing you know watch
[1:13:01] God move forward the first thing you
[1:13:02] know when they did that they organize
[1:13:04] the church may not imagine to the beast
[1:13:05] that's right a political organized power
[1:13:07] to bind the people of God to a Creed
[1:13:11] instead of being free to worship and
[1:13:13] walk in light as light was thrown in
[1:13:16] their path did you realize Christian
[1:13:17] friends that the Antichrist which is the
[1:13:20] mark of the beast aha now we come to
[1:13:22] another Mark put a mark the income right
[1:13:25] to have a mark and the bees have a Mark
[1:13:27] it's just two marks it's not 24 marks
[1:13:30] it's not tattooing all over it's just
[1:13:31] two marks Mark of God and Mark of the
[1:13:35] Beast I was saying that it's just true
[1:13:38] I like that it's simple it's just two
[1:13:40] marks it's not 24 marks it's a buffet
[1:13:42] style Max take whatever Mark you want

[1:14:09] the Beast whose names are not written in
[1:14:12] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:14:14] foundation of the world
[1:14:16] Oh Glory to God we are crazy we're not
[1:14:19] crazy Oh Glory to God we are not crazy
[1:14:22] this is the message this is the word
[1:14:26] back to the Bible
[1:14:28] what the Pentecost back to the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost back to Dynamics and we are
[1:14:34] emphasizing Dynamics we emphasize in the
[1:14:36] spirit
[1:14:39] oh my God do you realize Christian
[1:14:42] friends that the Antichrist which is the
[1:14:44] mark of the beast the Antichrist
[1:14:45] everyone knows that the Antichrist there
[1:14:47] that his Mark is his power
[1:14:52] a beast is a power
[1:14:54] there is a power in the Catholic Church
[1:14:59] I want you to understand what the
[1:15:01] prophet saying here there is a power in
[1:15:03] the Methodist Church so it's not like
[1:15:05] they have no power no it's what kind of
[1:15:08] power
[1:15:09] because the causes of millions is a
[1:15:12] power keeping them people inside the
[1:15:13] idea whether to our father entry healing
[1:15:15] Mary
[1:15:17] yes it's keeping them there you know
[1:15:20] they're not moving every Sunday morning
[1:15:25] have them under control
[1:15:31] Church
[1:15:36] that is the beast power the Baptist
[1:15:39] Church is the same
[1:15:40] yes the Pentecostal Church Jehovah
[1:15:43] Witness all of them it's peace power you
[1:15:46] can change a Jehovah Witness
[1:15:48] unless the name on the book will stay in

[1:21:07] that
[1:21:20] Hallelujah
[1:21:22] so what I'm talking about is heading up
[1:21:24] to two great teams coming to the end
[1:21:26] time the mark of God and the Seal of the
[1:21:28] Beast is none right on the seed of God
[1:21:30] any minister no is a baptism of the Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost remember what the mark of the
[1:21:34] beast is the mark of the beast is kind
[1:21:36] of eso reject that Birthright didn't eat
[1:21:39] so we bitterly trying to restore that
[1:21:41] bit right again but there was no place
[1:21:43] of repentance when you reject the Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost you seal yourself outside of God's
[1:21:47] mercy now you say brother Branham you if
[1:21:51] you can tell us our diseases and so
[1:21:53] forth you are Prophet well I am still
[1:21:56] the same person that's right I still got
[1:21:58] the scripture said it's exactly right
[1:21:59] it's the truth it's hearing people say
[1:22:02] there'll be a Mark it's already marked
[1:22:04] just reject the Holy Ghost and you are
[1:22:07] marked
[1:22:08] receive the Holy Ghost and you are
[1:22:10] marked that's right receive it once and
[1:22:12] see what take place receive it once
[1:22:14] that's the mark of God and you are
[1:22:17] sealed to your Eternal destination like
[1:22:20] the cow out on the road the inspector
[1:22:22] comes and by no if you didn't get the
[1:22:24] Holy Ghost last night that went in there
[1:22:25] check up the night the inspector of the
[1:22:27] Holy Ghost is here inspecting you over I
[1:22:30] used to work at the Pennsylvania
[1:22:31] Railroad we load a car with cans the
[1:22:34] inspector comes along Shake everything
[1:22:36] to see if they want any looseness
[1:22:39] and that's the way God does his church
[1:22:41] he shake it to see what's the matter
[1:22:44] with it to see if there's any looseness
[1:22:46] in you before he pours his Spirit into
[1:22:49] you and if the church is a little shaky
[1:22:52] he won't pour His Spirit into it if you
[1:22:54] still love the world and want to do the
[1:22:56] things of the world you will never get
[1:22:57] the Holy Ghost upon that you might get a
[1:22:59] confusion you might get stammary lips
[1:23:01] you might get speaking in tongues but
[1:23:03] you still that don't mean you have got
[1:23:04] the Holy Ghost where you got the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost you are sealed by God to your
[1:23:09] Eternal destination
[1:23:11] and when the inspector come and check
[1:23:13] that don't go good that car he shut the
[1:23:16] door and put a seal on it and when God
[1:23:18] sees you are really so Lord for him he
[1:23:20] fills you with the Holy Ghost you are
[1:23:22] sealed by the Holy Ghost until your
[1:23:24] destination oh praise the name of the
[1:23:27] Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:23:31] praise God so we are waiting for the
[1:23:33] finishing of the seventh seal to prove
[1:23:35] who we are Oh Glory to God the bride get
[1:23:38] caught up at the finishing of the
[1:23:40] seventh seal and the foolish version
[1:23:42] will be exposed for the three and a half
[1:23:44] year tribulation period Oh Glory to God
[1:23:46] resisting the Holy Ghost and they will
[1:23:48] not even know it until the television
[1:23:49] hit them
[1:23:56] glory to God that's the reason I spoke
[1:23:59] against the church there's only one
[1:24:01] Church unless the body of Christ but
[1:24:03] these lodges that is called churches
[1:24:05] blasphemy must name why blasphemy it is
[1:24:08] to be contrary or speak against what God
[1:24:10] Said and God said come and be born and
[1:24:12] they say come and join and when the
[1:24:14] baptism of the spirit is forcing took
[1:24:16] over for water away from the Catholic
[1:24:18] church he said and the Protestant Church
[1:24:20] an emotion in a Pentecostal church
[1:24:21] instead of the person of Christ coming
[1:24:25] in with all that building material
[1:24:28] instead of the person of Christ coming
[1:24:30] with all that pyramid building we had
[1:24:32] the other day after your faith virtue
[1:24:33] and spiritual knowledge Peter said these
[1:24:35] things
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:37] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:24:39] virtual knowledge and depth that's the
[1:24:41] Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some praises
[1:24:45] that is what the Pentecostals was short
[1:24:47] of
[1:24:48] oh my let's continue quickly the great
[1:24:51] Angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ

[1:24:54] full sexed us he brought him from a
[1:24:56] natural land to a natural land from
[1:24:57] Egypt to Keenan land the second exercise
[1:24:59] he brought him out of a spiritual
[1:25:00] condition into the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost and this third one now he's big
[1:25:04] enough for my spiritual baptism of the
[1:25:06] Holy Ghost
[1:25:08] it has to come from the Holy Ghost
[1:25:10] baptism to the land of the Millennium he
[1:25:13] said come out a chaos come to the Living

[1:34:58] word with the gospel with the truth that
[1:35:00] came out of the Pentecost and there was
[1:35:02] a dark age that blocked them out then
[1:35:04] the middle of the day Luther Wesley came
[1:35:06] in and then there is to be here we go an
[1:35:09] evening time message to receive the same
[1:35:11] thing that is at the beginning and then
[1:35:13] he said the even time message is to
[1:35:15] restore back again to bring back that
[1:35:17] same thing
[1:35:19] he said we say you communism 19 2019 the
[1:35:22] bride United themselves God uniting why
[1:35:25] never before since the early church was
[1:35:27] the pillar of fire among the people
[1:35:29] never before since the early church did
[1:35:31] they see the things we are seeing today
[1:35:32] and this lesson was only made possible
[1:35:35] when God sent Seven Seals and give us a
[1:35:39] Sign by it he sent seven angels down
[1:35:41] from heaven
[1:35:42] come to bring back that scattered word
[1:35:46] in damn denominations and tied back into
[1:35:49] the word of God again to bring down his
[1:35:52] holy spirit so all this word unfolding
[1:35:55] word revealing and words showing and
[1:35:57] we're tying together the object of the
[1:36:00] tiny word together to see this big
[1:36:02] picture is to bring down very long shout
[1:36:06] it out Bring Down the Holy Ghost so the
[1:36:10] object is to bring it on oh give it a
[1:36:13] God
[1:36:14] as many as received him
[1:36:18] to them there's the power
[1:36:21] to become the sons of God
[1:36:23] it will take the Holy Ghost to form You
[1:36:26] Into the Wilderness
[1:36:28] Oh Glory to God no teaching doing that
[1:36:30] oh my God
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:36] so you have a serpent in your heart and
[1:36:38] it's upon your baptized that the person
[1:36:39] discipline still there
[1:36:41] you shake his hand welcome to the church
[1:36:43] he's supposedly because you're born with
[1:36:45] that serpent another
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:04] come and drop inside your heart
[1:37:06] change your nature If any man be in
[1:37:09] Christ he's a new creator
[1:37:11] all things are passed away
[1:37:13] Oh Glory to God change your nature
[1:37:16] change the desires Oh Glory to God
[1:37:19] change you all together something
[1:37:20] happened with him
[1:37:22] that makes you a Christian
[1:37:26] you say that
[1:37:28] is a reform intellectual yes they
[1:37:31] reformed
[1:37:32] Hallelujah you're on your way to be
[1:37:34] converted but I'm says until he receive
[1:37:35] the Holy Ghost you're on your way
[1:37:42] because your daughter you receive it
[1:37:44] it's a promise
[1:37:46] and we have to preach it because the
[1:37:48] promise it's a promise of God if you
[1:37:51] don't preach it you can get it you have
[1:37:53] to know it's a promise but run say you
[1:37:55] have to know it's given for you
[1:37:58] no glory to God you have to know what it
[1:38:00] is
[1:38:00] and you have to know it has given for
[1:38:02] you and we are here to say it's given
[1:38:04] for you
[1:38:07] my mind
[1:38:09] so seven angels come to God in this
[1:38:11] scattered word to bring the vision of
[1:38:13] what we're supposed to receive Jesus did
[1:38:15] the same thing when he rose from the
[1:38:17] dead he appears to disciples under the
[1:38:19] Lord open their understanding and open
[1:38:21] their word that they might know what
[1:38:22] they could receive just try to tell them
[1:38:24] nothing again he said tarry in the city
[1:38:26] of Jerusalem until you endude with more
[1:38:29] Revelations no that's what you give them
[1:38:32] until you endure with your
[1:38:34] interpretation no until even during my
[1:38:37] Mysteries
[1:38:38] somewhere
[1:38:44] from where from where from on high
[1:38:49] it's an old man of the unhigh brother
[1:38:51] it's God on high
[1:38:54] oh give the Lord a shout is there no man
[1:38:57] coming on from on high it's only God to
[1:39:00] come on
[1:39:01] so Jesus let them know where the power
[1:39:03] coming from
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:30] I ain't no crazy preacher this is the
[1:39:33] same old time holy spirit that the devil
[1:39:35] won't go near it that the people that
[1:39:37] people are sharing but it's good enough
[1:39:39] for me we need this old-fashioned
