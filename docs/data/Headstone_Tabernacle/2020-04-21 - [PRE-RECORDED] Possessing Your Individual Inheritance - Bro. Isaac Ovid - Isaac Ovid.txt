the rapture he spoke about the rapture next chapter he said we are the children of light in children of the day cccd said is coming to us in a mighty mighty way we will be just standing here and a lot of God will drop down this is a day this is just glorious day and I think on on a birth of my son Daniel he came out a different way halfway inside the head out and and started to crack and the doctor

a many many [Music] [Applause] how many appreciate the special but Anthony I'm no longer a slave and a man so if you have your Bibles I'd like to go straight to the woods tonight reading just one portion of Scripture reading from Ephesians 1 and reading from verse 3 Ephesians 1 and verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having me known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inherence inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will may the lord and a blessing to the reading of his word henry bower heads for wood of Prayer heavenly father any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Ghost to breathe life upon his father Lord may you speak to your people tonight me use me as your instrument Lord me you annoying the words that would be said me you bless the word and the reading of the word Lord open our understanding Lord me tonight be a knife you will never forget father me your Holy Spirit take complete charge tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen any man you may be seated so I have a title tonight it's possessing your individual inheritance and I have a subject another holy time is here and I have an inspiration the higher law of the eighth day the higher law of the eighth day and in a message personal experience with God but the Branum said what we need today is a good old fashioned scene pause revival and the baptism of the Holy Ghost like fell on the day of Pentecost to bring a people back to a living faith in God again that's exactly I believe in confessions to raise up and accept Jesus Christ that's good I believe in all that but friends we need something more than that so I believe this meeting and my design my heart is to have more than just a service more than just a meeting but an experience with the supernatural with the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they had on a day of Pentecost and but the Branham said the day of Pentecost was the eighth day said a day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on the eighth day so I'm happy to be identified with an eighth a holy convocation and you know that Aaron's rod was dead for years but when it was left overnight in the presence of God it brought forth buds blossom and brought forth fruit because it was in the right place it was there at the right time and something had to happen and whenever you were in the right place at the right time something has got to happen now Aaron's rod could have only brought forth what was the genetic code of that rod that raka that I've brought for coconuts it could not have brought for apples it had to be whatever that rod was so even though the rod was dead and it looked like it have no life the genetic structure of the have not been compromised genetic structure of the rod has not been broken the genetic structure of the rod have not been tampered with him maybe you come to this meeting looking to get something more than yesterday but maybe you are tired maybe you are wearing maybe you are frustrated I have good news for you the genetic code that has been written inside your genes has not been damaged it has not been compromised it might it might look dry but son of man can't these dry bones lives on a man and this rod come back to life can the church team and so I've got good news for you God does not want to replace you he's not in the replacement business God is in the restoration business he wants to restore you I will restore see at the Lord restoration has nothing to do with you he said I will restore it's not even your efforts he is the one doing the restoration I will restore unto you I will restore your joy I will restore your peace I will restore your victory I will restore your family I will restore your loved ones I will restore what the devil took from you I will restore your wealth I will restore your health I will restore your telling it a witness in the house this morning tonight God wants to restore to the position you would have had if a man had never fallen but a Peter said this morning it was not your fault that man fell we were not even there it was Adams fault and because of Adam we fell as a result of it but God wants to restore you and I to the position we would have had if Adam had never fallen semen oh my you may be seated can I get a little more monitors please god bless you you may be seated for a minute I got some good news for you many of us we see we don't want to get old we are afraid of getting old well I've got some news who you are all that than you up here hallelujah I said it to the church a couple of weeks ago you are older than you appear because before the earth was you were before the Sun was you were before it was a moon you were you are older than the Sun you are all that any earth you were all of that or you don't hear me tonight you are older than the devil because you are gene attributes of God before the devil had a beginning he will have an M name but we are creatures of eternity we are older than what we appear whatever what new devil what young devil that is a son and she beaut son of the Spirit that existed in the back part of oh you don't hear me tonight Oh glory hallelujah you may be seated ah so don't take my ears for granted don't take how I look for granted I'm an old soul I come from Carla I go back to God we were there when we kicked the devil out of heaven we were there we will kick him out on this earth also because we shall reign on the earth this land belongs to me this earth belongs to me the trees know who you are the Lions know who you are that's why the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God we are creatures of eternity we are not teachers of time we are creatures from another dimension we are from another world and listen we live by a higher law we buy the law of the a stage when we enter the eighth day the law of one to seven matters no more you may be seated we're gonna get it oh but I peg off I thank God that his numerology has never ever gone wrong but their Branham you may be seated when he was speaking about the eighth day he said keep your numbers running he said one two three four five six seven he said you think you got me huh he said but he ain't did goes back to the first day he said the church ages that's in the seven one two three four five six seven but he said the eighth is different he said that eternity eternal he never had a beginning he doesn't have an ending the end he always was he everything is your king you belong to the 8th King you belong to a different place you belong to a different world you live by a different law [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah there's a different law you may be seated young people you might walk in the same places not the people in the world walk but there's a different law when you walk the devil knows you are different he can't figure it out but he knows you are not from here he knows there's something about you he can't pin it down but you are creature of eternity listen you may be seated that's one of the biggest problems the devil has with you you know because he has an end coming but you have no ending so you can look at the devil in the face no matter what he says to you and say devil one of these days time no longer and when time or wrong and when time runs out it means the devil and his works run out and when time runs out only the eternal will be left standing only the creatures who are connected to the entity will remain standing oh I'm so glad for twentieth century profit factor bring revelation about the eighth day about the holy convocation people who can receive it Amen so true for knowledge God could be destined eight you it's because he knew you before so your destiny is guaranteed because he already knew what school you would go to he knew what job you would have he knew what village you'd be born in you know what school you go to what church you will go to and he knew that you would find his message and this message would find you to connect you back to your identity because when you came left eternity as a thought to be expressed in time you forgot where you came from so something had to kind of wake you up to not you a little bit to let you know that when you were drinking smoking doing whatever you were doing that there was something else that was troubling your heart.you realizes where the Brabham said there's something more to light and waking up in the morning I'm going to work there's something more to light and pay the bills there's something more to life and trying to impress the neighbor next to you that there's something more to life that having black beans and having a tractus and having high blood pressure there's something that mortal dag here's a different law where there is no high blood pressure there's a different law where there is no a brighter Sun there's a different place where there's no tiredness there's another world where there is no depression there's not a place where there is no death there's another place where there's no crying it's an eternity it's an eternal place and the church even Oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody say Amen somebody say hallelujah so we are going to a place you may be seated we have a destination we are not just existent to exist there are many people or just existing they're just killing time but time is not the currency of our economy Oh hallelujah that's why each day that passes we are changing currencies toccata please wear when you speak it's created go it up that you can see Mountain shift a little bit this way because heaven is not our destination the Bible says we shall reign on the earth this earth belongs to me the devil is squattin he has no legal right but for all these years God has been waiting to our people the serve the eviction notice [Applause] you maybe see this for a minute you may be seen it for a minute I want you to catch something God is the judge the sentence has already been passed the devil has to evict but when a judge gives the order for eviction there has to be somebody to enforce the order and we know the Holy Ghost is the enforcer but even though the Holy Ghost is the enforcer God's tell us the police the Holy Ghost inside of individuals to move the Holy Ghost around so when he had to go to Cornelius and he had oh you know you know with me this morning when he had to go to these people they had to be somebody he could use and he could eat me he can make a deposit of the Holy Ghost in them and not a transfer can take place so young people God is looking for somebody he can make a deposit of the Holy Ghost in so we can move it around from country to country from neighborhood to neighborhood to your family can the church say man oh you may be seated Oh hallelujah you may be seated so I'm not talking about Church this is not about church to its age is over we are talking about the bride we are talking about a new creation we are talking about not being church members but Peter said this morning the bride could go where the church members cannot go the bridal experience what the just remember could never experience it I love that brother pizza oh the church member you're gonna wind them up come to church sing shout but the bride because she knows who she is she needs no encouragement when she sees her love of the word when she sees two crewmen view she gets excited every single time because she is in love she is in love she is in love she loves the world she loves to worship she loves to be the atmosphere when he is around she gets excited that's the difference between the church member and the pride of Jesus Christ oh you may be seated hallelujah my so you are called for a different age you are called for a different experience you are called to taste something that only if you could understand and young people I love to speak to young people natural solutions I always say this cannot solve spiritual problems your problem is not much more education and much more training your problem is you need a Holy Ghost natural solutions and that solves your problems your depression is not because of finances your depression is you need more the Holy Ghost because if you have the Holy Ghost he can lead you to the right job he can open the right door what we need is the Holy Ghost what we need is a spiritual solution and the church see man what the world needs is Jesus yes we might have mind battles you may be seated yes then my things might be bad but God will have a people God will have some young people who will see no no toward the devil has to offer no to the devil's temptations no to everything that he has come the Jets amen you may be seated for a minute can somebody see no cancel my scene only loud wonderful you may be seated why did you do that but I say because we need some more young people who could say no no that that was offer whatever he brings to you you respond to know I don't care how good it looks it's no why because I'm on a destination to a different place I don't want your offer I don't want what you're given to me I don't want it because I don't belong here I'm not gonna be satisfied with what the world has to offer because I'm a creature of eternity only eternal things that satisfy me amen you may be seated for a minute so I was looking at that scripture I'm not eating a holy convocation it says a powerful two words there'll be no servile work therein and I just was meditating on that no servile work therein and I went to do some research in that word survive and what that servile wood means and that word servile is connected to slavery so it mean that when that if they comes it means your day of doing stuff that you are forced to do is over and many young people say I want to give up this and I want to stop doing better my heart wants to do the right thing but more than that servile work is defined as when there's a job to do and there's a physical component and a mental component but the physical component far exceeds the mental so it's when you're working almost like a drone you're working because you're forced to work you're working because you are pressured to do it without having to think about it that's how the children of Israel were in Egypt it was servile work it was not their creativity it was not their ideas they will foster bring out the ideas that the Egyptians wanted but if he comes it's a different day altogether there's no more survival there's no more doing what the devil wants you to do there's no more taskmaster there's no more you have to smoke you have to drink you have to lust you have to have jealousy no no no no no lover no more self I work there in that is your need to be free when that is the account is a jubilee time you can put down your tools that you have been working with and you can claim back your inheritance because it's the evening there's no more working 30 so I declare tonight that in this holy time it's another jubilee for the bride of Jesus Christ and the devil's that I've been holding you they have got to let you go name of the Lord you may be seated what do you say memorizer the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever this time I put the devil he has had his keys to operator but the devil cannot go into that 18 he cannot go into eternity he has no access to that world because it is your world it is your kingdom and the church same hallelujah my my my you may be seated [Applause] hallelujah second chronicles 7:14 says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land if my people and the first time the Bible uses my people is in Exodus 3 7 when the Bible says and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I've heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters joy I know their sorrows I want you to understand friends that God I've already promised their deliverance but even though there was a promise over them he still had to wait till he heard the cries of the people and when he heard the cries he remembered the promise it was under the taskmasters under the slave masters of kept them doing things that they didn't want to do because they were forced to do it the taskmaster was keeping them doing the sin and the bondage and the building or whatever it is so whenever you don't feel like worshiping it's because it's a taskmaster telling you you shouldn't worship when you don't feel like praying it's because it's a master that's over you can you don't pray because the taskmasters they control your time past masters control when you wake up in the morning the master tells you when to eat the master tells you what time to go to bed and the children of Israel got tired of the taskmaster telling them to get up in the morning I'm going through this I get up in the day I go into that and the taskmaster puts too much until the turn of Asia being a crime they begin aside and I see begin a crime God began together and coffee get together and the noise came up to God and God listened had to do something about it he couldn't hear it and not do anything about it he could be hear it and leave them alone because God had to respond to the call and the church seaman colony Ceylon and two hundred thousand thousand demons two hundred thousand thousand taskmasters have been assigned to stop you from hearing this message the children of Israel were born into slavery in Egypt just as we were born into sin because of Adam and the tax masters have been with us in our schools under jobs but he has always been a covenant that is a freedom coming it's been a covenant not a deliverer was coming there's a covenant that there's an opportunity coming to get out of here fear of thought you would have had them forever but God made a promise hero did not know that it was a time limit on his operations he didn't know that he was operating under the constraint of time but God's promise does not limited by time so God knew his people had to come out of Egypt they were there for a season but the destination was not Egypt it was an inheritance that they had to go to and whatever God had to do he was going to do to get them out the church semen you may be seated and I could imagine that here oh I've heard a rumor that a deliverer was coming they say there's somebody coming as a rumor coming and table it's only a rumor but I keep my time like no other time when God had to do something and Moses came on the scene but I want to declare tonight that tonight we said time Satan time up Pharaoh we have seen our names we know who we are we know our promise we know what our inheritance is we know this is our day to break out of the chains to break out of the shackles to put down our heads to put down our tools and head to the promised land see some thought he could stop the life he's taught he could stop you but that life and you can never be stopped and the church say man somebody give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] you may be seated friends we're not promised a system Jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with the system we wasn't promised a system what will be promised a kingdom how do you get into it by one spirit we are all baptized into this kingdom it's the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal King given for his eternal world with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life he is the king we are baptized into it settled in heavenly glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord under the brand of continues we are dead our lives are hidden God through Christ not only that but we are raised with him raise up what in a system a denomination organization no we are resurrected in the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within you why all these man-made systems must fall not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shut or moved that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom and it's subjects are dead the systems of this world that's what the columella was talking about dead to the systems of this world its subjects are dead to these organizations instead to these political systems and now we are in this kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved all these other things are falling apart the prophet said America is falling apart Europe is falling apart Asia is falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom and eternal Kingdom it cannot be moved [Music] [Applause] mine so in the message of future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride there's seven great feast days but that was only a type of the seven church ages all right let's take the last piece which is the Feast of the Tabernacles now notice here in the 36 verse seven days shall you offer offerings made of fire unto the Lord but on the eighth day on the atheist shall be a holy convocation there's another holy time coming holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein now we got an EP now there's only seven days but here we speak of the eighth the holy convocation do no work in it it is what back to the first eight it speaks of eternity no the is he Jesus raised for our justification he eternal King with eternal Kingdom to be baptized into to eternal life not seven days have nothing to do with any of the days it's speaking of another eternal coming speaking of an eternal world now notice after fifty days or seven servers from there again there comes another holy convocation what happened and this is my desire the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the is D now this is your promise this is my promise this is what I'm looking for for another day of Pentecost because the Pentecost is the nd is your holy convocation where the brother said it has nothing to do in a literal things it has nothing to do with your bills it has nothing to do with your problems it has nothing to do with how you feel it has nothing to do with if you're tired it has nothing to do with what's happening at home it has nothing to do with your problems it has nothing to do with the litter of things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life my mind you may be seated with the predestination with the pre Testament that never did stopped you brother Branham said the pre-tensioning that never did stopped it never started on anything you wasn't saved on anything you was always saved Jesus come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with somebody shout hallelujah you had eternal life to begin with you maybe see them not only and some people they can't understand this excitement that you had eternal life to begin with because you know you have your troubles and you have your child's and your your testings what eternity you talking about if you know what my reality is you ain't tell me about eternity but I'm telling you there is a greater reality than your present reality you were always in God you were always in corner if your memory could go back to before there was a moon we thought it was a God had to react joke the question where was now when I lay the foundations of the earth the chalk is memory job where were you I want you to kind of remember that you come from a different place up don't let your trials get you down don't let your temptations get you town don't let your problems get you down where was dow when I lay the foundations of the earth and the morning stuff [Applause] you may be seated and by the banner said we have lived through all these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go on into eternity you don't come my laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination there's a genuine holy convocation and we are ending the seven church age church it's a Pentecostal is you see it we're entering that holy convocation we are entering into the real genuine eternity where the church is called not the sum station some denomination but into eternity your calling is into eternity with the eternal King mine so DFD what does it mean it means freedom the day means restoration the NT means redemption there means Pentecost he means a super Church if there means another Ephesians the FE means a baptism of the Holy Ghost DSD means your family has got to come dat means you get the Holy Ghost the idiom means you are touching dat means you are perfected the it means you are no longer preacher of time but you are creative eternity you could be walking the earth but you are eternity walking on the Eternity walking into the eternity walking on your charm eternity the storms to come eternity will be feeling of people and wanting an eternity put on flesh and this motor with the immortality and will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye oh hey man he is there means that all that atom loss is coming back to the manifested sums up God it couldn't happen in the first stage it couldn't happen in the second day they couldn't happen in the Paul's day but in this day now after the seventh day in a bright age into the eighth a brother there's no devil there's no demon gets those spirit yes motion gets knocked out there's no unbelief there's nothing could stop the prize from taking her position there's nothing to stop the prize for possessing her individual inheritance hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah my my my my mind you see before Adam fell Adam was living in eternity there was no death there was no sickness are you with me I don't didn't know what that was he didn't know what sickness was he didn't know what it was to be depressed all Adam knew to do was if he didn't like where the mountain once he could move the mountain a little bit if you wanted to talk with a lion he could call the lion over Adam had perfect dominion perfect control but when Adam fell it brought time and it broke out of utility so it deep brings us back into eternity but I want to get that there's a different law when you're in time then when you are into eternity can the chance amen because in time you have gravity so where the Branum said a direct quote you say when you lift your hands you are defying a loss you will define the laws of gravity so it means whatever laws exist in time can be defined by a higher law against the law that covers the seven days and it's a different law for the east day so when you in the seven day law you in that time but in that seven day law somebody could be dead but when you bring the ad in the contact with the 17 law that dead life could get straight from the F P so when Jesus stood outside of the tomb of Lazarus they were in time but he's a creature of eternity he could sleep Donna the power that was spoken was not 70 power that was 80 power that was another place that was powered not even from time and he said Lazarus come forth Lazarus had already left what that voice was able to cut two dimensions find where Lazarus was traveling him because it was a higher law [Applause] and the church seaman you may be seated and whenever the Indian law meets a 70 law it brings a 17 laws under subjection so Jesus is sleeping on the boat the boat is subject to 70 law and the winds come and the storm come Jesus is sleeping he is tired the disciples are frustrated what are we gonna do their way Jesus up Jesus looked at the strong he looks at the sky he looks at them and he s Suites the eternal words water from a language that has spoken ent and he said peace be still and when that strong heard those words and recognized that was that man speaking that was seventy law that was the law of the east hey man you may be seated young people that's why you are going to make it and you're gonna get the Holy Ghost because the seed in your soul it's not a natural seed it's not a seed of these seven days it's an eternal seed that seed never had a beginning never has an ending for your predestination is stronger than your trials your predestination is stronger than your mistakes your predestination is stronger than your failures your predestination is stronger than the devil without power your predestination is stronger than the devil you recently as day you may be seated you may be seated hallelujah so when you feel down and you get a charge from your theophany your theophany is not trapped by the seven days your chi often is coming from eternity these bringing strength on the ESP the Eve's DS where the presence of God is because God dwells in eternity that's where all the power is the power is in eternity and that's what the table is afraid of because once eternity drops down here he is finished father let the fire for a holy convocation we are in a new team I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what's gonna take place but I believe young people are gonna be baptizing in the kingdom because it's the 8th day another day of Pentecost and the church same [Applause] we may be seated hallelujah so your joy is not from the natural your joy could never be satisfied because your appetite has already been introduced to if their joy your appetite has already been introduced to the victory of the eighth day your appetite has already been introduced to success from the eighth day for nothing the world has to offer you good value anymore that's why when you're not in church you feel miserable you know your feel miserable when you're not in the presence of God because your appetite has already been introduced to something that is so good you can try different substitutes but it can never taste as good as the food from the eighth day it never tastes as good from the land of eternity because that's your destination it's eternal life you are not supposed to tire you are supposed to have eternal life you are not supposed to be sick you are supposed to walk over sickness and in this overtime addition because it exists in the empty in the if there's only creatures that have no beginning could be there and sickness had a beginning the devil had a beginning your trial had a beginning your problem you know when your problem started it had a beginning it must come to an end amen hallelujah somebody give God a shout of praise you may be seated I love that you know when your problem starts you know when the pain started in your body once you can identify the start point it means it's an ending because whether Panem said your salvation there was no beginning to it you was always saved he was always eternal if you can identify the starting point it's coming to an end I can identify my starting point because I always was always was part of God and there's no devil to take my name out there's no demon to take me out of God's thoughts when he was there all by himself before there was a moon before there was a star he was thinking about me he was taking about you you may be seated you may be seated for a minute what mystique that had a beginning could stop the eternal plan of God for your life what could you have ever done that had a beginning when you began fornicating that to never stop the eternal plan of God for your life because sin and fornication had a beginning it would have an ending because of the eternal power of God will destroy everything everything that can be shaken will be shaken only what eternal will remain [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah may be seated the higher law of the eighth day the higher law of the eighth day Easter proved there is a higher law when they're nailed Jesus of the cross they all taught that he was dead even the devil himself understand this even the devil with all of his years of experience thought Jesus was finished and Jesus when he rose from the dead he introduced a new law that confused even the devil because while the devil is having a celebration there's a knock on the door they say oh wait a minute we invited all the VVIP to celebrate Jesus Moses was trouble Abraham was trouble he Leiter was trouble but this Jesus was real trouble so when we caught Jesus on the cross did the devil tortilla just celebrate but why the devil is celebrating there was a knock on the door this nut was not supposed to happen because under the law of the seventy when you were dead you supposed to see death but Jesus was not from the 17th so you look at me now with Zoe and I'm sixteen element but I'm not from the seventy I'm not from Trinidad I'm not from this world I'm a Leah I'm not from this world I come from God you may be seated oh Jesus he walks and open the door the devil is like who is this and here comes Jesus he knows me 2x permission because the higher law of the if he never needs to ask permission [Applause] when is the idiot just power when you speak it has to happen so Joshua was in the battle just wouldn't even understand what was going on but because he was in his Ephesus the Prophet said he was able to connect to the eighth day how many needed more light he could see strong stand still and Joshua didn't even understand the mechanics that is not the Sun that's moving is the earth that's moving but God had to translate three angels he says son standstill stop the earth move this TARDIS put things in place it didn't matter what had to happen what are some entity everything I needed something [Music] so I don't here we are chilling now right now when you recently if there and say daughter come back home God will move mountains he will move subways he will move planes up he will cancel flight plans to bring her back to the house of God you may be seated I told you I'm a spare tire I'm just here to encourage you tonight you may be seated but I pray this encourages somebody tonight to know that you have more power you have access to more power than the devil wants you to realize that everyone's gonna stay quiet and be a normal church member but this is not about church this is about you accessing who you really are when you recognize wait time wait a minute I always was I always will be because I'm a part of God and once the Holy Ghost is inside of my soul it's all over me it's keeping me alive and the Holy Ghost is what connects you to your destination and the church amen he may be seen [Applause] so under the law of seven days the Lord says because you fell in sin you're finished because you make a mistake write them off so finished but there's a higher law you may be seated there was a woman when Jesus was only yet it was not a report that was meat it was not here see there was some believers who caught her in the very act of adultery it wasn't we heard about it she was caught in the very act and they brought her to Jesus because they were thinking under the law of the seven days but when Jesus looked at the situation Jesus knowing that there's another law he didn't respond to their demands their judgments he just asked him a question you were out sin cast the first stone no problem if you want to go by the law of the seven days stone are no problem yeah but which of you witnessing you start and Jesus to not embarrass them he turned his back so that they can look at themselves it was no longer Jesus looking at them but they had to look inside and one by one they had to recognize you know what I forgot I had to go to the grocery I actually forgot my kids in school and one by one they had to go away and Jesus looked at the woman now this Vegas powerful he's a woman where they accuse us how much you look there was nobody and Jesus no against the law of the 70s which required her to be stoned said neither do I Jesus speaking later than I who come from God condemned me he introduced a higher you may be seated so when the doctor says tonight there is no hope your kiss is terminal we don't know what to do for you we don't know how to work the situation out we never saw this situation before that's the law of the seven days speaking there is a higher law from the eighth day that can heal any sickness that can perform any surgery when the family things that you can never change them they don't understand you there is a higher law when people think you're gonna give up when your marriage seems like it supposed to collapse there's a higher law when you can't pay your bills as a higher law you may be seated Jesus was not only interested in their spiritual needs but when they needed money to pay taxes he go fish they got food and when they cut the fish there was money to pay the bills because he was interested in their daily living and their lives because they were on a destination where they would need nothing you didn't hear what I said they were on a destination onto a test where they would need nothing so she was getting used to them getting provided for all of their names not what they wanted but for all of their needs that's what God does he wants to beat every need and if there's a need in your heart tonight he is able to meet whatever that means if you need healing he's able to meet that you need the Holy Ghost he's able to meet that you need to be restored he's able to meet that need you are backsliding here tonight he's able to bring you back and the church same friends we are coming to the end of time now when the message you may be seated future hope they have any bright money or think bright but the balance and how many features 110 and we read it it's called not a dispensation not 270 it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there's no more time then you go into eternity after the seven church age is over I'm Mel Abraham said and it is Luthor's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other there in eternity where there's no such things as numbers and times and things all mine you see it now so that's my hope friends and that's the same thing but the banner says he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with a fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one spirit we are all baptized into Christ and it's not appropriate message question and answers before there was a world I love this quote you in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost that settles every debatable every debate before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it and he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the dirt and he sent Jesus listen listen to the purpose to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you so the Holy Ghost has to bring you to himself can the church shame at all he said this is the church so I'm on hold now see oh this is so rich to me to think it's not what I wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I have not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started goats for us and put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life before they ever was a world talk about God so friends the purpose of the endtime message the whole purpose was to lose the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was bound in a river Euphrates for almost 2,000 years but Christ the Son of man feel and the Prophet loose the Holy Ghost loose your inheritance loose your promise but God didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall on your flesh on your ideas on your emotions on your pride because we just be Pentecostal so for all these years the Holy Ghost was disguised as the word and service after service the responsibility of ministers was to make sure that the full wood representing the mechanics was in you that's why the Prophet cause it a secret is the word is in the bride not the word is in the message ditches but the word is in the bride so how do you know who the bride is she container full would chickity correction repute chica take encouragement but I say tonight the bride has held the word seed long enough sirs is this the time for the rushing mighty wind and for individual to claim the inheritance you may be seen it for a minute I'm not gonna be too much longer at you but I want to strike something no there are times when it's got to be a group there are times you need to be a group an individual could engage Jericho took the whole army to go th Jericho are you with me so there's a season to be identified and be a group I want to read a cup of course Anamika but the man said in what was the Holy Ghost given for the same Holy Spirit that save the Lutheran's that sanctify the Methodists that baptize the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus and then why am i against organized religion but the vellum said the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the wood now this is all still group he said that oneness here we are at the end time coming from the east or west or north or south what are we doing getting ready for the rapture getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost [Applause] but by 1965 in the message of paradox but the Benham says and so has the church world in this last day it's come along it split its parts but it's coming a time with mercies it must do it there has got to come any visions also of this journey just as there was of other journeys they has come there has to come and Ephesians and Ephesus and Ephesian of this journey now but the Branham quarters that Ephesians parallels Joshua so when we read Ephesians we're reading Joshua when we be just what we read in Ephesians not only that listen carefully but the book of Ephesians is the book of trust one of the New Testament it's dividing and setting in order the overcome one so in this day and this age God is not placing any Church any group it's individuals who would possess their individual inheritance everybody with me now let me skip here we know this right is going to strike something but the Branham says here adoption how God says in the church for their labor pains and stuff like that but I want to come to a point here quite a bit here divining of the inheritance so it was after 40 years in the wilderness remember to turn him is over in the woman's for 40 years and the Bible said that for five years they fought together so after this circle of women for 40 years there was five years where they went Jericho aai they took this place they did this place and five years now just for 13 verse 1 I'm not gonna be too much longer since now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him go at all on sugar Gideon now when God says that to you the Bible is something else in him now Joshua was always feeling and the Lord said I am dull at home and stricken Indians what a word from the Lord I'm there I'm very minute yes very much land to be possessed so even though Josh with all and he's weary and he's tired and God is speaking to him without even seeing it in a in a way that we might think we have to say to make you feel not bad and say you're all used took me and but there's still land to be taken this is the land that gets remaining all the porters of the Philistines and all Kasturi from C Hall which is before Egypt even unto the borders of Akron northward which is coated to the Canaanites my Lords of the Philistines the Gaza types and the after tights and the s Canaanites the Hittites are the Accra Knights also the a fights and God is not done just will you hold your stricken in age but I want you to remember yes still more than here's an inheritance ahead of you you may be seated and it goes on from the salt all the land of the canaanites not some of the land of the canaanites but all the land of the canaanites and mara that is beside the Celia nights until effect to the borders of the amorite and I'm not done yet and the land of the tip lights and all Lebanon to what the Sun rising so when you see the sunrise in Joshua even though you old all of that land is your land [Applause] [Music] some bad human until the entering of hammett all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto miss peretta meme and all the city only then will I Drive out before the turn of Israel and this is the instruction only divided though it by lot on to the Israelites one inheritance as I have commanded me you may be seated could you take someone you see this if you take somebody with you go on a little more you may be seated everybody who knows me I'm not a long creature but this word is eating good right now so that's just what 13 so just what chapter 14 the dividing of the inheritance begins and this way I want to go to church tribe by tribe they are coming to claim their inheritance this is what I've been waiting for this is what is learned about when they were in Egypt under the whip of the taskmasters didn't you that there's a promise of a land somewhere when they walk on the Egypt this is what the sound of songs about when Miriam play the tambourine you may be seated it had not been easy because when they walked out of Egypt and they thought they would be in the land unbelief forty years distant that should have been maybe a month forty years this circled and Tyler one my one except for Joshua and Caleb it had not been easy but that generation that had been born in the wilderness all the other heard about was this promise meant while in the wilderness the Promised Land is ahead when they were marching around Jericho the Promised Land assay in the Battle of AI a promised land as ahead and after forty and five years it's being divided no the tribe of Reuben comes forward and I could see Joshua he's old you ever see that he's stricken in age what you seen that's your land and the whole tribe of Reuben near rejoice because it's been a long journey better go key but it is with it and the tribe of Reuben they have their panels they help their flags and they say we have our land and then come the tribe of Simeon then the tribe of Levi and one by one Levi didn't get a land inheritance because they're the Levites and then and they come the tribe of Judah a warrior tribe strong warriors the royal tribe the tribe from the kings of Israel came from he may be seated for a minute are you with me tonight I want you to picture a young strong confident men of Judah and their wives and their children as they feel the strength he may be see that not only with the tribe of Judah been known for its kings but this drive had one unique distinction from every other tribe there was one man among them that was just different and I can imagine as the tribe of Judah is waiting to get their portion there's a stillness in the camp and it's a shuffle that's going on and it's a lone man he's walking walk in the front and you can see the smiles of the soldiers after watching respect as this man walks to the front of the tribe of Judah and he interrupts the proceedings he interrupts what has been handed tribe by tribe the interrupt was been handed to the groups and he said listen just one for those of you who don't know my name is Caleb I was dead when we left Egypt when we went into the land I was Nick I'm the only one standing who tasted the grapes God's grace was so good I for forty five years I can't get them out of my head the milk was good the honey was good Moses promise me now give me my Mountain you maybe seen it for a minute [Applause] Tennyson he left student he said I'm not speaking for the tribe of Judah I'm speaking for myself this was a promise Moses gave to me and the church can't somebody give God a shout of praise you may be seated for a minute Caleb had a revelation now you know the challenge and the message there's a lot of people don't know the Bible so because they don't on a Bible because the Prophet was to shine light on the written word so they're people who take the prophets message and don't even read the scripture but you know how the Bible describes Caleb the rabbit called Caleb Caleb the son of Jephunneh the kena sight so it doesn't the Caleb of the tribe of Judah I'm going somewhere so some theologians argue that he Levesque there are two possibilities on the one hand they argue he could be a Gentile or the best-case scenario he could be a cousin because in genesis 1519 the covenant that God makes with Abraham includes the land of the Canaanites so in Genesis 15:18 the Bible says in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying on the dye seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river the river Euphrates the Kenites and the canaanites and the Cadman eyes and the hittites and the perizzites so caleb is off the kemacite so caleb was not of judah by natural but somewhere along the journey caleb joined the ranks not only join the ranch but i wouldn't understand this he was one of the twelve that went into the promised land so not only in the turnarounds but he was such a soldier that he rose to the top of the ranch to represent the tribe of Judah how does a man who is that born of the tribe represent the child under laws of the tribes of Israel you have to be adopted into the trial to represent the tribe to admit that Caleb had to have a character worried that the tribe of Judah can count him worthy to represent the tribe when he was not born after tribe so when the devil looks at me and say you don't look like Judah you don't look like a Christian when I thank God that he still picked me up and put me into the tribe of the family of God because I was unworthy to begin with but if he left can make it I can make it to somebody give God a shout of praise you ever seen it for a minute is this there's so much I'm driving home on the individual part of this thing it moved from the tribal the group the engine is in this church it's with this group it with these two bunch of people and caleb is like I don't want to hear that tell me where's my mountain Reuben Simeon to reduce here the tribe afterwards tell me my mountain that Moses promised me and there's a lot of lessons we could take from this man korcula that we don't know much about but we know he made it can I just read from the Bible just for 14 verse 6 then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilga and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kiner sight said of him don't know as the thing this is not some extremely you don't know it's a thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God considering me in Kadesh Barnea what he is always I'm and Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land and I brought him wood as it was in my heart nevertheless and I love listen I love this how Caleb could speak after 45 years because listen he and I'm sure should have had his mountain 45 years ago it was because of his he had to be out of his mountain for 45 years listen to how classy you may consider what a gentleman there's a man of distinction he said nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt there is no you are not hearing any animosity in in Caleb's speech he has let that go a long time ago he said you were there he is my near and my good brothers made the people's heart to melt told them the land is a hard land told them to not be desperate for the Holy Ghost told them or can a false teaching and the people got scared get lost the plan but we are here again another holy time has come we are standing on the verge of the greatest manifestations that the world has ever seen now therefore give me my Mountain [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so Sookie let didn't see my brothers I should have cut them off enough fellowship with them and those no no my brethren that went up with me fellow brothers fellow ministers I was late to come back because 10 brothers came back scared they came out quickly to give the negative reports but that's what you are you know you are nice here back to feast we came back late at night our stomachs were full the grapes were too good you may be seated but I only followed the Lord my God and Moses way on that day saying surely the land whereon divita trodden shall be thine inheritance and I cheiron's for ever because thou hast wholly followed the Lord Michael now friend you may be seated young people here that was the only man out of hundreds of thousands of people that held to the world of promise [Applause] Caleb would have lost friends he'd have lost relatives he'll have lost the people to encourage him money all these but that didn't change the revelation he had in his heart he said I won't leave but all that I am with all that I have with everything within me I wholly follow the law and Mars responds because thou has only follow the Lord it will be nine inheritance and that children's forever Caleb goes and now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he said he's forty and five years even since the Lord speak this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now law I am this deer four score and five years old 85 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I wasn't a deer at Moses simple and fringe that stream that Caleb was speaking about was much as physical strength I believe it was more than that it was a strength of character there was a strength of purpose it was a strength of determination as my strength was now even so as my strength now for boat to go out and to come in it and now this is my friend now therefore give me this mountain we're at the Lord speaking that day without hurting that the oleanna comes were there and that cities were great and offensive so be the Lord will be with me then I shall do the drive them out has the Lord you may be seated [Applause] I'm not going to be too much longer the musician can get ready so friends we are bringing it to possessing your individual inheritance and we have been living by the evidence of the new land it's a good land it's a land of poet sir it's a land of grace it's a land of possibility it's a land of restoration is a land enough of redemption and any man in the message of paradox that believes God and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another paradox to keep his word so what about our thing we have a mountain to possess a mountain from feet all the way to charity that's statue of a perfect man that's that's our mountain people don't want to talk about that much anymore because the goal of that mountain you have to pass brotherly kindness and that's the part of the mountain people when they reached here they whether the message perfect rang by proving weakness but a Branham said all God's strategies to take human vessels and shake the world with them like a Pentecost that's easy at Pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but they were all standing there with their vessels turning up and God took him cells and fill them up they shook the world poured himself into them that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty vessels yes sir so God can fill them up God kind of use them as they are already filled up if you're full of theological training God can't use you God's got to have empty vessels so you can fill them in the message speak to this mountain the prophecy I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into severe now and that's gonna shake the whole world that's the first time it's bins in the days of Jesus of Nazareth today human being asked anything that you will and it shall be given unto you oh it's gonna come to pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she rise to our feet like a mighty marching army the sick will be here by a word the blind will see the Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised up on the power of God but shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now be encouraged tonight friends you didn't call yourself God called you the Holy Spirit knows where you live where you work what time you leave in the morning what'd you have for breakfast he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you and the Holy Ghost comes to give you power that's what the Holy Ghost is for oh my the Holy Ghost come to give you power in the mess of what the Holy Ghost given for you could be gonna play something softly the Holy Ghost comes to give you power power in pray you take a person that's lived a good life but it's not about land he said they're always defeated oh I tell you I sure love the Lord by the brand I'm always defeated they've never get a prayer answered you fill that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch what takes place when she called before god she's not defeated she come boldly to the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God might take that little man so cowardly the boss kick him all over the place he wait a minute here now something's changed see he got the Holy Ghost he gives you power your life is full of power and finally when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one place in one Accord god I'd walked above them in the fiery cloudy I'd walk with them on the earth now something else was gonna take place something's fixin to happen they were all in one place in one Accord and suddenly they came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty waited until all the room where they were sitting friends I don't know the need of everyone here tonight I don't know what trials you've had and what situations you had to endure but I know God is able he's able to meet every year he's able to change every situation around he's able to pour the holy lawsuit brother balance at the theme of every apostle has been have you received the Holy Ghost since you and if I have one desire in my heart for this meeting is to see individuals come into contact with the supernatural my prayer in this holy time is one small Lord that individuals don't see the need to possess their individual inheritance the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have that peace of eternal life drop down into the sockets of your soul friends many people have lost the burden for the Holy Ghost they accept teaching as a substitute for the Holy Ghost they accept being a member of the church as a substitute for the whole news they accept affiliations as a substitute for the Holy Ghost but there is no substitute for the baptism of the Holy Ghost going to church every day is no substitute for the Holy Ghost which is God's all life dropping inside of your soul I know the young people here they are Caleb's here there David what never had
