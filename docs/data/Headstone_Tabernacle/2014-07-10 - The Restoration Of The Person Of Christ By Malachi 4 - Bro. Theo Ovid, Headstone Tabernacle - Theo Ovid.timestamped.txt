[8:28] 17
[8:36] and Jesus when he was baptized went up
[8:38] straight way out of the water and lo the
[8:40] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[8:43] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[8:46] and lighting upon him and L a voice from
[8:50] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[8:54] whom I'm well
[8:55] pleased Matthew chapter
[8:58] 17
[9:00] and after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter
[9:02] James and John his brother and bringeth
[9:03] them up onto a high mountain apart and
[9:06] was transfigured before them his face
[9:09] was shine as the sun his rainment as
[9:11] white as the light and behold he
[9:13] appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[9:15] talking with him then answered Peter and
[9:18] said unto Jesus lord it's good for us to
[9:20] be here if thou Wilt let us make here
[9:23] three Tabernacles one for thee one for
[9:25] Moses and one for Elias while he yet
[9:29] speak Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed
[9:33] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[9:37] which said this is my beloved Son in
[9:41] whom I am well pleased he ye him let us
[9:45] pray father we thank you for your word
[9:47] tonight and Lord you're trying to get
[9:49] sons from Matthew 3 to graduate to
[9:52] Matthew 17 where is not just this is my
[9:55] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased but
[9:58] three more words are added hear ye Him
[10:01] Father a son placed in a position of
[10:03] authority and power and that son has to
[10:06] be a son that has your character that
[10:09] has your nature that has your life Lord
[10:12] your Prophet taught us that power
[10:14] without character is satanic and We Know
[10:17] by the word that you're looking to try
[10:19] sons and prove Sons to bring them into a
[10:22] place of adoption help us tonight as we
[10:25] approach your word help us tonight and
[10:28] we invite you Holy Spirit to bring
[10:30] Insight divine revelation inspiration
[10:34] upon your word speak to every heart here
[10:36] tonight confirm your word with signs
[10:39] wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus
[10:41] name amen and amen you may be seated as
[10:44] I give the Lord some
[10:52] worship title to title tonight the
[10:54] restoration of the person of Christ by
[10:57] Malachi 4 oh bless blessed be the name
[11:00] of the Lord the restoration of the
[11:02] person of Christ by Malachi 4 on Sunday
[11:06] we were talking about just a small recap
[11:08] that there where the Pentecostal people
[11:10] made a mistake we think as soon as we
[11:12] become sons and daughters that settles
[11:14] it we just come into a place of trying
[11:17] the Methodist said as soon as they
[11:19] shouted the Lutheran said the believe on
[11:21] by faith no matter what kind of position
[11:23] God put you in you are still growing you
[11:26] are still going on to perfection
[11:29] isn't that right now remember the Holy
[11:32] Spirit has got to bring God everything
[11:34] that every professing Christian say
[11:36] about it so that means that the Son of
[11:40] God Jesus when he got off the water he
[11:42] began to be tried and tested as a son
[11:44] isn't that right he said what are you
[11:46] preaching that for brother brandham I
[11:48] want to see the Church of God in deep
[11:49] sincerity I want to see the oldfashioned
[11:52] preens I want to see The Times They
[11:54] can't leave the church they want to stay
[11:56] all night and pray and fast and call out
[11:59] till God answers instead of that it
[12:01] seemed the love have dwindled away from
[12:03] us the love of God now he spoke about
[12:06] the negative when the son didn't behave
[12:08] himself but he said but if the boy then
[12:11] then he's still a son now we not talking
[12:13] about serpent seed we not talking about
[12:14] false anointed ones we're not talking
[12:16] about false prophets we're not talking
[12:17] about second Timothy he and high minded
[12:19] lovers of we're not talking about that
[12:21] we are still speaking about Sons and
[12:24] Daughters of God Sons and Daughters of
[12:27] God not evil people not evil workers not
[12:29] Shock we talking about sons and da how
[12:32] many understand that tonight we are not
[12:34] talking about negative we only talking
[12:35] about the bride the Sons and Daughters
[12:37] of God rather I want to say the Sons and
[12:39] Daughters of God now watch this now now
[12:43] this the boy if he come up the way and
[12:45] didn't what did not obedient did not
[12:47] have the action of his father did not
[12:50] carry his father's business on the way
[12:53] his father did then that child missed
[12:56] all its inheritance another brother had
[12:59] to take its place that's a powerful one
[13:02] now today if we try to take the church
[13:04] before God under a common Creed we all
[13:06] believe the same thing believe some
[13:07] scripture or theology that's not the way
[13:11] Jesus Took the church before the father
[13:13] God wants the church the part we have to
[13:16] kick with how God wants the church not
[13:18] how man have it not how people like it
[13:20] no but how God wants it God wants the
[13:23] church before God watch God wants the
[13:25] church to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[13:29] that's God's will not you come and just
[13:31] get baptized not you come and occupy a
[13:33] Pew not you come and shake the pastor's
[13:35] hand and get a free Bible no not that's
[13:37] not what he wants he wants the church
[13:39] filled with the with the Holy Ghost
[13:42] could we say amen he want the church
[13:45] filled with the Holy Ghost watch watch
[13:47] doing the same works that he did when he
[13:50] was here on Earth that's the kind of
[13:53] church that the teacher the holy spirit
[13:56] will want to present before God
[13:59] he don't want to say we just Gathering
[14:01] he want to say we have the same life the
[14:03] same signs the same wonders this church
[14:05] looking like it ready to take off this
[14:08] church looking like it ready for the
[14:09] Rapture Express that's the kind of
[14:11] church he's coming for that church could
[14:14] only have 12 people in it it don't have
[14:15] to have 100 it don't have to have 50
[14:17] people but I'm say if the church stood
[14:19] original we wouldn't have more than 50
[14:21] but the people Will Be Blood wash and
[14:23] the word will be spoken word by word by
[14:26] word amen amen oh hallelujah hallelujah
[14:31] remember what Isaac preached Su the
[14:32] evening that guy with the flag and he's
[14:35] going on to the hearts of the enemy and
[14:37] the people were losing the battle and
[14:38] they said bring back the flag he said no
[14:40] bring up the men Hallelujah that's what
[14:43] we need stop lowering the standard bring
[14:46] up the men raise a standard there going
[14:50] to be a perfect church I much Devils
[14:53] walk the earth there's going to be Sons
[14:55] and Daughters of the Living
[14:57] God
[14:59] and don't care what child you have been
[15:01] through
[15:02] amen that's the thing God will do to his
[15:05] sons on Earth someday he will call you a
[15:07] side church amen if you will obey him
[15:11] and stay on the word and believe it he
[15:14] will place into the church and that's
[15:16] what we have to look for he will place
[15:18] into the church before the coming of
[15:20] Jesus Christ he will place into the
[15:22] church all the power that Christ had in
[15:24] him will be in the church Hallelujah all
[15:27] of us in God he Christ all of us in
[15:29] Christ he poured into the church isn't
[15:31] that right the father wanted a work done
[15:33] he poured into the son the son want to
[15:35] work done he pour it into the church and
[15:38] what the same power that rest in Jesus
[15:40] Christ rest in placed sons in the body
[15:44] of Christ that means that there going to
[15:47] be some sons that going to be placed not
[15:49] by a convention not by man but by God
[15:52] himself he will call you aside as a son
[15:56] this is my beloved Son Give the Lord

[23:23] is exactly with the word we know our
[23:26] teaching is perfect with the word adding
[23:29] nothing taking nothing just the word and
[23:31] we see the same results that others who
[23:34] are anchored to the same word living up
[23:37] in our life then your anchor
[23:40] holds the Life of Christ being
[23:43] reproduced in an almost incarnate way
[23:46] through you as it was in Christ because
[23:49] it was God in Christ reconciling the
[23:52] world to himself oh Hallelujah sit still
[23:56] little flop positionally stay where you
[23:58] are as sister Gertie said used to sing
[24:00] Keep Holding On don't worry God is
[24:02] waiting and trying and pressing to get
[24:05] the mystery of God revealed to the
[24:09] church that is what is holding back the
[24:11] coming of Christ and the great
[24:13] Millennium is this great Supernatural
[24:15] power that really lays dormant in the
[24:17] church question if Christ is to come and
[24:21] he is waiting for this Supernatural
[24:23] power that lays dormant in this church
[24:25] only when that power is activated it
[24:28] brings an attraction to Christ oh
[24:31] hallelujah it's almost like an outer
[24:33] space business that we have something to
[24:35] beam out and when we beam out that thing
[24:38] that big spacecraft out there that big
[24:40] Rapture Express out there going to get a
[24:43] signal on the earth that we are ready to

[26:25] church he is in the house of the people
[26:27] in that church we see God we know God we
[26:31] experience God he is moving In and Out
[26:34] Among Us oh give the Lord some Praises
[26:36] that's the church he wants to identify

[26:43] brother Brandon we have seen his star he
[26:46] said watch he said now watch my word in
[26:49] you you abide in me my words abide in
[26:51] you ask what you will that is Christ in
[26:54] you are you ready now this was heavy
[26:56] stuff I was to preaching Sunday couldn't
[26:58] get through was more pastoral but this
[26:59] is stuff we got to get it tonight
[27:02] hallelujah praise God now watch he said
[27:05] that's Christ in you anointing the word
[27:07] for this age whatever age watch you they
[27:11] lived in God divided his word to ages
[27:14] God divided his word into ages isn't
[27:19] that right are you with me and every
[27:22] time it comes that time the church all
[27:24] scrupled up and God anoints somebody
[27:28] send it down he this to make the word
[27:31] act not more
[27:34] talk hallelujah hallelujah God send the
[27:39] anointing to anoint somebody to make the
[27:42] word what to make the word act watch
[27:46] watch to make the word act just exactly
[27:49] the way he said it did amen there's a
[27:51] word prophesy of this day and God is
[27:54] waiting for somebody to find somebody
[27:56] it's not to un usual to that they can be
[27:59] Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove
[28:02] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[28:05] today and forever so you mean the
[28:07] anointing of the Holy Ghost it must have
[28:10] to come to prove he's the same yesterday
[28:13] today and forever so you will see how
[28:15] far this theological intellectual
[28:18] intellectually call it gymnastics
[28:19] flipping here and flipping there is
[28:21] irrelevant to the mystery of God to be
[28:24] expressed you would see how far it is
[28:27] from the real thing because the Bible
[28:29] said in the beginning was the word the
[28:31] word was with God and the Word was God
[28:34] but then something happened and the word
[28:36] became flesh and dwell Among Us that was
[28:39] the mystery of God being
[28:42] revealed oh hallelujah oh glory to God

[34:07] Baptist he came in an in between age
[34:10] there was the all up to Malachi there
[34:12] was no prophets isn't that right Messiah
[34:15] was promised and in between there they
[34:18] had a history of Sadducees scribes
[34:20] Pharisees isin all of them amen bunch of
[34:23] interpretation theology traditions and
[34:26] there were in their ways for many many
[34:28] years John getting a different name from
[34:31] the Levi and the all different kind of
[34:33] Jewish names he get John call him John
[34:35] God wanted that name John that was a
[34:37] disturbance by itself just the name
[34:39] because he wasn't on the regular kind
[34:41] like ezekiah Jeremiah Zachariah you know
[34:44] different kind of thing say call him
[34:45] John put John on there let the name
[34:47] alone trouble them Hallelujah John is
[34:50] down there John and then next God said
[34:52] thr him in the wilderness he have a
[34:54] passion for the Wilderness why the
[34:55] scriptures say voice of Cry of
[34:57] wilderness so God put a Wilderness
[34:59] scorpion man Wilderness rugged Man
[35:02] Wilderness honey man eating bees and
[35:05] honey whatever it is Wilderness man to
[35:07] come out of the Wilderness and say
[35:09] repent Hallelujah because the Kingdom of
[35:11] Heaven is at hand oh John was rocking
[35:14] them and shaking them up he was bringing
[35:17] something different they expected
[35:19] something to go in continuity with what
[35:21] was there before and John was
[35:23] interrupting it was an interruption
[35:26] praise God it was a hallelujah praise
[35:29] God with a seal about to break a Seal
[35:32] Seal is spiritual Interruption Church
[35:34] interrupted Church rocking and John John
[35:38] just in coming to introduce Messiah and
[35:41] when they thought he was hot he said
[35:42] there was one standing among you that
[35:44] man he going to baptize you with the
[35:46] Holy Ghost on Fire if you think I just
[35:49] come to do something I I this is small
[35:52] I'm not worthy to unloose his shoes but
[35:55] fire com and Power coming the glory
[35:58] coming Dynamic is coming oh how quicking
[36:01] Power is coming I can feel it tonight
[36:03] it's coming it's here the Dynamics is
[36:07] here and so are the mechanics if we
[36:09] could just get started I hope you get
[36:12] started tonight I hope you rise up and
[36:14] begin to anoint your promises to
[36:16] yourself
[36:18] tonight oh glory to God Glory
[36:24] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory
[36:27] all right let's go man events made clear
[36:30] by prophecy you are Gene of your father
[36:32] and you were in your father yet your
[36:34] father had no Fellowship in you so in
[36:36] gene form there is no Fellowship but
[36:39] watch but there was a beding ground he
[36:41] was he manifested you that you could
[36:44] have fellowship with you so in the
[36:46] natural you in the gene of your father
[36:48] and then through a womb isn't that right
[36:50] sperman come together you become
[36:51] expressed manifest and when you become
[36:53] expressed you still can't get Fellowship
[36:55] yet until you grow up until he could
[36:57] walk and talk and and get words isn't
[36:59] that right and the same way we were in
[37:01] his jeans we were in his thoughts we
[37:03] could not fellowship with our father so
[37:05] he make us bypass what he offering drop
[37:08] us down on Earth and say them son going
[37:10] to come out in their age in their time
[37:15] in their season in their dispensation
[37:18] and we are going to have
[37:21] Fellowship oh give the Lord some Praises
[37:23] people now I don't know if I want to get
[37:25] it it but Luther was in the womb wesi
[37:28] was in the womb even the Pentecostal was
[37:31] in the womb that's why the Mysteries
[37:33] couldn't be made known to them so
[37:35] therefore God can not fellowship with
[37:36] them because they were in the womb but
[37:39] when Malachi for came he came to release
[37:42] that came to bring a b that we could be
[37:45] born in this hour that we could grow up
[37:48] in this hour that God could say this is
[37:50] my son he is alive he is born oh give
[37:54] the Lord some praises God going to have
[37:57] some
[38:01] fellowship Oh Glory
[38:03] Hallelujah but oh you know I saying that
[38:06] that's the next quote right here I don't
[38:09] know if I get it it's right here
[38:10] question and answers here when you use
[38:13] the Expression if we do not believe the
[38:15] word we will be eternally separated from
[38:17] Christ do you mean the foolish virgin
[38:20] will live eternally but they will be
[38:22] separated from the New Jerusalem where
[38:24] Christ will dwell with the bride here
[38:26] are those who do not have the Holy
[38:28] Spirit born again as the scripture
[38:30] speaks of being born again there's a
[38:32] question if the natural birth requires
[38:34] water blood and spirit does the
[38:36] spiritual birth requires all three
[38:40] stages of grace before the person is
[38:41] truly born again he said absolutely amen
[38:45] he says uh absolutely I just explained
[38:49] that this morning you've got to have all
[38:52] stages you are begotten of the spirit
[38:56] just like a baby is begotten in the
[38:58] mother's womb but not born until they
[39:02] receive the Holy Ghost you are born then
[39:06] you are not converted you are in the
[39:08] process of being converted until that
[39:11] time here we go that's the reason that
[39:15] all these great Mysteries could not be
[39:17] given to Luther could not be given to
[39:20] Wesley could not be given to the age
[39:24] that just passed by us Pentecostal age
[39:28] why it wasn't time they were
[39:31] begotten now the person of Christ
[39:35] himself the son of man revealing himself
[39:38] in human flesh it could not have come
[39:40] till that
[39:44] time so therefore God was waiting for
[39:46] this special bride age to bring on the
[39:50] Mysteries Hallelujah to the sons isn't
[39:53] that right he says now he said
[39:56] justification by faith was a wide sphere
[39:58] and we never move from that Along Came
[40:00] Wesley John Wesley it shook them down
[40:03] and down and brought her down to
[40:04] sanctification live a good clean life
[40:07] sanctify by the word of God give joy in
[40:08] your heart that shook a lot of Lutheran
[40:11] Doctrine then Along Came the Pentecost
[40:13] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[40:15] narrowed on again and the gifts and the
[40:17] restoration and the spirit of God had
[40:19] come in in the fullness of signs and
[40:21] wonders into the church and That Shook
[40:23] Pentecost what is it we are so close to
[40:25] the coming of Jesus until here we
[40:28] go people talking about the Trump and
[40:31] talking about the coming of the Lord but
[40:32] listen this we are so close to the
[40:34] coming of the Lord Jesus watch until the
[40:37] very same spirit that was in him is
[40:40] working in the
[40:41] church not more teachings it have to
[40:46] move from word to Spirit we have to see
[40:49] the spirit itself beginning to work
[40:52] Hallelujah watch watch until working in
[40:54] the church doing doing the very same
[40:56] things he did that he was here on Earth
[40:58] it's never been anywhere back from the
[41:00] time of the Apostle till this time why
[41:03] it's narrow it Narrows what is it here
[41:06] we go just like your hand come into a
[41:08] shadow negative negative well it's a
[41:10] reflection what was Luther so you put
[41:12] Luther as a reflection on your hand but
[41:14] as you get nearer it coming closer to
[41:16] the to the real thing isn't that right
[41:18] isn't that right the shadow blending it
[41:20] with the real thing so watch what was
[41:22] Luther a reflection of Christ what was
[41:24] Bley a reflection of Christ but we the
[41:26] end Time Each man looked at the end of
[41:28] his Junction for the coming of Christ
[41:30] but they had to look forward to the
[41:32] return of the Jews flying sources in the
[41:34] skies all the things that we see today
[41:36] we at the end time we are here now they
[41:38] know here we go they know the church was
[41:42] to receive a power that would work in
[41:44] the church the same works of Christ
[41:47] because as a shadow becomes deeper and
[41:49] deeper you take a sh shade further away
[41:52] from the shade the least reflection you
[41:53] get of the shade and while the shade get
[41:55] closer to the tree the shade is the same
[41:58] thing now the spirit that work under
[42:01] justification and Luther sanctification
[42:03] under Wesley baptism of Holy Ghost under
[42:06] the Pentecost and here it is in the last
[42:08] day performing and doing the very same
[42:12] thing that he did when it was in Christ
[42:14] what is it the church and Christ has
[42:17] become
[42:18] one so he's identifying his ministry as
[42:22] a sign of the church and Christ becoming
[42:24] one isn't that right now here we go and
[42:27] watch they will connect together and she
[42:29] will go through the sky shouting up will
[42:31] come Wesley Lu to all the rest of them
[42:33] back there and he that is first will be
[42:36] last and last will be first and they'll
[42:38] come a resurrection we are the end time
[42:40] what was the Holy Ghost what the Holy
[42:42] Ghost does excuse me the Holy Ghost by
[42:45] justification see a light shadow of it
[42:47] the Holy Ghost by sanctification a
[42:49] deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by
[42:51] the baptism a deeper Shadow now the Holy
[42:55] Ghost here we go by the restoration of
[42:58] its very person being
[43:00] here performing signs and wonders like
[43:03] he did at the beginning he said who
[43:06] Glory call call me Holy Roller you may
[43:08] as well get started right
[43:09] now so justification Shadow
[43:12] sanctification Shadow baptism Shadow but
[43:15] the restoration of the person that's the
[43:17] real
[43:18] thing oh let me say this way
[43:20] justification made a way for
[43:22] sanctification sanctification made way
[43:24] for the Battle of Holy Ghost and the
[43:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[43:28] the Holy Ghost
[43:31] itself that is your
[43:34] promise oh
[43:36] Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[43:39] from Paradox what is it Christ coming to
[43:42] his body here we go I'm not talking
[43:45] about false anointed I'm not talking
[43:47] about second Timothy I'm not talking
[43:49] about false prophets I'm not talking

[59:02] clear in your heart and mind is not
[59:04] coming down here to church to take notes
[59:07] amen it has to come to a point where you
[59:10] have to take note that they have been
[59:12] with Jesus it's a different kind of note
[59:14] for years people writing and they trying
[59:16] to educate theel and understand this
[59:18] mystery and understand that mystery and
[59:19] they want to know more mystery the Bible
[59:21] said in the last days they shall Heap
[59:23] unto themselves teachers
[59:25] having itting ears they want to hear
[59:27] every new thing every new revelation
[59:29] every new stuff but that's not what it's
[59:32] all about that's why said knowledge
[59:34] shall increase not just natural science
[59:36] but even spiritual knowledge but it's
[59:38] not just to have knowledge in the form
[59:40] of knowledge no knowledge has to come by
[59:43] Revelation that knowledge there in the
[59:46] virtues is not intellectual knowledge
[59:48] that is not chemistry and biology and
[59:50] physics and logic and whatnot that's
[59:52] God's knowledge that's the knowledge to
[59:54] know that God can't lie that God will
[59:57] keep his word that's the knowledge of
[59:59] God that God can't fail and he's the
[1:00:02] same yated in Forever that's the
[1:00:04] knowledge of God hallelujah that God is
[1:00:07] a liive and he's in the Affairs of men
[1:00:11] God is Not Invisible and and away from
[1:00:15] he's actively working among his
[1:00:18] people are you with
[1:00:20] me watch brother Bram he's talking about
[1:00:24] the Revival and they asked the police
[1:00:26] man where is the Revival and he tipped
[1:00:28] his heart he says sir the weth Revival
[1:00:30] is in here pointing to his heart it's in
[1:00:32] me and then B say oh God yeah oh God if
[1:00:36] we can only understand that we are the
[1:00:39] reflection of Jesus Christ his word made
[1:00:42] manifest you are the reflection of his
[1:00:45] word and today here we go the church
[1:00:48] ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon
[1:00:50] the Earth because I live you shall live
[1:00:52] also isn't that right I'm going
[1:00:55] notice
[1:00:56] Hallelujah so the church ought to be
[1:00:58] what Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ in
[1:01:02] action some people have got so natural
[1:01:04] so Canal so ordinary just like life
[1:01:08] living
[1:01:12] life you know it's something something
[1:01:14] you hear me spoke about before people
[1:01:16] who get money suddenly whether by
[1:01:18] Lottery by whatever lot whatever it is
[1:01:20] within 7 years or so 70% of them lose
[1:01:23] all yes because they don't feel it will
[1:01:26] finish so they SPL they spin they thing
[1:01:30] like that they don't feel it was done
[1:01:31] they don't see the mind have so much
[1:01:33] that it wouldn't go down and this is the
[1:01:36] problem of life people don't people
[1:01:38] don't believe that they would have to
[1:01:39] leave this earth that to pack up sh they
[1:01:41] believe they live here forever so they
[1:01:43] could fight and F and quarrel and hold
[1:01:46] ODS and Grudge and they going down the
[1:01:50] road amen never seeing that there's an
[1:01:53] end of time
[1:01:55] never seeing that we only have a slot to
[1:01:57] do our do and do all that we can do
[1:01:59] Hallelujah it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:02:02] righteousness here we go let me just
[1:02:04] shake it a little bit now as we get to
[1:02:05] the I would say close yet but home
[1:02:08] stretch now watch notice there's many
[1:02:11] people just can't believe it even
[1:02:15] spiritual fill people I'm going to give
[1:02:17] you one that will choke
[1:02:19] you this is to choke you he said this is
[1:02:22] one to choke you the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:25] Ghost don't mean you're going
[1:02:27] in not at all not on that don't have
[1:02:32] anything to do with your soul that's the
[1:02:36] baptism but there's a inside Soul there
[1:02:39] that's got to come from
[1:02:41] God oh
[1:02:43] hallelujah oh praise the name of the
[1:02:46] Lord that's why you should be shouting
[1:02:49] tonight hallelujah praise God your
[1:02:52] Insight insight watch he said remember
[1:02:55] in that Spirit you can be baptized with
[1:02:57] the genuine spirit of God and still be
[1:02:59] lost it's the soul that lives so like a
[1:03:03] seed you have three parts you have a
[1:03:06] soul you have a spirit and you have a
[1:03:09] body you can be baptized in your spirit
[1:03:11] still not make it but that soul that
[1:03:14] seed that germ that comes from godall
[1:03:17] you didn't start that God started that
[1:03:21] God placed you in the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:23] Life
[1:03:24] you are a gene taught in his mind before
[1:03:29] it became word that was your Gene taught
[1:03:32] that was your soul back in God isn't
[1:03:36] that right and that soul that seed is
[1:03:40] what God put inside of you and put you
[1:03:42] in dirt and plant you on the earth and
[1:03:46] let the devil take you are just one of
[1:03:47] them normal seeds but you are a
[1:03:51] mystery Hallelujah and the Mystery is in
[1:03:54] your history where you come from where
[1:03:58] was thou when I lay the foundation of
[1:03:59] the earth and the morning I sang
[1:04:02] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:04:04] Joy you was not you didn't come in the
[1:04:07] beginning you were there before the
[1:04:09] beginning that's where you come from
[1:04:12] that's where your anointing comes from
[1:04:14] that's where your tan is at before there
[1:04:17] was a moon before there was a star
[1:04:20] before there was a word you would have
[1:04:22] thought that was in God and a word is a
[1:04:25] thought expressed so when God want to
[1:04:27] express you he expressed the word and
[1:04:31] the word is God so that's why when you
[1:04:34] hear the word there is an instant
[1:04:36] connection you can't help it if it's
[1:04:39] something that's built inside of you you
[1:04:42] can't even control it it is just
[1:04:45] something that's inside of you you are a
[1:04:48] thought that God has expressed by his
[1:04:52] word oh glory to God
[1:04:56] and it could only be a word if you was a
[1:04:58] taught to begin with oh you had to be a
[1:05:01] taught to become word to become word you
[1:05:05] have to be a jean T oh give the Lord
[1:05:08] some Praises
[1:05:11] people that is why you ought to be
[1:05:13] shouting every service praising God
[1:05:15] every service that is why in the upper
[1:05:17] room there were dry seeds in the upper
[1:05:20] room there were dry wood in the upper
[1:05:22] room waiting for the Spirit to fall and
[1:05:25] when the spirit Begin to Fall they begin
[1:05:27] to St like drunk men oh Hallelujah

[1:05:45] wine there was stimulated by the
[1:05:47] revelation of the Holy Ghost coming upon
[1:05:50] them there's going to be another
[1:05:51] stimulation there's going to be another

[1:06:23] people don't even believe in the
[1:06:25] Bost they believe they have the seat in
[1:06:27] his soul and that's it but Peter didn't
[1:06:29] say I have the seat in his soul are go
[1:06:30] on uper room I don't need that Peter
[1:06:33] didn't say that Peter had his seed in

[1:18:07] Holy Ghost because they generate a
[1:18:09] certain thing you hang with the wrong

[1:24:43] nothing against them not at all but this
[1:24:45] is the age you have got to accept the
[1:24:47] person of Christ which is the word amen
[1:24:50] oh Lord my goodness could I five more
[1:24:54] minutes
[1:24:56] again Christ Mission got revealed bam
[1:24:58] said the new birth then what is it now
[1:25:00] look look Christ in you makes him the
[1:25:02] center of life of the Revelation Christ
[1:25:05] life in you makes him the center of the
[1:25:08] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:25:11] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:25:13] here we go now Christ in you makes you
[1:25:16] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:25:20] thing no I know you didn't get that amen
[1:25:23] amen all the Mysteries all the teachings
[1:25:26] all the things that that sum UPS into
[1:25:29] Christ in
[1:25:31] you what's the new bir then brother
[1:25:34] brandham what is the new birth it is a
[1:25:35] revelation of Christ personally to you
[1:25:38] not you join church not you shook your
[1:25:40] hand or anything like that what is it
[1:25:43] here we go you say well I'm Lutheran I'm
[1:25:44] Baptist I'm Presbyterian that don't mean
[1:25:47] a thing to God you're in the message
[1:25:50] that doesn't mean a thing to God god
[1:25:53] listen to what this here now what is it
[1:25:56] are you ready it is Christ being
[1:26:01] revealed and he is the word and when the
[1:26:06] word is revealed it expresses
[1:26:14] itself now people only create Revelation
[1:26:17] with information knowledge and talk
[1:26:19] ification I know there not a word
[1:26:21] talking
[1:26:22] yapping they could talk it they talk in
[1:26:25] Revelation but when Christ is
[1:26:28] revealed it is
[1:26:30] expressed so that's the purpose of Jesus
[1:26:34] Christ to express himself so all these
[1:26:37] Services teachings words is to
[1:26:41] eventually become flesh in you that
[1:26:45] Christ comes out of you that people
[1:26:48] could take note that you have been with
[1:26:51] Jesus because Peter couldn't even write
[1:26:53] his name the Bible said they were
[1:26:55] ignorant and unlearned but they had to
[1:26:58] take note that they had been with Jesus
[1:27:01] because Christ Was Made Alive made
[1:27:03] manifest in them as was in
[1:27:09] Moses these guys had no CXC no GC no
[1:27:12] passes no University degree no Masters
[1:27:14] nothing like that but they had Christ in
[1:27:16] them listen you know who he Christ is
[1:27:19] the mystery of God living in them and
[1:27:23] that is what got to live in you so you
[1:27:25] see when you have that there is no
[1:27:27] Baptist Methodist there's no argument
[1:27:29] the manifestation is the
[1:27:31] interpretation Oh Glory to God here we
[1:27:34] go I'm almost done watch so Christ
[1:27:36] expressing himself in the individual
[1:27:39] whether he's intellectual whether he
[1:27:40] don't know his ABC half the Apostle
[1:27:43] didn't know it but they know Christ am
[1:27:45] so the new but is a revelation God has
[1:27:48] revealed to you this Grace mystery it's
[1:27:50] a personal individual Fe with the person
[1:27:53] that Christ is revealed to them so this
[1:27:56] Mo group inspiration this make May group
[1:27:59] think group theology this is you and God
[1:28:02] not you and your family not you and your
[1:28:04] brethren not you and this group in and
[1:28:07] small group and and and we gather
[1:28:09] together and we believe this it have no
[1:28:10] we believe it is Christ expressing
[1:28:13] himself through you do you believe that
[1:28:16] hear this part now if you say I know you
[1:28:19] heard this before but it will come fresh
[1:28:20] tonight if you say he has been revealed
[1:28:24] to me and the life that Christ produced
[1:28:27] here in the Bible does not produce
[1:28:30] itself in you you got the wrong
[1:28:33] Revelation oh Hallelujah so the
[1:28:37] Revelation brings the
[1:28:39] life the real Revelation that's why the
[1:28:43] Bible B about these divinely revealed
[1:28:45] mystery truths is what will literally
[1:28:48] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:28:49] the faith of the fathers so we
[1:28:51] understand now people have more
[1:28:52] intellectual Faith than real revelation
[1:28:55] of the Holy Ghost coming down inside
[1:28:58] their faith because that will give you
[1:29:00] an anchor when the Storm come you'll be
[1:29:02] anchored Paul said it this way what can
[1:29:04] separate me from the love of God that is
[1:29:06] in Christ Jesus shall persecution shall
[1:29:09] pressure shall think nothing present
[1:29:11] nothing to come going to separate me
[1:29:13] from that goal from that love from that
[1:29:20] purpose watch
[1:29:22] wow and the life of Christ is projecting
[1:29:24] itself through you with the pinenes to
[1:29:26] the people and they see the very Life
[1:29:28] Works signs wonders what he did watch
[1:29:30] outside of that the rest of it is not
[1:29:32] even called to watch by lack of this
[1:29:34] Revelation is why we are so much
[1:29:37] divisions and so much mockery so much
[1:29:39] divisions because the people lack the
[1:29:42] Revelation they lack Revelation the
[1:29:43] teachers so because the teachers don't
[1:29:45] have the Revelation teaching all kind of
[1:29:47] crazy stuff all kind of foolish stuff
[1:29:50] and the people taking the stuff T to say
[1:29:52] I am right you are wrong we are higher
[1:29:54] you are lower we are in front you are
[1:29:56] behind we have something you
[1:29:58] don't and there a bunch of immaturity
[1:30:01] that God can't come and confirm no
[1:30:03] foolishness like that God will strip
[1:30:06] people strip Isaiah strip this one and
[1:30:09] strip that one Jesus went through three
[1:30:11] 30 years of hard trials three half years
[1:30:12] of harder trials to get an approved son
[1:30:15] why because character is not a gift am
[1:30:19] we could never overemphasize that
[1:30:21] character is the victory you can't pay
[1:30:23] for character you can't bribe for
[1:30:25] character you can't pass money for
[1:30:26] character you can say you have this and
[1:30:28] you get character praise God most of the
[1:30:30] time people with a lot of stuff have no
[1:30:32] character
[1:30:33] Hallelujah after they get blessed they
[1:30:35] get arrogant they get proud everything
[1:30:37] else God had to break people the Bible
[1:30:39] say Jesus learned obedience by the thing
[1:30:40] that he suffered God wants character but
[1:30:43] character is not a gift God can't give
[1:30:46] you that you have to overcome something
[1:30:49] that's why the trial after a while
[1:30:51] become the the greatest thing in your
[1:30:53] life because every trial means an
[1:30:55] opportunity for victory every trial
[1:30:57] means an opportunity to be changed every
[1:30:59] trial mean an opportunity for your
[1:31:01] nature to be
[1:31:03] affected Glory so you're not afraid of
[1:31:06] the storms you're not afraid of the
[1:31:08] battle you stand like a man answer me
[1:31:11] where was thou
[1:31:13] hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so but
[1:31:17] say You must be born again he says a
[1:31:18] great subject because you can't
[1:31:20] understand the kingdom to approach the
[1:31:22] birth you've got to go through a process
[1:31:24] just like anything in our lives you've
[1:31:26] got to die to go through the born again
[1:31:28] Watch just two more things you cannot
[1:31:30] keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep
[1:31:32] your same habits you cannot keep your
[1:31:34] same thoughts you've got to die how many
[1:31:37] understand you cannot have your way you
[1:31:39] have your way in your mother house not
[1:31:40] in the house of God God have no spoiled
[1:31:42] children you will be a son you'll be a
[1:31:44] daughter but you'll have no inheritance
[1:31:46] youve got to die you have got to die
[1:31:50] die amen
[1:31:53] hallelujah praise God Amen so when you
[1:31:56] go to church accept a Creed former
[1:31:58] baptism offering you are supposed to lay
[1:32:01] there watch until you reckon Yourself
[1:32:03] Dead far from above the altar isn't that
[1:32:05] right I'm closing now watch in very
[1:32:08] plain language now according to Romans
[1:32:11] 4:16 watch the Bible talk about
[1:32:13] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:32:15] singular with Jesus and counted to seed
[1:32:18] children as children of promise and
[1:32:20] promise have to do with elect ction the
[1:32:22] choosing of God that is exactly what we
[1:32:24] have been saying these who are the Royal
[1:32:27] seeds are the elect of God are the
[1:32:29] predestinated for known of God in the
[1:32:31] mind of God and His Thoughts in very
[1:32:33] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:32:37] was in the mind of God
[1:32:39] eternally do not express until each came
[1:32:43] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:32:46] as each member came forth it become
[1:32:48] Express and took its place in the body
[1:32:52] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:32:55] word seed bride and she is feminine in
[1:32:58] designation she is called the body of
[1:33:00] Christ and he is the head Oh Glory to
[1:33:03] God it is very apparent that she ought
[1:33:06] to be called that for she was
[1:33:08] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:33:10] Source was eternal with him and now
[1:33:13] manifested God in a many membered body
[1:33:16] whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:33:18] member even our lord Jesus christu we
[1:33:21] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:33:24] were seed therefore were reborn because
[1:33:27] only the elect can be reborn so when
[1:33:30] Jesus said you must be born again he was
[1:33:33] talking to
[1:33:35] elect oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:33:38] people oh
[1:33:40] Hallelujah
[1:33:42] Glory now watch brother B talking about
[1:33:45] Samson here is my only hope this morning
[1:33:48] to wind my message up while Samson was
[1:33:51] bong and you Sher here grow out oh let
[1:33:54] them laugh at us let them laugh at what
[1:33:56] happened in the church let them laugh
[1:33:58] what happened to people and so on but
[1:33:59] while Samson was b a new shocker here
[1:34:02] grow out he said God send us another
[1:34:04] church in the end time that the power of
[1:34:07] the Holy Ghost can come into her in the
[1:34:09] demonstration of the spirit Acts 2 acts
[1:34:11] 238 would follow signs wonders accompany
[1:34:14] the apostles he said while we in prison
[1:34:17] surely God is going to crop somewhere
[1:34:20] for that last great k
[1:34:22] yes may it be you my Christian friends
[1:34:25] that your strength is beginning to come
[1:34:26] back so the seventh Thunder Revival is
[1:34:29] to bring a deliverance from every spirit
[1:34:31] that will keep the principles of the
[1:34:33] kingdom of God from flowing through you
[1:34:35] that will stop God's righteousness from
[1:34:37] flowing through you the seven Thunder
[1:34:39] Revival is the last great kill to kill
[1:34:41] the lion demons the lust demons all the
[1:34:43] demons the seven Thunders is the last
[1:34:45] great kill he said May the Samson of God
[1:34:48] May the true in heart those who are
[1:34:50] longing and crying and pleading and
[1:34:52] holding on May they stay with it Lord
[1:34:54] until this new crop grows out until they
[1:34:57] come forth a joy in Zion and they come
[1:34:59] for a group that can recognize and
[1:35:02] understand and can see the Messiah and
[1:35:04] the hidden powers that hit from the
[1:35:06] world that they will understand it now

[1:35:11] People oh
[1:35:13] Hallelujah glory and when that light
[1:35:16] struck little Rebecca Hallelujah they
