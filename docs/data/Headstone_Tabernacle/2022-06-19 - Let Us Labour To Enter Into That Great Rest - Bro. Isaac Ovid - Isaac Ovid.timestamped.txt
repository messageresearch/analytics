[37:44] and lord this song is so appropriate
[37:48] lord that we pray we'll all be ready
[37:51] lord god may you touch your people on
[37:53] this
[37:55] special sunday morning
[37:58] lord that you predestinated before the
[38:00] foundation of the world to
[38:02] unfold something to your people
[38:04] may you take me out of the way and may
[38:06] you
[38:07] speak lip to ear to your children
[38:10] may you use me as a microphone
[38:13] that you could speak directly what you
[38:15] want them to hear this morning
[38:17] father in a special way we want to pray
[38:19] for the fathers that are here in the
[38:22] tabernacle those that are connected on
[38:23] the internet on this
[38:25] father's day that the great father lord
[38:28] would inspire them to be better fathers
[38:30] to be better men to be better sons
[38:32] may you bless the church this morning
[38:34] will you bless the reading of the word
[38:36] and the opening of our understanding to
[38:38] your scriptures we turn this service
[38:41] over to you in the precious name of
[38:43] jesus christ
[38:44] and the church says amen amen amen amen
[38:48] amen
[38:49] so i greet you this morning in the
[38:51] precious name of jesus christ and just
[38:53] to get straight to the word
[38:55] i'd like to read
[38:57] uh four portions of scripture genesis 1
[39:01] genesis 2
[39:03] matthew 11
[39:05] and hebrews 4.
[39:14] looking for a wonderful time in the lord
[39:17] this morning there's no better place to
[39:20] be than in the house of the lord
[39:22] on a sunday morning is that how you feel
[39:25] wonderful so genesis 1 and reading from
[39:28] verse 26
[39:30] and god said let us make man in our
[39:33] image
[39:34] after our likeness
[39:36] and let them have dominion over the fish
[39:39] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[39:41] and over the cattle and over all the
[39:43] earth and over every creeping thing that
[39:45] creepeth upon the earth
[39:47] so god created man in his own image in
[39:51] the image of god created he him
[39:53] male and female created he them and god
[39:56] blessed them and god said unto them be
[40:00] fruitful and multiply
[40:02] now i want us to recognize that this
[40:04] conversation between god and man in
[40:06] genesis 1 is god speaking to spirit man
[40:10] this is not man with flesh because that
[40:12] man can be found in genesis 2. so god is
[40:15] having a conversation with the spirit
[40:17] man
[40:19] and he's telling the spirit man that you
[40:21] are blessed because the bible said god
[40:22] bless them and god said unto them be
[40:25] fruitful so that spirit man was supposed
[40:28] to be fruitful and multiply and
[40:30] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[40:32] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[40:34] that instruction came without even the
[40:37] flesh being around
[40:39] so we're not here to speak to the flesh
[40:41] man this morning we are speaking to the
[40:43] spirit man
[40:45] hallelujah made in the image and
[40:47] likeness of god and that man was to have
[40:49] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[40:51] over the fowl of the air and over every
[40:53] living thing that move it upon the earth
[40:56] and god said behold i give have given
[40:58] you every herb bearing seed which is
[41:00] upon the face of all the earth and every
[41:02] tree and which is the fruit of a tree
[41:04] yielding seed to you it shall be for
[41:06] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[41:09] every fowl of the air and everything
[41:11] that creepeth upon the earth wherein
[41:13] there is life i have given every green
[41:16] herb for meat and it was so
[41:18] and god saw everything that he had made
[41:20] and behold it was very good and the
[41:22] evening and the morning were the sixth
[41:24] day
[41:25] continuing into into chapter two
[41:28] genesis 2 thus the heavens and the earth
[41:30] were finished
[41:31] and all the hosts of them and on the
[41:33] seventh day god ended his work which he
[41:36] had made
[41:38] and he rested on the seventh day from
[41:40] all his work which he had made and god
[41:44] blessed the seventh day and sanctified
[41:46] it because that in it he had rested from
[41:49] all his work which god created and made
[41:53] let's go to matthew 11
[41:55] and reading from verse 28
[41:57] matthew 11 verse 28
[42:00] come unto me all ye that labor
[42:03] and are heavy laden and i will give you
[42:05] rest
[42:07] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[42:10] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[42:12] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[42:16] yoke is easy and my burden is light and
[42:19] our last scripture reading hebrews 4 and
[42:21] verse 11
[42:22] let us labor therefore to enter into
[42:25] that rest
[42:27] lest any man fall after the same example
[42:31] of unbelief may the lord have a blessing
[42:34] to the reading of his word you may be
[42:35] seated in the presence of the lord this
[42:37] morning
[42:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[42:42] oh it is good to be here this morning
[42:45] i do have a title this morning let us
[42:48] and let us labor to enter into that
[42:51] great rest
[42:52] let us labor to enter into that
[42:56] great rest and so i want to greet the
[42:59] church i want to wish a happy father's
[43:01] day
[43:02] to all of the fathers
[43:05] about here near
[43:07] far and wide it's such a blessed
[43:09] privilege to
[43:11] find fathers at such a time as this not
[43:14] men who have children but fathers
[43:17] there's a difference between having a
[43:18] child
[43:19] and being a father
[43:21] a father speaks of a certain level of
[43:23] responsibility a certain kind of an
[43:25] understanding a certain kind of
[43:27] leadership a certain kind of
[43:30] behavior and an attribute and we know
[43:32] that when we look at history
[43:35] and we look at the word and we look at
[43:36] how
[43:37] eternity and time were connected the
[43:40] fact that god existed by himself and
[43:42] there were certain attributes that he
[43:44] wanted to express
[43:46] and when he existed alone he could not
[43:47] have expressed these attributes and we
[43:51] read there in genesis genesis 1 genesis
[43:53] 2 and genesis 3
[43:55] as you go then genesis chapter 1 and see
[43:58] the first day and the second day and the
[43:59] third day when god created the animals
[44:02] and he separated the the firmament and
[44:04] all these things he could not have
[44:06] expressed his attribute of being a
[44:08] father until a son was there
[44:11] can the church say amen only when a son
[44:14] was there he could claim being a father
[44:17] and we know that when we look at the
[44:18] attributes of god only when somebody is
[44:20] sick he could claim to be a healer only
[44:22] when somebody needs a breakthrough he
[44:24] could be a deliverer only when somebody
[44:26] needs a to be pulled out of a hole he
[44:28] could be that mighty hand that pulls you
[44:31] out can the church say man
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:35] so we want to speak a little bit and
[44:36] it's so interesting today's father's day
[44:38] it's also labor day
[44:40] and because of labor day we have a
[44:42] holiday tomorrow
[44:44] so it's interesting that because of
[44:46] a day that speaks the labor we get
[44:49] to rest tomorrow
[44:53] so i was looking at these words about
[44:55] labor and rest
[44:56] and the connection between labor
[44:59] and rest and
[45:01] labor and work
[45:02] and reward
[45:04] and rest a lot of people who like reward
[45:06] without labor
[45:08] a lot of people who like results and
[45:10] they like the blessings but they don't
[45:11] want to put in the work
[45:13] they don't want to put in the effort
[45:15] they like to put in the rest but they
[45:16] don't want to put in what is required
[45:19] for rest
[45:20] and this word rest is an interesting
[45:22] word and we're going to look at it
[45:24] because there's rest and then there's
[45:25] his rest there's rest and there's god's
[45:28] rest can the church say amen
[45:29] and we live in a time when we have a lot
[45:32] of restlessness
[45:34] people are restless
[45:36] and i want us to firstly separate the
[45:38] word rest from sleep because it's two
[45:40] different words
[45:42] there are people who sleep and they
[45:43] don't get rest
[45:46] because rest does not mean sleep we
[45:48] sometimes mix up these words and we put
[45:50] it together and we use them easily and
[45:52] patch them together but there's a
[45:54] difference between sleep
[45:56] and rest
[45:57] the word rest is a word that speaks to
[46:00] peace
[46:01] when you're at rest there's no movement
[46:04] when you're at rest you are unbothered
[46:07] when you are at rest you're not you're
[46:09] not concerned about certain things
[46:11] i want to remind us that we live in a
[46:13] world where people struggle to sleep
[46:16] and because they can't sleep they get no
[46:18] rest
[46:21] charles spurgeon a great preacher many
[46:23] years ago he said rest a dainty word
[46:25] indeed
[46:26] too rich a syllable
[46:28] because it's one syllable for this
[46:30] unstable it
[46:32] it is not a stray word he said rest is
[46:35] it obtainable is it possible
[46:38] can there ever be rest for a race who
[46:40] were driven out of paradise
[46:42] rest is it possible for a soul polluted
[46:45] with sin tossed to and fro with inward
[46:47] lust
[46:49] because rest again is not sleep it means
[46:51] peace with god
[46:54] rest means freedom from a servile
[46:56] bondage world free to worship
[47:00] free to praise
[47:03] there are people who don't understand
[47:04] this rest that we're speaking about
[47:06] because rest means deliverance
[47:09] rest means freedom
[47:11] and it's interesting to separate that
[47:14] sleep from rest because when we look
[47:16] there in the garden of eden are you with
[47:18] me this morning i'm laying a foundation
[47:20] because we want to go somewhere the
[47:22] bible said that god on the first day he
[47:24] created on the second day he created on
[47:26] the third day we know this and i read
[47:28] specifically on the sixth day and god
[47:30] said let us make man
[47:33] in our image and in our likeness
[47:35] on this particular day day six there was
[47:37] a certain level of care that had to be
[47:39] exercised because it wasn't making an
[47:41] animal god had to look at himself and
[47:44] fashion he had to look at himself and
[47:46] put it together because he said let us
[47:48] make man in our image and our
[47:50] likeness he couldn't just see that's an
[47:53] animal there and that's an animal there
[47:54] this was different he was taking time to
[47:57] perfect this creation because it had to
[47:59] look like him
[48:01] operate like him
[48:03] live like
[48:04] him anybody with me this morning
[48:08] and after he was finished with the
[48:10] clarence for the first time we find that
[48:12] word there in genesis
[48:15] god was able to rest
[48:19] a god that cannot sleep
[48:22] rested
[48:23] a god that cannot get tired rested
[48:27] isaiah 40 28 says hast thou not known
[48:30] hast thou not heard that the everlasting
[48:32] god the lord the creator of the ends of
[48:35] the earth fainted not neither is weary
[48:38] there is no searching for his
[48:39] understanding a god who cannot get wary
[48:42] took a rest
[48:45] what kind of rest is this that someone
[48:47] who cannot sleep can be in rest
[48:50] can be in peace
[48:52] can be unmoved by what's going on
[48:54] because everything is in order can the
[48:57] church say man we are reframing this
[49:00] morning the concept of rest
[49:05] for god rest was not a necessity it was
[49:09] a choice
[49:10] rest was a decision
[49:13] rest was a reward
[49:15] at the end of the successful completion
[49:18] of a specific set of actions he didn't
[49:21] rest after the first day he didn't rest
[49:23] after the second day he didn't rest
[49:25] after the third day he didn't rest after
[49:27] the fourth day he didn't rest after the
[49:30] fifth day but it was after the sixth day
[49:32] was finished
[49:34] when the mission for which he was
[49:36] building was accomplished
[49:38] rest was now possible
[49:40] because everything was in order
[49:42] rest was possible because nothing else
[49:44] was required
[49:46] hallelujah god was able to rest
[49:49] because a father
[49:51] had produced a son
[49:53] anybody with me this morning
[49:56] on this father's day god was able to
[49:58] rest because the father could see
[50:00] there's my son
[50:02] a son just like him
[50:05] produced
[50:06] the rest of god
[50:08] a son in his image produced the rest of
[50:12] god
[50:14] can the church say amen
[50:16] day one day two day three day four day
[50:18] five of creation they were physical
[50:21] corporal manifestation that were visible
[50:23] these manifestations could not produce
[50:26] the rest of god
[50:28] but a son in his image and his likeness
[50:31] produced the rest of god because rest
[50:34] represented the finishing of a work
[50:37] rest represented a reward god could rest
[50:40] because a son is in position i wonder
[50:43] what would happen when more sons come
[50:45] into position i wonder what will happen
[50:48] when sons take their place
[50:51] one more time because god knows that
[50:53] there are workers
[50:55] who could handle the work the work in
[50:57] the first day and the second day he had
[50:59] to do it but when man was there god said
[51:01] i could rest now or because my son
[51:04] can continue to work
[51:06] and the church say man i could take a
[51:08] rest now
[51:10] because i have empowered somebody i said
[51:12] to that son you're gonna have dominion
[51:14] over the fish over the trees over your
[51:17] circumstances over your situation and
[51:20] because i've given you that power and
[51:21] because you are in order and because
[51:23] everything is in place i could rest
[51:26] because this jurisdiction belongs to my
[51:28] son
[51:29] and as a proud father i could rest when
[51:32] my son is in position oh how god loves
[51:35] to rest when he sees his sons in
[51:37] position
[51:42] [Applause]
[51:43] and adam lived in the rest of god
[51:47] the safety of god the peace of god the
[51:51] comfort of god a rest there was no worry
[51:55] there was no stress
[51:57] he was in the rest of god when you are
[51:59] in that rest and remember the letters
[52:02] labor to enter into that great rest
[52:05] because when you're in that rest you
[52:06] don't have no sorrows you don't have no
[52:08] stresses you have things to do but
[52:10] you're at rest your soul is at rest your
[52:14] mind is at rest your money and your bank
[52:17] account in trouble but you are at rest
[52:21] oh to find that rest this morning is
[52:24] there anybody looking for rest
[52:27] tired sleeping but you don't have rest
[52:29] this morning there's a rest he said come
[52:31] unto me all the labor and are heavy
[52:34] laden and i will give you rest
[52:37] rest from your trouble rest from your
[52:39] ups and down rest from your worries and
[52:42] the cares of the world come unto me all
[52:45] everybody everybody who laboring heavy
[52:48] laden have all kind of burdens and i
[52:50] will give you rest
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:56] adam walked in the garden living
[52:59] in the rest of god
[53:02] rest doesn't mean you're not working you
[53:03] know it just means the state of your
[53:05] working
[53:08] adam worked in the garden
[53:11] living
[53:12] in the rest of god
[53:14] i want us to add to this the devil was
[53:17] in the garden but he was powerless
[53:19] because adam was at rest
[53:21] the devil walking around but he's
[53:23] powerless because adam is at rest god
[53:26] put me into that rest where the devil
[53:28] can't move nothing could move you i
[53:31] might rest
[53:32] nothing could shake my feet nothing
[53:35] could shake my work nothing could shake
[53:37] my talk i'm at rest i'm at perfect peace
[53:40] i'm at peace in my heart
[53:42] peace in my soul the storm might be
[53:44] raging the devil could be walking around
[53:47] but i might rest up nothing can move me
[53:50] my ankle is holding in spite of the
[53:52] storm because i'm at rest
[53:57] and that's how adam was
[53:59] walking the garden he was naming the
[54:01] animals the devil is mad he's watching
[54:03] but he can do nothing because adam is at
[54:06] rest he's living in the rest of god
[54:10] lord take me into that rest but come
[54:12] this morning all ye who are laboring and
[54:15] heavy laden and i can give you that same
[54:18] rest that rest that adam had he was born
[54:21] into that rest and you have to be born
[54:25] into this rest
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:29] [Music]
[54:42] when you're at rest there's no worry in
[54:44] the world that what the government is
[54:46] doing don't bother you because you're at
[54:48] rest what the doctor says
[54:50] can't move you because you are the rest
[54:53] god give me the rest to raise above the
[54:56] doctor's report
[54:57] give me rest to raise up of my work
[55:00] situation give me rest
[55:03] to
[55:04] live above my family situation
[55:07] the rest
[55:09] of god
[55:14] [Applause]
[55:23] rest
[55:26] when an object is at rest there's no
[55:29] no movement
[55:32] the wind could blow but it's at rest
[55:35] the storm could come but it's at rest
[55:38] i think back to when jesus was on the
[55:40] earth
[55:41] and he was so tired he rested on the
[55:43] boat
[55:44] oh god he was resting
[55:46] but his rest was interrupted by a storm
[55:49] that came
[55:50] and i loved the context of this
[55:52] statement because jesus by the eclipse
[55:54] could have spoken to the storm
[55:56] but he did not dress the storm he said
[55:58] peace
[55:59] come back to rest
[56:01] peace be still
[56:03] because if you have peace in your heart
[56:04] and that peace is a stillness it's a
[56:07] rest it's a place it don't matter what
[56:09] the storm is doing when peace is in
[56:10] order the storms could swirl but there's
[56:12] a stillness in your heart because you're
[56:15] in the rest of god
[56:19] i'm not talking about resting in the
[56:20] safety of your job
[56:22] resting in the safety of your work or
[56:24] your church or the safety of the pastor
[56:26] we're talking about the rest of god come
[56:29] holy you
[56:30] labor
[56:32] and i have you laden
[56:34] i
[56:35] will give you
[56:37] rest
[56:40] this kind of rest is you meet some
[56:42] people who say they're tired and it's
[56:44] not and it's not that they're sleepy
[56:50] they just really want rest
[56:53] they slept eight hours and i wake up in
[56:54] the morning
[56:56] still feeling tired it is not a physical
[56:59] tiredness they're talking about it's a
[57:01] tiredness of soul that only could be
[57:04] cured or remedied or the prescription
[57:08] that is really needed is the rest of god
[57:12] [Applause]
[57:13] because five minutes in his presence
[57:15] will give you more rest than eight hours
[57:17] of sleep at night
[57:19] or you don't hear me this morning
[57:21] or you don't hear me this morning
[57:23] five minutes in his presence is worth
[57:26] more than eight hours of us sleep
[57:27] medicine because he is our rest
[57:31] oh god i want to find that rest
[57:34] i've been laboring i'm heavy laden but i
[57:36] need to get some
[57:39] rest
[57:43] choices
[57:44] decisions
[57:46] situations
[57:48] issues
[57:49] conflict
[57:50] turmoil they all wear me down i slept
[57:54] but i'm tired
[57:55] i sleep but i still at night
[57:58] i trying to sleep but i can't find rest
[58:00] but this morning lord take me to a place
[58:04] where i could find
[58:06] rest
[58:11] when adam fell in sin
[58:14] he fell from the
[58:16] rest of god
[58:20] bear in mind he was working in the
[58:22] garden but he was in the rest of god
[58:26] it was because of the fall by the
[58:28] anthony that god said to adam now you're
[58:31] going to move from work to labor
[58:34] and by the sweat of your brow
[58:41] because work and worship is the same
[58:43] word
[58:44] the root word of work and worship is the
[58:46] same but it's the difficulty of work and
[58:47] labor
[58:50] work is purpose
[58:53] adam was commanded to be fruitful
[58:56] multiply subdue replenish these were his
[59:00] work that was his work
[59:03] when you find your work
[59:04] your purpose your calling you're at
[59:06] peace you're at rest
[59:08] but you see labor
[59:11] and and not only was adam told by your
[59:13] sweat it's what you will eat but now eve
[59:16] was told that listen in childbirth
[59:19] i'm now going to introduce labor
[59:24] labor did not exist before the fall only
[59:26] worked it
[59:32] so because adam fell from the rest of
[59:34] god work became
[59:36] labor
[59:40] what was purpose
[59:42] divine and destined and purpose-driven
[59:46] adam was working in the garden he had
[59:48] power to do certain things it was never
[59:51] something that got him tired
[59:53] it wasn't something that got him sick
[59:55] it was something wary he was just like
[59:57] god who could not get wary but all of a
[1:00:00] sudden the fall brought labor
[1:00:03] pain
[1:00:05] sweat
[1:00:06] turmoil
[1:00:08] effort
[1:00:10] struggle
[1:00:11] a fight
[1:00:13] and we were removed from that state of
[1:00:15] spiritual work which was a combination
[1:00:18] of worship and work that was directed by
[1:00:21] a job description that god provided oh
[1:00:24] you don't hear me
[1:00:27] are you with me anybody with me
[1:00:29] you realize that adam was given a job
[1:00:31] description
[1:00:32] to worship
[1:00:34] the fellowship to subdue to replenish to
[1:00:38] have dominion that was a job description
[1:00:41] his job description wasn't paying pills
[1:00:43] and collecting checks and that wasn't
[1:00:45] his job description
[1:00:50] but because he fell from his place
[1:00:53] his job description was rewritten
[1:00:56] tone of labor
[1:00:57] and one of sweat
[1:00:59] and one of effort
[1:01:01] and one of turmoil and from that time
[1:01:04] till this time that labor has been in
[1:01:07] effect so that's what jesus met when he
[1:01:09] said come all ye who labor
[1:01:12] weary
[1:01:14] tired
[1:01:15] trying to make ends meet
[1:01:17] trying to do the best you could
[1:01:18] trying to struggle
[1:01:20] before i came there wasn't really a
[1:01:22] solution for this thing but now that i'm
[1:01:24] here come all you who labor because this
[1:01:27] labor started with adam but now a new
[1:01:28] adam was in the urge to address the
[1:01:30] issue of labor that was established here
[1:01:32] in genesis or you don't hear me this

[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:23] [Applause]
[1:03:30] in a message fellowship
[1:03:32] in 1956
[1:03:36] branham said here a few nights ago i
[1:03:37] woke up
[1:03:39] and i had a sermon on my heart
[1:03:42] of resting
[1:03:47] so the prophet is stirred in the middle
[1:03:49] of his night
[1:03:51] and his sleep is interrupted
[1:03:54] with a thought of rest
[1:03:58] he said i didn't have no audience
[1:04:02] so i had a one-woman audience my wife i
[1:04:04] woke her up
[1:04:07] he interrupted her sleep
[1:04:10] to tell her about rest
[1:04:13] i said honey i just got to preach to you
[1:04:15] a minute
[1:04:16] i did about three hours
[1:04:20] he said oh resting
[1:04:25] in the message the interval so this is a
[1:04:27] wrong the same period in fact this is
[1:04:29] just a few days or so around the same
[1:04:31] period of time but the brandon is going
[1:04:33] through a period looking at this thing
[1:04:35] about rest
[1:04:36] he said now that is what i find around
[1:04:38] most christian lives
[1:04:41] most i hate to say it that way but it's
[1:04:43] true
[1:04:44] most people that can profess
[1:04:45] christianity they seem to have such a
[1:04:48] hard struggle in time to hold on
[1:04:52] i believe it's because of a lack of
[1:04:54] correct teaching of the bible
[1:04:58] there's no such thing as holding on
[1:05:01] he done the holding on
[1:05:04] the whole christian principle is based
[1:05:06] upon rest
[1:05:11] and but the random quotes the scripture
[1:05:13] come unto me all you that labor and
[1:05:15] heavy lady i will give you rest
[1:05:17] where you don't have to worry and
[1:05:19] struggle
[1:05:20] you're just resting that's all given
[1:05:23] rest you enter in peace
[1:05:26] peace that the whole thing's finished
[1:05:28] peace that you're gonna make it
[1:05:30] peace that you're gonna be healed
[1:05:33] peace that he is jehovah jireh peace
[1:05:36] that he is your provider peace that all
[1:05:39] things will work together for good to
[1:05:41] them that love god and them do what they
[1:05:43] call according to his purpose peace that
[1:05:46] he is still a healer peace that he will
[1:05:48] open doors that you can figure out how
[1:05:50] to open you are resting on that
[1:05:54] you are resting on that piece that he is
[1:05:57] the prince of peace you are resting on
[1:06:00] the promises of god and the devil can
[1:06:02] move you you are at rest
[1:06:06] the devil brings a mind battle but you
[1:06:08] at rest i hope this stabilizes the
[1:06:10] rudders of your ship this morning

[1:06:21] children

[1:06:46] backing you up against a wall
[1:06:48] curing you in a better sickness

[1:06:54] driving you to a church service he
[1:06:55] didn't want to go to
[1:06:58] anybody with me this morning
[1:07:00] if you could only get to that place of
[1:07:02] rest
[1:07:03] to know that the promise is unto you and
[1:07:06] to your children you can't make the
[1:07:08] promise of them but god already made a
[1:07:09] promise to your children i pray you
[1:07:12] could rest on that tonight

[1:07:18] children will be restored

[1:07:22] want to rest with me on the promise
[1:07:25] that your family has got to be delivered
[1:07:28] and it will not be you doing the
[1:07:29] delivering but you could rest confident
[1:07:32] on the fact that the one who wrote the
[1:07:34] word is still more than able to bring
[1:07:37] the word to pass can you rest on the
[1:07:39] promise that though the skin worms
[1:07:41] destroyed his body yet in my flesh
[1:07:45] you're gonna see god i'm resting on that
[1:07:48] this morning
[1:07:56] friends it's not easy to trust you know
[1:08:00] it's not easy to trust
[1:08:03] it takes a lot of restraint
[1:08:06] when you want to get involved in
[1:08:08] something
[1:08:09] to try to fix it
[1:08:11] but i want you to take this note this
[1:08:13] morning
[1:08:14] you can fix
[1:08:16] anything
[1:08:18] the fixer is god
[1:08:20] and if you could just rest on that
[1:08:23] and put trust in that and put confidence
[1:08:26] in that and you could just
[1:08:28] you heard what i read the whole
[1:08:30] christian principle is based upon rest
[1:08:34] by rest i don't mean you're not praying
[1:08:36] or you're not know you're not
[1:08:37] worshipping them but you're at rest in
[1:08:39] god but you're worshiping

[1:08:50] your word
[1:08:51] the doctor's report is a negative report
[1:08:54] but i'm not going to study that report
[1:08:57] i'm not going to pick it up every day to
[1:08:59] reinterpret the analysis of the data i
[1:09:02] am going to trust you i'm going to put
[1:09:04] the report aside and i'm going to rest
[1:09:07] and i am the god and healed thee i'm

[1:09:18] you will direct my path there are some
[1:09:21] decisions i need to make but i want to

[1:09:26] you'll put the right words in my mouth
[1:09:28] you'll help me to break past my own
[1:09:30] limitations is there anybody in the
[1:09:32] house can we give the lord a shout out
[1:09:33] praise this morning
[1:09:38] [Applause]
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:09:56] in the message fellowship
[1:09:59] adam says the whole christian experience
[1:10:03] is based solemnly
[1:10:06] and holy
[1:10:08] upon rest
[1:10:11] he said we are tossed about with
[1:10:12] everything until you come to christ
[1:10:15] then it's all finished
[1:10:17] resting in christ perfectly
[1:10:22] friends
[1:10:24] i was saying to my wife
[1:10:26] i say getting all this something else
[1:10:31] i see brother clarence laughing
[1:10:34] clarence say what brother is that
[1:10:35] talking about this young
[1:10:42] boy but getting all makes you reflect
[1:10:46] and think
[1:10:47] who is certainly not how he was when he
[1:10:49] was 15 or 25 or 25 and
[1:10:53] as you get older you started
[1:10:56] because a real question
[1:10:59] am i ready
[1:11:05] if the lord were to call me home this
[1:11:07] evening
[1:11:10] am i ready
[1:11:15] what are you resting on
[1:11:18] that could allow you to sit back on a
[1:11:20] chair
[1:11:21] and say i'm resting on this solid place
[1:11:30] i've met people who said i'm i'm ready
[1:11:32] to go
[1:11:34] not because they want to leave here to
[1:11:35] know but their soul is at rest
[1:11:42] soul is at rest
[1:11:44] trust me the sleep you get at night when
[1:11:46] your soul is at rest is a different kind
[1:11:48] of sleep
[1:11:54] when your soul
[1:11:57] is at rest
[1:11:58] not your mind at rest people's mind
[1:12:01] racing
[1:12:02] but when your soul is at rest
[1:12:06] it's a comfort
[1:12:09] you begin to look through people
[1:12:13] you begin to re-evaluate relationships
[1:12:15] and conversations and situations and
[1:12:18] challenges
[1:12:19] because everybody going through
[1:12:20] something
[1:12:22] but it's a difference when you're going
[1:12:24] through something and your soul
[1:12:27] is at rest
[1:12:30] trials will always be there
[1:12:33] situations will always be there but god
[1:12:36] let my soul
[1:12:38] be
[1:12:40] addressed
[1:12:44] i'm back to the court but i'm saying
[1:12:46] resting in christ perfectly no matter
[1:12:48] what comes or goes that's a place to be
[1:12:51] friends
[1:12:52] you're not tired of one day you're up
[1:12:54] one day you're doing it you're just
[1:12:56] agitated you struggle you you press your
[1:12:58] way you'll fight you here one month
[1:13:00] you're good next minute you just dare
[1:13:01] you go through a boat a depression go
[1:13:04] through all kind of agony and you're
[1:13:05] like oh god can i just find some
[1:13:07] stability in you
[1:13:10] that no matter what comes the children
[1:13:12] come and say something you job was
[1:13:14] obviously at rest
[1:13:18] because no matter what it brought to him
[1:13:20] he wasn't moved
[1:13:23] through his whole trial
[1:13:27] people talking to him and somehow you
[1:13:28] couldn't get job to bend
[1:13:33] even when his wife come and say why you
[1:13:35] don't curse god and die he's he said you
[1:13:38] speak like a foolish woman
[1:13:40] then his ash he be even break because
[1:13:43] there was a rest
[1:13:45] in his soul
[1:13:48] i want to be like that
[1:13:50] is there anybody here wants to be like
[1:13:51] that
[1:13:53] you get bad news from your business here
[1:13:56] the band give you a piece of news and
[1:13:58] listen
[1:13:59] listen i've been through days where news
[1:14:02] knock you off your feet it take hours to
[1:14:03] recovery
[1:14:08] sometimes a phone ring and you hang up
[1:14:10] and your wife say isaac what happened
[1:14:12] don't worry about it see i know
[1:14:14] something happened what is it
[1:14:16] because your whole continents change
[1:14:18] your whole mood change
[1:14:20] you was eating food and all of a sudden
[1:14:21] you lost your appetite
[1:14:23] the food was a singer
[1:14:26] but that piece of news yes your whole
[1:14:28] appetite
[1:14:29] you're looking at the food but the tea
[1:14:31] is gone
[1:14:34] you have no tears
[1:14:37] two minutes ago it was good enough
[1:14:39] but a piece of news come and interrupt
[1:14:41] your life
[1:14:45] but if your soul is at rest and as you
[1:14:47] saw it
[1:14:49] you could you could keep eating
[1:14:53] the food keep the taste
[1:14:56] and your confidence is like water and
[1:14:58] duck back
[1:15:00] oh you could hear that in your you're
[1:15:02] still focused because i'm at rest
[1:15:04] if this happened this way it's because
[1:15:06] god allow it to happen this way
[1:15:09] if this interruption if this thing went
[1:15:11] wrong if this happened this way
[1:15:14] it's either we trust in god or we are
[1:15:16] trusting god but if we trust god and all
[1:15:18] things work together for good and we are
[1:15:20] resting on that
[1:15:23] then how things could throw you off
[1:15:26] friends are preaching to myself you know
[1:15:27] i'm preaching to all of us
[1:15:36] you go through some stuff and you see
[1:15:37] how you have to
[1:15:39] grow up
[1:15:40] at a time when branham went through his
[1:15:42] trials he wasn't seeing it for what it
[1:15:44] was it was when he when he was stable
[1:15:46] more stable and god beat him out and say
[1:15:48] listen you have to be more sincere he
[1:15:50] could look back and say he was just
[1:15:51] testing me
[1:15:53] but those tests and those experiences to
[1:15:55] sharpen and hone his character
[1:15:58] so he can handle the situations of life
[1:16:00] i trust this is helping somebody this
[1:16:02] morning
[1:16:04] no matter what comes or goes nothing can
[1:16:06] touch us with out it comes over the
[1:16:09] shepherd let's hold it but abandon this
[1:16:10] positioning he has to permit it
[1:16:13] the bible says all things work together
[1:16:15] for good to them that love god
[1:16:18] you have to remind yourself of that to
[1:16:19] know when things go wrong whenever
[1:16:21] things go wrong say all things work
[1:16:23] together for good
[1:16:24] i'm not seeing it right now lord you
[1:16:26] know i'm not seeing it but i trust him
[1:16:28] because you said all things were
[1:16:29] together
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:34] whatever the situation is
[1:16:36] that is resting on it
[1:16:39] and friends it's not going to be easy to
[1:16:40] do it you know but if you practice it
[1:16:43] and practice it and every day you drill
[1:16:45] it all things work together for good
[1:16:48] nothing can happen at god or allah
[1:16:50] it's either go to control or you're not
[1:16:52] in control if he in control then nothing
[1:16:53] could come to your house or your door to
[1:16:55] your situation that god didn't allow to
[1:16:57] come for your perfection for your
[1:16:59] benefit for your maturity
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:07] no matter how unpleasant it is because
[1:17:08] if every experience we have is pleasant
[1:17:10] you're not going to grow from it
[1:17:12] it is true unpleasantness we grow that's
[1:17:16] what forces us is out of our comfort
[1:17:18] zone that chicken has to break out of
[1:17:20] its comfort zone to break out the shell
[1:17:23] and if you don't break out the shell it
[1:17:24] will die
[1:17:26] but it is uncomfortable
[1:17:28] so god will make things uncomfortable
[1:17:31] for us
[1:17:32] for us to re-evaluate and go back to
[1:17:34] basics for us to go back to the genesis
[1:17:37] to go back to the foundation take it
[1:17:38] back to abc's after all yeah leave all
[1:17:40] the mysteries and stuff in a recognition
[1:17:42] i know all these missions but this
[1:17:43] depression thing and this frustration
[1:17:45] thing and this temper and this anger and
[1:17:47] this envy and this lust and it's
[1:17:49] whatever it is god wants to take that
[1:17:50] out of you take the lord on me can the
[1:17:52] church say amen
[1:17:55] and that friends is our labor
[1:17:59] because we are laboring through these
[1:18:01] trials truly said to enter into his rest
[1:18:04] because that is not what paul brings out
[1:18:07] in the book of hebrews
[1:18:09] can the church say amen
[1:18:12] you maybe see this there's a few more
[1:18:14] things to encourage us
[1:18:17] i just want to finish this quote he has
[1:18:19] to permit it the bible said all things
[1:18:21] work together for good to do not love
[1:18:22] god has to come over shepherd first said
[1:18:25] i am the door
[1:18:27] no man can come in without me
[1:18:29] you see how powerful that is
[1:18:31] let me tell you when god permits
[1:18:33] anything i'm reading it's working to
[1:18:35] your good
[1:18:40] so just to nail down this thing about
[1:18:42] rest and it's not sleep on these things
[1:18:45] we know the story of root i want to do a
[1:18:46] bible study in it soon
[1:18:48] but ruth chapter 3 verse 1 then naomi
[1:18:51] her mother-in-law said unto her my
[1:18:53] daughter
[1:18:54] shall i not seek rest for thee
[1:18:58] that it may be well with thee
[1:19:02] what rest was naomi looking for
[1:19:05] it wasn't sleep she was trying to get
[1:19:07] rude to sleep
[1:19:09] she wanted the rest or the peace shall i
[1:19:11] not seek peace for thee rest for the
[1:19:13] comfort safety for thee that it may be
[1:19:16] well with thee
[1:19:21] in a message fate but i said i was
[1:19:23] preaching to her but about him a couple
[1:19:25] times this thing about rest for quite
[1:19:27] some time he keep talking about i wake
[1:19:28] up my wife to tell her what is resting
[1:19:32] and he said i was preaching to her on
[1:19:34] the christian's rest when you've come to
[1:19:36] christ everything's settled
[1:19:38] come unto me all you that labor and i
[1:19:40] heavily now give you rest it's settled
[1:19:41] it's all over christ has done paid the
[1:19:43] price
[1:19:45] everything you have to do is just rest
[1:19:48] let down quit jumping around getting all
[1:19:51] this to place the police and
[1:19:52] denominations packing a letter from the
[1:19:54] methodist city baptist
[1:19:57] that's john barron from doctrine young
[1:19:58] church church you think one minute you
[1:20:00] think
[1:20:01] put it in heaven once and leave it there
[1:20:04] don't be so let god just come to my rest
[1:20:07] if he's jehovah jireh rest on it if he's
[1:20:09] jehovah rapha rest on it if he's the law
[1:20:12] that saves us by grace rest on it if
[1:20:14] he's the lord who heals us by grace rest
[1:20:16] on it if he's a god that's coming from
[1:20:18] heaven with ten thousand of his sins
[1:20:20] rest on it if the dead in christ shall
[1:20:22] rise first rest on it everything rest oh
[1:20:25] my he said i feel pretty religious right
[1:20:28] now or resting not jumping about from
[1:20:30] pillar to post and carried about with
[1:20:32] every wind of doctrine but resting on
[1:20:35] what god said
[1:20:37] every promise in the book is yours i'm
[1:20:38] going on every amen and year is yours
[1:20:42] what you've got to be worried about may
[1:20:44] after this disservice you have no
[1:20:46] worries anymore even all age
[1:20:49] it shouldn't have a thing to do with it
[1:20:52] so but i say don't even worry about all
[1:20:54] age sickness has nothing to do with it
[1:20:56] god promised and god has to keep his
[1:20:59] promise
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:02] oh
[1:21:03] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:07] oh my my man
[1:21:10] come unto me matthew 11 we read the
[1:21:12] scripture come unto me all ye that labor
[1:21:17] and are heavy laden
[1:21:19] you have a burden and i will give you
[1:21:20] rest
[1:21:22] and jesus goes on in verse 29 take my
[1:21:24] yoke upon you
[1:21:26] and learn of me
[1:21:29] that's why we come to service that's why
[1:21:31] we have bible study that's why we fellas
[1:21:32] are going to learn of me for i am meek
[1:21:35] and lowly in heart
[1:21:37] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[1:21:41] for my yoke is easy
[1:21:43] my burden is light
[1:21:46] i want to go through hebrews 4. you
[1:21:47] could get it on on scripture
[1:21:51] we read
[1:21:52] the end part pretty much of it but i
[1:21:54] want to kind of build just some context
[1:21:56] out of this hebrews 4 if you would work
[1:21:58] with me here
[1:22:00] from verse 1.
[1:22:04] and bear in mind this is paul writing
[1:22:07] maybe brother nicholas you could get it
[1:22:09] up on the screen
[1:22:10] this is paul right and it's not a letter
[1:22:12] to the colossians or to the galatians or
[1:22:15] to the romans this is a letter to the
[1:22:17] hebrews so he's speaking to people who
[1:22:19] understand the law
[1:22:21] he's speaking to people who know history
[1:22:23] he's speaking the people who would have
[1:22:24] studied the books
[1:22:25] anybody with me this morning he said let
[1:22:28] us there for fear
[1:22:31] so he's bringing a solemnness in this
[1:22:34] letter here
[1:22:35] lest a promise being left us
[1:22:38] of entering
[1:22:40] into his rest
[1:22:42] any of you
[1:22:44] should come short of it
[1:22:47] so paul let me just fix this here
[1:22:49] quickly
[1:22:53] let us therefore feel as a promise being
[1:22:55] left us of entering into address any of
[1:22:57] you
[1:22:58] should seem to come short of it
[1:23:03] that's a serious scripture
[1:23:06] in other words he said there's a
[1:23:07] seriousness to this thing
[1:23:11] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:23:13] well as unto them
[1:23:15] so you see the preaching of the gospel
[1:23:17] that came to us was also preaching was
[1:23:20] done to them and he's speaking about the
[1:23:22] children of israel
[1:23:24] but the word preached did not profit
[1:23:26] them
[1:23:29] not being mixed with feet
[1:23:31] in them that heard it
[1:23:34] so the gospel was preached
[1:23:36] to the children of israel and because
[1:23:38] they didn't mix it with feet
[1:23:41] because you didn't take action because
[1:23:43] they were not positive about it
[1:23:46] it had no benefit to them you see how
[1:23:48] people come to church and you would
[1:23:50] preach and there's no benefit
[1:23:51] because you're not mixing it with faith
[1:23:54] and fear comes by hearing
[1:23:58] and hearing the word of god
[1:24:01] so there's supposed to be a mixing of
[1:24:03] feet
[1:24:04] and a taking of the word by saying here
[1:24:06] and amen to the word and an action to
[1:24:08] the word of god
[1:24:10] and faith without works is dead and
[1:24:12] faith in the word means you take action
[1:24:15] by not worrying by not complaining by
[1:24:18] not because that is always how to mix it
[1:24:20] you're mixing faith with the word so
[1:24:22] you're saying for unto us was the gospel
[1:24:24] preached as well as unto them but you
[1:24:26] would preach it not profit them not
[1:24:28] being mixed with faith in them that
[1:24:30] heard it
[1:24:32] for we which have believed
[1:24:35] do enter into
[1:24:37] rest
[1:24:42] so the first step of entering into that
[1:24:44] rest starts with belief
[1:24:46] as he said as i have sworn in my wrath
[1:24:49] if they shall enter into my rest
[1:24:52] all of the works were finished from the
[1:24:54] foundation of the world for he spake and
[1:24:56] so paul is tying up all the loose ends
[1:25:00] of this thing
[1:25:01] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:25:03] seventh day on this wise this is back in
[1:25:06] genesis now and god did rest the seventh
[1:25:10] day from all his works
[1:25:13] and in this place and as brother brown
[1:25:15] said that was just a type of the rest
[1:25:17] because i said what is this but he said
[1:25:20] one when it's sunday in this part of the
[1:25:22] world is sunday somewhere else it's
[1:25:23] saturday the times when he said that
[1:25:24] which just a type of this great rest
[1:25:27] this place of rest for the believer he
[1:25:29] said if they shall enter into my rest
[1:25:31] seeing therefore in verse six it remain
[1:25:34] it that some must enter therein
[1:25:37] and they to whom it was first preached
[1:25:41] entered not in because of unbelief
[1:25:44] so he first said they didn't mix it with
[1:25:45] faith now he's saying because they
[1:25:47] didn't believe it
[1:25:49] is why they didn't enter in
[1:25:51] again he limited a certainty saying in
[1:25:54] david today after so long a time as it
[1:25:58] is said today if you will hear his voice
[1:26:00] harden not your hearts
[1:26:03] and paul is now bringing jesus into it
[1:26:05] now he said for if jesus had given them
[1:26:08] rest
[1:26:09] then would he not afterward have spoken
[1:26:11] of another day
[1:26:13] so paul is saying listen this thing is
[1:26:15] not finished yet
[1:26:17] he said now in verse 9 there remained
[1:26:20] there for arrest to the people of god
[1:26:22] there's still this resting
[1:26:26] that the people of god have to enter in
[1:26:29] jesus called him to it he introduced it
[1:26:31] he said i will give you this rest but
[1:26:33] paul is saying they remained therefore
[1:26:36] arrested the people of god
[1:26:38] for he that has entered into his rest he
[1:26:42] also had ceased from his own works
[1:26:45] as god did from his
[1:26:48] let us labor therefore so this scripture
[1:26:51] we read verse 11 was based on the
[1:26:54] background because he used the word
[1:26:56] therefore so based on the arguments that
[1:26:58] i've laid out before
[1:27:00] let us therefore let us labor therefore
[1:27:03] to enter that rest
[1:27:05] lest any man fall after the same example
[1:27:08] of unbelief
[1:27:11] so this was a warning scripture church
[1:27:13] a scripture of warning starts over
[1:27:15] saying letters there for fear he's
[1:27:17] warning the church
[1:27:19] that this labor is actually what is is a
[1:27:21] labor true unbelief you know
[1:27:24] is a labor to not be like those who went
[1:27:27] before
[1:27:28] it's a labor past your own limitations
[1:27:31] he said let us labor so we don't end up
[1:27:33] in a situation that they end up in
[1:27:35] before anybody with me
[1:27:37] and to you the way to do it is to mix
[1:27:40] this word with faith
[1:27:42] every single day you're pleading the
[1:27:43] promise you're claiming the promise
[1:27:44] you're living the promise you're shaking
[1:27:46] yourself it's a sacrifice a sacrifice of
[1:27:48] praise a sacrifice of worship it's an
[1:27:50] attitude it's you taking your thoughts
[1:27:52] and putting it under subjection
[1:27:55] can we go on a little further
[1:28:00] hebrews chapter four listen now to
[1:28:01] brother brown i'm beginning to tie it
[1:28:03] together now
[1:28:04] so if you have never received the holy
[1:28:06] ghost yet
[1:28:09] you have never entered into god's rest
[1:28:12] say it one more time if you've never
[1:28:14] received the holy ghost yet you have
[1:28:16] never entered into god's rest you don't
[1:28:19] have to say oh i wouldn't i want to
[1:28:20] smoke i just couldn't i'm a christian i
[1:28:22] really don't want to drink but i'm a
[1:28:23] christian i just can't don't want it but
[1:28:25] i like it he said if you lust after a
[1:28:27] woman if you do all these ungodly things
[1:28:30] you have never hit that rest period yet
[1:28:32] you have never entered into your rest
[1:28:35] and when you enter into this rest you
[1:28:37] cease from your own worldly works like
[1:28:40] god did from his why you're part of god
[1:28:42] you rest eternally there you are that's
[1:28:45] the sabbath come unto me all ye that
[1:28:48] labor can the church say amen
[1:28:51] so now we begin to tie it together now
[1:28:53] this rest is this holy ghost thing you
[1:28:55] know
[1:28:57] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:28:59] you believe have you received the holy
[1:29:01] ghost since any message have you
[1:29:02] received the holy ghost since you come
[1:29:04] into church have you received the holy
[1:29:05] ghost since you know all these mysteries
[1:29:07] have you seen have you seen you read all
[1:29:09] these books and these tapes is the holy
[1:29:11] ghost inside of you
[1:29:13] because a promise is still a new heart a
[1:29:15] new spirit his spirit takes you into
[1:29:18] that rest
[1:29:19] that's the rest we preaching about let
[1:29:21] us labor to enter into that great rest
[1:29:26] oh
[1:29:27] hallelujah can the church say man
[1:29:29] somebody gave god worship somebody shake
[1:29:32] us up this morning can we labor can we
[1:29:35] switch laboring for for the job and
[1:29:37] slavery for home and home life and labor
[1:29:40] in a spiritual realm because a kingdom
[1:29:42] suffered violence and a violent take it
[1:29:45] by force can we labor to make a church
[1:29:47] that will be a revival can we labor to
[1:29:50] have some old-fashioned prayer meetings
[1:29:52] can we labor and hold on to the horns of
[1:29:55] the altar for the sick in our midst for
[1:29:57] those who are barely holding on can we
[1:30:00] labor away from selfishness
[1:30:03] if you don't want to press for you press
[1:30:05] for somebody else no if you don't want
[1:30:07] it catch a burden with somebody else
[1:30:09] can the church say amen
[1:30:15] amber branham goes on
[1:30:17] in the messaging unfeeling realities of
[1:30:19] the living god this is about three years
[1:30:20] or so later from hebrews chapter four he
[1:30:23] is horn again he said the bible said
[1:30:26] with stammering lips and other tongues
[1:30:28] will i speak to this people and this is
[1:30:31] the rest of the soul he's saying with
[1:30:33] the holy ghost experience a holy ghost
[1:30:35] fire burning inside your soul is the
[1:30:38] true rest of your soul it would no
[1:30:40] longer be your effort to work to be a
[1:30:43] son and you're trying to overcome and
[1:30:45] you're trying to live a holy life but
[1:30:48] you can rest up because the holy ghost
[1:30:50] is on the throne of your heart you don't
[1:30:52] have to think don't thought of what
[1:30:53] you're saying because the holy ghost
[1:30:55] speaking for you the holy ghost leading
[1:30:57] you the holy ghost guiding you come on
[1:31:00] church
[1:31:02] rest
[1:31:03] for your soul he said this is the thing
[1:31:06] that will come
[1:31:08] hallelujah
[1:31:10] somebody give god praise
[1:31:12] somebody get excited
[1:31:14] anybody want to
[1:31:15] to enter into this thing they were there
[1:31:18] in the upper room they were in one mind
[1:31:20] and one accord they were praising and
[1:31:22] their praise was labor oh hallelujah
[1:31:25] they were worshiping and their worship
