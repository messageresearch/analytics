precious Every Day greetings and Happy Father's Day to all the fathers Among [Music] Us it's a privilege a blessing and honor to be a father it's part of what God himself desired to be and he is so longing in him to express fatherhood amen amen and he longing for us to become fathers in God Amen in the gospel in maturity not children not young men but fathers amen adopted Sons Hallelujah it is his good pleasure that we be adopted he's not scratching his head wondering he wants us to be adopted amen but because of his love and his honor he has to keep his word judgment is not God Vex with people it's not God angry with people judgment is the nature of God because of his Justice and righteousness Hallelujah that is what makes him God and we appreciate him and we love him oh praise God so God bless you again and welcome we certainly appreciate each one of you coming out here this morning and we had a really powerful prayer meeting on Thursday night and I brought exaltation from Isaiah 40 Every Mountain Every Mountain and Hill shall be made low the crooked and even P made straight level rough places made plain and then you're going to see the glory of God do he amplify the voice of one chist prepare ye in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord say clear away obstacles make straight and smooth in the desert a highway for our God Amen so The Valleys have to get built up the mountains have to get level the Crooked places have to make straight and the rough places get smooth in order to make a way for the glory of God to begin to Rule now upon your life isn't that right we talk about the mountains fully hard resistant areas in your life of Pride and unbelief critical attitudes and self-righteousness isn't that right amen talk about the rough places becoming smooth inconsistencies in your lives harshness in relationships to others being impatient and irritable but this one caught me 2 Corinthians 7:14 If my people not not anybody If my people God is very specific he's not talking about others he say my people that are called by my name shall shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their Wicked Ways then you're going to hear from Heaven man God going to heal your land amen humble yourself and that speaks of Brokenness pray pray to realize your dependency upon God Amen I love this one to se God face intimate relationship Hallelujah that have nothing to do with friends and talk and you're watching in front some set sermon listen no no no that's you seeking his face turn from your Wicked Ways repentance that's the only way you could turn from what you're doing you had to repent repent is to turn around like something I preach a while ago about to pleasing God you have to have an intent to please God if you want to improve on your marriage relationship you have to have an intent for that you can't just say you want to improve you want to do this no you have to intent you want to study you have to have an intent and then the desire to study and other things could be added to that but if you don't have an intent to change you'll see Just As You Are and nothing could really move you and change you that is why we read the scripture last service about Jesus asking that young man if you want to be perfect in other words I'm not going to force you you you know yourself you you you do this you do that you do but if you want to be perfect you have something to give up you have something to let go you have to release some of the stuff in your life in order to make room for Perfection to really get a hole upon you because you really want this word to become flesh you really want that you have been Church long enough but you don't want that no more you want this word to become flesh the Bible said and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us it's got to come into your flesh Hallelujah do you believe that hallelujah amen so four things here humble pray seek God's face turn from Wicked Ways that's on our side that's what God asked us if we could do that then Revival is guaranteed on its way then if we do that he said he going to hear our prayer he going to forgive our sins and going toal our could we give the Lord a shout of Praise Hallelujah so Pride flows and shows itself in Independence self-centeredness arrogance when you're praying you show how much you depend upon God isn't that right and the answer to Pride is Brokenness Brokenness [Music] Hallelujah Brokenness what I long for [Music] Brokenness is what I [Music] need Brokenness Brokenness what you want from me from me righteousness right [Music] rightousness what I long for what I long for oh [Music] god oh Hallelujah [Music] right what you want from me from me take my life take my life Hallelujah morning [Music] hallelujah oh transform it take my [Music] will conform me to Oh Glory oh god oh give him some praise right [Music] now Hallelujah yes [Music] yes Glory Hallelujah oh Jesus [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah oh take my life oh take my will Hallelujah [Music] [Music] to your to your oh Lord you may be seated before we go into the scriptures I want to bring something to you amen brother BR remember Church you're living in the best day you will ever live in right now until Jesus comes it will not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse when Russia goes down there for that oil look out that o she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and then we ready for it then in 1914 the world went to war and they had never been at peace since constantly swinging swinging swinging they're holding they're doing the very same thing yet what was they doing holding he say oh God have mercy holding that great thing I saw in the vision the whole thing BEC into destruction holding the atomic holding the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until Israel returns back and get herself together then the the message will go to Israel and she be sealed with the Seal of the Holy Ghost amen after the Gentile is called out amen the people for his name's sake will be called out and the Israel receive a three and a year six Monon message so we know but say he had seven Visions which he said must come to pass before Jesus comes again the seven vision is where America was bummed up he start talk about I know we did this before but feel that to do it again he said the America built two horn civil ecclesiastical Powers lamb freedom of religion but after a while they spoke like a dragon people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time but they are ready for the translation at that time Hallelujah ready to go amen so I want you to understand it's no picnic yeah amen everybody with [Applause] me because they were called Chosen and faithful the elected of God Amen now watch watch there is a pharaoh who knew not Joseph what was Joseph represented question answer the spiritual part of a spiritual Exodus now bear in mind the first Exodus was a natural land to a natural land to the land of Canaan land the second Exodus was from a natural land Canaan land into a spiritual baptism in the upper room the Third Exodus is from a spiritual baptism into the land of the Millennium that's the Third Exodus so what b is saying here is prophecy he said what does Joseph represent he said the spiritual part in this spiritual Exodus that is what Joseph represent yes sir there watch there raises up now we have freedom the woman now of a time but finally a pharaoh dictator this is coming to America Now who knew not the freedom of religion uniting them together don't let this pass you there come a time where there was a pharaoh first had to come there was a pharaoh who raised up who knew not Joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the Exodus so once you see Pharaoh raising up you know we on our way out of here oh Hallelujah because Pharaoh raising up means Moses is coming to deliver the people se he had to die and the next man to raise up who knew not Joseph I don't have to read everything here but while ramse is going in power Moses going in power while the dictator rising in power the bride raising in power God ain't going to leave us like this oh I'm feeling something nowah Hallelujah so you recognize this is not for church members just all church member want is a church to go to all right let's read a little further God per okay let me back up a little bit all right there's a pharaoh who raised up who knew not Joseph that was the beginning of the Exodus and when that thing begin to form one under a political power begin to form form God begin to get ready the iniquity of the amorites was fulfilled the time that he promise Abram was fulfilled the time of Deliverance was at hand God permitted a pharaoh to rise up raise up who knew not Joseph and Ramsey was born after sikam ramse and ramse was was the one who knew not the blessings of Joseph he watch and he didn't know what the spiritual side was and I think if any man was spiritual could see what's taking place now we are getting a pharaoh who knows not freedom of religion and that time he was saying this when our president took his office he would not swear that he believed in freedom of religion this 963 thir exellence but they rais up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph the same thing today a man has raised up took oath in the White House and will not swear to this oat will not take his oat that he believes in freedom of religion when this new pope you talk about oh skip that let's go a little further at the time Ramses in Egypt was growing his power was growing the natural man Ramses was growing the natural man the Antichrist is growing now through politics not the religious yet oh my all right true politics right he already got to the White House in religion he got the people all sced up till they already they actually will fall right for it and the denominational leaders practically everyone every church that's in this nation is already in the confer churches Ramsey is growing they're all United together and what they have what does it do it makes a power a beast like the first one now there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't Unite with it and a boycot it will be too late then you already took the mark don't say I'll do it then you better do it now ramsy was growing remember while Ramsey was growing in power God had Moses in the wilderness he was growing too so it has to have a bride on Earth growing too they have to have a bride coming into Power if the be system coming into Power there's got to be a move of the spirit of God upon a bright Bunch called out by seven tunders because seven tunders gather the bright together get the bright Faith to call for power so they got to have a seven tunder bunch [Applause] Hallelujah they are both growing it will be a Sher one of these days the time ain't far off when there will be a showdown so what's happening in your home that's a showdown that not even a be l or even gol you mean your little family issues and challenges you can't deal with it in a Christian manner I didn't mean to go there this morning that the Pastoral part okay so watch look at the church now calling out coming into oh man here we go watch as the scripture said the natural that the spiritual it's the truth look at the church now calling out coming into Power this is brand now the Holy Spirit coming down the mysteries of God being revealed and set in order and right he's ready in the White House the church is pulling itself together not a denomination out of the bondage of iniquities I just love that away from the Amorite are people that's free Oh Glory to God out of the bondage of iniquities that is knowing to do right and doing wrong you coming out of all of that you're doing the right thing you're saying the right thing you're thinking the right thing you're speaking the right thing you must come out [Applause] right you have nothing to go and make right you made what you have to make right you make it right you have nothing to repent of you already repent of your what you have to done you repent of it the blood is splashed all over you then you are Justified like give never did and you're free your heart free you have confidence and say father Let the Fire Fall they lay hands upon the sick they have to recover because you have faith you have no apology for anybody you walk you walk you fall you get back up you're Son of God you're daughter of God you're not now going to be saved oh we have a bump for you this morning hallelujah praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah you're know not getting saved you're not a fresh recruit you're a soldier did ever see as a soldier Oh Glory to God you're going to fight for every in you're going to get your promise you're going to overcome you're going to get the [Applause] victory so are you ready for the word this morning could we stand want to turn our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 want to read ver vers 11-13 and Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11-1 17 Ephesians 4 verse 11 and they give some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ to be all come in the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man un the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and Hebrews chap 10 from verse 11 we read every priest standed daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of God from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also bear witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them in those days say the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquity will remember no more let's pray father we thank you for your word blessed to our hearts Lord I wait on you Lord make the word be transformed into the lives and hearts of the people we ask in Jesus name May a Spirit come and confirm your word to them amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord hallelujah Glory huj Hallelujah Hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus when the dynamic struck the Pentecostals they could not come to Perfection why this is very important because people looking for Spirit they're looking for power but the Pentecostal got power and spirit and it didn't come true they had powerful testimonies they were speaking in tongues they were Healing The Sick casting out Devils they had a testimony woman one time they got people got so vexed they got shotguns and shoot at them and the bullet just fall down off their clothing without even harming them powerful Miracles powerful testimonies the anointing was blocks away before he even reach the church people were falling down on the streets from the dynamic power that was released 1906 Pentecostal Revival Hallelujah you heard what I said blocks away from the church itself where they were gathered together the people were being healed in the streets the people were fallong in the streets they even have to reach the church the glory and the anointing and the power was emanating from inside out to the people you just had to be there they had testimony piano playing by itself people got Gifts of playing and music when they just get it they just start to play like if they all was playing all kind of Miracles and power yet they couldn't come to Perfection Hallelujah so it takes something more than just Spirit it takes the word and the spirit so God sent the prophet with the word and the Pentecost rejected the prophet and to this day they still have all the gifts they had since way back then because you cannot come to Perfection by gifts come on now come on now not not your preaching gift not your teaching gift not your not your not your tongue speaking gifts you have to only come to Perfection by the word Jesus Christ Hallelujah you have to be C in that Perfection H oh praise the Lord bless amen Hallelujah Glory I feel blessed this morning to know out of millions of people not then I come to this message you know that have been called to Perfection it's a little more than just coming to this message it have endless called to this message but praise God have no Perfection they getting from it at all they have interpretation amen yes so the Pentecostal did not could not take the word that brings discipline to be formed into the word image amen that God would approve Sons this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased remember when brother Brandon went first Pentecost he thought he was among angels all Supernatural and power of God this was the spirit of God and whatnot until a vision broke and he saw one of those gifted men living with somebody else who was not his wife then that thr him into SP what on Earth is this it was the genuine Holy Ghost it was genuine Spirit operation but something was wrong in the Inner Man so he went into the cave to ask God what is this and the god hope of the scriptures Hebrews 6 I believe it was to show him the rainfall on the just and the unjust amen it's the Holy Ghost but the seed is not there it produce a different life [Applause] come on now come on now so it's not just Spirit but a seed which is the word so then he had to reveal son of man who is the S of the seed oh Hallelujah so we today have a revelation of the words of the son of man come on now come on now come on now that's why we could quote it that's why we could preach it that's why we to stay with it because this is not the words of a man it's the revealing of the son of [Applause] man oh Hallelujah some people say we can't preach we are a quot we can't preach um don't quote don't quote don't quote we can't preach yeah we can't preach I can't preach I don't have my own message that's right when the angel came with the book open that was the message I am not the angel I didn't bring down the book I didn't open the book I couldn't look upon the book only the lamb was worthy he took the book he opened the book he Loos the seals and he gave it to a prophet who give it to us hallelujah did you get that he give it to a prophet to give it to us and now we stand here in the book prophesying from the book because the word said prophesy again bring back the prophecies so you are sitting today on the seven tunder Revelation that give us the insight to of the seeds to SW for seventh tunder manifestation oh give the Lord a shout of Praise you're not sitting here in vain you're not believing here in vain you actually under a Sant under inspiration that bring light on the word to show what seeds to show for a seven tunder manifestation in other words you have got this morning a Capstone Revelation waiting for a Capstone manifestation nothing going to stop it Daniel already saw the stone cut it without the hands of man no man Ain bringing this Stone oh I'll give the Lord a scream a shout in the house listen listen if these so-called super ministers super preachers big preachers Mighty Men and all kind of could have bring it why is not here after all these 50 plus years because they can't bring it no man could bring Dynamics it take God to send it Dynamics going to be a reaction to our action oh glory to God did you hear what I said oh W [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah God deliberately shut up the Heavens amen amen and loose sons in the earth say sons have G last days they going to unlock the heavens Heavens about to unlock you know Hallelujah is atmosphere talking to Atmosphere that's why Jesus tell him T in the upper room until he be do with power from on high and Revelation always brings stimulation and the reason the people not excited and in the spirit because they really lack Revelation they have intellectual understanding but when you get Revelation it makes you get excited it makes you get stimulated wine is revelation water is water but wine give mhm oh yes oh yes oh yes why make you misbehave yourself you said might stagger a little bit you must stand up a little bit you can find raise in your hand a little bit you might see smiling you don't know why you're smiling but you're happy happy happy you ever see a drunk man you ever see a drinking man he's smiling smiling smiling well we smiling this morning because we smiling with Revelation that God made the promise he's going to bring it to pass you want be seated I don't care if your House burn down last night if God Gave You Revelation you'll be shouting this morning because another house coming somebody told you another car coming you lose your job I have a next job de all things work take every place you put your foot is yours no devil could no weapon formed come on now don't don't help me oh don't get me started here this morning oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah and now realize I haven't given the title my goodness the title is perfected forever them that are Sanctified that's the title perfected forever them that are Sanctified subject coming into that Perfection inspiration let us go on to Perfection so I know I didn't finish the message I didn't get into the message last week actually last week it was just like a call introduction Al hoping that this morning we could get down into it oh praise godj so brother bam prophesied that the unfolding of the Sevenfold mysteries of God would bring on another Ephesians Amen in Ephesians come on now what we read today we have a promise of a fivefold Ministry yes sir of Pastor Prophet teacher evangelist Apostle amen plus the perfecting of the Saints so God himself put the perfecting of the Saints in Ephesians he himself put it there so we can't go around it we have to go into it all right in other words Perfection will be in another Ephesians that is the promise yes sir therefore the anointing come on now will be only upon the promises yes sir am the seeds that was promised for the bride Hallelujah I could stand here and give you information about Time Magazine Jews Israel that's not the promise of the Bride we can explain the vials the wars the plagues the woman in the sun between the first V and the Seven vile sixth vile and seven vile and all of those stuff amen that's not what we're here [Applause] for the seeds that are promised to the bride therefore all men's ideas all men's interpretation of what the prophet said would die every group every church that twist and turn and interpret it it will die the only thing that with stand is those that stand on the Promises just as the Prophet said it and spoke it because Peter said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature so what the prophet came to introduce was a land of promise it's the Holy Ghost Land Of Promise in the form of word word on top of word on top of word on top of word [Applause] as far as the devil is concerned you wasting time coming to church because as far what he's seeing you're not producing anything but he's a liar he don't understand what God is doing this is what the devil don't get my word shall not return unto me void what

our time this morning let's push time aside let's break into eternity [Applause] Hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah for message the perf Perfection the BR God being infinite who cannot lie cannot speak anything contrary am knows everything just as perfect as in the beginning as he is at the ending just as perfect at the end he was in the beginning God is endless like eternity you can never find the corner of a perfect Circle you could run throughout the ages and Eternity it will never have an end to it that's the way God is he is infinite and perfect he always will be the same he can never change he is perfectly the same now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space my God I'm in my own world here this morning I'm in my own world here this morning he said great circle that chain of perfection was broken by time space time came because of sin the circle was eternity but time broke it listen to these words let's see a perfect circle and my wife call it a little hickey a little drop in the chain eternity continues on but it's not in perfect condition there's a little Gap breaks over this way God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to space of time for trying and the perfecting and the purging of the Lost hallu remember remember we bypass our theophany to be put on Earth to be tested and triy that's why time space come on there's a purpose of time space to get us perfected because when the devil kick that little kicky and and we broke into time space we have to get back into eternity we cannot go back to Eternity perverted we have to go back to Eternity perfected but he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified so you're going to understand why Jesus died to bring blood ah woo my God forgive me I'm excited this morning Jesus died to bring blood sanctifying blood blood that you could understand when he look through that blood he don't see your faults he don't see your mistakes he don't see your failures he see you ah perfected [Applause] hallah Perfection [Music] guaranteed okay so watch God had to do that because Satan caused it to drop down to space time for the trying and the perfecting and the persing of the lost that God by Sovereign Grace might someday lift that little hickey or Gap back into a perfect circle then she rolls on just the same time now time is this Loop it Loops down Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but he stepped into time space and was made flesh and came to here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across the place to redeem it to connect it back to God for eternity you help me my God I feel like going across the horizontal rainbow my God I feel like that old man this place don't have enough room for me this morning did you hear what he did Jesus broke through time space come down here to bring the blood to redeem us to reconnect us back or to that ah and I can't shout this morning my God [Applause] hallelujah you see that's all time is then God when it started here the little kink in A Perfect Circle a little kink in it when God started here he was perfect everything was perfect everything he does is perfect now look before oh my goodness before are you ready before he ever put the printed word this is the mind of God here it isah this is the mind of God that he thought before the found in the world was ever laid that's the reason he could put it on printed word and say what it would be because he saw it before the [Music] foundation it's like you're reading a novel The Novel have past present and future in it if it's a mystery book you could go on the end and see who who do what who the mystery the person you don't want to read the whole thing you you would get the joy of it of course right who done it you go to the end and say okay she she she she done it close the book there's no joy whatsoever because why you are out of the book but you could read present in the book past in the book future in the book that's God because he is in eternity he could see past present and future your future is already done God requires the thing that are past my God your Victory already won glory to God Hall you already healed my already delivered you're going to process you're going to process devil can't stop it your foot your Devils is under your feet oh he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet Oh Glory to God come on you s of God give the Lord a [Applause] shout right with me you may be seated he saw it before the foundation of the world and knew just what it would be and spoke it out and he handed down his knowledge to the prophets Hallelujah Glory so Heaven consists of the word Lord so because God have for knowledge he could drop down in time and the word of the Lord came under Isaiah saying hallelujah the word of the Lord came under Jeremiah saying so these men had the gift to go up into the space of God and pull down knowledge of God speak to the people prophesy son of man prophesy what thou seest I looked and I saw and I prophesy give them the gifts of vision and so on God have his people he has to get the word to the people because that's the how you going to be redeemed you can be Redeemed by his word why because you are thought and the word comes to express you the word come to connect with you so I don't care if he as a professor if you're a gardener a farmer a kitchen worker I don't care what you are the word had to come to you this eternal God had to find you in Trinidad had to find you in your state have to find you in your country he couldn't you couldn't miss it if you try whe on a bus whether by the beach whe in the park whether in a God somebody had to pass this word to [Applause] [Music] you you may be seated so before you were born before you were born God had done put things in place for your parents to be in the right spot to get somebody to tell them about the Gospel of Jesus about the love of Jesus you were when your Baptist Church your mother was Methodist or Pentecostal church or Adventist Church your mother was a d to be there because God going to find you de you like a baby a baby Methodist you not a baby Methodist a

every day every Sunday we preaching about that same God hallelujah they could have come here and find out long time but if they cross that barrier and meet him they're meeting him who we preaching about therefore if you get in contact with him and him call you you should be the most shouting individual in this building this morning because only who he for you who he for you who he for you he

poent only God now the prophet said the church is no longer the voice of God so God going to turn against her he said there's another people in the land under their messenger which will only have one only have one messenger not two and three and four everybody want to be their own private messenger but that not what the prophet said under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age he said once more the world will hear direct from God that not on books and tapes that is not books and tapes Hallelujah once more the world will hear direct from God because the voice of God will be in

of seven Living Voices that's the Thunder that going to shake the devil oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen [Applause] [Applause] oh listen listen the law couldn't make anyone perfect perfection without a revelation is legalism that is what has rampant especially in trinad legalism trying to legislate righteousness or legislate Perfection you can't do it it has failed it has to come by Christ true Christ by the blood through the blood that is what it's all about oh my because if what we do can make us perfect Christ didn't have to die oh give the Lord a shout in the house did you get that is wearing long dress and wearing tie and wear your hair long could make you perfect what what would Christ die just wear long dress we long TI we long here and you're good to goall time my sister came up to me she over I want to show you a Coe she she tell me the quot she said I said I know she say you know that I said yes she said no I don't now she's a bullhead she's disrespectful and I know it but she's trying to check my spirit to see if what she's seeing what she seen in the wood if I seen it too so she could Judge Me by what you read in a book because she find this in the church and that in the church like a time I say you know Church like back I said I said the church back I say better check yourself you must be back the whole church back now that is that is how bad it comes where people could judge you can't judge a church by an by an individual that's crazy you can't judge somebody let somebody come in chur and find this one find that you don't know the person is a visitor you don't the person baptized you don't person is a real believer you don't the person not coming back you don't even know that's right and you're judging she is supposed to look so how she supposed to look when God called you how you were looking that's right you was looking nice Hallelujah when God called you you was smelling nice he was looking nice you wasn't born in sin he was born somewhere else he was born in the hospital well Brethren you whether you born hospital or in a bed in your mother house you were still born in sin amen leading the blood of [Applause] Jesus Hallelujah so I can't God knows I have a problem with men men men men playing God hallelujah men men playing God and the people shaken under fear because they fear the man if you come against him man just will strike you that will strike you that will strike you all that's striking you is fear amen hallelujah not fear God and the preachers come pit they want to put the fear of God in the hearts of the people and what end up happening is the fear the man in the heart of the people not the fear of God the fear of man because we have to work with love let me continue Hall friends there are so many things we could say tonight about Perfection we are always trying to gge out the eyes of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are but if we only look at the picture it is only God's grace that we are what we are hallu so nobody should come in here and feel uncomfortable no you come here and feel like somebody looking down at them just look up at them every they look down at you look up at them and say what you playing anybody playing that they up there we'll tell them the steps to come down coming for you you have to come down and walk with all the rest of us out of the building that's right you can't stay up there and float up there in some and that's the whole point everybody want want to be one up I'm ahead of you I am better than you I am more than you what is it God requires Perfection amen he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him he's looking tonight no matter how much you have sinned no matter how much how little or how much you are still a sinner that's right amen amen that's right I S this small and my brother here next door he's s big so so you have sin measurement now one have a centimeter of sin and one have two feet and that's Corner she had 3T and about the brother behind he have 4T and the other one you can't count count in the yards and miles but big sin amen and small sin in God's sight the same sin could we give the Lord a praise so big sin needs blood and small sin needs blood because God is perfect that's what the blood came for to bring that [Applause] Perfection hallelujah hallelujah so no matter how much you sin how little how much you're still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever think of it it's nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Christ Jesus amen amen wow hallelujah hallelujah it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so it's a perfect Kingdom must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to the perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride amen so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God the Waters of Separation that watches us from sins the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word I love that description the bloody word when you leave here this morning you must feel that dripping bloody word upon your life you're not supposed to leave it with condemnation you supposed to leave here even with a possibility of being restored being made whole being made well I can't solve every problem I'm not a psychologist a psychiatrist but God knows your problem God knows your situation and God love and care enough for you that that his Spirit could withraw you to come here this morning that you could be edified and blessed that you could be helped and you could be strengthened oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord do you believe that oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah Glory so therefore we are perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us are you above Temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God could no more judge us than nothing he already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you he can't judge me [Music] again that's the Revelation that's the Revelation that's the Revelation that's the revelation Christ was judged we were in him we have already been judged therefore this morning you are [Applause] free hallelujah hallelujah then I wish I had the voice of the Archangel to bring it to a place where you could see it you have to see it then you are free Oh Glory to God woman go and S no more who the son of man set free is free [Applause] indeed Glory may you may be seated this have been a tough one to really get through last week struggling I have 16 pages and I want page three so you know I ain't get very far but Bram the God of this world this some Satan Eden the God of this world today the worship person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan it's Satan imperson himself as the church now this is deep this is not skim milk there's not no devil there with no two horn and red with a big fork we could see that one because said that is him but this one here is the one we want to focus on it is Satan imperson himself as the church they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church aha so now it come back now to what it really is so then they love their Church they love what they see they love their dreams they love what they feel they love the emotions they don't love the word when the word come because the word checks them the word always come to check you that's what the word come to check me I'm not saying this to you you know I'm hearing it just like you do you know some of the things I'm hearing for the first time you know some of the things are jamming just the same you know but I've got to speak it I still have to say it I can't hold back because I've got to speak it still Hallelujah [Applause] watch they worship Satan thinking they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan done it the way you see wait a minute we preach the word look back here at my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word to eph he said God had said it was a misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he would let you know all Jesus did was perfectly well he would let you know what all MOS did was perfectly well when you you take the promises that they give for this day then that was apply to another age people ignorantly worshiping Satan thinking they are worshiping God as we are warned by prophecy and this is some Paul in first in Thessalonians we be se you Brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus and by the Gathering Together of him the coming of the Lord Gathering of him that that you be not soon shaken or troubled in spirit or in your mind let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they come a falling away first we're not talking about backsliding falling away now we talking about a fall away from God I following from the word I follow away from the promises I follow from prophetic utterance I following from that yes yes yes Hallelujah until the man of be revealed he said now this deceitfulness of the church today the son of pedition now people worshiping Satan in his this day thinking they worshiping God now let's let him tell us what that is they are worshiping him through a Creed we believe this did the prophet say that no you can't find it but it revealed it's a hidden Mystery well hide it from me please keep that one hidden watch they're worshiping through a Creed a manmade denominations and Creeds that brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known no matter how much the word of God promised for this day is preached and Vindicated they still won't believe it you Holiness people we believe in sanctification and you're taking your own you just quit this and quit that unless Christ opened the door and Quicken it to your heart and you come to a place where sin is dead and desire is all gone it's self-righteousness so the neck Buton up right here the all cloth Buton up right here they dress down to the ankle and they Hol people and they don't press the hair and they don't wear makeup and they don't wear earrings they don't wear this don't we that but that is the only self-righteousness until Christ come into your heart doesn't matter if you wear camel skinall and you come out the Wilderness and you B for days Christ is still in your life that's John the Baptist hallelujah praise God oh Hallelujah are you with me how can we be perfect true death of Christ is not Church joining oh blessed be the name of the Lord so when the new bir come in you are changed you don't have to do anything to prove it Hallelujah your life proves it as you walk you will love peace longsuffering gentleness meekness patience that's what you are and the whole world sees the reflection of Christ in you brother Bram I've seen Visions sick healed dead raise when they were laying out there and doctors walk away they finished and gone lay there a couple of hours and Holy Spirit come back and show a vision go down there and raise that person up deaf dumb blind walk that is not it that's just attributes amen amen all right oh Hallelujah Paul said we'll do all this but lay all that aside now let's go into Perfection the church cannot be perfected through organizations it's get further away from God all all the time or further away from each other we draw barriers we separate ourselves seemingly not having the faith and then we leave those principles of the doctrine if we move into Perfection then those little things become not of much use all right all right amen you see it cling clang sword with Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine but when you start going to Perfection them Sword Play A account amen hallelujah deal with the bull is what counts Hallelujah dealing with the maniac man is what counts dealing with the be is what counts and Doctrine can't cut down the bull am Doctrine can't send back the bees am it will take Perfection to do [Applause] that hallu Hallelujah so that's why B said love came over him and then he tell the bull stop love send the bees love dealt with this love what is that that is perfection Hallelujah but this is deep he said we go into a relationship and we find out the only way that we can be perfected is to be in Christ we find out then by the teachings of the Bible That's not how we get into Christ not by water baptism not by laying on hands not by teaching not by teaching but by one Spirit we are baptized into one body and become perfected through his suffering then we look different we think different we act different we live different not because it's a Duty or we belong to church but because the love of God is shed abroad am Hallelujah in your heart the love of God strike your heart charity bearth all things so are you so Hasty you need charity God exposing your hastiness to say you're Hasty you're Hasty Hy no trying to show you your need because charity suffer it long and is kind it doesn't puff itself up it's not easily provoked it believeth all things it hopeth all things it enoth all things charity never fail it all right could we take a little more they got to take a little more because I'm not finished yet and tomorrow is a holiday caught you caught you caught you red-handed you thought you was going to escape all right okay here we go now God was this great spirit we pictured him a circle catry of the Earth but God is eternal he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect satisfaction here we go are you ready all those seven spirits as we get in Revelations they come out and made up of God God was Perfection everything else outside of that has been something perverted from that amen now the only way we can come back back to Perfection is to come back to that Perfection which is God then we come to Perfection then we have eternal life oh Hallelujah so what is he saying the seven spirits that come out of God the rainbow that is perfection amen so we have to come to that Perfection which is the rainbow which is the Seven Virtues which is the seven voices which is the seven Mysteries we have to come back to that Perfection oh hallelujah oh glory to God my GL Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah horizontal rainbow how you getting that GL to God you know the rainbow this way right the horizontal rainbow this way there was a rainbow around the throne God first Throne was in heaven second throne in Jesus Christ now going and put his throne in the heart of the the bride amen a rainbow going to be around your throne yes sir the throne around your life a rainbow around your throne oh it going to be God man in the earth hallu it will be deity revealed in human beings deity in the heart of man oh brother say I long to come in a church sin can't stay here the Holy Spirit going to call it right out he said going to happen again it going to come back again a perfect church are you looking for it are you expecting it do you desire it oh hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah so we have to come back to that Perfection isn't that right so God take the seven voices seven spirits Through The Seven Ages and gather up in a son of man amen that was the son of man seven voices became one voice voice of the son of man and that son of man spoke out words of promises and these words of Pro promises going to turn back into seven perfect Spirits so God collected all his scattered word tied back in the word to bring back the Holy Ghost but Ram gathered up all this scattered word hallelujah then in him was son of man the son of man revealing the son of man Hallelujah and the son of man brought words of promises promises promises promises and drop it on a bride and pastors and ministers supposed were supposed to come behind the prophet and Echo those same promises to drop it in the hearts of the people because the secret is the word is in the bride devil don't understand that we like a time bomb we like a ticking clock for the word to be transformed to power devil will understand ABR for 25 years this is God bringing in Christian maturity this is God testing us writing Us by the word itself to see if we will stay with this word regardless of Trials regardless of the internet regardless of all them demon powers regardless all the filth all the sex all the lust all the nakedness all the pornography regardless of all of that God purpose that there'll be a bride that will stay with this word that will come true and this morning you getting to understand you are perfected forever those that are Sanctified perfected forever you have to come to that sanctification by the blood of Jesus that will take you further into the spirit oh Hallelujah you stay Sanctified until the Spirit come and the spirit will come because the spirit is a promise oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah the Bible talk about if a son air Hallelujah a son that air but if the son is a child amen you can't give the inheritance to a child the Galatians say you put that child under tutes and governors until the time appointed of the father time appointed of the father where he come into the full inheritance so that child has to be tuted and trained to come into the father's business Jesus said I must be about my father's business and the father came and approved Jesus qualified to run his business amen and Jesus said as my father send me so send I you oh Hallelujah he said Sons coming not Believers Sons Sons and Daughters the creation is groaning for the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God hallu oh glory to God Hallelujah to this Perfection coming by seven spirits ministers believing that they going make it just so Rapture and God comeing so it's not like that you know it will take the manifestation of the Holy Spirit Seath nature of God thundering Christ back in the church or we could go in Christ not back in the church he said him moving in and out then we worshiping the living Christ my God you don't have to wait for thatall come here with your fire start it at home don't come here for fire and or bring your fire Hallelujah bring your fire from home when you understand that you will never come here without your fire you would light the fire in your home home because that is where the Revival have to start that's where the excitement the enthusiasm the expectation you coming from home believing God will do something special for you I'm longing to see people longing for looking for miracles people stop looking for miracles they stop looking for healing they stop looking for deliverance they stop looking for breakthrough that's wrong that's wrong our God is a mighty God [Applause] I go by the doctor I go by the doctor yeah yeah but I'm not telling I'm not hearing that passion I I got a breakthrough I to get a healing I to get Deliverance I'm not hearing that speak it some of you don't want to speak it because you really want it yet have to be in your heart Caleb said I brought word as it was in my heartall those other brothers they went inside the land ministers under the prophet Moses listen to Moses books and tips went in the land and say and they bring back evidence you know but they see Giants too why didn't hush about the Giants why just bring the evidence Al Saints look the evidence here give a shout hallelujah but they give evidence and the giant talk was so big people stop looking at the evidence then so frighten a hand with her grips could share much s every but chance if you see them all of a sudden that grap come so small C come late God oring things God let the unbelief sweep sweep Sweep All who want to believe that nonsense they see God open up the Red Sea they see God do this God do that all them bunch of Believers they're reading spoken books just like all of you here they have no right to take that nonsense they don't have to take no Minister's foolishness and Par in the beef behind the pulpit they don't have to take that because but didn't live that but Bram did not live what them preachers living right now you live a life of humility Oh Glory and demonstrated the the spirit of Christ to the people and to enemies and to [Applause] everyone don't be a sucker for deception at all no no no no no be free to believe what God Said in this word the minister should be held accountable bam say I am depending upon you to carry out the word that I brought he said God is dependent upon me to bring the word and I'm dependent upon you to carry out that word oh he hit the battle let's run with it brother he passed the battle on to a pride let's run with [Applause] it when Joshua and Caleb come atmosphere change you know people can change atmosphere you have a good friends friends laugh and smile and somebody come and they come

I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I will seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this tat of M till I can become a manifestation of the living Christ for he became sin like me here we go that I might become righteous of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his now cuz that's the purpose he died for how many will pledge the same thing Hallelujah I know you raise your hands but I want to read it againu for you to know what pledging to he said I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray I will seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing that's a whole different flowing in this statue of Minds till I become a manifestation of the living Christ for he became sin like me that I may become righteous of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his now cuz that's the purpose he died for how many will pledge the same thing by the grace of God oh how I pledge it Lord this church pledges it the full statue of Jesus Christ [Applause] am oh Hallelujah I can't stop now I had to finish this here now Hallelujah so Jesus he the spirit of God dwelt in the fullness in Jesus Christ Jesus was the word and the words was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh then the word becomes visible so when you begin to see visible evidence and manifestation of God in our midst it would means that the word is becoming flesh because as the word becomes flesh the invisible becomes visible you're going to see God you're going to see God Amen Let Me prophesy you will see God you will see the invisible become visible right in front of your eyes hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God oh Hallelujah so this invisible God is the word amen Ministry of the word but the visible going to be the ministry of the spirit Hallelujah from the guide the Holy Spirit watch remember faith and virtue now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building of God until these things are operating by the spirit amen he didn't say by Revelation he didn't say by intellect he said the virtues have to begin to operate by the spirit when that begin toer your spirit is subconscious behavior is not sister coming so oh gosh I I she a nice smile God bless you Sister no that that's you operating it that's right that's not operating by the spirit operating by the spirit means it's thundering it's flowing it's living through you you can't even help it now I didn't read the story when B say we always trying to Gorge somebody eyes but he had an experience he went to a restaurant and there was a woman there middle age short pants on talking with some man music playing and he said God is this a place that you're going to raise up my children to be in why don't you condemn this place he felt a top on his shoulder God pull him to the side broke a vision upon him he saw himself as a child all the sins he doing and whatnot his sins coming up to God he saw the blood of Jesus as a bumper pushing it off he saw a book with all his sins in it and God M pardon put the see of forgetfulness and then God tell him I forgive you and you condemn her now I know preachers Don't Preach about that because much condemnation going on they they don't want to hear about that God told him I you condemn I I forgive you go do tell nothing more again nothing more nothing more that's just a vision let's see what he going to do now so he comes to the woman and say woman listen listen listen I was just condemning you and I was saying this and saying and God show me this the want said to break in tears she said I was a Christian and this happened and that happened and her back sliding and whatnot and right there on the floor they kneel down in the floor in the restaurant and that woman was restored back right on the floor because the man get a revelation that the blood is not only for him come on now come on now some people might have walked inside of that and when they see the woman carrying on so you walk back out not me and that Banner not me and that restaurant but the experience change brother Mam's perspective to see through the eyes of God amen hallelujah God don't see as man sees that's the problem today I don't have it here but brother Bram said how would God take these unlearned fishermen to put them in ministries for the perfecting of the Saints why would God bypass the theological experts in the book of Moses in the form of Pharisees and sagues who already know the word that's right them listening to tapes since their youth yes them reading scriptures from s the bab they since a talk then the lineage of scriptures so it would have been sensible to get these educated scripture taught people to take on the ministry but God don't think the way man thinks God went for find people who was never in those scriptures Peter was just I know smoking grass whatever it is smoking and drinking and whatever it is Peter was just fisherman and God said I come to call you to fish for men not not not them fishermen thing they different kind of fish come come come I'll make you a fisher of men come follow me James follow me philli follow me ordinary men tax collector too nobody loves the tax collector nobody lik CES to come and from them but Jesus make sure he picked that one too come come come come follow me too hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he set it up so so they they have the friends who they like to be following Jesus Jesus do picking if Jesus said Peter pick pick 12 Peter pick family relatives friends all know Partners everybody I follow you Jesus Jesus didn't let Peter do the picking that's why he let them ministers do no picking let no convention do no picking let no brother this and brother that Apostle this and apostle that Prophet this and Prophet that no do picking he will do the choosing [Music] look look look look look look Holy Ghost F men Upper Room Holy Ghost fell upon them stagger and whatnot the first thing they had to do was to pick a man and the church vote for Maas God didn't vote for him right God had nothing to do with that that their choice God choose a man Nam Saul a hook no Jews who not easy who not easy I want to add that part that's right amen nobody think he coming through you know because he is sa he against the church he riding shotgun he coming against the Christians all of a sudden when the book say time to call him time to call him up God just do so on di phone Pillar of Fire hit him so right there he son and said who are the Lord son talk all the time he think he's a Pharisee the Pharisee and he's this and he is that he all position all them things is only in a human Spirit you know when God blow that out all them Believers BNG all about different churches when the Holy Spirit Begin to Fall it blow all them interpretation all only floating around them that's not
