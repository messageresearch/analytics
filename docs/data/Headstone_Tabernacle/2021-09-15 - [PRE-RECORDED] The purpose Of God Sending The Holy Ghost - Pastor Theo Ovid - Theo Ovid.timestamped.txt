[28:56] scriptures tonight from sin john chapter
[28:59] 14
[29:00] verse 14 to 26 and luke chapter 16 1
[29:03] verse 8 verse 16. it's in john
[29:06] chapter 14
[29:08] reading verse 14. if you shall ask
[29:10] anything in my name i will do it if you
[29:13] love me keep my commandments and i will
[29:14] pray the father this is jesus talking
[29:17] and he will give you another comforter
[29:20] so referencing another comforter because
[29:22] he himself being among them he was a
[29:24] comforter with them but he's talking
[29:26] about another comforter so he was the
[29:28] word and he's prophet sign of the spirit
[29:31] i shall give you another comforter that
[29:32] he may abide with you forever
[29:35] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[29:38] cannot receive
[29:39] this is not the spirit of error now
[29:41] there's not a spirit of lies this spirit
[29:43] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[29:45] because it's hit him not you don't know
[29:46] it him but he know it you you know him
[29:49] for he dwelleth with you
[29:50] shall be in you i will not leave you
[29:53] comfortless i will come to you yet a
[29:55] little while the world is happy no more
[29:58] but you see me because i live you shall
[29:59] live also at that day you shall know
[30:02] that i am in my father and even me and i
[30:05] knew she's saying to them you don't know
[30:07] that now but at that day you will know
[30:08] this
[30:10] verse 21 he didn't have my commandments
[30:11] and keep it them jesus that love at me
[30:14] he that loved me shall be loved of my
[30:15] father and i will love him i will
[30:17] manifest myself to him
[30:19] and judah said unto him not a scarred
[30:21] lord how is it that thou would manifest
[30:23] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[30:26] answer jesus answered and said unto him
[30:28] if a man loved me he will keep my words
[30:31] and my father will love him and we will
[30:34] come unto him and will make our board
[30:36] with him he that loved me not keeping
[30:38] not my sins and the word which he hear
[30:41] is not mine but the father which sent me
[30:44] these things have i spoken unto you
[30:46] being yet present with you but
[30:49] but
[30:50] the comforter which is the holy ghost
[30:53] whom the father will send in my name
[30:55] send
[30:57] operating word whom the father will send
[30:59] in my name he shall teach you all things
[31:03] and bring all things to your remembrance
[31:05] what's up since that time the kingdom of
[31:08] god is preached on every man
[31:10] you speak to them take me out of that
[31:12] peter was con responsible for what he
[31:15] shared by words
[31:17] to cornelius house
[31:19] but lord he was not responsible for the
[31:21] movement of the spirit and the dynamic
[31:23] operation of the holy spirit that fell
[31:26] on cornelius and the gathering at
[31:27] cornelius home
[31:29] because the scripture declared why peter
[31:31] yet spake these words the holy ghost
[31:34] fell upon them that heard the word it
[31:36] was such a shocking thing to peter and
[31:38] the other jews with him they were
[31:40] astonished that the holy ghost itself
[31:42] was being poured out upon the gentiles
[31:45] just as they had had it in the upper
[31:47] room and it was an astonishing thing for
[31:48] them to see it so peter wasn't in charge
[31:51] of opening that pipe of the spirit you
[31:53] are in charge of that lord and we pray
[31:55] that you would come down tonight and
[31:57] open up in the people's hearts and lies
[31:59] right in their homes the fire of god the
[32:01] healing virtue of christ the deliverance
[32:04] lord the witness of your spirit the
[32:06] power of god even right now while we are
[32:08] praying may the dove sweep into every
[32:10] home every heart every life lord and
[32:12] bring that victory to them lord oh god
[32:15] we are depending on you tonight
[32:18] uh our words will fail lord but your
[32:21] words can feel and we believe that we
[32:23] are moving to that cycle father of the
[32:25] spirit uh having the preeminences of the
[32:28] spirit having the oversight for your
[32:30] deepest desire is to see your sons in
[32:33] such a position that you can say there
[32:35] is my spirit flowing freely no hidden
[32:37] agenda no politics no unclean spirit no
[32:41] crooked life just a channel of god that
[32:44] you can flow freely father god may you
[32:46] find such a place the night in our
[32:48] hearts where you're knocking all the
[32:50] doors and you are available to every
[32:52] crevice in our lives that with the
[32:54] freedom of spirit lord the liberty and
[32:57] of god that the word could be
[32:59] operational tonight lord in jesus name
[33:01] we ask it amen and amen
[33:06] okay so tonight our title
[33:09] the purpose of god sent in the holy
[33:12] ghost that's the title tonight
[33:14] the purpose of god said in the holy
[33:15] ghost i have an inspiration every man
[33:18] must press
[33:20] every man must press i like to
[33:23] always find things that we are
[33:24] responsible for you know like how the
[33:27] bible says the secret thing belongs to
[33:28] god with things that are revealed belong
[33:30] to us isn't that right so secrets god in
[33:33] charge of that but what belong to us
[33:35] belongs to us what is has been revealed
[33:37] amen now
[33:39] uh let's let's go see what the law will
[33:41] do to tonight
[33:44] now have you ever seen have you ever
[33:45] seen this you see in our churches today
[33:48] even the groups where we have separated
[33:50] ourselves and make organization
[33:52] we see all of this and you've seen a man
[33:55] here we go
[33:57] pick up a certain scripture
[33:59] and brother
[34:00] that man can take that scripture
[34:03] and make it live new make it live just
[34:06] exactly what is promising in the bible
[34:09] and the next man will see him do it and
[34:11] he will come along and try to do it and
[34:14] fail
[34:15] i hope you're reading now he'll feel why
[34:17] the scripture is not inspired to him
[34:21] he's only trying to impersonate he's
[34:23] trying to act like something
[34:26] watch he said no watch but what about
[34:28] the church what kind of messiah is the
[34:30] church looking for today the church has
[34:32] been crying the lotus we're holding
[34:34] about a messiah we are looking revival
[34:37] in our time what are they looking for to
[34:39] do it what more do you want what
[34:43] does the church want anyhow we already
[34:45] got it
[34:46] god give it to us
[34:48] it's his promise for this hour
[34:52] we look in the bible
[34:54] we see it everywhere through the bible
[34:56] anointed ones come on and make that word
[35:00] live again
[35:01] listen to it
[35:03] anointed ones
[35:05] if it's not anointed how could it really
[35:08] live
[35:09] it will take the atmosphere the presence
[35:12] the power
[35:14] the anointing to make that word live dry
[35:17] dead cold formal
[35:19] no life coming to that it has to be
[35:22] the breath of god
[35:23] so here it is now anointed ones come on
[35:26] and make that word live again right in
[35:28] the hour for that over now we have got
[35:30] the messiah this is him the word in the
[35:33] beginning was the word the word was with
[35:35] god the word was god and the word
[35:38] remains god the same yesterday therefore
[35:40] we are wanting a messiah and god give us
[35:43] the messiah what's the messiah his
[35:46] promised
[35:47] word
[35:48] for this day
[35:50] it's just waiting
[35:52] for somebody
[35:54] with faith to anoint it and make it live
[35:57] again
[35:58] oh praise the name of the lord so i want
[36:01] to encourage you tonight
[36:03] that all we have need of is in the
[36:05] message of the hour is in the books
[36:08] is in the tapes but it takes fear to
[36:10] anoint every divine promise
[36:12] and you have to claim it for yourself
[36:14] isn't that right so you said he says no
[36:17] martin luther had mechanics and dynamics
[36:18] of this day
[36:20] john wesley had them
[36:22] pentecostal had them of their day what
[36:24] about our day
[36:26] this is another time
[36:28] the church should be fully grown now
[36:30] ready to meet christ
[36:32] with
[36:33] the manifestation of every blessing that
[36:37] he promised in the bible operating in
[36:40] that one great body where he promised he
[36:42] would meet the people and be worshipped
[36:44] in this great church of his oh blessed
[36:47] be the name of the lord do we believe
[36:48] that tonight that the church should be
[36:50] fully grown ready to meet christ with
[36:52] what with books and tapes no with the
[36:54] manifestation of every blessing that he
[36:58] promised in the bible operating in that
[37:00] one great body where he promised he
[37:03] would meet the believer the people and
[37:05] be worshipped
[37:06] oh praise god so god's purpose of
[37:08] sending the holy spirit is one purpose
[37:11] one purpose that god himself might dwell
[37:14] in his church
[37:16] and continue his plans through the
[37:18] church and that's why the holy spirit
[37:21] told the prophet pick up the pen and
[37:22] write by and through the bride will be
[37:25] fulfilled all that was promised isn't
[37:27] that right that god was in christ
[37:30] continuous plans through christ out of
[37:32] christ into the church continuing his
[37:34] work through the church all god was he
[37:37] coming to christ all that christ was he
[37:39] poured into the church what is it god
[37:44] working in you
[37:45] anywhere in the world that he would want
[37:48] to call on you working in you to do his
[37:51] good will oh we ought to thank god for
[37:54] that thank god the holy spirit is sent
[37:57] for the purpose of god living in his
[38:00] church moving through each age
[38:02] isn't that right he was lifted up
[38:04] between the heaven and earth died and
[38:06] redeemed everything and in bleeding
[38:08] hallelujah he sanctified a church that
[38:11] he himself might live in not come to
[38:14] church now his blood is what sanctified
[38:17] the church because he could only come to
[38:19] a sanctified life oh glory to god and
[38:22] that's why it was so powerful the
[38:25] testimony of cornelius he was just
[38:28] and devout and amanda was praying always
[38:32] he don't know about jesus hallelujah he
[38:35] don't know what's going to unfold but
[38:36] the god was so pleased with his prayer
[38:40] and his testimony that god sent
[38:42] visitation of an angel to tell him to
[38:44] send for peter because peter was part of
[38:46] this body of christ this operational
[38:49] functional book of acts this channel of
[38:52] god that life could come out the mouth
[38:54] of peter oh glory to god and peter on
[38:58] new grounds was challenged to rise and
[39:00] kill and eat and he was challenged to go
[39:02] to these gentiles call to minister to
[39:05] the gentiles oh glory to god and all
[39:07] peter has to do was to give a witness
[39:09] and testimony by word of what happened
[39:12] and why he was given testimony while he
[39:15] was speaking while he was witnessing
[39:17] what he saw what he experienced the
[39:19] spirit bore witness oh glory to god and
[39:22] once more the spirit will return and is
[39:25] returning and has returned to be a
[39:28] witness the bible said the lord himself
[39:30] went everywhere with them confirming the
[39:33] word not a hope this is a blessing to
[39:35] you not that confirming the word with
[39:37] signs following or give the lord a shout
[39:40] in the house supernatural power
[39:42] supernatural vindication supernatural
[39:45] presence all glory to god people have to
[39:47] they they're afraid of the supernatural

[40:07] the desire of the smoke take the desire
[40:09] to lust take the desire to live all kind
[40:11] of crazy life god working in your life
[40:14] oh hallelujah praise god so he was
[40:17] lifted up between heaven
[40:18] died and redeemed everything and then
[40:21] bleeding he sanctified a church that he
[40:24] himself might live in and fellowship and
[40:28] commune with that lost spot of
[40:30] fellowship from the garden of eden where
[40:33] god came down in the cool of the evening
[40:36] and i could see why god leave these last
[40:39] day sons to receive the full revelation
[40:41] of the mystery of god that he could
[40:43] fully commune with them and have
[40:45] fellowship with them what a privilege to
[40:47] be in this hour it's crazy outside the
[40:50] dear it is crazy and will get crazier
[40:52] but we are blessed and privileged
[40:54] because many wise men and prophets long
[40:56] to be in such a time as this when the
[40:58] birth hallelujah when the sons of god
[41:01] will be born into manifestation oh this
[41:03] is great tonight hallelujah just the

[43:50] heart and takes it aboard there's a
[43:52] taste and hungering for lost souls

[44:25] eden where god could talk to you and you
[44:26] could talk back to him where the spirit
[44:28] is dear the bible said jesus said you
[44:31] are not a comforter and he will bring
[44:33] things to your remembrance what i have
[44:34] spoken unto you oh glory to god you're
[44:36] with me like a fool praise god you will
[44:39] get back the same word that was spoken
[44:41] before it will come back again i'll ride
[44:44] the trail once more oh glory to god he
[44:46] will bring it back to remembrance
[44:48] hallelujah because god can't change his
[44:50] word he subject his own self to his word
[44:53] oh blessed be name of the lord as soon
[44:55] as the church
[44:56] gets his church and his speaking
[44:57] conditions gets his church to a place
[45:00] where he can flow himself through and
[45:03] love and persuade and fellowship then
[45:06] there will come an eden so where does
[45:08] that put all the legalists down where he
[45:10] want to get the spirit that he could
[45:12] flow and love and persuade that's the
[45:15] spirit of god brooding hallelujah that
[45:17] is not thou shalt not and though shall
[45:19] that law get lick up long time god after
[45:21] they couldn't obey the law that's why
[45:23] you make a new covenant oh glory to god
[45:25] you want your faith to be motivated by
[45:27] the love love for him love for the
[45:29] course love for his people oh glory to
[45:31] god hallelujah when that love is dear
[45:34] then you could
[45:35] step out on the limb then you can accept
[45:37] challenges because there's a love of god
[45:39] in your soul oh praise god so come back
[45:42] even he would take his church back we
[45:44] had left him back to eden again and
[45:46] watch this where will be taken back
[45:48] again
[45:49] and so on oh hallelujah
[45:52] praise god notice now
[45:54] god as the light began to shine in last
[45:56] days
[45:57] here we go he's expecting us he is
[46:00] expected so god has an expectation
[46:04] you know people don't wait in the lord
[46:05] reason lord listen to this he
[46:08] is expecting us a great thing from us
[46:12] oh glory to god hallelujah if you were
[46:14] here in the church i would tell you turn
[46:15] around and tell somebody he's expecting
[46:17] a great thing from us
[46:18] he's aggressive great thing from you
[46:20] he's expecting a great thing from you
[46:22] come on now another little thing you
[46:24] know
[46:25] a great thing
[46:27] oh glory to god if your mind don't hold
[46:29] that you're in trouble
[46:31] oh glory to god you know i was saying
[46:33] some of my wife us telling them how
[46:36] you know there's a reason
[46:37] why god didn't show israel the shortcut
[46:40] to go into the promised land
[46:42] it's the reason why there was a shorter
[46:44] way i think 11 days or something they
[46:46] got to hit the land
[46:47] but god wanted to see if
[46:50] he could get them to change their minds
[46:53] because they came out of egypt but egypt
[46:56] didn't come out of them
[46:58] so he's wanting to come out of egypt is
[47:00] another thing to get egypt out of the
[47:02] people
[47:03] because he understood and knew how the
[47:06] human nature is
[47:07] as soon as pressure come they want to go
[47:09] back to the comfort zone
[47:11] they don't want to go beyond to see
[47:13] where they call to
[47:15] it is easy to rock back where they were
[47:18] before
[47:19] and even peter and the disciples found
[47:21] themselves in that position after three
[47:23] and a half years with jesus after doing
[47:26] miracles after seeing miracles after
[47:28] seeing power once jesus was no longer
[47:32] wrong they went back fishing to the
[47:34] original thing that they were in
[47:35] that was the easy thing for them to do
[47:38] and he told them i come to call you out
[47:40] of fishing for fish and make you a
[47:41] fisher of men that's what the calling
[47:43] was but those guys fell right back to
[47:46] the comfort zone right back to what
[47:48] they're custom with and it is easy to do
[47:51] that hallelujah it takes effort to press
[47:55] beyond where you are to where you're
[47:57] supposed to be
[47:58] hallelujah and they say the law and the
[48:00] prophets were until john and since that
[48:02] time the kingdom is preached and every
[48:05] man pressed their way into it hallelujah
[48:08] the kingdom itself have to be preached
[48:10] and you have to press your way you have
[48:12] to see yourself moving forward the press
[48:14] is to push hollywood to battle to fight
[48:17] not to sit back and relax to push
[48:19] yourself oh glory to god you don't want
[48:22] to just do and enter in you want to do
[48:24] better you want to do the very best oh
[48:26] glory the god is adored here and you
[48:29] have to bust past that door hallelujah
[48:31] press into the kingdom of god oh glory
[48:34] to god that woman with a blood issue
[48:36] that's what she was doing hallelujah
[48:39] there was a range that that the people
[48:41] was a wrong jesus but she had a need and
[48:43] that need made her push herself she ran
[48:46] out of money a husband tell her to go to
[48:48] that small church she had everything
[48:49] negative around her but she told herself
[48:52] if i could touch the hem of his garment
[48:54] i would be made whole or glory to god
[48:56] she told herself something sometimes you
[48:57] have to talk to yourself sometimes you
[48:59] have to encourage yourself sometimes
[49:00] they look in the mirror and say listen
[49:02] you're not going there you're supposed
[49:03] to go in you have to change your mind
[49:05] you have to change your thinking you
[49:06] have to press and did that woman press
[49:08] she pressed away oh glory to god
[49:11] everybody wrong jesus but she didn't
[49:12] have that kind of thing she didn't come
[49:14] to just hear him she wanted to get a
[49:16] touch she wanted to get an answer she
[49:18] wanted to get her healing she wanted to
[49:20] get her deliverance she was desperate oh
[49:23] glory to god are you desperate tonight
[49:25] because to get certain things on god
[49:27] you've got to be desperate
[49:29] oh
[49:31] watch he's expecting us
[49:33] a greeting from us because
[49:36] where there's much given there's much
[49:38] required so he is going to require
[49:41] much more of us than he did of the
[49:45] lutherans or the methodists because we
[49:47] walk in a greater light that's why our
[49:49] rejectedness
[49:51] reject formality and reject the message
[49:54] spirit i got rejected the trinity spirit
[49:56] all of that be getting blasted and
[49:58] busted we want holy spirit oh glory to
[50:01] god and you had to jump out of your
[50:02] human spirit shouldn't that spirit
[50:05] whatever spirit i'm coming to the holy
[50:07] spirit there is one holy spirit if it in
[50:10] india africa wherever that holy spirit
[50:12] is one behavior going with it it's the
[50:14] old time holy spirit and the devil won't
[50:16] go near it that's the reason people fear
[50:18] it but it's good enough for me
[50:21] oh glory to god give me that old-time
[50:23] religion it's still all time
[50:25] isn't that right
[50:26] so he said no because we walk in a
[50:28] greater light with a greater power with
[50:30] a greater witness than they had we have
[50:33] a greater witness of the resurrection we
[50:35] have things more firmer
[50:36] than the hand
[50:38] all right
[50:39] hallelujah
[50:41] god
[50:42] doesn't deal with the church
[50:44] just as an organization
[50:46] he doesn't deal with the church as a
[50:48] group of people
[50:50] he deals with the church as individuals
[50:52] so the ministers who try to tell the
[50:54] group that la group is it he is lying to
[50:58] them and deceiving them because god is
[51:02] not dealing with the church as a group
[51:05] he is dealing with individuals in the
[51:07] group oh glory to god hallelujah just as
[51:11] the church can't hold the holy ghost as
[51:13] a group because the holy ghost is poured
[51:15] out on individuals that is why i believe
[51:17] tonight people in their homes could
[51:20] receive the holy ghost tonight not next
[51:22] week tonight because the holy ghost is
[51:25] poured out on individuals hallelujah and
[51:27] even while the word is going forward now
[51:29] you can receive the holy ghost the
[51:31] operation of god could come right in
[51:33] your home so he said watch he deals with
[51:36] the church as individuals each
[51:40] individual in the church so i care about
[51:42] dice let's one man fool me i want to
[51:45] make sure is the word of god is the
[51:48] promise of the hour i want to make sure
[51:51] that this what i'm seeing as a vision
[51:53] even the prophetic vision is the right
[51:54] one i don't want to wake up and say hey
[51:56] because he tell me that did i check it
[51:58] out myself did you switch it out to
[52:00] yourself i'm unexplaining this i'm
[52:01] saying all them books and tapes is 50
[52:04] plus years people have time to figure
[52:05] out what a man preaching if he's off the
[52:06] water or not
[52:08] oh glory to god
[52:10] these are the churches as individuals
[52:12] each individual in the church and now
[52:14] it's got to our time here we go it's no
[52:16] secret we all see it
[52:18] when a man proves
[52:20] and god loves him
[52:22] he takes him out somewhere to himself
[52:26] dear
[52:27] in the front of angel he does something
[52:30] for him he lifts him up in the presence
[52:32] of god and gives him
[52:35] fills him
[52:37] and sets him out
[52:39] that's the age we are living in
[52:42] so we are living the age where god could
[52:44] pull a man aside give him
[52:47] fill him
[52:49] and set him out that is the age we are
[52:52] living in
[52:53] the same holy spirit
[52:54] that save the lutherans that sanctify
[52:57] the methodists that baptize the
[52:58] pentecostal is now settling in order the
[53:01] coming of the lord jesus when it will be
[53:04] so powerful this body will come into
[53:07] this group a church that will draw the
[53:09] rest of them from the grave there will
[53:11] be a resurrection that is what the holy
[53:14] ghost is for
[53:16] we in our intellectual cells we know
[53:18] what mess itself and our talking self
[53:20] can't bring the resurrection it will
[53:22] take god himself is the resurrection
[53:25] power is what brought lazarus from the
[53:27] greece he said i am the resurrection and
[53:30] the life here say no man is that i am
[53:32] the resurrection and the life he that
[53:34] believe it on me though he dead he shall
[53:36] live isn't that right where have you lay
[53:38] them roll away the stone lazarus come
[53:39] forth lazarus come forth we know what
[53:42] that voice was that was the voice of the
[53:44] archangel and that voice have to be in a
[53:46] bride we understand that that is the
[53:48] voice of power that's the voice
[53:49] authority not even the dead could stay
[53:51] dead when that voice had to speak oh
[53:53] glory to god and what happened christ
[53:55] does all three the shout the voice and
[53:58] the trump the dead in christ shall rise
[54:00] jesus does all three the shout is
[54:02] already done oh glory to god through
[54:04] malachi 4 will the bride be that voice
[54:06] hallelujah praise god then that same
[54:09] jesus going to come and usher through a
[54:11] bride hallelujah because this church has
[54:14] to come to perfection in order to bring

[58:45] you are sons and daughters and bahrain
[58:47] says if i could only with my human voice
[58:50] placed into your heart the importance
[58:53] of receiving the baptism of the holy
[58:55] ghost it will be the most wonderful
[58:58] revelation you ever had in your life
[59:00] you must do it then he talked about let
[59:03] me make it clear about you are not
[59:05] converted
[59:06] and to give that example you talk about
[59:09] peter and peter he had given power to
[59:12] against unclean spirits he was
[59:14] sanctified and jesus said before the
[59:16] court three times you deny me he said
[59:18] but i prayed for you and after you were
[59:20] converted then strengthen your brethren
[59:23] he had shouted he probably had danced in
[59:25] the spirit he had done all kind of
[59:27] things but he hadn't received the holy
[59:29] ghost yet he said after you are
[59:31] converted then strengthen your brethren
[59:34] that's true to carry out his plan go
[59:36] into all the world and preach the gospel
[59:38] isn't that right not word only but
[59:40] through power and demonstrating of the
[59:43] holy ghost making the word of god
[59:46] manifest is the gospel oh glowing up
[59:49] teachings and revelations and mysteries
[59:52] no that is a seed of the gospel but the
[59:54] gospel has taken the same word
[59:56] hallelujah and making it manifest oh
[1:00:00] glory to god what's the first thing we
[1:00:01] read men could take the scripture and
[1:00:03] make it live hallelujah waiting for
[1:00:05] somebody to anoint it and make it live
[1:00:08] that somebody is you who glory to god
[1:00:10] god call you with faith in your heart to
[1:00:12] anoint what is promised to you oh
[1:00:15] hallelujah so jesus knew hallelujah that
[1:00:18] there would be a great intellectual move
[1:00:20] just like there was in his days washing
[1:00:22] pots and pans and wearing of clothes and
[1:00:25] turn around colors he said wait a minute
[1:00:27] i am not going to leave you comfortless
[1:00:29] i'm going to come again to you the works
[1:00:31] that i do shall you do also oh glory to
[1:00:34] god not the talk that i talk but the
[1:00:37] works that i do shall you do also the
[1:00:40] purpose of sending the holy ghost was
[1:00:42] for god to continue to a bunch of people
[1:00:45] to continually manifest god to the world
[1:00:48] yes people believe when we share
[1:00:50] scriptures when we share the word and
[1:00:52] god open up the eyes god is operating
[1:00:54] all that too but god's purpose is to
[1:00:57] manifest himself to show he is god he
[1:01:00] has no hands but your hands you have no
[1:01:02] eyes but your eyes he has no mouth but
[1:01:04] your mouth step forward brethren he want
[1:01:07] to use you or give the lord a shout make
[1:01:09] yourself available to him hallelujah the
[1:01:12] purpose of selling the holy ghost was
[1:01:14] for the god to continue through a bunch
[1:01:16] of people to continually manifest god to
[1:01:19] the world that's exactly not by a creed
[1:01:22] not by denomination but by the power of
[1:01:24] his resurrection how by making his word
[1:01:27] real by taking his promise like what
[1:01:29] we're doing tonight and standing on the
[1:01:32] cider mind of the minority and believe
[1:01:34] in god and watch the black skies roll
[1:01:36] back and the power of god moving and
[1:01:39] take over that is what he wants that is
[1:01:42] what the holy ghost will stand for
[1:01:43] that's the purpose he sent it to stay on
[1:01:46] the side of the minority and that's what
[1:01:48] he said when the church has grown him
[1:01:50] hallelujah underhook the persecution of
[1:01:52] the outside world that the holy ghost is
[1:01:54] just as real as it was on the day of
[1:01:56] pentecost how they grown how they
[1:01:59] travail but when they are born
[1:02:01] unpositionally born then god sets in the
[1:02:03] church pastor teacher prophet evangelist
[1:02:05] let him fight that oh glory to god we
[1:02:07] have fighting that you know we believe
[1:02:09] the same holy ghost that peter had the
[1:02:11] same holy ghost that paul had the same
[1:02:13] holy ghost that the early church had we
[1:02:15] have to have that same holy ghost oh

[1:02:18] message that is the holy ghost oh glory
[1:02:20] to god when i believe i have the holy
[1:02:22] ghost that's a lie that's a baptist
[1:02:24] doctrine oh i am the holy ghost that's
[1:02:26] another lie there's a big lie for glory
[1:02:28] to god you have to receive it because he
[1:02:30] sent it oh hallelujah what's the holy
[1:02:34] ghost is for he's the purpose of the
[1:02:35] holy ghost that's what god sent the holy
[1:02:38] ghost for the power is to give you power

[1:04:44] fire hit him hallelujah something
[1:04:46] happened within him that transformed
[1:04:48] that man altogether he knew he had power

[1:05:08] dissolve and something going to break
[1:05:10] into your soul of a faith like you never

[1:05:14] raising jesus was putting on a hard
[1:05:16] sleep on the boat and when the disciples
[1:05:18] were singing these specials and they
[1:05:19] recognize it's not working it's still

[1:11:32] that was the captain message after all
[1:11:35] the mysteries after all the revelations
[1:11:38] after all the history the messages were
[1:11:40] capped off by this
[1:11:43] particular message the token and the
[1:11:45] token is not doctrine the token is not
[1:11:48] teaching the token is the blood on

[1:12:48] oh my
[1:12:49] oh hallelujah the law and the prophets
[1:12:51] were until john
[1:12:54] almost finished
[1:12:57] since that time
[1:12:59] the kingdom is preaching
[1:13:01] and every man presented he said every
[1:13:02] man present it not just simply walk into
[1:13:04] it easily
[1:13:06] it's got to be pressed into
[1:13:08] it's got to be
[1:13:09] pressed into say present to wherever you

[1:13:24] the kingdom you're passing of the
[1:13:25] kingdom
[1:13:26] he doesn't control the kingdom he
[1:13:27] doesn't have the kingdom
[1:13:29] you have to press into the kingdom
[1:13:31] of god hallelujah almost finished
[1:13:34] usually it takes a state of emergency to
[1:13:36] thrust into desperation
[1:13:38] it's too bad it has to do that but human
[1:13:40] beings are so slutful in their mind it
[1:13:42] takes emergency something arises and
[1:13:45] when they do it shows them into a
[1:13:47] desperation and really in doing that
[1:13:49] desperation it brings out the real thing
[1:13:51] that you are it shows
[1:13:53] what you are made up of
[1:13:55] hallelujah
[1:13:56] o praise the lord
[1:13:58] thank you lord in egypt time
[1:14:02] it was a real tough hour you know
[1:14:04] it was tough
[1:14:06] because you're hearing these screams
[1:14:08] young people calling people bawling
[1:14:10] night because that angel moving
[1:14:13] and hearing it coming from a distance
[1:14:15] and why you think about it now
[1:14:17] from a distance and you have crying
[1:14:19] going on
[1:14:20] a mother wailing because her son is dead
[1:14:22] in the house that angel just moved
[1:14:24] through
[1:14:25] and the prophet dramatized the children
[1:14:28] asking the father daddy are you sure
[1:14:31] are you sure we are safe i hear cries
[1:14:34] down the road and the cry is getting
[1:14:35] nearer and nearer that's a shaken time
[1:14:38] you can't eat
[1:14:39] you can't sleep
[1:14:41] that's a dreadful night
[1:14:43] actually that night they wasn't sleeping
[1:14:45] and rocking a child going to sleep i
[1:14:46] going to take us no no no they had the
[1:14:48] stuff in their hands
[1:14:50] shoes on their feet it wasn't free time
[1:14:52] you know it was time to move out i
[1:14:55] wonder if that time coming back again
[1:14:57] a desperate time
[1:14:58] time to leave this place
[1:15:00] time to leave this world i want to be
[1:15:02] coming back to that again hallelujah a
[1:15:04] midnight time a midnight cry or midnight
[1:15:07] oh
[1:15:08] people lay back in the message they're
[1:15:09] relaxing
[1:15:11] probably say yeah you're relaxing but
[1:15:12] then something's going to happen
[1:15:14] that changes everything
[1:15:16] oh my
[1:15:18] hallelujah it was a shaken time
[1:15:21] the daddy are you a short time
[1:15:23] you see when we have genuine love what
[1:15:25] does it do it pushes our feet out to the
[1:15:27] battlefront for god
[1:15:29] genuine godly love for god and for his
[1:15:32] word and for his people will push fate
[1:15:35] out dear love just takes a hold of fate
[1:15:38] that is why it's important to understand
[1:15:41] that this faith to put long charity is
[1:15:43] based upon forgiveness if we can love
[1:15:45] the brethren if we can't have genuine
[1:15:47] forgiveness and dropping out how could
[1:15:49] we access this presence and power and i
[1:15:52] was sharing how we need the lord we
[1:15:54] really need the lord
[1:15:57] all this coronavirus the kind of
[1:15:58] variants that respect and if any message
[1:16:00] you believe that books it will knock you
[1:16:02] out we'll kill you
[1:16:04] because it's a judgment that's what it
[1:16:06] really is it's debt
[1:16:08] are you following me now
[1:16:10] no we need the lord we need a spirit we
[1:16:12] need this power it is promise
[1:16:14] we cannot say send it no we want it no
[1:16:17] we would like to have it now we are not
[1:16:19] in charge of that like peter he was
[1:16:21] speaking but the holy ghost fell
[1:16:24] on them
[1:16:25] the word seed was going out and the
[1:16:27] spirit was here to water that seed and
[1:16:29] make the word spoken made manifest
[1:16:31] and put them into the kingdom of god
[1:16:33] swirl turn to spirit in their life they
[1:16:36] receive it spirit word
[1:16:38] into their hearts out of peter's mouth
[1:16:41] because peter is in the body so he's a
[1:16:43] dramatized son he's a channel of god
[1:16:46] hallelujah life is flowing through peter
[1:16:49] eternal life oh glory to god joey god's
[1:16:52] own life fire from of the altar oh glory
[1:16:56] to god the man even baptized in jesus
[1:16:58] name yet the man never went to one
[1:17:01] service the man i listened to one book
[1:17:03] one tape but he had testimony from a
[1:17:05] living witness i know dead scripture
[1:17:07] there's a living witness those black
[1:17:09] those brothers was written epistles
[1:17:11] hallelujah that was a living word
[1:17:13] talking to them that was a living word
[1:17:15] preaching to cornelius house the text of
[1:17:17] what peter was preaching wasn't written
[1:17:19] yet he was living it out hallelujah and
[1:17:22] the devil had to move out oh glory to
[1:17:24] god this is wonderful tonight hallelujah
[1:17:27] but i'm saying god will always meet a
[1:17:29] desperate soul
[1:17:30] he says usually it takes something to
[1:17:32] drive us into that to that despair to
[1:17:35] that desperation it takes something to
[1:17:37] do it james 5 15 the effectual favor and
[1:17:40] the prayer of a righteous man of that
[1:17:42] much the effectual favored prayer he
[1:17:45] said that his desperation was
[1:17:46] desperation effectual food and prayer
[1:17:48] it's similar to he that committed god
[1:17:50] must believe that he is he's a reward of
[1:17:52] them that diligently energetically
[1:17:54] fervently seek him so there's a way to
[1:17:56] see god father i love you lord and you
[1:17:59] know how it is no i know i know
[1:18:01] desperation they just talk like that
[1:18:03] trinidad hiding under the breath of
[1:18:05] prayer we're not talking about that kind
[1:18:06] of thing you know when you're desperate
[1:18:09] it reflects in your action your attitude
[1:18:11] it reflects in your desires and
[1:18:12] everything else oh glory to god the
[1:18:14] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:18:16] man fulfilled prayer
[1:18:19] oh praise god as in the bible teaching
[1:18:21] when i elijah elisha didn't know what
[1:18:24] was wrong with the child god didn't tell
[1:18:26] him everything he said a piece of flow
[1:18:28] he's had to paste the flow started he's
[1:18:29] what happened he's desperation he won't
[1:18:31] know happening the child fall dead this
[1:18:33] can't work i give the woman a promise
[1:18:35] and this can't help me and hallelujah
[1:18:37] they put a child in the room again
[1:18:38] desperate hallelujah based on the flow
[1:18:40] but i'm saying peace on the floor why
[1:18:42] something moving in he said lord is your
[1:18:44] will your god if you beat your will lord
[1:18:47] um if the child lives while he's living
[1:18:49] die die you bury him no it wasn't that
[1:18:52] wasn't it that way we have no lord if
[1:18:54] it's your will and people just accept
[1:18:56] the condition accept the diabetes accept
[1:18:58] cancer accept tumor accept whatever they
[1:19:01] want to accept because
[1:19:02] if god before us we are the miracles
[1:19:05] hallelujah where's the desperation to
[1:19:07] see the miracle
[1:19:08] no if we don't say this people don't
[1:19:09] preach that people wouldn't expect
[1:19:10] miracles they expect to be dead and
[1:19:12] buried
[1:19:13] they expect to sick and die
[1:19:15] where are the miracles have got before
[1:19:17] us oh glory to god hallelujah

[1:20:21] that place until the whole church here
[1:20:23] we go
[1:20:25] until
[1:20:26] the whole church gets to a place that is
[1:20:28] between life and death
[1:20:30] then you you have to have it no or
[1:20:32] perish then god will move on the scene
[1:20:35] it takes desperation to bring god on the
[1:20:38] scene we know jacob got desperate and
[1:20:40] then jesus pulling on and so on and some
[1:20:43] people say i see a light he said glory

[1:20:57] there until something happened that make
[1:21:00] him walk different made him a different
[1:21:03] person because he stayed until something

[1:21:10] message you'll find i will be beating
[1:21:11] that and i will keep beating it until
[1:21:13] it's strike home not until you hear
[1:21:15] another sermon we are people who sit and
[1:21:18] hear someone and say amen and they live
[1:21:20] they live in rotten they are terrible
[1:21:22] people terror behave
[1:21:25] but they're doing a duty amen him and
[1:21:27] that every word nothing unto them
[1:21:31] nothing up to them they are amenals of
[1:21:33] wood

[1:21:44] here now
[1:21:45] jacob stayed here until something
[1:21:47] happened that made him walk different
[1:21:49] made him different person because he
[1:21:51] stayed until that happened
[1:21:53] the bible said he held until he
[1:21:55] prevailed how can a man prevail over god
[1:21:58] but you can do it you can do it a man
[1:22:00] can prevail over god but you can't be
[1:22:03] desperate till god speaks to you
[1:22:05] so you have to hear direct from god he
[1:22:07] said oh church right shake yourself
[1:22:09] pinch your conscience wake yourself up
[1:22:11] in this hour we must be desperate or
[1:22:13] perish there is coming forth something
[1:22:15] from the lord i know it has thus said
[1:22:16] the lord there is coming forth something
[1:22:18] and we better be desperate is between
[1:22:20] life and death it will pass through us
[1:22:22] and we won't see it a blind bartimaeus
[1:22:25] when he cried out to jesus they telling
[1:22:27] me making shut up it made too much
[1:22:29] annoyance but he was desperate and he
[1:22:31] what he do he screamed out
[1:22:33] he said oh jesus no matter they told him
[1:22:35] to stop he cried out just the same that
[1:22:38] more louder when they told him to shut
[1:22:40] up it made him get louder because he was
[1:22:42] desperate
[1:22:43] nobody could stop him he said lord
[1:22:45] have mercy upon me
[1:22:47] that was enough oh glory to god
[1:22:49] hallelujah and christ left what he was
[1:22:52] doing to minister to him because god
[1:22:54] always responds to a desperate soul
[1:22:56] mission comma please desperation calls
[1:22:59] for a subject and when the subject no
[1:23:01] matter how faint it is it's received it
[1:23:04] is believed right there
[1:23:05] oh my peter we know peter he fell in the
[1:23:08] water and so on and he said christian
[1:23:11] tonight if you're in the line of duty
[1:23:12] trying to follow the leading of the holy
[1:23:14] spirit and a cancer grab you that grabs
[1:23:17] you a cancer tuba color
[1:23:19] whatever it is he said scream out and
[1:23:22] said lord save me
[1:23:23] hallelujah god heard him in the line of
[1:23:26] duty he started to sink he failed no
[1:23:28] matter if you feel
[1:23:30] that don't have nothing to do with it i
[1:23:32] think i would read it again
[1:23:35] god heard him
[1:23:37] he said in the line of duty he started
[1:23:39] to sink
[1:23:40] he failed
[1:23:41] no matter if you fail
[1:23:43] that
[1:23:44] don't have
[1:23:46] nothing to do with it we all feel
[1:23:49] we are fair to begin with but we got
[1:23:52] somebody standing now with a strong hand
[1:23:54] who can reach us and take us above the
[1:23:56] water and if you make a mistake
[1:23:58] some women make a mistake some man made
[1:24:01] a mistake some boy or girl made a
[1:24:03] mistake don't sink
[1:24:05] scream out and despair lord save me or
[1:24:08] i'll perish
[1:24:09] get desperate about it god will hear you
[1:24:12] he always hears a desperate soul
[1:24:16] oh my
[1:24:17] and jesus
[1:24:18] is humility he said not my will but i'll
[1:24:21] be done
[1:24:22] he prayed earnestly he said brother
[1:24:24] sister if jesus hurt prayerlessly how
[1:24:26] much more have we got to pray earnestly
[1:24:28] if god of heaven made flesh had to pray
[1:24:31] earnestly then how much more we are
[1:24:33] sinners saved by grace so where are we
[1:24:35] putting all the arrogance that we see in
[1:24:37] this message
[1:24:38] all the hostile behavior all the proud
[1:24:41] and and so on like that and people
[1:24:43] believe
[1:24:44] that because they have a book or table
[1:24:46] believe this message that everything is
[1:24:48] fine they just made it already they are
[1:24:51] deceived they will receive them
[1:24:52] fully deceived
[1:24:54] they fail to understand
[1:24:56] that those two million people that came
[1:24:58] out of egypt wasn't going to make it to
[1:25:00] the promised land
[1:25:02] yeah
[1:25:03] yeah
[1:25:04] two million people come out under moses
[1:25:07] tapes books and tapes and moses message
[1:25:09] they all say we go in hallelujah they're
[1:25:11] going to the red sea hallelujah
[1:25:13] but they couldn't see the carcass fall
[1:25:15] in the wilderness they couldn't see the
[1:25:17] time
[1:25:18] begin to unfold and reveal the unbelief
[1:25:20] in their system they couldn't see the
[1:25:22] god that sees the end from the beginning
[1:25:24] saw the next generation moving in
[1:25:27] they couldn't see their children is who
[1:25:29] going to cross over with joshua and
[1:25:30] caleb they couldn't see that
[1:25:32] their attitudes and their mindset was so
[1:25:34] difficult and tough that god said you
[1:25:36] know what not one of them going over the
[1:25:38] children will go over
[1:25:40] the children will cross over
[1:25:42] hallelujah is god reserved
[1:25:45] i think the last message we preach on
[1:25:47] talk about ezekiel 9
[1:25:49] about the income writer
[1:25:52] and you know what the bible says
[1:25:54] start
[1:25:56] in my sanctuary
[1:25:58] and then they begin at the ancient men
[1:26:00] before the house
[1:26:02] before destruction struck the city
[1:26:05] before destruction strike los angeles
[1:26:08] before destruction strikes the world
[1:26:10] he will start in his house
[1:26:12] to the very people who claim to believe
[1:26:14] him love him and serve him
[1:26:16] he said begin at my sanctuary
[1:26:19] judgment actually begins right there and
[1:26:22] from there it goes out
[1:26:24] begin
[1:26:25] at my sanctuary this is not a game
[1:26:29] this message is not a plea thing this is
[1:26:32] the word from the lord and the word of
[1:26:34] the lord came unto me saying oh glory to
[1:26:36] god when that word come that word can
[1:26:38] fail because that word is god
[1:26:40] oh hallelujah
[1:26:43] thank you jesus
[1:26:45] but abraham says
[1:26:46] the people had their own camp
[1:26:48] but they had to change the cam grounds
[1:26:50] in order to see the supernatural
[1:26:53] when god deal with the people for many
[1:26:54] years god is not in the camp anymore
[1:26:57] because they made themselves a self-made
[1:26:59] camp
[1:27:00] not god's camp of his word a camp of
[1:27:02] their own he had to leave them for he is
[1:27:05] the word and he cannot stay where people
[1:27:08] are taught out of the word
[1:27:10] every group
[1:27:11] that off the word god can't stay there
[1:27:15] yes they're acknowledging this and god
[1:27:16] prophet he move out already because god
[1:27:18] and the word is the same that's why he
[1:27:20] says say what the tapes say
[1:27:22] don't say with no cuckoo revelation no
[1:27:24] new revelation some revelation the
[1:27:25] prophet did not bring and is sung in
[1:27:27] good but it's not the scriptures it can
[1:27:29] match all from genesis to revelation
[1:27:32] hallelujah so i prefer to stay with this
[1:27:34] hallelujah who vex lost
[1:27:36] glory to god i'm gonna close
[1:27:40] if you are not in the kingdom of god
[1:27:43] press into it surely i would have
[1:27:45] knowledge of what i'm speaking of god
[1:27:47] would never honor my prayer to do what
[1:27:49] he does and you're outside the kingdom
[1:27:51] see christ as your refuge now
[1:27:54] oh my
[1:27:56] you say man press into it you don't just
[1:27:58] turn around and say pick me up by the
[1:27:59] color lord push me in you press into it
[1:28:03] you get desperate between life and death
[1:28:05] oh my you begin to play something i'm
[1:28:07] done tonight and this is what i
[1:28:10] had to share with you tonight
[1:28:12] oh glory to god the purpose that god
[1:28:14] sent
[1:28:15] the holy ghost he says he's waiting for
[1:28:16] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:28:19] when god will make himself known
[1:28:22] oh my for 50 years god has made himself
[1:28:24] known by scriptures by text by
[1:28:26] revelation by the word since the prophet
[1:28:28] have left
[1:28:29] but we're talking about
[1:28:31] waiting
[1:28:33] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:28:36] when god will make himself known
[1:28:38] when they will stop sickness
[1:28:41] they will stop cancer
[1:28:43] they will stop diseases you think can
[1:28:45] say something
[1:28:46] the bible said there will come a time
[1:28:48] when men will rot right in their flesh
[1:28:51] and the buzzers will eat off the
[1:28:53] carcasses before they even die cancer is
[1:28:56] a two take to what's coming but remember
[1:28:58] that horrible thing was forbidden in
[1:29:00] that day
[1:29:01] to touch those who are the seed of god
[1:29:03] that's what we are striving for now
[1:29:06] to get in
[1:29:07] and be positionally placed into the
[1:29:09] kingdom of god
[1:29:11] before these horrible plagues strike
[1:29:13] conor virus
[1:29:15] that's not the end
[1:29:16] is somehow plague's coming
[1:29:18] it has worse coming
[1:29:20] that is just a tip of the iceberg
[1:29:22] that the lord could show what he can do
[1:29:25] what he can allow what he can permit
[1:29:27] what he can show
[1:29:29] to man with all his intelligence and all
[1:29:31] his science and all the technology
[1:29:33] he can show that something that your
[1:29:35] eyes can't see
[1:29:37] hallelujah is affecting people affecting
[1:29:40] lies
[1:29:42] and all along you're seeing masks
[1:29:44] all over the world
[1:29:45] because people don't want to get this
[1:29:47] virus since he says
[1:29:49] oh glory to god but there is another
[1:29:53] there's a inoculation of the holy ghost
[1:29:56] that god wants to give
[1:29:58] oh to whosoever will who wants it who
