here and the church here London Christian Assembly we are so grateful to be here greetings from The Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad and uh we just want to go straight in the word tonight Romans 8 we're want to read verse 28-31 and then you're going to have your seats Romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are de called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us may God bless his word tonight you may be seated have a context scripture from Esther chapter 4 and it's reading from verse 11 es chapter 4 and it says all the king servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come into the king into the inner Court who is not called there's one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come into the king these 30 days this is Esther sending back a report to morai that she she can't go and the King hasn't called her and they told to morai Esther's words then Mori commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed but who knew it whether thou had come to the kingdom for such a time as this then Esther B them return Mori this answer go gather all the Jews that are present in shushan and fasty for me and neither eat nor drink three days and night or day I also my maidens will Fast likewise and I will go in unto the king amen which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish oh blessed be the name of the Lord so tonight I have a title elected called anointed to rep placed for such a time as this amen elected called anointed to be placed for such a time as this have an inspiration if God before us who can be against us oh blessed be the name of the Lord so all the Believers in Hebrews 11 they obtain a good report through faith they receive not the promise God providing something better for us hallelujah isn't that right then he said this church has got to come to Perfection and when and and then that's when Christ does come so Christ is not coming if there's no Perfection and it takes Perfection to beun the resurrection amen so make no mistakes about it it's not joining Church no sir it's not sitting down in church it's coming to Perfection so the prophet said the church in the minority has got to get into a place until this same kind of a Ministry that this left because when a headstone come it got to be honed so he's not talking about church members now he's talking about fitting something holding all the rest of the stones in the pyramid Lan so perfect you could hardly run a raise way through them and when the pyramid cap does come not not if it will come when it comes the body of Christ would have to be honed Hallelujah so you can't dress yourself you you you have to be cut to fit this thing amen you have to be willing to be cut that's right you have to want to be cut Hallelujah we accustom going to church we not talking about going to church we talking about being ConEd fitted Hallelujah cut yes sir watch watch up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid said the body of Christ will have to be horned not only through some Creed or doctrine when we come true it will have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that Ministry or it have to have a that ministry here yes Christ come and have to meet the ministry of Jesus Christ in the church so the prophecy is that ministry will be among the bride that's right not to no the ministry of Jesus Christ his ministry has to be here among us hallelujah we have something to live for Hallelujah don't die yet we have something to live for don't give up yet we have something to live for don't backslide yet we have something to press on for oh because one thing God cannot do there are certain things God can't do he can't lie Hallelujah one thing he cannot do he can't lie whatever he says they going to come to pass whatever he said is true Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise God so they sleeping bride cannot come to Perfection because True Perfection is when we stand in the glorified state so the bride who have died on before they don't have their glorified bodies no sir they body in some box or somewhere and hole in the ground somewhere so they have gone on and we have to go and meet our tanes they have to pick up their bodies amen glorified State and that is perfection he redeem your soul he redeem your spirit then he redeem your body Oh Glory to God hallelujah there's no crippers over there you know there's no blind over there you know there's no old people over there you know there's no bald head over there you know there's no sickness over there you know there is no gray hair over there you know oh glory to God we're going back to Eden Oh Glory you don't belong to England you don't belong to London you're going back to Eden Oh Glory we here passing through to give a testimony that's right a glorious testimony of Our Redeemer amen oh pra is God so you have to stand perfected we have to stand a perfect man on the earth just waiting for this body to be changed that's right perfect in your soul Perfect by seven perfect spirits and all remaining is your body to be changed Oh Glory to God but say the church will come through justification sanctification B Holy Ghost until unto the Perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the self same person that's right here we go God will be manifested into his bride there not you trying something God will be so manifested in the bride Hallelujah so the prophet said when a man is born he becomes a spirit baby in Christ and when this Rob of flesh is dropped there's a natural body a theophany not made with hands that we go to and then that body returns back to pick up the glorified body so all the Sleeping Saints they don't have their glorified body no they have to come back to pick it up yes sir now watch Corinthians said if this Earthly Tac could be dissolved we have won another one so we have bypassed that to come straight from God to attribute to flesh purpose to be tempted that's right so tempted is a normal thing for believers that's what we sent here for we were sent here to overcome and the only way to overcome a test have to be given amen that we could prove to Satan we are not like Eve we don't have the given Hallelujah don't have the given Hallelujah you could stand Hallelujah glory to God say Amen you could stand you could stand you could stand what you're going through before you went through it God set it up for you he want to prove something to the devil my people would stand regardless Hallelujah glory to God so watch he this part so we pass our theophany and come to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did here we go when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word that we skipped to come right down here that's right oh Hallelujah to be tempted and tested and if we come through that because Jesus know all things because he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word here right on earth now we are formed to the word image preaching amen listen closely the books the tapes the messages the quotes are material this building was once sand and cement and Bricks but it has been formed into this building called a church that's right amen God is come to Bricks no and sand and cement he's coming something form so the material of the word of faith and virtue and knowledge that material but has to be formed and the trials and testings is what formed these things in you and I sir so here we have to be formed into the word image Hallelujah not your father image not your mother image not your image His Image so the image of God has to be presented to you and has been presented to you by the word oh we get in somewhere bear with me Hallelujah so you bypass your off the word so you came from thought to flesh hallelujah hallelujah here we are formed to the word image to be are partaker of the word to feed on the word and by being predestinated since the beginning you see that spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you remembered it you join this church or join that church nothing satisfied but then you recognize when the very word was Eagle food it wasn't you you know something in you that's right pull you to this message isn't that right that's right and watch he said now watch you said brother Bram therefore the theophany if you died and entered into that theophany what happens the theophany comes to the Earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you're in the air you take the body to meet your theop caught up to meet the Lord in the air now no man here go can come to me except the Father which sent me draw him and I will raise him in the last days so you didn't come to Jesus no he draw you let me say it again we getting somewhere tonight you didn't just come to the Lord and you want to get baptized in Jesus name no something pull you he said no man no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him oh glory to godall so watch this no other man can do it no other person no matter how good you are is got to be revealed to you then you see who christes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so watch here's the predestination plan in plain view just as other seed the word of God is a seed must have the ground prepared beforehand that's right ground prepared beforehand that's your heart hallu here we go if you saw a SE just threw it in the ground it would do no good watch this God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world take that devil he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age I challenge want you to believe that [Music] tonight Hallelujah this is not trying something this is understanding what God is saying he prepared your heart that's right before the foundation of the world to receive this enti message he fornew You by his forn knowledge and ordain you to eternal life he knew you then he therefore he prepared you [Music] Hallelujah that's the reason you stagger out of these things and stagger into what you have now that means you have been elected what the scripture read who he for you hallu he called are you called yes did he call you well the calling upon your life is evidence that he forew you or he knew you before now in the beginning was the word the word was with God Satan came in the beginning but you were before the beginning that's where he forn you oh glory to God so he's not scratching his head wondering if you're going to make it or if you're going to come true he knew you will make it that's why he put you in the heat that you're in he knew you would come true that's why he could put the test upon you you are going to make it you have to make it you got to make it God has elected you [Music] Hallelujah before he could call you he had to elect you before you become the word you have to be a thought because the word is a thought expressed so before God speak it you have to think it and he was thinking about you and he spoke you by his word when the word is preached there was something turning inside of you that's God that's right preaching Hallelujah Glory may be seated Jo had no bible to read he went by inspiration and then he go speak by inspiration and he said that's the church when it's in order it's got the mechanics ready it only need the Dynamics if you will get the mechanics ready you know what he says get our hearts right amen the things that we can do exactly so we cannot just say because I believe the message no I'm in the Raptor I'm in the bride no no no no no that's not way that the same as saying I have bricks I have cement I have sand I have a building no no no no no you have to you have to you got to get somebody to mix the water and mix the cement and mix the stand and lay the bricks you have to do all that it have something called process hallelujah hallelujah that's why it's stated this way who he found who he called we call he justified we Justified he has already glorified no it is God that ify it so that justification part only God could do that that's the part that God Alone could do it is God that bringing glory glorify it only God could do that there is something missing between we talk about that later oh praise the name of the Lord let's go so what tonight if you could get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow every what he can do get the mechanic ready so if you know you're not following instruction in this church if you know you're not doing all that you can do you wouldn't have full faith that's right that's right if you're not praying supporting and doing all that you can do you know you're short so you sit in church but you're not fully there you're not doing all that you can do watch and watch follow me in every order get the mechanics ready and stand there then we are ready for Dynamics and only God can do that that's to drop into your heart that faith that says I am now healed that's Dynamics that's right Hallelujah something Dro you know it's over you could have a tumor a cancer one disease tonight and it could be over tonight right because God dropped the faith in your heart over exactly Hallelujah a woman came up to brother Brandon with crutches she was seen all the discernment or I she came up on the platform she hand him the crutches and walk off that's right he didn't have to pray for her and she didn't have to tell him anything by the time she reached on the platform she was so anointed that she hand him the crutches and walk back [Music] home oh glory to God Jesus never said my power heal you he said thy fith made the whole Oh Glory to God all right let's go Jesus came for one specific purpose yes sir to redeem those who God for you amen that's right Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for H Hazard thought I'll die up there maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved no no no no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus come for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that God fornew would be redeemed amen amen [Music] hallelujah therefore God being God before the foundation of the world knew who would be saved and who would not so he could say Jacob I love is so I hate because he's coming for that church right that's right and that church how do you get into the church by one spirit amen and the church is going to be there whether you are in it or I am in it it will appear before God without spot or wrinkle why because God can't lie impossible I don't care how much people walk out this message God can't lie there will be a bride of Jesus Christ in this message right Hallelujah glory to God you cannot tell me that the sodomites will take over no bride you cannot tell me that the Beast system will take over no bride you cannot tell me the Antichrist system will take over no bride not when Daniel saw a stone cut out without the hands of man Hallelujah that Stone is coming that stone is a Capstone that stone is your capping Stone Oh Glory to God hallelujah but says he never said in this church will be William Bram he said the church would be dear she would be a glorious Church washed in the blood of the land iron out without spot or wrinkle Oh Glory to God so when God take your dirty clothes like you went on in your washing machine and and put the clothes in your washing machine and so agitate like that rock like that to get all the dirt out of it and afterwards God take you out and rest you on the table and hit the iron wo too hot no without wrinkle and he put the heat on you now and he going to iron you out first he wash in the [Music] tub hallelujah hallelujah the wash is not enough it have fire to come it have heat to come it have iron smooth you out so be B stop complaining hallelujah hallelujah stop complaining right come on now we have to be stronger than this you know for what lays ahead Oh Glory to God and we have a word tonight if God before us who can be against us we know the accuser of the Brethren accusing day and night but we have a word from the Lord if God before us who can be against us Oh Glory to God when you being accused of don't accuse one another you know you are not Satan Satan accused the bedro Hallelujah and when Satan is accusing Jesus said I died for them I pay the price for them I have redeemed them I have forgiven them what you're talking about about oh give the Lord some shouts in the house glory to God we were born in sin we were shap iniquity but we will not stay in sin we not going to stay in iniquity oh give the Lord some Praises we were born in it but we're not going to stay it you're going to come out you're going to get out Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Lord now some people say now so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him good question that's right but that's up to you ahuh right you got to do something too that's right they that overcome shall inherit all things you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down that's right the Bible say she has made herself ready listen this God could not push us through a pipe and pull us on the other side and say blessed is he that overcome it sir so listen friends you know that people as you pass pass pass as as you God have as is you no oh you can pass nobody looking God doesn't have that J the word is God and his love and Justice he can't betray hallu I think about that yes sir do you note how when Israel sinned how God judged them he said I will shut up your Heavens I will send famine and pestilence that's right I will send the king of Babylon to take into captivity exactly because God have to ear his word that's right now remember you are not God hallelujah and God is outside of this dimension in that sense looking in at us as humans that's right he can't help but release his word amen when he came down on the mountain on M SI and fire start to rock the building rock the mountain they said don't let God speak let Moses speak and God wrapped the fire and Thunders and voices into a man and Moses spoke and that's why you get man Shing by better alone but by every word that proceed the M of God so that's why God have to honor his word yes sir doesn't matter preacher Deacon Elder Deacon children preacher children Pastor TR doesn't matter he's no respector of persons he has to honor his word that's right if you believe it and receive it he going to bless you if you stay with it your cup going to run over the devil can't do nothing about it he said he prepared a table for me in the presence of my [Music] enemies is one thing to get a table you know that's right but when God had to prepared in front your enemy your enemy seeing the table come the enemy see tablecloth come on top the table the enemy see the spoon and the fork and the T that that slow motion touch him oh glory to God hallelujah he prepared a table for me not all instantly you know they seen your hand the hand of God upon you they seeing your blessing upon you you know what it is that's the anointing glory to God hallelujah so first you must be elected then you have to be called then you have to be anointed Oh Glory to God and then you're going to be placed oh give the Lord a shout tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God so if you know you are elected then God call you it's a confidence is a confirmation you have been elected then the next you have to be anointed that's right holy ghost must come upon you something Supernatural must strike you if you never Struck it striking you tonight it will strike it sometime but it got to strike you as a son you got to get it you got to get it you see how God told Samuel anoint one of the sons of Jesse and he couldn't find anybody else you say have to have somebody else and he s for David and David come and they put the whole oil upon David David clueless hallelujah what that is about because he just stumbled there and Sam was so excited oh gosh this is the man in the presence of the brethen anointed and what David did I'm King now he lost his head if you say that that's right that talk he's not ready yet for kingship he's not ready yet for the position no sir he don't have the character yet to get there exactly but he's anointed what to David he is elected he is called now he's anointed now he's ready for process how to get into position oh give the Lord a shout the kingdom of God is preach and Every Man Press their way say press shout out press every man what every man what press their way into Give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God so the pastor here can't push you into it you have to press that's right the kingdom of God is preach and every man present it Hallelujah God could not push us through a pipe pull us out on the other end and say blessed is he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just push you through but you have got decisions to make for your myself that's right I have to make decision for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God oh glory to God Abraham was promised a child but he was maintained This Promise for 25 years the ups and downs do you have ups and downs I doo we should use hard too of course about it ups and downs sir and he had Temptations in those 25 years but he held on to the Word of Promise yes sir God never tells SAR would go talk to Abraham Abraham had Revelation so he had to believe for himself and his wife that's right when his when he tell his wife about baby and what not she may be cook for him for two days but that doesn't make any sense it's not fitting what I'm seeing for myself but he had to believe for her for himself if he get frustrated with his wife in trouble because he can't divorce and put away because it's true Sarah that this miracle going to happen so you can't get a new wife you know because God already said to Sarah and God can't lie if God say Sarah Sarah if God say you it's going to be you the Lord I shout in the house did you get it tonight if God says Sarah it's Sarah Sarah can laugh how much you want to laugh laugh it's still Sarah Sarah could cry Sarah could stop cooking it doesn't matter it going to be Sarah anyhow and I tell you whatever you going through is still going to be you but I have no time to replace you oh give the Lord a sh feeling good tonight glory to God God is getting nobody to replace you Hallelujah brother Bram Israel was promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it that's right amen this is part of the proc says yes sir I'm the bride prove it you're the bride show it you're the bride live it show me you are the bride if you sit on day Church remember anybody could do that you're watching yeah I do you watch I you act upon what you're hearing amen put your hand inside of it that's right get dirty Hallelujah there's a scripture where where there's no Ox his stable is clean but where there's Ox there's increase that's right so I was telling you Pastor once they have mess around that's good it mean there's a ox in the building there's work going on everything SP and span and clean oh you have no be of burden to help you out and take it through my God God want to see work you want to see activity for this kingdom yes sir but listen to what baram says wherever The Souls of your feet tread upon that have I given to you God told her to Joshua so if Joshua standing still matching we are matching over Jerusalem and right matching to Jerusalem you standing still matching God want you to get somewhere put your foot on things put your foot in God put your foot in prayer put your foot in Praise You never stand up before and give God praise somebody stand up and you watching them you never stand before try standing up try holding up both hands up in the air try waving spin around a little bit do [Music] something those lepers they say if we stay we'll die you know the lepers people staring inside there lepers is something else you don't want to go close to them them fell sit down and figure it out that's the most intellectual that the lowest level of faith that reasoning behind faith if we stay we die go so it'll kill us we know you know what going on so everybody let me go so in enemy camp and because of their faith in making a

as sons that never fell never [Music] fell we going back to original let us make man in all amen in our likeness let that man have dominion God is burdened to bring the image back because once the image come back Dominion come back power come back reflection of God come back Perfection is back once the image is restored so the prophet brought the image [Music] back Adam had the book Adam lost the book brother Adam got the book because Jesus died to pay the price to get the book to call your [Music] name that's what the book is about is that seals and church ages no it's your name your name

he said come follow me and Peter something about Jesus he just had to follow what happened there he was elected that's right now Jesus come and call him Hallelujah so once you're elected Hallelujah he has to call you Hallelujah note I am not dealing with what you have done or what you doing right now no that is negative or contrary to his will or his plan I'm not talking about that we could talk about that you know but I'm not talking about that tonight Hallelujah I'm stealing solely at the level of what God has predestinated and ordained and if you see what I'm seeing you would come out your foolishness you will come out pornography fil whatever it is whatever you doing that is off the word you will come out of it why because you have a higher calling come on come on pre back to me because you have a higher calling sin and all that contrary Behavior hold you back hold you down it could delay your blessing it can't stop it it could delay it you can't be denied but it can be delayed or give the Lord a shout in the house come on preach back to me somebody Hallelujah you can't be denied Hallelujah I told them in Ivory Coast you may be SE like when I come to London here at the past through immigration Europeans and londoners and and English people have to pass through their own stuff and what like you are English person or you have your passport or residence or they cany you because you have you belong here you're born here or grow up here become a c here so when you come through that don't let you pass I who don't belong here they could say no yeah I don't want you to come here get up so when you become a citizen of the Kingdom No Angel could stop you at the gate and say you can't come here right I'm not an angel you know I'm a son it have my father is the king you know right oh give the Lord some Praises so the gospel come to bring us into citizenship of the Kingdom this Kingdom have rules and laws isn't that right so you are The Virtuous sinless bride isn't that right you are perfect that's how God see you are standing completely you never sin in the first place God God don't even know I'm reading it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you are accused of it but from the beginning you are predestinated to be a son and daughter of God not a sinner son not a sinner daughter son son daughter daughter Hallelujah your old book of divorcement is put away it is dead that's right this a big one absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God back home we have the Caribbean Sea you don't have a SE of forgetfulness that's why you remember what I done you remember what this one done even though you forgive them you remember what everybody done but God have a SE call the see of forgetfulness when he put it in there he and all can remember Hallelujah we are too small Hallelujah to have a sea of forgetfulness God have that when he drop your sins in the sea of forgetfulness and go a sign no fish in here and the devil put on his thing and trying to fish out fish out fish out tell the devil go back before the cross go back before the beginning tell the devil don't stop last year and year before let's go back and we could go back where he wasn't even before he only came in the beginning but you going back to your election and your predestination Hallelujah my God my God my God I'm going skip some things here now Hallelujah glory to God let's go David was called by election he was elected he was called he was anointed and he was placed right let's go you are not a Christian by your desire you are not a Christian by your desire you are Christian by God's [Applause] desire Oh Glory to God no man can come to me except the father join ver number one first thing you were elected called when God elected you then he called you you heed his call and he pour the anointing oil upon you which is the Holy Ghost glory to God notice when the anointing struck David he was positionally placed as king but because David had to go to process now he's anointed that's right God see him as king but he can't go R the throne and sit down he will get killed that's right that another king there right now I said the same day they get anointed a evil spirit come on Soul what for in the Old Testament nobody us to cast out Devils but music could run the Devils off so devil upon sa and they say Bo we need somebody to bring music you know who could make music David stand for David Prett H yes sir and the H that's going to be him and the H that's going to be his that's right all right am so watch I'll skip all right wonderful David before before anything ever happened before he ever had the anointing all in him he knew God is with him that's right then you all come upon him oh my let me skip down here now when we take God's word we got in seed form that's right we can accept Divine Healing so when he when he says though you have a you want to get a oak tree he give you an acorn he give you a seed want you want a redeemer Behold a virgin shall conceive look a baby that's right you want a promise God give you a seed the seed is not to just be a seed the seed is the plant that's right then is he going to grow so God give you something to work with that's right and then you can see the growth in your life then you can mature and ripen so you don't have to be impatient you don't have to be frustrated with God and yourself the one who started a good work in you will complete it in you he's able to fulfill it praise the name of the Lord so if God hadn't elected to be a Christian you would not be a Christian it is God Choice it is God's choice not yours amen when God called you this is the word now it showed he elected you amen you accepted the call it was justification oh praise God so God watch this God's spirit is here and His Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe it amen if Jesus Christ rub of everything he had Jesus Christ rubed Satan of everything he had he spoiled principalities Powers dominions his domain Reigns over the heavens and earth and we are subject to his domain and he said you Davids you are called You're elected anointed positionally placed put into the body of Christ by the Bap of Holy Ghost Goliath you are defeated oh my all right let me see if I can just I skip a lot of stuff see we can TI up this here now to wrap up this thing now whom we for know he called predestinated and who he called he also Justified whom he justified glorified what was missing in that verse what was missing that part inside of there justification passed glorification is to come what's in between sanctification glory god is in other words that's the part you have to play that's right that's the part you have to do amen that sanctification part sir all right so let's look at Esther Hallelujah who was selected that's right elected to replace a feminist woman rights head vast that's right amen who refused to respond to the king's calling she didn't want to respond to her headship that's right the onetime Arrogant bride exactly of the king entitled woman just like the message will is today that's right the king rejected her and sought another exactly we know the story listen to this carefully yes sir this one is from the UN song but brandham says he can provide himself a church he don't have to have me he don't have to have you that's right somebody else can take your place that's true be careful exactly some don't take your crown don't forget that tonight because vasy thought she had it allly she can make Style on the king king said get rid of that woman that's right let me get somebody else Hallelujah so if the arrogance of people in this message God will flush them out and bring new people in and take them to be the bride so don't sit down comfortably in your seat thinking you can't be replaced you can Glory Moni yes sir elected selected Esther Hallelujah she received things from for purification Esther did Esther couldn't reveal who she was that's right because Mori told her not to do iten keep still Esther yes sir don't go and pronounce and say this and say that she was elected she is called Hallelujah she's anointed she found favor with the king the king rest the crown on her head no power yet that's right no Authority yet not yet like David who was anointed The King The King anointed was upon him right but he wasn't ready for the position EXA by what he was anointed Hallelujah glory to God so we know the story sir God always have somebody in position to tell your secrets so Mori got information that two guys want to know how King he reported to Esther tell the king and and hman get promotion that's right all right he was the agite and he was above everybody else that's and the all the king servants that were in the king's gate this verse two of chapter three of Esther reverence hmon for the king had so commanded considering him but Mori bowed not never not did that reverence so he man find that morai wasn't reverencing his ministry he wanted modai to Bow because morai him and F he had a bigger Ministry being placed by the king and promoted by the king verse five saids when hmon saw that modai bowed not not didn't reference him he was full of rra so he g a fight with this one guy and that fight put in his heart to kill the people of that guy the Jews there go so then we he talked to the king instructions so kill all them Jews among them and so like that hmon is now anointed and placed and placed to fight the elect sent out pamphlets letters to destroy and kill God's people when Mori perceive all was done he went dis closed sacot and Ashes that's right and then Esther call hates one of the king's Chamberlain and tell hates why are you crying in the street and so on we know the story so she got the information and this is where we got to words take it not to yourself you'll Escape go gather the Jews and watch fast for me now watch this part she said I'll fast also you know some people pray for me pray for me they're not praying for theel you know pray for nobody else you know they other people pray you know so you la pray for meay pastor pray Pastor pray who you praying for you praying for you you praying for nobody but you requesting prayer request from everybody pray pray pray for me pray for me that out pray for yourself and pray for others too oh give the Lord some praise Hallelujah so Esther say fast for me yes sir neither eat nor drink three days on night and I also and my maidens will Fast likewise right so it's not like es am queen you know the fast you have McDonald's youy chicken Chinese food store right corner no she's making that sacrifice because things has changed that's right yes sir overnight and things will change yes sir overnight that's right not gradually you know overnight we just had a pandemic that's right every country obeyed lock down shut down every country wasn't lining up what you will happen for the next one or the next move or whatever is to come people going to line up but the brandom said the bride the people who follow the pillar fire will have a rough time he said a bride will be a hunted persecuted group he said a bride they will close down the churches that's right that's not me words that is Spirit spoken words that's a vision from God so if you think we'll have it just coming to church normal say hallelujah there's a rare thing when I go to the church I always tell the church it's a privilege for me to be here I don't consider it a right because one day will not be like this that's right one day we may be gathering homes yes sir that's right Esther the revelation of who she was was held back yes sir she's dear she's Queen that's right but there's a purpose behind she being there sir isn't that right so watch and then you know this story Esther when she said if I perish I perish she went to the to the king and then King approved he held out to Esther the golden scepter was in hand Esther Drew near then the king said unto her what will thou Queen Esther what is I request even to have the Kingdom so now she is now positionally placed in a position of power yes sir she touch a scepter and one of these days this bride of Jesus Christ who have been elected this bride of Jesus Christ who have been called this spite of Jesus Christ who have been anointed will be positionally placed into a position of power the crit's mouth will be shut the sick will be healed by a word man will speak the word and he'll create itself just like that oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Ephesians 4:7 says unto everyone of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so tonight Hallelujah Ephesians 4 7-13 includes everybody everybody have a measure so you sit here tonight and you have a measure it have Housewives daughters praise God whoever it is praise God God have a measure for you the measure of the stature of the fullness of

Arts no grud she's climbing up those seven steps and the top step is Brotherly Love where you have to forgive your oughts when you stand praying for charity forgive against anybody isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so she walked up there half my kingdom hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus we're going to finish hallelujah what if it's a time like this anointed to be placed in such a time as this we're going to face a crisis yes sir we have hard times ahead that's right because of what you do what you preparing it's hard times ahead exactly when I think about
