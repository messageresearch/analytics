you are here i want to say god has left we have something to rejoice about we have something to praise god upon amen you may be seated praise god so this morning what a blessing praise god for the peter praise god the seven virtues connected us to the supernatural for another ephesians what a blessing praise god and last night for the raymond ephesians is positionally placed in the bride in christ born and positionally born what a wake-up call in this hour when everybody are settled with their churches and their elders and their deacons and their trustees and their buildings and they have been longing a message and they have all the books and they have all the tapes and they have everything and they don't need nobody and they don't have to come to these meetings and they don't have to do this and they don't have to do that and here god said born and positionally born or you stay in the tribulation maybe you never see this oh my hallelujah oh man we gonna read it he said my word shall not return unto me boy but i shall accomplish the purpose of god amen understanding let's go in the bible for luke 8 ephesians 4 and isaiah 55 first scripture reading tonight reading from luke chapter 8 verse 4 and when much people were gathered together and would come to him out of the every city he spake a parable a sword went out to the sea and as he saw it some fell by the wayside it was trodden down and the falls of the air devoured it and some fell among up on a rock as soon as it was sprung up it ridded away because it lacked moisture some fell among thorns and thorns sprang up with it and choked it and some fell on good ground and sprang up and be a fruit hundred fold when he had said this he cried he'd have ears to hear let him hear and the disciples asked him saying what might this problem be and he said unto you it has given them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in power but seeing they might not see in here and they might not understand now the parable is this their seed is the word of god those that by the wayside are they that here then commit the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts at least they should believe and be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among tones a day which one day i've heard go forth on a choke with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience ephesians 4 verse 11 says and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ still we all come in the unity of the faith under the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and through and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slay of men and calling craftiness whereby the lion wait to receive but speaketh the truth speaking of truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is ahead even christ in whom from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply it according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body onto the edifying of itself in love and from isaiah chapter 55 or final scripture we want to read from verse 6. it says here seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way in the righteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord he will have mercy upon him unto our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways here the lord for the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your wheels and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not thinner but water with the earth and make it bring forth and blood that it may give sea to the saw and bread to the eater so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where i sent to let us pray father we have read your word and any man could read the scriptures lord we just invite your holy spirit to come and bless it and interpret your word to our hearts take me out of the way let me be an empty vessel tonight and shake this place with your revelation and your manifestation in jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated oh praise be to god with our title tonight another ephesians the prophet's prophecy subject original seed vindicated word inspiration he'd have ears to hear let him hear o praise his wonderful name blessed be the name of the lord so this ephesians is not some man's prophecy it's not some doctrine some teaching this is the prophet's prophecy praise god are we gonna find that out tonight praise god you're gonna find out tonight what seed that the prophet planted praise his wonderful name because we know the son of man is the sower praise god everybody know what judah so is the son of man everybody know what the seed is generally the word of god praise god but jesus said he that believe it on me as the scripture had said for the hour so it's not just the word of god it's the word for the hour hallelujah glory to god praise god you may be seated praise god hallelujah my god those those pharisees they were talking about their fathers jesus said that they boasted and said our fathers these man in the wilderness hallelujah they were there they had the word they used manna and jesus washed him and said but everyone dead dead there praise god so don't tell me about some manner ten years ago five years ago i am the living prayer that came down in revelation 10. o hallelujah to introduce that bread which is that seed word to be planted amen oh praise god amen so therefore the seed the word itself came long from heaven revelation 10 praise god i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven with the seven thunders which was the sea to be planted praise god amen amen amen you may be seated all through the old testament they were looking for the coming of the messiah every prophecy was prophesying he is coming he is coming he is coming isaiah said the fiji shall conceive every prophecy was saying he is coming for hundreds and hundreds of years the prophecy was hovering hovering until mary came hallelujah and when everywhere mary went the prophecy was going to because she was the body of the prophecy she was the fulfillment of the prophecy hallelujah glory to god you may be seated and this prophet he prophesied that there will come an ephesians in the last days and that word was hanging all these years it was in the books all these years the prophecy but now it's coming over you you are going to fulfill the prophecy you are not going to be a corinthians church you are not going to be a hebrews baby church you are not going to be a galatians lord church you are gonna be an ephesians church and in that church there's a fightful ministry for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry fourth day of the body till we all come till we all come you may be seated oh hallelujah are we going to say some things today and tonight there is a shaken coming it already started there's a shaken coming in south africa and the rest of the world the elect will come out of all the churches they will call for perfection they will call for the seed they give us seed give us the word give us the prophecy give us up oh man do you maybe see that oh hallelujah man what a shakiness coming praise god i could see ministers at ease and zion contented satisfied because they have 200 300 500 1000 2000 because they have one church two to three churches for church because they they're international does god care about that [Music] [Applause] season oh my oh hallelujah glory my feel good tonight praise god i am blessed i am blessed i'm already blessed praise god praise god one time the disciples walking with jesus for a couple of years jesus turned to them and said who do men say i am son of man who men say i want to hear what they're saying about me i want to hear what they're talking about tell me who did they say i am and they were happy to give the report they said some say you were this some say you were that i heard somebody said you were this somebody said you were that good that's very good you may be caesar no i want you who have been following me to tell me who i am you may be seated and guess what they didn't know they were following without even understanding or knowing what they were following in other words jesus caught them then all of a sudden a brother said don't have the christ jesus look at him he said flesh and blood you just be here like in some church you didn't hear that from somebody nobody can tell you that but the spirit the lord himself my father glory glory to god [Music] you may be seated to jesus watch jesus didn't address the whole group the whole 12. he talked he said what peter i'm talking to you man because you got a revelation i will talk to you because you've got a revelation and upon this rock i'll build my church and the case of hell shall never prevail against you may be seated and the whip revealed you know it means wrestling overcome it means the kill of hell gates of hell will wrestle with it but they will not overcome it so once and brother branham said the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of jesus christ the holy ghost alone is the revealer so you can be sitting there and you get a revelation and the person next to you don't even know what's happening with you they don't know why you're shouting they don't know why your hands up in there they don't know why you're jumping but revelation no true revelation doesn't come here just your mind true revelation comes to your heart you can't explain it i'm going to have a son that's abraham i can't explain it i can't show it i'm kind of old but i know god spoke to me and i know i'm going to have a son that's revelation you maybe see that so jesus didn't say my church will be built upon some man gift my gift my gift jesus never promised to build a church upon somebody's guilt jesus promised to build his church upon revelations you may be seated let me tell you this about revelation revelation will make you stand anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition revelation will make you stand if all of south africa don't believe this revolution will make you stand this is the correct inspiration of malachi sports message glory hallelujah glory to god amen you may be seated where is god mine there's such a charge inside of here maybe we don't have to read any notes maybe we don't have he master court because peter on the day of pentecost said this is the stone to build his reviews who told peter to say that you maybe see this [Music] championship time this is battle time you're on the winning side oh praise god blessed be the name of the lord amen so whatever god says is a seed his word is a seed so when gross darkness cover the earth god didn't argue and say why it's so dark gordon debate how long was it dark god didn't discuss with the darkness god just said let there be light come on preach back to me god didn't argue god didn't question because they let there be light that was the seed and here come the spirit and there was light the manifestation of the sea amen praise god you may be seated amen amen amen amen amen you may be seated no there must be a certain environment for perfection now we are beyond pentecost now we're not talking about bubble dancing and shouting and sweating and carrying on that we don't know who we are we had enough of that we're not talking about that screaming and having a good time and then who are you who are you i don't know where you going i don't know where you come from you still don't know but jesus said at that day you shall know i am in the father he and me and i knew jesus said so and that's the word and that can't be done void it shall accomplish you may be seated hallelujah so there must be a certain environment for perfection and jesus give this parable about the sword the seed and the ground now we know the soul son of man we know the seed generally speaking the word but what type of ground are we forced with all these ears since the prophet left since the prophet left what type of crown had we have to deal with since the prophet amen oh hallelujah so jesus said number one some fell on the wayside on the wayside is drunks that are unprepared i cannot receive seed it is off the beaten track it's people that come and hear and don't understand and go that's me sir so gordon can take all these years to get rid of the wayside that's why i say you are special i'm gonna tell you who you are you maybe see this number two the stone in the rocky hearts they are partially prepared grounds they shout a while dance a while stay in church a while but when trials come when they stand for the revelation come they are gone you can't see them no more are they trouble in the church they gone have a problem happened they gone you might be seated but they have rocks jealousy envy all of this inside of that their heart so if they dry up they don't laugh you may be seated come on jesus dropped the charges at calvary your case is dismissed you are free tonight you may be seated number three tony hat they are also partially prepared brown but the torns were not taken out just as the stone didn't take all the rocks the thorns were allowed to grow and the seed could not grow normally because of the strong cravings strong desires of the heart and the cures of life and the riches and the pleasures and you want to have a host like that brother and you want to have a car like that brother and you want this and you want that and you want the other and you don't want the holy ghost like that you may be seated just remember my friends you are leaving back your bank account you are leaving back your house you are leaving back your car you're leaving back your job where you going i'm going home brother there's a rapture there's a call to the wedding supper you can't carry those things with you covering up this world plain riches that soon rapidly seek to gain the heavenly treasures they will never pass away you may be seated oh praise god hallelujah now notice the closest in bringing fruit was the tawny because they grew but the thorns chopped them and jesus placed it correctly he said they bring no fruit to perfection they will bring fruit but not to perfect them oh my you may be seated oh praise god amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord we just lean our foundation here tonight oh praise god amen so we want to just look at this same parable you don't have to open the bibles in matthew 13. and i want to read verse 18. he said hear ye therefore the parable of the sword this is another way jesus saying that now when one hearing the word of the kingdom and understanding it not he's going down a little depth now watch and then they understand it not then commit the wicked one and catch it away that which was sown in his heart this is heath which received seed by the west side so the wayside didn't understand it this tony didn't understand it the tonys didn't understand it but listen to what jesus said in 23 he said but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that carried the wood and understands it watch which also breathe with fruit and bring it forth some a hundred fold some sixty some city so you know who you are tonight you are good grown shake somebody hand and tell them i am good girl [Applause] you may be seated oh praise god so let's hit the message tonight amen now the sword is the son of man and the fever is the earth and the seed is the word of god the seed is the word of god now this is some show as the father he said now the seed in the right ground will produce its kind corn will produce corn powder will produce valley wheat will bring wheat and any divine promise of god will bring the results if it is placed on the ground and watered with prayer with faith and with trust god will bring it to pass i am saying it with experience amen now jesus had all these fine qualities of god in him do you believe it he had powers upon power so when he met satan he never used his power he gave an example for the weakest christian when he met satan he said it is written man shall live by bread alone but by every word i proceeded out of the mouth of god the weakest christian can take a whole of god's word and every time when he meets the enemy he said it is written i believe he had the power to do it but when he meant satan on the same grounds with the same way that you meet him you said it's written you believe it you maybe say that it's written now jesus went down in matthew 11. he said now whatsoever things you desire watch it when you pray believe you receive it and you shall receive it in other words believe it got it already and you will get it so that is why after you receive a promise you thank god for it because you accepted you maybe see this oh my praise god there was somebody with some disease i can't remember what disease was it was very contagious and they called by the brain of the free and the doctors didn't want to go around to go in the hospital room and and and eventually you know they say that if he was a priest that they said but is married he shouldn't go where he's going number one just went nearby oh lord jesus heal the child and jesus amen and walked out and the woman began to rejoice and say just think honey our child is going to be healed oh praise god thank you jesus the woman began to thank god immediately and the doctor said the doctor said oh you know are you fooling them or whatever and he said he said doctor you are looking at those instruments but i am looking at the word of god [Applause] so as soon as you are prayed for you believe you are going to be delivered thank you lord when you deliver us you are going to be healed thank you for healing oh glory you may be seated amen so watch he said now listen what brahman says now believe present tense you receive it you shall have it it will be given to you later this is words now but believe it now before you get your crop you have to plant the seed water it believe it he said don't dig it up every morning to see if they keep picking it up it will never grow that is why god said my word shall not return to me boy oh hallelujah amen amen praise god amen so therefore i the lord had planted it i watered day and night please some should pluck it out of my hand there you are god is in his word amen and anything god speaks he means that god sees it there's so many things but it must come to pass amen so he said tower in the city of jerusalem until you endured paul from one high i'm going to send you the promise of the father yes that was god's word christ was the word he said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you and you would pour from on high so that was the word that word is what drove them to jerusalem to wait there and when that word was manifested praise god that was the fulfillment of the word when the power came in the ring praise god so we have promised a rain to come on the seeds that have been planted but the prophet said all kinds of seed was sown but god have been looking for the right seeds to send the dynamics to the mechanics to send the lacquer in and i want to let you know tonight you are the right seat oh man you made me say that oh hallelujah like i tell them back women trying to say one of these days the bride the church the people when they realize there'll be two are there one taking one left they're going to fly out these bogus churches they're going to fly out of them under the force anointed they're going to fly out because they're recognized as an individual affair between you and god and i wouldn't let no man stop me from going in the rapture if the whole jews leave i'm still going glory oh my you already see that it's good to belong to churches and groups and so on fine you have to be in one you may be seated but we come along to the showdown now what kind of church is it is it a corinthian church a hebrew church praise god a filthy church an ungodly church a legalistic church a contrary church an interpretation church where you got to come out of it if you want to be perfected you have to come into ephesian hallelujah you may be seated and another ephesians is not some man's word it's not by the reigns words this is the prophet's prophecy are we going to read it tonight god didn't promise all these bunch of churches all over the world god didn't promise in the last days god promised another ephesians bright church you may be seated oh hallelujah so god shake off the wayside the stony the tony and shake all these years there are people who was in the 70s were looking like my god it was close to adoption no you can't even find where they're living now you don't know where they are they're people who was in the 80s you can't even find them they're all back sitting somewhere in the 80s they were looking powerful where are they today praise god but god was waiting for another generation god was waiting for the year 2001 what was waiting for you what was waiting for this meeting the best place to be tonight is in this meeting gloria gloria lavonne hallelujah glory to you may be god praise god how come somebody could be a christian and claim to be a bride and have these meetings going on they wouldn't come and be nearby or whatever praise god what is tyrion oh have been a portion of this group and this church my god that's why the bible said in ephesians there's one body i remember when i started to preach overseas i was praying i said lord i don't want to leave my church and go over season three why should i go you know i was concerned about that i didn't want to leave the sheep back home and holy spirit spoke to me and said you are going in the kingdom by the kingdom for the kingdom he's not interested in countries he's interested in the body of christ and my blood cell could go any part of my body so he's interested in the body of christ so i'm in johannesburg south africa but i am preaching to the body i am preaching for the birthday i am preaching hindi [Music] to god so i know i am at my post of duty tonight because god told me to preach the word hallelujah and the preaching of the word cannot be in word only but it must be in power and demonstration of the spirit oh my you may be seated praise god amen amen amen my god bless you young man stay on fire we love god god have a special blessing for you young people i know the devil is mad after you but when the enemy comes like a flat the spirit of god will raise up a standard cancelled [Applause] [Applause] glory hallelujah maybe she did come on man let me talk to you a little bit young people for the branham brought the whole syllabus for the school course he revealed the whole syllabus every mystery has been revealed don't skip classes you have all the material to get seven ears you have all the material to pass your examination come on come on come on young people you can make it you can make it you can make it you can make it you shall be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] you remember cece oh praise god my holy spirit is here hurry is god anything can happen [Music] oh when the holy spirit is here anything can happen you don't know the last name may be here tonight what the problem says when the last name is redeemed then the book is closed how do you not know we are going to preach to the last name on that book the lottery is fixing to fall the real reign is about to fall you may be seated you may think you just come to another meeting number eight but who do you not know what god is doing in this weekend you may be seated one time there was a church meeting it was very ordinary the man walked into that building he found a scripture in isaiah 61. people were sitting the ordinary as usual they were hearing different teachings as usual all of a sudden this man took up the scripture and said the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me to bring good tidings to open the eyes of the blind and to to open the ears of the death hollow under set up liberty them that abound the proclaim to jubilee year to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and they thought he was just reading the scripture but then he said this day in your hearing this scripture is fulfilled another man stepped forward in this last day named william marion branham and he prophesied that there was going to be another ephesians and we are coming tonight to say in your hearing in your hair and you are hearing it this scripture is fulfilled we are here original seed indicated well the world is already vindicated and we are preaching to you original seed seed from malachi 4. notice we are not preaching anything new i don't want appreciating you i want it will reign you may be seated why are you saying about all of it because the bible said in the last days they shall keep unto themselves teachers having itchiness oh my they want to hear some favors they want to hear about angels they want to hear about the other side and this and that you maybe see this i always get a problem when a man preaching too long about the other side because he has never been there i have not seen yes have not heard [Music] oh you may be seated i don't know how i'm going to get into this oh i'm locked inside of here tonight you will be seated oh praise god amen now listen to this but if i'm says i can prove he said that the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass he said no and he's not there with a shock notice that the two spiritual last days the true spirit is not just people now with the truth spirit the third spirit of the church people and the bright spirit of the bright people two spirits church spirit bright spirit listen he says it will be so close it will deceive the elect if it is possible now looter in the church is bringing forth the bright sea with the same spirit now let's go a little bit you may be seated now watch pentecost represented mary mary the last stage of it yet she was not the seed yet the life this the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet so as long as that seed is not mature mary carrying seed looking like seed mary resembling seed but she's not deceived but once the nine months is up jesus comes out and once you maybe see that once the time is up the seed gets mature and move from yellow to golden brown and the shark move from green to yellow you may be seated so in the message in the earlies all green chuck is green seed is green everybody green everybody's saying what they want preaching what they want but there comes a lot that we be no more children taught to us no becoming mature now we come and look like children when i was a child i speak like a child i understood as a child but when i became a man put away childish things we are talking about perfect man we are talking about a stature we are talking about an image one day they're going to come a representation of the seven months gonna represent seven churches january february march april may june july we'll have a harvest he said maybe some minister will pick it up and we will have it so right now we are right now praise god because the seed must be right in order to go down on the ground you see jesus he was seed oh let's back up a little bit adam was seed of the world he had character by creation jesus was the flesh of the world he had character by formation jesus learned obedience by the thing that he suffered he had 30 years of heart trials three years of harder trials hallelujah so when jesus came in the back god said i'm pleased with him i'm going to check him out i'm going to try hallelujah i'm going to put some pressure on him i'm pleased to dwell on him but give him some more time give him three more years and god come around to check on the son he said this is not only my standard please but hear him he is qualified he have his masters he could speak he could stand maybe see this so adam didn't have that character formation because he didn't have the grounds of trousers and testings so then the bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god watched the word became flesh and dwelt among us he came onto his own his own received him not his own but as many or hear it to them give me power watch not to become the what he didn't get empowered to become an adult but power to become watched i should say that back again the power didn't make them an instant adult that's what i mean to say it was power to become [Music] so in other words god will give us tape a revelation virtue and manifestation knowledge praise god but we are going to die out and produce temperance patience godliness probably kindness oh hallelujah hallelujah then the seat is dead right ready for charity surprise absolute to come and seal it down and perfection paul called it the bund of perfectness seal everything in there was no leaks in the building nothing could shake you your imagination conscious affection seal them praise god nothing my evil talk will come inside of there devil has to get permission to even address you praise god when you speak demons flee praise back off because here come a son here come her daughter here come the manifestation amen by the peter of the sons of god oh hallelujah could you take some more why don't we have a whole lot inside of here words satisfication pentecost restoration of the gifts so buddha brown said no they denominated one word another would another word but they have got to we have got to get something that cannot be denominated and here what he said it is it is the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again in the bride so the only thing that cannot be denominated is those seven virtues [Applause] the seven virtues is the entirety of the life now you may be seated now malachi 4 had to gather all the scattered words you have to pick up all the loose ends or what they left off pick it up tie it back in the word to bring down the holy ghost now remember the holy ghost was born at the river euphrates by two hundred thousand thousand devils defend the holy ghost hallelujah but he said the anti-message is the lucid oh glory amen oh praise god amen you wanna be seated so therefore if there is a seed to come that must be the entirety of the life where must that seat come from under which seal the probably the first car to be second on the cabin third it cannot be fought cavalry is six it cut it it must only be the seventh seal we know whether branham took the seven thunders on the back and put it on the first four of the seventh seal on the inside that we wouldn't have fourteen seals because there were seven in and said no so he took the seven in the back and put it under the seventh seal on the inside and then they put silence over it and when he had opened the seventh sea there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour when you have reason to see it god will show it god would reveal it are we ready let's go further you may be seated the messenger of malachi 4 is to do two things that's what he said right you may be seated two things reveal the mystery of the seven sundance and turn the half of the children back to the faith of the father two things but in reality it is one because he said it is these divinely revealed mystery truths is what will literally turn the house of the children back so let's come down now to the prophet's prophecy human beings let's go back again malachi forced to do two things according to jesus book reveal the mystery of the seven thunders and to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers let's say that a little different back to the faith of the ephesians fathers so to go forward you have to go back before you're going to rapture you have to go back pick up the fate that peter had paul had pick that up then go you see it you may be seated so in reality it was only one thing maybe just repeating again he said it will be these be finally revealed missed your truth you know no you know that people like to emphasize the mystic truths back i like to emphasize divine review part so in trinidad there was this brother he's talking about mr truth no they don't want to connect the virtues they don't want that they want to talk mr truth stop so he said mystery truths and he said if you're not preaching the mystery truths you're not preaching the thunders because the thunders unfold the mysteries and unfall into tongues and other things i say fine i said how many mr jews because they have flanked him institution i said how many he couldn't answer me i said friends there's only seven oh hallelujah glory never say a friend it's only seven and if you can't tell me those seven i don't want to hear the rest of mysteries that you have because the seven thunders equals seven mysteries that was thrown in the way and they fought for to bring there so all these mystery preachers forget that they are finished do i know all mysteries do i have all knowledge if i don't have the thing to catch the headstone i am nothing but i love you all might call you a blessed bunch to preach to hallelujah mom feel good preaching to you we must do this again hallelujah glory amen amen oh man you may be see that i've got to wrap up here somewhere oh my hallelujah so do you get it now brother branham came to reveal the thunder in order that our hearts could return back to the ephesian fathers oh hallelujah amen praise god so our message is to manifest christ you may be seated on the seventh under revelation is an invitation to mold your character into the world image of jesus christ you can take ii peter 1 4 through 7 and slide it into ephesians 4 for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the any time of the body till we all come in the united states knowledge of the son of god here it is until a measure of this touch of a perfect man you can take second peter and slide it in there amen glory till we all come to the fullness of christ the system full of measure you man you may be seated oh praise god oh hallelujah amen glory cupendava preach the true message my mind [Music] hallelujah praise this wonderful name ma'am i'm happy praise god because i know you could worship south africa hallelujah i know you could identify yourself with revelation 5 because you see your name on that book god amen glory to god and then you will be seated now they want to fight worship they want to fight shouting and praising god they want us to have like a kingdom hall there's another jew there's not a jehovah witness church this is the kingdom of god not kingdom hall we're not having lectures here we are in saints that see the name on the book and you rise your razor praise god to say amen glory hallelujah even the elders didn't sit down quiet they cast on their crowns and they gave glory to the lamb they wasn't looking for a minister seek there was worshipping with everybody else glory to god you might be seated man some of the great conventions are ministers praise god they don't want to worship so every minute the writing the writing the writing they could get the tape they could get the video but they're writing oh forget it praise god and they want the people
