[55:04] Father's Day praise God isn't a great

[55:10] great thing to be a father tremendous
[55:13] opportunity to handle stress and to

[55:19] opportunity to see lives shaped and as
[55:23] we thank God for all the stress that he
[55:25] places in our lives
[55:26] and all the challenges he placed in our
[55:28] way God is pleased by having the right
[55:31] frame of mind towards the life that he

[55:45] father our heavenly father that
[55:47] straighten out his sons you are you
[55:49] wouldn't be doing the writing if you
[55:50] don't straighten out your own sons and
[55:52] your own children because that's what
[55:54] God does see so so we have to reflect
[55:58] him that's what we so greetings from the
[56:00] LCA London I was out to services in
[56:03] Miami and then afterwards had to make
[56:05] the trip to London to go to the funeral
[56:08] of Pastor Peter Chandler it was as if
[56:12] things was pre-arranged for me to be
[56:14] there I was invited to speak on
[56:16] Wednesday night this is Wednesday past
[56:19] service and um and I believe that you'll
[56:22] be blessed with that service we can have
[56:24] that this morning the funeral service
[56:26] was outstanding over 50 pastors was
[56:29] there from around the world and more
[56:32] would have been there had it been uh not
[56:35] for Visa issues I know some of you here
[56:38] may not have seen it so what I want to
[56:40] do this morning is to take an extract
[56:42] from it and we want to go over into the
[56:45] Wednesday service that I preach across
[56:46] there by God's grace the message that I
[56:49] preached there was cemented by love the
[56:53] bride because the prophet said there'll
[56:55] be no love left among except among the
[56:57] bride we are in treacherous time right
[57:01] now and I sure you might have known that
[57:04] Putin has brought some warships down to
[57:06] the Caribbean right right right by Cuba
[57:09] 90 miles from the shore of America to
[57:12] show his strength and force this is not
[57:13] going to slow down you know T going to
[57:16] build up and I think that um the
[57:19] pressures that will come around would
[57:21] make some of you shake from your little
[57:24] petty um
[57:26] cockroach um ANS trials that you have
[57:31] and you'd realize there's some bigger
[57:33] things to deal with and you know it come
[57:37] like somebody complain they have no
[57:39] shoes and they stop complaining when
[57:40] they saw somebody with no feet it come
[57:43] like things are very very relative to
[57:45] your own experience as we see a a pipe
[57:48] dripping in your house d emergency we
[57:51] fire catch in the kitchen there's a
[57:52] different story you could lay back on
[57:54] the bed and say click click trip trip
[57:56] drip drip the Trap is just dripping but
[57:58] the fire bur fire burning that's not
[58:01] working you know as Star as you might be
[58:03] You' fly out that bed and jump out and
[58:05] do something about that fire because
[58:07] fire is fire you lose everything so
[58:10] sometimes just how the pressures of Life
[58:12] come that deals with us and I I was
[58:15] amazed by what I saw on the strength of
[58:17] the family and I pray that God bless
[58:19] them and keep praying for them s Monica
[58:21] but I think that the extract that you
[58:23] would see today would give you a clear
[58:25] picture
[58:26] of Life of life stories you see a man
[58:29] come here but a Peter and see him preach
[58:31] but you don't know his history you don't
[58:33] know his story you get an opportunity to

[1:07:20] now it's an honor for me to ask the
[1:07:24] daughter
[1:07:26] sister sanche to come forward to read a
[1:07:29] poem sister s
[1:08:11] thank
[1:08:14] you owed to a
[1:08:17] candle in this city a humble candle was
[1:08:22] placed molded by God redeemed by God's
[1:08:26] grace but the times were dark and sin
[1:08:30] was
[1:08:31] Surplus but a candle lit in daylight has
[1:08:35] no
[1:08:37] purpose he thought life would continue
[1:08:39] on the path that he rode on but God's
[1:08:43] vessels don't choose him no they are
[1:08:47] chosen God set him a light in the
[1:08:50] spiritual night to shine bright against
[1:08:53] darkness and fight the the good
[1:08:57] fight he beamed God's word to the grown
[1:09:00] Olden youth a holy illumination of the
[1:09:04] spirit of
[1:09:07] Truth and that flame sparked in London
[1:09:10] bringing light to the locals soon spread
[1:09:13] through the nation International then
[1:09:16] Global how far that little candle beams
[1:09:19] did reach because he preached what he
[1:09:22] lived and he lived what he preached
[1:09:27] this candle he burned to give others
[1:09:29] God's light sacrificing all for his
[1:09:33] calling to
[1:09:36] Christ whilst working in church one
[1:09:40] spring afternoon his soul was blown away
[1:09:43] in a moment too
[1:09:47] sudden too
[1:09:51] soon dark clouds above cast an honor
[1:09:55] Gloom the Earth shook beneath us though
[1:09:59] the ground did not move tears fell like
[1:10:03] rain our eyes blurred with mist but in
[1:10:07] the center of
[1:10:08] Darkness Godlike
[1:10:12] persists in that moment when darkness
[1:10:15] was
[1:10:16] anticipated the hearts of the Brethren
[1:10:20] illuminated the candle took flight to
[1:10:23] eternal light but his per purpose was
[1:10:26] not here to stand and shine
[1:10:29] bright God used him to set Christian
[1:10:32] hearts a
[1:10:33] light and from this god-given flame did
[1:10:36] 10,000
[1:10:39] ignite though his light never dimmed as
[1:10:42] he passed on God's Flame the word spread
[1:10:45] like wildfire again and
[1:10:48] again thousands of candles were lit from
[1:10:51] that one now his work is complete
[1:10:56] but your works just
[1:10:57] begun his light still Shines on in
[1:11:00] another dimension but we who remain are
[1:11:04] that light's life extension we are Heirs
[1:11:07] of his mission our way has been shown
[1:11:10] this church that he's founded was built
[1:11:13] with strong
[1:11:15] Stones there is no deflection we have
[1:11:18] our direction we are a projection of
[1:11:22] God's light
[1:11:23] reflection just as that can CLE was to
[1:11:26] you and me be the light that helps other
[1:11:29] people to see fear not the darkness stay
[1:11:33] in line for without Darkness light
[1:11:37] cannot
[1:11:38] shine darkness is only the absence of
[1:11:41] light the darker the times makes God's
[1:11:45] light shine more
[1:11:46] bright let love be The Guiding Light in
[1:11:49] all you do shine bright beam far glow
[1:11:53] righteous burn true brothers and
[1:11:58] sisters every boy and girl take up your
[1:12:02] candle and light up the
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:11] world shall we put our hands together
[1:12:14] first the phone reading from the
[1:12:16] daughter
[1:12:20] Sansa the light of a candle in the
[1:12:22] darkness we thank God
[1:12:25] I'd like now to call upon our precious
[1:12:28] Reverend Theo ovit from head hstone
[1:12:31] Tabernacle in Trinidad he will come and
[1:12:33] give his tribute on behalf of all the
[1:12:36] ministers can we put our hands together
[1:12:38] for our Reverend
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:59] again I'd wish to express our
[1:13:01] condolences to Sister Monica the family
[1:13:04] and the
[1:13:06] church without a
[1:13:08] question Pastor Peter's impact on the
[1:13:11] message landscape was
[1:13:13] staggering so many pastors ministers
[1:13:16] shared their Ministry with the local
[1:13:19] Christian Assembly London likewise he
[1:13:22] was willing to share his ministry with
[1:13:24] others
[1:13:25] he had a unique style in presenting this
[1:13:28] glorious
[1:13:30] gospel it was
[1:13:32] different because he was
[1:13:34] different this distinction made him
[1:13:38] genuinely authentic and
[1:13:40] original I believe he had a genuine
[1:13:43] revelation of this message which
[1:13:46] reflected in his attitude and way of
[1:13:49] life but Peter was a humble Soul he
[1:13:53] understood the sovereignity of the local
[1:13:56] church he stood as a Watchman in the
[1:13:59] tower and stood guard against the power
[1:14:02] of the
[1:14:02] nians and other contrary Spirits which
[1:14:05] sought to undermine and destroy the
[1:14:08] church that God has placed under his
[1:14:10] care his precious wife s Monica
[1:14:13] succinctly stated they saw everyone that
[1:14:17] walked into the
[1:14:19] church because she was his first
[1:14:22] convert the enemy tried and failed but
[1:14:25] the Peter stood his grounds a Man Who
[1:14:29] Loved God loved God's people loved the
[1:14:34] cause I call him the man they could not
[1:14:39] break despite knowing that his welcome
[1:14:42] at convention meetings was often
[1:14:45] half-hearted he continued to
[1:14:47] attend he was truly the man they could
[1:14:51] not
[1:14:51] break never arrogant Hy or indifferent
[1:14:56] he conquered in humility a man of few
[1:15:00] words he had a way of disarming you with
[1:15:03] his infectious smile and embracing you
[1:15:06] with his warmth through his love and
[1:15:09] kindness he
[1:15:11] Triumph what stood out most to me was
[1:15:14] that I never heard him speak an evil
[1:15:17] word about
[1:15:19] anyone the man they could not break has
[1:15:23] now broken free from the judgments of
[1:15:26] man and is in the father's presence he
[1:15:30] has finished his course and he kept the
[1:15:33] Fate I feel blessed to have known him to
[1:15:36] have been associated with him and to
[1:15:39] have stood by him I salute him as a real
[1:15:42] Christian and a true servant of God he
[1:15:46] has left a legacy of sacrifice devotion
[1:15:50] and dedication to the cause of the
[1:15:53] Gospel May the comforter God strengthen
[1:15:57] and guide you
[1:15:58] all I could see when you arrive at
[1:16:00] Heaven's portal the angel said welcome
[1:16:04] home our lost here of brother Peter's
[1:16:08] passing is heaven gain in the land of
[1:16:12] perfect love an eagle has
[1:16:15] landed he will be missed by all of us
[1:16:18] God bless you all
[1:16:27] praise the Lord amen appreciate the
[1:16:30] tribute amen can we clap our hands again
[1:16:32] for Reverend F over from hstone
[1:16:36] Tabernacle near that experience that
[1:16:40] made me realize that there is a God I
[1:16:43] was miraculously saved from drowning and
[1:16:46] after such an experience I began to
[1:16:49] search for salvation and I started to
[1:16:52] read my Bible I read from Genesis to
[1:16:56] Revelation when I got into Revelation I
[1:17:00] struggled to grasp the meaning I cried
[1:17:03] tears of confusion trying to make sense
[1:17:07] of what I was reading during that time a
[1:17:10] religious track was put through my door
[1:17:13] it convicted me so much that I visited a
[1:17:17] little Pentecostal group that gathered
[1:17:20] near my home I invited the leader and
[1:17:24] sister to come to my house and have a
[1:17:27] meal because I wanted him to explain the
[1:17:30] Book of Revelation to me when he turned
[1:17:32] up he came with the sister and a young
[1:17:36] Caucasian man from
[1:17:38] Zimbabwe straight away I was annoyed I
[1:17:42] was prejudice against him and I showed
[1:17:44] it I was angry with the group leader for
[1:17:47] inviting him to come without my
[1:17:51] permission so I refused to invite him to
[1:17:54] my my table and offer him any food that
[1:17:57] I cooked I was fuming anyhow I gave him
[1:18:02] a cup of tea and a slice of angel cake
[1:18:05] and I thought that was good enough for
[1:18:07] him my sister Marva felt so bad for this
[1:18:11] visitor eating cake while we ate our
[1:18:15] rice and peas and she rebuked me she
[1:18:19] told me if I'm going to be a Christian I
[1:18:22] need to put that racism behind me
[1:18:25] I was not happy but she forced me to
[1:18:28] offer him some of my food and he enjoyed
[1:18:31] it sometime after that I visited the
[1:18:35] Pentecostal group again they asked me to
[1:18:37] give my testimony I shared with them my
[1:18:41] near-death experience when I nearly
[1:18:44] drowned in the sea in Greece after the
[1:18:47] meeting the same guy that I treated so
[1:18:51] badly at my house came to talk to me he
[1:18:55] wanted to know more about my experience
[1:18:58] he shared that he also had a clo shave
[1:19:01] with death that had led him to search
[1:19:03] for Christ I told him I found that
[1:19:06] Pentecostal group when a track was put
[1:19:09] through my letter box I found out that
[1:19:12] it was him that put it through my door
[1:19:15] during his Outreach and that was before
[1:19:18] we even met that's when he told me his
[1:19:21] name Peter Peter Chandler he asked me me
[1:19:25] if I could help him with his Outreach to
[1:19:28] be a shoper room because people often
[1:19:31] ask him to come into their home and pray
[1:19:34] with them this is how we started
[1:19:37] spreading the message in South
[1:19:40] London Peter was from a star middle
[1:19:43] class family in Zimbabwe they did not
[1:19:47] practice Christianity when he came to
[1:19:50] London he met a West Indian man by the
[1:19:54] name of of Albert lamant who witnessed
[1:19:57] to him he asked him are you saved Peter
[1:20:01] felt challenged by this question and so
[1:20:05] convicted by this witness he gave his
[1:20:08] heart to the Lord and got baptized in
[1:20:12] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ after
[1:20:15] that he started to attend a Pentecostal
[1:20:18] church he later met a brother in the
[1:20:21] Pentecostal Church who lent him a book
[1:20:24] book The Seven seal by Brother William
[1:20:28] branam around the same time he received
[1:20:31] this book Peter's life took a
[1:20:34] devastating turn he was involved in a
[1:20:37] horrific explosion leaving him with
[1:20:40] severe burns that confined him to
[1:20:43] hospital he read the Seven Seals while
[1:20:46] lying in his hospital bed and then bang
[1:20:50] a spiritual explosion happened an
[1:20:53] explosion of not just Divine Healing but
[1:20:57] one that forever changed his life by the
[1:21:00] time he's finished reading he was
[1:21:03] completely healed with not a scar left
[1:21:06] on him Peter wrote to brother Billy Paul
[1:21:10] at voice of God recording requesting
[1:21:13] books he was so supportive of this young
[1:21:17] evangelist who wanted to spread the
[1:21:20] message he sent him a box of message
[1:21:23] books the book books and tape they
[1:21:26] diligently supplied helped Peter to
[1:21:29] establish the message in London he felt
[1:21:32] a deep calling to tell the Pentecostal
[1:21:36] that God has send us a prophet he faced
[1:21:39] a lot of resentment and opposition for
[1:21:43] it when I heard the message I knew it
[1:21:47] was nothing but the truth and I
[1:21:50] supported Peter in his Zeal to spread
[1:21:53] the word but I was my husband's first
[1:21:57] convert that's how we started it was
[1:22:00] Pete me and 62 Empty Chairs he was the
[1:22:05] song leader the musician he played the
[1:22:08] piano the guitar the accordion he was
[1:22:11] the Deacon the Usher the preacher we
[1:22:14] printed our own tracks and handed them
[1:22:17] all over South London God started to
[1:22:20] bless our little effort my sister Verona
[1:22:24] was a second convert followed by my
[1:22:27] other sisters Marva and Shirley then
[1:22:31] sister Gwen and brother Terry who later
[1:22:33] married and then Lawson who married my
[1:22:36] sister Marva we outreached all over
[1:22:40] London we would set up in Speaker's
[1:22:43] Corner in hide Park and in SoHo the West
[1:22:47] End of London was a regular spot where
[1:22:50] Peter preached he declared that God has
[1:22:53] send us a prop
[1:22:55] and told the people about the coming of
[1:22:58] the Lord the Pentecostal they called us
[1:23:01] branhamites they laugh us we book Halls
[1:23:05] to show The Prophet's film H you know
[1:23:08] I'm waiting for something that is true

[1:23:12] I'm just as helpless as it could be just
[1:23:14] like any the rest of you and I'm here

[1:24:23] the power of Jes Jesus Christ be made
[1:24:25] manifest Lord we but we're not defeated
[1:24:30] Satan iure thee in the name of the Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus Christ when Peter preached on the
[1:24:36] street we were mocked and Echo people
[1:24:39] through hot charcoal at us from the
[1:24:43] roasted Chestnut drums despite the
[1:24:46] challenges Peter's faith never wavered
[1:24:49] people came and asked for prayers some
[1:24:53] even made confession S one man even made
[1:24:57] a confession of murder he got away with
[1:25:00] it but when Peter preached he got very
[1:25:04] convicted and confessed as message
[1:25:07] Believers in London we were very
[1:25:10] isolated brother Billy Paul put us in
[1:25:13] touch with Brother Andy strevens he was
[1:25:16] the first message believer we met in the
[1:25:19] UK the Lord provided faithful and
[1:25:23] supportive men in England and later in
[1:25:27] Europe to encourage Peter in the service
[1:25:30] of the Lord I know Peter would want me
[1:25:33] to thank them as I supported Peter's
[1:25:37] vision it became my vision too his
[1:25:40] purpose became my purpose when he asked
[1:25:44] me to marry him all I could think of I
[1:25:48] didn't want to lose my friend I didn't
[1:25:51] realize how deeply I'd fallen in love
[1:25:53] with him
[1:25:54] and I said yes we were married in less
[1:25:57] than a year Peter was a spiritual
[1:26:01] Pioneer LED and guided by a Divine
[1:26:05] intelligence he labored to spread the
[1:26:07] message and bring as many Souls as he
[1:26:10] could to Christ not just in London he
[1:26:14] led the way boldly into Africa with his
[1:26:18] missionary and his charity work when
[1:26:21] other Western ministers were hesitant
[1:26:24] he once provided boats for believers to
[1:26:28] cross a dangerous river to get to church
[1:26:31] a brother later wrote to thank him for
[1:26:35] those boats as they saved lives when a
[1:26:38] war broke out the Believers used them to
[1:26:41] escape his missionary work led him to
[1:26:45] minister in many parts of the world the
[1:26:49] LCA Church grew and so did our family we
[1:26:54] had had three children Abigail Sania and
[1:26:58] Gabriel the families in the church grew
[1:27:01] also and so did the Sunday School Every
[1:27:04] Soul was precious to Peter he was
[1:27:07] passionate about keeping youth off the
[1:27:10] street he put together a youth program
[1:27:13] with Christian activities the faithful
[1:27:17] and talented Timothy King shared his
[1:27:20] vision the youth enacted produ ctions he
[1:27:24] put together gain Global attention
[1:27:28] people from all over the world came to
[1:27:31] attend LCA youth Retreats Ash Burham
[1:27:36] kwood all screen and currently gilwell
[1:27:40] Park it's been a privilege to see those
[1:27:44] children grow into young men and women
[1:27:47] of God having their own children some of
[1:27:51] the young people we knew as kids have
[1:27:54] become pastors as Peter preached the
[1:27:57] word little LCA that began with me and
[1:28:01] him and the empty chair expanded and
[1:28:04] that's when we move here to our present
[1:28:07] church building many churches has sprung
[1:28:10] from this little church that began with
[1:28:13] just me and him Peter faced many
[1:28:16] challenges but none like the pandemic he
[1:28:20] had an unfailing sense of service he
[1:28:24] fulfill every obligation he undertook if
[1:28:27] he said he was going to do something he
[1:28:30] did it he worked in the church on the
[1:28:34] church and for the church so when the
[1:28:37] lockdown came and churches all over the
[1:28:39] world was forbidden to congregate the
[1:28:43] Lord inspired Peter with an idea and now
[1:28:48] I'm going to break protocol and call
[1:28:51] another name that helped the pastor to
[1:28:54] bring the word to the people and that is
[1:28:57] our precious brother Emmanuel he caught
[1:29:00] the pastor's vision and agreed to assist
[1:29:04] him the LCA live streaming enabled Peter
[1:29:09] to Pastor his entire congregation Sunday
[1:29:13] school teachers were able to teach their
[1:29:17] classes remotely from the cres 0 to 3
[1:29:22] Alpha Omega Omega plus Sunday school
[1:29:26] class when youth Retreats were banned
[1:29:29] because of social distancing Peter
[1:29:32] invented the youth and air where he
[1:29:35] organized overseas ministers to speak to
[1:29:38] the youth it was a big success and a
[1:29:41] great encouragement to the young people
[1:29:45] at such a dark and unpredictable time
[1:29:48] during the lockdown Peter used the time
[1:29:51] to refurbish the church he he installed
[1:29:54] air conditioning and ventilation unit he
[1:29:57] studied the government guideline and put
[1:30:00] everything in place for when the people
[1:30:02] could return to church there was nothing
[1:30:05] he couldn't fix or make he cemented a
[1:30:09] 100 foot path in our backyard by himself
[1:30:14] he loved the challenge and if he didn't
[1:30:16] know how he taught himself he was an
[1:30:20] engineer son he used every kind of tool
[1:30:24] he worked with wood metal brick or
[1:30:27] cement if the item he needed wasn't in
[1:30:30] the shop he makes it himself I have
[1:30:34] furnitures in my house that he built
[1:30:38] older than my children and they're as
[1:30:40] solid as the day he built them he built
[1:30:43] his first motorbike at the age of 17 he
[1:30:47] didn't mind getting his hands dirty for
[1:30:49] the last 3 years most of his time was
[1:30:53] spent working on the church building
[1:30:55] every Wednesday he would go to church
[1:30:58] early to work on the next project and
[1:31:01] that is how his last day started out it
[1:31:04] was just a typical Wednesday we left the
[1:31:08] house
[1:31:08] early he drove 40 miles from our home in
[1:31:13] Kent to take me to my sister's house in
[1:31:17] London he left us there because he was
[1:31:19] going to meet a photographer who was
[1:31:22] going to take pictures of the church
[1:31:24] building before he left to go to church
[1:31:27] he Pat me on my shoulder and said see
[1:31:30] you later those were his last words to
[1:31:34] me and you know the rest well the events
[1:31:38] of that day still feel unreal even now
[1:31:44] but there is something I didn't share
[1:31:46] before because I couldn't find the word
[1:31:49] to describe it the atmosphere I felt
[1:31:54] when the police officer allowed me to
[1:31:57] come into the building it was a great
[1:32:01] and fearful ush it was frightening my
[1:32:05] husband was there lying lifeless on the
[1:32:09] floor but the atmosphere around was so
[1:32:13] reverent it was like a
[1:32:16] unseen presiding being that demanded
[1:32:20] reverence at the time I thought I must
[1:32:24] have been imagining it but when I
[1:32:26] observed the action of the police
[1:32:29] officers I knew that they must have felt
[1:32:32] that present too they were respectful
[1:32:36] and spoke softly I know police officers
[1:32:41] are trained to do their job in a
[1:32:43] respectful manner but this was more than
[1:32:46] that from the way they conducted
[1:32:50] themselves I know that they were
[1:32:53] conscious
[1:32:54] of this Majestic presence too I looked
[1:32:58] at my husband's face and I saw rest it
[1:33:03] was so calm the coroner took him away
[1:33:07] with great care and not like it was
[1:33:11] another day's work my daughter and I
[1:33:14] both noticed the police officer standing
[1:33:18] in the lobby had tears in his eyes he
[1:33:21] has never met my husband but yet he shed
[1:33:25] tears like the brothers and the sisters
[1:33:29] standing on the pavement outside of the
[1:33:32] church the singing and praying outside
[1:33:36] the church it was so moving it echoed
[1:33:39] the presence I was feeling inside the
[1:33:43] church I felt the love from the
[1:33:46] Believers
[1:33:48] outside I felt so honored to be
[1:33:51] identified with them Peter would have
[1:33:55] been so proud of LCA the departure of my
[1:34:01] husband in my
[1:34:03] estimation is the closest thing I can
[1:34:06] see of being raptured he was Fit and
[1:34:10] Well he didn't even have so much as a
[1:34:13] headache that day he was just taken up
[1:34:17] God is a reality one to be feared and
[1:34:21] Obey you can't argue with God if there
[1:34:25] was one scripture that captur the man
[1:34:30] Peter Chandler was it would be first
[1:34:33] Peter 5:
[1:34:35] 2-4 feed the flock of God which is among
[1:34:38] you taking the oversight thereof not by
[1:34:41] constraint but willingly not for filthy
[1:34:44] Luca but of a ready mind neither is
[1:34:48] being Lords over God's Heritage but
[1:34:50] being examples to the flock and when the
[1:34:53] chief sheer shall appear ye shall
[1:34:55] receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not
[1:34:58] away it is perhaps the description of a
[1:35:02] gracious servant but that's what he was
[1:35:05] he had acquired dignity his strength did
[1:35:10] not come from his position it came from
[1:35:15] his humility and obedience to the word
[1:35:18] everywhere he preached whether at home
[1:35:22] or abroad are on the broadcast he never
[1:35:26] used that platform to speak about
[1:35:28] himself he repeated what the prophet
[1:35:31] spoke that Pulpit is older than my
[1:35:36] children and many of the ministers that
[1:35:39] are standing behind it it has stood
[1:35:42] there longer than many of our church
[1:35:46] members I have witness so many people
[1:35:50] give their hearts to Christ at the base
[1:35:53] of that Pulpit if that Pulpit had a
[1:35:57] voice it could tell you the history of
[1:36:00] our church for brother Peter it was a
[1:36:04] sacred desk let us not forget the great
[1:36:09] example left by him he was an innovator
[1:36:13] an extremely learned man he study at the
[1:36:17] highest levels but he used his life to
[1:36:20] serve the Son of God came into this
[1:36:24] world as a servant not as a master like
[1:36:29] a Pioneer and Beacon he pressed forward
[1:36:32] for God beating a path for others to
[1:36:35] follow he said he was not afraid of
[1:36:38] dying he knew he was going to Glory when
[1:36:43] I told him to slow down or take a break
[1:36:46] he would tell me let me live dine that
[1:36:50] was one of his phrases he demonstrated
[1:36:54] the virtues he preached he lived his
[1:36:57] values you know he never missed a Sunday
[1:37:00] in church or family never had family
[1:37:03] holidays he did not take holidays he had
[1:37:07] perfect attendance the day after he had
[1:37:10] a kidney stone removed he was at church
[1:37:14] at his post of Duty he preached through
[1:37:18] B's py he took care of himself so that
[1:37:22] he could take care of his father's
[1:37:24] business his heart beat for Christ no
[1:37:28] matter how busy things got he always
[1:37:32] make time for the people he cared about
[1:37:36] in both his family and his spiritual
[1:37:39] family everyone who knew him knows how
[1:37:43] proud he was of the people he loved of
[1:37:47] his children their families and his
[1:37:51] grandchildren we his natural family feel
[1:37:56] is absent deeply but we are consoled by
[1:38:00] his spiritual family the LCA family is
[1:38:04] well trained in conduct order and
[1:38:08] Doctrine and we are following an
[1:38:11] excellent example his legacy is love
[1:38:16] unconditional love there's been
[1:38:18] countless
[1:38:20] tributes expressing affection and
[1:38:23] respect I tried to respond to all of
[1:38:27] them but there were just so many I want
[1:38:29] to take this
[1:38:31] opportunity to thank those wellwishers
[1:38:34] for their uplifting and encouraging
[1:38:37] words on behalf of myself and the entire
[1:38:41] Chandler family I want to thank all of
[1:38:44] those who have supported Peter in so
[1:38:48] many different ways bringing him coffees
[1:38:52] and peppers and little goodies the
[1:38:54] beautiful drawings from the children to
[1:38:57] all the officers that worked with him
[1:39:00] and the Believers of
[1:39:02] LCA God bless you when I was 24 I
[1:39:07] started preaching this message we
[1:39:09] started originally in 1976 in a very
[1:39:12] small way and a very sort of humble way
[1:39:16] just in a uh a little labor
[1:39:18] hall had prayer there I feel very
[1:39:21] privileged to be in the message of this
[1:39:24] hour and when I look and realize the
[1:39:27] immensity of the message the validity of
[1:39:30] the message and the Vindication of the
[1:39:33] message I feel very privileged to be
[1:39:35] called and to know exactly where I'm
[1:39:37] standing to the Believers around the
[1:39:39] world that might be watching this I
[1:39:41] would say take courage as Joshua said be
[1:39:45] very courageous because this message
[1:39:49] Can't Fail uh because the message itself
[1:39:52] is indicating and the message is um as
[1:39:57] the word says that it shall not return
[1:39:59] void it might be somebody watching this
[1:40:02] video that is discouraged or um feeling
[1:40:06] like leaving I would say to them don't
[1:40:08] do it stay with the word it shall bring
[1:40:12] forth what it said it would and it's
[1:40:15] like a seed a seed that is planted will
[1:40:18] possess the gates of the enemy don't
[1:40:20] doubt it will come to pass
[1:40:27] [Applause]

[1:55:29] adultery he said I don't condemn you
[1:55:32] that's right go and sin no

[1:55:58] in a certain circumstance and if that
[1:56:00] same circumstance arise again he's got
[1:56:02] to act the second time like he did the
[1:56:04] first time or he's

[2:12:27] is love one for another and don't forget
[2:12:30] God's behavior is this person oh praise
[2:12:34] God hallelujah so the prophet said the
[2:12:38] Capstone come like a magnet and you know
[2:12:42] one time I wanted to get uh like a bag
[2:12:45] and put magnet in it put some things in

[2:12:53] those that have the magnetism in them
[2:12:55] that's right will get caught
[2:12:56] up you could rest the magnet on this bag
[2:12:59] with nothing in it it's not going to
[2:13:02] rise see therefore the Rapture is not
[2:13:04] outside
[2:13:05] in the Rapture is inside out what God
[2:13:09] common is not you is what inside of
[2:13:15] you yes sir once it inside of you you

[2:13:20] you're going in the rapture I'm going to
[2:13:21] make it I'm going to no you have to go
[2:13:24] because he coming for something inside
[2:13:25] of you he put it in you that when the
[2:13:27] maget come and pull you up glory to God
[2:13:31] Hallelujah the magnetism of the Holy
[2:13:35] Ghost brother said cause the strength of

[2:26:09] after brotherly kindness in the pyramid
[2:26:10] is Holy Spirit that's right and have the
[2:26:12] love right so you have to be called out
[2:26:15] into that atmosphere there what is not
[2:26:17] calling you and making you in the church
[2:26:19] ages is calling you out into a spirit
[2:26:21] atmosphere that's right that the Holy
[2:26:23] Spirit can come down because God cannot
[2:26:26] come down and dry no that why they were
[2:26:28] worshiping The Upper Room when you're
[2:26:30] dead God can't come down and that the
[2:26:33] worst thing to pray for is a person that
[2:26:34] dead at the altar Hallelujah you're
[2:26:36] praying for them
[2:26:39] Hallelujah Glory when somebody pressing
[2:26:42] Lord Jesus and they're praying and
[2:26:43] you're praying with them there's an
[2:26:44] atmosphere that is there that's right
[2:26:46] but if you pray for somebody that stone
[2:26:48] dead at the altar you get dead too they
[2:26:49] will kill you
[2:26:52] so the Holy Spirit needs an atmosphere
[2:26:56] so in the upper room they will
[2:26:57] worshiping Hallelujah Glory Glory
[2:26:59] Glory so it create an atmosphere like
[2:27:02] how the prophet say you got to do
[2:27:03] something for something happen he take a
[2:27:05] rock and thr it up in here and when it
[2:27:07] come down start to bring
[2:27:08] us and then a whirlwind start off
[2:27:12] judgment striking West Coast yes sir you

[2:27:24] bride and will cement you and you will
[2:27:26] see why you must be cemented that's
[2:27:28] right Bible call it the charity the bond
[2:27:30] of perfectness he said because with all
[2:27:33] these virtues there could be leaks leaks

[2:27:41] Lord make it trip you almost and it just
[2:27:43] leak out but when charity the P of

[2:28:36] that and he said Mommy I did not cheat I
[2:28:38] did the exam and they give me
[2:28:40] 1440 so then he started tell himself
[2:28:42] suppose I'm bright because he know he
[2:28:44] wasn't so bright he said but suppose I'm
[2:28:45] bright and he begin to have bright
[2:28:48] friends and talk to them and go to
[2:28:49] college and then later on life he could
[2:28:51] become very successful success
[2:28:53] businessman 10 years later the S people
[2:28:57] sent him a letter and told him because
[2:28:59] he said since he got that results his
[2:29:01] life changed because he recognized he
[2:29:03] could be bright and you know he's
[2:29:04] changed his life and so on 10 years
[2:29:06] later they sent him and tell him they
[2:29:08] made an
[2:29:11] error they sent it to the wrong people
[2:29:14] and his store was
[2:29:16] 743 it's too late
[2:29:20] right right his mind already
[2:29:23] changed and put him on a different
[2:29:28] trajectory so that half score that
[2:29:31] didn't qualify him that he that that his
[2:29:34] mind already changed and when your mind
[2:29:36] change you can't unchange
[2:29:38] [Applause]

[2:29:55] you could break out if you think it
[2:29:57] could be transformed you can be
[2:29:58] transformed Oh Glory to I can prove to

[2:30:09] you oh give the Lord a
[2:30:12] shout you can take this back with
[2:30:18] you almost done W
[2:30:20] [Music]
[2:30:22] Hallelujah I almost done skip a lot
[2:30:28] things all right
[2:30:31] see brother
[2:30:33] bam they ask brother Bram how can you
[2:30:36] believe these things the way you do and
[2:30:38] still go to the Assemblies of God
[2:30:40] Oneness all the rest he said brotherly
[2:30:43] kindness amen hoping someday amen
[2:30:47] patience with them that's right
[2:30:48] temperance that's right and drawing with
[2:30:51] them knowledge to understand what he
[2:30:53] believes corre and to know it's in his
[2:30:55] heart yes sir virtue in yourself to let
[2:30:59] it go up with kindness meekness to him
[2:31:02] having faith that someday God will bring
[2:31:05] him
[2:31:06] inen that's right
[2:31:10] Hallelujah so he was showing that these
[2:31:13] virtues is being
[2:31:14] exercised in sight of him if God didn't
[2:31:18] give him the experience of the people
[2:31:19] carrying on in the church and of the
[2:31:21] woman that he condemned because this
[2:31:22] ending of the story he went to the woman
[2:31:24] and said woman I was just condemning you
[2:31:27] and the Lord show me about my sins
[2:31:29] that's right and I want and she said
[2:31:30] brother Bram I thought I had no hope she
[2:31:32] said there is hope for you and he kneel
[2:31:35] on there with her in that room and got
[2:31:37] her back to the
[2:31:41] Lord so let's pull back the c a bit sir
[2:31:44] and see what God is seeing God is seeing
[2:31:47] that's a daughter of Minds that's right
[2:31:49] trapped

[2:31:53] mine that is condemning her his name is

[2:31:59] that's right I need to get
[2:32:01] somebody to

[2:32:07] the principes some man have to go
[2:32:10] somebody have to witness somebody have
[2:32:12] to
[2:32:14] testify so by him going in all humility
[2:32:17] he could have walk out the bar and walk
[2:32:18] out but he knew he had to tell that
[2:32:20] woman something he was challenged to do
[2:32:23] that and he went and do it I was
[2:32:26] condemning you and I was wrong the God
[2:32:29] that I serve show me that's not the way
[2:32:33] oh glory to God the love came down into

[2:33:13] caping stone brotherly kindness now what
[2:33:16] does it do they are waiting for the
[2:33:18] headstone which is love for God is love
[2:33:21] and he controls and he's the strength of
[2:33:23] every one of these things the holy
[2:33:25] spirit is above this welling this
[2:33:27] together building a what a perfect
[2:33:29] church for the for for for the Capstone
[2:33:32] that's right to cap off amen and when a
[2:33:34] man or woman possesses this which is all
[2:33:37] the virtues then the Capstone comes down
[2:33:40] and seals them into the kingdom of God
[2:33:44] and then you are living example of of
[2:33:46] Christianity that's right brotherly
[2:33:48] kindness I going to skip that Hallelujah
[2:33:50] now brotherly kindness then love being
[2:33:52] the Capstone and all this is tempered
[2:33:55] together by the Holy Spirit now that is
[2:33:58] what it takes to become a servant of
[2:34:01] Christ amen Christ builds his church in
[2:34:05] the seven Church ages his bride a person
[2:34:07] a woman a church seven Church ages
[2:34:09] constitute to make the bride and so on
[2:34:11] like that remember this morning these
[2:34:14] virtues has to be in there before the
[2:34:17] Capstone will even Comon it oh praise
[2:34:20] the Lord so Jesus proved he was the
[2:34:22] right kind of son I say say let me say
[2:34:25] this if you can't me a fanatic from this
[2:34:27] night on that very thing that I'm
[2:34:29] speaking of will be done there will be a
[2:34:31] power put into the church and now it's
[2:34:33] coming in and the Holy Spirit Will so
[2:34:34] anoint the people till they will speak
[2:34:37] the word yes sir and Flash like and will
[2:34:39] shut them out in something like that all
[2:34:42] right then we know that uh somebody
[2:34:44] spoke in tongues and there was
[2:34:45] interpretation and the interpretation
[2:34:47] was this because thou has chosen the
[2:34:48] Narrow Path yeah the harder way that was
[2:34:51] walked of your own choosing that's right
[2:34:53] and that is where it must be your choice
[2:34:55] love is a choice sir not a
[2:34:59] feeling
[2:35:02] say God's love is not parental love
[2:35:05] God's love is elective love so he can
[2:35:08] send you through the fire he can send
[2:35:09] you through the hard trials because he
[2:35:11] Lov you because he elected you God is
[2:35:14] Not
[2:35:15] Human like grandparents I'm a
[2:35:17] grandparent I love my grandchildren but
[2:35:19] that's not love God has his love is
[2:35:21] called elective love his love rebukes
[2:35:24] his love corrects his love
[2:35:27] instructs that is love right yes sir
[2:35:32] Hallelujah because I was chosen a narrow
[2:35:34] path the Hardway that was walked of your
[2:35:36] own choosing yes sir in other words I
[2:35:38] didn't have to do it I Conde with the
[2:35:40] other of them but I stayed with the word
[2:35:42] th was picked the correct and precise
[2:35:44] decision it is my way watch he says this
[2:35:47] in it what a glorious decision thou has
[2:35:50] made this in itself is that which will
[2:35:53] make and come to pass the tremendous
[2:35:56] victory in the love divine amen and I'm
[2:36:00] closing yes sir so listen to this right
[2:36:03] now we have a perfect standing by the
[2:36:06] blood that's right when God look through
[2:36:08] the blood he see us perfect but our
[2:36:11] state is not perfect corre we feel down
[2:36:13] we feel depressed that's our state but
[2:36:16] by way of the blood we are perfect
[2:36:18] because when God look down
[2:36:20] he seen us through the
[2:36:22] blood do you understand that even if the
[2:36:25] devil is accusing about your life Jesus
[2:36:27] I die for them I pay the price for
[2:36:30] them the accuser that's why I last time
[2:36:33] I here I said don't accuse one another
[2:36:35] because you are not Lucifer he is the
[2:36:37] accuser of the
[2:36:38] Brethren don't accuse let Lucifer do the
[2:36:41] accusing Christ is doing the pleading
[2:36:44] because he's our
[2:36:45] lawyer isn't that right watch this so
[2:36:49] there for Faith say this so that that
[2:36:52] perfect standing by the blood but the
[2:36:54] perfect state will come by
[2:36:56] charity when charity comes you'll have a
[2:36:59] perfect State Hallelujah when brother
[2:37:01] Brandon was on the platform and a woman
[2:37:03] come up and she BN something there she
[2:37:04] said that's okay that's just his
[2:37:06] presence to charity was all around
[2:37:11] him as an invisible force feel they not
[2:37:15] start TR now this real

[2:37:58] pictures Pi we do fine but BR I'd rather
[2:38:02] have a church listen a moment I would
[2:38:04] rather have a church that knows nothing
[2:38:06] about any spiritual gift and just be so
[2:38:09] in love with each other amen and with
[2:38:11] Christ that's right I rather have that
[2:38:14] than every spiritual gift operating in
[2:38:17] the church
[2:38:19] now that might sound hard in a
[2:38:21] Pentecostal group but I rather have it
[2:38:24] where there is gifts they will fail
[2:38:26] where there is gifts it bring confusion
[2:38:28] where there is gifts they can be
[2:38:29] questioned but where there is love it is
[2:38:31] perfect that's right and if you had
[2:38:34] perfect love you would have perfect
[2:38:37] gifts so work first with love and that
[2:38:41] brings fellowship and fellowship bring
[2:38:46] giftsall that's good isn't that
[2:38:48] beautiful
[2:38:50] work with love first and that brings
[2:38:55] Fellowship that's right and fellowship

[2:39:16] glorious day that all the gifts that's
[2:39:18] in the church will be set aside on a
[2:39:20] mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit
[2:39:22] himself will just take the church in
[2:39:24] such a control of divine love until the
[2:39:27] sick will be healed the blind will see
[2:39:29] the lame will walk without hands being
[2:39:33] laid on them it will be a one great
[2:39:37] Unity
[2:39:39] Hallelujah he this the people they lie

[2:39:44] bond of security to B $5 from somebody
[2:39:47] you know the Bible speaks of that
[2:39:50] there'll be no love in the last days but
[2:39:53] just among the elect
[2:39:55] [Applause]
[2:39:56] people that's right the scripture say
[2:39:59] husband would be against wife wife
[2:40:00] against husband children against parents

[2:40:18] 13 yes and the Amplified are we going to
[2:40:22] close sorry this is the
[2:40:25] Amplified if I can speak in tongues of
[2:40:27] men and angels and have not love that
[2:40:30] reasoning intentional spiritual devotion
[2:40:33] such as inspired by God's love and in us
[2:40:36] I'm only a noisy gong correct a clanging
[2:40:39] symbol exactly if I have prophetic
[2:40:41] Powers the gift of interpreting the
[2:40:44] Divine will and purpose and understand
[2:40:47] all the secret truths and M trees and
[2:40:50] possess all knowledge and if I have
[2:40:52] sufficient Faith so I can remove
[2:40:54] mountains but have not love God loving
[2:40:56] me I am nothing a useless nobody exactly
[2:41:01] even if I do out all that I have to the
[2:41:03] poor in providing food if I Surrender my
[2:41:06] body to be burned or in order that I may
[2:41:08] glory and have not the love of God in Me
[2:41:11] I gain
[2:41:12] nothing love endures
[2:41:15] long and is patient and kind love is
[2:41:19] never in Envy us nor boils over with
[2:41:23] jealousy is not boastful or vain
[2:41:26] glorious does not display itself hly it
[2:41:30] is not conceited arrogant inflated with
[2:41:33] pride it is not rude unmanly does not
[2:41:37] act
[2:41:38] unbecomingly love does not insist on its
[2:41:41] own rights or its own way for it is not
[2:41:45] self-seeking it is not touchy fretful or
[2:41:48] resentful
[2:41:49] it takes no account of evil done to it
[2:41:53] it pays no attention to suffer WR it
[2:41:56] does not rejoice at Injustice and
[2:41:58] righteousness but rejoice when right and
[2:42:01] Truth Prevail right love bears up under
[2:42:04] anything and everything and come that
[2:42:07] comes it is ever ready to believe the
[2:42:10] best in every person that's right its
[2:42:12] hopes are fadeless under all
[2:42:15] circumstances it endures everything
[2:42:17] without weakness amen love never fails
[2:42:20] never never Fades out or becomes
[2:42:23] obsolete or comes to an end as a
[2:42:26] prophecy or the gift of interpreting the
[2:42:28] Divine will and purpose it will be
[2:42:30] fulfilled and pass away as for tongues
[2:42:32] it will be destroyed and ceased as for
[2:42:34] knowledge it will pass away it will lose
[2:42:36] its value and be superseded by truth for
[2:42:39] our knowledge is fragmentary incomplete
[2:42:41] and imperfect and our prophecy our
[2:42:43] teaching is fragmentary incomplete and
[2:42:45] imperfect but when the complete and
[2:42:47] perfect total comes the incomplete and
[2:42:50] imperfect will vanish away all right
[2:42:53] become Antiquated void and superseded
[2:42:55] when I was a child I talk like a child I
[2:42:58] thought like a child I reason like a
[2:43:00] child now that I have become a man I am
[2:43:03] done away with childish way and I've put
[2:43:05] them aside and now we are looking in a
[2:43:08] mirror sir that GS only a dim blurred
[2:43:10] reflection of reality as a riddle or
[2:43:13] Enigma but then when Perfection comes we
[2:43:16] shall see in reality and face to face
[2:43:19] now I know in part imperfectly but then
[2:43:21] I shall know and understand fully and
[2:43:24] clearly even in the same manner as I
[2:43:26] have been fully and clearly known and
[2:43:28] understood by God so now faith hope hope
[2:43:32] love abide Faith conviction and belief
[2:43:34] respecting man's relation to God and
[2:43:36] divine things hope joyful and confident
[2:43:38] expectation true affection for God and
[2:43:41] man growing out of the love of God in us
[2:43:43] these three but the greatest of Jus love
[2:43:47] amen last scripture done we going to
[2:43:49] play something praise God there some

[2:49:52] tonight um before I pray I just want to

[2:49:58] um I want to thank you all the local
[2:50:01] assembly J London for the honor you did
[2:50:04] to brother Peter Chandler the funeral
[2:50:08] service I've been in quite a few funeral
[2:50:10] services in our church at of our church
[2:50:14] in my country as my
[2:50:16] country and that's not saying words
[2:50:19] I can't remember being a service as
[2:50:24] outstanding as what we had on Monday for
[2:50:27] brother
[2:50:33] Peter and so I want to thank you for the
[2:50:36] great honor you did to brother
[2:50:39] Peter truth be told I still feel so
[2:50:43] pained and I know you feel the same way
[2:50:46] because um it's now that we are
[2:50:50] realizing brother Peter is no longer
[2:50:52] here and I just want to leave you a word
[2:50:55] here I number the Peter since
[2:50:59] 1981 and he
[2:51:02] labored he labored for this church when
[2:51:06] the church was in heon's Hall all the
[2:51:08] way down to the years he
[2:51:11] labored and if there's anything about
[2:51:13] brother Peter brother Benham said that
[2:51:15] live so that when you pass on the
[2:51:20] preacher doesn't have to tell lies about
[2:51:23] you it's so easy to say ni about brother
[2:51:28] Peter because that's who he was he was
[2:51:31] just a fine Christian and a fine human
[2:51:35] being and I
[2:51:41] would
[2:51:42] and my testimony about the funeral
[2:51:45] service and the sweet atmosphere we
[2:51:49] in the service at the reception is just
[2:51:52] a thorough reflection of who brother
[2:51:53] Peter himself was Anonymous there one
[2:51:57] and I've never and brother Theo said it
[2:51:59] first and I mean I mean publicly I mean
[2:52:02] when he sent his testimony in but
[2:52:04] Frankly Speaking is something that
[2:52:06] anyone in brother Peter will say like
[2:52:07] brother benam was said of him you do not
[2:52:10] know his friends from his enemies that's
[2:52:13] who brother Peter was and the Swit
[2:52:15] Spirit at the reception at the service
[2:52:19] was just a reflection of who he was it
[2:52:21] couldn't be any other way you couldn't
[2:52:23] know his friends from his enemies and
[2:52:26] everybody was there whoever it was and
[2:52:28] it was just a sweet Spirit of love and
[2:52:30] my admonition would just be Church
[2:52:33] please stay that way amen please stay
[2:52:36] that way the greatest thing we can do
[2:52:37] for brother Peter in in to salute his
[2:52:40] memory to honor his memory is just to
[2:52:44] stay that way stay a church full of love
[2:52:47] like brother the pre tonight to be the
[2:52:50] cement that will glue this church
[2:52:53] together stay together and above all I
[2:52:58] want to say to you sister Monica the
[2:53:01] family please take care of them amen
[2:53:04] sister Monica I known her s new brother
[2:53:07] Peter she was there by his side through
[2:53:10] thick and thin and it's not the time to
[2:53:12] go into all of those things but she went
[2:53:15] through a lot with him that's true and
[2:53:17] sister Monica want to say thank you
[2:53:19] again for the strength you gave all of
[2:53:21] us
[2:53:26] because
[2:53:28] because very few very few men or women
[2:53:33] not just sisters even Brothers will find
[2:53:37] it difficult to find the
[2:53:40] strength that she exhibited it was on
[2:53:44] the 12th of April 2 days after that she
[2:53:47] gave that stearing testimon here with
[2:53:49] the family and that's what comforted all
[2:53:52] of us all over the world Monica I want
[2:53:54] to say thank you thank you for standing
[2:53:57] by Brother Peter and thank you for
[2:53:59] comforting us because brother Peter I
[2:54:01] can assure you I mean maybe because you
[2:54:03] here but brother Peter was loved
[2:54:05] everywhere I mean you know that but he
[2:54:07] was loved everywhere and in my group it
[2:54:10] was tough but when s Monica's testimony
[2:54:12] came on it lift many people told me
[2:54:14] that's what lifted up the sorrow and the
[2:54:16] pain from their hearts say mon thank you

[2:54:31] say again the greatest Legacy we can

[2:54:40] enemies let's take together let's honor
