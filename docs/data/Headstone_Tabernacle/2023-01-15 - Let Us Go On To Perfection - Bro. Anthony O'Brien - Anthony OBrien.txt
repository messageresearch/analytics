privilege to be here for a title for my message this morning let us go on to perfection my subject is the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me and I have an inspiration a kind of an inspiration One More River to Cross amen Hallelujah glory to God and that river is as we know is Jordan Jordan means separation isn't that right death to self and when the children of Israel were coming out of Egypt praise God they they had crossed the Red Sea they had come true Long Journeys they have met many things they saw Mana Fall Out of Heaven praise God they uh saw the brass superint isn't that right they met the bitter Waters at mamre they saw different things but but but to get into the Promised Land they had one more River that they had to cross they had one more river that they had to go to and we've come a mighty long way this morning when we look back at 2022 and 2021 and 2020 how God brought us through how God preserved our lives from destruction how God kept us kept our feet from falling kept our hearts from failing for fear there was a confidence that God putting us to press the battle pray to press the charge Hallelujah it is a great hour of charge this morning and there's a people here that rise to their occasion but I'm here to tell you this morning that despite what you face despite what you've gone through we still got one more River to Cross oh one more challenge one more battle of fights one more prayer to pray one more press the press one more Victory to win oh how we are almost to the top oh many sages man any prophets wish that they could be here this morning to shout the way you shout and to dance the way you dance and to claim what you are claiming this morning oh but they without us are not made perfect God has given you something this morning to bring you to Perfection oh Hallelujah we know in part and we prophesy in Parts but we're not talking about pot this morning we're not talking about gospel Luther had pop gospel Wesley had pop gospel the Pentecostals had a part of itch what I'm talking about this morning is let us go on to Perfection let us go on to adoption let us go honor to the breaking Hallelujah oh into this eternal Church age that we are called to a briding you're called out to be in that age call out of laodicea to fit into that Holy Spirit slot let us go on to Perfection oh hallelujah praise God so I feel this morning that since last Sunday a declaration is being made in the spirit that's what I picked up in my spirit and all week I was kind of thinking about it thinking about it and I wasn't able to kind of put anything down but uh and I got a real battle because the devil came in my body and started fighting me I didn't have a voice up till Friday Saturday so I'm here this morning by the grace of almighty God amen praise God and so uh just fighting like that amen and just wondering and asking Lord what should I do what should I do here see and all of a sudden 11 o'clock one night bam the water come back and it was gosh after gosh amen so I have this inspiration here now based on that and so this is what God gave me to preach you this morning amen so I pray that it'd be a blessing to you amen amen so I have a thought here when God calls call to Perfection right God is calling us I heard someone say one time a ringing phone must be answered when your phone ringing somebody calling in sometimes you might be able to answer it but you know it's ringing and it's on your mind and it's on your heart you might be in a meeting or it might be in a bank or you might be unable to take the call but if the call is coming through if you realize that a call is coming through it's on your mind it's on your heart and God is calling us this morning because there's a call that he put in your heart and you've got to answer that call this morning only you can answer that call because he's not called and he may not be calling the person next to you but you know he's calling you he may not be calling many people but he's calling you this morning out of billions on the earth going about doing their own thing about their own program but you know in your heart that God is calling you no matter where you go no matter what you do when God calls you've got to answer no matter how long it takes God's phone line is always ringing until you pick up that phone he said behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man answer the door if any man opened the door oh Hallelujah he'll come in there he'll speak with you sometimes you just gotta give God a little time to let him talk to you let him Hallelujah talk to you on the other line cause he wants to tell you something he wants to tell you how wonderful you are he wants to tell you how Glory what glory is inside of you he wants to tell you what promises that he has made for you he wants to tell you that he wants to heal you he wants to deliver you he wants to restore you he wants to do something for you oh but you gotta answer that call this morning do you leave it I believe with all my heart that God is calling us today we have received the call just like John received a call hello is there a journalism waiting around is that right in the spirit when all of a sudden he heard a call come up hither I've got something to show you I've got something to reveal to you but I can't show it to you down there you've got to come up here and very seldom does the call of God allow you to stay where you are you gotta come up where God is God's not gonna stay down there in your atmosphere you got to rise up you've got to stand up you've got to acknowledge God you've got to respond quickly to the spirit when he calls you because if you don't respond you could miss it don't miss it this morning get out of litachy get out of laziness get out of thoughtfulness get out of slackness in your mind God is Not slack concerning his promise like some men count slackness get up and stand up this morning and say Amen to the word of God get up and praise God get up and do something about your salvation before you miss your day of visitation get up and praise God get up in your spirit wake up in your soul get on fire for God oh Hallelujah rather you hot are you cold but get on fire for God or get out now because we're going foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God is called a church out of Jacob's Grace into Joseph perfection Perfection is what is required and when Perfection is required you can't get away with flaws it's no longer admissible error is no longer admissible because that was just perfect has come when that is being presented before you you are now responsible for what is being presented you have to now answer a high Accord and that's where we're at now we're approaching that hour now a glorious Church without spot without wrinkle that is seamless well ironed comment clothed in white praising the name of our God out of every Kindred a nation and tongue John saw them well is that right oh waving palm branches Hosanna Hosanna this song a new song oh hello is that right Hallelujah out of every Church change God's calling a bride he's calling one today just as sure as he did back then but this one will not see death this one will come to Perfection and bring up the dead in Christ amen then upper come Luther upper come Wesley up welcome brother Branham hallelujah oh he said I'll meet you in the morning pray what's he talking about a resurrection call he's waiting on you to come to perfection to bring up the sleeping Saints isn't that right so there's no room for error no room the spirit of error there's no room for that just like there was no room for the dragon when he was kicked out of heaven the Bible said there was no room found for him amen there was no room for slackness no room for lies no room for lust no room for any error appraisal isn't that right no room for human interpretations no room for other stories or other versions of God's word there's no room for that color that was kicked out of heaven and just as that was kicked out of heaven we are kicking it out down here too because we are agents hallelujah hallelujah of God's kingdom and we represent God here on Earth Hallelujah and as it is in heaven so shall it be on the edge Hallelujah and whatever you find under Heaven is whatever you lose in heaven is loose on Earth God's gonna give you power and authority to lock up the devil and to lose hallelujah oh Hallelujah the spirit of God glory to God hallelujah but you've got to come to perfection in order to see that kind of Power released email it's not right First Corinthians 13 says do I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am because a sounding brass and a tingling simple just a noise just uh just a a a attack flapper that's what you are isn't that right make a lot of a lot of people making a lot of noise in this time yeah it's not right and they have platforms to do it on too they do it on Facebook on YouTube they have access to all kinds of stuff to make sounding brass and to make plenty tingling symbols oh but no charity anyway isn't that right we've got to come to that praise God that is the mark for the price of the high calling that we have to press towards otherwise we just wasting time otherwise we're just making circles in the deserts but this morning I hear a voice I hear a call this morning turn ye not to us and possess a land that God sworn to your fathers Hallelujah to possess hey possess what you know is your own [Applause] [Music] and don't occupy space it's easy to do that people just take up churches people just occupy in space just sitting in places and with aimless and almost a message has almost come that way amen but uh for a lack of Revelation for the people to understand what they have to possess what God has revealed in this last day that if we are to go to a Rapture there is a condition for that Jesus is coming back for the same kind of a church that he had when it was here when he was here he's coming back for that kind of church oh where the holy ghost moving in it another book of Acts that's the kind of church he's coming back for he's not coming back for a dead lazy bunch of moss back don't want to pray don't want to cry out no fervency no I'll spew you out of my mouth God's looking for you to get on fire get next to yourself come on now come on now Hallelujah come on now Amen brother Batiste that's what we're looking for years we go in a church but sirs we would see Jesus yes we come into the message yes we open in scripture but we want to see Messiah made known in his own word Messiah manifested among the people hallelujah oh oh brother we gonna be Messiahs brother Branham called us Messiahs little anointed ones because Messiah means anointed one but in this age is not a one-man Ministry it's many members bodied Hallelujah of Jesus Christ Glory some over here some over there here's my spirit flowing freely here's another one I could use Messiah of the kingdom of God that's who he's calling this morning let us go on to perfection oh can we give Lord a shout of praise yeah man [Applause] all right no I have to pace myself because like I said my voice is on an expiry date all right so uh but God bless you man I appreciate the faith amen praise God I feel a fire this morning amen so God bless you amen so we will be First Corinthians 13. and although I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith that I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing oh my no matter what you have or claim to have you've got to cross the finish line huh you've got to cross the finish line you've got to get to charity that's absolute isn't that right amen and do I restore my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have no charity it profited me nothing charity suffer it long and it's kind charity Envy it not charity wanted not itself it is not puffed up oh this is a character of Christ now this this is the nature of Christ shining through being operated by love the Capstone coming down into every virtue and reflecting a part of the rainbow if you need a little godliness he reflects that if you need Temperance he reflects that if he needs some forgiveness he comes down reflects that praise God Indigo Holland that vial at praise that right oh man charity he said the dog does not behave itself unseemingly oh my my you feel good on a Sunday but but coming through the weekend feel feel a little bit unseemingly when the test comes when the trial comes when the push comes to the shove you feel a little unseemingly oh Hallelujah that's because you don't have charity yet but you're pressing on to it this morning we are called to press on to charity so that we can learn to behave ourselves oh it's going to conduct ourselves as sons and then you shall be adopted into the family of God based on your behavior your conduct based on the test that's given you you can reflect these rainbows oh Hallelujah and be the right kind of a son oh the kind of sun that the father wants to run his business praise God because it's a serious business Hallelujah and you need serious people to run it he needs people to reflect his character to reflect his nature to reflect his being to be like he him on the Earth are representative and in order to be a representative you have to understand the goal the vision and the mission of the of the of the firm that you're working with of the company that you're representing isn't that right you have to look like it you have to walk like it you have to talk like it it have to be in your heart you can be faking it or because when the tests come when the push comes to the Shelf you better call it Hallelujah if you ain't got it then you've got it to catch oh hallibur you all gotta get it this morning oh Hallelujah before Jesus comes again yeah man behaving not unseemingly seek it not her own don't have your own devices or your own missions you're trying to fulfill sneakily trying to do it through the guys or through the platform of whatever it is isn't that right people have their own agendas they start off real good like so but they have their own agendas and if they don't have the character and the nature it takes for leadership or for power they usually fall off the wagon at some point in time but God needs you to be strong and to be of a good courage he needs you to follow to be totally surrendered in him that's how you get strong it's when you surrender oh it's when you give up your rights share all of your rights away it means shave it off it means tear it off it means tear off your old comments like like Elisha or how to rip up your own threads holla it's not a rip up what you think is good and what you think is nice all fleshes as grass oh how all of us is just filthiness there's none righteous this morning you cannot perfect yourself so get out of that this morning get out of that thinking you cannot perfect yourself and take God to perfect you and take Christ to perfect you so what you need to do is surrender oh Hallelujah there is non-righteous no not one [Applause] oh can I get a witness here [Applause] amen it's not easily provoked thinketh no evil amen is all right but Rejoice is not iniquity but rejoices in the truth bearing all things believe it all things hope in all things endure it all things charity never fail it but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge they shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come oh here's the scripture then that which is in touch shall be done away when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things we didn't come all this way in a message to continue as babies or to continue as children no no no no no no we come to feasts on the hidden manner we come to Feast on strong Meats because where the meat is they're where the egos are gonna be gathered together God is calling Eagles he is not calling chickens so rise up this morning in the newness of life and come to the eagle core there's a cry going out Hallelujah a call to perfection oh Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen oh yes sir [Applause] no more time for baby stuff acting as children our time is finished we've got to press on now to Perfection and put away childish things set your affections on things above the prophets let your pants like be bagged at the knees instead of talking about it why don't you pray about it put it before God about it and then let him take charge about it and control it it ain't in your hands no more give it up stop being a child you want to play with sharp knives give it up you want to play with all kinds of things that is not your own you want to hold on to grudges you want to hold on to odds you want to hold on to foolishness and carelessness we don't have time for that time is short oh ain't nobody got time for that it's time for you to grow up time for you to get next to yourself and begin to press your way to perfection oh Hallelujah are you hearing me this morning I need somebody who was not afraid to possess their Mountain to possess their inheritance or to possess their Gates oh hallelujah hallelujah there's a promise upon the seed of God God said that seed shall possess every gate of the enemy and when Jesus died he died to connect you to Abraham's Royal seed that means a promise upon the seed is upon you this morning you have been connected by the Royal bloodline of Jesus Christ himself to possess the enemy's Gates [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known oh you're gonna come into a state of knowingness oh

you're gonna come into that stage right now you might be in a temporary way but tell the devil this morning he is still working on me God is not finished with me yet all other arms is still being worked on oh Hallelujah isn't that right the master builder is still working on the project he hasn't closed off on it yet he might be silent he might not be doing anything right now he might look like he just standing still but he's watching your attitude he's watching you to see if you're gonna be consistent oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah foreign I learned recently there's a difference between consistency and intensity there are times in life when we have our intensity so that's like Crisis when things go wrong we get intense about it let's gather a team together let's sort this out let's fix this problem that's intensity but as soon as the problem is fixed you usually go back to the default setting to your regular scheduled program that's intensity there are times in life when you have intensity when there's need for an adrenaline rush but what I realized what more and more God wants is not just not intensity but a consistency of every day doing the will of God every day pressing every day striving every day praying a little bit lying upon line precept upon precept hear a little Fair little he told the children of Israel little by little you're gonna conquer the land oh it's unfolding this morning or little by little you're gonna conquer little by little as you claim a border maintain your ground keep the enemy off of it pray pluck up the weeds keep it fresh keep the grass green oh and when you're ready claim some more land then maintain it keep on moving just keep moving the prophet said until every fella take his place then you'll see the Church of God come into its Mighty power then you'll see another anania Center fire when the church Finds Its place in Christ oh you're gonna find a place friends oh hallelujah hallelujah perfection is what

praise God okay well it's called the Perfection hey man all right Prophet said Oneness no he said no no now the coming of the Lord is of Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment we know this quote and I feel it fits in here he said calling calling is elect together in Oneness with himself with the same kind of a Ministry he had he said you know how I shape the church ages here not too long ago about the big tower that was built called the pyramid but the headstone was never put on him he said and remember now the lutherans came and then the Wesley is in the minority then they come down to Pentecost and he said now what is he doing he said calling from that he said what did he do he called out the elect to make the Lutheran and then he called out the elect out of the lutherans isn't that right to make the Wesleyan then he called out the elect out of that to make the Pentecostal and now he's calling today the elect Pentecostals out to make the headstone to come into it amen a very same kind of a Ministry dropping right in on it calling his children oh that's you this morning from all denominations and from all walks of life God knew you in your grandmothers grandmother's grandmother's womb he knew you were coming and he's calling a church today to Perfection he knows your name this morning oh None Shall be left behind and None Shall be lost there's a call of God in your heart in your life this morning the very reason you are in this church the very reason you could hear the voice of God is because God put a receptor inside of your heart before the foundation of the world so that you can hear this call or you would never hear it but God predestinated you before the foundation of the world to hear the call of God in your life oh Hallelujah and what has he done he's placed them with true teachers true prophets who stay with his word amen the Bible said my sheep hear my voice said Jesus if that was his voice then it's his voice no it's the same once you stay with that tape stay with the word it's the same voice it's the same thing see anything contrary to that voice it's not cheap food Prophet said we'll Feast with the King to dine with his guests how blessed these pilgrims are oh how blessed am I this morning oh and God called me oh there many young men smoking weed right now and praise God they all messed up but God called me out of all of that

Hallelujah amen my my grandmother this year by the grace of God will be 101 years old I said wow look at that she was born in 1922. amen 10 120 22. well that's the grace of God because you just come through a pandemic and it could have been a different story but the grace of God isn't that right and one thing I was observing she was sitting looking at the news one time and I said wow she looked at that Newsday almost 100 years and see people dying on the news from murder and thief and robbery and young men getting caught up in all kinds of nonsense and she's turning a hundred on one by the grace of God if God spare life is not right and look at all kind of people come and go come and go and she's still there I said look at that I said only the grace of God I said that reminds me of God himself God see people come and go come and go people waste their time people claim to be so fervent and then all of a sudden they die out and get a little slack and lazy praise God some people keep on keeping on some people consistent praise God some people have a heart praise God but they just don't have the strength to get up there no God knows all about it he's been around a long time he's been watching you a long time he knows your heart he knows your struggle he knows your name God was a teenager one time so he know how it is to be a teenager God was a child one time so he knows how it is to be a child God was a young man one time and he knows how it is to be a young man but one day yeah he put away childish things and he became an adult and just as he became an adult 23 and a half years you're gonna become an adult in Christ knowing all things preparing all things believe in all things hoping all things just like he did hey that same kind of anointing same kind of presence will be upon you or you'll speak the word and it'll flash like lightning oh Hallelujah do you believe it this morning yeah many many men my praise God just an observation there praise God well all right what has he done play some true teachers right okay I was here feed him with the King see beholding his hallowed face of glow with love divine oh the prophet is worshiping here now he said bless particles of his grace as gems in his crown To Shine Jesus is coming soon our trials will then be over Hallelujah what if our Lord come for those who are free from sin then wouldn't it bring you Joy or sorrow or great despair but when all Lord and Glory comes we'll meet him up in the air oh Hallelujah yes sir he says praise the name of the Lord amen all right so this book of perfection is being done by God we are not perfecting ourselves we cannot perfect ourselves do you believe that they understand praise God praise God because I think sometimes we take it too hard on ourselves we take it out on others praise God expecting Perfection from others yeah yeah amen expecting others to be as our expectation when the reality is there's none perfect there's none without sin God died for us and set us free Hallelujah he paid for all or or salvation or Redemption he died for all perfecting praise God so that we can be perfected he made a way for Perfection when he died on that Cross isn't that right and when he died I was lost in sin I I didn't have a leg to stand on I couldn't defend myself I couldn't help myself but when he died he set me free he was beaten he was stripped he was cut he was bruised he screamed ouch he cried out he said my father forgive me but I forgive them but they don't know what they're doing he said father father oh why has Thou forsaken me he felt forsaken all he was paying for the Judgment of all your sin of all your filth of all your or unbelief he paid for all of that and he set you free and he let you go and he took it away from you and he didn't hold it against you he said not guilty oh oh we ought to praise God this morning because he set you free and now listen if that is how Christ died for me then what do I own question what do I own what do I have the rights to question can I hold a grudge question can I hold a ought against somebody when I know they probably don't know better praise God they did what they did praise God or whatever it was how can I have the right to hold a grudge to hold an ought against somebody understand what I'm saying this morning when Jesus died for me to set me free he didn't hold it against me so why should I hold it against you I don't have the right to even hold it [Applause] vengeance's mindset God oh he will deal with it oh you have a right to forgive you have a right to let it go that is what you are fighting for perfection [Applause] share all your rights away in this world of sin that's what that means people feel they have the right to be angry forever to be animosity and to be jealous or whatever forever isn't that right hallelujah it's not right God bless him but I forgiven a robot you see that but God that's what is in trouble God have to remove that but and God will keep selling hot Tire trials hot tests hot persecution he'll do what he have to do to get you to learn of him whatever it takes if he tried Moses he's gonna try you too if he tried Joseph he's gonna try you to if he tried David isn't that right but that's Stephen Oliver you know he talked about David on Friday oh I had David to pass through a long hard way the throne was always his the crown was always his but he had to go through some hard stuff he had to go through some hatred he had to go through some jealousy he had to go through some Envy he had to fight for his life he had to learn to take care of the man that he had under him because he had a kingdom to take care of later on oh Our God was training him on the back side of the deserts he trained him with a lion treat him with a bear getting him ready to meet his Goliath and even after Goliath he still had one more River to Cross Hallelujah it took a long time [Applause] Oh Glory Glory Glory God took the children of Israel to 40 Years of no illness some of them backslid some of them lost their lives but God was trying to get him to the promised land and if the elders didn't want church then God raised up a bunch of young people why because there's one more River to Cross oh it took a long time but God is finally getting a church ready to meet him in a Rapture to meet him in a great going home now I'm going up yonder let us go on to perfection whoa come on somebody don't faint now oh [Applause] [Music] amen this is not a time for giving up this is a time for holding on this is a time to stand with that word because God is hateful he is faithful that made a promise isn't that right Elijah and Elisha Elisha come true all the way Bethel kilga School little prophets Elijah knew the anointing he felt but he still had one more River to Cross oh hallelujah hallelujah come to better he come together the prophets of the school told him don't you know your master will be cut off from you today he said I know of it but hold your peace I know of it but don't worry about it I'm on a mission I don't know what mission you are on but I'm on a mission because I'm gonna get that double portion I've got to get Hollywood I came for I'm not taking off an answer as long as your spirit Hallelujah is alive as long as your soul is leading I'll not leave you Hallelujah I'm not leaving you until you bless me I'm not leaving you until you give me what I want until you give me what I need until you give me what I asked for Hallelujah [Applause] God is faithful he will perform it isn't that right the other day I had a little experience I was pulling a pen apart and there's a little ring inside of the pen that used to mount Depend and fell on the ground in the night and I couldn't see it I said Lord looking for the ring can't find it said Lord help me to find a ring after a while I got kind of tired and I said you know what it's getting late I'll go inside forget about the ring tiny little mechanism and one no one's in the road yeah cars passing all the time foreign so I come back the next day come out of the car open the door and as I look down there's the ring intact in the same condition it was when it when it left me I said look how in a simple thing look how fateful God is with them I asked him just to just to restore it to me I can't see I don't have the eyes to see I said Lord you helped me see and he was faithful enough to bring it right in front of my foot God is faithful if he is faithful in those little things just think about how much God will be faithful in your circumstance think about how much God is faithful in your situation oh Hallelujah he's faithful he's just waiting for you to have the right attitude sometimes because you say the right thing oh Hallelujah sometimes it's when you pray for your enemy instead of rejoicing for his fall that's when God's getting ready to bless you but he lets thing happen to see what you're going to do pray what are you gonna do about it oh Hallelujah sometimes I feel like we we you know we in a we're in a room and and God is looking at us through a two-way glass he's seeing you you can't see him amen amen but he sent this one to talk to you you send that one to talk to you ask some questions find out what happened on the night of this on the 9th of 16th amen and God is looking at you praise God to see what your answer is going to be because in that atmosphere he knows all things praise God he knows when he's going to bless you how he's going to bless you how it's going to unfold you don't have to worry about it you just keep on your eyes on the cross praise God cut your eyes off everybody else keep your eyes on Jesus Oh I pray for your brother pray for your sister they need help you need help we all need Jesus pray s God if your brother's struggling pray for him he needs Jesus you need Jesus I need Jesus we all need Jesus this morning it take Jesus to perfect us and take Jesus Hallelujah to bring us through this long way oh how about don't you worry you are going to cross that River this morning oh Hallelujah don't you worry about it God's got it figured out this morning amen oh Hallelujah praise God so we can't perfect ourselves right if God called somebody that was already perfect think about this then it would be by their mind and by their power that you would say that they would have done it but it's not by Almighty neither is it by your power but it's by his Spirit say the Lord of hosts it's not right when I think about that I think about Moses because Moses was a man of great educations but God had to beat that out of him Prophet said very seldom does God call men of great educations to do a great work anytime God's getting ready to do something great he needs somebody who don't know the ABCs who struggle who who can't talk who who don't feel confident in themselves because if you confident in yourself you will think it's you who made it you will think it's you who overcome you will think you will be by your Works lest some man should boast but it's not by your Works lest any man should post but in spite of Grace of almighty God he put a call in your heart this morning oh have patience with your brother have patience with your sister it's a grace of God for all of us oh it's a mercy of God for all of us [Applause] but for the grace of almighty God oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's God that's perfecting you God that's doing the work of perfection God's gonna set things up in your life that when he bless you you are going to know that it's him God is setting things up in your life right now I don't know what situation you're facing or what circumstance you are in but when God is finished with you you will know that it was only god oh friends it wasn't your strength it wasn't your power it wasn't your connections it wasn't your education but it was called that raised you up oh and you didn't have a leg to stand on God put your feet on Solid Ground it was caught and washed you up it was caught that cleaned you out it was God that put a desire in your heart it was caught inside of you all the time and though he slay me yet will I trust him in the valley trust him in the desert trust him when you don't see no light oh but God is my life he is my lamp oh Hallelujah onto my feet he is the light unto my path yet will I trust in him don't put your trust in princes or in Horseman where there is no help David said I look unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help coming from God order the god that made the world he could take care of the world then he could take care of you oh he can take care of you this morning his eyes on the sparrow and I know he is watching over me he's keeping your feet from falling he's putting faith in your soul he's giving you something this morning something to pray something to keep pressing on keep pressing on my brother hold to God's unchanging hand God is faithful and he is just he will reward you according as your work shall be don't you fail this morning [Applause] oh Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Moses knew there was a call of God on his life but he couldn't do anything about it until the time appointed until God was get ready to flip his watch over say time up time up on Egypt time up on slavery time up on bondage time up on your walking around not knowing who you are time up on that this morning time up on you not having faith not having confidence time upon the Devil this morning time upon praise God no praise demons time upon praise God are you making circles Hallelujah making a dead walk time up this morning go call my people out tell them tell Pharaoh let my people go let my people go and I feel God is getting ready to deliver this morning he is faithful to his promise just as he spoke to Abraham my people shall children in a Strange Land but with a mighty hand I'll bring them out into their own land into the land of their fathers our land flowing with milk and honey a land flowing With the blessings with the promises of God a land flowing with the power of God he promised to bring you out come on don't get tired come on don't get over here you've only got one more River One More River to cross one more prayer to prayer one more fight the fights one more Sunday to get the Holy Ghost this is your Sunday this morning give God a shout [Applause] just a little encouragement this morning amen James 1 18 James had a servant of God in The Lord of Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered about greeting my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your fate worketh patience but let patients watch have her perfect work that she may be perfect an entire wanting nothing amen isn't that right oh my hallelujah hallelujah it's not right so Perfection has always been a theme throughout the Bible even Abraham he's spoken to Abraham he said come on walk before me be thou perfect he said that as the tone ever since he called a nation out is that right for his name's sake he's been setting that tone of affection over them and even though he knew they couldn't achieve it at that time God is always thousands of years ahead of us because he knew that he was going to send his son as the one perfect sacrifice for us all to break away for us to enter truly into that Perfection that where Abraham failed you are going to achieve where Joseph might have failed you're gonna achieve where Joshua were different ones praise God mine have gone all the way they without us are not made perfect God having something greater for us oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] foreign they did the best they could for their day but Perfection this is our mantle to to handle our responsibility to perform and we've got to run our leg of the race the race that is set before us we got to run it well we've got to run to endure it's not a short Dash it's not a hundred meters no no no no come on now Amen brother Brown a long distance you gotta soak it in you've got to get it in stride it doesn't happen right away it doesn't happen at the start off but after a while your lungs get into condition your chests get to breathe in Holly you know you got a few miles ahead of you oh but they've caught me with you you're gonna make it oh hallelujah hallelujah don't you worry God is with you keep on moving on keep on striding keep on running with every step you take you're coming closer you're coming closer you might get a little thirsty but that's all right the race is not forever oh no is it for the Swift but it is for them who can endure on to the end I'm gonna endure for my God because he endured for me when the cross was on his back he endured for me now I'm gonna endure for him and your hardness as a good soldier in your struggles in your battles in your present and your persecution enjoy rebuke and your correction enjoy instructions enjoy enjoy I need help this morning to give God praise Hallelujah consistency how do you grow in God read your Bible pray every day consistent makes sense right praise God well and so the prophet said anyway and we believe in him praise God so amen he said let patients have a perfect work right waiting on God Waiting for God to fulfill his promise word you know you can do it I am not God you are not God we didn't make the promise so God made a promise we just conditioning ourselves getting ourselves in the right frame of mind the right conditions the right attitude for him to come and do what he promised he say he going to do it come like the Workman coming and you gotta get your house ready move all the table if you know somebody coming to paint then move the cover draw move the table get the chairs out the room put Gaza paper on the floor if you have to but somebody come into pinch then you make preparation for it where God come in to do our work in your life it's time for you to move all that old stuff out move out everything the prophet said we're right in time but God is fixing to move he wants a move in your life are you ready are you getting ready ready or not he's gonna come when the bridegroom come will you be ready will your clothes Hallelujah will your government be will it be bright will your lamp be trimmed amen will you be ready when the bridegroom come amen got to be ready that's what this message is all about wake the people up get them ready Messiah is on the earth now all right for let no man see so let him ask in fate oh let me go back sorry if any man like wisdom let him ask God that give it to all men liberally or pray that not it shall be given unto him but let him ask in fate not wavering for he that wavered is like a wave of the sea with the wind and tossed isn't that right people tossed about huh still babies can't take that strong meat you gotta have faith can we wavering praise God isn't that right for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways said the Bible all right Hebrew chapter five and six Prophet said that that stumbles then doesn't it oh let's do what he said Prophet said let's go on to perfection not laying against the foundations he said watch this let let's get this word Perfection Prophet saying do you know there's only one way you'll stand in the presence of God he said that's perfect God cannot tolerate Unholy things I'll say that again God cannot tolerate Unholy things that's why you have to come into perfection God's got to bring you into that to where praise God that new body that new praise God he offered you've got to come into Perfection praise isn't that right to bring on a resurrection you're going to a perfect body nobody have no sickness in it you know that body has no filthiness in it you know no desires of the world in it you know our body is a glorified body that body is a beautiful body the one you think you have now that's so wonderful and so nice praise God Amen trust me you and see that body yet because if you see that body but you wouldn't you forget about the Surah you forget about the things thereof oh but God wants you to have faith oh and the thing that you can't see but you believe in his word that he will perform you're going to a glorious boy therefore you yourself have to be perfected have to be tried have to be tested have to be proven have to be stripped have to be taken care of oh honey God have to fit you in there that's what all those trials are about to fit you in there because it can't go in the state you're in you're like a square peg going into a wrong hole God have to shave you down Cut You Down put you on the spinner continue you're crying you're screaming but you need it oh because when you come out you come out right you come out fitted you come out looking good smelling good oh Hallelujah as our bride are going for her husband oh Hallelujah God wants to dress you dress yourself in the Garment of his promised word to go out to meet amen the Lord Jesus Christ it's not right he said a new legalist how could you ever perfect yourself when you have not one thing to perfect yourself said you were born in sin your very conception was in sin the very desire of you being here was sin oh brother this is for me and this is for you this is for everybody but this this put us all at the same level Hallelujah is non-righteous there's none holy there's nothing I could do this for themselves so get that out of your mind this morning it would take Jesus for you to make it it would take Jesus for you to overcome oh I'm here to surrender this morning I'm not here to present myself all fleshes as grass but it is called that perfecteth it it is God but restore it it is God that do it the work and he who started the work he is able to complete it until the end don't you worry oh Hallelujah born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies he said now where are you going to stand at where you sinner that stand said I'll quit smoking and I'll go to heaven where are you lukewarm must back so-called Christian he says that goes around here with a long face saying well I belong to a church he said you sinner that's right he said unless you're born of the spirit of God that you are lost he said that's true oh unless you are born of the spirit of God you are lost he said that's true all the profession Peter had all the big shot Peter had Peter Walk On Water Peter looking brave and strong but when the push come to the shove he couldn't stand the chest he in the corner Cuts in denying that he was ever with them church people denying Hillary's association with Jesus and when he did that he wept bitterly because he knew for himself that he didn't have what it took but on the day of Pentecost Peter received another Spirit a about search coming to Peter and he knew it wasn't him he busts open a door and he said men and Brethren that same Jesus that dude's crucified and hung on a tree that same spirit is here he is the one that you are here and now oh repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the same witness of the holy spirit that we felt any of our room if you do what he said to do he come into you and give you the same power the same anointing this same confidence oh Hallelujah it come by the Holy Ghost not in your mind Perfection is not in your mind this is not in your mind it takes the Holy Spirit to perform that work to turn you into that take the spirit of God to do that take you all the way up from faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness worldly kindness take a spirit to shave you up into that hey go to heaven praise God well I belong to your sinner that's right how are you going to go to heaven you say I never lied in my life oh the darling oh it was just an angel to begin with see he said that's a lie I don't care how good you are you're a sinner and you don't have one thing he said there's no priest there's no Bishop no Pope no nothing else can save you because he is just in the same boats as you are in and you're both drowning he said well we're getting into it a few minutes just in the same shape he said he was he said the pope of Rome was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born by sexual desire of a man and woman he said where are you gonna get righteousness out of that he said well his mama and papa was born the same way Prophet said it was sin to begin with he said so who can say that this is Holy and that is Holy he said there is only one thing holy that's Jesus Christ the son of the Living God oh there is none righteous no one was worried to take the book and to lose the seals thereof and John wept because there was no man worthy to open the seals but someone tapped on the shoulder and said don't weep one of the other said look hello because there is a lamb slain before the foundation in the world you died in Austin he come out hallelujah oh praise God Amen Hallelujah he come out of there took the book praise God and tied for you that's the one who's holy that's the one who's righteous amen not you not a man but him he said who's made perfect sin and our requirement is to be perfect he said that now we're going to be see try it yourself he said well I hate to get to heaven on the on the merits of I was born five minutes ago and going out of the world now I'd be lost if I never thought evil in my life if I never spoke about it in my life I never looked at anything evil never looked at thought of anything evil nothing he said brother I'm just as Rank and black and as smarty as the walls of hell not strong he said but I'm a sinner he said I'm a sinner that's correct I have nothing there's no way at all I could find any price to be paid he said God required death he said and if I give my own life if I give my life then how can I repent he said because because the death has got to be paid first and God was the only one who could lay his life down and take it up again so he could become sin and lay his life down and pick it up and then called it justice and now the debt is paid Prophet said there you are it was Christ that did it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we take a little more this morning it was Christ that paid the debt that's why I'm here to praise God this morning because I know it wasn't me it wasn't my strength it wasn't my ability praise God he took me praised God through a road and he took you through some roads too you know the road Hallelujah he took you from when you press the rewind button in your own mind when you go through them experiences when you almost holler when you almost let go when you almost give

Mercies are over all his Works he'll not forsake the works of his own hands this morning you are the works of his own hands this morning he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he's gonna fill you with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire he's gonna give you your portion give you your inheritance sons of the Holy Ghost baptism believe it it's coming the angel of God with the Call of fire the bird of demons out burn out everything out of you and make a Christian out of you you're gonna stand [Applause] Hallelujah you're gonna be just like Jesus yes I believe in all my heart [Applause] Hallelujah why won't you believe it to amen oh we're here he said now therefore you're kind of perfecting oneself and what you've done right said you're trusting what you've done he said you're lost so be perfect now be there for perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect now therefore he said fifth chapter six chapter Hebrew he said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine let us go on to perfection he said now you brought him Tabernacle I know we have healings that's wonderful we have visions oh that's fine you have spiritual dreams and sometimes sometimes they're not spiritual dreams and sometimes we try to help the poor we do what we can he said oh that's all right but but that's not what we're talking about we said we're entering into another phase leaving the doctrine he said oh yes we got the doctrine of Christ yes we believe he is the Son of God virgin born we believe all that we believe all these things he said that is just wonderful he said but leaving that let's go on to perfection he said oh my listening he said I wish I had the voice of an archangel now to bring this to a place where you could see it oh stop right there you mean the voice of the Archangel will bring it to a place where you can see it yes sir oh what is that the voice of the Archangel seven voices become one voice the voice of God and the last day God promised that that voice will be in the pride oh and you will be known as you are known First Corinthians 13. Hallelujah glory to God that voice is promised to be veiled in our pride Hallelujah You're Gonna Know Hallelujah who your God is know who you are know who God is know who the devil is no Holland no or no praise demons all Fate To Believe that the god that brought you out is the same God has taken you into the Rapture oh he'll change your body he'll make you Hallelujah until what you need you to be to run that race to finish the course praise God to perform your mission even though right your voice without came to yourself amen is not right seven voices thundering out in sweetness and humility failed in you the voice of an archangel the prophet didn't live to see it but there's a pride on here this morning oh she's gonna unfold that second part the voice of the Archangel Hallelujah seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit into the church as Faith put you knowledge Temperance preaching God is broadly kindness and childish charity to seal you up oh and to present a blind a bride blameless before him in love isn't that right it's not right that's right Hallelujah now he says leaving all the doctrine of Christ all the theologians all the theology he said no and we know all about the deity of uh uh of Jesus Christ how he made flesh and all these things Paul goes on to explain it here he said laying again the foundations of repentance from dead Works he said we believe that and Faith towards God we believe that an adoption of baptism see Prophet The Prophet is nailing it down now because he said let us go on to Perfection he's driving a stake so I believe this morning we ought to drive a stake this morning just as a prophet did by inspiration Hallelujah to go on to perfection amen do you believe it today laying on the pants we believe lean our hands don't we amen said see all that sure and the resurrection of the Dead We believe all that he said but now watch see here judgment say he said uh judgment and spoke of Eternal right okay let me skip on down amen so Perfection come true Jesus Christ he died for our perfection and Perfection is not an overnight process can take a little more I don't mean to wear you but a few more things here and then we close up Perfection is not an overnight process it's not a one-and-done thing it's not a crack shot operation it's not a silver bullet trick no it's a it's a process Perfection is a journey Perfection is a long road and Perfection takes time it takes time to get it right takes time to stretch it way out it takes time to test it time to shape it time to mold it time to prove all things time to make sure that it's right if they get in a house ready to be somebody to live in a electrician have to go in there and test the electricals and make sure it work in because it can be flipping switches and things sparking out no no no no that ain't tested properly gotta get somebody to test that to inspect it it's got to pass an inspection then it's ready then it's Fit For A dwell in place then how much more God want to test you to make sure that you're ready for this Holy Ghost promise for this Holy Ghost Revival thing oh brother we gotta get chested God is testing us testing testing testing you're gonna keep getting that test until you pass that test you gotta keep on going on going on hallelujah hallelujah praise God here keep repeating it praise God until you get with the program Ram Hallelujah until you're getting around pray my mind frame attitude I said though he slay me yet I'll trust him yet not my will but thy will be done oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah even Jesus praise God was in the garden against enemy wrestling with himself saying Lord if it's thy with his if it's Lord if if it uh Lord let us pass for me Isn't that right hallelujah praise God if it's if it's possible or if it if it's so be he was struggling wrestling with himself and sometimes God have to get you in a place where you have to wrestle with God wrestle with his word just like Jacob came down to the river and he wrestled oh he had one more River to Cross and he laid there and he wrestled with a man all night long he fought he grappled he graveled he balled he pegged he screamed he stayed there all night long some of you give up too easy you need to keep on going you ain't there yet you ain't perfected yet so get on your knees brother get to the altar get to the Hallelujah lay prostrate before God and get next to yourself and wrestle with that self and say self you got to die die to your fields that your unbelief die to your fornication everything praise God until something inside of you is birth a new then you come out a new creature and you come out a new person you are not okay until you receive the Holy Ghost you're not okay until you're born again you're not all right until God has filled you with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire with fire fire fire fire fire the burn of the Demons fire the burn of the Lost fire the burn of the lies fire the burn of the filthiness father burnouts the thoughts in your mind and make you a true servant of God it takes fire to do that in your heart and in your life and you know it this morning why don't you come to the altar oh Hallelujah Oh Glory [Applause] Ecclesiastes a time to plant time to reap a time to test the Sheep to mold everything a time under the sun there's no five easy steps people try to bypass the process because it's a long and hard process but that's God's provided way that's the way God trains his man in Jeremiah 12 5 says if thou has run with the footmen and they have varied thee then how can thou contend with horses and if in the land of Peace wherein thou trust it they weary thee then how will you do at the swelling of the Jordan oh Hallelujah you got to be able to run the race brother oh you can't paint oh they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall walk and not paint they shall run and not be weary oh some of you get weary sometimes but you need to trust in the Lord the prophet said you need to lay in the presence of the sun until the right and until the greenness get baked out of you until all your fleshiness until all your purposeness gets burned out of you you need to lay in a hot July Sun until God burn out all of the desire in your hearts everything that you can overcome lay in the presence of the sun until your intellect get dried up until you have no more mind until it's yet not I but Christ are living in me here some of you not baked out yet God's Gonna Bake you out some of you not burnt out yet God's Gonna burn you out until you burn your knees until you recognize that you are not gonna make it until God save your soul until you cross that River [Applause] who am I and God called man the prophet said before we can have a Revival God's got to call out and train men caught train man to carry this message they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go to the fiery furnace in defeat or to the Lions then or wherever it may be they're ready to go because they've been in the presence of God and they know that he is whether it's a victory or to defeat they still stand the same oh my God I want that kind of resolution in my heart that when the evening Shadows Fall now when the devil cover the Earth cover the principalities of powers and everything there's something inside your soul that is still standing the devil may get them but he cannot get all he hasn't got you this morning or rise and shine thy light has come oh can I get amen oh just a few more we finish don't faint on me now oh Hallelujah come on now where are you long distance Runners where are you fate Runners oh Hallelujah keep on pressing on keep on pressing on you're gonna make it you're gonna overcome he love you he making a way for you this morning [Music] that's the kind of training God does a man it's very strange saying God to do that that God trains this man like that but he does and you know we have an old song he should be saying he said something to the waters some sort of flood some true deep trials but off with the blood God leads his people through great trials to purge them oh say hey man somebody to purge you why so that you could bring forth much food to put you why said you could bring forth more food oh and here it is my father glorified that you bring forth much fruit it isn't that right he said sometimes it take years to do it that's for myself tonight I believe that right now God is training such men Prophet said to meet the front line men who are going through amen and time shook from their feet sometimes look like the whole thing is falling but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God and they keep their face forward moving on it's not right Perfection is a journey it's not right it's a journey a journey of redemption Redemption is in two parts isn't that right coming out of going into and it's good for us to come out we praise the Lord they shouted when they came out of Egypt oh it was a time of rejoicing nothing wrong with that but that's not the whole story after you come out you still have something to go into Amen brother Brown Hallelujah God wants us to go into something God took Israel out of Egypt through the long way through the heart away why so that he could get Egypt out of Israel isn't that right he said the prophet said you joined the Nazarene Church will never make you perfect you join in the Baptist Church will never or whatever Pentecostal Church whatever it is it'll never make you perfect you being a good loyal man will never make you perfect you can't Merit one thing there's nothing about you to Merit Prophet said you are lost you say well I keep the law I keep the Sabbath I keep this and and I keep that on all these things Paul said lay aside all those things now he said that's right but we do this we baptize the people we lay hands on them he said we can take it verse by verse he said but there's one hope one Lord One Faith one baptism we believe that baptism we believe in our accidental dead and so forth these signs shall fall on the sick follow follow them that lay hands and sick and everything he said that's something we do he said but let's go on to perfection Oh my he said we are coming watch into the Tabernacle not the foundation not the floor part but the Tabernacle itself he said we're coming into that he said that's the foundation the law and righteousness and joining church and being baptized and laying on hands and that's all orders of the church he said but now let's go on into Perfection he said there's only one that is perfected and that is Jesus amen do you see a church amen Glory hallelujah amen so how do we get into him true Methodist no true Pentecostal no Baptist Prophet said no to any church nope to any group huh by being in a message by going into by standing in a church break back by doing this do not no sir how do we get a Perfection that's what we want to know crisis perfected he said how do you get into a preacher by joining this Tabernacle he said know your loss how do we get into it he said First Corinthians 12 by one spirit we are all baptized into one body amen what paragraph 18 by the Holy Spirit baptism we're baptized into that body and are free from sin and God don't see you no more he only sees Christ ah reflecting back that's a Perfection all of your reflection is the Perfection when Christ is reflecting through you through your life he beat the drugs out of you praise all he sees in America is a mirror and he sees himself in it oh the mirror of the word isn't that right oh my and when you're in our body God can't judge that body because it's already judged he took all judgments and invited us in and by faith through Grace we can walk and accept our pardoning and the Holy Spirit brings us into fellowship with him and we walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit Quicken the word came into US oh the prophet said he died in my Stead I'm Made Alive here I am who was once dead in sin and trespasses been made alive Almighty is highest is to serve him is that your desire this morning he said in all my love is to him all my walks want to be in his name that wherever I go whatever I do I glorify him Prophet said if I'm hunting if I'm fishing if I'm playing ball whatever I'm doing I must be Christ in me I'm such in such a life that will make man long to be that way not tattling backbiting and fussing about churches and so forth you get it the congregation says amen he said by one Spirit we are baptized into that body he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's not right Romans 12 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that he present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good unacceptable and perfect will of God oh Hallelujah isn't that right glory amen this is a prophet saying it might be closer than you think it's got me scared oh I I haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more Prophet said he announces that time is over what happens what happens he says could that be so now Brethren seriously think he said if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven Thunders he said he remembered a permanent message it's a Capstone he said what did it do the Holy Spirit caps off the individual Visual and then seals it when we add to our faith righteousness Godly uh godliness and Holiness and faith and so forth and kept adding until we got seven things and then the seven one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual amen and caps him and seals him with the holy spirit that is what I want this morning pray that's what I come for to be capped off to be a finished work sealed in and the devil is sealed out of your life close the door on the devil forever oh Hallelujah Glory that that's a condition he's going to bring you into and whatever you're struggling with one day that struggle will be over because the devil will be sealed out and you're gonna be sealed in with Christ you and Jesus walking on that third phase on that third step oh on that third pole Walking with God hallelujah praise God oh my Lord then if that be so he's got seven Church ages he's got seven Mysteries that's been sounded away throughout every Church age right and they fought for to bring it back oh they didn't get it casually they didn't get it by sleeping in church they fought to bring it back oh to Bloodshed to sweat to tears through persecution to trial say fought they had prayer meetings oh you got to fight this morning you've got to dress your shoulders back you've got sun in a fight for the devil might get all but even I can't get you oh Hallelujah you are the Escape ones this morning Hallelujah devil might get the church but he can't get you the individual you're going in a Rapture the true church she goes in her going away amen oh man that's right he fought to bring him back another headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunder's mean that my brother he said Is this where we're at he's saying this in desperation oh my Ephesians 4 Prophet said um sorry the Bible says and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers right put a perfecting of the sins that's what it's for amen it's for your Perfection not for them to remain Prophet apostles forever and ever and ever but it's for your Perfection that's the purpose of it oh not for them to blow their own horn or the blood and trumpet no no no it's to serve the people they bring the people into our condition to present them blame us isn't that right before God In Love Hallelujah till we all come into the unity of the fish oh and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure the stature the fullness of Christ why that we get a henceforth be no more children toss to and fro carried about at every wind of Doctrine and so forth but speaking the truth and love growing up in all things which is ahead even Christ Prophet said God is Rich and mercy I'm getting ready to wind down he said and Redemption has two different parts coming out of going in two right and first you have to come out some people want to bring the world in with them but you gotta come out of the world to enter into Christ you have to come out of unbelief come out of what you think come out of what you're doing do you know to do better however you come out of iniquity oh because iniquity is abound the love of many will wax call oh people not sell us anymore people not fervent anymore people not desire us anymore because they get caught up in iniquity they know what to do rights but they're doing wrong get next to yourself search out your own salvation with fear and trembling and get right with God or God will judge that thing get that Spirit off of you make yourself a Christian after that you have received the Holy Ghost make yourself a Christian make yourself into this let Christ be ahead oh Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come out of unbelief enter into fate it cannot be one thing in your way you really have to have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word be the word of God behind to enter into faith he said and that was the book of Ephesians the Old Testament Joshua where Moses represented the law but I could not save no one but Grace could and here Joshua is the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior I know when we find out that we have to come to another Ephesians here's your promise here Brian here's your promise here friends

dead being raised the blind seal the walking you overcome in your Philistines you driving out the enemy all of that is in another Ephesians this morning and we are called to Perfection to go into another Ephesians another Ephesus now oh whether there are intellectual denominations and so forth and of all our educational programs all of that the prophet said has come to its Jordan and then we must have an Ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the Rapture we've got to cross that River friends hey do you believe it we've got across Jordan One More River the prophet said God requires our Jordan in every life is that right God called man he said there's coming an hour paragraph 97 when God shall make the world bow at the man feet of men and women who has plunged through and crossed Jordan and separated themselves musicians could get ready I'm gonna write a line down from the things of the world brother sister tonight whatever you do whatever you think
