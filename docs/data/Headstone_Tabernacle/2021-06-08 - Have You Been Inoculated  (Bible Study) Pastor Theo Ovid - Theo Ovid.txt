tonight as we look to you in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you and welcome and so glad to have you here tonight and um it seems my luck to speak to you tonight and to share some of you tonight and i'm grateful i consider it as an honor and privilege to just share the word and to speak to you you know um today and we and i got our first dose of the cyanopharm vaccine today we got vaccinated and um the title that i have tonight of what i want to share with you is have you been inoculated it's the title that i have tonight so just listen you know up front and um you know i wanted to answer the question of whether or not we should take the inoculation and um i'll take the vaccine with a testimony of having actually received it and they want to talk about it before actually having received it myself so um we did so today amir and i and um up to yesterday i heard about people in this message talking about this being the mark of the beast and i really find that to be fearful foolish what i call conspiracy theory revolution now i i'm not one who goes with all what on facebook and all the people seeing and all the sharing and forwards and stuff as to is this is that and the other i really um not one uh to go dear what i can see is that i believe israel now is about over 60 percent fully vaccinated in israel the thing about it is the pandemic it's not an epidemic it's not a local thing it's something that is international it's around the world israel who is surrounded by enemies know that they can't risk their country just falling apart or just crashing like that as such they i think one of the top ones who you know have really been successful in the attempts to curb this virus this pandemic and i believe and i've been people have been asking should i take it and whatnot i can't say that i i'm not going to tell you do not take it i'm not going to peddle that um you know what and um somebody say you know as a man say it's going to change your dna and all kind of thing these these people they're not scientists they're not doctors but they have a lot of opinions and stuff and things like that but i believe that you are more at risk being unvaccinated than being vaccinated and i want to say tonight the devil trades in debt that's his currency anything connected to the enemy is dead if he could cut your life short he would if he gets an opportunity to remove you off the face of this hood he would because your life and testimony as a christian is a threat to his kingdom you have the ability to win others you have the ability to snatch souls out of unrighteousness and darkness into this glorious light and you know i was telling my wife so i'm so funny so if taking the vaccine is taking the mark of the beast well if you die you can't by yourself it's very interesting you know if you take it and you die you really care by yourself but the bible says the devil received all except those names are not written and you have to believe tonight that your name is on that book your name is written and god gonna keep you safe and some are you hearing me know sorry about that but that was that was um a small clip concerning the origination of this so-called vaccination and when smallpox um attacked europe and so on many people were dying and everything else and they discovered the maids who were milking cows they did not it was not affecting them and then scientists discovered that cold pox they had called pox small blues in their skin and so on but the the the other box wasn't affecting them smallpox wasn't affecting them so what they did they take some of the callpox from these maids hands and so on like that and they create this thing and they injected it into somebody who was healthy and they produced antibodies and so on and that would vaccine come from vacca which is called and so on this whole the brute of this thing called vaccine and um and it's very interesting i was thinking about what did jesus do how did jesus do things and so on and and uh then this scripture this particular scripture maybe i could find it i could read it in john chapter nine so we can find it for you and jesus passed by and he saw a man which was blind from his birth and the disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born dying jesus answered saying neither had this man sinned nor his parents but at the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night comment no man can work as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world and when he had dust spoken he spat on the ground made clay out of spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent and he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing the neighbors therefore and they which before had seen him that was blind your blind said it's not he that sat and begged and some said this is he other said he is like him but he said i am he therefore it is said unto him how would thine eyes open and he answered and said a man that is called jesus made take me clean and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight and then said they unto him where is he he said i know not they brought him to the pharisees him that before time was blind it was a sabbath day and when jesus made the claim and opened his eyes then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto him he put clay upon my eyes and i wash and i do see therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keep it not the sabbath day but has said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them they say unto the blind man again what sees though of him that he opened up thine eyes he said he's a prophet but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called his parents of him that had received his sight and they asked them saying is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he see his parents answered them and said we know not this is our son that he is was born black but by what means he's now see it we know not or who had opened his eyes we know not he's of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words speak his parents because they fear the jews for the jews that agreed already agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he would be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he's of age ask him then again called they again called the man that was blind and said unto him give god praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he's a sinner or not i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind no i see then said they unto him again what did he do today how old me than eyes he answered and said i have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will you also be disciples and they reviled him and said thou art his disciples but we are moses disciples we know that god speak unto moses for as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why hearing his marvelous thing that he knew not from whence he is and yet he had opened mind eyes and now we know that god hear it not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of god and do it his will him he hear it and since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind and if this man were not of god he could do nothing they answered and said unto him there was altogether born in sins look at the attitude here he says that this man if this man was not of god he could do nothing he answered and said unto him though was altogether born in sin and don't teach us and they cast him out and jesus heard that they cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the son of god he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him and jesus said unto him though has been seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and you worship him and jesus said for judgment i am come unto this world that they might that they would see might not see and they which see might be made blind and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also and jesus said unto them if you were blind you would have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sin remain what does scripture may god bless his word tonight and jesus boss them good and proper he say if only all you're blind you know sin but if all you say you see i'll catch you right there because you see it for yourself now i read that scripture to show you that jesus didn't just by spirit be healed we see no he spit on the ground he mixed clay plies in the man eyes and tell him go and wash he take what was dear and made something out of it and the man had to just go and apply it wash at the sea uh they pull up a salon and then he was made whole and god and god and god bless them amen praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord so trust tonight by god's grace that you uh edified that are edified by this tonight so let me say it again that i believe you are greater at risk being unvaccinated than being vaccinated and satan trades in debt that is what he treats him because that is his cut-off point that is as far as he could go he can't really go beyond debt and this is where the inoculation of the gospel comes in and the inoculation of the power of the gospel comes in that we can know that he could raise us from the dead and the grave have no victory over the blood watchman so we thank god throughout the night so how many of you were blessed by sunday service uh obedience is better than sacrifice and um i was i was sharing with a brother today about you know when god tell you to do something that's what god wanted you could go on fast and pray for 10 days 20 days whatever but until they come back to obey what god said if that god said make these things right and you know you have to make that right and the issue here was that the instruction given to saul to saul was to kill everything and yet he claimed that this here kept his side was to offer unto the lord and samuel tell him since when is sacrifice more important than obedience obedience is better than sacrifice disobedience is a sin of witchcraft we have to conform and conform to his will and tonight i have a testimony i like to read share with you by god's grace um i know i didn't ask brother but i want to say to some uh brother kelly's out and he shared something he said dear brother ovid i was very humbled by yesterday's invitation to know the mind of god although we heard the message of obedience is better than sacrifice when it was first preached zeida and i both agreed that we didn't really hear it at all last time i just say that we have really been blessed and strengthened and comforted by the lord as we listen this time in fact every service that has been replayed has been greatly devoured by us spiritually speaking truthfully i wasn't able to hear much of anything in times past but this year has been really different and i am thanking god daily by having passed some debt under life i wanted you to know that i took the experience i wrote to you one word to really see what it was and to my joy found it all over the message all over the bible it's not a day that passes that i don't consider that wonderful but wonder that the lord has actually made me a real christian only someone who has been born as i can understand the contrast i marvel at it every day and the joy of it is i keep growing zeida and i pray daily for you and your wife and family and the church they're in trinidad although we are at a great distance from each other our hearts are bound up with you all and we look forward to every time we can be together with you in the zoom chat rooms may god greatest care and blessing be with you and your family and the church our brother kelly salt so we are so grateful we are thankful for get us all testimony and greetings from brother kelly he's the states and we certainly appreciate that tonight and it's so unique because i was sharing some brethren uh last night about broadly love and the spirit of forgiveness and how much we should enter in you know and and how is the key because right after broadly love is holy spirit so and the only way we could manifest or get this brotherly love activated is if there are issues around us whether it's family friends church people whatever there's going to be stuff that people do to you it's not fear it's not right and is uh they are not being tested you are it's how you manage the issues around your life and that demonstrates a lot of your maturity see so like brotherly kindness and i call it the spirit of forgiveness not talk not not not saying back rather because that talk but but really something that that lives out and so on so blow my testimony came this evening here i got a phone call and brother was sharing with me about after sunday service obedience is better than sacrifice that you know come to his heart about something he did 25 years ago it is both how he really you know treated him badly and and and not only that a year ago when he was overseas he shared with another gentleman that if he could only get in contact with that man he would tell him he's sorry how he acted and different things like that but he didn't know where he was at something that happened 25 years ago but it kind of arrived in him so he was wondering and you know what he did now i got his testimony just about an hour or so ago and he did make some calls get to find out where this man is at finally get to speak to him and the man was so happy to hear his voice and the man say well he himself has been badly beheaded badly even you know things was real good and so on and making it up and so like that and this brother testified that after doing that he felt light and that is something really powerful he said that message obedience is better than sacrifice spoke to him it really did something for him and i find it was really powerful and he said since that time um that was like yesterday that happened that he called the guy and make his right and today he got emails with job offers and you know and it's amazing how things connect with things you know and i and i keep seeing that you may feel powerful because of decisions you make or decisions you want to make all decisions you are going to make but you are not in charge of the outcome of those decisions make the decisions wisely regardless of what family or friends try by god's grace to pray and get a feel of should i really do this should i you know do this because here it is i am not convicting this brother's heart to make this right of something that of an attitude that he had 25 years ago and he told me he said well over this i know that i am doing the right thing i know i'm doing the right thing and it's a comfort in your spirit in your heart and mind to know that you are doing the right thing and you know uh we have to get to that spot if you know people will hate you love them still if you know people you give them and they wouldn't give you back give them still if they would reward you or honor you honor them still do the right thing the prophet said this way is you think right you speak right you do right you would come out right and i believe god will honor his word and god told them when miriam came out of the red sea and they came out and married him dance and the bangla river you go see if you listen to me and obey me all the plagues that hit egypt and whatnot will not hit you it will not come nigh and what god will be asking for is obedience the thing of it is jesus himself learned obedience so venus is not an automatic thing it's not a pill you take and swallow it um obedience is not for laity only no obedience is for all it have men of god who disobeys just like saul a king of all kind of people who jonah he he didn't see the need to go down to another because the never different people culture everything else he head down to nineveh he had gone to a tashish rather and got her to straighten him out and get him right back on track and if the night you're in this room and you're not on track god's desire for you is to come on track god desire for you is not to embarrass you and shame you and make you look like a laugh and stop that's not god's objective god objective is to redeem to restore and bring back so trust the night that this would help you what we share here tonight and it will edify you don't know how long i'll be but i trust him that um we'll be blessed tonight amen so if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to acts chapter 19 1-6 and we want to read from jeremiah 8 14-22 again welcome acts chapter 19 reading from verse 1. it came to pass that while apollos was as current spall having passed through the upper coast of came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said to them have you received the holy questions you believe in other words have you been inoculated and they said unto him we have not so much has heard whether there be any holy ghost answer them unto what then will you baptize they said unto john's baptism and then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance seen unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is in christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them they didn't become the holy ghost the holy ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied jeremiah chapter 8 reading from verse 40. jeremiah chapter 8 verse 14. why do we sit still assemble yourselves let us enter into the defense cities let us be silent there for the lord our god had put us in silence and give us water of gold to drink because we have sinned against the lord we look for peace and no good come and for a time of health and behold trouble the snorting of his horses were heard from them the whole land tremble are the song of the name of the strong ones for the outcome and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those are dwell therein for behold i will send serpents choices among you and they will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is fainting me behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion it's not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their grieving images and their strange vanities the harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not safe for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hood i am black astonishment have taking hold of me is there an obama in gilead is there no physician dear why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered let us pray father god we pray one more time on your scriptures on your word that you'd bless it interpret your heart and jesus might ask it amen the amplified of that last verse verse 22 says is there an obama gilead is there no physician dear why then is not the health of the daughter of my people restored because zion no longer enjoyed the presence of the great physician and that's the question why why and brother branham was speaking and talking about uh if a man went to the doorstep of a doctor the disease right at the daughter doorstep of the doctor can you blame the doctor if he doesn't want to take the medication you you can blame the toxin who to blame can't blame the doctor he's got the toxin he's willing to give it can't blame the toxin science has found it a disease so he dies right on the doorstep but don't blame the doctor people are dying right in the pews from sin it is not because we haven't got toxin isn't it isn't because we haven't got physicians is because the people don't want to take it and if we could fix your arm up it's a dangerous thing not to do that you should do it it's dangerous if you don't do it there was a time we didn't have much toxin people died with bacteria they got a toxin fentanyl or like a vaccine fit you say polio is salt toxin i sure appreciate that i believe a man if man can be more humble but abraham you believe in divine healing you say all of that is divine healing because only god could heal i am the lord thy god who healed all thy diseases he said no missing so far it is dangerous to take generally because you see you hear stories about like somebody took the vaccine and died listen the vaccine always affect somebody negatively there are people who cannot have they just don't have this health system or whatever whatever it is so he says it's dangerous to take but you might get by with not taking the doctor's toxin but you can't get by without taking gorge toxin is bomb you can't do it he says now how do they find a toxin how do they find a vaccine well science reads up on a whole lot of stuff and they boil it together and they put test tubes and so forth and after a while they get down to where they think they got it they shoot it into a guinea pig and if he survives it then they shoot it in you right you know mesut will kill some people and help some others penicillin has killed many and it has helped about you know when i went to the doctor today they asked me if i lose you to anything i tell them the red and white penicillin um tablet i am illusions did that because one time years ago i was sick and i went hospital they gave me these tablets and i was getting worse first and i recognized they were trying to kill me and since then they say that i'm not supposed to see that tablet so every time i go to hospital i have a kind of not fear i say you know what cosmetics is not a nice person i feel like the devil just waiting to finish you off he want to kill you and he will kill you if you can because that is his currency he trades in debt so you see so this is uh the prophet i want to just continue here now he said penicillin has killed as many as it helped that's right i was reading about it the other day we had nurse take pencilling for the last 15 years or more she took her dose and killed her instantly see it'll kill some help some because all people are not made like guinea pigs see that's the reason it helps some and kills the other but god's toxin helps all it cures it's not a remedy it's a cure see the number one killer is his heart he said i want to differ with you the numbers number one killer is sin trouble that's the number one killer you say i can't quit smoking i can't quit i have been untrue to my wife brother branham i just can't quit it one woman is not enough for me the other one one woman said oh i don't know brother branham i just started as a young guilty run around i just can't quit breaking up my home you know what it's just because you didn't try the toxin you just refused to take it we have got stuff that kills that we have got the stuff that makes you live decent to your wife and email we have got the things that take the desire of cigarettes out of you we have got this stuff that takes the sin out of you but if you refuse to take it you just won't try the toxin you're afraid of your social standing you're afraid of the new book and we know the new book is a mess people don't want to get messy and we have something here a man that is born again when you're born again is when the control of his life it is center its direction is passing himself to god and that's a sign of somebody born again when they no longer on the i think i and i and me and i and me and i when the center of your control is passed over to god so you are interested in what is god's mind what is god's will what is god's plan what is god's purpose god becomes first before husband before wife before children before family god comes first he becomes the control he's at the center there he's directing your life and you will see fruits of it you would see fruits i knew it personally as a not just as a minister or a pastor as a christian as a believer i see the hand of god guide my steps and guide me in my marriage my relationship my children you know different steps to the way you see what if i had made a different decision what if i made a different choice i love choices i love decisions because decisions give you know the opportunity for you to to choose based upon what is clicking in your system and that brother today he had a choice he could have just dismissed that uh about 25 years ago why i believe that but you see god want to free him lightness spirit and if that is something that is cloudy over him uh that's the only way it could be lifted out now not only that he no other opportunity to testify to that man about the love the power and the kingdom of god because the man will wonder oh and it all these years you calling me to tell me that it's just as a kind of mind-blowing thing like that i remember when i came to the lord i was going backward instead of forward i believe mission viola i'm reading my spoken word books and um you know my mother telling me and i'm not even listening because i i only word it you know what i mean and like going downstairs like young person and something like that and one day my sister told me she said you are so hard and then it struck me because the spirit of speaking in my heart whatever they say right to do do it and i say sister i am sorry she jumped she said you sorry is that you she didn't expect these words out to me so what was happening is that because of my knowledge i became arrogant because of what i knew we were all catholics and i know something better than them i know what rome and revelation 17 and different things like that you see so instead of going forward with humility and everything else i was going backwards not knowing it with head with intellect you see so like moses who parents taught him and shared stuff with him he was peddling but intellect and his intellect really allow him to kill one man and run that what intellect does it could only last so much it could only give you so much strength but when he met that pillar fire his whole life was changed and transformed that is why the program says five minutes in the presence of that pillar of fire it was more than all the 40 years of knowledge information and so on that he had in egypt so i know you could be changed in five minutes time whether right now while the word is speaking you get that presence of god affecting your life or even after when you bow and pray and so on like that it could change you we don't hear much about this in the message you hear about what people know and what revelation they have and they're trying to show that they know something more than somebody else and you know the devil just laugh at that because that ain't cast not no devil you know that ain't moving no enemy and so on what we need to see is active sun sun's being activated that they be empowered in the in the kingdom of god for the kingdom sea so it goes beyond your household it goes beyond your family you are son of the kingdom the realm that god wants to bring us into is this realm of the kingdom jesus said to this way my kingdom is not of this world so all the disciples was being breathed into another world that jesus was living in normal they knew not about that world but he had to testify of the power of that world and you know the other time a woman was going to see brother branham and she wanted to be healed and he told her he said go on stand by the street and across the street in lights and you'll meet a man and he will turn you to a doctor who would perform the operation and you'll be healed no you can't figure out these things you cannot do like how neyman said the man of god supposed to come outside and lay hands and do that i know he likes them go and wash seven times in jordan river we cannot tell god how to fulfill his word and how to bring the past healing restoration redemption deliverance in our lives every one of you as an individual have a name you don't have the same name in this room everybody have an individual name individual fingerprint and every one of you will have your individual trials individual questions every individual challenges some people are more loved than others more forgiveness than others more decent others and whatnot so god knows what is out of there but more than what god knows is what the enemy have access to so you see because we are falten because he's a prince of the power of the ear because he reading and ruling here for the last how much thousands of years the enemy he have access to inflict with sicknesses disease and all kinds of things like that that's his right and the final access he has is really hook stick the grim reaper which is dead and if he could get you fearful you panic but paul said that where's your sting graveyard is your victory then guys talk differently now people who going on before go on and ahead and trying to get brethren what's going on thank god for them they're in a better place and better world they they leave us here not just to see troubles you know i see like some people firing off and going and they leave it as bad boy you know but they're leaving us back not just to see troubles as such but they are leaving us back that we could come to perfection or let's see it come to full maturity because we need to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection day with us and not be perfect be without us are not made perfect so brethren we have something to strive unto we we're not striving to be a better church no we are striving to fulfill the promised world like jesus said it his spirit is upon me for what but he anointed me to do what to fulfill the word of that day we cannot stop what the government's going to do they have to do it they have no choice because satan controlling governments controlling the world system controlling styles and fashion controlling entertainment so he's controlling the entire system so the whole world system is influenced by lucifer whether they have tied jacket whether they look nice talk peaceful is controlled by that all the false prophets and have a ton of them just that jesus prophesied is controlled by the devil the churches controlled by the devil the bible talked about they have blasphemous names so at the end time is not church it's a people by his name's sake he's calling out the gentiles that is where you are being called out a people for his namesake not church but a people a bride bible talk about his wife had made herself ready not somebody come and dress your heart made herself ready so that means just like the wise virgin get extra oil they are going to be a people that not satisfied just have a container but they have to have extra because when the foolish virgins wake up and recognize listen time to leave like a lump and move they recognize the oil ran out they had something you know all of them have something but will it last will it face the test will it will it deal with the challenges that is before us because when god gave the prophet the test he said you have been given power i'll share with you some bridges you'll be given power to buy any member but be more sincere he's a prophet you have a heart for the people you have for the god and the thing of it is that snake that mamba which is the most vicious dangerous african snake the black mama that member couldn't touch the prophet but you know what was killing going after brethren now if if the prophet was that is touching me or all your on your own you know what happened the black mamba taken off people one by one by one but the power was given to him not if you be sincere get it note what was said not if you are sincere you will get the power but you have been given power but here what i want you to do clean up re-examine search your heart i want it to come deeper this is not a head thing i want to get a burden for others i want you to see that if it can't affect you it gonna affect others and you have the power to bind the danger that could affect others ministers could be very dangerous because their words given to people and to the congregation is very important it's very important and people hold on to some words that they say so it's it's it's it's important what we present and what we see that we don't inject our own bias on our own feelings and thoughts about the matter so i can say to you the vaccine is satan is lucifer and you know the the the um the polio vaccine is proven and it's back to improvement is man that when that god inspired man to reduction this is your point is that man just do no is god inspire man to discover this medication and that medication so sure it might be negative on one or two people out of a million or whatever it is but the reality is god is the one who's a healer and he used different ways of healing you could take herbs you could do this you could pray you could get divine healing miracles whatever but god is the one in charge of that so i cannot tell people you know what this is this and this won't ever take this this will happen why don't people say rejecting the holy ghost has taken immaculate peace and did it right there rejecting this holy ghost we talk about in acts 19 is taking the mark of the beast because all that dwell on the earth whose name is not written they don't have the mark of god it's just two marks it's not 20 marks and pick a choice it's either the mark of the beast or the mark of god and you get god's seal not to make your son but because you are son god could put his seal upon you that is why you are who you are i remember the early days i said myself lord why did you call me why did you you know because you feel here you're falling and you want to know well what is this thing that you can't you have to get back to the world you have to get back to god you have to get back and pray god put the seed inside of you and that seed of a toast so regardless of what your flesh act up or your spirit accurate that seed and you have a tooth tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord do you love him tonight oh praise the lord give him some praise give him some worship so therefore when you are born again the control of your life is not you it's not you are the source and you're thinking and this isn't me and this is me oh yeah that is you you need to be born again afterwards the center changes where it's of god now prophet said you're afraid of the new birth it only makes you a different person if you're not a different person then you're not converted you might be converted into denomination you might be converted into a different atmosphere or something but when you are converted to god then you live holy when you are converted to god then you live holy i believe in holiness i can prove you by the bible and i don't care what you do you cannot offer god a gift with unholy hands he won't receive it the gifts in the old testament had to be sanctified at the altar the priests before he could go in to offer it had to be anointed and sanctified or the gift was refused god will not accept the gift by an holy hand that's right it must come true holy hands or you won't accept it and that's why the bible says if you go to pray and you know you have something against your brother leave a gift at the altar go and make it right with your brother and then come back and pray because this faith we're going back to this ephesians fate is based on forgiveness it doesn't beat a sitting down intellectual say you believe something it is based on real forgiveness and that forgiveness has to be manifested in us we know the story about brother brown he went into this restaurant he saw this woman carrying out with some men and different things it upset him rightly so then he put himself in a corner and said lord is this the place where my daughter want to raise up why don't you condemn this place and wipe this place out god tapping on my shoulder pull him aside sway when he was small swim tea committing sins and stuff and his sins going up to god showing a blood bump around the earth keep boxing it off not reaching god boxing it off show him he's right on a book called pardon showing his sins trapped in the sea of forgetfulness all that is by vision and that god tells him i forgive you and you condemn her now this is a real experience this is not talk and talk and talk this is showing the kind of heart god has the kind of compassion and this is what i'm saying if we're talking about jesus christ you see him yesterday today and forever we have to see the same kind of compassion the same kind of love the same kind of care the same kind of concern we have to see that to talk about message this is where jesus ministry when was called in the adultery of the act of adultery we see it in jesus ministry with the woman at the well we see it in jesus ministry where the woman was crying at his feet and wiping his feet and drying his seat with her ear we see it all over to the bible and if we see that is god or word made flesh and you see his behavior where is all this legalistic condemning writing of people who is shocked who are making it who going to hell and where's all of that and human beings human beings putting people in and putting people out the kingdom where is all of that coming from think about it hell has enlarged its mouth the devil trying to pull down into hell every soul he can and heaven has opened up to try to pull up everybody that is here we're in a war that war is on tonight it's a war for your soul and sometimes i wonder and i see sometimes god snatched people off the earth and i was talking to my wife and telling you know is it worth it the lust for power the lust for popularity the lust for fame and after people become famous and popular and they're well known and everybody know them and so on both in the secular and religious realm you see the world come crashing down flesh and blood is it really worth it you want power you want this and when you get it afterwards that time just done just just flit away i don't wonder why the bible said what shall the prophet under he gain the whole world and lose his soul oh my trust the night that you're being helped is there a bomb in gilead is there no physician dear you know jesus prophet said he was baptized in jordan dove came this is by beloved son and he inoculated he got an inoculation himself he got god's toxin which was the holy ghost itself and the fullness when he was tempted he talks and held a vaccine hell you could say when he smite his face he was riled up on he didn't speak back when he put a rat upon his head if you're a prophet tell us who hit you he talks in hell and they pull his beard out of his face he spits on his face and so on and he went to calvary to talk to him in the hour of death he talks in hell but on easter morning it proved it was god toxin gives eternal life and this is a just a little backdrop here he says you know when the doctors want to try the toxin they scored it in the guinea pig see how he acts you know when god brought his toxin down he didn't put a guinea pig he put it in his son himself he made himself a body he overshadowed a virgin mary he created a body and he separated himself isn't that right and he put that didn't get that guinea pig his own son his own life was on the punishment and he said you know there was a time there was wasn't any toxins for smallpox many die with smallpox bacteria when an epidemic breaks out in the city quickly you go down and get a smallpox vaccination or deteriorate shot they got toxic i'm thankful for that i'm glad of that i'm glad we got it the salt vaccine for little children i thank the lord for that and pray he will give us more and more i believe if we just warm up to god there are things here for us we was made out of the earth you know if we warm up to him and pray to him and quit our wickedness and things all these things will be found that's right for you who believe he's got a remedy beyond that he said god bomb wasn't perfect because in the beginning because it was drawn from the veins of animals that only covered sin it didn't divorce it there was no excuse now but one day god made a toxin he said and he gave it to his son and he inoculated him at the jordan and when the holy ghost come down upon him every eye watch him as he lives he lived the life of god he looked like god he acted like god he he lived like god he prayed like god he healed like god he raised a dead like god he was god he was inoculated from the things of the world and they watched them and they all of his death the inoculation held and they knew he was a prophet a roman soldier put raga on his head and they closed his eyes and he took a stick and he hit him on the head and said no if you be a prophet tell us who hit you and we believe you the inoculation held he said and when they took a handful off of his beard and they spit on him he said and his own children cried for his blood the inoculation held he said father forgiveness they know not what they do when he was riled upon he ran back the inoculation held all hell was looking to see if that could hold he was making a way for you and i making an example and when he died at the cross the inauguration held at least a morning it proved it so dead couldn't hold it life and death can't exist in the same place he rose on the third day the obnoxious inoculation health you're sending on high and people began to long they wanted the inoculation finally there had been a serum there had been a serum given by god that would raise up the dead from the grave they wanted that inoculation and the first one i heard of it i wanted it to i am so glad we still have plenty of it inoculation from sin oh my there was a hundred and twenty become patience right away for this scene it's hold in temptation my god and what happened it went in the upper room they seen it in the hour of temptation it held in the hour of debt and when he was in the grave three days and three nights the inauguration held easter morning an angel rolled the stone away the son of god rose i am so glad all that great inoculation that would give it for us tonight that people when they become inoculated they act funny usually they do when something some happens substantially it makes them become funny he said that when they take this shot strange thing they all got drunk looked like they were drunk they were dancing and acting like a bunch of drunk people and they said the people that wasn't inoculated said these men are full of new wine oh my how many females are inoculation tonight a feeling of the holy ghost tonight the call of god that come into your life no preacher can hold that back that is yours that is your promise thanks for the kingdom of god no man could cut you from that that is your promise the promise of the holy ghost oh my and when paul made these disciples that believe in jesus and begin to tell them about the holy ghost they say we ain't even know about this holy ghost and you're talking about and paul said how were you baptized and the baptists on the journey said no they'll be baptized again and then they were baptized and they were filled with the holy ghost and the question that was asked is have you been inoculated have you received the holy ghost since you believe he said i don't even know about this inoculation i didn't know since the coming message the other guy injection yeah inoculation of course you have the inoculation this is the power of the holy ghost run to your vein this is what make you abram royal seed the seed of abraham wasn't just isaac and ishmael christ was the real seed of abraham it's a fake seed and that faith was confirmed by circumcision and the circumcision and is the circumcision of our hearts by the holy ghost the gospel wanted circumcised even the child of israel we know they were had the sign of circumcision and there were babies born to them in the wilderness what did god do when they cross over jordan well i think it was in joshua chapter five all those children that were born in in the journey had to be circumcised also so it's not because in the land and the land i don't need this and i don't need that no no no no go out of the way you come by pass that away you have to be circumcised there is a promise of the holy ghost for you have you been inoculated have you received the holy ghost since you believe you believe god know you believe you have a heart to believe god gives you that seed inside of you to receive but have you received the holy ghost since you believe you have a power to come inside of you that holy ghost is to give you power to live a holy life i want to pray for what the press i want to overcome or what to say i am sorry you know what your power to do that it are people now cannot say i'm sorry but it's a power to say i am sorry power to say please forgive me a power to do that a literal power oh god help us tonight what do you think will make the church come together in the unity of the field it will take a power because the spirit of man is what is hindering the unity the spirit of man is what have all these this this walls and these protections and these barriers that ministers set up and the spirit of god going to fall so much that the ducks will have fellowship god will flood this message with his presence with his spirit which is power it will transform every single thing oh blessed be the name of the lord have you received the holy ghost since you believe brahma says you cannot receive it until you know what it is you cannot receive it until you know it is given for you you cannot receive it until you know what results it brings you'll know what you get when you get it no false spirit and if ever there was a time that you could see a manifestation of falseness and false prophets and false spirits is now you see men scrambling because the coroner virus flattened all these supermen flatting them like pancake all who is a mystery man all who feel they're adopted all they feel their power all they feel is many prophet meanings on a man many whatever they want to be god flattened them with like a pancake with hispanic nobody have this could step forward and say i am this i am that in the other god flatten the entire world because the whole system about to change and you will order what you think is happening canes children listen carefully the devil's children cain's children is who is in charge of computer and technology this same technology that people getting dependent on and worshipping on the altar of man's invention that they don't even need god because technology making everything almost instant instant communication instant talking everything phone everything any part of the world all of that is is a plan all of that is the system behind it the whole entertainment industry the whole style and fashion is controlled by the enemy it has nothing of god behind it and that is why you have to be completely delivered from the styles and fashions and the influences of this world because the influence the only way the system could change everything must be in place when brother branham got the vision of the cars moving on its own operating by a power by a radar he says and he wasn't getting on any accident the technology had us to be here for that to be possible it took all these years to bring computer technology to the point where this vision can materialize because it has to have a time for everything and just as the vision of the car materialized brother branham saw abducted sons because he was the wave sheath and the wave sheath means that other sons come into maturity so this power is not a paper thing it's not a reference point to say well god is already profit and this happened that happened no god has to be with the bride and demonstrate that power because that is what the gospel is about the gospel is not simmons the gospel is the demonstration of the power of god with signs and wonders according to what mark 16 20 the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with wit wit not more word with not more mysteries with not more revelations with signs wonders and miracles and people don't want to talk about that but god does that he's the same yesterday to the unfair year you're a sinner yes saved by god's grace elected to beginners are we are not staying our sinners we come to be redeemed and we didn't come by the blood so the power we have tonight is not in ourselves but by the blood and the blood gives you access to access his presence to access his throne that accesses mercy that is what this blood is all about so you have to go and get the inoculation all the way not whether it's top or bottom is from the bottom to the top from faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness right or not to the charity you have to get the whole thing and that inoculates you to the point where the bible said we shall not all sleep this is the first time that the grim reaper is properly challenged that dick can't touch this bride oh glory to god you should be shouting tonight i'm telling you something the grave is not for everybody it's a bride that's going to be raptured and a rapture already happened enoch i'm the enoch it happened to elijah are you going to happen to the bride so what we see has already been oh glory hallelujah what is to come has already been enoch was raptured elisha was raptured and you are going to be raptured you have a promise we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed there's somebody to fulfill that when the bible says virginia shall conceive somebody else to fulfill that so by the grace of god so tonight this was like a special i wouldn't say well bio study in a true sense of how we would go things but i felt i needed to address and talk to you about what people keep asking should i go should i inoculate and whatnot and the thing of it is that um the virus want to survive so that is why the virus mutates it wants to survive it wants to spread its wings it wants to continue inflicting economize what satan does and that does and these diseases does trying to give people a premature uh uh uh advanced trying to take you in advance when your life have put personality if you could cut you off he will cut you off that's what he tried to do with moses baby moses kill all the children try to do with jesus kill the children kill them kill the potential kill what you could become kill and cancel your vision cancel your purpose that's what killing does you you could die and you're still alive and do you know that the vision and you dying and you're still there but there's nothing there you're physically there but the purpose is not there the drive is not there you're going through the emotions it's just not there but when god revive your spirit revive you because people could be in church and that there is adorable churches kill people here like you're dead and the water of the wood make you even rotten faster because sitting down into it like a log and the water just passing over and afterwards is less than this effect just said you'll make the gospel of non-effect you worship me in vain when you begin to understand the revelation the calling that god put upon your heart and life then you want to worship him in spirit and in truth oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord i will close it be cruising shortly but abram oh my they begin to act different when they receive the holy ghost peter and they were afraid the doors were shut 120 people in a locker room waiting for their vaccination waiting for something from heaven waiting to be inoculated and we know when peter came out and the man was healed and peter said do you think by my strength this man is healed but by faith in jesus name this man is healed and we know afterwards the devil turned over and said no we have to stop this bunch of people and that's where the press come down they say they put some licks on them and beat them thinking they will go and lick the rooms and pack up shop what they did they went to a prayer meeting and said lord god strengthen us quote your spirit upon us transform us anoint our lives and god they were refilled with the holy ghost and that is the birth of the book of acts it wasn't the acts of men it wasn't yakuza bishops popes message popes or otherwise or archbishops it was the act of the holy ghost and men god bring that back philip take me from a revival and led to speak to the ethiopian people who was going back to ethiopia to interpret the scriptures empower him to go back to his country give us where we could be led by the spirit of god direct by the spirit of god no lies god will trade and lies go trading truth you shall know the truth and the true chance that you're free when jesus say i come and now you say you see him but you don't want to follow true you're blind you say but you stay in your sins because you see once light comes to you the choice you have is to stay where you are or walk out of what you're in right now there may be things that you need to walk out of right now because part of going forward is separation god will ever leave people where they are he pulls them out come out abraham come out the country come out from egypt come on come on if you have to go to the next step the next step where god ordained god you have to let go to step you are in and that step is always a fake move because god tells abraham come out onto a land i will show you so it's not that god send them the the cadastral and the whole map and the whole plan it is here from there you walk through here like it's a gps thing and when you're here turn left and right no i will show you so if abraham said lord i am moving until i get the whole hug the whole revelation behold i am moving until you have to move you have to you have to start with your thinking if you're thinking don't move you are moving you have to start with the transformation of your mind if your mind don't change you're not moving you have to start somewhere let's move tonight change your thinking rule your chin can be don't let people who are no god who are called who have no degree who have no science we're not in telling you what to take scientifically somebody said if the vaccine will cause this think about it now people talk about the vaccinating market the business invert that make any sense that is so foolish it doesn't know laughing at that you look at them look at that you see him that is my enemies i hope you understand what the vaccine is what it does it's a lower form of the very same thing to activate the antibodies in your body to fight the disease your body have built in action men and when they get activated they could fight and box and cough and fight back but they get activated to generate these what they call antibodies so when somebody gets vaccinated from smallpox or whatever it is having oily or whatever it is it's something put inside to activate antibodies to defend themselves from these attacks that's what that is about and the point about it is this if we the body can handle that lower form of the of the virus that is injected how your body will have the full blow so to speak that is why i have something called vaccination they always have anti-vaxxers it have people who don't believe in vaccines and man and man and a devil and what kind of thing like that i i can't i can't explain it away from people everybody have their choice everybody have to choose everybody have to pray and ask god to help them i know somebody gave me a testimony that they couldn't really take vaccine because of the health condition as a child but god kept them all these years and so on that is really great i cannot i'm not a doctor so when people ask me a question that is medical i cannot say do this to this forte doctor get medical i'm not a lawyer if somebody have legal issues i'm i can't answer certain things i don't know everything i'm not good you see so you have to have the right authority to that as i say already some people when the doctors say take two pills just show you more than three you'll be able to doctor but you have to come to believe god just like that too take your pills and believe god do you do and believe god go leave god out and just trust science but understand that god uses science uses doctors and so on because they really don't heal they assist in putting things together and so on but god is the healer god wants to heal you tonight question are we closing with this is the obama and gilead is there no physician there then why are my people still sick let us bow heads oh blessed be the name of the lord heavenly father i thank you tonight tonight was like a different night a special night where i fell to talk with your people as i would say have a conversation to talk with them and to share your word with them oh god you took ordinary men men that was born in sin men there were fishermen that men that was in charge of tax collecting and who was fishermen who was cussing and whatever life they were living and you said follow me little would they have known the outcome of the decision to follow the messiah little that these 12 men that grew but have known the gospel would have unfolded for seven ages and for all these years they are now in the dust of the earth their bodies that is waiting for this capstone bride to step forward even job when the revelation broke upon him when the devil saw an opportunity to strip him that he would kiss god and the skin wounds was eating him job raised up with revelation says do the skin wound destroy my body yet in my flesh i shall see god god we we don't know what the future holds you know and that future is our own future we know what is prophesied we know the vision of what is spoken of at that bride that should be a haunted persecuted group we know that every genuine christian every genuine believer at some point in time will conflict with governments like shah jack mitchell bendigo like daniel righteous men all of them because we know the forces of the enemy is what sits in the seat of government and this is not our government but father daniel saw a stone cut out without the hands of man and lord strike the image and the kingdoms of men fell we know the greek roman all the kingdoms one by one that went into its strength eventually fell and one day that final kingdom of man will fall and the kingdom of god will be established once more we belong to that kingdom lord and that kingdom is the word made flesh and made power in our lives father tonight they are weak ones they are struggling words the ones who are indecisive and how to go forward father help them tonight i don't know their hearts i don't know their battles and their troubles and they're wary and they're tired
