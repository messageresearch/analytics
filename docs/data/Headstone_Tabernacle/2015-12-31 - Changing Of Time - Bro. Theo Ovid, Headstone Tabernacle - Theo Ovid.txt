what's before us amen amen the past we can't change Hallelujah but what what what is before us oh yes a lot of things could change depend upon your attitude what's before you in other words the seeds the flowers of Tomorrow is the seeds of today what you going to plan today going to reap tomorrow isn't that right so I'm glad to be here and I'm excited about the service tonight and we're looking forward for great things in the Lord amen I trust that this year was a blessed year in your life and it would have been challenging because that's how it's supposed to be you're supposed to have battles and wars and frustration and depressions and upsets and failures and fallings and slipping and struggles that's how it's supposed to be if it's not like that something is wrong I don't know what but all I know something is wrong if the devil is not doing a good job God he always has been doing a great job all these years and God has always been doing a great job himself because whenever the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God always raise a standard against the enemy I thank God for the special tonight Worthy is the Lamb and and that's what I feel we come to do to give God praise give God honor and give God worship huj hallelujah amen praise God so how do I begin such a great time that's the front of us how do I start Hallelujah tell my wife something you know that's something I read about people love mediocrity because it makes them feel comfortable it doesn't challenge them to exceed and Excel so when you hear the call to Perfection it means you can stay where you are you have to see something higher than you bigger than you something that you could Aspire onto and that's what where standards come and and Perfection and pressing on and overcoming and and and getting out your comfort zone people like to stay in their comfort zone and that is where you are in the humanistic realm where you know there's no pressure on you to perform no pressure on you to be different no pressure on you to exceed and Excel you want to be the greatest father there is you want to be the best wife you want to be the best husband you want to be the best farmer the best mechanic whatever you want you want to be the best if you want to be a bum you want to be the best bum you want to eat out of the worst dust bin you want to have the most the stinkiest clothes you

the morning I die a blessed and happy man and considered a privilege and opportunity to serve you Amen in Jesus name amen you're ready for the word tonight let's all stand three portion of scripture something upon my heart Ecclesiastes chapter 3 1-4 Ezekiel 9 1-6 Revelation 10 1-7 my God just a note if you have your cell phone just make sure it's off Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse one to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven Hallelujah time to be born time to die time to plant time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh amen a time to mourn and a time to dance Ezekiel chapter 9 reading from verse 6 from verse one he cried also in my ears the Lord voice saying cause them to draw charge over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the North and every man slowed a weapon in his hand one man among them was clothed with linen with a wrers ink on by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of the god of Israel was going up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the the man clothed with linen which had the writer's incor by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abomination that be done in the midst thereof and the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have you pity slay utterly old young both mids little children and woman and come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house Revelation chap 10 reading from verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clo with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face as it were the son his feet as pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cry with a loud voice as when a lion roar it when he had cried seven Thunders uttered the voices and when the seven Thunders UT the voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uted and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him who live forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that are therein are and the see and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to song The Mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets let's pray father we thank you for your word inspired to our hearts you know what you put upon my spirit and in my heart today speak to our hearts in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah bless praise God other title it been song very strange but this is what come to my heart tonight and the title is changing of time changing of time and I have an inspiration time of sealing time of judgment another context scripture from Daniel 12:8 and9 when the Lord was opening up the end time to Daniel Daniel said I heard but I understood not then said I oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the End Amen the words are sealed till the time of the end watch that word time of the end but when that Mighty angel came down and swore he said time no longer amen time of the end and the end of time is not the same thing it come like if you're preparing for Christmas and you have a turkey and you have a a chicken and you have it and you want to kill it or whatnot you get it and you put it in the cage that's the time of the end but when you cut his head off that's the end of time for that turkey or that chicken so the time of the end look like a span of time and in that span of time a lot of things have to unfold people would mock it people would laugh at it because they said how long is this time of the end and time of the end but it's the time of the end I don't know how much you have stores with timers in it and that came to me very simply there's a switch for timer and switch for the clock the clock is the time if you're not cooking you just seen the time there but if you're going to do something and you need to put that timer on when you switch it time begins to count it's a countdown where there's something baking in the oven it's a countdown and that is what I saying tonight a changing of time it's as if God pressed the Tim up and they going to come down now and when God press that timer Nothing Stops it amen not to changes it Hallelujah glory to God so we about to moveing a changing of time I have another context scripture from Revelation chapter 7 after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor on any tree we know what that was four angels that was interpreted to us came and stopped World War I that's World War II and it was pressing towards a World War II but it had to stop because the Angels were T to stop the Ws amen isn't that right but I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the seed of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to H the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads amen Hallelujah and I heard the number of them that were sealed now that was the Jews 144,000 but before they are sealed there's a gentile bride to be sealed amen you can't go in without being sealed hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah we can't make it without being sealed Hallelujah the Jews were blinded that we can see they were blinded that we could be covered with the robe of God's Grace So before God go back to the Jews you have to finish with the Gentiles and to finish the Gentiles it has to be the finishing of the seventh seal that's right you may be seated HJ the sick seal is Judgment every age was bted under a seal that's right as it was Hallelujah you are under a seal where you must be sealed Hallelujah the six seal is judgment to be cast onto the Earth amen and in Ezekiel chapter 9 Angels came with a commission to destroy young and old woman children but amidst those angels there was a man Hallelujah with with a inkor writer to put a mark to put a seal to put something upon those that sing and crying and burning and groaning not the sleeping not the am man you're tired and you're weary and you want to give up you can't afford to be tired we to close to the Finishing Line come on say Amen somebody Hallelujah Daniel seeking the Lord from off the words of Jeremiah the prophet amen God sent an angel dispatched to Daniel begin to reveal Mysteries to him and Daniel couldn't catch it because it wasn't the season and time he said go th Way Daniel the book is sealed that's right till the time of the end so anytime that book begin to unfold it's the time of the end going towards the end of time because when that seal breaks the angel come and said time shall be no more time itself is going to end we are breaking into eternity do you know you don't belong here oh glory to God listen time is only a break of Eternity we come from God and we're going back to God you with him before the foundation of the world you come from eternity this world is not your own may see you're fighting to live right and you're living to die putting the energy into what what you putting the energy and effort into what would it count oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah watch notice from the seven seal here we go for the end time message this seal after he read all the six seals and says nothing about the sevenant the end time seal which is the seventh when it starts when it starts it will be a total secret when it starts amen amen hallelujah in other words nobody could pin down it start here it start here when it starts is a secret but he speaks about the finishing of that seventh seal so it's going to start and it's going to finish because Ezekiel eastes tell us to everything under Heaven There is a season and there is a time to everything under Heaven a time to plant a time to to pluck up that which is planted a time to SW a time to reap I would say that a time to seal and a time to [Applause] judge Oh Glory when God was about to judge Sodom he couldn't hold back unfolding the revelation of what he was going to do because Abraham represented the bride elect of that day so God said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do he couldn't hold back those seals from Abraham so God be to break the seals to Abraham that Sodom was [Applause] judged you know when they go and blow up something they have a long line know what make explosive they don't go and light the thing right there by the explosive they blow up with it too that is suicide so they have a long cord and they light it here and the cord is burning burning burning when it hit that it's going to explode well this is what like the seven seal is hallelujah God light it hallu and he walks away and time is unfolding and it's changing over could you imagine people going to bank next day they didn't know judgment was set they didn't know the angel already descended appeared to Abraham revealing Secrets they didn't know s was finish they thought was business as usual Monday morning but Monday morning wasn't coming it was a season being changed and they don't even know it one man representing the bride elect one man named Abraham was getting divine revelation and he be to beg God he said if there is 50 down there would you destroy it God said no Abraham said if there is 40 oh if there is 30 he didn't say they bur them lord judge them Lord no there was a cry for Mercy That's Why Oh Glory come on now help me preach somebody me preach notice notice when God revealed to Abraham that Sodom judgment was set Abraham begin to intercede and begin to cry out if there is 50 Lord our family dear what about my loved ones what about my brother that back what about my [Applause] [Music] sister Hallelujah that was a spiritual man not a caral man saying Thank You Lord you come for me going and get burn I gone no he wasn't in that mode amen no he was in the real Spirit he had the burden he had a had of compassion he went beyond himself amen and because he pleaded and pleaded if there was 20 if there was 10 they couldn't even find 10 listen to what the prophet said about that he said if I could find 10 I'll SP it if I could find 10 as it was in the days of Sodom here we go so shall it be in the coming of the son of man isn't that right not if I could find 10 Methodist if I can find 10 Baptist if I can find 10 Pentecostal if I could find 10 athletes if I can find 10 senators or 10 ministers if I could find 10 righteous there's only one righteous that's Christ Christ Liv in one of them 10 Hallelujah I would not stop it I would stop it if I could find Christ in one so at the end of it this message and all what we striving for and believing for is supposed to do produce Christ in you not not this is me this is me and you see who I am no no that is you who had to die that is the you who God looking to killall what we want to see is Christ in you your husband must see it come on now your wife must see it your children must see it the people in the job must see it the garbage collector must see it come on say Amen somebody see what Christ in you Hallelujah so we know the story God send angels to get lot out that's right and his family out just one word keep walking forward amen forget about the past don't look back don't even look back back at your sins don't look back at your failures don't look back at what parties you went to and where you fail go just keep pressing on just don't look back just keep I'm giving you an open window I'm giving you a way of Escape I'm opening a door for you tonight just don't look back just just keep moving forward forward in faith forward in Grace tell yourself God is speaking to you right now and you're going to be reconciled right back to God nobody could keep you back nobody can hold you back the blood is sufficient for you you have a lawyer inside of here today that lawyer going to defend your case come on he has defended your case he said not guilty Jesus drop your charges your kiss is dismissed and you are [Applause] free news the angel didn't say all had to burn a candle say two Our Father backward and say three Mary it was nothing like that amen amen nothing complex just don't look back just don't look back don't look back now see this is where it comes to the heart amen this is where it displays what's inside of this little something inside of here what's in your heart you see she know she has to come out she started out but there was something in her heart that want me to look back to one more look at the the clothing one more look at the Styles one more look at the Fashion there's one more lust inside of there to look back to she turned to pillar salt and Jesus said whenever there's gospel preach Jesus said remember Lot's wife just just don't forget that remember L's wife there an end time message remember L's wife remember L's wife when you start off don't even look back oh hallelujah praise God sudden burning praise God see them movies them fell I said the fire burning behind them and the star walking out sh that is only gimick you know the STS always escap you know bomb here bomb here gun shooting here shooting here shooting here n hitting them and they walking out and and they had drama walking out fire behind them that's in the movies and only the movies only Hollywood have that in reality it doesn't have that but I'm saying the angel came to bring a way of Escape before judgment that got be Mercy I know people bring gospel and judgment and judgment trying to fighten the people out and whatnot I'm not trying to do that tonight I'm bringing a word to you amen that there's a changing of time yes sir here what Jesus said they eat they build they got married no visible sign of the end do you get what Jesus said he didn't say people were piping Coke and look like the crazy that looking right now he said they eat the bill they sold they bought houses they settled they had dinners they had birthdays anniversaries they had Weddings But the day no went into the ark the day L came out then judgment came Hallelujah you can't use your eyes to discern the time and the time and the seasons amen you don't use your eyes it will fail you youve got to take the word you can't even use your feelings think about it every one of you here tonight have an opportunity to be correctly reconciled to God it is only your choice walking out this building will determine where you end up you don't have to leave here the same way you came you don't have to go back and do what you have done you don't have to you are free moral agent placed here by God with decisions and choices in your heart you may be SE you could choose to forgive or you could choose to hate you could choose to drop your stuff or you could choose to hold your hearts you could choose to break out and give God a shout in the house or you could D mop in your circumstance that's up to [Applause] you Hallelujah Hallelujah from SS in prison he says see the names are on the book of life he had to stand there because it was God's purpose to redeem them their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and the lamb who was slain which was Jesus had to stay and make intercession isn't that right because what the church was predestinated to be without spot or wrinkle she is going to be there and the lamb died for that purpose and then when the last name on that book was redeemed the lamb came forth and took the book so we always say it like that you're going to buy furniture you make your payment in courts you pay for the furniture but you have to go and pick it up you have the receipt but this is what Redemption is like the lamb already paid the price he just said pick it up yet don't think you got that you pay for the furniture but it's still in the store you have the receipt you have the title you have the evidence of purchase and his blood was the evidence of purchase so therefore everybody supposed to loose their faith because you didn't redeem yourself you can a clean thing a unclean come from a unan a clean come from unclean we came from unclean it took his blood to clean us up we were born in sin so you can't sit here like some self-righteous somebody we were born in sin and all have sin not some and come short of the glory so don't sit there like you are Pope Francis thinking he is above everybody else don't sit there like that Hallelujah you are saved by the grace and by the blood but

of the world as a gene thought Hallelujah you bypass your word because a word is a thought expressed so you bypass your expression and came into flesh so therefore you have to connect back to the word so God had to bring the word to reconnect you so in every age there was a word to make the connection and the devil couldn't understand that Myster how the gospel could be preached and you get connected with the word a word in season a word in due season every age had a message every age had a word every age had a messenger every age had a people to receive that word and when they got that

that was put in the book Jesus came to redeem here we go and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed this angel came in with a mighty book with a book open Hallelujah the book was open because there names to be called out of that book you see Adam was to speak the word into Eve Amen to speak another son but because Adam fell it went into sex but Jesus came and say you must be born again of the word and of the spirit so he bring it right back to the word so even though you have a natural birth you have to get another birth to come back to the word because sons are born by the

of God as Daniel heard the seven Thunders and forbidden John heard the voices this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with Seven Seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God will be finish in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed and listen and when that was completely revealed
