tonight any negative thing anybody brings to you brother Braham was praying for a woman and the woman came on a prayer line and she was coming because a man that prophesied to be or professed to be a a minister a pastor her own pastor had already told her her that she's a witch and when she came before the prayer line a black handkerchief was dangling around the woman this was in the vision he was seeing the woman and seeing everything and then he said that's a lie Satan is a liar it's time he tries to get people to say things that are not of you to make you f hot and sometimes you get hot then he got you because he knows you are hot then he crosses his legs and he he smiles when such a thing comes Braham said don't you ever receive any negative thing any man says to you you send it back to

but your predestinated will you sent us a prophet to drop down unmerited predestinated Grace as our wedding band that we had been engaged to Jesus Christ and father we are looking for consumation father bring down the Holy Ghost tonight that's the that's the main issue if we can only be filled for those who are looking for God tonight Jesus I pray there Lord you look upon the people tonight

little bit thank you very much well I'm excited tonight I am feeling good and when I feel good the Holy Spirit feels good I'm really feeling good tonight I'm high up in my spirit thank you for the atmosphere in the meetings amen I want to thank God for all the ministers I want to also thank brother Charles for hosting this meetings thank you for your burden of love for your little contribution to the kingdom of God may God bless you and your family and your church amen amen so greetings from back home the little church in freet toown we thank God for the grace of God and the church asked me to give the convention their greetings and on behalf of my wife sister s Sweet s s we're happy to be Ino we love you and we thank God for this time of Fellowship I'm trusting God that God make this moment an eternal moment with God so we can meet God face to face I I know the challenges many of us face We believe We Believe see have to preach adoption and the first part of adoption is to place the position the believer in position see because scripturally all things are supposed to be possible to them that believe so belief should make way for possibilities so that takes a positioning and so but Bram had to be given a voice and that voice was an angel a manifestation to make belief possible and that should be our position when you say I'm Healed you are healed because that's the only way belief grows if you keep believing and nothing is happening it kills your faith many people get the backslide because many are Christians for so long and they've never had a miracle from God they don't even will know what a miracle is and that makes it hard for your faith to grow this morning you cannot function properly as a Christian without the supernatural we've tried to underplay it but you can't underplay the supernatural because that's your real origin and what becomes spiritual Faith to your heart must must first be a mental Faith because perception is reality virtuality is reality so all your what you call virtual is really real because man is always a product of his imagination so what you conceive in your mind is what you become so if your mental faith is right it affect your physical as well so we thank you for all the preachers so I'm trusting God by the time this service is over you experience the greatest Miracle a change of being a change of life not just a struggling Christian but one that knows I met God face to face Jesus changed my life you can pinpoint your miracle and where it's coming from can somebody say Amen to that church and when you put your finger to your Miracle the devil cannot deny that because God is always there to back it up that is my bath that's where I'm coming from can somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah praise God Amen so shall we stand to our feet I want to thank God for brother AK the convention was open with prophetic aons that this this meeting nothing will overshadow you than the Holy Ghost I believe God will honor that tonight I want also thank for all the ministers the things to preach I believe all the previous meetings was RA your faith up into the spirit because once you get into the spirit you begin to function normally then to be a Christian becomes normal you don't have to struggle anymore because you are back in position as a Believer can somebody say Amen to that church so therefore let's turn to the Bible tonight I have a little subject on a little thought I won't stay very long sons of God coming back but the the said manifested Sons most step out by faith so tonight we stepping out by faith but I have one inspiration from Exodus chapter 7 God told Moses he said see I've made the a god unto Pharaoh so tonight let's turn to first of all the book of um Romans chapter 8 praise God hallelujah thank you brother Olu for this morning brother dly that was a newly discovered gift go God bless you brother appreciate your tast on the word of God Amen brother thank you very much bringing us back to the Covenant confirmation of the Covenant amen Romans chapter 8 I'll read from verse 19 I would like to see if I would just continue on from where brother left this morning is is a is a good player he knows how to lay the ball right on your feet I think it's like Missy and somebody else you just know how to lay the ball on track so he has a way of he has a way of bringing the word and it just makes it easier to score goals so so tonight it makes it easier for me to score goals tonight and we're going to score some goals tonight can somebody say amen hallelujah Glory Romans chapter 8 it reads on his wise he said for the honest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope but because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the chain of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body hallelujah hallelujah I want to quickly give you a scripture let I forget from Psalms chapter 16:5 keep it in your mind Psalm 165 the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my C thou maintainers my Lord the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my C and let's quickly turn to the book of um Exodus this was God calling Moses for a commission sending Mo giving Moses Comm to go to to Egypt Exodus chapter 7 hallelujah praise God I'm coming there tonight amen and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aon thy brother shall be thy prophet Thou shalt speak all that I command thee and Aon thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh that he send the children of Israel out of his land and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders the land of Egypt so God was telling Pharaoh how he would do it but we understand when God Called Moses to send Moses forth Moses had a challenge his challeng was taking back this message is not a problem but how would they believe me how will they know you send me how will they believe me amen and so God had to give Moses two signs so the giving of the two signs was for the people to believe Moses because the principle of faith faith that the angel told theam if you can make the people to believe you that's a principle that's why you see say people go which doctors they they will be healed like in the days of the Beatles people on wheelchair stepping to their show and they walked out of those whe and they came the and ask you said only God heals how can people go to the be in their show and they walk out of their richs because it's the faith because Faith Works by a law and every law is only Guided by a principle so if the principle of faith is right God will always meet you on that principle can somebody say Amen to that somebody say Amen to that church praise God Amen so God told Moses of made the a go un to Pharaoh he said but Pharaoh shall not hacking unto you on sorry please okay okay so he said I will hacken Pharaoh's and will multiply my signs and my wonders in land of Egypt but Pharaoh shall not hacken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my armies and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgment and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them may God bless this word tonight may be seated amen so as I just said tonight I want to see if I can come up from where the left up the night and I pray God gives us Faith tonight to receive one from the Lord why do we like to go back to Genesis account because that's our origin we will never know our beginning our true beginning until we go back to Genesis and by the Bram took us even beyond that and took us back to before things actually began Before Time began before Angels were even created before the Earth was even created before there was a heaven said we existed and that gives our existence our Eternal past and eternal quality and until that is drilled back into your heart it will be hard for you to have faith because the Holy Ghost doesn't make you a son the Holy Ghost only comes to confirm your sunship because your sunship or something go deep back in his mind it took a prophet to identify where we come from there were the seven SE books came with an abstract said the abstract actually means something that could search it way all back to the beginning so so so I our beginning in real in real sense before even God started saying let there be we already existed and brother Bram tried to give quality to to our thoughts in God because everything you see on the face of the Earth was actually a thought in God because because of God's only signs God knows everything brah says even how many times the fly will B it eye that's how complex God's mind is all these things going on in the Middle East all these Isis boys God knows about them but that thought did not make up an attribute Lucifer was also in God's mind all the angels that fell they were in God's mind but when a thought becomes an attribute that's different thought so connected our thinking in God as an attribute meaning that we are not just like thoughts that exist in God's mind but our thought was God's very nature that's really who we are that's my identity can somebody say Amen to that you have a choice to either believe that or don't believe that that is the Eternal section of the book brah opened the books of Life there is a regular section in this message I've had Pentecostal preach many preach but they are preaching from the regular section C just a regular life but in this same M there's an eternal section a section in God that did not begin the prophet connected you there that is your connection and only brother Bram could do [Music] that only the prophet now listen like brother de was bringing for justification justification says you never seen the scripture says we all have seen if you if you take that scripture from the humanistic your reasoning will tell you all the mistakes you've made how do you believe you didn't never really see but in the Holy Ghost because only God didn't s so he that is born of God cannot [Music] sin love oh once lost but now I found was blind but now I see let me see that so our origin even goes beyond the Holy Ghost said the Holy Ghost is even a temporal gift he said the real gift is your soul that existed before there was a spirit and you see gave quality to our soul the all spoke this morning on Spirits we were not just Spirit but you see in our spirit Soul was this thing called theophany a theophany gives quality to your soul it frees that soul from deception and fals hold because a theophan knows all things and only God knows all things that is a catgory the angels that fell that was deceived in heaven they were spirit that came out from God but that Spirit the nature of that Spirit they didn't have a theophany if they had a theophany they would not have been deceived they would have known that Lucifer is not God so even though they were spirits but the quality of their nature the quality of your nature of your soul is the same as the nature so the quality of a man's spirit is what his soul knows can somebody say Amen to that can somebody say Amen to that soam said where we want lived in our souls we lived in this thing called theophany he said when God created man he created him a theophany that is why Adam could not be deceived says Adam Soul though it was a city form but it was a theophany you can't deceive a theophany you cannot light with theophany the theophany content in your soul is what frees your soul from falsehood and from deception can somebody say Amen to that church that is your [Music] class see see man God man had two Consciousness there's a lower self-consciousness that was Adam's 27 man the humanistic consciousness but Adam had a higher self so Adam's ultimate was not justly what will he was went way back Beyond his Earthly [Music] limitations because Adam had a self up in heaven which is what we call Genesis 126 that was his God self so when God put genesis6 came to show the connections because before Adam even became before God formed him from the earth Adam was already moving of even after God formed him from the Earth was already there it was leading the animals like the Holy Ghost leads the church [Music] today but Adam was not still a conscious was not still he was not he didn't have consciousness of the higher self so God had to make the connection and when that connection came on Adam he became a living Soul then he had a higher self-consciousness then he knew he was not only a humanistic person even though in his body was made in the image of animals but there was something in him higher than his lower self and that was the god PA that was the God created path can somebody say hallelujah so you see when Adam fell when Adam fell Adam lost consciousness of this higher self and that's why you need the Holy Ghost because if the Holy Ghost doesn't come you can only see yourself relative to the humanistic that's your height that who you are but there's not the self of you that is in the spirit can somebody say hallelujah these things is speaking about this God Parts you are a part of God you are a gene of God you need to experience that other part that part that relate you to God if that part is not there there's no connection you are still human say you can only live in humanistic real can somebody say Amen to that church and that's why the Holy Ghost is so important but the ho gave a Cod this morning when the Holy Ghost come to your hand you become a twofold being any man that receive the Holy Ghost knows a being stepping to you another man stepping to you hallelujah praise God it was not just a spirit when I receed the Holy Ghost a being is Ste into me I knew a being came by me and that being has kept me life all this way no man can challenge that I am a holy ghost fill man that is my higher self that is my next self and when I get up into that way anything is possible can somebody say hallelujah that is why you need to have the Holy Ghost to function in that realm May me see that may me see that let me see [Applause] that now when as long as Adam had this higher self consciousness in the state of his higher self he he had unrestricted access to fellowship and that's why Jesus Christ came to show you the kind of Fellowship that Adam had with God Jesus in St John 59 could say the son can do nothing of himself but what is father do and the father loves the son and show the son all that he doeth so you can't have you can't your your faith can't be potent if you not if you don't have a relationship with God your fellowship with God you see because Jesus why his faith was potent God will tell Jesus what to do next what he should do the next second the next minute the next day the next week Hallelujah that was how Adam was he didn't just give those names to Those Animals by himself he was under divine order how to name this animal how to name this animal so his faith was active when he fell he can longer access Fellowship he now had to come through a mediator and that's how that's how we are opting now through a mediator but how can a TR son for you to talk to your father except you have a mediator that's why the blood age has to come to an end the age of mediation has to come to an end because when sons of God take back that book when the fullness of God comes in you hallelujah praise God the entire Holy Ghost comes into the church Hallelujah then what is now a Mery seat becomes a judgment seat because the entire life of God comes back into the church can somebody say Amen and that brings an end to the blood age then we wouldn't need any longer a mediator to mediate between we and God that access between you and God in terms of Fellowship is taken off so when Adam loed his higher Consciousness when he fell from this higher Consciousness he lost his access to Fellowship that was why he could not run from God and how can any Christian or Minister have faith when God is not talking to you you're only talking to yourself you're only praying to yourself you can't have faith because the voice the living world is what gives Faith you can go on your knees and pray and God speaks back to you and God tells you do this do this do this and you know you cannot fail Hallelujah can somebody shout hallelujah when Adam lost his fellowship with God his faith went down then his un limited or is is the free access he had to the tree of life was taken away from him because God put Jobim to B then his Dominion to the Earth was also lost he became an ordinary man he became a five sense man he he begin to live his life in partial realization he lost his perfect Consciousness he lost really who he was in the spirit he became a slave but God came to restore us back to that that is what our restoration is not complete until we go back to Eden where our fellowship with God is no longer rest at all you can access God at any time and God can speak to you you can speak back to God because that is sunship where a man can step on the pulit and say the Holy Ghost said and say God said these are the men we need for the hour and we are coming up to that church Hallelujah the fful ministry will be men that will have t of the Lord because the prophet of the Bride must have either dust the Lord or she keep still and this is our season that we can stay forward and say God said these are manifested Sons these are real sons of God let me see them let you [Applause] seated seated you see right now your portion of Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is our inheritance way back before the beginning God divided himself into one seeds those then are each portion of those world seed was God himself it's like Peter said who Christ said who do me say I of man I am Peter's Revelation was prophetic he said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God you can't have sons outside son of man so it was the same Jesus son of man that came back in act chapter 2 and divided himself and gave each man a portion of himself putting them back into the Holy Spirit bringing them back to their higher self their higher Consciousness their perfect realization because in that state you cannot see let somebody say hallelujah that is your true stch of justification because the Holy Ghost in you the seed in you has never seen you can't impute it to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is your state of innoc the Holy Ghost your state of perfection and the Holy Ghost you are inging in the Holy Ghost you never SE Hallelujah when the Holy Ghost comes upon you sin Consciousness goes away hallelujah praise God then you don't have to walk fearing to fall to make a mistake no the Holy Ghost is there it leads your footsteps it guides your footsteps it gives you power it's a realm of [Music] consciousness let me see that people do many wrong things to me but I'm not just conscious of hurt that's the honest truth you can't really hurt [Music] me I don't understand this thing hurt me I might know you say something wrong but once I get in my spirit it I feel comfortable that is what the Holy Ghost does it will T your turnue it will give you selfcontrol you won't just talk anyhow because there's a Superman on top of you that controls you it controls your life it conrols your temperament you just don't talk anyhow you are under control can somebody shout hallelujah can somebody shout hallelujah you're not some barar any of us we just get loose well I will tell him off you don't have the Holy Ghost yet if you have the Holy Ghost he won't just let you turn somebody off he will tell you keep quiet don't do it at a time like this you are a child of God because we have to measure up to the image of Christ that is our measure he's the stat praise God Amen so my measure is not a man it's not a minister it is Jesus Christ I must be like Jesus that is my measure that is my standard let me see before I got the Holy Ghost you know I Stam I was very hot tempered very hot temper that's how I knew when the change comes I was a very rough guy but when God filled my soul I realized all my attitude change so I know where I'm coming from I I don't care how low down you are when God comes to you he raises you up to a next level you are no longer ordinary Hallelujah you become a supernatural being let somebody shout amen that is your work with [Applause] God you don't react to issues on the humanistic level because you have a higher consciousness you assess things from the level of that [Music] Consciousness and tonight I prayed for you in my room that God Almighty will give you a genuine experience by the time you leave these meetings you will know that another being is working with you somebody else is working with you Jesus say I'll be with you always you need to experience that you need to know somebody is working with you he's talking with you he's leading you Hallelujah Jesus Christ did not leave you comfortless the comforter is here tonight the Holy Ghost is here tonight that is your higher level of Consciousness once you strike that you are connected back to [Applause] God you become a living Soul then God is vibrating in you you feel God in your body you feel God in your temperament you feel God in your nature hallelujah praise God and that is your desire the seed of God in you is crying out I want an experience experiential Faith let me see that [Applause] [Music] that is man's Divine real when the prophet came back to make the connection until we come to that spot the holy spirit is tonight receive [Applause] it when we measure ourselves in the light of our failures and mistakes we can get nowh are with God that means my stress tonight is this higher P Consciousness whether you are the holy ghost or not that's not the issue just get the Holy Ghost once you get it it will help you understand a lot of things we can't talk on these Divine things from the humanistic realm but the all pray this morning is that we are Angelic beings a man might come back and give you a quat Abraham said God did make us angels and we use that cat to re you of all your angelic substance that is his seed but it's like Paul said in Hebrews 1 which of the Angels said he at any time this is my son and that was Jesus so that was Paul calling Jesus an angel but in sunship he was higher because Paul said which of those angels that God could say they should worship him so even the Realms of angels sunship is different so in the light of your position in God we have the same body as Angels but in position because we are sons of God we are made to be just like God we have the attribut of God inside of us so positionally you are held and [Applause] Angels but we have the same body we have the same thing but in position that's why it is only you that can do the works that I do not angels and even greater Works than this shall you do that commission is not given to Angels it's given to sons of God to impact eternal life how somebody should SE Hallelujah tonight somebody should say hallelujah tonight that is who you [Applause] are imagine a Christian who has been ripped of his Angelic substance and connection how do you operate but BR said before the world began will you say God created my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of that but it was there before the beginning and all of you SE in there and he said those that have the spirit he said they are a part of those Angelic beings that rotated off of God that resisted the devil's lie that's the connection there you can't whip that connection at all so you are candidate of association with angels because God's Doan seed is inside of you wherever you are angels come to minister to you angels are your ministering spirits because you are in a higher order we are sons of God now tell yourself I'm a Son of God say I'm a Son of God if you believe like this tonight then the Holy Ghost can follow you because this message is the manner this is what Angels eat if you don't connect angels to the church they can't come to that [Applause] church if you don't connect Angels if you think the people in your church don't have any Angelic Association what is an angel coming to do [Music] there then your people are dead that is not a Living Church a Living Church must have signs wonders God come down there can somebody shout hallelujah that what I know tonight because you are here God's angels are here what are they here for to minister to you to support you to give you Faith to give you a church because you came from Elohim you came from Elohim let me see that they see that like when the child said things through my Ministry because of what I preach I believe in angels I believe where I I am an angel must visit there that's what I tell God because as I move along I know Angels follow me in the aircraft Angels follow me as I go to town Angels follow me can somebody say hallelujah as I'm preaching Angels follow me glory to God hallelujah and angels are here tonight you shall receive the Holy Ghost you shall be sealed you shall be baptized with fire you shall be healed because why you came from God we are God's attributes Angels were created to serve you so Jesus was not just an ordinary son even though in body in everything he has the form of angels but in status Angels bow down to him that is where you belong as I'm speaking tonight angels will take my word and pack it into your heart because that's why they are here take the message and back it to your heart they minished with Spirit to he of Salvation let SE that let SE that Hallelujah Hallelujah God will drop an atmosphere just now the sick cannot stay sick if you sit on your wheelchair you will step out of that whe chair I challenge you tonight because you were not born for that b chair you will predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son let me seated let me seated we are going to the devil tonight in ribbons he has no place in these meetings he has no place in your life Satan is not invited he has no Hallelujah this meeting is for sons of God and you are coming out [Music] tonight GL be hallelujah praise God Amen you are going to experience God for yourself tonight my God is no dead my God is alive that God still heals that God still seals that God still

of my voice God will give you a tonight let the Devils come against it I challenge Satan tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he can stand your way he can't stand your way he cannot
