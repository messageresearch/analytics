[16:43] 63 verse one says, "Oh God, thou art my
[16:49] God. Early will I seek thee. My soul
[16:53] thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for
[16:56] thee. In a dry and thirsty land where no
[17:00] water is to see thy power and thy glory.
[17:05] So as I have seen thee in the
[17:07] sanctuary because thy loving kindness is
[17:10] better than life. My lips shall praise
[17:13] thee. Thus will I bless thee while I
[17:16] live. I will lift up my hands in thy
[17:20] name. My soul shall be satisfied as with
[17:24] marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall
[17:27] praise thee with joyful lips. When I
[17:31] remember thee upon my bed, and meditate
[17:33] on thee in the night watches, because
[17:36] thou has been my help, therefore in the
[17:39] shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. May
[17:43] God add blessing to the reading of his
[17:45] word. Let us bow our hands as we want to
[17:48] pray and ask God's blessing upon the
[17:51] service this morning. Let's lift our
[17:53] hands. Let's worship him and just enter
[17:54] in this morning. And you create an
[17:57] atmosphere this morning of worship and
[17:58] praise around you that invites the Holy
[18:01] Spirit to minister to you this morning.
[18:04] Uh for that is why we have come this
[18:06] morning. Not for a natural thing but for
[18:08] a supernatural encounter this morning.

[44:00] Amen. Is good to be back home. Praise
[44:04] God. We bring greetings from Ivory
[44:07] Coast.
[44:08] Amen. So, uh it's good to be back home.
[44:12] There's no place like home. They can't
[44:14] deport you from home.
[44:17] They can't say cannot enter. Amen. And
[44:20] one day we be approaching heaven's doors
[44:22] like that. They can't kick us out. The
[44:25] angels have to welcome us. Because we
[44:28] are sons and daughters of the living
[44:30] God.
[44:32] So I want to thank all of you for your
[44:35] support for the Easter meetings here at
[44:37] the headstone tabernacle.
[44:39] I want to certainly appreciate all of
[44:41] you as one sister commented how smooth
[44:44] things were executed in the absence of
[44:46] brother Isaac and myself and it's a sign
[44:49] truly of a growth and I love that we
[44:52] have not injected ourselves into the
[44:54] people.
[44:56] So the church must go on.
[44:59] Amen. Praise God. So we see it and we
[45:01] bless the Lord. Thank you all who
[45:04] participated in the branch. Those who
[45:06] have helped, serve, contributed,
[45:08] supported with bacon, cooking, all that
[45:10] was done to make it such a successful
[45:12] event. I want to say I truly thank you.
[45:16] I praise the
[45:18] Lord. I I want to appreciate also
[45:21] brother Gideon, brother Anthony, brother
[45:22] Steven for standing in the gap to share
[45:25] the word of God with you that could be
[45:28] blessed. And uh the turnout was great.
[45:31] So that shows that you're not coming to
[45:32] see a man or men, but you're coming to
[45:34] hear what God have to say. That's the
[45:37] training that we always desired of you.
[45:40] So if we put on a tape, we bring
[45:42] somebody from outside, doesn't matter
[45:44] who is to speak the word. We are not
[45:46] connected to flesh and blood. I was tell
[45:49] my wife something and say, you know,
[45:50] it's so foolish. All this thing about
[45:52] race is so stupid. It's so dumb. Because
[45:55] the original man is a spirit man. You
[45:58] not seeing me. God put this train that
[46:00] brown dust over this thing. And if if we
[46:02] had to fade away as a skull and and and
[46:05] and
[46:06] and bones there and God could hang
[46:09] yellow flesh around it. God could hang
[46:10] white flesh around it. God could hang
[46:12] black flesh around it. And but the real
[46:14] person is on the inside.
[46:18] It's not this outside man. So people
[46:19] fighting with this outside man. This man
[46:21] have to go back to the ground. You know
[46:22] he said dust thou shalt return. We we
[46:25] like animals in that sense. outside
[46:27] flesh but the inside have a soul and
[46:31] that's where you come in and that's what
[46:32] what what what make you respond to the
[46:34] word of God is what God put inside of
[46:36] you. Oh praise God. So greetings again
[46:40] from Ivory Coast powerful meetings and
[46:43] this morning you're going to hear what
[46:45] we're going to play the last service
[46:46] first last service where Isaac spoke
[46:49] tremendous tremendous meeting and I want
[46:51] to share something before I put on that
[46:53] tape. It's not a long service. So we
[46:55] want to share something before That tape
[46:57] comes on and was saying Noah's time they
[47:00] had great giants and today they got
[47:03] those great intellectual giants in the
[47:05] land too. I hate to say this if there is
[47:08] one here. I hope I don't hurt you. He's
[47:10] talking to if any intellectual giant was
[47:13] sitting there. I don't want to hurt you
[47:14] but it is Satan spies again.
[47:19] in the church is fine. And you say sure
[47:22] intellectual giants come around to prove
[47:25] that all the shouting and saying amen
[47:27] and going to the altar and breaking up
[47:29] because of your sins, that's emotion.
[47:33] That's intellectual talking that they
[47:35] want everything without sensation. They
[47:37] dancing calypos so they going to band so
[47:39] they ain't going football. So they going
[47:40] cricket so they're not going to no
[47:41] sports like that. So but they come to
[47:43] come to church and stone dead.
[47:45] Satan inject them with some kind of com
[47:47] something. But when you come here, you
[47:49] come to worship because that's what
[47:50] Jesus told the woman at the well. And
[47:53] you know, worship is not about your
[47:54] problems and your situations. Worship is
[47:56] about who God is. As long as you
[47:59] recognize who God is, you come to
[48:00] worship him. Sometimes you worship him
[48:02] and he come and bring an answer for you.
[48:04] You worship him and he bless. He's a
[48:05] person. You know,
[48:07] God is not a it. You know, he's a
[48:10] person, you know, a person he could talk
[48:13] to and get answer from. You know, I
[48:15] heard the Lord. He heard my cry. I cry
[48:19] unto him. Oh, glory to God. You could
[48:21] hear you. You know, you could start from
[48:24] where you are. I'm in the pit, Lord.
[48:26] Deliver me. I'm in prison, Lord. Open up
[48:29] them prisons. I am sick. Lord, heal me.
[48:32] I am dumb. Lord, pick me up. I need a
[48:36] revival. I need a breakthrough. I'm a
[48:38] boozer. I'm a drinker. I'm a drug
[48:40] addict. Deliver me. Free me for what I
[48:43] am. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[48:47] Glory to God. Remember, they came out of
[48:49] Egypt, but Egypt didn't come out of
[48:51] them. Glory to God. That's why they were
[48:53] in the condition they were in. You could
[48:55] come out, but the thing that you come
[48:56] out are still inside of you. You're
[48:58] delivered when it get out of you. When
[49:00] your desire has changed. When your
[49:03] nature has changed, when your thinking
[49:05] has changed, then you are changed. Oh,
[49:07] give the Lord some praises. Come on,
[49:09] church. Don't change you. The word does.
[49:12] God does. The fire does. Oh, glory to
[49:15] God. Not your intellectual mind.
[49:18] [Applause]
[49:21] That's intellectual giant. There's no
[49:23] such thing. Walk up, dry eye, say,
[49:25] "Well, I'll join this church. I believe
[49:26] Jesus Christ son of God." Satan does
[49:28] too. And no sign he is saved. That's
[49:30] right. It takes more than that. It takes
[49:33] a new birth. It takes a new birth. Not
[49:36] just saying that it takes something that
[49:37] happens in here that makes you something
[49:39] happening here that makes you different.
[49:41] Amen. Praise the Lord. So the prophet
[49:43] was talking about a rookie in the army
[49:47] packing uh so much of thing on their
[49:49] back for training and whatnot. And when
[49:50] we came to the airport there, I saw so
[49:53] much army people. I don't know. I don't
[49:54] know what they're here for. If they're
[49:56] going to Venezuela, if they coming
[49:57] election, I don't know what they're here
[49:58] for. But if you see some woman there and
[50:00] they packing some
[50:02] big back on their
[50:04] back, I say, "Wow." Oh, we talking about
[50:07] women and men. You know, if you see the
[50:09] size of them things, if you put an back,
[50:12] you fall right down with that. But the
[50:13] train, the army, they not selling snow
[50:17] cone in the army.
[50:20] When you come here, you come here to get
[50:21] in court. So you come here, get a
[50:23] backpack.
[50:25] Not other people monkey on your back.
[50:27] You know, people get people business in
[50:28] your back and you're walking and you
[50:29] have poisons with other people. Don't do
[50:31] that. You know, you have enough of
[50:32] yourself. You know, walk with nobody
[50:34] back.
[50:35] So Bam say he got this new suit on and
[50:38] and 90 lb pack and all these shovels and
[50:41] hand grenades and everything else. He
[50:43] said that is why the all wise God
[50:46] equipped his army with the baptism of
[50:49] the Holy Ghost. He know these
[50:52] intellectual giants would stand in this
[50:55] last day. He know they will stand and
[50:58] they will be able to explain by their
[51:00] great wisdom and the powers of Satan
[51:02] like a roaring the lion. But he said, "I
[51:05] will not leave you comfortless. I am
[51:07] going to be with you." So he equipped
[51:09] his army with the baptism of the Holy
[51:12] Ghost to deal with these intellectual
[51:14] giants. Oh, blessed be. That's why you
[51:17] can't use your mind inside of here.
[51:20] You can't use your feelings. You have
[51:22] feel to come to church this morning.
[51:23] Tell your feelings stay home. We going
[51:25] put your feelings to one side. If you
[51:28] follow your feelings, you get in trouble
[51:29] there. Know there's no feel good. Do it.
[51:31] You know it's what God said. Isn't that
[51:33] right? So, okay. So, they are
[51:36] intellectual giants. They are men, great
[51:38] men, powerful men. They know Greek. They
[51:40] know Hebrew and can set together and
[51:42] settle together. So, intellectual. But
[51:44] where is the revival?
[51:46] Where is that God that burns the heart
[51:50] of the human being? Not how intellectual
[51:53] it is. Here we go. It takes simplicity
[51:55] to bring the power of
[51:58] God. Because we know now all the
[52:01] mysteries and all the crazy revelations
[52:02] and mutual revelations and mighty
[52:04] revelations, it bring down no power. And
[52:06] if you give them a chance next 50 years,
[52:07] they'll be talking the same talk that
[52:09] they talking the last 50 years past. So
[52:11] it will take something to break through.
[52:13] And that is what I want to be pulit in
[52:14] your heart like a beep boop boop because
[52:17] that's that's what Jacob had. You know,
[52:20] Jacob wasn't the best of believer and
[52:21] best he was a trickster. He's a man. If
[52:23] you see Jacob, I no fool with him, you
[52:26] know. But you know what God love about
[52:27] Jacob? He had a heart for the
[52:30] birthright. He had a heart for the Holy
[52:32] Ghost. He had a heart for the things of
[52:34] God. And go I love that man. He
[52:36] trickster now. He doing all kind of
[52:38] skully, all kind of thing now. But you
[52:40] see he I love that man. Because a man
[52:42] who have a heart like that, he could
[52:44] change.
[52:46] You have to have a heart for it. And God
[52:48] already put it in your heart. That's why
[52:50] you're here this morning. You had just
[52:52] come here this morning. He said all who
[52:54] we for we called. All we call it
[52:56] justified. already justified. He already
[52:58] glorified. God had to put the desire
[53:00] inside of you or you stayed just as you
[53:02] are. So you didn't pull yourself. You
[53:04] didn't call yourself. Jesus said it this
[53:06] way. You have not chosen me, but I have
[53:08] chosen you. He chose you as you are. But
[53:10] you're not going to remain as you are.
[53:12] Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight.
[53:15] Hallelujah. You are God's choice. As
[53:17] miserable as you are,
[53:21] as terrible as your behavior is,
[53:25] watch me like I'm not talking to you.
[53:26] we're talking to. Hallelujah. Your mouth
[53:29] loose, but God still choose you. Your
[53:31] behavior this way and that way, but God
[53:33] still choose you. Tell the devil he's a
[53:35] liar this morning. God has chosen
[53:37] [Music]
[53:39] [Applause]
[53:40] me. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I don't
[53:44] know what condition and past and history
[53:46] that shape you as you are to be as you
[53:48] are. That's not important to God.
[53:51] Because when God saw the woman in the
[53:52] well, he wasn't watching with a woman,
[53:53] how much man she had and who she was
[53:55] with and who she wasn't with. He was
[53:56] looking at the seed in her soul. He had
[53:58] the book. He had her name. She know who
[54:00] she was. And God know who you are. Oh,
[54:02] give the Lord some praises. He can bring
[54:04] you out this morning. Oh, he can deliver
[54:06] you this morning. That's why we are here
[54:09] to preach the gospel to every
[54:12] creature. That's why we are here to free
[54:15] to see you loosed from your
[54:16] bands. Almost done here. Hallelujah.
[54:20] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon, there are
[54:22] so many voices in the earth today. That
[54:24] is absolutely a hard thing because it
[54:27] deadens the voice of the supernatural.
[54:29] So therefore, everybody on Facebook,
[54:30] every on Tik Tok, everybody have a
[54:31] voice. Everybody is reporters, everybody
[54:34] trying to do something for likes,
[54:36] laughs, whatever they want to do for,
[54:38] right? So watch something now. There are
[54:40] so many intellectual voices, great
[54:42] voices of mighty man who are
[54:46] intellectual and in their intellectual
[54:48] conditions even shake the nations. They
[54:51] are not overnight people but they shake
[54:54] nations. They bring big floral campaign
[54:57] and a person would be a bit confused and
[55:00] how these things can go on and prosper.
[55:03] And there's voices that raise up that do
[55:04] these things and causes the voice of God
[55:07] to be placed way back somewhere. The
[55:10] true voice of God and the voice of God
[55:12] they say, how will we know it's the
[55:14] voice of God? Because then it was in a
[55:17] vindicated prophet today. How will we
[55:20] know it's the voice of God? Because here
[55:24] we go. It's a manifestation of the
[55:25] prophet's word. Amen. That's how we know
[55:28] it's the voice of God. Not because the
[55:29] man talking 4 hours and 5 hours and
[55:31] explaining the mysteries. That is not
[55:33] the voice of God. That that does not
[55:34] mean that the voice of God. It must be
[55:36] the manifestation of the prophet's word.
[55:38] Here we go. And a true voice of God only
[55:42] brings back that real living
[55:45] supernatural God with his supernatural
[55:47] word with his supernatural sign that we
[55:51] know is the voice of God. There is so
[55:53] much in the other but it will glisten.
[55:55] It will come forth. And the last quote I
[55:57] have here is about David. David was
[56:00] sent, we know to face Golad. Golad, one
[56:03] of them giants in the land. And then B
[56:05] said this here. And and and when David
[56:07] was about to leave, that's when Golad
[56:09] came for. He didn't know Golad was
[56:10] around. He just saw those brothers
[56:12] sharpening the sword and whatnot. And
[56:13] they're not looking up. They're just
[56:16] sharpening. That people sharpening
[56:18] because the challenge of Goliath was
[56:21] send me send a man to fight me. And you
[56:24] cannot defeat what you're not prepared
[56:26] to confront.
[56:28] So burying a head in the sand doesn't
[56:30] deal with your issues or doesn't deal
[56:32] with your giants. You have to understand
[56:34] there's a giant and I have to deal with
[56:35] it. I don't know how. I don't know when.
[56:38] I don't know what. But it has to be
[56:40] dealt with. And you have to confront
[56:42] your demons. You have to confront your
[56:44] giants. You have to confront your
[56:45] issues. I say confront it. Not dock it.
[56:48] Confront it. Not putting it back in your
[56:49] mind. Confront it. Deal with it. Oh,
[56:52] glory to God. This is the age. When I
[56:53] was a child, I talked like a child. I
[56:55] spoke like a child. But when I became a
[56:57] man, I put up with childish things. You
[56:58] have to deal with things as a man. So
[57:01] David give the testimony. I had a bear.
[57:03] I deal with it. I had a lion. I deal
[57:04] with it. That goliath going to be just
[57:06] like them things there. Give the Lord
[57:08] some praises. Glory to God. And then the
[57:11] prophet begin to prophesy. He said God
[57:13] is got a lot of sheep that gone astray.
[57:16] Organization that stole them out,
[57:17] brought them into psychology. God, give
[57:20] us David's with the word of God and the
[57:23] power of God to direct it when we go and
[57:26] meet these intellectual giants. Give me
[57:28] the word of God and the power of the
[57:30] Holy Ghost. And I tell you, we can slay
[57:33] every giant on the field. Praise God. So
[57:35] this morning, I know you're going to be
[57:37] blessed. The inspiration that I had was
[57:40] every giant must fall. Oh, praise the
[57:42] name of the Lord. Let's all stand as we
[57:44] want to go straight into the tape now.
[57:46] It's not a long tape, but you'll be
[57:47] blessed this morning. God bless you.
[57:48] going straight to the the Ivory Coast.
[57:50] Praise the Lord.
[58:00] for the name of the
[58:04] Lord. I
[58:08] power the
[58:12] [Music]
[58:19] righteous. I bless the name. I bless the
[58:23] name. Blessed be the name. Blessed be
[58:27] the lamb of the
[58:31] Lord.
[58:33] Hallelujah. Bless the name. Bless be the
[58:37] lamb. Oh, blessed be the name. Bless be
[58:41] the name. Blessed be the name of the
[58:47] Lord. The lord is savior.
[58:52] [Music]
[59:08] sing. Hallelujah.
[59:18] Oh, I
[59:23] said
[59:27] oh
[59:30] [Music]
[59:42] baby I
[59:50] [Music]
[59:55] God
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:00] listen to him face to
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:08] face where there be no more.
[1:00:13] We
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:17] don't
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:25] see
[1:00:27] where no more we shall be
[1:00:31] changed. Shall be
[1:00:33] changed in the same
[1:00:36] place. Hallelujah to the worship of
[1:00:39] praise.
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:51] The
[1:00:52] Lord
[1:00:54] sacrifice we
[1:00:58] are
[1:01:02] we hallelujah.
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:11] We

[1:01:27] praise that
[1:01:32] praise. Do you
[1:01:34] love you?
[1:01:39] Your Christianity
[1:01:43] is
[1:01:51] [Music]
[1:02:00] we shall be changed.

[1:02:40] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:45] Are you happy tonight?
[1:02:48] Glory.
[1:02:50] Amen. You may be seated for a few
[1:02:52] minutes.
[1:02:53] [Applause]
[1:03:00] Amen. Amen. What a great time in the
[1:03:04] presence of the
[1:03:09] Lord. Are we happy to be here at the
[1:03:12] convention?
[1:03:15] Have we been blessed?
[1:03:20] Amen. I would like to greet you tonight
[1:03:22] one more
[1:03:24] time in the precious name of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ.
[1:03:29] And I want to thank you all.
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:33] making the convention the
[1:03:37] convention. Without you there is no
[1:03:41] convention. So we salute the bride of
[1:03:44] Christ in our
[1:03:48] presence for your
[1:03:50] faith for your
[1:03:52] fire for the
[1:03:54] anointing for making a church. I will
[1:03:57] make a revival.
[1:04:01] And we know without a shadow of a
[1:04:05] doubt he who started the
[1:04:09] work is more than able to bring it to
[1:04:13] pass. So we love
[1:04:16] you. We appreciate you. I want to salute
[1:04:20] brother Paul one more
[1:04:23] time for the vision
[1:04:26] to have the convention.
[1:04:30] We love you brother Paul,
[1:04:32] your family, the church.
[1:04:35] Amen. Amen. And all the helps and
[1:04:38] governments.
[1:04:40] There's a lot that goes into a
[1:04:42] convention
[1:04:46] and we don't ever want to take it for
[1:04:48] granted.
[1:04:50] You know, one of these
[1:04:52] days we'll have our last
[1:04:57] service. One of these days
[1:05:00] we'll sing our last
[1:05:02] song because one of these
[1:05:05] days this battle will be all over.
[1:05:10] But until that time
[1:05:13] comes, we will do everything we
[1:05:17] can for the kingdom of the Lord.
[1:05:21] You may be
[1:05:23] seated. I want to take one more
[1:05:26] time to salute the servants of God,
[1:05:32] the Levites
[1:05:34] who carried the ark of the covenant
[1:05:38] and brought the word of God to us this
[1:05:40] week.
[1:05:42] Brother Solomon Nachina,
[1:05:45] brother Stephanos,
[1:05:48] brother
[1:05:49] Theo, you appreciate the men of God.
[1:05:54] And we thank the Lord for
[1:05:59] that. What services?
[1:06:02] What an anointing.
[1:06:05] You may be seated.
[1:06:07] And tonight it's the final
[1:06:11] service. It's amazing how quickly the
[1:06:14] time goes
[1:06:16] by. Felt like the first service we were
[1:06:20] just in the first service.
[1:06:23] We already in the final
[1:06:26] service. But by the grace of
[1:06:29] God, we are here to do one thing.
[1:06:33] Give the devil one more
[1:06:37] punch. We are here to give the devil the
[1:06:41] knockout punch.
[1:06:44] And for you who are
[1:06:48] here, this knockout punch may not even
[1:06:50] be for you.
[1:06:53] It could be for your family.
[1:06:56] It could be for your
[1:06:57] son. It could be for your
[1:07:00] daughter. So if you didn't give it your
[1:07:03] all in all the previous
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:08] services, a few moments before the
[1:07:10] prayer
[1:07:12] line. I don't care if you use your
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:16] hand. If you use your
[1:07:19] feet, it doesn't
[1:07:22] matter. One more knockout
[1:07:25] punch for the honor and glory of God.
[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:35] So if we could take off, if we could
[1:07:38] stand for the reading of the
[1:07:42] word. By the grace of God tonight,
[1:07:46] I want to preach a message of
[1:07:50] faith before the prayer
[1:07:53] line and we will see what God will
[1:07:57] do. I have two portions of
[1:08:01] scripture. Reading from the book of
[1:08:04] Matthew and reading from the book of
[1:08:06] Joshua.
[1:08:09] One verse in Matthew,
[1:08:12] chapter 1 verse
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] one and Joshua 14.
[1:08:19] Matthew 1 verse one, the book of the
[1:08:23] generation of Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:08:25] David, the son of Abraham.
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:34] Reading Joshua 14
[1:08:37] and reading from verse
[1:08:40] six. Then the children of Judah came
[1:08:43] unto Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son
[1:08:46] of Jeffa the Kennzite said unto him,
[1:08:49] Thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[1:08:51] said unto Moses, the man of God
[1:08:53] concerning me and thee in Kadesh Bania.
[1:09:08] 40 years old was I when Moses, the
[1:09:10] servant of the Lord, sent me from
[1:09:12] Kadesha to espy out the land, and I
[1:09:15] brought him word again as it was in mine
[1:09:18] heart.
[1:09:27] Nevertheless, my brethren that went up
[1:09:29] with me made the heart of the people
[1:09:32] melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my
[1:09:34] God.
[1:09:41] And Moses sway on that day, saying,
[1:09:44] Surely the land whereon thy feet have
[1:09:46] trodden shall be thine inheritance, and
[1:09:48] thy children's forever, because thou
[1:09:51] hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
[1:10:03] And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me
[1:10:05] alive, as he said these 40 and five
[1:10:08] years, even since the Lord spake this
[1:10:10] word unto Moses, while the children of
[1:10:13] Israel wandered in the wilderness. And
[1:10:15] lo, I am this day four score and five
[1:10:18] years old.
[1:10:32] As yet I am as strong this day as I was
[1:10:35] in the day that Moses sent me. As my
[1:10:38] strength was then, even so is my
[1:10:40] strength now for war, both to go out and
[1:10:44] to come in.
[1:10:52] Now therefore give me this mountain
[1:10:55] whereof the Lord spake in that day. For
[1:10:57] thou heardest in that day how the
[1:10:59] anarchims were there and that the cities
[1:11:01] were great and fenced. If so be the Lord
[1:11:04] will be with me, then I shall be able to
[1:11:06] drive them out as the Lord said.
[1:11:21] And Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[1:11:24] Caleb the son of Jeffa Hebron for an
[1:11:27] inheritance.
[1:11:32] Hebron therefore became the inheritance
[1:11:34] of Caleb the son of Jeffa the Kennzite
[1:11:37] unto this day because that he wholly
[1:11:39] followed the Lord God of Israel.
[1:11:49] And the name of Hebron before was
[1:11:51] Kathaba, which Aba was a great man among
[1:11:54] the Anakims, and the land had rest from
[1:12:04] war. May the Lord had a blessing to
[1:12:08] you. Shall we pray? Our gracious
[1:12:11] heavenly father,
[1:12:13] We thank you
[1:12:15] tonight for this last service.
[1:12:19] And Father, we pray that your Holy
[1:12:22] Spirit would take complete
[1:12:25] control. May you walk out the pages of
[1:12:27] the
[1:12:28] Bible. May you speak to your
[1:12:31] people. May you take me out of the
[1:12:34] way. May you raise the faith of the
[1:12:38] people. Lord, as we prepare for the
[1:12:40] prayer line,
[1:12:42] May we take every spirit under
[1:12:46] control for the honor and glory of
[1:12:49] God. May you have your perfect
[1:12:52] way in the precious name of Jesus
[1:12:54] Christ.
[1:12:56] And the church
[1:12:57] says and the church says,
[1:13:01] "Amen." You may be seated.
[1:13:07] So I have a strange title tonight.
[1:13:13] The mystery of Caleb between Abraham and
[1:13:17] David.
[1:13:20] Abraham.
[1:13:21] The mystery of Caleb between Abraham and
[1:13:24] David.
[1:13:26] Abraham.
[1:13:28] And for an
[1:13:30] inspiration, every
[1:13:33] giant must fall.
[1:13:38] Every giant
[1:13:40] must fall.
[1:13:42] And in this
[1:13:44] meeting, we serve notice
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:48] on every
[1:13:50] giant. Because if you read the Bible,
[1:13:54] every
[1:13:54] giant that was found in
[1:13:58] scripture was destroyed.
[1:14:02] Almighty
[1:14:03] God did not
[1:14:05] allow any giant to survive.
[1:14:10] the sons of God
[1:14:12] destroy every giant
[1:14:15] and the church
[1:14:17] say and I believe in this
[1:14:20] convention we are serving
[1:14:23] notice of every
[1:14:25] giant I don't care if that giant is
[1:14:29] sickness I don't care if that
[1:14:34] giant I don't care if that giant
[1:14:39] It doesn't
[1:14:40] matter. Every
[1:14:42] giant must fall.
[1:14:45] We are not
[1:14:47] leaving this
[1:14:49] convention until every
[1:14:52] time. We are not
[1:14:55] leaving
[1:14:57] coast until every
[1:15:00] time the church
[1:15:02] say we serve notice
[1:15:05] tonight. If that giant is
[1:15:09] cancer tonight,
[1:15:11] that
[1:15:12] giant must fall. If that
[1:15:16] giant is high blood
[1:15:19] pressure
[1:15:21] tonight, that
[1:15:22] giant must
[1:15:24] fall. I don't care what the sickness is.
[1:15:29] Every giant,
[1:15:31] every giant,
[1:15:34] not one
[1:15:36] giant survive tonight.
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:48] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[1:15:53] seated for a minute.
[1:15:55] We read that scripture,
[1:15:58] the book of the generation
[1:16:01] of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
[1:16:06] the son of Abraham. So Jesus was pleased
[1:16:12] to identify
[1:16:13] himself as the son of
[1:16:16] David and the son of Abraham.
[1:16:19] So I asked a
[1:16:21] question. There must be a connection
[1:16:25] between something
[1:16:28] Abraham between
[1:16:31] something. You don't hear me
[1:16:34] say amen.
[1:16:37] Now we know
[1:16:39] that Abraham Abraham was the father of
[1:16:43] faith. We know that when God
[1:16:48] started to build his people,
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:56] Isaac,
[1:16:58] Jacob, Joseph, the whole line of Israel
[1:17:03] parted with Abraham.
[1:17:06] God told Abraham
[1:17:08] that thy
[1:17:09] seed shall
[1:17:12] possess shall possess
[1:17:15] the gates of the enemy.
[1:17:17] But more than
[1:17:19] that, he told Abraham,
[1:17:22] look to the left, look to the right,
[1:17:25] look behind him, look in front of you.
[1:17:29] Everything you see.
[1:17:32] Everything you see
[1:17:34] belongs to
[1:17:38] you. Can the church say amen?
[1:17:42] So
[1:17:44] Abraham
[1:17:46] Abraham was the
[1:17:49] foundation. Are you with me?
[1:17:52] God spoke to Abraham
[1:17:55] when he was 75 years old.
[1:17:58] God gave him a
[1:18:00] promise of a son. But he gave him a
[1:18:03] promise,
[1:18:05] a
[1:18:08] [Music]
[1:18:18] landmark
[1:18:19] land. They are giants in the
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:28] land. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:18:32] That's why we say
[1:18:36] tonight, every
[1:18:38] child, every
[1:18:40] child must
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:57] fall. Let's go. Continue. Abraham
[1:19:01] Abraham is 75 years old.
[1:19:05] God tells
[1:19:06] him, "All the
[1:19:09] land is your land." When Lot left
[1:19:13] him and told Lot, choose where you want
[1:19:16] to
[1:19:17] go. And when Lot walked
[1:19:20] away, Abraham,
[1:19:23] look around you.
[1:19:25] All is yours.
[1:19:27] Listen carefully.
[1:19:30] Abraham Abraham didn't have an army.
[1:19:39] Could it be?
[1:19:41] I'm looking at Abraham's army.
[1:19:44] When Abraham
[1:19:46] received the promise,
[1:19:49] he did not have the people
[1:19:52] to fulfill the promise.
[1:19:55] You don't hear me tonight.
[1:19:58] Abraham Abraham had the promise.
[1:20:01] He didn't even have a
[1:20:04] child land.
[1:20:07] You don't hear me
[1:20:09] this say amen. Amen.
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:26] I'm dropping some seeds in here.
[1:20:31] Remember
[1:20:33] my title, the mystery mystery of Caleb
[1:20:38] between Abraham and David, it's
[1:20:43] important.
[1:20:45] So Abraham Abraham, he is getting older.
[1:20:50] He is getting older.
[1:20:52] and he
[1:20:53] knows that there's a land that belongs
[1:20:56] to
[1:20:57] him. But read the Bible.
[1:21:00] There is no scripture
[1:21:03] that shows that Abraham
[1:21:05] possessed the land.
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:14] God gave him the land.
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:18] But Abraham Abraham never got to possess
[1:21:21] it.
[1:21:23] In Genesis 23,
[1:21:28] the Bible tells me
[1:21:30] that Sarah
[1:21:33] died.
[1:21:35] She was 127 years old.
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:40] Abraham Abraham was 137 years old.
[1:21:46] He knows
[1:21:49] about the promised
[1:21:53] landmine is going to possess
[1:22:01] it. There's something in here.
[1:22:05] So when Sarah
[1:22:08] dies, the Bible says that Abraham
[1:22:12] Abraham went to the Hittites.
[1:22:18] And he said, "I want to buy.
[1:22:22] I want to
[1:22:24] purchase piece of
[1:22:26] land so I could bury my
[1:22:30] wife." Now, I want you to
[1:22:32] notice this is land in Canaan.
[1:22:37] God already gave him this
[1:22:40] land, but he doesn't have the
[1:22:43] army to possess the land yet.
[1:22:49] But Abraham
[1:22:51] knows the resurrection,
[1:22:54] the promise, the power is in the land.
[1:23:02] So Abraham Abraham goes to the Hittites
[1:23:06] and say, "Sell
[1:23:09] me a piece of land."
[1:23:12] They say to Abraham,
[1:23:15] Abraham, whatever land you want to get,
[1:23:20] bury your family,
[1:23:23] we will sell it to
[1:23:29] you. Abraham says, "There's a piece of
[1:23:33] land that I like.
[1:23:38] I like I see a piece of land that I
[1:23:40] like.
[1:23:43] That piece of
[1:23:44] land looks a certain
[1:23:49] way and in that land it has a piece that
[1:23:53] looks like a mountain.
[1:23:56] That
[1:23:57] land has a cave.
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:03] And the Bible says that Abraham Abraham
[1:24:06] paid 400
[1:24:10] 400 pieces of
[1:24:13] silver to buy Hebron.
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:17] [Applause]
[1:24:25] So Abraham, Abraham, God gave him the
[1:24:28] land.
[1:24:30] In order to bury Sarah,
[1:24:33] he for the land,
[1:24:37] land called Abram.
[1:24:40] So he could bury her.
[1:24:42] The Bible says, Abraham, Abraham was
[1:24:46] buried in Hebron.
[1:24:48] Sarah was buried in Hebrew.
[1:24:52] All the
[1:24:53] patriots were buried in Hebrew.
[1:24:56] Now listen, it's one thing
[1:25:00] for somebody to give you
[1:25:05] land. It's a whole different
[1:25:08] story. When you pay for land,
[1:25:13] this particular piece of ground
[1:25:18] called Hebron
[1:25:20] was given to Abraham
[1:25:23] and Abraham paid for.
[1:25:28] So there were two
[1:25:30] reasons to
[1:25:31] fight for this particular ground.
[1:25:36] It was given to
[1:25:38] him and he paid for it.
[1:25:41] No
[1:25:43] wonder Caleb said
[1:25:47] Give me this
[1:25:52] mountain. You don't hear me
[1:25:55] tonight. You don't hear me
[1:25:58] tonight. A lot of
[1:26:01] land that's part of the promised
[1:26:07] landing this mountain.
[1:26:11] I
[1:26:12] know that God gave me the land.
[1:26:16] But Abraham,
[1:26:18] he paid for this people.
[1:26:20] This is the thing I want.
[1:26:24] Abraham is buried here.
[1:26:27] Sarah is buried here.
[1:26:30] Now
[1:26:31] therefore, give me this
[1:26:39] mountain.
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:27:03] Listen, when Abraham Lord Abraham paid
[1:27:06] for the
[1:27:08] land, there were No giants there.
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:16] [Applause]
[1:27:22] It would have been very difficult
[1:27:25] to do a funeral service
[1:27:29] for Sister Sarah
[1:27:32] if there were giants there.
[1:27:39] But over the passage of time,
[1:27:44] God told Abraham,
[1:27:47] "Your people,
[1:27:49] your
[1:27:50] seed will sjourn in a strange land.
[1:27:54] And for 400
[1:27:56] years, they were in bondage in Egypt.
[1:28:01] While they were in
[1:28:03] bondage,
[1:28:05] giants inhabited the
[1:28:07] land. You don't hear me. You don't hear
[1:28:11] me. While they were in bondage,
[1:28:15] giants inhabited the
[1:28:19] land. And when man fell in Genesis,
[1:28:23] man have been in bondage,
[1:28:26] and giants
[1:28:29] had infested the land.
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:36] I've got good news.
[1:28:39] Bondage is temporary.
[1:28:43] Bondage is temporary.
[1:28:48] When God
[1:28:50] was ready,
[1:28:52] he said, "I have heard
[1:28:54] the cries of my people
[1:28:57] in
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:28:59] Ira and I have come down.
[1:29:03] I have come down.
[1:29:05] I have come down.
[1:29:09] [Applause]
[1:29:18] I have forgotten to look at my notes.
[1:29:24] I'm still on page one.
[1:29:27] You are helping me to
[1:29:30] preach. Listen.
[1:29:34] When Moses
[1:29:36] left Egypt,
[1:29:39] I want you to
[1:29:41] understand in the book of Deuteronomy,
[1:29:45] chapter 3,
[1:29:47] the Bible tells us, the first major
[1:29:50] battle,
[1:29:53] Moses had to deal with
[1:29:57] was a
[1:29:58] king named King Og.
[1:30:02] The Bible said,
[1:30:04] He was the
[1:30:05] last of a line of giants.
[1:30:10] So the first giant killer
[1:30:14] in the Bible was Moses.
[1:30:18] Moses,
[1:30:19] God told Moses.
[1:30:22] Do not fear him.
[1:30:24] Do not fear that giant.
[1:30:27] You will take that giant.
[1:30:30] Can the church say amen? Amen. I want to
[1:30:33] encourage you
[1:30:36] church in that battle.
[1:30:39] There would have been a young brother
[1:30:42] in the front of the
[1:30:45] convention. That young brother
[1:30:48] saw. When Moses
[1:30:51] killed that
[1:30:53] giant, that young brother kept it in his
[1:30:56] heart.
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:07] This young brother
[1:31:09] was special.
[1:31:12] Because this young brother
[1:31:14] was not a
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:21] Jewish Bible says that he was a
[1:31:24] Kennesite.
[1:31:26] It meant he was from the land of Canaan.
[1:31:31] something in his
[1:31:33] heart attracted him to the convention in
[1:31:37] Ivory
[1:31:43] Coast. Anybody with me?
[1:31:47] There are 12 tribes
[1:31:50] in Israel.
[1:31:51] I don't know how
[1:31:54] this Kennesite
[1:31:56] gets to join the tribe of Judah.
[1:32:00] But this genocide
[1:32:02] came to be
[1:32:04] known as Caleb
[1:32:07] of the tribe of Judah.
[1:32:09] Now listen,
[1:32:11] Moses is anointed.
[1:32:14] Moses is
[1:32:16] inspired. He said, "I want 12 ministers
[1:32:21] [Applause]
[1:32:22] to go investigate the land.
[1:32:27] Find me your 12 bless men.
[1:32:32] The tribe of Simeon.
[1:32:35] They got a brother who was on
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:40] fire. They got the from the tribe of
[1:32:43] God. They got a brother on fire.
[1:32:47] From the tribe of
[1:32:49] Reuben, brother on fire. from the tribe
[1:32:52] of Napali
[1:32:54] tribe of Zebulun.
[1:32:57] All these brothers,
[1:32:59] faithful brothers,
[1:33:01] they born in
[1:33:03] church. They grow up in church.
[1:33:06] When they call the tribe of Judah,
[1:33:10] there's this brother coming
[1:33:11] up. He doesn't look like a Jew.
[1:33:15] He doesn't walk like a Jew.
[1:33:18] He's a gentile.
[1:33:20] team. He's a gentile. In addition to
[1:33:23] He's a gentile.
[1:33:27] [Applause]
[1:33:45] So
[1:33:46] friends, 12 brothers.
[1:33:50] 12 tribes,
[1:33:52] 11 Jews,
[1:33:54] one Gentile,
[1:33:56] Joshua and Caleb.
[1:33:59] They pull to the side
[1:34:02] because they moving different.
[1:34:04] Their faith is different.
[1:34:07] Their expectation is
[1:34:09] different. Their understanding is
[1:34:12] different. Their revelation is
[1:34:15] different. Their is different.
[1:34:20] is
[1:34:21] different. Hope is
[1:34:25] different. Is different.
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:45] church.
[1:34:47] 12 brothers
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:50] have all the quotes,
[1:34:53] all the
[1:34:54] books, all
[1:34:57] the know what God
[1:35:00] did. They knew he took them from Egypt.
[1:35:04] They knew he took them through.
[1:35:08] But when they got to the
[1:35:10] land, Joshua and Caleb,
[1:35:13] they were eating grapes,
[1:35:17] drinking milk,
[1:35:19] had a spoon of
[1:35:22] honey. Some giants passed
[1:35:26] by. Caleb kept
[1:35:29] eating. He kept eating.
[1:35:33] He kept eating.
[1:35:35] He kept
[1:35:37] eating. He didn't
[1:35:39] move. He wasn't
[1:35:41] scared. He knew that the bride had a
[1:35:47] revival. He knew seven
[1:35:52] thunders. He knew
[1:35:57] seven. He knew that the book was
[1:36:01] open. Hallelujah.
[1:36:07] Every giant
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:22] [Applause]
[1:36:25] church,
[1:36:27] brother Brandham taught us
[1:36:30] to be true ministers.
[1:36:34] will misunderstand this prophet.
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:45] But Joshua and Caleb,
[1:36:51] listen, the other 10
[1:36:54] brothers, I am not
[1:36:57] sure if they ate one grape.
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:07] The other
[1:37:08] brothers when they saw
[1:37:11] that the promise of the Holy
[1:37:14] Ghost just as real,
[1:37:17] they scratched their
[1:37:18] head giant of
[1:37:28] unbelief.
[1:37:31] Those 10 brothers
[1:37:34] ran back to Moses
[1:37:40] and they gave a
[1:37:43] report
[1:37:47] and I want you to
[1:37:50] picture the
[1:37:53] people and and Joshua and Caleb,
[1:37:57] they are running back to camp.
[1:38:01] They are running back to
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:04] Captain Caleb's shirt.
[1:38:08] When he went to the
[1:38:10] land, it was a white shirt.
[1:38:13] When he came back, it was a purple
[1:38:16] shirt,
[1:38:18] grape
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:22] juice,
[1:38:24] milk, food.
[1:38:26] He said we are going
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:28] to let us go up at
[1:38:31] once. Let us go at
[1:38:34] once. Let us go
[1:38:36] tonight. Let's go now.
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:15] Church,
[1:39:17] we know the story.
[1:39:20] The Bible
[1:39:21] said that the children of Israel
[1:39:25] tried to stone Joshua and Caleb.
[1:39:32] Could you
[1:39:33] imagine the thing we fought for all
[1:39:35] these years?
[1:39:38] All of these
[1:39:40] conventions, all of these
[1:39:42] meetings, all of this
[1:39:44] sacrifice, and you want to tell me I
[1:39:47] have to go
[1:39:48] home the way that I
[1:39:50] came, you got to be kidding
[1:39:53] me. You have to be kidding me. After all
[1:39:56] these
[1:39:57] years, I'm going to miss the
[1:40:01] rapture. You have to be kidding me. We
[1:40:04] are more than able. We are more than
[1:40:06] able.
[1:40:08] Sickness is defeated.
[1:40:11] Unbelief is defeated.
[1:40:14] Tonight,
[1:40:16] every giant
[1:40:18] must fall.
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:48] Church, the scripture we
[1:40:51] read for
[1:40:53] years, Caleb had to walk in the
[1:40:57] wilderness
[1:40:59] because of unbelief.
[1:41:01] They did not take the
[1:41:03] land. But you know what I love about
[1:41:05] Caleb?
[1:41:07] The scripture we
[1:41:10] read. He said, "My brethren
[1:41:14] who did not
[1:41:16] believe." Listen, he didn't even speak
[1:41:19] bad about
[1:41:21] them. He still called them brethren.
[1:41:25] Said, "My brethren,
[1:41:28] made the people's heart to melt.
[1:41:32] But here I
[1:41:34] stand
[1:41:36] 2025. I'm 85 years old.
[1:41:40] I was 40 years old.
[1:41:44] When we started this
[1:41:46] journey and in this
[1:41:49] year I'm just as strong.
[1:41:52] The message is just as strong. The
[1:41:57] anointing is just as strong.
[1:42:03] Foxy Fox.
[1:42:07] [Applause]
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:19] Moses Moes killed one giant.
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:24] I don't know
[1:42:27] if Moses had advanced warning
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:33] that a giant was the next
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:39] challenge because along's life's
[1:42:44] journey you meet
[1:42:48] challenges that you have not prepared
[1:42:50] for.
[1:42:53] that you never had to deal
[1:42:55] with. Kill him. He saw these giants
[1:43:00] before
[1:43:03] over 40 years ago.
[1:43:06] These were the same
[1:43:08] giants. There were no different
[1:43:12] giants, the same
[1:43:14] ones that he saw before
[1:43:18] that was still
[1:43:19] there. He said, "I am ready to go up."
[1:43:24] He said, "If God is with
[1:43:27] me, I don't even need
[1:43:29] help. If God is with me,
[1:43:33] I don't need my
[1:43:35] brothers. If God is with
[1:43:38] me, I am more than able.
[1:43:42] And tonight,
[1:43:44] if the Lord is with us,
[1:43:47] we are more than
[1:43:49] able to start a revival
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:54] that will change the
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:00] world church.
[1:44:02] This is not the Ivory Coast Convention.
[1:44:09] Not the earth.
[1:44:12] You don't hear me
[1:44:14] tonight. You don't hear me
[1:44:16] tonight.
[1:44:18] Tonight we shall
[1:44:21] notice every
[1:44:23] giant every
[1:44:25] country this
[1:44:27] earth belongs to
[1:44:29] us.
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] Church, we have an eternal
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:51] visa. No
[1:44:53] country can stop this.
[1:44:59] government. No
[1:45:03] politics, no
[1:45:11] minister,
[1:45:14] every child.
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:43] Hallelujah.

[1:46:25] Hosana.
[1:46:27] Hosana.
[1:46:29] Hosana. Hosana.
[1:46:36] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:46:38] Yes.
[1:46:51] Yes.
[1:46:53] Glory.
[1:46:55] Hallelujah. Satan is in trouble.
[1:46:58] The devil is in trouble.
[1:47:01] Church.
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:09] These giants
[1:47:12] had names
[1:47:14] and names
[1:47:16] have meanings.
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:23] Tonight we are not guessing.
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:29] We are not hoping to hit.
[1:47:33] These giants
[1:47:35] the Bible has a finite number,
[1:47:39] a specific number.
[1:47:44] So we know the giant called Goliath.
[1:47:48] We know what happened to him.
[1:47:50] He had to fall.
[1:47:53] You know the
[1:47:54] Bible says that Goliath had a brother.
[1:48:00] [Applause]
[1:48:01] Church when David
[1:48:05] killed Goliath,
[1:48:07] it made giant killing
[1:48:14] normal. You don't hear me
[1:48:16] [Applause]
[1:48:18] tonight. You don't hear me tonight.
[1:48:24] [Applause]
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:29] in second
[1:48:31] Samuel 21
[1:48:34] in verse 15.
[1:48:37] I'll just paraphrase.
[1:48:40] The Philistines at war again with
[1:48:41] Israel.
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:44] And David went
[1:48:46] down and fought the
[1:48:49] Philistines. And the Bible said that
[1:48:52] David waxed
[1:48:54] feet. David was
[1:48:56] tired. I want you to picture right
[1:49:00] now of that day.
[1:49:03] David was the only minister
[1:49:06] that had ever killed a giant.
[1:49:09] When when David got saved,
[1:49:12] the Bible says that
[1:49:16] is another giant.
[1:49:21] [Applause]
[1:49:25] He thought he got a good idea.
[1:49:29] He tried to kill David.
[1:49:32] And on his way to kill David,
[1:49:36] another brother
[1:49:39] named Abishai
[1:49:42] without his sword
[1:49:44] and he felt inspired.
[1:49:47] Nobody told him to do it.
[1:49:50] He said, "Look, a giant
[1:49:53] and the Bible said, he killed that
[1:49:57] giant. David
[1:49:59] is resting."
[1:50:01] One of David's men,
[1:50:04] he took out the
[1:50:05] giant. If David could have spoken to us
[1:50:09] tonight,
[1:50:11] he would send us a message.
[1:50:14] Every giant
[1:50:17] must
[1:50:23] fall.
[1:50:26] Listen, it doesn't it doesn't stop
[1:50:30] there.
[1:50:31] That same
[1:50:32] scripture and it came to pass
[1:50:36] There was another
[1:50:39] battle
[1:50:41] and another brother killed S. He was
[1:50:47] another giant.
[1:50:49] These were the
[1:50:51] cousins of of Goliath.
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:50:58] Goliath was
[1:51:00] dead and all of his
[1:51:02] cousins were still trying to exist.
[1:51:07] David's mighty men,
[1:51:10] David's gentile warriors,
[1:51:14] they were not
[1:51:16] prepared to let one giant live.
[1:51:22] If it looked like a giant,
[1:51:25] if it walked like a giant,
[1:51:28] If it moved like a giant.
[1:51:32] If the bed was too big,
[1:51:35] if the house was too tall,
[1:51:38] you don't hear me.
[1:51:40] Can the church say amen?
[1:51:42] They had a
[1:51:44] revelation that every
[1:51:47] giant had to fall.
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:54] [Applause]
[1:51:58] Hallelujah. Let me try to bring this
[1:52:00] home.
[1:52:05] The mystery mystery of Caleb
[1:52:10] between Abraham Abraham and David.
[1:52:15] Abraham Abraham bought the land of
[1:52:18] Hebron.
[1:52:21] King
[1:52:22] David would be crowned as king
[1:52:27] on Hebron. If Caleb did not
[1:52:33] expel the sons of Anoch
[1:52:36] from
[1:52:37] Hebron this
[1:52:39] story would not
[1:52:41] connect. Abraham bought
[1:52:44] it. Caleb
[1:52:47] leanth and David was
[1:52:51] crowned at the
[1:52:55] earth.
[1:52:56] Church, there is no crowning
[1:53:00] unless you deal with your
[1:53:12] child. I'm trying to find a place to
[1:53:14] close
[1:53:18] out. Brother Brandham said when Satan
[1:53:23] was in heaven,
[1:53:25] Satan knew
[1:53:28] some of the plans of God
[1:53:31] and Satan
[1:53:33] tried to interrupt God's program.
[1:53:37] God was always planning
[1:53:42] to make David
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:45] king. Saul was never part of the
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:52] plan was the devil's
[1:53:56] attempt to give the people a
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:00] substitute. But in God's mind,
[1:54:04] the scripture in Matthew 1:1
[1:54:08] was already written,
[1:54:11] son of Abraham, Abraham, son of David,
[1:54:16] and in there a mystery of a gentile,
[1:54:23] a type of
[1:54:24] us. If there was no gentile
[1:54:27] there, he would have never been part of
[1:54:30] the story.
[1:54:36] He was a gentile
[1:54:38] adopted adopted into Judah
[1:54:42] the royal tribe.
[1:54:45] You don't hear me this.
[1:54:48] [Applause]
[1:55:00] And then one day, this is what Easter
[1:55:03] proves,
[1:55:05] and I'm getting ready to close out.
[1:55:09] One
[1:55:10] day, the son of Abraham,
[1:55:14] the son of David,
[1:55:16] the great high priest,
[1:55:19] who was also a
[1:55:21] king. Never
[1:55:23] before was there
[1:55:25] somebody who had so many
[1:55:28] titles in the Old
[1:55:30] Testament. To be a king, you had to be
[1:55:34] in the tribe of
[1:55:35] Judah. To be a priest, you had to be in
[1:55:39] the tribe of
[1:55:40] Levi. But here came
[1:55:42] someone who could trace his
[1:55:47] genealogy. After Abraham,
[1:55:49] he could trace his genealogy.
[1:55:53] to
[1:55:54] David and his order was
[1:55:57] higher than the order of Aaron
[1:56:01] because he was of the order
[1:56:03] of Melazc.
[1:56:06] He was a priest. He was a king. He was a
[1:56:10] judge. He
[1:56:12] was a healer.
[1:56:15] He was a way maker.
[1:56:17] He was a miracle worker.
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:24] Listen church, I'm getting ready to
[1:56:27] close.
[1:56:29] By the
[1:56:29] time Jesus
[1:56:32] came, there were no more
[1:56:36] giants on the
[1:56:39] earth, could
[1:56:41] kill with a
[1:56:43] sword. But there were three
[1:56:46] giants that David couldn't deal with.
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] Caleb couldn't do
[1:56:53] it. David's men couldn't do
[1:56:56] it. There was a giant called
[1:57:00] death. There was a giant called hell.
[1:57:05] There was a giant called the
[1:57:08] grave. And when Jesus
[1:57:10] came, he said, "Don't
[1:57:13] worry. I got this.
[1:57:17] I got this.
[1:57:20] I got this.
[1:57:27] Listen.
[1:57:28] Caleb expelled the three sons of Anoch.
[1:57:35] Jesus came and expelled death,
[1:57:40] hell and the grave. Jesus
[1:57:45] walked into hell
[1:57:47] on Saturday
[1:57:50] between Friday
[1:57:52] and Sunday. They were having a
[1:57:54] celebration.
[1:57:56] They thought he was
[1:57:58] dead. For Jesus, the great giant
[1:58:04] slayer knew that every giant
[1:58:09] must fall.
[1:58:12] Sickness must fall.
[1:58:16] Cancer must
[1:58:18] fall.
[1:58:20] Death must
[1:58:21] fall. The
[1:58:23] grain must fall.
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:32] Jesus must open the
[1:58:35] door, walk straight up to the devil.
[1:58:39] The security couldn't stop him.
[1:58:43] Those demons couldn't stop
[1:58:45] him. He took the keys,
[1:58:49] and he lifted up the
[1:58:52] keys. The mighty conqueror,
[1:58:55] the mighty conqueror.
[1:58:58] Every giant
[1:59:00] is already dead.
[1:59:02] No more giants.
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:13] Finish. You are free.
[1:59:16] You are
[1:59:17] free. You are free. And who the son of
[1:59:20] man says
[1:59:22] free is free indeed.
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:27] May the Lord bless you.
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:48] [Music]
