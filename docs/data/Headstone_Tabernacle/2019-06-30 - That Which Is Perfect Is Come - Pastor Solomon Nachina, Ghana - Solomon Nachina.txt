spoke to me he said back in the fields and there was no invites there was nobody inviting see anything like that and of course whatever God say become the past he doesn't say anything not big enough to bring the pass he's big enough to bring the past you have to figure it out you just have to believe what he said regardless of the circumstance recurse at the condition so I know if there is no invites nobody invited me to have none do what God said if God said he don't know he already know who to fix that up already oughta bring that then I got an email from this guy what a Solomon Aegina invited me to Ghana of december of twenty of 2012 and I didn't know him and he just had it in his heart that when he comes back he was in London it was England and he said any time you go back to

morning that Trinidad is just like back home and when we come here we feel a connection hallelujah much more when we come in the presence of the Lord we feel we've been somewhere before where once back in Elohim and we are just here to express that manifestation that we came from God and we are going back to God so we are certainly happy to be here with my wife I believe we are enjoying ourselves in the mirror oh man and the wonderful brethren up there I was telling I was telling sister Raymond I'm waiting for the bread in from Africa to come and I'll find out how you know they've been to Trinidad they just sneaked into Port of Spain and sneaked out and they say we are in Trinidad but we have been to train it out hallelujah amen so we are enjoying ourselves and we thank you for the great hospitality my precious brother Ramon and family we certainly appreciate the great hospitality we are treated like Royals you know I feel at home feel like a son of a king and yesterday we were with the Williams but William and his family we certainly appreciate them we have some some good Caribbean food and I was really feeling amen and this morning our precious where the Maven drove us to church and we certainly appreciate you all for your kindness and great hospitality and like but Ovid said you know we connected we better move it as young men were away about I was about 26 when he came to Ghana with the Brethren from Lagos they passed by to Ghana and they had meetings in Ghana and when Berto we'd finished preaching there was a group of us about four friends and I said this man has brought a revolution to the message and they were like why I'm like look we go to services we have three four hours of same one but this man comes in 45 minutes is out of the way aha man that is that was a revolution amen and so we connected with him something about him not just you know the time but he came with the world in purity in simplicity and empower brother is shook our hearts and we are terrified with him amen and so growing up when we didn't see him on the field was a revolution going on behind the scenes we said no this man must come back on the scene because they caught cold man and when God makes a way he's gonna come back brother and got shot he'd make away and he's back on the field and everybody was better of it everywhere and we are ten defied with him he's a man that stays with the word he has no funny business he comes in straight to the world you get on the phone with Peruvian you would not even say what you want to say he's gone he's a matter of few words you know but praise Allah will love him you loved his wife his family his church hallelujah we love all of you we are identified with Trinidad and with a headstone tabernacle and so I bring greetings from whom as well on our way we pass through West Palm Beach and by the way school and the church send their greetings to you they surpass our British over to the Brethren and better ovid and I was telling better early this morning you know we have families in Ghana da hook up to your services I mean they at home and for the purity of the way that is flowing through here they stick every savage to you we were hooked up on Wednesday when brother O'Brien was preaching so we don't miss a service we are always with you in the spirit and we shall identify with you this morning so I trust that the Lord will bless us this morning as we stand to our feet and let's get straight to the word as battle over it we say straight to the word man shall we turn to the book of first Corinthians chapter 13 I trust the Lord will bless us this morning first Corinthians 13 you know the story but we'll read from this eight charity never faileth but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come now this is prophecy when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity and then we tend to the last one March each of the eleven was two to five main now when John had heard in the prison the wakes of Christ he sent two disciples of his and said unto Him art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answered and said unto them go should I go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk and the lepers are cleansed and the Deaf hear and the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them hallelujah Chargers bar has us we pray our Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for your grace thank you Lord for your saving grace that has made a way for us to be your presence and you promised that way two or three I got it in your name you are in their midst we know without a doubt that you are here this morning father we thank you for the word and we thank you for the ring of the word father I hide myself behind the cross this morning may you come in this morning and take over speak to your people Lord bless the ring of your word a preaching of the word and the hearing of it father and the end will be careful to give the praise and glory in Jesus name Amen and amen amen you may be seated so this morning I have a title amen and my title is that which is perfect is come amen now Paul was given a prophecy but we are here in the manifestation and we are declaring that that prophecy is here that that which is perfect is not coming is here it has come amen and my subject is only belief now there's a difference between believing and only believing so I want us to only believe this morning and it's not some mysterious thing but God in simplicity and that's my inspiration this morning so I trust that the Lord will bless us this morning you love him man and I'll trust that we will have a fellowship this morning and as we preach I need you to pick back to me hallelujah the gospel Abraha Oxford a poster of one time what is fellowship he said two fellows in the ship so he's the preacher and you in the ship this morning having fellowship you believe that this morning Amen so I know you've been feeding on the word Amen and I know we are growing higher and higher into the image of his son Amen and all that the word is to do is to bring us to that perfection to bring us to only the word to bring us to a place of only believing a place that we will not doubt the word that whatever is written in that where it is this say of the Lord whatever is written in that where is ye and amen whatever is written in that word is for me whatever promise is declared in that word is mine hallelujah I'm not waiting for somebody to testify about what our is to him that where is my deliverance is my healing is mine the Holy Ghost is my is my promise and we are here by the promise of the world hallelujah and Paul said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature that divine nature is the perfection of who he is the prophets were pointing us to this day they were pointing us to that perfect word they were pointing us to who Christ was his nature he's been hallelujah and what is that nature what is that being is to be manifested in the bride that bride is here to manifest not perfection or the professions or books and tapes that perfection is a living reality where Moses metal reality he said let me turn outside and look at this side brother it was something that was not comprehensive to the human mind a bush was burning but was not been it was not consumed it was unusual that was a manifestation of this living reality Moses how to turn aside hallelujah but today we know that that living reality is but as the word but we have to turn our site and look at that word what is in that word for me what is in that word for me that is where we are here today and that word is in the bride brother and the devil cannot come near that word because that word his power is power and as many of us believe him as many as received him to them he gave them power power to overcome power to be the sons of God power to be the daughters of God you say oh but not me yes you because God knew you're healed God brought on you God trusted you God knew you could not come in any other age they brought you to this age he knew that you could be the word you could be the word Express today so God reserved you for last hallelujah hallelujah when you read the Bible a man you may be seen it when you read that word you say Oh Daniel was a man of faith but God brought more of your faith than what Daniel had so go to Daniel go your way I'm just gonna show you a vision of this bride that is coming in the last day that would be the final voice Daniel saw you and wanted to be in your day but God said no come on Daniel they have more faith than you have in this day they are coming in that final age they are coming in that final time to manifest me to express this God and those that loggia brought in that day we date this day you shall do great exploits [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah that demons in Daniels they were not as powerful as this day hallelujah so Daniel couldn't stand the demon powers of this day so go say but I've gotta people I've got a bride that was to take that word that would believe that word that will hold on to that word no man can let them do otherwise because they came from God and they are going back to God but once they are on the air they will express that word it was stand for that word do believe that word nothing will shake them from that word so go to Daniel go away Daniel I've got a super Church I've got a super bright I've got a people that can only believe I've other people don't know be tied to denomination don't know be try to create don't know bit try to science oneness of man my brother they are waiting for that charity that cannot fail that charity that was all that God is wrapped up in a and that charity is to be expressed in you hallelujah is a when that which is perfect is come hallelujah Luther couldn't produce this day Wesley couldn't produce this day the Pentecostals could not produce this day but product there's a pride the prophetess a bride who you believe that this morning Alleluia amen you may be seated Alleluia da which is perfect is come well Brahm said in the city of discrepancy now he said the seed of God the Word of God the seed of God is the word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of his kind now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the word of God hallelujah give me Bible no I'm looking at Bible this morning because that word is in you that where is in me then we must be the seed and we must be the word hallelujah and when it our weight come from that word came from God that word was God that word became flesh and dwelt among us and John had the privilege to introduce that word hallelujah he said behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world amen John was only believing but a time came doubt came into John's heart is it aware or we are to expect another is it that inspiration or we are to expect a greater inspiration hallelujah by the word spoke back to John go tell John that it was prophesied hallelujah that I'm gonna come on the air I'm gonna heal the sick I'm gonna raise the dead I'm gonna open the blind eye I'm gonna preach to the people that are bound in prison I'm gonna set the captives free well go back and tell John that this is taking place that means that that which was prophesied is right here and it's manifesting itself Oh glory be to the Living God now that don't need no interpretation so go back tell John that you see the signs you see the Sigmund Hill then you know that that profession is here it's not coming here it's not speaking in tongues brother you've got to get charity then all that will follow hallelujah the prophecies will follow charity the signs and wonders will follow charity not tarry to following the signs and wonders so we are looking for that perfection where it is only the word and only the word alone oh you believe that this morning and now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God and the Word of God manifested in the eight that we are living in for the promised seed of that age amen now let me take that again he the chin of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they are living in for the promised seed of that age God gave his when at the beginning and each a has each see its time and its promises hallelujah so we have our time we have our word we have our seed and we have our promises hallelujah we couldn't perfection to luta we couldn't print perfection to Wesley we couldn't perfection to the Pentecostals but brother this is our time hallelujah this is our time jesus said be therefore now what hallelujah even as your heavenly Father is hallelujah so we are seeds of perfection don't wonder you have a Ministry of perfection ha it's not a statement is our sea is our life is our manifestation is our promise Oh blessed be the name of a living God and when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with your body might be aching you but don't worry does impart we receive a promise hallelujah hallelujah I was reading this week umbrella braham's said when you get cancer is it now cancer is a demon amen every sickness is a demon but the Prophet gave them the mystery of how these demons come into that place but ROM said when his cell is bucks leading in your body itself get bus leading in your body then the devil now finds a way to get to the bus leading cell and gives it life of cancer and begins to grow in that bus leading cell hallelujah that demon gets into the box leaving cell but the prophecy but the Bible said in my name deja Castle what Devils hallelujah so we have a right this morning to speak to every bucks leading sell everybody's leading kidney everybody slit in pancreas everybody's living blood wherever right this morning because that which is perfect is here the Word of God is here to speak to your condition that every bucks leading conditioning your body must be restored must be restored and when is restored that devil has no right be diabetes it has no right to stay there because that cell will be spoken to and in the name of Jesus Christ that demon has to leave that demon has to leave because the word comes into the perfection of your body Oh glory be to the Living God this body hallelujah hallelujah now that is our word that is our seed that is our promise and we are to pick up that word pick up the promise and put it before the devil let the devil see you I'm a son of God I have come to only believe that all things are possible all things are possible I might fall today but I have a promise I have a promise that I'm gonna rise the game in the name of Jesus Christ and the devil cannot hold your pass against you don't care what you did yesterday God wash you white house No hallelujah and this morning your victory you have victory picked you over your mind because your mind does not even come into the picture hallelujah we don't believe with our mind we believe with our heart so the devil will attack the mind by he cannot come into the heart in that heart is a place of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is telling you today that you have power because you have overcome the wicked one that devil does not stop you the circumstance of life lesson estoppel you have already overcome here because greater is He that is in you what is in you that perfection the word charity and charity can never we'll never has never failed my god has never lost a battle he's never lost a battle against

battle he will never lose the butter one time he wasn't a ship we seated near a cedar this morning one time he was resting in the back of a ship and the storms were raging hallelujah and I you know Jesus had a sound asleep ever when the storm and the boat was rocking Jesus was snoring away and the disciples did all they could do in their own ability brother they couldn't calm the storm they went back to the back of the boat and diesel was sound they said master you don't care if we perish hallelujah Jesus liked what was happening say man when he got out there brother that was the storm Oh glory but you know what G's at the respect to the storm he said peace be still hallelujah so the peace was troubled but Jesus spoke to it he said peace be still and went back and had a sleep that was the master of the wind hallelujah he could speak to the wind and the wind could pay him hallelujah how much more his children this morning that he brought forth an expression of his thought brought you thought here to be a representation of himself on the earth how much more what storm of life what circumstance what situation can stand your way when Jesus is in you Jesus is in your boat today

one that jumped in first God is healing God is deliverance amen and here was this man that had nobody to help him into the water but here was that profession here was Christ himself Halla here was the anointing he came and found him there he said will thou be made whole oh and this man gone through a mood of self-pity I have nobody doesn't know why he's asking you will you be made whole hallelujah

yesterday the same today the same forever oh you may be seated this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you're the reason why we don't only believe Amen the reason why we don't only believe it we do see the manifestation it should be is because we have put God in our own thinking hallelujah we are both scored according to our thinking he might if he's to come he must come this way hallelujah if the Holy Ghost report is got to be this way it's got to see people rolling on the floor hallelujah well he came maybe that way to somebody else but to you it might be a different way you must just

that anything that is complicated is not God hallelujah he is not a complicated God he comes in simplicity that is why today he is not manifested in the big mysteries they claim because any man that

Sun that can take the heat of the rain that can take the storm that will blow the seeds tongues sure hallelujah all the stops are blowing the root is taking deep is going down deep hallelujah standing

finished every mystery finished so no man is coming with a new thing is finished is back to the world back to the Bible part to the promises back to your promises no looters promises not Wesley's promises your promises the promises of God for your life today oh you believe that this morning or in a prophecy in the father the hour has come is that the hour has come where there's a falling away the Bible said except there come a falling away the man of sin won't reveal himself the pentecostal child is living in the falling away time the time has come the time has come for science to follow the believer we are at the end time we are in the latter rain we are we're in there lots of rain Oh glory be to the Living God we are at the time when men will be heady they happily high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God trucebreakers false accusers incontinent and despise those that are good heady highminded the time has come when they are teaching doctrines of devils this number of it now this is the prophecies this is not me now this is the Prophet saying soul and a lot of believers oh I'm tired of this fighting you can be tired of this fighting until we live here because is a war and every soldier is called to battle so you can say you're tired of war no then you're not fit to be a soldier every soldier must fight if I must win I must fight if I must leave I must fight [Applause] so when the pasta is written is not fighting taking care of some demons hallelujah and you need to give him some fire to kick them Devils out because the prophets at that time has come whether with teaching doctrines of devils is it happening I don't know about Trinidad by showing in Ghana the doctors are flying in there but brother we have been given authority to descend them spirits and when you design them three with tandem holiday I take your gun and stand stand your ground hallelujah a lot of the time believers who say I'm tired of this fighting brother but the prophecy attention is part of living if you don't have tension in your life you're like a rug door like some teddy bear sitting on the chair no movement brother we need tension in our life that we can overcome then when you overcome then you become an overcomer then you have something to look back an hour became hour came loss became part of life became popularity overcame the cares of this world I overcame the things of this world the fashions of this world I overcame that larae that time has come we are at the end when men will be heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God trucebreakers false accusers incontinent despise those that are good heady highminded the time has come when they are teaching the doctrines of devils perfect perverting the Bible teaching into theories and theologies to draw groups or people away from after damn his time has come that God will gather his check together soon under one great big banner the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his power among them the great science and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the Pentecostal church take his time and they are taking this time but the time has come for the bride to take his time Alleluia the time has come for the gathering of the people the time has come for Jesus to come that time will soon be here Oh blessed be the name of a lord and the promise that the time has come to circumcise the church and to call out this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old landmark order o landmark of profession the old landmark of holiness the old LACMA of brotherly love the old landmark of love ye one another the time has come for the power of God to be back in the church his time has come his time has come for you to have victory in your life his time has come for you to be Innova , his time has come o blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus cry amen o brother brother brother brother be careful that your crown is instead on someone else's head the time has come we are at the end time if we if we are never going to do anything break if we are ever gonna do anything brethren we are gonna do it now if I must get on fire in church it is now oh they talk about some power coming in just when the power comes and I'll get on fire No now if I must be or if I must be in the front line jumping and shouting it is now because that which is perfect is strapped in Jesus told a woman a time coming when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth and that time is now oh when our brain is now when I'm rejoicing is now when I'm on fire is now what I am believing it is now when I'm holding on to the Word of God it is now the time has come Oh blessed be the name of a living God hallelujah amen Oh glory to glory man oh and the promises amen is this the time is that time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happened what happened could that be so now brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is cut by the seven thunders and we know that the pyramid the cup is charity the cup is the headstone the cup is Christ so seriously think what our are we living in hallelu here is that you remember the pyramid missing is the capstone what did he do the Holy Spirit cupped of the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth and kept add until we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God not complicated simple and when this love is in you this will all men know that you are his disciple o blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah Oh glory to God man Brown says settled friends settle yourselves down the hour has come there's been a lot of plain religion young people there's nothing in this world hallelujah and we don't have to play religion we need an experience with this God because there is a real hell the Bible said so we say behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven so that is coming but we are prepared to escape that day we are in the ark escape in that day so the prophets that let us settle ourselves down the hour has come there's been a lot of plain religion there's been a lot of playing Church but the hour has come where God is calling his people out oh you believe that God is calling these people out that is right and he is vindicating it by science and oneness hallelujah this Holy Ghost we talk about to some is not real because they've never tasted it but it is real it's real that you looking at your hand hallelujah it is real that you're looking at the person next to you the Holy Ghost is just as real today as it was on the day of Pentecost but you need to let yourself away you need to break loose you need to settle down and surrender that is the only way he will come is where you can say Lord I've come to the end of the road I surrender I give up Lord I only believe you Lord for that perfection to come into me just surrender and when you surrender you will see him is

Oh glory to God you've got to believe and as I read this I'm just about closing amen but the branch say who is God now he says if a doctor tells you he's a healer that doctor is a quack hallelujah if a doctor tells you I can heal you but I'll say he's a quack that's all and that's true as a minister I've seen just as many quack - tents as of doctors - anything are you ready now and this is a challenge now is there anything that doesn't believe in ghosts way to me is a quack so if you are sick this morning the word says by His stripes you're gonna be here you have to believe that or else

back again to prove that he didn't die in vain Oh glory be to the Living God hallelujah hallelujah amen and I'm closing out a mail but Abraham said amen Oh glory to God the feet of Abraham bronze I see God always acted in Supernatural because he is supernatural how can people call themselves Christians and do not believe in supernatural so when you walk the world must see the supernatural behind you [Music] [Applause] Peter didn't get into any oxygen tank to receive some supernatural anointing he was just a believer but living on the promise and when the day of Pentecost was fully come he walked into the promise and the Holy Ghost walked with them everywhere they went till the people knew that even his shadow could heal the sick Peter to lay hands no more this is no fairytale brothers this is the word and we must get into that atmosphere for this season this is the season for the power of God to follow the believer not another time this time not with anybody else with you

strength Lord as we approach a convention touch from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet Lord it's a built in his heart to see your people free the convention is not for show it's not just to come together but it's muscley this place this world is not our home we are just passing through may we come to that spiritual realization of what we are born to do we commend everyone into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen you may be seated hallelujah you love the Lord just before I give you announcements so we do want to play a very short deep short clip that we made for the convention before I make our convention announcement so over to you brothers and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the year after that the full corn in the air but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us in the sickle because the harvest has come [Music] therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest at the harvest time the seed is back to its visual condition and must have all all they were in order to be the seed I can't have a half a seat it will grow hmm it's got to be the hold see if Skott do not manifest say I think the Baptist only goes how obvious bigger don't that's just part of not the gifts alive all the gifts see what I mean we're at the in time brother and God has never left east up on the earth without a witness that is always somewhere someplace added the person that he could put his hands on and withstand father wouldn't so he's good that sound since Genesis the beginning surely somewhere God has a man that he laid in now he's more than one man now he has many names that he can lay his hand on because we're coming down through the gathering time the harvest [Music] they've been talking so much about battery not distorting you lettering [Music] what's the matter the church has manufactured herself something just like Eve tried to do she tried to add more lights and manufacture something we've done the same thing time to make something in ourselves keep your hands off is watered and believe it all right in your heart and when the rain begins to fall rise will take home and the word will manifest itself [Music] [Music] a man you appreciate that this morning so I want to salute brother Anthony O'Brien who was the director of that production and but Ovid was the script writer but over time with Anthony woods on that together so we are the green exploitation friends and it's a it's a secret time it's a solemn time and it's a time of joy it's a time that we have been looking for so this week as we prepare for the convention both in the natural and spiritual looking we go to degree things seven services Friday at 10:00 a.m. and then 6:00 p.m. on Friday on Saturday there will be three services so come drink your vitamin C and everything and come on a great expectation there'll be a 10:00 a.m. service 3:00 p.m. service and a 6:00 p.m. service on Saturday and on Sunday Lord willing there will be a 10:00 a.m. service and a 4:00 p.m. service with a prayer line on Sunday so we had a great expectation and so just a few other non spends maintenance group six please meter by the agent Joseph after the service there'll also be a choir practice after the service in addition with respect to your meals we'd like to encourage you to sort out if you'll be requiring a meal and as well as any payment arrangement with the desk downstairs after today for the members of this church I'm not sure if there'll be any one processing those orders so you may have to make alternative arrangement so we really want you to sort that out as well and for those of you who in your heart have made a commitment to the pledge in some way we encourage you to join us in being able to pull all the pieces of the convention together and most important Libyan prayer without prayer without the sacrifice without the efforts when I ran I've said no revival comes with our prayer so we are on the grid expectation come with a burden in your heart and come on the grid expectation and pray for the believers that are on their way that are traveling in we have many challenges every time there are challenges but we have seen God help us overcome every single one every single year so we are looking for course you do something great and be the ministers in prayer as well because we know the ministers kind of bring the revival the revival is born by the people the Bible the revival is carried by the people so you don't have to wait until Friday to get started we get insulted right now every day by the time Friday morning comes this place should be shaking this world should be shaking those in the internet connection should be shaken because the Holy Ghost is already moving as a burden as a crowd as a call and the ministers would barely be able to minister because the Holy Ghost would take complete control you believe that this morning all right so I think that's it for now Spence let's get ready to leave and let's just sing a song I don't know why Jesus loves me I don't know why he cares okay so we're looking for some volunteer so on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. to assist with some chairs and some layouts and stuff for the convention so if you are
