[21:55] from verse one to eat and Revelation
[21:57] chapter 22 we want to read from verse 10
[22:01] to 17 Luke chapter 18 wanna read from
[22:08] verse 1 taste and he speak a parable
[22:10] unto them to this end but men ought
[22:12] always to pray and not to faint
[22:14] and that under and singing there was an
[22:19] a city a judge which he had not God
[22:21] needs a regarded man and there was a
[22:23] widow in that city and she came unto him
[22:26] saying avenge me of mine Visser II and
[22:28] he would not for a while but afterwards
[22:31] he said within himself do I fear not God
[22:34] nor regard man yet because this Widow
[22:38] trouble at me I will avenge her lest by
[22:41] her continual coming she weary me and
[22:45] the Lord said hear what unjust judge see
[22:50] it and shall not God avenge his own
[22:54] elect which cry day and night unto him
[22:56] though he bear long with him I tell you
[23:00] that he will event them speedily
[23:01] nevertheless 1 when the son of man
[23:05] commits shall he find faith on the earth
[23:07] and from revelations up to 22 verse 10
[23:11] he saith unto me seal not the sayings of
[23:15] the prophecy of this book for the time
[23:18] is at hand
[23:19] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[23:20] still he which is filthy let him be
[23:23] filthy still he that is righteous let
[23:25] him be righteous still he that is holy
[23:28] let him be holy still
[23:29] I me who like come quickly my reward is
[23:32] with me to give every man according as
[23:34] his work shall be
[23:35] I'm Alpha Omega the beginning and the
[23:37] end the first and the last
[23:39] blessed the data do his commandments
[23:41] that they may have right to the Tree of
[23:43] Life and may enter in through the gates
[23:45] of the city for with out our dogs and
[23:48] sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers
[23:51] and idolaters and whosoever love it
[23:54] and make it a light i Jesus have sent
[23:56] mine angel to testify unto you these
[23:59] things in the churches
[24:01] I'm the root and the offspring of David
[24:03] and the bright and Morning Star and the
[24:06] spirit and the bride say come
[24:08] at him the heareth say come let him that
[24:11] the tests come and whosoever will let
[24:13] him take the water of life freely may
[24:15] God bless his word you may be seated or
[24:18] praise the Lord amen
[24:20] you got a beer tonight it's good to be
[24:23] here tonight always good and always a
[24:26] blessing and a privilege to come into
[24:28] the house of God
[24:29] oh my last time on for you would see how
[24:34] God has been gracious to us to give us
[24:37] his opportunity all these years to come
[24:40] into his house to hear his word amen so
[24:43] our title tonight
[24:45] seal up the scenes of the prophecy
[24:47] that's the title seal not the sayings of
[24:50] the prophecy for message feet but a
[24:54] Brannon 1953 he was saying listen god
[24:57] bless you I want to tell you one thing I
[24:59] know I'm holding long well just one this
[25:02] wonderful thing I want you to remember
[25:04] there is something fixing to happen now
[25:08] remember I told you that there was a
[25:11] step up coming in the church now these
[25:15] things that you're now seeing are going
[25:17] to be just little things after a while
[25:20] something is moving so he was
[25:23] prophesying of this to pull of the power
[25:26] he was prophesying and I say this listen
[25:29] by the power of the
[25:31] volition of Jesus Christ whom I he said
[25:37] everyone in our doctrine in our baptism
[25:41] we have come to a place but there is
[25:43] some key that will unlock something here
[25:48] so he knew he has the word doctrine
[25:53] teaching presence signs and wonders but
[25:56] is a key to unlock something here no he
[26:00] saw the book sealed on seven seals and
[26:05] when Daniel saw the scene and when the
[26:08] Tundra's utter the voices he said on
[26:10] right that what was that in the
[26:13] scripture but it'll reveal in the last
[26:15] days we are at the time we are chemists
[26:18] right now so he was seeing that these
[26:21] thunders is connected with crossing over
[26:23] to the other side and we know later on
[26:26] he says open up the seals in the back of
[26:28] the book now we could cross over so he
[26:31] knew that the seven thunders was
[26:33] connected to the key to unlock the power
[26:35] so that's why the Prophet says is this
[26:38] the mystery of the thunders that will
[26:40] bring back a power back to the church
[26:41] and you see now the great need for power
[26:44] in the church not torque power not
[26:48] teachings power not big big evangelist
[26:52] we're talking about power the power of
[26:55] God back in the church because this is
[26:57] what is promised do you believe that do
[27:01] you believe that all glory in our God
[27:03] we had Kalish right now here a few
[27:06] nights I went across the butt of the
[27:07] bits over the Paducah Kentucky crossed
[27:09] into Evansville and but a buzz word
[27:12] wasn't me I said it's just kept burning
[27:14] on my heart a message and I know that
[27:18] something God has promised on the
[27:21] opening up of the power and yet I'm
[27:26] waiting no for him so this is real the
[27:30] power have to open up something after
[27:33] turn the key to open up this power then
[27:36] he talked about a vision here he said I
[27:38] walk around cleared my throat and he
[27:41] looked at me z-bo Jesus raised up his
[27:43] hands
[27:44] feinted didn't come till next morning I
[27:46] have an idea what he looks like
[27:48] I've been feeling for the last months
[27:50] I'll see him again
[27:51] pretty soon that he revealed something
[27:55] that's fixing to come forward
[27:57] oh brother if I have it right God
[27:58] forgive me if I'm wrong but seen it in
[28:00] the scripture
[28:01] seeing that he arose ascended up he
[28:04] received a new name that no man know
[28:06] then I see him coming in his power so
[28:08] everything is tied together it shall be
[28:10] revealed in the standards new name new
[28:13] walk new life something after turn so I
[28:16] want to challenge you tonight that you
[28:18] under prophecy or glory that God great
[28:22] things are still fixing to happen oh boy
[28:25] don't be worried
[28:26] poor glory to God beyond the expectation
[28:29] that woman had an expectation that one
[28:32] that became before the unjust judge she
[28:35] had an expectation of hearing her case
[28:37] or glory to God she had that expectation
[28:40] and the judge was unjust here Fiat God
[28:43] here here man but wouldn't it coming she
[28:46] keep coming because she wanted to get
[28:49] her expectation fulfil Oh glory to God
[28:53] and God put that parable to set it up to
[28:56] show you the quality of perseverance
[28:58] that you have to have in believing the
[29:02] prophecy that has to be fulfilled
[29:04] William Brennan is not here he is within
[29:07] us to call him up or glory that God he
[29:11] can do nothing at this point in time but
[29:14] God is risen and you and I believe that
[29:17] God is waiting on you and I to come into
[29:21] position to come into a place Oh
[29:24] hallelujah
[29:25] so he said no watch be on the verge
[29:28] brother somebody come back from Kenan
[29:30] the grapes are good it is our land it is
[29:35] our land God give it to us we serve we
[29:40] can take it Oh glory to God I want a a
[29:44] bigger a man than that this is our land
[29:47] God give it to us God give it to us we

[47:31] Holy Ghost
[47:32] the object was always to bring down the
[47:34] power of the Holy Ghost but God
[47:36] commendeth power when the wood was lost
[47:38] to the ages because the fullness of the
[47:40] would have to have restored to get the
[47:42] fullness of the power back in the church
[47:44] so because the word was lost gonna have
[47:46] to first gather the word because a word
[47:48] and spirit this one so the world was
[47:50] divided in seven parts to seven ages it
[47:52] took seven messengers to restore back

[52:03] that's the reason they got this big
[52:05] bunch of grapes brought it back for
[52:06] evidence I can see Caleb and Joshua with
[52:08] on their shoulders matching Judea just
[52:11] singing the Jubilee song they had
[52:13] evidence they could prove it was a good
[52:15] man they put back and give all the
[52:17] journal grip if they wanted one of the
[52:19] cluster a bunch of grapes no Joshua and
[52:23] Caleb when they heard the murmur of the
[52:24] people call them fellas hustle back so
[52:28] fast now them able to talk the spirit of
[52:31] negatives and on darkness and doubts
[52:34] over the people they are the leaders
[52:38] there is so qualify for all fools who
[52:42] ever fool inside but they are the elders
[52:44] and when they breed their prophesy over
[52:48] the people it was weak I take it that's
[52:53] anointed upon the people the people
[52:54] didn't go in on these men were supposed
[52:56] to represent the people bring back
[52:59] evidence to the people the people in law
[53:01] whether in like whenever has come back

[55:11] and I'm wants a prophesied to pull you
[55:14] out and I'm filled the book rent in the
[55:17] hands of the original owner so when the
[55:21] book come down prophecy had to come back
[55:23] all to call you because God bringing it
[55:25] back to original so when Jesus came he
[55:28] said you had to be born of the word and
[55:29] the spirit to bring it back to Adam
[55:31] again
[55:31] whoever fell from Jesus from the correct

[1:02:28] faith that was once delivered unto the
[1:02:30] Saints it once had it they lost it we
[1:02:33] are fighting for it
[1:02:35] that's why you asked the question when
[1:02:36] the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:02:38] faith books not books and tapes not
[1:02:40] believers that I believe the prophet and
[1:02:42] second message songs not that not shall
[1:02:46] I sign message songs shall I find the
[1:02:48] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:02:51] Saints there's only one faith like this
[1:02:53] eight hallelujah defeat Michael rough it

[1:03:32] that he wouldn't establish churches
[1:03:34] without delivery listen to them them
[1:03:35] going good as long as I'm still sure
[1:03:39] because Balaram says the devil know that
[1:03:42] the true church is mark 16 in
[1:03:47] all glory the automobile be brought to
[1:03:49] me preach that to me the devil more

[1:04:04] an action so the Prophet said the seven
[1:04:08] thunders those voices will be known by
[1:04:11] the real true church because those
[1:04:13] voices those thunders when the after the
[1:04:16] voices of that group not to take the
[1:04:18] word and hundred year it was faced and
[1:04:20] cut the heavens they could do whatever
[1:04:22] they wanna do words will be expressing
[1:04:25] the faith that's restored back in the
[1:04:29] church do I am God hallelujah
[1:04:46] nobody can tell much faith I know words

[1:05:05] apostasy he said feet defeat there's
[1:05:09] only one faith this is one around
[1:05:10] concern defeat no I want to read Luke 18
[1:05:13] and he read it parable a man ought to

[1:05:29] wonders he would have interim speedily
[1:05:30] nevertheless when the Son of Man comment
[1:05:33] shall he find faith on it then Barham

[1:08:13] any one of us here insane person had to
[1:08:15] deal with them they have many times

[1:08:30] now now when a person is crippled and
[1:08:34] the Holy Spirit gets ahold of them if
[1:08:39] the devil's got that much power to make
[1:08:42] a man three or four times human strength
[1:08:44] how much power can God put in a man
[1:08:47] that's what come upon him to make him
[1:08:49] walk in the strength of God will he have

[1:09:03] years you're looking at the strength of
[1:09:04] God the power of God hallelujah that
[1:09:08] could hit that person with so much power
[1:09:10] that bones could walk you know and I

[1:10:04] like a young new man because the power
[1:10:07] of the Holy Spirit is on him where he's
[1:10:10] a nothing a message power of the Holy
[1:10:14] Spirit but I'm a pastor I best be shan
[1:10:18] tong he is the other he for i guess
[1:10:28] it'll not be laughing a lot of things
[1:10:30] because he that demon spirit that
[1:10:33] Luciferian spirit that spirit that that
[1:10:36] jesus put some volts on but just it is
[1:10:38] written is written he no power
[1:10:41] Jesus was a mystery man to him Jesus was
[1:10:46] the most mysterious man ever encountered
[1:10:49] because when he said if Dobby Jesus
[1:10:51] never demonstrated any power toward him
[1:10:53] as far as he can send that I can't touch
[1:10:56] that man because I'm man so connectivity
[1:10:57] would not that bad yeah I mean solar
[1:11:01] power from Jesus alone when he has
[1:11:04] finished with him listen you know he get
[1:11:06] dream he could really take a holiday
[1:11:09] memory beat somewhere and take a rest
[1:11:11] off on different things but Jesus not
[1:11:12] get dream Jesus no fully charged he went
[1:11:18] into the wilderness and was tested and
[1:11:20] when he come true the charge come back
[1:11:22] on him without charge quantum is a
[1:11:25] temple check the book and say the Spirit
[1:11:28] is upon me no the devil listen to Nolan
[1:11:30] Nolan fries mister he says upon me we
[1:11:33] are not to meet the Tati reading
[1:11:34] scripture then it's a disdain this
[1:11:36] scripture is fulfilled
[1:11:37] thanks many I open up big and sin whoa
[1:11:39] whoa what you're talking about sir all
[1:11:43] glory has auditorium out but you have
[1:11:46] something what happy for you
[1:11:48] no he could prove what's upon him or
[1:11:50] give the Lord a shout any man can say
[1:11:53] the Spirit is upon me
[1:11:55] but when Jesus said that he was able to
[1:11:57] prove that because he did the words that
[1:12:00] norther man oh my god my lord god help
[1:12:11] me tonight I came up here wasn't feeling
[1:12:13] well
[1:12:14] but I feeling so charge now I could run
[1:12:16] to a truth or glory to God hallelujah
[1:12:19] praise God so when that spirit come upon
[1:12:22] him he could prove it
[1:12:28] he had confidence in every prophecy
[1:12:31] concerning his life so he could say
[1:12:34] destroy this body entreaties I'll raise
[1:12:35] it up because David prophesy about him
[1:12:37] and he knew the word of prophecy so he
[1:12:40] could take it and prophesy based upon
[1:12:42] what the scripture said that he was the

[1:14:30] nothing good mining he was really a bad
[1:14:32] case I'm Jesus cross on that the Coderre
[1:14:35] he was so evil not the man the man was
[1:14:37] all right it's not the man when you see
[1:14:40] a person like that don't ever think it's
[1:14:42] the man it's the devil as in the man
[1:14:44] then the maniac and the platform that
[1:14:47] night was going to kill me in Oregon or
[1:14:48] night when it comes to me him spitting
[1:14:50] in my face calling me snake in the grass
[1:14:52] before nearly 10,000 people it wasn't a
[1:14:55] man he's a man that eats and drinks and
[1:14:57] sleeps before the family loves and like
[1:14:59] you and I am but that was the devil in
[1:15:01] him doing that and you never cast a
[1:15:04] devil out by the wrong attitude it takes
[1:15:07] love to do that and love is the most
[1:15:09] powerful force there is in the world
[1:15:12] when I say here at when I say yeah that
[1:15:15] hallelujah hallelu is the most powerful
[1:15:17] force
[1:15:18] when I say era most powerful force or
[1:15:22] glory to God hallelujah amen now if you
[1:15:26] notice the devil is always hit it is of
[1:15:31] the devil
[1:15:32] now let's go wrong on the binoculars no
[1:15:34] and when people hit someone remember
[1:15:38] it's a terrible devil to despise or
[1:15:40] dislike you mustn't do that so when your
[1:15:44] blood can take this one you need a blood
[1:15:46] transfusion
[1:15:48] you need a blood of Jesus so dislike and
[1:15:51] hit and you can't take this one lies
[1:15:54] issues that you have see any other get
[1:15:57] at ultra system you mustn't do that this
[1:16:01] is what a brown-nose did the whole
[1:16:03] lesson this question answer the question
[1:16:04] answer yes some stuff aside that is what
[1:16:06] bringing Jesus a night he said that he
[1:16:08] continued no now remember Jesus had an
[1:16:10] assignment when you pray our Father
[1:16:12] who packed in heaven when he come down
[1:16:15] he said if you don't from your heart
[1:16:16] forgive every man his trespasses neither
[1:16:18] your heavenly Father forgive you your
[1:16:19] trespasses
[1:16:20] you mustn't do that now where the devil
[1:16:22] creates a power of hatred to run out on
[1:16:26] the platform to kill me which he
[1:16:28] physically was more than able many times
[1:16:30] he could have held me up past with two
[1:16:31] fingers like by my belt because he
[1:16:34] weighed 262 on somebody palms six foot
[1:16:36] and a half seven foot tall great fellow
[1:16:38] he just hit a preacher on the street
[1:16:39] with his fists broken collarbone and jaw
[1:16:41] injured him put him in a spitter he
[1:16:43] hated preachers so he ran out there to
[1:16:46] kill me no and so on okay we'll continue
[1:16:50] you know now in that man that was of
[1:16:53] those spirits was castled is fine and
[1:16:55] Ghaderi
[1:16:55] some of those poor people are out there
[1:16:57] remember remember Devils birthday Devils
[1:17:00] always live and there will be a time
[1:17:02] when Devils will have to die they will
[1:17:04] become totally unrelated but now they
[1:17:07] are live and they work from generation
[1:17:10] to generation
[1:17:12] upon human beings some of them in the
[1:17:14] form of cancer some of them involve
[1:17:16] epilepsy some other form of tuberculosis
[1:17:18] they get into the flesh but seemingly
[1:17:21] they are powerless until they get into a
[1:17:23] prison or glory of God they have to
[1:17:28] operate you a person which brings us to
[1:17:30] another thought and the Holy Spirit
[1:17:34] covers the earth but is almost helpless
[1:17:38] until it gets into you unto me God is
[1:17:42] dependent on you and I the Holy Spirit
[1:17:46] the earth is full of the Spirit of God
[1:17:47] it's brought out but it cannot operate
[1:17:50] until it comes into us we human beings
[1:17:55] are operated or give the Lord a shout Oh
[1:17:59] hallelujah
[1:18:00] so do whatever mom says the word was
[1:18:04] invisible until it became fresh then
[1:18:07] they will become visible Oh hallelujah
[1:18:10] so he said it's so powerful he said God
[1:18:14] is depend upon you and I that is full of
[1:18:16] the Spirit of God it's poured out it
[1:18:18] kind of operate until it comes into us
[1:18:20] we human beings to operate so all these
[1:18:22] mysteries all these great revelations
[1:18:25] were
[1:18:25] is to get us out of the way that the
[1:18:29] Spirit of God would have actually have
[1:18:31] the preeminence --is which fulfills the
[1:18:33] second fall of the great mystery of God
[1:18:35] the first full was reveal himself the
[1:18:38] second part was to have the three
[1:18:39] eminences and the third part was to
[1:18:41] restore back Eden or glory to God so
[1:18:44] when God could find a man and he said
[1:18:46] there is my spirit flowing freely
[1:18:48] that man is blown out you have no self
[1:18:51] in there you have no pride in there he
[1:18:54] has no aim and everything is cleared out
[1:18:55] then I can flow freely so the devil
[1:19:02] wants to take us over to operate under
[1:19:04] him so he gets in a mild form he starts
[1:19:08] in sin if he can hold them Justin a
[1:19:11] righteous man a good man I let him go
[1:19:12] ahead and try to be good like that if
[1:19:15] you can hold him until he is dead that's
[1:19:17] what he wants to do he's got him because
[1:19:19] no matter how righteous you are how good
[1:19:21] you are home all you are how clean you
[1:19:23] are how honest you are you will never
[1:19:25] get the helm until you are born again so
[1:19:29] the devil of mine holdin I'm holdin I'm
[1:19:30] holdin until they did I know they can't
[1:19:33] make it
[1:19:37] nobody path back to the question the
[1:19:39] spirits the window that man you were
[1:19:40] like a maniac does the same thing in
[1:19:42] people today is them spirits thousand
[1:19:44] time Towson's and the devil come in with
[1:19:46] little opium it's like a schoolgirl they
[1:19:48] just started to do get her to smoke a
[1:19:49] cigarette

[1:23:30] enjoying the wood tonight I don't know
[1:23:33] about you but I am alright no we know
[1:23:37] something about the 10th vision and
[1:23:39] Barry Manilow was teaching him about the
[1:23:42] pools and so on like that and he catch a
[1:23:44] small fish and the angels tell him I
[1:23:46] truly enough to dress with explaining
[1:23:47] things just get piece of that you know
[1:23:49] and he said you cause impersonations
[1:23:51] then I started weeping I look took the
[1:23:54] string I was trying to Street it out he
[1:23:56] looked at me and I wondered what he was
[1:23:58] going to do he said keep your line
[1:24:00] straight in these kind of times so yes
[1:24:03] so I cut the line right through again
[1:24:04] and just as I did at that time he taken
[1:24:07] me up all again and he stood me up in
[1:24:09] the air over agreed order to him or tent
[1:24:11] and I made an altar call and hundreds of
[1:24:15] people Reeve softly sweetly were weeping
[1:24:17] settle my the altar receiving the Lord
[1:24:19] Jesus and I said that looks better and
[1:24:21] then there was a nice smooth spoken
[1:24:24] gentleman stuff that I said no wild but
[1:24:26] a brand is rested a little bit with line
[1:24:28] up the fair line you all with prayer
[1:24:30] cast beginner at a certain line to my
[1:24:32] right so I stood I looked and I could
[1:24:35] see to my left from where I was standing
[1:24:37] there was a little building sitting
[1:24:39] there a little building built like that
[1:24:41] and the people here look like they went
[1:24:44] around the tent and and then I seen a
[1:24:47] woman in the UM Allen stretcher was lean
[1:24:49] and a man behind I was standing on the
[1:24:51] crutches and they were standing there
[1:24:53] waiting for their turn and there was a
[1:24:56] lady taking down their names and things
[1:24:58] and then there was a canvas stretched
[1:24:59] that no one could get her wrong that
[1:25:01] tent and I wanted to watch this and
[1:25:03] listen to how it is now and watch the
[1:25:06] difference and I heard that always goes
[1:25:09] every time we have a healing service
[1:25:10] that's what happened was
[1:25:12] that's the we'd always song did song
[1:25:14] like like like we in the bush but I did
[1:25:16] it it always been that way and I felt it
[1:25:18] I heard it rather moving I looked and
[1:25:22] there was a soft light moving away from
[1:25:24] me and went down and went into that
[1:25:27] little buildin
[1:25:28] so the light went into that little
[1:25:30] buildin and there was something
[1:25:31] different between the light and the
[1:25:33] angel because he was still there with me
[1:25:36] and the light that went into the
[1:25:37] building and this angel still speaking
[1:25:40] behind me which is
[1:25:41] man he said I will meet you India and I
[1:25:45] said I don't understand why I and there
[1:25:47] he said watch I'm this woman when she
[1:25:49] come out of this unbalance stretcher she
[1:25:51] was pushing the stretch on the other
[1:25:53] side and the lady asked her what
[1:25:55] happened she said I don't know it just
[1:25:57] happened I've been on the stretcher I've
[1:25:59] been on his bed for years and here come
[1:26:01] the man packing his crutches and they
[1:26:03] ask him what he didn't know he was
[1:26:05] commented at the platform that testified
[1:26:07] I don't understand it there so they were
[1:26:10] passed into this room this room and were
[1:26:12] being healed and then he's I don't
[1:26:15] understand what's in there and then the
[1:26:17] Holy Spirit the angel begin to put it
[1:26:19] back in the wood for him watch he's
[1:26:21] always scriptural but I'm saying that he
[1:26:23] said did not our Lord see window prayers
[1:26:25] be not as the hypocrites that like to
[1:26:28] make a show he said enter into the
[1:26:30] secret closet and when you have done so
[1:26:32] closed the door then pray to your father
[1:26:34] that sees in secret and he that sees in
[1:26:36] secret shall reward thee openly and he
[1:26:38] said you remember that name that he will
[1:26:40] hunt him that you dream about
[1:26:41] he said I'll meet you in there and this
[1:26:43] time it will be a public show and then
[1:26:46] the vision left me so that was 1956 but
[1:26:50] in 1963 the 7cu night he was just
[1:26:53] talking back some of it I just want to
[1:26:55] read that back he picked me up he took
[1:26:57] me up set me high and I meter was going
[1:26:59] on and looked like a tent or a car TV or
[1:27:01] some sort and looking there was a little
[1:27:03] box I placed on the side I seen the
[1:27:05] light that was talking above me the
[1:27:07] light that you see in a picture it will
[1:27:10] away from me like that went to the tent
[1:27:12] and said I'll meet you in there and this
[1:27:15] will be the temple and you won't tell it
[1:27:19] to nobody or glory that God has a place
[1:27:22] for him to meet you he's going to meet
