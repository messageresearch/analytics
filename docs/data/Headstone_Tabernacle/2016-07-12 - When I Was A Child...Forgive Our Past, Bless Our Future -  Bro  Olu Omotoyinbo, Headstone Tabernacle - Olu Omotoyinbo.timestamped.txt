[43:26] God richly bless you amen if you have
[43:29] your Bibles I'd like to attention
[43:31] quickly to two portions of scripture
[43:33] Hebrews chapter 4 and 1 Corinthians
[43:37] 13
[43:41] Glory Hebrews 4 I have one verse to read
[43:44] from there and um 1 Corinthians 13 I
[43:47] have one verse to read from there
[43:50] also Hebrews 4 and verse 12 reads on
[43:55] these wise
[43:57] for the word of God is quick and
[44:00] powerful and sharper than any two Ed
[44:03] sword piercing even to the dividing a s
[44:08] of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[44:11] Marrow and he's a deser of au thought
[44:14] and intents of the heart amen let me
[44:17] read that verse again for the word of
[44:20] God is quick sir that means it's strong
[44:23] that means it it it it's very is very
[44:26] incisive before you move it's got to its
[44:29] Target you can play around with the word
[44:32] you can first be fast and loose with the
[44:35] word the word is really precise and to
[44:36] the point that's what means is is quick
[44:39] and Powerful sharper than any to Ed so
[44:42] piercing even to the divid of Soul and
[44:45] Spirit and we're going to talk about
[44:46] that divid this morning amen because
[44:49] that's where the devil hides amen but
[44:51] the word of God follows and changes the
[44:53] devil to that divid under there so
[44:55] there's no hiding place for the devil
[44:58] not in here not in your life amen
[45:01] because the word of God will will find
[45:03] the devil wherever he's hiding can you
[45:06] say
[45:07] Amen there's no Hiding Place Satan we
[45:10] got news for the devil this morning he
[45:13] has no place to hide Hallelujah can you
[45:16] shout hallelujah hallelujah amen because
[45:19] the water God will fish him out
[45:22] amen and he's a h uh p even to the divid
[45:27] son of Soul and Spirit and of the joints
[45:29] and Marrow and is a designer of the
[45:31] thoughts and intents of the heart so
[45:34] whatever you're thinking of this morning
[45:36] whatever the problem whatever the desire
[45:39] the word of God knows it before you even
[45:41] say it and that's why people come to
[45:43] church on Sunday morning and the pastor
[45:45] say something there sure somebody told
[45:46] the pastor what the word of God it's
[45:49] quick it's sharp he knows just what's in
[45:51] your heart right to that Divine it can
[45:54] go right there and fish what your Des
[45:56] eyes amen what a blessing amen and 1
[46:01] Corinthians
[46:04] 13 are you
[46:07] happy you get to be after last night
[46:10] yesterday morning you've got to be happy
[46:13] amen 1 Corinthians 13 this is a great
[46:15] chapter on the love of God like you know
[46:17] all the brothers have spoken about not
[46:19] feel your love but I Gap love verse 13 I
[46:22] mean verse 11 says when I was a child
[46:26] I spake as a
[46:28] child I understood as a child I thought
[46:31] as a child when I became a man I put
[46:35] away childish things now what are these
[46:37] childish things here childish things
[46:40] speak as a child understand as a child
[46:44] and think like a child if you notice
[46:46] that's in the
[46:47] reverse that's childish a child speaks
[46:52] before they understand what they're
[46:53] saying before they even think about it
[46:56] that's childish because when you do that
[46:58] your behavior is out of control you have
[47:01] no Behavior you have no life you just
[47:04] talk speaking is talking about Behavior
[47:07] your what you speak is talking about the
[47:08] external person your speech your life
[47:12] when you speak without without
[47:14] understanding without thinking that's
[47:16] childish children just do things and
[47:19] that's why they have so many things that
[47:20] they a lot of baggage but unfortunately
[47:22] many adults also live like that but Paul
[47:25] is saying here that when I became a man
[47:28] I put away all these childish things
[47:31] because God is not going to adopt
[47:32] children he's going to adopt men who
[47:34] have come to the stature of a perfect
[47:37] man amen can you say amen amen amen

[54:40] amen that direct quote from Brother Bram
[54:42] because brother Bram on the message um
[54:44] the contest 962 December 31st in praying
[54:48] he said Lord make us F servants forgive
[54:51] our past and bless our future and I just
[54:54] feel that we are entering a new time a
[54:56] new season where the blessing of God is
[54:58] going to overtake you amen amen and
[55:01] respect of that um I have a few cont
[55:03] scriptures but I'd like to read um one
[55:06] of them from Genesis
[55:09] 22 um if you have B can just open it I'd
[55:11] like to read from Genesis 22 verse 15
[55:13] through Verse
[55:24] 18
[55:29] Genesis 22 and: 15 read on these wise
[55:31] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[55:33] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[55:35] and said by myself have I sworn say the
[55:37] Lord for because thou Hast done this
[55:39] thing and has not withheld thy son th
[55:41] only son then in blessing I Will Bless
[55:44] thee and in multiplying I will multiply
[55:47] thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
[55:49] as the sea which upon the seash shore
[55:52] and thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[55:55] his enemies and in thy seat shall all
[55:56] the nation of the earth be blessed
[55:58] because thou has obeyed my voice amen
[56:01] may the Lord add his BL of your holy
[56:03] words
[56:12] amen amen amen amen can you say amen
[56:16] amen amen when I was a child amen well
[56:20] acts one it says but you shall receive
[56:22] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[56:25] you now many times you hear Christians
[56:27] talk about that that that verse or that
[56:29] chapter because we know the Holy Spirit
[56:32] B what was talking about because Jesus
[56:34] had come he brought a brand new way of
[56:37] of learning a brand new way of speaking
[56:40] never a man speak like Jesus Christ the
[56:42] people testify never a man did the
[56:44] things on this earth like Jesus Christ
[56:46] did he wasn't like the scribes and fares
[56:49] the Sinners came they felt comfortable
[56:52] in his presence not because he agreed
[56:54] with their sin
[56:55] but because there was just a pres around
[56:57] him he was not like the scribes and the
[56:59] Pharisees he was sent to for that very
[57:02] purpose to save Sinners to win them and
[57:05] deliver them from their lifestyle amen
[57:08] little babies were comfortable with him
[57:10] all the ecclesiastical thing was not
[57:12] about him at all he was like an ordinary
[57:14] man people didn't even know who he was
[57:17] it had to take Judas to identify him to
[57:19] the people a man with such a great
[57:22] purpose on the face of the Earth God
[57:24] himself in human skin people didn't have
[57:26] a clue what he was who he was what he
[57:29] was there doing amen but Jesus when he
[57:33] died and rose again and he came back
[57:36] when he was going back after 40 days he
[57:38] gave the disciples those famous Words
[57:41] which was the promise he said but you
[57:43] shall receive power after that the Holy
[57:46] Ghost is come upon you and you shall be
[57:48] witness unto me in Judea Samaria onto
[57:51] the uttermost parts of the earth and
[57:53] from that time up until now every
[57:55] Christian believer has that promise that
[57:58] promise of hanging over him the promise
[58:00] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:02] Hallelujah but unfortunately
[58:04] unfortunately you don't hear the B of
[58:07] the Holy Ghost spoken about in our camps
[58:09] no more you may be seated amen you hear
[58:12] all this talk about brother Bram brought
[58:14] the Mysteries brother BR preached all
[58:15] the Mysteries we don't need to have one
[58:17] more mystery preach because brother
[58:20] reveal all the mystery because in the
[58:22] days of the voice of the seven Angel
[58:25] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[58:27] of God shall be finished as he had
[58:30] declared to his servants the prophets
[58:32] and malach already came and finished all
[58:34] the mystery if you believe that say
[58:37] amen hallelujah you may be
[58:40] seated amen amen we don't have to have
[58:45] one more mystery hidden Mystery un
[58:48] hidden Mystery whatever we don't need it
[58:51] because Malachi for reveal every mystery
[58:53] and that's good enough cor us
[58:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but
[59:00] that Prophet also tell us that once you
[59:02] are baptized in water in Christian
[59:04] baptism the promise of the Bap of the
[59:06] Holy Ghost hangs over you for all Time
[59:08] and Eternity amen hallelujah but you
[59:11] don't hear that spoken about again but
[59:14] Jesus said you are going to do that and
[59:16] then you're going to be my Witnesses
[59:18] amen hallelujah and brother bam said how
[59:22] men ought to be formed into the word
[59:25] image of Jesus Christ and of the passing
[59:27] of the Holy Ghost hardly anything is
[59:29] spoken but here we are in this meeting
[59:31] here and I believe today before this
[59:33] minut is out God is going to baptize
[59:36] some Souls with the baptism of fire I
[59:39] believe with all my heart the person of
[59:41] the Holy Ghost is going to pour out here
[59:44] today I believe that with my whole heart
[59:47] can you shout
[59:52] hallelujah amen you may be seated
[59:57] hallelujah amen but listen here this
[1:00:01] promise here let you understand a few
[1:00:03] things does it mean we only receive
[1:00:05] power after we are baptized the B of the
[1:00:07] Holy Ghost
[1:00:09] no no because you'll find in the Bible
[1:00:13] there are different levels of power that
[1:00:16] is talking about St John 1:12 says to as
[1:00:19] many as give them to them he give power
[1:00:22] to become the sons of God Amen you hear
[1:00:24] Romans 1:16 says amen I am not ashamed
[1:00:27] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's
[1:00:29] the power of God unto salvation that's
[1:00:31] not the power for the B of the Holy
[1:00:33] Ghost amen so you see the different
[1:00:35] levels of power he's talking about
[1:00:38] hallelujah hallelujah and we are here
[1:00:41] this morning want to understand where
[1:00:43] our power lays because the devil is
[1:00:45] interested in knowing where your power
[1:00:47] lays the devil wants to know where your
[1:00:49] power isay because if you can find out
[1:00:52] where your power is he will cut the
[1:00:53] power off
[1:00:55] and you become like an ordinary man but
[1:00:57] you are no ordinary man you are the
[1:00:59] bread of Jesus Christ you are F of power
[1:01:04] end time holy ghost power in the form of
[1:01:06] a message on the inside of you amen you
[1:01:10] may be seated Glory Glory Glory Glory
[1:01:15] Hallelujah Hallelujah may be seated it
[1:01:19] doesn't mean that before we get the bom
[1:01:21] of the Holy Ghost we a powerless Branch
[1:01:23] it doesn't mean that
[1:01:25] is just telling you when you get B of
[1:01:27] the Holy Ghost the power raise up a
[1:01:29] little higher because Jesus said in Luke
[1:01:32] 10 his disciple he said behold I give
[1:01:34] you power to tread on serpents and
[1:01:36] scorpions and overall the power of the
[1:01:39] enemy they had power already but he
[1:01:41] talking about a different kind of power
[1:01:43] a different level of power and that's
[1:01:45] what we are speaking about today
[1:01:51] hallelujah
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be
[1:01:57] seated amen amen talking about power
[1:02:02] Jesus promised us power amen but we have
[1:02:05] power already Peter had power he cast
[1:02:08] out Devils amen he went on a missionary
[1:02:11] trip the Bible said they came back
[1:02:13] rejoicing and they said the demons were
[1:02:16] subject to us in your name and Jesus
[1:02:18] said don't Rejoice with that amen but
[1:02:21] Rejoice that your names are written in
[1:02:23] heaven amen and Peter with this great
[1:02:26] ministry casting out devils and all that
[1:02:29] this same Peter did not have enough
[1:02:30] power to stand up to a little
[1:02:34] girl this little girl said you are one
[1:02:36] of them you are a gallan said stoping
[1:02:38] young lady I don't know that man
[1:02:40] Hallelujah so he had power but his power
[1:02:43] was not
[1:02:44] enough his power could not meet every
[1:02:47] challenge that he had and I bet today
[1:02:50] this morning in this house there are
[1:02:52] believers here who have power
[1:02:54] but you feel your power is just not the
[1:02:56] challenge there are young people here
[1:02:59] who feel their power is not the
[1:03:00] challenge can I get a witness back can
[1:03:04] somebody say Amen but you shall receive
[1:03:07] power the Holy Ghost will come upon you
[1:03:10] it will baptize your
[1:03:13] soul

[1:03:36] obligated to give you what it takes to
[1:03:39] live for him because he chose you you
[1:03:43] didn't choose him he chose you so he's
[1:03:46] obligated to give you what you need to
[1:03:49] live for
[1:03:50] him

[1:04:11] we want to break through every sound
[1:04:12] barrier we want to break through every
[1:04:14] sin barrier we want to possess every
[1:04:16] gate of the enemy every gate of the

[1:04:45] seated so when God talk about given
[1:04:47] power when Jesus said about I will you
[1:04:50] shall receive power he's not talking
[1:04:52] about power like we see demonstrated
[1:04:54] many place today in Christian circles
[1:04:56] he's not talking about power over
[1:04:58] another person he's not talking about
[1:05:00] power over another man amen God never
[1:05:03] gave any man the power over another man
[1:05:07] because he gave man power over the Earth
[1:05:10] not over another man no he gave man
[1:05:13] power over the Earth not man to rule
[1:05:16] over man he gave man the power over the
[1:05:19] Earth and his spirit is what rules over
[1:05:21] every man so he's not talking about
[1:05:23] controlling power
[1:05:24] he's not talking about power to control
[1:05:26] another person to control this church or
[1:05:28] that church no he's talking about power
[1:05:30] indwelling power that's going to come on
[1:05:32] the inside of you to control you and
[1:05:35] control the
[1:05:42] Earth so God like every leader every
[1:05:47] parent he gives you what you need you
[1:05:49] may be seated oh
[1:05:51] hallelujah amen so when he's talking
[1:05:54] about giving us power he's talking about
[1:05:56] empowering us amen he's not talking
[1:06:00] about power that just rides rough sh
[1:06:03] over everybody no he's not talking about
[1:06:05] power that takes over other people's
[1:06:08] rights disrespect people controls people
[1:06:11] for whatever reason he's not talking
[1:06:13] about that he's talking about holy ghost

[1:07:03] that God is talking about he put this
[1:07:05] power in Adam in a seed you may be
[1:07:08] seated amen you've got to always go back
[1:07:11] to the original because like brother
[1:07:13] Roberto was someone one of Brothers
[1:07:15] about yesterday you hear a lot of lot of
[1:07:17] things spoken about today and you know
[1:07:19] from what Jesus said you ear because you
[1:07:21] don't understand the scriptures ER and
[1:07:24] coming because people do not understand
[1:07:26] the scriptures according to what Malachi
[1:07:28] forau but if you go back to the original
[1:07:31] and leave it the way the prophet said it
[1:07:34] not try to make it better it's so clear
[1:07:36] it's so plain God said let us make man
[1:07:40] in our image that's so clear there's no
[1:07:42] ambiguity about that that's very very
[1:07:45] clear can I get a witness amen
[1:07:48] hallelujah hallelujah now God he made
[1:07:52] man in the Garden of Eden in his own
[1:07:54] image Hallelujah now this power he put
[1:07:58] in Adam to operate on the face of this
[1:08:00] Earth here remember I told you when God
[1:08:03] Gave You gives you a job to do he gives
[1:08:04] you the power to do the job you might as

[1:08:11] to be a daughter you might as well go to
[1:08:13] rest on that you will live this
[1:08:16] Christian Life not because you have the
[1:08:18] power he promised the power
[1:08:21] Hallelujah you are not going to backslab
[1:08:24] no you are not going to go back there is
[1:08:27] not enough devils in history to make you
[1:08:30] go back on your commitment Hallelujah
[1:08:32] you are going to press your way through
[1:08:35] you are going to overcome you are going
[1:08:37] to possess every G of every devil
[1:08:40] Believers love
[1:08:41] this every young man every young woman
[1:08:45] every father every mother every brother
[1:08:47] and sister you will overcome you are
[1:08:50] going to overcome it's God's job to see
[1:08:53] to that
[1:08:54] you are going to overcome oh
[1:08:57] Hallelujah glory glory
[1:09:01] glory
[1:09:02] amen glory to God Amen so this power
[1:09:07] here that he talking about here we can
[1:09:11] running through the Bible and we see God
[1:09:13] gave this power to adamj at the very
[1:09:15] beginning to make Adam a Son of God and
[1:09:19] Adam broke every barrier there was no
[1:09:21] barrier no gate that could come before
[1:09:23] him Adam possessed it even the Bible
[1:09:26] said Adam was not deceived Adam of his
[1:09:28] own free will of his own choice went
[1:09:30] after his wife which turn out to be a
[1:09:32] type of Christ going after us but Adam
[1:09:35] was not deceived he took every gate
[1:09:38] Hallelujah and this power in Adam wasn't
[1:09:41] was in a seed God put this power in a
[1:09:44] seed now the power of a seed it all
[1:09:47] comes down to a seed amen and that's why
[1:09:49] you should be careful what seeds you
[1:09:51] listen to and we as Minister be careful
[1:09:53] seat we s because there's power in a
[1:09:56] seed hallelujah hallelujah you bring you
[1:09:59] believe a wrong seed you believe a wrong
[1:10:01] power because there's power in a seed
[1:10:04] because every seed has power within
[1:10:06] itself to reproduce itself but God in
[1:10:09] the beginning he put the power in a seed
[1:10:12] and every child is a seed every one of
[1:10:15] us began as a seed every man woman born
[1:10:17] and girl began as a seed and one thing
[1:10:20] about the seed the seed is complete
[1:10:22] every little seed is complete if it's a
[1:10:25] seed of an acor tree the acor tree is
[1:10:27] there already the stem the leaves
[1:10:29] everything is in that little seed the
[1:10:31] seity is complete the only thing that is
[1:10:34] immature and need to grow and out of
[1:10:37] that little sea will come out everything
[1:10:39] that's in the seed Hallelujah Glory
[1:10:44] Glory so the seed any seed that all is
[1:10:48] complete amen but just need to grow am
[1:10:51] it's complete even though it is immature
[1:10:53] but just needs to grow and Genesis
[1:10:56] clearly sets out for us the power of a
[1:10:58] seed Hallelujah Genesis 1 26- 28 clearly
[1:11:03] spells out the power in the seed that
[1:11:05] was in Adam Adam's seed was in his soul
[1:11:09] and your seed is in your soul but want
[1:11:12] you to see the need why you need the
[1:11:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:11:17] because too many Christians are
[1:11:18] comfortable without the pass of the Holy
[1:11:20] Ghost in their lives and they think they
[1:11:22] get along just fine no you don't get
[1:11:24] along just fine have you received the

[1:13:04] me ask you a
[1:13:06] question hallu where did Adam seed come
[1:13:09] from you know the story but let me just
[1:13:12] say it again and I mean you hear it from
[1:13:15] I mean from the ministers every time but
[1:13:16] let me just say it again because like
[1:13:18] second Peter 1 says even though you know
[1:13:20] them and you be established in the
[1:13:21] present truth so don't be said if I'm
[1:13:23] saying things you know as a matter of
[1:13:25] fact most of the things you hear in the
[1:13:26] message most of them you know just we
[1:13:28] bringing different perspectives to it
[1:13:30] that's why I say we don't need any one
[1:13:31] more message everything has been preed
[1:13:33] to
[1:13:34] us what we need is the power of God to
[1:13:37] make that message real in your life not
[1:13:40] just talk the message but to be a living
[1:13:42] manifestation of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ Hallelujah there's a Ministry on

[1:14:15] we are preaching that you may be see
[1:14:22] it
[1:14:35] Adam bust on the sin Genesis
[1:14:39] 1 but where was he coming from you know
[1:14:41] the story Elohim great eternal spirit
[1:14:45] well talk about that but notice the very
[1:14:47] essence of the spirit of Elohim was love
[1:14:51] l o v e
[1:14:54] agapy love not feel your love agapy love
[1:14:58] as a matter of fact feel your love is
[1:15:00] the cause of all your problems because
[1:15:02] of all my problems is why the church is
[1:15:04] sitting stunted because the church has
[1:15:07] accepted feel your love in place of a
[1:15:08] gap love Hallelujah but the holy spirit
[1:15:12] is turning that around in this hour here
[1:15:14] in this season the holy spirit is
[1:15:16] turning it around that you might run
[1:15:18] back to your first love that God Ste in
[1:15:21] the church on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:15:24] God's spirit seven per Spirits was a
[1:15:26] spirit of love and he wanted to have a
[1:15:28] man in His image but how would a spirit
[1:15:31] have an image made unto him God is a
[1:15:34] spirit and those that worship Him
[1:15:36] worship in spirit and in truth so he
[1:15:38] could not have an image of a spirit can
[1:15:40] you catch the picture of an of a spirit
[1:15:42] you can't so Elohim to be able to get
[1:15:45] his image on the earth he formed himself
[1:15:48] to what flesh in a theophany he changed
[1:15:51] his Mas for one purpose alone so he can
[1:15:53] have an image he changed his mask and
[1:15:57] became a theophany and all those seven
[1:15:59] spirits of Love put into that body
[1:16:03] called the theop it was still a spirit
[1:16:05] but now it was a body had a
[1:16:08] form and once he had a form then you
[1:16:10] could take an image of a form and it was
[1:16:12] at that spot he said let us make man in
[1:16:15] our
[1:16:16] image after our
[1:16:22] likeness
[1:16:24] what was it seven spirits in a body the
[1:16:27] spirit of love in a body is the image
[1:16:30] he's looking for
[1:16:32] Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah say
[1:16:35] hallelujah somebody say hallelujah
[1:16:37] somebody huj oh you are not hearing me
[1:16:40] say hallelujah somebody hallelujah

[1:16:59] leave this convention today you are
[1:17:00] going to shake them
[1:17:08] off
[1:17:09] Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so seven
[1:17:13] spirits of
[1:17:15] Love con to a body called the theop and
[1:17:19] now God said we have an image now we
[1:17:22] have a body now we can for my
[1:17:23] image so
[1:17:25] God Adam B the don't believe anything
[1:17:29] else those are the new things in town
[1:17:31] don't believe it still what the prophet
[1:17:34] said amen nothing against any man but
[1:17:36] you got to be careful you got to be
[1:17:37] careful what seeds you s and what is you
[1:17:39] believe
[1:17:41] amen these not playing games this is
[1:17:43] your soul and I'm going to show you in a
[1:17:46] minute or few minutes how the devil
[1:17:48] brings all these loose ends and to get
[1:17:51] at the source of your power and weaken
[1:17:53] you and you know you have power locked
[1:17:55] in on the inside but that power cannot
[1:17:58] flow out and that power flows out you
[1:18:00] are
[1:18:09] powerless so what happened GL GL Elohim
[1:18:13] formed Adam an image of the theophany
[1:18:17] theop is the word So Adam was the word
[1:18:19] image on the face of the Earth it was an
[1:18:21] image of the theophany theop image what
[1:18:23] image on the face of the Earth and
[1:18:25] that's why we find Adam Genesis 12628 it
[1:18:28] was seven spirits it was seven spirits
[1:18:31] in a
[1:18:33] body and Adam's Body in Genesis 1228 was
[1:18:37] his soul his theophany in SE form that
[1:18:41] was Adam there a it wasn't a theophany
[1:18:45] it was a spirit man it was a theophany
[1:18:47] man not a theophany like the logos he
[1:18:50] was an image of the
[1:18:51] theophany Hallelujah he wasn't God he
[1:18:54] was an image of
[1:18:58] God my image is in my likeness but my
[1:19:01] image is not me you can never an image
[1:19:03] become
[1:19:04] me God made that so clear didn't he
[1:19:08] didn't he make that so clear let us make
[1:19:11] man in our
[1:19:18] image I'm not really worried about
[1:19:21] that amen amen so God am he put into
[1:19:26] Adam these seven spirits and what he was
[1:19:28] in Adam was the love of God put into his
[1:19:31] soul and this love of God you may be
[1:19:33] seated this love of God in Adam's Soul
[1:19:35] that's what made him in the image of God
[1:19:37] but this love of God was split up into
[1:19:39] seven spirits now I told you a seed is
[1:19:42] immature amen a seed is complete but
[1:19:44] immature but in Adam's case God dropped
[1:19:47] into his soul and Adam seed did not go
[1:19:49] through the growing process amen Adam
[1:19:52] seed bypass the maturing process and God
[1:19:55] dropped in his soul a mature seed on the
[1:19:57] spot amen So Adam came here a mature
[1:20:01] perfect seed of the seven spirits of the
[1:20:04] love of God in his soul an exact image
[1:20:07] of God on the face of the Earth he
[1:20:08] didn't have to grow into anything he
[1:20:10] bypassed that growth stage and became a
[1:20:13] perfect man on the face of the Earth
[1:20:14] with the seven spirits and the love of
[1:20:16] God in his soul projecting out a Son of
[1:20:20] God on the face of the Earth can
[1:20:21] somebody shout hallelujah
[1:20:31] Hallelujah and that was Adam Soul there
[1:20:34] was seven spirits there seven perfect
[1:20:39] Spirits not a little Buton for seven
[1:20:42] perfect Spirits the love of God in Adam
[1:20:45] Soul Hallelujah and the Bible said but
[1:20:48] God looked around there was no man to te
[1:20:50] the soil so this Lord and this power in
[1:20:54] his
[1:20:55] soul God wanted an outlet for it to do
[1:20:58] some work on the face of the Earth so
[1:21:00] God took this power this soul and put
[1:21:04] into a body in Genesis 2:7 and Man
[1:21:06] became a living soul and what was in
[1:21:09] Adam's soul in Genesis 1 126 and 28 it
[1:21:11] lived out through him through his flesh
[1:21:13] and we saw Adam walking through the
[1:21:15] garden seven spirits the love of God
[1:21:17] doing the Great Signs The Works amen a
[1:21:19] tree never died before Adam a tree was
[1:21:21] too tall Adam made it come down what was
[1:21:24] that it was the love of God speaking
[1:21:26] through those seven spirits in the
[1:21:27] Garden of Eden Hallelujah can you say
[1:21:30] amen hallelujah you cannot disconnect
[1:21:33] the love of God from the power that was
[1:21:36] operating through Adam's
[1:21:46] Body
[1:21:48] Hallelujah and Adam walked through the
[1:21:51] garden
[1:21:54] a little later Eve joined him and
[1:21:56] brother bam said Adam Spirit toward his
[1:21:58] wife Eve he anointed Eve with his what
[1:22:01] image
[1:22:02] spirit is what image Spirit the love of
[1:22:05] God R in seven perfect Spirits he
[1:22:08] anointed Eve with that say Adam was kind
[1:22:12] loving and
[1:22:13] sweet that was his spirit that was a
[1:22:16] spirit that walked through the Garden of
[1:22:17] Eden it was a loving Spirit it was a
[1:22:20] kind Spirit it was a sweet spirit
[1:22:29] can you relate think William brandham
[1:22:32] now one man that got back to Eden
[1:22:36] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:22:39] Amen but while men
[1:22:41] slept the enemy came in while men slept
[1:22:45] the enemy came in and came to the weaker
[1:22:47] vessel and walked on her over time over
[1:22:51] and over and over again until she gave
[1:22:55] away you may be
[1:22:59] seated notice when Adam became a living
[1:23:03] Soul what happened his soul Genesis 2:7
[1:23:06] Man became a living Soul what happened
[1:23:08] immediately brother explain a spirit and
[1:23:11] a soul of this world came into Adam so
[1:23:14] Adam now had a spiritual soul with seven
[1:23:17] spirits on the inside of it and a human
[1:23:19] spirit and a flesh body yes but the
[1:23:22] object was to get what was in his soul
[1:23:24] to walk on the outside to to to to to to
[1:23:29] uh to to what he say now to walk in the
[1:23:31] garden to teal the ground so what was
[1:23:34] inside was to come out in his flesh like
[1:23:37] brotherto spoke about the vine and the
[1:23:40] branches hallelujah hallelujah Adam need
[1:23:44] to bear fruit on the outside but there
[1:23:46] was no hands no lips no legs to Bear the
[1:23:49] Fruit by the power to Bear the fruit was
[1:23:51] on the inside di so God gave him a human
[1:23:55] spirit and gave him a physical flesh
[1:23:56] body so that through his soul there be a
[1:23:59] connection with his human spirit and
[1:24:01] there'll be a connection with his flesh
[1:24:02] body and his soul will operate through
[1:24:05] the element and the operation of the
[1:24:08] human Spirit and the flesh body to do on
[1:24:10] the face of the Earth what God wants
[1:24:12] Adam soul to do can you say
[1:24:18] Amen so there was a connection there
[1:24:21] Adam soul to Adam's Spirit to Adam's
[1:24:24] flesh there was a connection there
[1:24:26] Hallelujah there was a free Channel
[1:24:28] there Adam was a Channel of
[1:24:30] communication from his soul to his
[1:24:33] Spirit to his flesh Adam's Soul was a
[1:24:36] control tower in Adam so was seven
[1:24:39] spirits in Adam so was the love of God
[1:24:42] and the love of God control his Spirit
[1:24:43] the love of God control his flesh and
[1:24:45] Adam till the
[1:24:50] soil Hallelujah
[1:24:57] and the devil was not in the picture
[1:24:59] even though he was there he was bound he
[1:25:02] was bound as bound could be because from
[1:25:06] Adam's Soul flow the love of God flow
[1:25:10] the seven spirits into his human Spirit
[1:25:13] his human Spirit was under the control
[1:25:14] of the seven spirits and from there
[1:25:17] flowed the love of God into his flesh
[1:25:19] and the love of God did the works on the
[1:25:20] face of the Earth amen of the Son of God
[1:25:23] and we saw a Son of God on the face of
[1:25:24] the Earth Genesis 126 Adam was a son
[1:25:27] Genesis 2:7 he was a manifested son
[1:25:29] Genesis 126 Adam was a born son Genesis
[1:25:32] 2:7 Adam was a positionally born son he
[1:25:36] was always a son but he had to be
[1:25:38] manifested to the world of course you
[1:25:40] are a son today you are a daughter today
[1:25:43] but the world wants to see the sons of
[1:25:45] God it's not enough to say I am a son
[1:25:48] the world want to see a
[1:25:50] manifestation of the sons of God God I
[1:25:53] want to see a manifestation you want to
[1:25:55] see a manifestation of the sons of God
[1:25:58] oh
[1:25:59] Hallelujah and that's what we are
[1:26:01] walking towards that's what we are
[1:26:02] Marching to and we are not going to rest
[1:26:05] until we see that it's not enough to
[1:26:08] make any
[1:26:17] claims you may be
[1:26:20] seated so notice what happened happen
[1:26:23] what
[1:26:26] happened there was a connection there
[1:26:29] between the soul and the spirit the
[1:26:32] flesh was just a
[1:26:34] slave just a slave to do whatever was
[1:26:36] commanded to do but there's a connection
[1:26:38] between the soul and the spirit I'll
[1:26:39] read you a few question shortly
[1:26:42] yeah and in that connection there
[1:26:44] there's a dividing as
[1:26:47] yeah in that connection there there's a
[1:26:49] spot there if the devil can get in there
[1:26:52] or or God gets in there going to
[1:26:54] determine the course of your life
[1:26:56] am so when you hear the word of God the
[1:26:59] Bible Hebrews 4 tells us when you hear
[1:27:01] the word like you're hearing this
[1:27:02] morning the word of God is quick and
[1:27:04] sharp where is going to it's not going
[1:27:06] to your head it's not going to your
[1:27:07] flesh is going to that divid that's the
[1:27:10] connection there what happens when you
[1:27:13] hear the word intellectually you hearing
[1:27:14] the message when you hear the word your
[1:27:17] intellect understands it right away
[1:27:19] what's your intellect your brain your
[1:27:20] human Spirit what is that your affection
[1:27:22] your memory your reason your imagination
[1:27:24] and
[1:27:25] conscience Hallelujah but God doesn't
[1:27:28] send the word to your conscience doesn't
[1:27:29] send the what to your human Spirit the
[1:27:31] word is headed for the soul so what
[1:27:33] happened listen here now listen
[1:27:36] now
[1:27:39] Hallelujah listen now listen listen what
[1:27:43] happens when you hear the word this
[1:27:45] morning it goes past your flesh amen but
[1:27:48] your human Spirit grabs it because you
[1:27:50] understand English language or French or
[1:27:52] or Spanish or Portuguese whatever
[1:27:53] intellectually you hear the message but
[1:27:55] your human Spirit cannot take a decis
[1:27:58] what to do with the word firstly what
[1:28:00] happens it goes into your soul because
[1:28:03] the soul is the control tower how does
[1:28:05] the word go into your soul the
[1:28:07] conscience takes that word into your
[1:28:09] soul to check up with the soul whether
[1:28:12] what you are hearing is true or not the
[1:28:15] conscience go into the soul to get an
[1:28:17] answer from the soul the control tower
[1:28:20] what he should answer back
[1:28:23] let me give you an
[1:28:25] example let me give you an example let
[1:28:28] me give you an let me give you an
[1:28:29] example young man young man you are on
[1:28:31] your you are doing your homework at
[1:28:33] night on the internet and
[1:28:35] then excuse me pornography pictures jump
[1:28:40] up it's not just a picture it's direct
[1:28:42] into your soul the devil wants to get
[1:28:43] into your soul but God didn't give the
[1:28:45] devil your soul what happens
[1:28:46] intellectually you see this this feels
[1:28:49] good but what happens immediately your
[1:28:51] conscience grabs it
[1:28:52] and goes into your soul passes that
[1:28:54] divid and asks is this right to do or
[1:28:57] not and your soul if the word of God is
[1:28:59] there says don't do it shut that thing
[1:29:01] off listen so your your conscience goes
[1:29:05] back and tells the human Spirit shut
[1:29:08] that thing off and you shut it
[1:29:11] offall hallu that's the pattern that's
[1:29:14] what happens every single
[1:29:19] time that's how the word goes to that
[1:29:22] dividing a th between Soul and Spirit
[1:29:25] can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:27] hallelujah glory to
[1:29:41] God so you can see it right away you can
[1:29:45] see right away the conscience can go
[1:29:48] into the so the conscience is the sense
[1:29:50] that passes over amen that dividing line
[1:29:54] that dividing as that separating line
[1:29:56] amen and the conscience goes into the
[1:29:58] soul to check up with what's in the soul
[1:30:01] is this according to the blueprint or
[1:30:03] not is according to the word of God is
[1:30:05] according to what the message says which
[1:30:07] is in your soul amen and the Soul says
[1:30:10] no conscience goes back
[1:30:13] amen amen now your reasoning can say
[1:30:16] that's old fashion I don't believe that
[1:30:19] what happens I read from from Brother
[1:30:21] bam amen
[1:30:22] it Grieves the soul in other words your
[1:30:25] reason tell the soul to shut
[1:30:31] up and brother bam said if that happens
[1:30:34] often enough that you tell the soul to
[1:30:37] shut up you tell to shut up what happens
[1:30:40] you grieve the soul
[1:30:42] away and that's why a man becomes
[1:30:45] separated from God that's what happened
[1:30:47] in the Garden of Eden their soul was
[1:30:49] griefed
[1:30:50] away can somebody shout hallelujah
[1:30:53] hallelujah when your soul is G away you
[1:30:55] are lost out of connection with God out
[1:30:59] of contact with God but that's why Jesus
[1:31:01] came to connect us back to
[1:31:04] God
[1:31:15] hallelujah
[1:31:18] hallelujah the source of Adam's Power
[1:31:21] laid in his soul and the devil knows I
[1:31:24] got to find the source of that power
[1:31:27] I've got to disconnect them from the
[1:31:28] source of that power once he suced in
[1:31:30] disconnecting Eve from the source of the
[1:31:32] power all Eve had was a human reasoning
[1:31:36] that's correct to judge what the devil
[1:31:38] is talking about and your human
[1:31:40] reasoning doesn't have enough power in
[1:31:41] it amen to confront the devil your human
[1:31:44] reasoning only has
[1:31:46] willower human strength human energy it
[1:31:50] cannot overcome anything
[1:31:52] your human power and that's how many
[1:31:54] Christians live with their will power
[1:31:56] with their human power and that's why
[1:31:58] they sometimes up and sometimes down but
[1:32:01] Jesus said you shall receive power we
[1:32:05] will place the power right back into
[1:32:06] your soul and connect your soul and
[1:32:10] spirit back again in the name of Jesus
[1:32:14] Christ oh
[1:32:15] Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen
[1:32:21] the word of God is
[1:32:22] sharp sharper than any so go into that
[1:32:26] div you may be seated am but what
[1:32:29] happens what happens many people even
[1:32:32] when they get saved when they get saved
[1:32:35] they don't read the Bible they don't
[1:32:36] know what the message says they just go
[1:32:39] along and leave on half tank or leave on
[1:32:41] empty and just go along and just just
[1:32:44] just tradle along like that and what
[1:32:47] happens you get your channel blocked
[1:32:50] amen because Christianity 1 Peter 3:21
[1:32:54] says is the answer of a good conscience
[1:32:57] your conscience go into the soul and
[1:32:59] gets an answer and tells your spirit and
[1:33:01] your spirit controls the body what to do
[1:33:03] amen that happens every Split Second
[1:33:06] before you do anything that's the
[1:33:07] procedure because the soul is the
[1:33:09] control
[1:33:20] tower
[1:33:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:33:26] when
[1:33:27] Adam when Adam and his wife
[1:33:31] chose what did the devil do what did the
[1:33:33] devil do what the devil do I'm I'm just
[1:33:35] skipping ahead I'll finish shortly I
[1:33:37] shortly what the devil do let me just
[1:33:40] bring this to a close let what the devil
[1:33:42] do I I don't mean I'm closing right now
[1:33:44] watching a look at your watch I see are
[1:33:47] you taking taking taking a look at your
[1:33:50] watch get out of there I'm going to get
[1:33:52] her shortly but give me a few minutes
[1:33:54] okay I won't send I Won't Say I'm
[1:33:56] closing eight times like brother Jesse
[1:33:58] said maybe I've done it about two times
[1:34:00] already but I won't do it times just
[1:34:02] count for me when I'm close to seven
[1:34:03] just point at me so I don't hold the
[1:34:07] record but
[1:34:11] listen what was in Adam's Soul was the
[1:34:13] love of God and the devil's object was
[1:34:17] to disconnect them from the love of God
[1:34:19] the love of God is power listen when God
[1:34:22] came on the face of this Earth when the
[1:34:23] logos which was the love of God in in a
[1:34:25] in a spirit body saided doing the work
[1:34:27] of creation what what did we find we
[1:34:29] found power we found the lust spoke Let
[1:34:32] There Be and let there be he spoke and
[1:34:35] Galaxy SW and Spa into existence love
[1:34:38] spoke and created the universe love
[1:34:41] spoke and created the trees the animal
[1:34:43] life in the sea on the land love spoke
[1:34:46] and did all of that love is the creative
[1:34:48] force of God love is the creative power
[1:34:50] of God love is the power that Adam
[1:34:53] needed on the face of the Earth to live
[1:34:55] in the Garden of Eden and this love was
[1:34:56] a manifestation of seven perfect Spirits
[1:34:59] Hallelujah it wasn't human love it was
[1:35:03] God's
[1:35:05] love AAP love let me show you where
[1:35:08] human love came into the
[1:35:14] picture and almost all of
[1:35:18] us do everything but this human feel
[1:35:21] your love and we are sure we have it but
[1:35:24] the other person doesn't have
[1:35:26] it we have a gape they have
[1:35:30] F but I'm going to show you in a minute
[1:35:33] how F Your Love Came in the picture you
[1:35:35] know what F your love is but M said is
[1:35:37] the kind of love you have for your wife
[1:35:38] your husband it doesn't mean that's the
[1:35:41] kind of love you should have for them
[1:35:43] because Jesus said love one another as I
[1:35:46] have loved you did not love us with feel
[1:35:48] your love our call Christian call is a
[1:35:52] Lord but we just settle for your Lord
[1:35:56] let me show what love is when the devil
[1:35:58] came in the G of Eden to Eve this was
[1:36:01] the object was to attack the love of God
[1:36:04] because he knew that was the power and
[1:36:06] that's what the us until the when the
[1:36:08] church gets to that
[1:36:11] spot just the Divine love will drop
[1:36:15] down and all that's wrong will be taken
[1:36:17] out because that's the love of God
[1:36:19] dropping down in the Mist the love of
[1:36:22] God will drop down not love like I I
[1:36:24] have it you don't have it no the the
[1:36:26] spirit of God will drop down in your
[1:36:27] soul and all that's wrong will be taken
[1:36:29] out not one sick person will be able to
[1:36:32] stand the sick will be healed the death
[1:36:35] El will be unstopped because La drops
[1:36:37] down because Lord was the power that
[1:36:39] walked in the Garden of Eden Lord was
[1:36:41] the power that created the universe and
[1:36:44] that's why we are going back to that
[1:36:45] love that's why God sent a prophet
[1:36:47] William Bram to drive us back to the
[1:36:49] love of God not feel your love G love
[1:36:52] glory to God amen amen amen so when the
[1:36:56] devil came to
[1:37:00] Eve had God
[1:37:02] said no has said what he did he said to
[1:37:06] show Eve what she was going to
[1:37:08] get said to show Eve what was going to
[1:37:11] benefit her that God was supposedly
[1:37:13] keeping from
[1:37:15] her it was showing Eve God knows the day
[1:37:19] you eat that fruit you'll be like a god
[1:37:21] God God knows you are going to get this
[1:37:24] he doesn't want to get it this is
[1:37:26] something for
[1:37:27] you you know what's in it for
[1:37:31] me that's
[1:37:38] filo that was the problem in Eden they
[1:37:41] exchanged agape love for fil your love
[1:37:44] and brother bham said feeling love is
[1:37:46] the problem in the church that's right
[1:37:49] brother he said even lost sex
[1:37:52] adultery is a perversion of of
[1:37:56] that love the original love is a gapy
[1:37:59] love and in the Garden of Eden the devil
[1:38:02] show them feeling love what feel love
[1:38:04] was in it for me Isn't the husband and
[1:38:06] wife the husband to the wife the father
[1:38:09] to the children children to the father
[1:38:10] just think of it I don't want to get
[1:38:12] think of it just what's in it for me but
[1:38:15] Jesus said love one another as I have
[1:38:17] loved you amen look alive from the other
[1:38:19] person's perspective not from your
[1:38:22] perspective but Fe love doesn't do that
[1:38:24] Fe love is interested in his own thing
[1:38:27] love is in you treating me right if my
[1:38:29] wife treats me right then I'll treat her
[1:38:31] right Feel Love is conditional Feel Love
[1:38:33] is Performance Based if you don't
[1:38:36] perform well I won't have anything to do
[1:38:38] with you but AG Gap love is
[1:38:41] unconditional when you are good when you
[1:38:43] are bad it loves us regardless
[1:38:46] hallah
[1:38:48] hallelujah hallelujah so in the Garden
[1:38:51] of Eden the devil the serpent Lucifer
[1:38:55] exchanged by sweet
[1:38:59] words the love of God a gap love fulfill
[1:39:03] love was in it for
[1:39:05] me if you eat this fruit you are going
[1:39:07] to get this eve you're going to become
[1:39:09] like a God God's keeping this from you
[1:39:12] he said that's
[1:39:14] true just thinking it that's our life
[1:39:17] amen and from there the perion come
[1:39:19] there the man who commits adult
[1:39:21] the young man who takes what doesn't
[1:39:23] belong to him is just focus on yourself
[1:39:26] that's feeling love just focus on self
[1:39:28] and self and self alone like brother R
[1:39:30] said last night self life and brother BR
[1:39:32] said eternal life is living for others
[1:39:35] amen the only two types of life eternal
[1:39:37] life or self life and eternal life is
[1:39:40] the love of the god a gapy love and self
[1:39:43] life is f Your
[1:39:50] Love
[1:39:52] yeah so what happened so what happened
[1:39:57] God ass say this station here and said
[1:39:59] no this this doesn't look too good go so
[1:40:02] what happened was
[1:40:04] Adam and Eve had no character formation
[1:40:08] no process of going through this F
[1:40:10] development and just have Perfection
[1:40:12] dropped on their laps so to
[1:40:14] speak and they let the power drain
[1:40:17] out easy come easy go
[1:40:21] that's good so God said I will restore
[1:40:26] I'll restore this church right back I'll
[1:40:28] restore it right back to the G of Eden
[1:40:29] again but not the way I did it before no
[1:40:33] not the way I did it before because the
[1:40:35] devil succeeded in disconnecting Adam
[1:40:38] and Eve from God disconnecting their
[1:40:40] soul from the control of God Amen and
[1:40:42] that's when they became lost but Jesus I
[1:40:44] mean God came on the spot and connected
[1:40:46] them back in other words gave them
[1:40:48] salvation again not Redemption salvation
[1:40:50] they lost Redemption and God wanted them
[1:40:53] to go through a process to get back to
[1:40:55] the Redemption you are not going to get
[1:40:56] it on the spot again he was going to
[1:40:59] take a process and that process was to
[1:41:01] form character in them to make them
[1:41:03] labor to let them work hard them labor
[1:41:07] to get some character to get some
[1:41:09] behavior before they'll be gifted with
[1:41:11] this power
[1:41:19] again
[1:41:22] so God the story of the Gospel having
[1:41:26] been to get us back to this power that
[1:41:28] Adam had in the Garden of Eden to
[1:41:29] connect our souls
[1:41:36] back when Adam
[1:41:38] fell he lost that state of glory and
[1:41:42] power and became like a little child
[1:41:44] notice when God created Adam he didn't
[1:41:46] create a child he made a man in His
[1:41:48] image Adam was a man he wasn't a child
[1:41:52] wasn't a little child he was a man he
[1:41:55] bypassed that child who stage would not
[1:41:57] even know it existed until Adam fell and
[1:41:59] when Adam fell he became like a little
[1:42:01] child didn't know left from right hand
[1:42:04] anymore didn't know where he was at
[1:42:06] anymore he lost the power and God said
[1:42:08] I'll take you back there but you are
[1:42:09] going to grow through the process this
[1:42:11] time around you are going to grow from a
[1:42:13] child into adulthood and manhood again
[1:42:17] oh
[1:42:18] Hallelujah Glory
[1:42:21] that's the gospel story of redemption
[1:42:24] that's the story of redemption the
[1:42:26] growth in Grace in Jesus Christ
[1:42:29] Hallelujah and what happened there
[1:42:32] amen God he split this growth
[1:42:35] process into
[1:42:37] stages and Jesus came to make a way to
[1:42:41] connect us back to God again amen and
[1:42:43] this connecting back to God again to
[1:42:45] connect a way back for us for our soul
[1:42:47] and our spirit to remain connected when
[1:42:50] we are born in this worldall here our
[1:42:52] souls are andrain from God our souls are
[1:42:55] just doing the dictates of our minds we
[1:42:58] are doing what we want not what the word
[1:43:00] of God tells us to do we are separated
[1:43:02] from God our souls are lost not in
[1:43:04] contact with God but Jesus comes and
[1:43:07] comes to your life maybe you get saved
[1:43:09] one day and what happens just the word
[1:43:11] of God come into your soul you repent
[1:43:13] you give your heart to Jesus Christ what
[1:43:15] happens you become a baby in Jesus
[1:43:17] Christ you become like Adam and Eve when
[1:43:20] they were restored by God In the Garden
[1:43:21] of Eden right am and what happens your
[1:43:25] soul that was lost from God is connected
[1:43:28] back to God
[1:43:30] again connected back to God again you
[1:43:33] and God can have a channel now God can
[1:43:35] speak to you and you can speak back to
[1:43:38] God but that's not enough enough that's
[1:43:40] not
[1:43:42] enough that's not enough because in that
[1:43:44] channel that power that comes from that
[1:43:46] channel is not powerful enough to face
[1:43:49] all the things the devil will throw at
[1:43:51] you because your channel has been
[1:43:54] clogged up and that's why it takes you
[1:43:56] the next step of sanctification to clean
[1:43:58] up the channel day in day out dying out
[1:44:02] and clean up the channel clean up the
[1:44:04] channel to where the Holy Ghost can have
[1:44:06] a free flow between your soul and your
[1:44:09] spirit to to to free up the channel of
[1:44:12] the field and the ungodliness free it
[1:44:15] up Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:44:20] Hallelujah and when that child is fed up
[1:44:22] he said now you are going to receive the
[1:44:24] Holy Ghost and let me tell you why the
[1:44:26] Holy Ghost Bap is so
[1:44:30] important you can be saved I can assure
[1:44:33] you your life of Salvation saved
[1:44:36] justified by faith is not enough you
[1:44:38] experience it you know it you know
[1:44:41] yourself you know it's not enough you
[1:44:43] you you have power because there's power
[1:44:45] in your soul but this power for an
[1:44:47] outlet to control your
[1:44:49] flesh
[1:44:53] but this Outlet is still clogged up with
[1:44:55] stuff and that's why sanation com in
[1:44:58] there to to to unplug the outlet so the
[1:45:01] power in the soul can have a free
[1:45:07] flow but when you are baptized with the
[1:45:09] Holy Ghost this is what happens there
[1:45:12] the person of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:45:14] power to connect your soul and your
[1:45:16] spirit together and nothing can separate
[1:45:19] them again
[1:45:21] am nothing can separate them again the
[1:45:24] Holy Spirit comes into your soul and the
[1:45:27] Holy Spirit anoints the seed in your
[1:45:30] soul anoints the word in your soul and
[1:45:32] out of that word breaks out the power
[1:45:34] and that power flows through your
[1:45:36] channel into your spirit to control your
[1:45:38] flesh
[1:45:39] body that's why you need the Holy Ghost
[1:45:41] baptism without the Holy Ghost you are
[1:45:44] just hoping so without the B of the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost you can you are not guaranteed of
[1:45:48] power you're not guaranteed of constant
[1:45:52] Victory
[1:45:54] Hallelujah without the prop of the Holy
[1:45:57] Ghost our young people are the control
[1:46:00] or the the Haren stance of their friends
[1:46:03] in school amen
[1:46:06] amen but with the Bas of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:09] amen the channel is cleared amen Jesus
[1:46:12] comes back in your soul in the control
[1:46:15] tower and he controls the channel the
[1:46:18] power flows from your soul into your
[1:46:20] human Spirit into your flesh body oh
[1:46:24] Hallelujah the power like Adam had in
[1:46:26] Eden Oh Glory to God amen amen amen
[1:46:32] glory to God Amen oh Hallelujah so there
[1:46:36] are many Christians today amen saved
[1:46:39] Christians but they just can't find the
[1:46:41] power
[1:46:43] amen they do things they'd rather not do
[1:46:46] amen and they going for adoption amen
[1:46:49] ministers Deacons
[1:46:51] name it fathers mothers young
[1:46:54] people because we are lacking the power
[1:46:57] of the spirit of God and when the person
[1:46:59] ghost come to your soul that becomes a
[1:47:01] man in Christ just creation makes you a
[1:47:03] baby in Christ but the holy spirit makes
[1:47:05] you a man in Christ and this man now
[1:47:07] stats to
[1:47:08] Art the statue of Jesus Christ to a
[1:47:11] perfect man to where you get back like
[1:47:13] Adam was in the Garden of Eden amen oh
[1:47:15] Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh brother
[1:47:20] brother
[1:47:23] amen my context here I've got to say
[1:47:26] that Georges 134 15 and 16
[1:47:29] somethings
[1:47:31] Sams like a Christian believer
[1:47:34] today watch something something had a
[1:47:38] lifestyle Thea didn't just happen upon
[1:47:41] something something had a certain
[1:47:44] lifestyle somethings was a Christian
[1:47:47] like a Christian but he had a lifestyle
[1:47:49] of sin yes and didn't bother
[1:47:52] him you know the reason why because when
[1:47:55] something shakes himself the power he
[1:47:57] feels the power
[1:48:00] again something forgot that actions have
[1:48:04] consequences all the time but what
[1:48:07] happen is that many times the
[1:48:08] consequences take time that's right
[1:48:11] before you get the result of Your Action
[1:48:14] and so because of that human beings that
[1:48:16] we are we don't remember the action that
[1:48:18] got us the consequence that's correct so
[1:48:20] something for a long time was going on
[1:48:23] empty was living on
[1:48:26] empty but had a certain lifestyle and
[1:48:29] that's how many Christians
[1:48:32] are no life a m can get on the platform
[1:48:36] he speaks and you know people are all
[1:48:38] over the place there and he has no
[1:48:44] life The Mystery of the foral and ones
[1:48:47] at the end time amen amen something was
[1:48:51] there for a long time something Shake
[1:48:53] himself when the time comes he feels the
[1:48:56] power but he was disconnected from
[1:48:59] God totally disconnected from
[1:49:06] God Samson told his parents I seen a
[1:49:10] girl get her for me to marry man said no
[1:49:13] he said get her for me to marry and the
[1:49:15] parents obeyed him and got in the girl
[1:49:17] to marry and he had problem after
[1:49:19] problem with his
[1:49:21] lifestyle he killed a lion saw some
[1:49:24] horny in it and gave a riddle to the
[1:49:27] guys and they said who what's stronger
[1:49:30] than a uh uh what's stronger than than
[1:49:33] um uh um um what's sweeter than than
[1:49:38] honey and what's stronger than the than
[1:49:40] than than a
[1:49:43] lion and give them a ridle he was just
[1:49:45] it was just was just having a time of
[1:49:47] his
[1:49:48] life but just leaving as carelessly as
[1:49:51] they
[1:49:53] come and
[1:49:57] friends too much has been
[1:50:01] invested too much has been invested in
[1:50:04] this
[1:50:05] gospel for us to live like
[1:50:10] that too
[1:50:13] much I know you don't hear it anymore
[1:50:16] people don't preach about the life
[1:50:18] they're just telling you about the
[1:50:20] Mysteries you are going to be adopted
[1:50:22] and you are you know whatever you are
[1:50:24] the Holy Ghost whatever but it doesn't
[1:50:26] work like that am but b t us there's a
[1:50:29] maturing there's a character formation
[1:50:32] process there's a character formation
[1:50:34] process to where you die out of
[1:50:37] yourself amen like he told us last night
[1:50:40] about going through Jordan going through
[1:50:43] Jordan and dying to self and forming the
[1:50:46] character forming the image of Jesus
[1:50:49] Christ in your life even by a revelation
[1:50:51] while you are looking for the spirit to
[1:50:52] come down
[1:50:55] Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen
[1:50:59] so Samson he went on like this for so
[1:51:03] long but one thing you got to understand
[1:51:05] one day one
[1:51:09] day the gas is going to run
[1:51:12] out Samson's lifestyle eventually caught
[1:51:14] up with him that's right eventually
[1:51:17] caught up with him something there to
[1:51:18] face the the fact that I need something
[1:51:21] more I can't live on borrowed strength I
[1:51:23] can't live on this this I can't keep
[1:51:26] going on
[1:51:27] empty and that's like you and I today we
[1:51:31] need power amen the holy ghost power in
[1:51:34] our lives in your life young
[1:51:37] man you don't need more Revelation on
[1:51:39] the word no you don't need more
[1:51:42] Revelation you need an experience with
[1:51:43] Jesus Christ for the power of God to
[1:51:46] fire baptize you for somebody to step
[1:51:48] into your soul oh
[1:51:51] Hallelujah glory to God Amen you need
[1:51:54] power in your life and that's why I'm
[1:51:56] telling you today something got to the
[1:51:58] point he finally cut up with him amen
[1:52:09] Delila said you don't love me if you
[1:52:13] love me you will not hide your power
[1:52:15] from me brother bam said the devil is
[1:52:19] always looking for the source of the
[1:52:21] church's power the source of your power
[1:52:24] is your seven spirits your seven lots of
[1:52:26] air and that's in your soul the devil is
[1:52:29] always looking for that and what the
[1:52:31] devil does he goes into that soul with
[1:52:33] his false teachings to mix up the
[1:52:37] power and once it does that you are
[1:52:39] disconnected from God and your soul gets
[1:52:42] away let me read you a quote from
[1:52:43] Brother bam here glory glory to God

[1:54:17] different thing in her soul amen the
[1:54:20] governing Center the control center the
[1:54:22] first time she grieved her soul back

[1:54:26] on her husband he is her intellect here
[1:54:28] her mind her spirit here is her soul
[1:54:30] here there's a separating line there

[1:55:08] spirit in the soul is telling you amen
[1:55:12] amen amen the Bible said the soul that
[1:55:15] sinth th Soul shall die that means to

[1:55:38] formal church that don't believe in
[1:55:39] those things on out to hog eat hog and
[1:55:42] the first thing you know the soul that
[1:55:44] condemns you for the first time you told

[1:55:50] immoral acts will become so dead to you
[1:55:54] you won't feel it anymore on and on
[1:55:56] you'll go and after a while death will
[1:55:59] catch up with
[1:56:00] you you are living out yonder your
[1:56:02] pastor will come and say all things are
[1:56:04] all right my sister you're ready to go
[1:56:06] now everything all right why with all
[1:56:09] the reasoning power she has she has gone
[1:56:11] to church she has given to charity she's
[1:56:13] done everything that's right she thinks
[1:56:14] so everything that's right in her mind
[1:56:16] she has followed the dictates of her
[1:56:18] mind amen and many people live just
[1:56:20] following the dictates of their
[1:56:22] mind just follow dict of their
[1:56:25] mind what brother bam said don't matter
[1:56:27] no more what the scripture says don't
[1:56:29] matter no
[1:56:30] more that there's no power in the church
[1:56:32] young people are like resigned to leave
[1:56:34] any kind of a life amen even adult
[1:56:40] still she has F this of her mind I know
[1:56:43] I should go to church I know I should be
[1:56:44] friendly I know I should treat my
[1:56:45] neighbor right I know I should do this
[1:56:47] and that intellect willpower amen but
[1:56:51] still what is it she has gried away the
[1:56:54] soul and then the hour of her death when
[1:56:57] she gets where to die she's laying on
[1:56:58] the bed and all at once she wake up she
[1:57:01] wakes up and holders oh my God I'm
[1:57:04] lost the pastor will say give her a
[1:57:07] hippo she's delirious and he'll shoot a
[1:57:10] hippo in in it and she'll try to speak
[1:57:12] she can't speak she'll M what is it her
[1:57:14] soul has caught up with her that's right
[1:57:17] what the is saying here
[1:57:20] when people have a
[1:57:22] lifestyle of sin and wrong and falsehood
[1:57:27] and ungodliness brother it gries the
[1:57:31] soul and you can so grieve the soul away
[1:57:34] and that's why that's is that's a Miss
[1:57:36] in Christianity Today that's right so
[1:57:38] many different groups even Among Us in
[1:57:40] the message but everybody is convinced
[1:57:42] they
[1:57:45] right somebody or some of the groups or
[1:57:48] all of us have grieved this Spirit way
[1:57:51] still We only listen to our mind the
[1:57:53] dict of our mind but the word of God
[1:57:56] cannot have everybody right and
[1:57:57] everybody is saying different
[1:58:02] things can I hear an
[1:58:04] amen
[1:58:06] Amen brother brah is showing you here
[1:58:09] the secret how you can say anything and
[1:58:14] you feel very good about
[1:58:17] it and it's all wrong your lifestyle is
[1:58:20] wrong your teaching is wrong and you
[1:58:22] feel very comfortable about it because
[1:58:25] you have gried away the Holy Spirit you
[1:58:27] have G away the soul because the soul is
[1:58:29] not going to fight with you he's going
[1:58:31] to war you and tell him shut up shut up
[1:58:33] this what the prophet said this is what
[1:58:35] the Bible said this is what the prophet
[1:58:36] said and you want to do your thing the
[1:58:39] soul goes away and you are L with your
[1:58:43] intellect your mind so you feel my group
[1:58:47] is right that one feels my group is
[1:58:49] right while we have gried away the Holy
[1:58:51] Spirit we have gried away the words of
[1:58:53] the
[1:59:01] prophet and the connection we have been
[1:59:03] disconnected from
[1:59:08] God if you preach falsehood you are
[1:59:11] disconnected from God and you got to
[1:59:13] make it right Amen to be connected back
[1:59:16] to God and when you repent repentance is
[1:59:18] the twofold thing you acknowledge your
[1:59:21] sin and you turn away from it you don't
[1:59:24] just turn away from it without
[1:59:26] acknowledging David said for I
[1:59:28] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[1:59:30] is ever before me if I don't acknowledge
[1:59:32] it it always stays there I can't get
[1:59:34] away from it I've got to acknowledge it

[1:59:38] say Amen am hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:59:42] to God amen amen amen oh
[1:59:48] Hallelujah
[1:59:50] let me finish this quote
[1:59:52] here when she's going to die because
[1:59:55] it's a soul that's going to give account
[1:59:57] to God but bam is saying here people let
[2:00:00] the human Spirits lead them so long and
[2:00:03] when they die the human Spirit doesn't
[2:00:04] go in the presence of God Spirit
[2:00:06] disintegrates into the atmosphere but
[2:00:07] the soul that you are told to shut
[2:00:10] up that you have made a sinner out of it
[2:00:13] comes back to you and shows you your
[2:00:18] life and that's he's going to answer the
[2:00:20] God and that's what he see many people
[2:00:23] as was the kind an episode he saw where
[2:00:26] the lady was dying and she had lived a
[2:00:29] lifestyle so
[2:00:32] wrong and because she wouldn't listen
[2:00:36] her conscience got tired her conscience
[2:00:38] became weak became defiled her soul took
[2:00:41] its leave and when she was dying she saw
[2:00:44] a lifesty before her and she wasn't
[2:00:45] ready for God then and she was crying
[2:00:48] crying
[2:00:50] please I'm lost I'm lost that's what
[2:00:52] he's saying
[2:00:53] here her soul has caught up with her
[2:00:55] before death not only women men who spun
[2:00:58] the love of Jesus Christ who has Tor him
[2:01:00] down made fun of it it will catch up
[2:01:02] with you someday I stand I'm standing
[2:01:04] here this morning you gri this so far
[2:01:06] you can't feel it no more but it'll
[2:01:08] catch up sometime again it will come
[2:01:10] back to you the da things the bad things
[2:01:12] the tattling the B the Babbling the back
[2:01:14] Bing the selfishness and things that
[2:01:16] you've done that will all come back to
[2:01:17] you someday laying on the de
[2:01:20] how the hippo needle in those days has
[2:01:22] stopped the death confession of
[2:01:23] thousands what is it his soul has cut up
[2:01:25] with him there that Soul and Spirit is
[2:01:28] this thin hair that the intellectual
[2:01:29] mind is fixing is fixing to fail it's
[2:01:32] only in the mind the intellectual what
[2:01:33] you live by is going to perish but that
[2:01:35] soul that you've griefed from your
[2:01:37] intellect is going to haunt you through
[2:01:38] eternity amen don't listen to that
[2:01:41] uncertain sound you believe the gospel
[2:01:43] in its fullness amen you say I went a
[2:01:45] church I do what was right I paid my th
[2:01:47] those things are all about us in ual and
[2:01:50] look when you are trying to stop with
[2:01:51] that Hipp needle let them be numbed up
[2:01:53] so they don't know nothing and they are
[2:01:54] trying to speak their soul has caught up
[2:01:56] with them they realize that they are
[2:01:58] reasoning their mind is perishing with
[2:02:00] their brain perishing with their brain
[2:02:02] the mind yes sir your mind will perish
[2:02:03] with your with your the death I'll prove
[2:02:06] it to you amen and it goes on it goes on

[2:02:12] fails to pour through the brain and the
[2:02:13] nerve sees then your mind goes away and
[2:02:16] your soul catches up with you he's just
[2:02:17] trying to tell you here like that we
[2:02:19] live by our intellect many times and we
[2:02:21] figure out with
[2:02:22] intellect and we cut off the soul cut
[2:02:24] off the word of
[2:02:30] God but that intellect will
[2:02:34] vanish when we are living here amen amen
[2:02:39] I'm just want to make you see a picture

[2:03:57] them in
[2:03:58] stages the power of salvation for us
