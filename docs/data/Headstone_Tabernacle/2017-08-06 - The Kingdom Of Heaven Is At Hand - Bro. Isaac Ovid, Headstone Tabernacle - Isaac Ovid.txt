courage to press into the heavenlies Lord we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen so greetings once again if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading both uh within the book of St Matthew we want to read from Matthew 3 and we're going to read from uh St Matthew 4 as well s Matthew 3 from verse one in Matthew 3 from verse 1 and in those days Came John the Baptist preaching ing in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and reading from St Matthew chapter 4 reading from verse 10 now this is after Jesus is tempted of the devil from verse 10 then say Jesus unto him get thee hand Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and nepalm that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaas the prophet saying the land of zabulon and the land of nepalm by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning and I trust that you are happy to be in the house of the Lord happy to be in the presence of the Lord there are so many people who don't have the Blessed privilege that we do to be in the house of God this morning there are so many people they are tied down to hospital beds there are so many people tie down into all kinds of different conditions and it is such a blessed privilege to be able to lift Your Hands In Worship be able to sing the songs of Zion and to be able to escape for a few hours from the cares of life and the hustle and the bustle and the routine and and and having to wake up in the morning to go to work it's it's good to to go to work and make money but there's more to life than going to work there's there's something more important than paying bills there's something more important than paying rent and morgage there's there's something more important than this natural life that we live in can the church say Amen so I have a message this morning my title is the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and a and for my subject citizens of the kingdom and an inspiration only perfect love can enter in can the church say amen so we read the scripture in Matthew 3 where John the Baptist he came and forun Christ as we all know isn't that right and he preached a message repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand when John was preaching that message it was a message of possibility it was a message of hope it was a message the people had never heard before the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand most people who heard John preaching didn't understand what he was talking about but John was doing as he was led by the spirit under the spirit of Elijah to forign Christ and he was preaching repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he broke the mold he broke the routine he went against the way the other ministers were ministering he went against the way everybody else was teaching repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand many people of that day didn't know they even needed to repent they were so used to their rituals so used to their Traditions so used to going into the temple and give and giving up their offering and their sacrifice But Here Comes John repent that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand a message of possibility a message of Hope message of redemption a message a way out a message to give people the the the the the the inspiration to do something different but it was also a message of judgment because whenever God gives a message his message always comes in twofold Mercy and judgment always comes together to accept it is Mercy to reject it is Judgment so John was standing there repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand hallu can the church say amen and from the days of John that message still applies to today the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now the world has had many kingdoms the Kingdom of Egypt the kingdom of Babylon the kingdom of the and Persians the kingdom of the Greeks and the kingdom of the Romans and later yet still after John would have died and gone on we would hear of the kingdom of France and the kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom but this Kingdom we're talking about this morning is not like any of these kingdoms this is a different Kingdom we are talking about the Kingdom of Heaven hallah the kingdom that the whole of creation has been waiting for and years we've been hearing it's at hand it's at hand means I could reach it it means I could touch it it's it's within reach it's the Kingdom of Heaven it's at hand it's it's just a couple millimeters away it's it's just right there when you enter into the economy of God measurement and Mathematics changes brother Shane so when Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he was not speaking in our time because he's not a creature of time he said a thousand a thousand years it's like a Daye ACC God the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand can the church say Amen you may be seated are we here this morning are we in the house of God this [Applause] morning so this Kingdom of the kir that we are speaking about there are many similarities to other kingdoms amen amen this Kingdom of Heaven is similar to other kingdoms because the Kingdom of Heaven has a king that's right that's and natural kingdoms also have Kings hallelujah it's also similar to Natural kingdoms because there's a royal [Applause] family and power only moves from a king to a member of the Royal Family [Applause] and the thing of it is it doesn't matter how sometimes that member of the royal family acts the fact that they are part of the royal family bring certain privileges bring certain benefits there are certain things that just come with the territory you cannot be the son of the king and and not have security you cannot be the son of the king and not be escorted you cannot be the son of the king and not have the red carpet roll out for you you may be seated for a minute when you study the quote unquote modern kingdoms of the world when when Prince whatever his name was I can't remember got married the whole world said almost a billion people was connected who was it Kate and who will and Kate that's right and the whole world paused and stopped in awe because a ceremony was taking place to marry somebody in the Royal family and there were parades and there were trumpets and there were cars and there were horses and there was red carpet and there was all kinds of stuff because the child of royalty was getting married and if man in all of his glory can put that kind of display for moments of Celebration how much more about this Kingdom that we are talking about when there's a reason to celebrate when one Soul comes back to God there's a celebration if you could only open your eyes this morning to see the parade that passed here this morning to see the trumpets that blew here this morning before you enter this building Angels had already lined up because royalty royalty was coming into the house of God oh can I get a witness Hall you may be seated so there are similarities between these natural kingdoms and this Kingdom we are talking about this morning in this Kingdom there's an army how could you have a kingdom without an army because you need to protect your domain you need to prot protect your subjects you need to protect your land so this Kingdom of Heaven also has an army can the church say amen and because Elisha was a citizen of that Kingdom when they went out to investigate who was happening to find out what was happening in the secret chambers of the king of Syria anybody with me and they say we don't know who telling the children of Israel what's going on they say we suspect is that man Elisha he's always praying he's always in the spirit he's always on fire and when they send the Syrian Army to surround him the little boy the little servant with Elija got so scared he said what are we going to do and Elisha told that servant Open Lord open up this boy's eyes and when he opened up the boy eyes and he looked around he saw the Army from the kingdom he but wait a minute they are more for us than against us and that's because Elijah was a citizen of the Kingdom you may be seated we can we talk about his kingdom you may be see I want you to understand why I'm kneeling it down this morning because John the Baptist when he was preaching he didn't say repent for a church is at hand come on and when Jesus was finished dealing with the devil and said get there behind me Satan he continued and picked up John's message and said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jesus didn't come to start a church or start a group he came to introduce a kingdom and to remind you as Royal seeds of Abraham that you belong to a kingdom you don't belong to a church you don't belong to a group you don't belong to a pastor you are Sons and Daughters of the king of kings the Lord of lords he is mighty in battle royal blood flows through your veins oh somebody say Amen somebody say hallelujah you may be seated and because you are royalty you have to act a certain way before will what is it where princess what Kate Kate Kate before Princess Kate could get married to Prince Will she had to go to Etiquette training because she had not grown up in the Royal house but to be able to do the Royal things she had to be royally trained so that she could do the right things and not embarrass the throne because the throne has to be protected the kingdom has to be protected the monarchy has to be protected and God is also interested in protecting his monarchy he is interested in protecting his throne he's interested in protecting his kingdom so all these years we have been under training under the ministry of the word and how to behave ourselves how to conduct ourselves because the kingdom cannot come into view until we are in position to step into the kingdom and take our position in the Kingdom you may be seated I'm just here to encourage you this morning so the kingdom has an army Hallelujah whose role and rank and and and and role is to protect to defend right hallelujah our kingdom has an economy Hallelujah every Kingdom has an economy and it has a currency and I said in our convention the currency of our economy is different we have a different currency we don't need to take out dollar bills to pay for stuff in our economy in our in our kingdom you speak the word hallu our currency is spoken word our currency is faith if you shall say to this mountain you don't need to call moonan moving Mountain you don't need to call whoever else moving stuff now you don't need to call them and pay them if you shall say to this mountain Peter removed and cast in the sea there's no excavator tractor truck that can do what you could do if you have faith like a mustard seed to activate the spoken word power that was locked up inside of you before there was a moon be before there was a star be before you had a problem be before you had a trial that seed germ was placed inside of your soul what devil what demon What Spirit could take it out of you you are predestinated to be a son and daughter of the most high can the church say Amen the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready oh Hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand of Praise we're going somewhere this is just the background every Kingdom has laws and the laws is to govern Behavior the laws is to keep things in check and if natural man would have laws laws like treason there certain Kingdom if you speak against the king that TR in jail one time life sword it's true laws to protect Hallelujah laws to keep people in order so why should it be any different that this Kingdom also has laws the laws are not what we put in place the laws are the laws of the Kingdom because God put the laws in place to keep his kingdom in order so if you are a citizen of that Kingdom once the word comes forth and it's the law of God you readily take it because God told Joshua meditate on this Lord day and night and you shall have good success in other words God didn't want Joshua to forget the words of the law amen and the law is to guide you in how to act how to move when you should do certain things how you should conduct yourself how you should resolve conflict that's what the law is for kend the church amen in the Kingdom there are servants in the Kingdom but you are not servants this morning I'm not speaking to servants this morning I'm speaking to Sons and Daughters of the king and because you are Sons and Daughters of the king you have certain benefits amen and with the brandom said the problem with many of us we are living under our god-given rights we are living under our privileges in other words there are benefits for us that we are not even accessing because we are so caught up in our problem and in our trial and our limitation and feeling sorry for ourselves but when you understand that the kingdom is here now and the kingdom is within you all of a sudden you recognize that there are certain benefits you have access to certain things and can the church amen so there are many similarities between this Kingdom and natural kingdoms but there are also some differences because in this Kingdom there is no hatred in this Kingdom we're talking about there's no jealousy in this Kingdom there'll be no sin in this Kingdom in this Kingdom there'll only be Joy there'll be no crying in this Kingdom there'll be no sighing in this Kingdom there'll be no up and down in this Kingdom this kingdom is is a kingdom that never had a beginning so it will never have an ending it's an eternal Kingdom can the church say amen hallelujah so friends don't lose sight of the importance of why we are here this morning morning we are not here to build Church we're not here to have church there are many people going to church this morning and they will not be in the Kingdom good church members good Church Believers they love the Lord you know but they are not citizens of the Kingdom amen amen they are good church members friends the world is preparing for a funeral service and the foolish virgin is preparing for the tribulation but the wise virgin is preparing to step into that Kingdom the wise virgin is preparing for a Rapture the wise virgin is preparing for the wedding supper the wise virgin is preparing for the resurrection why are you speaking about the wise and foolish because Jesus himself said the kingdom is like unto 10 virgins come on now so as Jesus was speaking about the kingdom he was bringing Parables and examples so that in 2017 we will not be caught unawares and take for granted that because we are in the message we are all right take for granted because we believe God s a prophet it's going to be okay he said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto 10 virgins and five were wise and five were foolish they were all virgins they were all Sanctified they were all living good but some were wise and some were foolish they were all in church but some were wise and some were foolish they all believe God sent a prophet but some were wise and some were foolish they all believed in the Rapture but some were wise and some were foolish they all believed judgment was coming but some were wise and some were foolish they knew that God is real but some were wise and some were foolish they knew they were supposed to be in church but some were wise and some were foolish they were virgins they were pure but some were wise and some were foolish they all knew the message but some were wise and some were foolish they all believed it but some were wise and some were foolish the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto these 10 virgins this morning you must be able to answer for yourself if you are wise or if you are foolish it's not a subjective thing that's right on it's not left up to speculation what's wise and what's foolish the Bible makes it very clear the difference between the wise and the foolish the difference between the wise and the foolish was not in how many services they attended the difference between the wise and the foolish was not in who the pastor was the difference between the wise and the foolish was not how long they were in the message the difference between the wise and the foolish was that if they were jumping all service [Applause] nothing to do Hallelujah with that at all the difference between the wise and the foolish was nothing to do with conventions and rituals and ceremonies Hallelujah but there was a cry went out behold the bridegroom coming go out to meet him and those that were wise the Bible said had [Music] oil not just had oil but they had extra they had something more than just the [Applause] oil those that were foolish they understood the oil but they had no extra amen amen what brother brandom teach us he said oil signifies the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so the wise were interested in getting more of this holy ghost thing we can't afford to run out of this holy ghost thing we can't get enough of this Holy Ghost we cannot be satisfied with one touch we need a refilling and brother Bram taught us the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost a refilling of what was worked in a small measure but now it's greater it's more powerful it's all over me it's all inside of me it's can't afford to run out can't be satisfied with being a church member can be satisfied with just coming to church I need oil I need to Holy Ghost I need an experience I need to get a touch I need God to fill this vessel can't afford to run out because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand we got to go out to meet [Applause] him I pray that this will help you this morning in some way Hallelujah to get extra we need extra we need more so if you're used to praying a certain amount you got to pray more if you want more are you with me anybody who's into working out exercise know that after a while your body if you're used to doing 10 push-ups after a while the 10 push-ups has no effect on you because your body gets accustomed to doing 10 push-ups so if you get want to get more results you got to do more push-ups you got to do 15 and they got to do 20 why because your body will get adjusted and to get more results you have to put out more effort everybody with me you want to pass an exam you want to there are those who just want to pass you know just happy woo I pass what was he pass Mark if you just get 60 you pass I get 60 there are those that are happy with that but there are those who want to excel amen amen they don't want to just pass you see the problem with just passing is that it's one point between failure and success that's too close to comfort for me because if you mess up once it's 59 and you fail so I want to work to excel so I getting 72 78 81 so if I miss it I drop down to 69 70 there's no possibility of me failing this exam and there are many people in the message are living to be pass they want to get 60 they just want to do the minimum entry requirements to make this Rapture that's why some people ask what are the rules of the church what they need to do because they just want to Bear pass they don't want to make sure that they inter Raptor they just want to be you know there people for planes last goore last go you barely scrambling are you really want to fly paging George once page and you barely you now comeing you now reach the airport Hallelujah friends I want to check in early on this Raptor Express if there's anybody leaving first Lord let it be me I don't want to be a straggler I don't want to be the second ship if it's more than one ship this Raptor Express is ships I don't even want to be in the second ship I want to be in the first train out of this world can the church say Amen so no more barely making it barely overcoming you're struggling to have a prayer life you know why you're struggling because you're not making it important enough to have a prayer life because what you make important you find time to do that's right that's right oh can I get a witness in the house give us back the oldtime religion it's good enough for me it's good enough for you years ago people spend hours praying every day every day if we talk to God as much times as Facebook say people go on to Facebook you you you'll be [Music] Invincible brother R said we could sing too much we could shout too much we can never pray too much and prayer is that communication that relationship with God it's a relationship it's not thee thou thy thine it's not that it's that communication with God Lord I worship you Lord I love you Lord I woke up this morning and I had this little pain in my shoulder but I speak against it and I'm walking out to work to be an overcomer today and you talking you talking let people think you're crazy but you having a conversation with god because that's where your strength comes from that's where your encouragement comes from here do I walk to the Valley of the shadow of DEA fear or evil you walking down Fredick Street and you talking to your if you talking to the Lord there's an anointing around you there's an atmosphere around you what demon could break that barrier when you are covered by the blood and you are speaking and walking into your promises give us more Christians like that can the church say amen amen hallelujah in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy I'm taking my time this morning the pastor told me not to rush we do have a flight to catch this evening but we we going to we're going to do what the Lord wants us to do this morning because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen and the nearer we get to the kingdom of heaven then the rules of the Kingdom takes over the rules of this world so if this service is 5 hours that plane will have to wait because sons of the king need to be on that plane and the Pilot Air Force controller are subject to this Kingdom that that we represent it's a Kingdom of the most high that's why when the doctors give up on you we could overrule the doctor overruled when the bank says you can't get the loan we could overrule the bank when they say you can't buy the house we could overrule the real estate agent when you trying to get the best price God could overrule that price and give you your price because you are citizens of the kingdom and there are certain benefits you access to you are supposed to be happy you are supposed to be on fire you are supposed to have good success no weapon formed against you could Prosper these are the benefits of the Kingdom oh the joy of the Lord is your strength that's the benefit of the Kingdom I was young now I'm old I've never seen the righteous forsaken that's the benefit of the Kingdom healing is the the children's bread that's the benefit of the Kingdom it's to your children and your children's children that's the benefit of the Kingdom your daughter is going to be restored that's the benefit of the Kingdom your son is going to be delivered that's the benefit of the Kingdom your wife your husband your joy your peace will be restored that's the benefit of the Kingdom oh hallelujah oh we have benefits we have access to benefits this morning oh Hallelujah you may be seated depression is not my promise frustration is not my promise being fed up is not my promise being pushed around by the devil that's not my promise it's time we push the devil around it's time when we walk the devil and say I'm crossing the street because a son from the kingdom is walking Frederick's Street there are sons being activated their sons being activated Oh Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah oh you may be seated it has always been God's way to let his people know what's going to happen before it happens he doesn't let everybody know but he lets his people no are predestinated people are called out people are chosen people amen friends I want to kneel this down about the citizens of the Kingdom because the challenge is when we come to church on Sunday we put on our best Sunday face the best one the best Sunday clothes we get the best God bless you vernacular there are those who perfected God bless you there's the God bless you there's a God bless and we have these things locked down but the real thing about being a citizen of the kingdom and I spoke this in Nigeria and I spoke to the young people is what really happens what I call between Sundays [Music] [Applause] because right now everybody looking like the [Music] pass look at your neighbor they look like the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] past but you know brother brandom preached one time about that slave owner that had a conversation with somebody who was looking to buy slaves and he walked and he looked around and he didn't see anybody he wanted and then he saw one guy just was just different and he asked the slave owner is is that one for sale and the owner said no he's not for sale he asked the question does he sleep somewhere different he said no he sleeps where all the other slaves sleep does he eat something different no he eats the same thing that everybody else eat does he have a work schedule no he has the same work schedule as everybody else so what's different about it and that slave owner said I always wondered myself about this one because even though he was a slave and he is forced to work he always carried himself a certain way and I found out that way back in Africa where he came from his father is the king of the tribe and he has a prince despite his situation he walks like a prince talks like a prince acts like a prince lives like a prince whether he sleep on a bed or the floor he knows he's a prince whether he has a big house or a small house he knows he's a prince whether he has a car or he traveled to church he knows he's a prince whether he has money in his pocket or no money he knows he's a prince oh God help me this morning you may be seated so what I'm speaking about church it's not about your situation and job and stuff it's what you do in that job in that situation between Sundays oh we are pulling off the mask today we are pulling off the you know trinidadians if the Oscar is the Oscars if the Oscars was here we win everything in professional actors Denzel washing her KN to come and take notes young Brothers have it smooth and know oh young Brothers in the church think you're getting away because you could slip into school and to job and you don't need to have a testimony the sisters have it harder with you Brothers professional act act actors what it's a gift they're so good that they live in the world like in the world but when it come to church God bless you and then don't let me start on the sisters professional actors too you would never believe that they were in church Sunday when you see them on Monday between Sundays I wonder if I were to collect all the phones this morning and see all your text messages WhatsApp conversations direct messages what would I see if I were to take every phone [Applause] amen hallelujah if you were to walk into your lunchroom on your job and just sit there in the corner and hear you have conversations would I be shocked that you were in church on Sunday when you conduct yourself Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday waiting for the bus driving the car there's some Christians have road rage what is that road rage we are citizens of a kingdom amen and in that kingdom is a certain Behavior we have to have in that Kingdom and if you want to live in that Kingdom you need to display the behavior here before you can live over there in that Kingdom there's no oughts no grudges so if you still harboring and protecting and making sure you stack your o and grudges in order so you can remember them today is the day to drop it because that cannot pass the barrier between this world and that Kingdom young sisters there are certain clothes you could never wear in that Kingdom Hallelujah why would you have it here if it will never be over there there's certain music will never play in that Kingdom why are you feeding your spirit with it here if it will never be over there some of your friends who you call your friends will never make it to that Kingdom that's that's right Hallelujah you know the kind of friends I'm talking about those that influence you to do the things that you are not supposed to be doing instead of you putting pressure on them you're suffering from peer pressure what are you talking about you are a prince you are a princess you are a daughter of God you are a son of God Shake yourself and get back in step the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and you are citizens of that Kingdom can the church say amen I hope that helps somebody this morning friends we all have a conscience and brother random speaks about being sensitive to that still Small Voice that tells you no don't do something and brother Bram said it like this he said if you have a question in your heart about something don't do it protect yourself don't take chances we have too much gamblers in the message people taking a chance with their life taking a chance with their walk with God if there's a doubt or question in your heart the prophet said do not do it stay away from shading places it's okay to sit at your desk if everybody in the lunchroom is doing craziness it's okay because this world is temporary if you cannot influence them stay away from them that's it because if you don't have the strength to influence them they will influence [Applause] you let me say that again if you do not have the strength to influence them they will influence you Hallelujah praise God and you pray until you are strong enough pray until you are empowered enough to go after your loved ones don't go after your loved ones if you know you're not even living right how could you even influence them there has to be something in you that that has strength a Dynamo to push you because it's not flesh and blood it's principalities and powers and the devil knows you are different he can't figure it out all together but knows that you are different can the church say [Applause] Amen so we are not ignorant friends of what's coming we know how the story is going to end and we will not be surprised every backslider has to be restored I don't care what condition that they in because this bride has the power to speak like Jesus did to Lazarus and if Lazarus was dead and had to come forth what about our young people what about our children we will speak for them and see them come forth because the kingdom is a kingdom of power and the kingdom suffered violence and the viol and take it by force the devil has done too much in your house in your life it's time you pick up your sword pick up your Shield pick up your spear pick up your pruning hooks pick up your fork pick up whatever you have and say devil enough is enough I'm a citizen of the kingdom and I'm exercising my right for deliverance my right for my family my right can the church say Amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah my my my my my from the message the world is falling apart brother the B said friends we are not promised a system Jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we were promised what we promis a kingdom how do we get into it by one Spirit we are all baptized into this Kingdom it's the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal King giving forth his Eternal Word with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life he is the king we are baptized into it so friends if the Bible says here and the prophet is saying by one spirit we are all baptized into this Kingdom doesn't it behoove us to seek this baptism amen amen doesn't it behoove us to lay aside every weight that so easily beset us and set our hearts and saying Lord Place me into that Kingdom amen Lord baptize me into that Kingdom amen Lord I've been in church for a long time but I'm looking for for something more than just church is there anybody feels that way this morning Amen brother brandham goes on we are dead our lives are hidden God through Christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination Organization no we are resurrected in the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within you why all these madade systems Must Fall not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom amen and it subject is dead to the system of this world it's subject are dead to these organization it's dead to these political system and it's alive and resurrected by the power of the king amen and now we are in a kingdom sitting in Heavenly places with the Eternal King enjoying eternal life by the Eternal Word going to an eternal Heaven forever to be with him Hallelujah living in the presence of the king oh I love him I'm so glad to be one of them aren't you glad to be one of them I'm so glad to be dead in Christ alive in the kingdom of God this is not my home we seek a kingdom we seek a king we are already in the Kingdom we are seeking the king to come and the King quickly will come to his kingdom for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved all all these other things are falling apart America is falling apart Europe is falling apart Asia is falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom an eternal Kingdom it cannot be moved amen where Christmas is every day amen living in the presence of the king Glory don't have to guess about that it's the truth God's truth God's complete truth can the church say amen Amen brother random says in the message witness says someone said the other day brother Billy are you still preaching some of that new kind of religion you got I said no sir I'm preaching the oldest religion that ever was and the only one there really is that got salvation in it some of that new kind said we didn't have that here a few years ago I said let me tell you brother it's older than the world is that's right job said where was you when I laid the foundation of the world when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy millions of years before the foundation of the world Amen that's right witness my in that same message uh in message said the law and the prophets were until John since then it's the kingdom of heaven now tonight the holy spirit is in the church to fulfill what the New Testament said that will come to pass in this last days and this Kingdom suffered violence amen and every man has to press into it somebody say press press Every Man Has to press into it I cannot press for you the pastor cannot press for you the minister cannot press for you you have to press to get into that Kingdom I'm not going to be too much longer with you Hallelujah Hallelujah on December the 24th 1965 we know this brother Brandon went on to be with the Lord in a simple humble way unrecognized by the world the greatest Ministry outside of Christ had been walking the Earth amen similar to that of John the Baptist his purpose was to forerun the coming of Christ amen John's responsibility was to forun the first coming and brother brandham was to forun the second coming and the message has been the same from John to brother brandham it's the same message the kingdom of Heaven is at hand we know it we know about Abraham Moses Noah David Elijah but when be branam died his name would not be mentioned like Abraham and Moses but this great Elijah Prophet had unfolded the story of his life through three poles amen and it was a great purpose for this Prophet right to deliver a Seven Seals sth and the message Amen to prepare an elect Omega word bride Hallelujah for a Rapture yes sir and for a kingdom Hallelujah it was not to build a church it was not to build a denomination it was to prepare a people yes sir to leave this place because judgment was coming am Hallelujah and the Rapture was a temporary pulling away because judgment had to come to this Earth because our promise is we shall reign on the earth and the Bible said John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth because fire had to consume this Earth amen but the Bram spoke he said that's the reason today he said the devil is the prince of the power of the air he said there are demons everywhere demons in the atmosphere he said it'll take fire to destroy these demons he see when Noah was here it was water upon the earth when Jesus was here blood dripped on the earth water blood he said there's one more thing that's waiting and that's fire to consume this Earth to purify this Earth and to prepare this earth once more for royalty and brother brand said the same way that's done is the same way for the believer you are baptized ties in water then the blood sprinkled Over You by the wo Ministry of the word but there's another element despite the Revelation despite the preaching despite the word a supernatural element Still Remains there's a need for fire because the fire burns the snake out the fire burns the evil out the fire burns the lust of the eye lust of the flesh pride of life the fire takes out armor somebody the fire takes out the jealousy the fire takes out the Envy the fire takes out the cold stch [Applause] formal Holy Ghost Fire amen Holy Ghost Fire amen and when that fire comes upon you that fire comes to place you into position that fire comes to place you into the Kingdom so you are walking in time walking on the Earth but when the fire consumes you there's a shift that takes place you are no longer of this Dimension you are no longer of this time but you are a creature of Eternity walking in time you are a rule breaker you are a trend Setter you are just different you become like your bigger brother because we are had joint ears with Christ so it means Jesus is our bigger brother and if he could walk on water that means we could walk on water too if he could speak and say Lazarus come forth somebody in this church will speak and see the dead raised somebody in this church will speak and see a mountain move uh somebody in this church uh will speak and see the sick heal and see the cripples walk that's what I'm talking about the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand can the church say Amen somebody give God a shout of Praise oh I can't hear you somebody give God a shout of [Applause] Praise Hallelujah God always has an order and he will never break his order Peter walked with Jesus Peter walked on water and Peter still had to go into the upper room there was no bypassing the upper room there was no way around the upper room Peter still had to get his personal experience with the pillar of fire can the church say Amen is there anybody this morning once their personal experience with the pillar of fire not an experience with the pastor or the preacher but God himself self divided himself in the upper room and give each one their portion it was not just for the ministry but every individual got their portion Lord I want my portion do you want your portion this morning oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah hallelu I'm not going to be too much longer so we have been in a time of preparation for the kingdom of heaven because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and you can't just walk into it you need to be prepared for it and God has always had an order and he will never break his order the word of the lord always came to the prophets Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets kings were made subject to prophets the high priest had to subject himself to the prophets all the Levites had to subject themselves to the the prophet amen hallelujah and when the word of the Prophet came that word would stand until the next Prophet came along and we know what day we are in is this age to be any different according to my Bible there's no other major prophet to come there'll be no other Ministry like the ministry of brother brandham our Elijah our John the Baptist when brother Bram spoke it was not manp speaking when brother Bram spoke it was the son of man veiled in a son of man brother bam said in the lean Church it listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say Amen the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word amen it brings us back to the Bible amen and the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people not back to church but back to the word amen because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word amen back to the word means back to the Bible amen the Bible has always been a sealed book and without the message of this hour the Bible is close to you it's close to the Pentecostals they could have all kind of services but it's close to them that's why we thank God for a prophet who could point us that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen Hall friends I'm saying all of that to tie this message together that we are leaving this place amen and I'm troubling my Soul church because I don't see a lot of people making desperate preparation true to leave this place amen people are more concerned about preparing to live here brother brandham didn't say stop building houses and stop living He said live as if God is coming tomorrow hallelujah our goal should not be getting ready it should be staying ready I'll say that again our goal should not be getting ready it should be staying ready am there are some of us if God says I'm coming today some of you might have second thoughts because you know what you have planned tomorrow you're so caught up in the world of your plans your Ambitions your dreams your goals that you're not sensitive to the fact that this world is finished amen this world has nothing and we don't belong here can the church say Amen so I'm preaching to Overcomers this morning who are ready to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and overcome themselves and say Lord I want to surrender all because I want to be in that Kingdom I want to be a citizen of that Kingdom and brother Bram taught us that only perfect love will make it over there so it cannot be our interpretation our idea well this is me and my friend and we go in no it has to be as the word requires Hallelujah Friends The Rapture will be a defining moment you can begin to play something softly Hallelujah not going to be too much longer with you brother brandham said Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture amen I said this before in the Eternal Mind Of God as he looks at time time is divided into two categories before the Rapture and after the Rapture whether it's one person or a thousand people the message is the same get ready for the Rapture amen let us not lose the focus of why God send the prophet amen the purpose of this evening time message is to bring the bride into rapturing condition or into a condition to be in that Kingdom amen can the Church Say Amen not Church condition not message condition but rapturing Hallelujah condition and brother Brandon brought the type of the horse and buggy age and the airplane age and the astronaut age and he said that we Are Spiritual astronauts yes and we know that astronauts have to be prepared and trained because the air is different out there there's no gravity out there the way we have gravity here so you need to get prepped for it friends we need to start practicing now before we get over there amen friends we to live like citizens now yes before we get over there am and friends we have to be desperate now for the Holy Ghost we can't wait for another service we can't wait for tomorrow we have to be desperate right now and say Lord I need this am I need more I need extra I don't have enough Lord I'm empty David spoke of his cup running over that's what I want my cup running over hallelujah oh God help us hallelujah the Raptor is for individuals friends amen what good is it to come to church for all these years and miss the rapture [Music] you could have knowledge and miss the Rapture you could speak in tongues and miss the Rapture you could feed the poor and miss the [Music] Rapture friends don't miss the Rapture amen don't be among the foolish version in the message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him the prophet said I pray God that tonight if there be some here who doesn't know you who's never made their peace and maybe tonight while we have been speaking a little voice has been speaking down in their heart I feel a warning that I can be around much longer oh God may they put their house in order right now may everything be set May the coldness maybe they are Christians but if Liv under this so long and seen so many things that just lost the value of it the things they take it lightly instead of real deeply andely sincerely oh God let us check up tonight Grant it knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapturing church and if we are Laden with sin let's all stand to our feet with unbelief and with fullness we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you will burn into us the Holy Ghost down into our hearts amen oh God set our souls and fire with your blessing help us to understand every head bowed every eye [Music] closed Heavenly Father Lord the word has gone forth Lord and Lord there's a pull in the house father Lord we are a mixed audience father you said in every Church there are three kinds of Believers Lord I have faith to believe that there are real Believers in
