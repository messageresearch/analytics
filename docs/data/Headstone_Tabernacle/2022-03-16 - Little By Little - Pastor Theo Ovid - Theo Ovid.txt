supernatural strength we need in this hour granted fathers we approach your word mourn me your presence come upon it and take me out of the way and speak libtear to your people tonight in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you and if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to two portion scriptures exodus chapter 23 wondering from verse 20 to 30 and deuteronomy chapter 7 we're going to read from 17 to 26. reading from exodus chapter 23 verse 20. behold i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared the way of him will be his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thy enemies an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the hittites and the parasites the canaanites levites jebusites and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and he shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee they shall nothing cast their young nor be barren thy land the number of thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee i will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all and enemies turn their backs onto thee i will send hornets before thee we shall drive them out the hivites the canaanites to the hittites from before thee i will not drive them out from before thee in one year at least the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before they until they'll be increased and inherit the land deuteronomy chapter 7 reading from verse 17 to 26. if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them thou shalt not be afraid of them but shall well remember what the lord thy god did on the pharaoh and unto all egypt the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty and the stretched out arm wherein the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid moreover the lord i god will send hornet among them until they are left hide themselves from thee be destroyed thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and terrible and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once at least the beasts of the field increase upon thee but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed he shall deliver their kings into thine hand thou shalt destroy their name from unto him they shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them to give them images of their god shall you burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee at least that will be sneered therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god neither shall not bring an abomination into thy house at least there will be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is accustomed may god bless his word you may be seated praise god we are so glad to be here tonight praise be to jesus another title tonight little by little o praise the name of the lord little by little and i saw something somebody i saw something on uh somebody had sent and these were the words you're not going to master the rest of your life in one day relax master the day then keep doing that every day that is a powerful statement you're not going to master the rest of your life in one day relax just take a deep breath master the day then keep doing that every day so as you conquer every day you get the victory every day every day becomes important to you hallelujah little by little oh blessed be sin starts small always but it's still sin james 1 13 says let a man say when he's tempted i'm tempted of god for god cannot be tempted but evil neither attempt to be any man but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed and then when lust had conceived it brings forth sin and when sin is finished it brings forth death it starts as a thought that shoots across the mind the thought carries a desire and desire takes it down to a deed and a deed comes a habit and a habit forms a character thought desires deed habit character and that character takes you to your destiny no small hill for small sin and big l for big sin sin is sin big or small just like a bush fire starts with a little spark but it starts from some point just a little thing it always starts a little little sins lead to bigger ones small error leads to big errors a little off the path and you continue so far so long time later on your financial way off at the beginning it looks near like it you know if you had to go north east and you just got a va a little bit you find yourself not somewhere but not where you're supposed to go it always is small in its infancy like the prophet talked about the philistine baby who has a nice baby but that could be um i'll come a big man and kill him kill it a murderer don't start off being a murderer start off being a liar competitive big teeth and then getting some kind of young thing and afterwards they kill it wasn't intentional i will become a murderer no it started somewhere praise the lord amen joshua seven and he brought his soul man by man this is after joshua was trying to check out why things are going right why things going off beat because god tell him every place you put your foot is yours no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life i lives 40 and everything and all of a sudden men started get die and all kinds of things like that so you won't know what's going on what is this he called a halt try by tribe family by the family then man by man so you couldn't hide any tribes coming to the family and it's not a family it's one by one man my man and he brought his household man by man and aiken the son of kami the son of zabdi the son of zerah the tribe of judah was taken joshua said unto ake and my son give i pray thee glory to god of israel and make confession unto him tell me now what that was done is not from me and he could answer joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus on this have i done when i saw his eyes at work now when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonious garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold and 50 shekels weight i coveted him that's in his heart now that is the desire you see with his eyes he thought hit him and his desire activated he started covered down all right he said i covered them and took them he cannot know behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so joshua sent messengers and they ran into the tent and behold it was hidden this tent and silva under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them to joshua and unto all the children of israel laid them out before the lord and joshua and all israel with him took ikan the son of sira and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold his sons his daughters his ox his asses his sheep his tent all he had they brought them unto the valley of eco and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble you this day and all israel stole them with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from his fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of echo unto this day just like that the instruction was don't touch the goal don't touch what they have don't fear leave it to bring it to the house leave the business alone i detest it hate it because i'm going before you hallelujah now remember they didn't give themselves that promise god give them the promise i will bring you onto this land he said the land is already occupied they knew up front it wasn't land that was empty with grass and and desert no the land of hittites and jebusites the land is already occupied but don't worry with that don't worry who's the occupants of that land i'm going to fight for you i'm going to in front go in front of you you wouldn't possess it in one year little by little oh glory to god you wouldn't get where you want to go immediately but little by little you have to manage little you have to understand what little is praise god if you're praying every day that's a little bit little every minute little by little oh praise god you're putting some deposit in little by little you're looking for no get rich quick business listen by little you could save and get where you want to go little by little give the lord some praises hallelujah give the lord some shouts luke 16 10 to 12 jesus speaking he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful and also in much and here is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous man who will commit you unto trust you to riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man who shall give you which is your own the amplified he who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful in much so before god load you up god have to see if he could manage the little that he give you and based upon your diligence application fervency dedication he could give you much because you know the same principle that you applied in managing little you will use this in principle in applying that which is much so god wouldn't have no horrors given you much when you see you could effectively manage little or give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah so when you are strong to manage the little that you have god will give you more to manage or could we give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god you ready for the word this morning tonight hallelujah praise god some people can manage ten dollars they want a thousand dollars they want a hundred thousand dollars you can't manage what you have why god should give you more you will chew on yourself they will destroy yourself oh glory to god god want people he could trust glory to god and before i give you much to give you a little deceiver be faithful and literal oh glory to god because you know if you're faithful and literal you'll be faithful in much glory to god because there's an approach to god little by little he told them that that is how they're going to conquer the land so you don't have to get frustrated you don't have to get fed up you don't have to give up because if they're working out as they expected you could take a deep breath and say the lord is on my side oh god the land is my lamb it's a good land it's fluid milk and honey oh god my family will be delivered oh glory to god my son will be delivered but total will be delivered my husband will be delivered my wife will be delivered little by little i could possess this land i will change my approach tonight i will change my thinking tonight i wouldn't break out in frustration and break out in depression and break out in anger because it's not working as fast as i want it to work god have his own timing okay let's right now prophet now and here at the king islania where they come to the judgment seat that is where they feel because the biggest percentage of these men who came back and said why we look like grasshoppers up the side of them see they were looking at symptoms joshua and caleb was looking at what god said now if aircon was believing what god said he never touched that garment but he was looking for himself he was looking to see how he could profit at his side and that lust that covetousness that desire inside of him the thought coming on her but he could not he could have crushed the thought thoughts has come bursas bring thoughts to us to do this and also do that but you have to deal with them thoughts them tortures legitimate thoughts is legal thoughts praise god satan have a right to bring them thoughts you don't have to hold it praise god you have to leave our birdness and tap your head for him to sit down on your head and bang you with tedder thoughts you could say get behind me satan you could shake it off thoughts will come towards the sin towards the backside it's lifted by little devils tore people off they don't instantly backslide in church they gradually fall away at home they'll get smashed up just like that oh glory to god the wife answer back a husband oh glory to god the husband stopped loving his wife issues start to happen it doesn't just brush up just like that oh glory to god little by little the devil is a smart man oh glory to god and god is a wise man what give the lord a shout and if we have to get back to where we have to be we have to possess it little by little and every little take you have to conquer it every later you take you have to manage it and as you conquer you get more to conquer or give the lord a shout oh hallelujah so let the prophet interpret the scriptures that we just read i will drive them out and i will do this let him interpret how that is going to be done all right let's go watch this he said what and finally when god to get away from the church age raise up another man called joshua and went into the promise and they fought donde every philistine now look here we go listen it god said i am not going to give it to you all at one time if i give it to you at one time the whole land will be swept beer then the wild beast will multiply against you and will overcome you i'm just going to give it to you little by little are you ready as you are able to possess the land i'm going to drive them out and give it to you little by little so as as you are able you're going to drive them that's the way god does tonight maybe you say well i do feel a little bit better praise god we will take some we gotta kill the knights today we'll take the amorites tomorrow then see just as you're able to take it you might break your neck if you got all at once you see so god just give it to you just as you are able to fight it out so god had given you no mountain if you can't even handle the flat flat grass valley you have there why you should give your mountain for well they could fight that out god gave more land then god gave a little hill then god gave you a mountain use our caleb approach he said something except coming again hell is monk hebron you know it was no flat you know why you think your experience must be a flat one so god gave it to you just as you are able to fight it out or you say i couldn't move my hand only that much yesterday but i can move it much more today praise the lord tomorrow i'll move it that much you see just little by little i will tell you one of the most marvelous thing i've ever seen in my life is the greatest hours of my life is when i get up against a wall that i can't get over it under it or wrong it and then i trust god and he opens the way and i go to the thing and god takes you through that and when you come out on the other side it's like samson when he killed the lion when he got on the other side when he killed the land he got the sweetest honey he ever eat under that old carcass of the lion and sometimes if you'll overcome something by the grace of god it's been one of the sweetest things that you ever tasted in your life if your spirit spiritually know what i'm talking about oh glory to god hallelujah praise god i will not drive them out all in one year unless the beasts of the field modify against you and come against you but little by little will i drive them out as you are able to possess the land i will drag them out so if god only know you're right here he can drive up no more you have to possess this you could judge his how you gonna possess this you'll try the more they will possess this oh glory to drag them out given your glory to god what that song like it's not like if it only gets started god will do the rest go give the lord that praise that's the promise you know if you can only get started if the bride could only get started glory to god he's not the one the pastor driving him up for you if you drive them out it's your land it's our land we all are fighting tonight glory to god the pastor can fight alone you can't sit down looking for some priest

them people with the prayer cards up here and pray for them and anyone meeting any other thing i was just praying for the sick but before we pray for the sick we have got to get the people in the attitude it's the attitude that always brings the results always the attitude is the attitude that you take towards god here's a woman touch his garment she was healed with a blood issue a soldier spit in his face and was and the crown of torns on his head and felt no virtue it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are

getting started start reviving your house and bring the revival to the church or give the lord a shout in the house if you can get started go do the rest praise god praise god praise god right on to the end of the road god will be faithful he said you quit your doubting give over give up let god he said i will not give you the land in one year if i will give you the whole thing in one year the wild beast will come and consume you but little by little as you are able i will give you the land so if god see you not able you give your abc why you should give your algebra you ain't set fast in the abc you're not passing away supposed to pass why are you supposed to give you more and you're asking go for more you know god give him more give me more but god you are looking to see when you would behave yourself man you know he could do what bradley is done the tongue is troubling you know man want to control other men but they can't control himself mark the perfect man that's very hard you have tomorrow because tung loose people said no lit from a mouth you better get a little remote and a padlock too sometimes i just have to shut up some some some wives cash shut up at all they go and go and go and go until they come like a nag on the husband some of them don't know the handle and the next the next story all together we're here for that we he said little by little hear this but just as you kill all this bunch of amorites i'll let you move in and take over little by little do you hear the explanation for that he said if you kill out this bunch of have ice i'll let you move in and take over if you kill me what happening if you kill them i'll give you more as you kill anymore as you take over you're getting more if you don't want more just stand still don't even put your foot good stand still i guess what if it stands to the little your heart will be taken from you gonna finish them will take you out you have to fight to live oh glory to god hallelujah somebody said i was prayed for last night i had a crippled hand and the only thing i could do is wiggle my finger he said that's just as further you spread out brother you swear that further you'll move your arm you you spread out your faith god will let you take over your territory it is yours god promised you your health again is i feel good oh god spread me out israel's had started but that failed and god's mercy is grace had kept holding for them holding for them then he come to kinishbani and moses choose one man out of each tribe sent 12 men to spy out the land and when they got there what are two more was among them here they come back why we couldn't why the american isaac unites in the night parasites all kinds wall cities some of them were so large these people we look like grasshoppers to them isn't that just the time of the church today we can't do it i tell you it's impossible uh we have become this week we have this that where's the street meetings anymore a bad answer is not very much that's true he said watch so sin is so enticing it's grammar it's very appetizing appeals sin has it's so innocent so we can't just take for granted people saying she's boiling even hallelujah with nice tie knight dress long just covered their knee and they here have no thing in it and the if anything nice nice christians that time you sit down working overtime knocking you ticking you off you know like somebody spying on you watching every move where you going and the time and everything else and he busy and diligent checking you it's all right he used to he's a pretty one i wanna know he pray in ten minutes it's all right he's going down good job somebody someone with witchcraft and they don't want to just got some spell but they couldn't because they preached every time they go to do their business because they preach and pray they're trying to mash up the church and every time these force come they see any man in prayer and they had to go back because you have to feed your soul you know so if you're not in the world you're not any rallying inmates or anything like that they're so being fed your feelings have news information youtube um facebook um all them little the things that stand around and forward all them forwards that cover everything under there so i didn't open some of them things don't touch them anything i don't know time it's forward and thing people feel it's is realizing forward i'll give you that time spread forward let the word forward watch watch sinister enticing it's glamour it's got very appetizing appeals and has it's so innocent watch it looks so innocent don't you listen to it after a while joshua took the land god told him utterly destroy everything there is don't leave nothing why could you imagine some of them israelis woman picking up a little baby isn't it cute even got teeth yet joshua said kill it the mother said my mother i can't kill that baby he said you must hand it here he said look cute now but it will grow up and be just like his daddy you can't baby sin it's got to be handled not with gloves but bare-handed we want to be nice everybody what is nice we want to be humble what is humility we want to be full of compassion what is compassion jesus a man of compassion passed through two or three thousand people water head babies crippled blind hold whither he had compassion what did he do what over there the father showed him a man that maybe had prostrate trouble or something and healed him and walk away i'll leave the rest of them a man full of compassion the world doesn't use compassion it's got to be obed so you see some point in time you have got to get your feelings out of it and recognize the word is to be obeyed how would you think could destroy babies and innocent women and things like that so called 111 is the whole lump that's the same thing started back there oh my he said watch don't presume believe don't reason knowledge has reasoning faith has no reasoning faith just holds on to it oh blessed be the name of the lord he said what the promise is mine sure but you'll fight every inch till you get well you will take every step of it it's a battle the promise is yours that was the promised land that the fight to get every step of it the promise is yours but you will fight for every inch he said so many says if the lord is a familiar coat if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from line or stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you you've got something to do they'll overcome shall inherit all things they'll overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready i like that word you see god couldn't push us through a little pipe pull us on the other end and say blessed he didn't overcome it you didn't overcome he just pushed you through so you can't expect so late longer this message you expect go for a push give me push lord push bible say that you know they say the kingdom is preaching every man press their way into it press is not somebody pushing for me hanging this you want to pray you had never had the press present to what the kingdom the kingdom oh glory to god church is easy anybody could go to a church join a fellowship i like my group i like my pastor i like my church right that's fine that's not the kingdom kingdom different but the kingdom you have up on your knees your mother turned on a few meals and fast a little bit kingdom thing hallelujah gotta shake off yourself kingdom business hallelujah the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who finds a treasure hid in the field hallelujah oh god a smart man he hit the treasure and then sell all that he had and he buy the whole field nobody knew the church inside of you like when you focus he can't take what is not his own it's in the field he find it in the field it's not his own you know but he trashes in the field the people who own the field don't know that treasure is there when he see that treasure there he buy the whole field he sell everything here it doesn't matter what the price was he willing to pay the price to buy the whole field no the feelings might not get the treasure oh give the lord a shout it just goes to show the sacrifice that you're willing to pay for this great treasure hallelujah glory to god thank you lord thank you alone my god my god hallelujah the promise is yours but you have to fight for every inch musicians come on please the devil will see read this again no matter what happens believe it anyhow that's the way the rest of them had to believe it we are not excluded from that we are not excluded from that god gave palestine to israel but they had to fight for every inch of wrong they got the promise is yours but you have to fight every inch you claim the devil will see to that so you see they're not among champions that's called small champions people people they see many things right and they claim and they send him this is not that because the devil let her back you up you say that yours and he go in with you you want to be serious look at jacob when jacob wanted change and jacob didn't know exactly what he was going to encounter bubba said he was confounded alone and you know the story he was wrestled by the angel and after a while he he was you see jacob wasn't studying the angel you know he was studying he needed change that was the building up if he said he really didn't go yeah you know them them kind of google people who kind of caught up but he was so caught up and changed he just had to go now he said yeah i ain't changing i feel in presence i feel in power but i ain't changing did you change the community inside he said let me go he said i will not let you go tickle the bless me no see that what he tells us that hear your words though i will not let you go then we fight no start days after midnight you know it's all night long and it's midnight coming up if you see if you're serious and you're tired oh gosh but i could do some coffee now let go of the angel and go on your mistake you know enjoy you want change now you could drink coffee how much you want after but this is the angel changing time now i will not let you go till you bless me it's not the break there he said your day time your cat you said bless me jacob put down such a lock neck on that angel inside of the touch when he touched over your muscle you get touched he was walking the front walking with your lymph now he wasn't walking normal even he brought up a view of him they say mash up boy you can make you get my shirt oh glory god finish me you must work everybody will do something happen to you because your work will be different come on you're not the same you something happened oh glory to god i'm finished [Music] listen to this question why didn't god go over there and just run out all the amorous parasites all of them i'm still reading why didn't just run them all out no israel had something to do and you have got something to do god said the land is yours go and possess it go and possess it it is yours they have to fight every inch of their way but it was assured that it would be given to them no matter what the results what the circumstances look like it was tears god gave it to them they looked at the promise instead of the of the circumstance healing is yours but i'm fleshing it out now salvation is yours the holy spirit is yours then he said the real holy spirit is yours if god calls you he intends for you to have it that you may not strongly i wonder if they say amen outside of there if god calls you he intends for you to have it but you have got to fight every inch of the way to get it you certainly will look it come to our place friends the way this world is so awful is going to make you prove every inch of ground you stand on satan is going to do it it's coming to a time where impersonation and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised from the real true body of christ he's going to have a body that's pure holy filled with his spirit walking in his spirit and doing the works that he did be faithful to that hallelujah he will never come down watch he said footprints mean possession minister and brethren don't be afraid to put your footprints where god told you to go it's possession he told joshua everywhere you place the stool over your feet it's yours we won't back up we take what god said that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems how difficult it seems if god said so it is yours and when he gave it to joshua he never said i'll take all the device and fill his hands and give it to you joshua had to fight for every inch of ground but god was with him and every inch of ground you will cover brother to make footprints you fight your way through and take the sword of the spirit brother and move right on he is a marvelous shepherd let him feed you he would feed you on his word the holy spirit lives by the word and every promise in the book of the great shepherd is to his sheep but brother he will never come down and drive it away from you you've got to fight every inch of that promise it is yours it belongs to you i'm almost done here joshua fought every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other one but he had a promise god said i'll give it to you where there was giants whether there's atheists whether it's infidels whether it's called formal churches what difference does it make god give the promise let's take it it is ours it belongs to us abraham praise god in other words i applied to the church today because say lord god here's my brother he is laying there stricken with cancer he is tricking tuberculosis he's got i lay hold of the promise it's my possession you told me so there you are and when you go after that enemy that devil that slaughter is just the same as abraham slaughtering the kings and brought back that possession yet abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his and yet he had a right to possess it and the believer today we are heir to all things yet we are heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it and that's the way god got it set up he set it up that way oh glory to god it always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do now the promise is yours if you ever get it if you ever get it it ain't going to be easy i'm going to tell you you're going to have to take away from satan satan captures your health you got to write this quote and satan said give it back hand it over i come in the name of the lord jesus the possession of heaven root i'm at his heir give it back you took my child you got to mix up with the wrong boy you took my boy you have a mix up with the wrong girl i clean them i clean my children i clean my brother i clean my sister
