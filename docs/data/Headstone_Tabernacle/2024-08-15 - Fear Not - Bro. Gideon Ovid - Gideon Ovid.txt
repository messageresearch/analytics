strengthen the feeble knees tonight Lord Lord I pray that your presence will fill the whole house that you will pour out your spirit upon your people in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you love him tonight thank you Jesus what a blessing it is is to be here once again and I'd like to invite you to turn with me to one Short scripture I want to take my time and ensure everybody gets it everybody finds it I wouldn't be too long at all I believe that God has something special in store for us tonight amen So reading from the book of second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7 would you find it say Amen all right and it says for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen you believe that so he didn't call us to be shaken he didn't call us to be on the defensive but he called us to be on the offensive he called us to be strong and bold and brave not to be shaken under the task Mas under what the enemy has to throw at us but he's called us to not have fear to not cow to not bow down but to be raised up in such a time as this amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats for a title it's fair not and for a subject perfect love cast out Fair amen perfect love casts out fear the titled fear not because we are called in this time as mighty Gentile Warriors but just before just to clarify and to make the distinction you know the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but that's not the fear we talking about tonight tonight we want to look at the spirit of fear that sometimes seems to bind us that keep us in in a in a state of Doubt where we're not sure who we are or what's promised to us and our ability to access that you see once you get to know who you are and what promises are left for you you could operate with a level of confidence you could operate with a level of boldness knowing that you could accomplish whatsoever is set out in front of you amen so in this end time I want to say whenever God is fixing to do something miraculous He commands that you have no fear he would say things like be bold be strong be courageous fear not amen he always command that you have no fear when he's about to do something cuz he doesn't like to work with weaklings he doesn't like to work with people that are shaky on the inside I did a little research about fair and they say fair although it may start mental has physical manifestations so people often express I feel afraid I feel fearful I have fear but rarely it has physical manifestation to say when you are afraid or frightful or experience fear there's a little feedback on the platform when you experience that they say your heart rate goes up they say your heart starts to beat faster scientifically it said or medically blood moves away from your hearts and towards your limbs so it puts you in what they call a fight or flight attitude so yes it could work well if your your your your challenge and let's say you're being chased by a dog or or or some some scenario that you need to get away quickly that feir may be seen as something good but guess what I also saw that when you are overcome with fear it stresses you out and that stress could be detrimental because it causes you to be double-minded double minded and we know a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways God doesn't want us to be like that so he often would say fear not it is I fear not amen before giving out his commands Amen in addition to saying fair not he also gives a sense of assurance so he doesn't just leave fair not don't be afraid so he just imagine for instance if you are afraid of dogs and you see a dog coming the Natural Instinct it's innate for you to to be afraid so if I were to say don't fear those are words but if I say don't be afraid afid because here I have a whip and if any dog come so I put a provision to protect you so you're now in a position to enforce the command to fair not amen so in this case we've seen through scripture that God has not just challenge us to to put away faar but he has also enforced it by putting Provisions in place for us to be all right I want you at the same time to remember that that this here is not a drill this is not a recruitment exercise God is not now looking for soldiers he recruited before the foundation of the world so right now you're in the training ground because this is not a simulation this is not a drill this is reality and he has prepared you for such a time as this in this battle we're fighting a real enemy you're not fighting me you're not fighting flesh and blood so you need to be prepared and to be victorious in this battle you have to Cast Away faar you have to throw that aside you have to G up your loins you have to answer like a man you have to to put your chest back put your shoulders back and be Brave and Bold like David and say I'll cut your head off I will cut your head off because God has made a promise to you and nothing is going to stop it from coming to pass nothing is going to stop it from becoming manifest in your life and it doesn't apply to your parents and not you it applies to the old to the young to the children it doesn't matter who you are where you are how long you're in church how long you're in the message how much spoken word books you read you're still called to fight in this battle you're still called to possess your inheritance that's left for you the reason we train is because in this battle we have all sorts of distractions we have all sorts of things trying to pull us this way and pull us that way but we've been trained to to hear a certain sound we've been trained to hear that sound they say if you don't know that sound how could you prepare for the battle how would you be prepared you hear a horn over there and you you don't know if it's an ice cream truck or you don't know if it's time to to put on your boots to G up your loins to have your staff in your hand to have your sandals on your feet Amen Let Let me just switch for a second and and in the Book of Joshua 1 and and and and and we're familiar with it this is after Moses now and God actually commands Joshua to operate without fear right and of course we know he was Moses Minister and in in verse 5 of Joshua 1 it says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear upon their fathers to give them so all that there highlights the promise that's not the command yet that that's just the promise he said listen here what this is my mission for you that I have committed and I have promised this and my promise will never fail will never fall it shall always accomplish amen so it goes on he said in verse 7 only be thou strong and and very courageous so it have have some some some contingencies here only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest the book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shal meditate therein day and night and thou May Subs deserve to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shal have good success so there is a few verses highlighting this is the promise here this is the goal this is exactly what's going to happen if you could hold on to the contingencies that I I I I have outlined and in verse n listen to this one he says have not I commanded thee be strong and and of a good courage be Not Afraid neither be thou dismayed so I don't want you D and out I don't want you to flake on me I want you to stand tall I want you to be steadfast single eyed and focused knowing this is the goal we set out the objectives we've laid it out for you and I expect you to see it through till the end he said be thou dismayed neither be thou dismayed listen listen this is the provision here for the Lord thy God is with thee so this is not just be not not afraid he said because I am with thee the Lord is with thee withersoever thou goest so if you go to the left or to the right if you go into battle he promised that he'll be there he said he'll never leave you nor forsake you but he will be even in you to the end of the age but you have to to look at the contingencies one of the things he say fair not go boldly because this is the promise he highlighted before amen now it's interesting to note in Joshua 7 now they would have gone on and in the story of Joshua the promise was listen no man shall stand before thee this is a 100% success rate nobody nobody nobody nobody in Joshua 7 this is the scenario with Aon it says in verse one but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accured thing for aen the son of Kami son of Z zabdi son of Zarah in the tribe of Judah took the ACC cursing and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel you see that now God's promise doesn't negate his judgment that's good no matter what he promised you it doesn't mean that you're immune and you can do as you please because there are contingencies he said stay don't go to the left or to the right meditate on my word operate this particular way why because I will be with thee and you know what your success is guaranteed have no fear that's he command have no fear and you'll be successful if you could do these things now listen hallu in verse five Hallelujah and the men of I SM of them about 30 and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shearim and SME them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water you know what that said there it says listen that's licks like fire no you're going and they're chasing and they're running like dogs no now does that sound like success to you no no no no no no no no no no no no no imagine God promised that no man should stand before thee and your men being routed before you even reach the enemy's gate that is the power of sin that is the power of Disobedience that is the power of staying from what he set forward as his contingencies but there is a chapter 8 and in chapter 8 this is after it was cleaned out after Aon was ston and removed it says and the Lord said unto Joshua listen now fear not neither be thou dismayed this is for the second time take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to I see I have given into thy hand the king of I and his people and his City and his land and thou shalt do to I and her King as thou did unto Jericho and her King only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall he take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush your city behind it so Victory again success again once you could apply his contingencies he say listen fear not I don't want you be down and out be not dismayed don't worry about the past don't worry about what happened last night don't worry about what happened yesterday today I want you to stand stand tall stand bold be brave because my promise will never fail and he chose you before the foundation of the world Amen switching quickly to Gideon in the Book of Judges chapter 12 sorry chapter 6 and verse 12 I want you to know that fear not just paralyzes your faith but it's used as a filter Hallelujah God don't like it he don't want it he don't even want chain his army if you're afraid you know what he says if you're afraid stay home stay home because on the battlefield we want Warriors we want trained men we want people who could say we're more than able to conquer amen so in Judges chapter 6 and verse 12 and it says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and we know the story and Gideon said unto them oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then has all this befallen us adversity has fallen and where be all his miracles which our father told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt so this is after Moses now but now the Lord had forsaken us and has delivered us into the hand of the midianites and the Lord looks upon him this is verse 4 now and says go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least of my father's house and the Lord said unto him listen provision now surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and down to verse 22 it says and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon says alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him in verse 23 peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die so I am giving you a command you're going to Smite the midianites as one man but you can't go in there with fear as a matter of fact in chapter 7 and verse two it says and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to the median ites into your hands lest Israel vaun themselves against me saying my hand had saved me so he don't even want to take the glory he don't want to say well because I train and I'm a mercenary and God show me this is his provided way he don't even want you take the glory he says listen in verse three now therefore go to proclaim the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early from Mount G gilled and there return the people 20 and 2,000 and there remain 10,000 so what does that say 2/3 of them went back filtered out because they afraid he said listen if you're even afraid if you have doubt if you're not sure there's not a battle for you take it at home not not not reality amen that's just the way he is he not into the fearful frighting and I don't know you know I seen Goliad there and depending on the angle but I'm not sure if you could take him today and know perhaps when it get dark no no no no no when David saw him he said listen who is this uncircumcised Philistine challenging the army of the Lord amen bold Brave without fear so he could be used by God to accomplish his promise amen my Lord there there's a message brother Brandon preached the way to have fellowship and in this message paragraph 26 he says that's the trouble with man tonight that's what's the trouble with people tonight you're scared that's the biggest curse there is on Full Gospel people or any other people it's because they are afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his his word for it so the promise is there but you don't have enough faith it wasn't mixed with faith so you could go and possess the land yeah you kind of I kind of I remember he say that to know but I'm not sure he says if you wasn't afraid tonight you would take your healing by faith and know that God promise it and the thing would just go Plum away from you afraid scared of notice it that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can't get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fair which has no value in it at all Fai is of god fear is of the devil fear makes you wear Fair makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do to me to get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end in the morning tomorrow morning what good would it do for me to worry about it well you say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon sure there's a value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love casts out all fear wish I had time to tell you the experience of Wildlife and and he went on to to tell the story of the bullu amen I just kind of skipped down a little bit and he says you know this bull had killed a CED man on a farm and and in in paragraph 28 he said and then when I started across the field right in a big open field not over about 30 yards from me this big fellow raised up and threw his horns down let out a big Bellow if you know what I'm talking about that killer bull was ready was ready and waiting was all primed up you know what he said he said it scared me at first at first it scared me this is brother Brandon right jumping the fence and going and he said the bull scared him he said I looked for a tree and there wasn't any tree I knew he could outrun me to Def fence so I thought well this is it so then something happened hallelujah oh God if that would only stay there instead of going away something happened I wish God would let it happen to everybody here tonight under the sound of my voice just long enough to get healed see something happened that I wasn't scared of the bull I felt sorry because I Disturbed him I was in his feet he was laying out there not bothering me I came along and woke him up and so I felt sorry for him now you can't Bluff itff it it has to be there that's the way faith is you can't Bluff you got to really have it it's an action thing you got to see it in motion you can't pretend and make it up you really have to have it the devil will know it and this fellow started to Ward me with his head down just as hard as he could I wasn't no more afraid that that's the prophet's words I wasn't no more afraid of that bull then I would be of my dear brother and sister standing on this platform and he run within about 5T of me and he stopped he looked at me so depleted he looked right and left I said fellow I'm sorry I Disturbed you I said now you're God's creature and I'm God's servant now the Creator that made you made me and I'm his servant I'm on my journey across the hill to pray for one of his sick children if I know you'd been laying there I wouldn't have come by and Disturbed you so now in the name of Jesus Christ the Creator go back and lay down this is the boldness this is the I mean this is the confidence of which I speak this is what God is seeking you say at the judgment bar you see it BR brought into light that bull looked at me for a few minutes turned around walked over and laid down and as I stood there the tears running down my cheeks I walked within 5T of that bull and he never even turned his head and looked at me why instead of hating him I loved him Love Will Conquer anything right that's what conquered my heart when I know that God so loved me that he gave his only begotten son that I wouldn't have to perish know that I was born in this world a sinner and I was perishing and God loved me that he give his son for my life to be redeemed amen you believe that tonight I couldn't hate no more I had to love that's what brings the result you see it's love you see that that that assurance that Assurance is what in Psalm 27 David said in verse one he said the Lord is my light and my salvation he wasn't writing poetry he wasn't making it up because it song good and it rhyming this was his testimony the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the weak the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat of My Flesh they stumble and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart heart shall not fear this's the same guy God said is a man after my own heart a man that's bold that can cast Fair aside and trust in God he say in this will I be confident verse four one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple and I said he leaves a provision when you have no fear there's a provision or a hedge protect you in verse 5 it says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion it didn't say trouble wouldn't come but in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and in verse six he says and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore I will offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord you see why we praise and why we worship he sent ambushments to protect you I I had Psalms 121 and brother Anthony read it tonight amen so I want to switch over quickly to Elijah and and it's interesting as we know the scripture that God says he commanded a widow woman to sustain him amen yet when Elijah said bake me a cake first as we say she gave excuses now God commanded her amen and she gave excuses but listen listen in First Kings chapter 17 and verse 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zerath which belongs to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee which is to keep thee that's not to feed you that's to ensure that you're okay that's what sustenance is in verse 10 so he arose and went to zarapas and when he came to the gates of the city Behold a widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her he said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and and as as we say while you're doing that as you're there bring and in in in in in verse 11 he says and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a muscle of bread in thy hand so in so far as you're bringing the the water bring the morle one time in verse 12 and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a crew CR and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her watch his words fear not go and do as thou said so be Not Afraid don't doubt have faith and continue doing what you said you're going to do amen but make me therefore thereof a little cake first and bring it on to me and after make for thee and for thy son in verse 14 this is the provision now for thus said the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day of the that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth amen so time after time in verse 15 and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah we seeing time and time again if you could observe what God has promised and have enough faith and cast out Doubt cast out fear be bold and courageous and apply the word of God to your life nothing could stand before you all the days of your life he is more than able to sustain you to bring you through to bring you out amen now at times we we we wonder and we we try to figure things out and we wonder why this had to happen this way and we can't explain and it was interesting in a message Be Be not Afraid brother Brandon was talking about about Lazar us and one of the things he said in that that message Be not Afraid paragraph 21 you say now you say that's not scriptural brother brandom yes it is now wait a minute Jesus was living with Martha and Mary and Lazarus he's living around them you knew each other well they were good friends you remember that and the father said to his son I want to use you believe God was in Christ certainly he was all right father wants to use his gift on Earth nobody wants to volunteer to get sick nobody want to volunteer to die but there are times when God has to do things to manifest his power and his ability on Earth for us to see you say he want to use his gift on Earth so he tells Jesus go away from the home because and this is a private discussion between God and Jesus now go away from the home because Lazarus is going to die so Jesus knew that before he says be gone for 4 days after 4 days he'll be dead dead Lazarus will be dead then you return so these are the instructions so we getting a glimpse behind the scenes here he say after four days he'll be dead then you return and go back and raise him from the dead that never said said no virtue left that went on over in four days they sent to him come pray for Lazarus he's dying he just kept on going sent another messenger come pray for Lazarus the one you love he's dying just kept going then after another time he said Lazarus sleepeth oh he said if he sleep he does well he said he's dead and for for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there because they've been trying to get him to do something that was against the will of God so the prophet is saying had he come back early he would have interrupted the will of God for lazarus's life so it had to happen this way had Lazarus not died the scripture wouldn't be the way it is today amen so you don't have to figure it out yourself you don't have to wonder once God is in it he's got it under control he'll never leave you nor forsake you he knows the end before the beginning so we just need to trust and Obey and have faith in his unfailing undying word that he who Creator the promise is able to fulfill it with or without you he don't need your your opinion he don't need your your your your insertion your advice switching quickly along here in a message then Jesus came and called This is referring to to Peter walking on the water after the miracle of the Five Loaves and two fish so imagine coming off of this High figuring out that we had so much left over it was a miracle they're excited Jesus left them and he went to pray and he told them go ahead go on a boat relax take it easy and the Bible said the winds were contrary so they were on the Water by themselves and Jesus is praying just to paint a picture for you and at that time paragraph 157 he says one time the disciples were out on the boats all hopes were gone the storms they went away without Jesus and the storms was just just like it was at Lazarus house all hope was gone the little old boat had water logged and this is this is the dramatization here now the little boat had water log and there was screaming and crying and maybe praying going on and lightning flashing and the boat filled up with water and mass poles dropped down the OES broke and they were holding one another crying and in the real darkness of hour then Jesus came walking along but he looked like a shadow to them he looked scary like a spirit and they cried out with fear that's what the m today Jesus comes in the hour of your dark hour just when it looks bleak just when it seems like nothing is going to work out just when it seems like at the end of your rope that's when he comes walking it may seem scary but that's when he shows up strong in your life that's when he shows up big in your scenario that's when he shows himself strong in the darkest hour he said you don't know what it is he said he comes the hour of your dark hour and you're afraid of it you don't know what it is they didn't know what he was they said oh it's a spirit they were screaming then he called them fear not it is I so put away all that doubt all that depression all that frustration about what happened into the boat because I am on the scene now and once I am on the scene all I want is you to have faith I want you to believe that I could calm this St in your life I want you to believe that everything is going to be all right that's the provision I've brought with my instruction and my command he said it is I in the darkness of our Jesus come along their help that's the way he always does comes in the darkness of our then Jesus came and manifested himself and come to them Peter said if it be you bid me come on the water this is the the show of Faith now this is the display of Faith now he said come on Jesus said come on you know what friends soon he will say you say soon he will come for those in this last days now isn't it strange that the church has gotten this Dark Hour again I'm going to say something here it's not a Doctrine I'm just prophesying you know what's happened it's going to come to a place soon mark my word this is a prophet's word now he said that all denominations are going to have to join The ecumenical council if they don't they can't have the support of the council therefore there'll be a boycott and nobody can go to these churches or go to any churches unless you have a mark from your own church you cannot buy or sell you see it just as it was so it's going to be again a mark unto the Beast and the church they're realizing that spiritual people and you Pentecostal people anyhow are recognizing it you begin to feel it when your churches many of the organization of the Pentecostal and I don't have to call your names but you know right now they are they are coming into it they've done wites what they were and when you do that what you're going to have to do you're going to have to forfeit your Evangelical teaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to have to forfeit your doctrine of the Bible and the members is not going to stand for it real Born Again Christians will die first they are warned by the word they know this thing is coming yes sir and is isn't it strange and right in this darkest hour then Jesus comes along and calls us said don't get scared it's me I'm still with you I'm here to manifest my word as he was then so he is now he said he would do it oh my the master has come and has called for us many sick people here no doubt they're sitting here and the doctor has told you there's no hope for you you may be in your darkest hour and whatever the scenario is you may be in your darkest hour tonight but remember the master has come and called for you and someday someday someday the master is going to come and call for every name that's wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life if yours are not there get it on there now for he's going to come and call even those that are in the grave shall hear his voice and come forth to life the master will come and call for you and while he's calling today answer and make preparations for that day is my advice to you the the promise of this age he promised he would be here the thing that he did he' do again and now again the master has come to call for you Amen in a message love and we're almost getting ready to close paragraph 33 he said Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy ho ghost and he said the promises unto you and your children and to them that are far off even as many as a lord Our God shall call amen that means me that settles it all anything God said you love him so much you believe it this is a message of Faith tonight when he says fear not he's saying do depend on your human faculties do depend on your five senses do depend on how it seems and how it feels and how it looks right he said to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're not oh I my backslides tomorrow I a backslide next week you're not wishy-washy he say I won't worry about that I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him I'll probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee amen oh he that Hearth my words and Believe on him he that said me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but pass from death into life the musicians could get ready there's one more thing I want to I want to strike which is from a message beyond the curtain of time and this is a a vision that brother Branham asked brother Neville to read in that message beyond the curing of time 61 and this is paragraph 41 you know and this is where the angel asked him in in a vision if he wants to be able to pay beyond the curtain of time and the voice asked would you like to see what's just beyond there and I answered it will help me so much what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or not or whether it was translation I do not know but it was unlike any Vision I have ever had I could see the place to which I was taken and I could see myself lying back there upon my bed I said this is a strange thing there were great numbers of people and they came running greeting me crying oh our precious brother first came young woman a apparently in their early 20s and as they would embrace me they said oh precious brother young men in the Brilliance of their Young Manhood with eyes glistening like stars in a dark night with teeth as white as pears embrac me saying our precious brother then I noticed that I too had become young again I looked at myself there and turned and looked back at my old body lying on the bed with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this you could play drw me arrow and then the voice spoke to me this is what you preach that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it suddenly I was back on the bed again I said oh God help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word I don't care what anybody else does Lord let me press to that beautiful joyful place I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you could love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not even matter get perfect love if you are not saved accept Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time may just stand and bow heads oh Heavenly Father Lord in this Vision that's in this message here your Prophet he's so stressed on a need and and her importance to get perfect love because perfect love casts out all fear and that's what we need in the hour say that's one of the things that are wrong with us that we are too afraid we're too scared we're too fearful Lord Lord but you've not given us a spirit of fear Lord but you've given us love and and power and a strong mind Lord Lord we pray tonight that you take these few broken up words Lord that you have
