[13:02] tonight let's just turn to our Bibles to
[13:05] Psalms so sorry to Philippians chapter
[13:08] 3: 13 and
[13:11] 14 Philippians chapter
[13:14] 3: 13 and 14 good to see everyone
[13:19] tonight
[13:21] amen praise the
[13:25] Lord so from verse 13 verse 13
[13:29] it says
[13:30] here
[13:33] Brethren I count on myself to have
[13:37] apprehended but this one thing I
[13:40] do forgetting those things which are
[13:43] behind and reaching forth onto these
[13:47] things which are
[13:49] before I press towards the Mark or the
[13:52] priz of the High Calling of God in
[13:56] Christ Jesus amen may the Lord bless
[13:58] bless his will tonight in Jesus name
[14:03] amen so just for a few minutes I just
[14:05] want to share on the topic the titled
[14:08] press towards the Mark we must have the
[14:12] token press towards the Mark we must
[14:15] have the
[14:17] token and I was thinking about the word
[14:22] requirement and how in each age there
[14:25] was a
[14:26] requirement which was needed to be met
[14:29] by the people of that
[14:31] age it is something that is
[14:34] compulsory a necessary condition a
[14:39] prerequisite for
[14:42] something I recall in Noah's
[14:46] time in order to be
[14:48] saved the people were required to go
[14:51] into the
[14:53] ark it was a
[14:55] requirement it was a necessary condition
[14:59] to ensure their
[15:02] safety and when God shut the door of the
[15:06] Ark anyone found outside
[15:12] perished I was sharing with brother
[15:14] Gideon two Sundays
[15:16] ago on on on on this and no matter how
[15:21] good you you
[15:23] were or how many times you went to
[15:26] church or who you might be
[15:29] maybe you might be a really nice person
[15:31] once you did not meet the
[15:33] requirement you
[15:37] perished maybe I can say this way as
[15:39] long as you have met the
[15:42] requirement then you are safe let we say
[15:45] Amen
[15:46] tonight praise
[15:49] God I actually had a dream and I was
[15:52] telling brother Gideon about it
[15:54] concerning you know the ark with no and
[15:57] so on
[15:59] nice
[16:00] people helpful people good people came
[16:05] knocking on Noah's door of the
[16:09] Ark but they too perished as they had
[16:13] not met the requirement of the
[16:17] day so God is not a respector of persons
[16:21] it does not matter who it is
[16:26] amen the children of is Israel before
[16:29] they left
[16:31] Egypt the last plague of death was going
[16:34] to strike the
[16:36] land and the Death Angel was
[16:39] approaching they had a requirement for
[16:44] safety before the wrath of God passed
[16:47] through the land the blood had to be
[16:50] applied
[16:52] first they had to kill a lamb in the
[16:55] evening time and apply the blood on the
[16:59] doorpost that was the requirement for
[17:02] that day can we say Amen
[17:04] tonight
[17:06] amen
[17:08] anyone any family that did not meet the
[17:13] requirements the firstborn of that
[17:16] family
[17:20] perished I want you to see that in every
[17:23] major
[17:25] Exodus in every major age of
[17:29] transitioning there was a requirement
[17:31] for the
[17:34] safety so my brother and my sister in
[17:37] this
[17:38] age we have a
[17:41] requirement and the requirement is the
[17:46] token the token
[17:48] applied the token
[17:51] displayed
[17:54] amen so Saints
[17:57] tonight
[17:59] this requirement is more than life and
[18:03] death so be reverent with Godly Fai it
[18:07] is very
[18:10] serious from the message the tokan 1963
[18:14] brother Bram
[18:16] says I don't care you might have cast
[18:19] out
[18:21] Devils you may have healed the Sick by
[18:23] your prayer of
[18:25] faith you may have preached the gospel
[18:29] you might be a
[18:31] believer note but if that token is not
[18:35] there you are under the WTH of
[18:41] God depart from me work of iniquity I
[18:45] never even knew
[18:48] you I know it sounds rough but may God
[18:51] Shake us tonight and give us a drive in
[18:55] our spirit to press towards the mark
[18:59] press towards the mark somebody say
[19:01] press
[19:02] tonight press
[19:05] amen brandom
[19:08] continues but when I see the
[19:10] token I will pass over you yeah what he
[19:14] says it's God's requirement of this
[19:20] hour the token is God's requirement of
[19:24] this hour he says the evening time
[19:29] message is to apply the token can we say
[19:32] Amen
[19:33] tonight amen praise
[19:36] God so don't rely on how much you have
[19:40] done or how good you are or how much you
[19:45] know bam says when the wroth of God
[19:50] flashes it will only recognize the
[19:55] token Oh Glory to God Amen
[19:59] I'm not trying to bring a message of
[20:00] fear to scare you but at the same time I
[20:04] want you to see the enormous importance
[20:06] of this
[20:08] requirement and may the Holy Spirit
[20:10] Quicken it to you tonight and impress
[20:13] upon us the urgency and the seriousness
[20:17] of this topic amen praise God so from
[20:21] the message the
[20:24] token B is saying the token is every
[20:28] evidence that a price has been
[20:31] paid because a price was
[20:36] required the price that was paid was the
[20:39] life of Jesus Christ and he gave his
[20:44] life and his holy spirit comes back upon
[20:49] you as a token that you are received
[20:53] Give the Lord a hand of praise tonight
[20:55] Hallelujah glory to God Amen and he has
[20:58] received you tonight amen

[21:16] need this is the requirement for this
[21:20] hour and we have to press towards that
[21:24] Mark
[21:25] tonight praise God again from the
[21:28] message the token brother Bram
[21:30] says when you receive the Holy Ghost

[22:10] time pleading and encouraging the
[22:14] brandom Tabernacle to get the

[24:14] crying we've got to be
[24:16] marked we have to press towards the mark
[24:20] praise God

[24:33] knees praying for the sins of the
[24:36] country sighing and crying Glory he said
[24:40] put a mark on those who sigh and
