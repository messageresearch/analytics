========================================

Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking among us. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew. He came with names. &gt;&gt; Had to call Peter come. &gt;&gt; Andrew come. &gt;&gt; Philip come. &gt;&gt; He just called them. &gt;&gt; And they were called to be manifested sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know that yet. &gt;&gt; They're just following this man like Messiah. &gt;&gt; They're just following this man with his long gong and this beard. &gt;&gt; He cast in devil and healing the sick. &gt;&gt; And he begin to throw promises over them. &gt;&gt; The same works I do shall you do also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Little while the world seeth me no more, but you shall see me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. If you shall see it in this mountain be moved and no doubt in your heart, you can have what you say because you come from the same source I come from. You come from the same gene germ. You come from the same birth word. [Applause] Then to cap it off in his resurrection ministry, he tell them as my father sent me, so send you. And the father that sent him was in him. So he said, I'm going to be in you. At that day, you going to know I'm in the father, you in me, and I in you. St. John 14:20, he prophesy upon them that the day is coming. They'll move on from partial realization into perfect realization that they will come in that they will know where they come from, where they GO IN. PERFECT REALIZATION COME FROM GOD GOING BACK TO GOD. OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise God. My God. These brothers had no degree. These brothers didn't have education, but they had revelation because when the spirit reveal it to you, brother, it's good as getting whatever. Praise God. It's the greatest thing that could strike your soul. When the spirit break upon you by revelation, [Applause] &gt;&gt; it change the way you dress. IT CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK. YOU STOP FOLLOWING PEOPLE AND YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE START TO FOLLOW YOU BECAUSE YOU BECOME PART OF THE BOOK. YOU BECOME PART OF THE CALL OF GOD. GOD USING YOU TO CALL OTHERS, NOT THE DEVIL PULLING YOU OUT, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU PRAISE GOD PULLING OTHERS IN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF CALLING THESE MEN WHAT I WILL MAKE YOU FISHES OF MEN. &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, here here what it is. I call you &gt;&gt; because your name is on the book. &gt;&gt; I call you to become a fisherman to call other names in the book. [Applause] So that is how you going TO GET ALL THE SONS together &gt;&gt; because the word has to come from the mouth &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WORD COME FROM HIS MOUTH. LET THERE BE LET THERE BE. &gt;&gt; SO IT HAD TO COME FROM THE MOUTH OF A SON. &gt;&gt; So the son OF GOD COME AND SPOKE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN OF THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ADAM WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEAK TO HIS WIFE &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH A SPOKEN WORD SON &gt;&gt; BUT THEY FELL IN THE FLESH AND WENT ON TO SEX. BUT ADAM WAS TO speak and eat, CONCEIVE AND BRING FORTH THE NEXT ADAM. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER, &gt;&gt; SONS OF GOOD, &gt;&gt; BUT WE FELL FROM THAT. BUT WE ARE GOING BACK TO THAT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. WE ARE GOING BACK WHERE WE FELL FROM. DON'T STAY FALLEN. DON'T SIT FALLEN. DON'T SIT IN YOUR SIN. REPENT THIS MORNING. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're going back. &gt;&gt; Going back. &gt;&gt; Man trying to hold us in church. man trying to churchify us. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Be a nice church member. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And you will make it. That's a lie from the pit of hell. &gt;&gt; Direct. &gt;&gt; Bible says THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS preached &gt;&gt; and every man &gt;&gt; press their way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Into it. Every man. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to push your way into it. &gt;&gt; You got to press your way for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Resurrection about to take place. &gt;&gt; Some going to resurrect to glory &gt;&gt; and resurrect to shame and contempt. &gt;&gt; And many who turn people to righteousness shall shine as stars. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who have you turned to righteousness? &gt;&gt; Who you have encouraged into righteousness? You encourage people to slackness. You encourage people to sin. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; If you encourage people into slackness and sin, don't do that. Encourage others to righteousness. We leave the world to encounter righteousness. We go into a righteous place. We serve in a righteous God. A God who keep his word. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. So, let me read this again. The last name goes on that book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or the last name that's redeemed that was put on that book that settles it. He comes to claim what he's redeemed. It might be a strange time, but Brown. Did you ever think people will go right on preaching? The church will go right on even thinking they're getting people saved. It is too late. Then it's over. &gt;&gt; And the message will go to the totally lost. &gt;&gt; What? Wait a minute. Brother, you mean we have to preach to people who are totally lost. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Once had opportunity to repent, once opportunity to get it straight and rejected it. &gt;&gt; It was done in days of Noah, seven days in the ark. It was done in the days of Sodom preaching to the eternal lost that were in prison that repented not longsuffering and know souls in prison. I hope you're not one of them tonight. A soul in prison. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. That the gospel stop having effect upon your life and you figure you're running your own show and you forget God called you out. &gt;&gt; God bless your life. God forgive you. God splash blood upon you. When you look back you this invisible God working around you all the time. But you're you're blinded to see the effect and the power of God's preserving and God's protection. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I begin to see in my own life. I didn't give myself a vision. God did. &gt;&gt; I don't give myself inspiration. God does. &gt;&gt; All that is God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What to preach this morning? He give me &gt;&gt; to share this with you. that where we at we coming into the fullness of time &gt;&gt; and we can look forward to see sons of God coming forth &gt;&gt; to be manifested &gt;&gt; not more talkless talk &gt;&gt; more action &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; Satan time for Satan to see some drama &gt;&gt; see all the time in the upper room Satan didn't didn't believe they're coming for &gt;&gt; there was only staging and speaking in tonga in the upper room he said that didn't serve the devil say oh they getting excited glen rest but when Peter &gt;&gt; came to the gate called beautiful &gt;&gt; and the man was laying Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none." &gt;&gt; Such as Baram said, "The devil came over and said, "No, we have to stop that." &gt;&gt; That's a manifested son. Now &gt;&gt; that is Jesus reproducing himself. &gt;&gt; You thought Jesus was trouble. Now we have more trouble. &gt;&gt; There was only one Jesus. Now we have a whole bunch of them, &gt;&gt; acting like Jesus, talking like Jesus. A bunch of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Satan recognized his kingdom in trouble &gt;&gt; because JESUS WAS ONE MAN. But it seem he has reproduced himself. It seem like the pillar of fire have divided. &gt;&gt; It seem like EVERYBODY GET THEIR PORTION. &gt;&gt; IT SEEM LIKE THEY GOT THE INHERITANCE AND THEY'RE MOVING OUT WITH IT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE MOVING OUT WITH IT. THE TOKEN IS PART OF THEM. THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON THE SICK. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PRAY JUST TO LAY HANDS ON THE SICK. YOU'RE NOT HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING because the quickening power was all over them. THE QUICKENING POWER GOING TO BE ALL OVER YOU. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. [Applause] YOU HEARD THE TESTIMONY. YOU MAY BE SEATED. But Abraham wife have this big tumor, big like a grapefruit showing through her stomach or whatever his things like that. He on the fields preaching. God tell him speak for his wife. He next country &gt;&gt; and he's saying before &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; the doctor's hand touches my wife. She's supposed to want your operation operation. Before the doctor's hand touches my wife, the tumor will go down. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the tumor. Watch this. &gt;&gt; Time, space, &gt;&gt; distance. &gt;&gt; Can't stop IT, YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT TUMOR is right in next dimension there. That demon, that tumor, that spirit is in the next dimension. So he is talking it right there, you know. &gt;&gt; When he speaking, that demon have to respond, you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; That demon take the exit and get out. She would [Applause] &gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt; healed. &gt;&gt; Before the doctor's HAND COULD TOUCH MY WIFE, &gt;&gt; TUMOR GONE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A SON SAY GONE. COULD YOU IMAGINE COMING BACK TO THE SPOT WHERE GOD START TO HONOR HIS SON'S WORD [Applause] &gt;&gt; WHEN ELIJAH BELIEVE IT CURSED THE CHILDREN BEARS COME AND EAT THEM. HE said God has to honor his word. &gt;&gt; But a son talking there, &gt;&gt; it's scary. &gt;&gt; That's why he said be careful what you say. &gt;&gt; Power is in your tongue. &gt;&gt; Power of deliverance, power of restoration is in your tongue, in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As a man think in his heart, so is he. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you think you you're done, you're done. &gt;&gt; If you think you can't make it, you can't make it. You &gt;&gt; think you got to get a victory? You can't get a victory because you that's you. &gt;&gt; them two those those 12 spies come and say we we land is a good land but we can't take it. But have chance in the land they couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; Caleb said we are more than able to take it. Let's go up at once. &gt;&gt; God honored Caleb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 40 years seeing all his brethren falling one by one and dying. Endless funeral services had to endure all of that. And Caleb and Joshua and a bunch of young people cross over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To possess that land. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Okay, I still have to say, "Give me my mountain." &gt;&gt; It's still not easy. &gt;&gt; Mountain not flat. &gt;&gt; Mountain not plain. You have to climb to get where you're going, brother. &gt;&gt; You need strength to climb. &gt;&gt; You need grace to climb. &gt;&gt; Some of you looking tired. &gt;&gt; Hope you're not tired. &gt;&gt; I don't want physically tired, you know, spiritually tired. You can't be tired now. You know, you can't afford to be. &gt;&gt; So, if you lose your teeth, use your gum. &gt;&gt; But you have to climb. Hold yourself up. &gt;&gt; Pull yourself up by your socks. &gt;&gt; But you got to climb. Climb a little higher &gt;&gt; because Jesus is higher. You got to climb a little higher. &gt;&gt; Climb up with faith and virtue and knowledge. You need that temperance, that patience, that gunness. You have to have all seven virtues. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My be warned. &gt;&gt; Just don't stand around. Let's do something about it. If we are not right with God, let get right with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; My and this self-sided church needs today to humble itself back again. It got to a place there's no confession. There's no love among the people. It seem like dying daily. Church is cooling off. Everywhere you find revival is over. You find a cooling off. We need a humiliating. &gt;&gt; They asked for a general and got a lamb. God knew what they needed. That's what the world needs today is a savior. A savior to this condition. Something that can hold it together. Not an educated regime. Not some mechanical system. not some educational system. What we need is the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and saving grace back in the church where men and women and girls can be saved. &gt;&gt; Not not you go to church. You are saved. &gt;&gt; So you can tell somebody, "No, I'm not going there. I am saved." &gt;&gt; I'm not going with you to smoke, to drink, to party. I am a saved person. Jesus saved me and I'm grateful to God. &gt;&gt; And the life that I live, I'm not living that life anymore. &gt;&gt; If any of my in Christ is a new creature, is a new creation. I am changed. I am changing. I want something better for my life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could we take some more? &gt;&gt; Hear this one. It may be almost past feeling time. &gt;&gt; Almost past feeling time. Because there will come a time like that when the spirit of God will be retaken from the earth. &gt;&gt; So people can't feel like how they want to feel. Past feeling time. There will be no more. The church will remain a while preaching cause it has to preach to the eternal lost. &gt;&gt; That is just part of the church ministry. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. has to preach to the eternal loss. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't cut the work short for elected sake, there is some that's elected to eternal life. We all know that they got eternal life. And if you don't cut it short for their sake, no flesh shall be saved. The world mets a doom every 2,000 years. We know systems that fall apart in the days of Noah, in the days of Christ, and so on. Now the spirit the dynamics of the promised word to drive to get into the church and drive them to Calvary yonder and then to the rapture. &gt;&gt; So he prophesied that the spirit will come to drive us to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we have a crucifixion with Christ. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now you say, "Wait a minute. Now what? The prophets rebuke those women in them days. They call them woman haters." Now wait a minute. You're writing the scriptures down. A woman that lives in worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures of God. So the woman that lives in worldly pleasure is dead while she's living. And that's what the prophet said St. Paul. The woman that lives in this worldly condition is dead while she's living. And if she rejects mercy, she can cross the separating line where there is no place for her no more. And then where is she at? With her painted eyes, her cut here, she crossed the line with nowhere to come back. There's got to be, listen, listen. There's got to be a ministry preached to her. But remember, it's all over. It is done. It's just a haunting. There will be a ministry that will show great signs and wonders. Jo said so. There will be no time for redemption. It's all over. The lamb done took his book. His redeemed is over. As Jesus first preached and was rejected, and then went and haunted those that were there, preached to them that were in prison, could not repent. No time for salvation. That same ministry will have to repeat again. &gt;&gt; What if that could be the third P to the eternal lost? What if it is there? I hope it's not. What if it is? Think of it a minute now. What if it is? God forbid I got children, but it looks pretty close. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Noah's ministry, all ministry done the same. Noah preached exactly went into the ark. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he went into the ark, there were seven days nothing happened. And the testimony preached to the doom. All right. &gt;&gt; Not by speaking in tongues, not by dancing in the spirit, not by joining church, not by the fruit of the spirit. Watch. But it's the word living. &gt;&gt; There it is. If they only have looked, he was Messiah. He was the living word made manifest. &gt;&gt; You say the church, they'll go right on just the same. But remember all this time, Noah was in the ark. The bride, you compare it now. The bride is sealed with Christ. The last member has been redeemed. The sixth seal produced itself. And we know that the earthquake, we know that judgment. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The seventh seal brings him to the earth. Tree is perfection. The ministry comes to perfection when it's reproduced Christ again in natural among human beings. He did not say the ministry come to perfection when the ministry could preach mysteries. &gt;&gt; He said when Christ is reproduced. So somewhere along that line, we've got to see Christ oozing out all our flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to see this word become flesh. &gt;&gt; Not talk, not doctrine. And we had THAT FOR 50 YEARS. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING MORE than that. &gt;&gt; It has to be alive. &gt;&gt; Because that's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine YOU ON YOUR JOB TESTIFYING ABOUT THE love of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What female could come around that? &gt;&gt; You're not compromising. &gt;&gt; You're on the word. Your testimony is true. &gt;&gt; You're saying your testimony out. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. Yes. &gt;&gt; So then if you say you want to get a drink with us, you know, I said I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; You didn't say a drinking Christian. I don't have that. &gt;&gt; You have church members to drink. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're living for Christ. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; It's just three things that knock out men, you know. Woman, money, and popularity. Just three. Not a hund of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all them compared to the lust of the eyes, lust of defection, the pride of life. It's just three things. All men of God through the Bible, three things. &gt;&gt; Woman, money, and popularity. &gt;&gt; They catching money, catching woman. Catching fame. &gt;&gt; Want popular. You want to be looking everywhere. You're looking for selfies or looking for somebody take your picture. &gt;&gt; You're looking out for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Long as you see that desire cut inside of there. Devil have no room inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For your purpose in your God. You're not going to fall by no woman. You're going to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; You're going to stay with the word, you not be popular &gt;&gt; because to be popular, you got to compromise. &gt;&gt; You got to please everybody. &gt;&gt; And then you become a dish rag. &gt;&gt; Everybody can wipe the floor with you &gt;&gt; because you're not making no stand. But when you make a stand, people respect you. Not what you're giving to. People respect you for what you stand for. &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. PEOPLE DON'T RESPECT YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN TO. People respect you for what you stand for. What are you standing for? &gt;&gt; What are your principles? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when YOU START TO STAND LIKE THAT, FORGET IT. YOU'RE GOING STRONGER EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; Because the devil can't get stronger. Don't tell me that. &gt;&gt; You could get stronger. The devil is still the devil. &gt;&gt; He permanently the devil. He can't change. But you are not permanent &gt;&gt; sinner. Permanent church member. know you're growing in grace &gt;&gt; and in knowledge &gt;&gt; every day you're coming closer &gt;&gt; to your fullness of time when you going to be manifested when your life will be confirmed. EVERY DAY YOU'RE GETTING STRONGER. BELIEVE THAT. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THAT. &gt;&gt; Say every day. &gt;&gt; Every day &gt;&gt; I am GETTING STRONGER. &gt;&gt; SAY IT AGAIN. EVERY DAY &gt;&gt; every day &gt;&gt; I'm getting stronger. &gt;&gt; I'm getting stronger. &gt;&gt; ONE MORE TIME LOUD. EVERY DAY &gt;&gt; EVERY DAY &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING STRONGER. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. Glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT A BRAND SAID WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME TO YOU, IT COME like a little light, &gt;&gt; like a button. &gt;&gt; And as you die out, &gt;&gt; as you give up this and give up that, that button, light expands &gt;&gt; to fill your entire being. So the more you GIVE UP THIS, LET GO THIS, THAT LIGHT BEGIN TO EXPAND, take over your mind, take over your spirit, TAKE OVER YOUR DESIRES, TAKE OVER YOUR MOTIVES, TAKE OVER YOUR OBJECTIVES, YOU HAVE THE OBJECTIVES OF GOD, YOU HAVE THE MOTIVES OF GOD, YOU HAVE THE PURPOSE OF GOD, YOU'RE BECOMING THE IMAGE OF GOD BECAUSE THAT LIGHT IS EXPANDING SO MUCH TILL THE LIGHT BEGIN TO OOZE OUT. THEN THAT LIGHT CAST A SHADOW AND PEOPLE WERE HEALED IN PETER'S SHADOW BECAUSE THAT LIGHT WAS IN PETER THROWING THE SHADOW OF GOD. WHEN PETER WALKED OVER THE SICK, THE SICK COULDN'T REMAIN SICK. GOD HELP ME THIS MORNING. DUCK IS COMING BACK. &gt;&gt; USC power yet. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. So, that's what I look at. What is a minister trying to introduce to the people? What is a man focusing on? What is his objective? &gt;&gt; Who is he pointing the people to? Himself, the church, or to Christ? &gt;&gt; Because we supposed to point people to Christ. &gt;&gt; And Christ will point you to the cross &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU DIE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY WANT TO GET TO HEAVEN, but nobody want to die. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO CROSS JORDAN, YOU'RE GONNA DIE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JORDAN WAS THE TYPE THAT HAD TO CROSS OVER TO POSSESS THE LAND. &gt;&gt; Stop using binoculars, looking over Jordan through binoculars, seeing the land long distance. Go where you cross over. &gt;&gt; Cross Jordan &gt;&gt; and face them Hittites. Face them Jebusites. Face them devils out there. Face them personal demons. FACE THE LUST OF THE EYES. FACE THE LUST OF THE FLESH. FACE THE PRIDE OF LIFE. FACE ALL THE DEVIL OUT THERE AND OVERCOME. SAY, "I AM GOING TO OVERCOME. I HAVE TO OVERCOME. Come on, give the LORD A HIGH SHOUT AND ARMS. &gt;&gt; Got to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Overcome Hollywood. Overcome movies. Overcome television. Overcome all these STYLES AND FASHION. FORGET THEM MAGAZINES. DON'T LET THE MAGAZINE DETERMINE YOUR STYLES, [Applause] &gt;&gt; YOUR HAIRSTYLE, YOUR LIFESTYLE. LET THE HOLY GHOST DETERMINE THAT. GET INSPIRED BY GOD. DON'T BE A PHOTOCOPY. BE ORIGINAL. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [Applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Trees perfection. The ministry comes to perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural among human beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ being reproduced a longing for the word to become flesh. &gt;&gt; Not the word to become more word and more talk but the word to become flesh in your flesh &gt;&gt; that you could react correctly. You could react like a scripturally. You could react like a true believer like a true son. Not out of order but really in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Look at Paul. Paul had this demon following him and praise that he couldn't rebuke the spirit until God tell him. &gt;&gt; That's discipline. &gt;&gt; That order spirit's following you. And you can't do anything until God say because he's led by the spirit &gt;&gt; directed by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Look at them two characters want to say come out devil in the name of of Jesus and Paul preaching. They want what power they want to show somebody you have something. Come out devil in the name of Jesus Paul preaching. &gt;&gt; The devil say Paul I know. Peter, I know, &gt;&gt; but who are you? &gt;&gt; Then they jump on him. &gt;&gt; Jump on them. &gt;&gt; Now, what that says, those demons know Peter and Paul. &gt;&gt; They know the Holy Ghost when the man have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Bible say he suffer no man to do them wrong. &gt;&gt; Saying touch not my anointed, &gt;&gt; I'll do my prophets no harm. God suffered no man to do them wrong. &gt;&gt; While they were few in number, &gt;&gt; he said he while THEY WERE FEW IN NUMBER, &gt;&gt; HE SUFFERED no man to do them wrong. &gt;&gt; My God. God just have a purpose &gt;&gt; that the seeds of the righteous comfort. &gt;&gt; Remember, even though cut short, all no flesh shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Could we take a little more? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, I'm praying here in souls in prison. He said, "Lord Jesus, I've done the best I know. I've done all that I know. Grant Lord that the mercy's doors are still open of these hundreds literally hundreds seeking thee at this time. Take away every sinful blood. Take them in today. I plead with all my heart as we see not only somebody talking but scripture itself bringing us to this hour and that vision of a little boy seeing those people in that condition and now think that hell itself mercy have been blotted off from the earth and how hell itself is here and the people Lord are in this hideous condition. He said, "Almighty God, on this elected church, I pray God that you would pour out your blessings that they might receive a ministry of testimony like Lot had, like Noah had, like Jesus had onto the eternal loss. If it be there that they themselves are sealed into the kingdom of God, but giving witness to Jesus Christ being the same yesterday, today, and forever." Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. So friends, we coming down to them scriptures &gt;&gt; of him that's filthy be filthy still. &gt;&gt; Righteous righteous still holy holy still. &gt;&gt; And amidst all of that, God promised a message of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the time of the coming of the headstone. And he said, not by might, not by power, but by my spirit. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And that messages of grace coming in the midst of judgment. &gt;&gt; In the midst of judgment, sir, &gt;&gt; God still have grace for your elected ones, your loved ones, the grace of God coming to you. And that's why you should be praising him and worshiping him continually. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, your life is not your own. I sure you have some loved ones. Somebody you're concerned about and burdened about. Praise God. And you could press your way to live for them. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well wasn't ordained to get books and tapes. She was ordained to meet Messiah. &gt;&gt; She ordained to meet the word made flesh. And there are some people not ordained to get books and tapes. They ought to meet you. &gt;&gt; And you becoming a living testimony, a written epistle read and known of all men. Some of the people wouldn't win by a book or or some pamphlet, but you're going to win by your life. &gt;&gt; Now you having a testimony. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What the Bible say, I thought of the grace of God. He's not all. Just back up a little bit here now. He said, Paul said, "Do I speak with tongues of men and angels? Do I have discernment? Do I have gifts? Do I take my goods to feed the poor? Do I can move mountains with faith? Do I have knowledge to understand all things? I am nothing till love comes in, which is grace." &gt;&gt; God has to do it. &gt;&gt; You can do all these things and still be lost. It is grace that saves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought of grace of God how he could do that save to the uttermost and would take a power rest like myself give me the opportunity to preach the gospel to see others saved and see them healed see homes and be broken up straighten up again see lives that have been ruined made right again and to give me grace I said it's amazing grace then come to a degraded low squirrel hun out in the woods form himself into a form of a rainbow which means covenant with a message he g me to preach and formed it here for as a covenant and he's behind it this is the message of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah Praise God. In the garden of Eden when Adam was cut off, God grace came down. He cut lamb skin and give them lamb skin to cover them. Isn't that right? Praise the name of the Lord. The grace was promised in the garden of Eden and grace came to Adam and Eve. Nowhere to go, nowhere where to turn. But grace made a way. Let me say this, my sinner friend. You may be here this morning a prostitute. You may be here this morning a woman chaser. You may be here a drunkard, a gambler, a murderer. You might be here an impure husband and impure wife. You might be the violence of sinner. You say, "I'm past that seed of redemption." No, you are not. Or you wouldn't be at church this morning. &gt;&gt; Grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you will accept it. &gt;&gt; Adam had to be willing to accept it. Stop studying this one do you and this one do you. Forget the others. Forget human. Study what God has already done for you. Study how God put your name on the book. Study the grace of God come into your life. You could be dead a long time ago &gt;&gt; and so can I be myself also. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. SHOUT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE YET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I have more fire in this thing in here. &gt;&gt; We now ABOUT TO GET STARTED. &gt;&gt; WE NOW GET INTO THE MESSAGE HERE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW, WE ABOUT TO GET INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; All that was a backdrop. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. BUT WE NOW COME INTO THE FULLNESS OF TIME &gt;&gt; because once you come to your time, your time has come. &gt;&gt; Oh, GLORY TO GOD. PRAISE GOD. YOUR TIME OF FULFILLMENT, &gt;&gt; YOUR TIME OF HARVEST. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Put a man. I'm in adoption. The mission of his will according to his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; According to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself &gt;&gt; that in the dispensation of the fullness of time, we learn that the fullness of time is waiting for what? the fullness of all time. The time that sin will cease. The time that death will cease. The time that sickness will cease. The time when sin will cease. The time when all the perversion will cease. The time where time itself will cease. &gt;&gt; That is the dispensation of fullness of time by gather together in one all things in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, so watch. He says, "So I obtain an inheritance. Somebody had to leave you something to inherit it." Is that right? An inheritance. What inheritance do we have? What inheritance did I have? I didn't have any. &gt;&gt; But God left me an inheritance. When he put my name on the lamb's book of life, &gt;&gt; that is when he left you an inheritance. &gt;&gt; So if you believe YOUR NAME IS ON THAT BOOK, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ALSO THAT YOU HAVE &gt;&gt; AS OF NOW, &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW, &gt;&gt; you have &gt;&gt; an inheritance. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. TELL SOMEBODY, I HAVE AN INHERITANCE. TELL SOMEBODY THAT. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] What inheritance do we have? &gt;&gt; I didn't have any. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God left me inheritance &gt;&gt; when he put my name in the land book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So when he put your name, the inheritance was right next to it. &gt;&gt; And it was sealed &gt;&gt; with seven seals. &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT? &gt;&gt; YOUR NAME AND INHERITANCE WAS SEALED WITH SEVEN SEALS. SO WHEN THE SEA IS BROKE, IT BROKE YOUR NAME AND IT BROKE INHERITANCE. IT BROKE YOUR NAME AND IT BROKE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Devil's a liar this morning. THE DEVIL IS A LIAR THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. A LIAR EVERY TIME YOU OPEN HIS MOUTH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Now you say, "Wait a minute, brother. Jesus did when he died for you. No. Jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me. No. He said now God before the foundation of the world. He said no. We see God was self-existent and there was nothing there. &gt;&gt; So his own self, his own good counsel produced these things that he might through this one man through Christ Jesus gather it up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if I have a right inheritance of something, if God is knocking on my heart and say, "William Brandom, I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel. I have an inheritance of eternal life." God sent Jesus &gt;&gt; to make that inheritance &gt;&gt; real to me. &gt;&gt; So, the inheritance is fixed. &gt;&gt; You can't remember it. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE SENT JESUS TO BEGIN TO UNFOLD THIS BOOK. &gt;&gt; TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE real deal. &gt;&gt; This is the real THING &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE GOING BACK &gt;&gt; TO THE MANIFESTATION &gt;&gt; OF YOUR SUNSHIP &gt;&gt; OF YOUR GODSHIP &gt;&gt; OF YOUR INHERITANCE. IT IS REAL. [Music] WATCH. &gt;&gt; God sent Jesus to make the inheritance real to me &gt;&gt; because there was nothing I could do to inherit it. &gt;&gt; It was blank. There's nothing I could do. But in the fullness of time, &gt;&gt; God sent his own good time. &gt;&gt; Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT GO BACK TO MY INHERITANCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HIS BLOOD WAS SHED NOT FOR YOU TO occupy a church pew &gt;&gt; and say I'm a church member. I belong to this tabernacle. That's not what his blood was SHED FOR. HIS BLOOD WAS SHED FOR YOU TO GO BACK TO YOUR INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. GLORY TO GOD. WHAT INHERITANCE? SUNSHIP. &gt;&gt; Good ship. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR INHERITANCE. GOING BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM. AND THE STRONGER you get, the less the devil have anything to do with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. He said, "Not this bunch." &gt;&gt; Not this people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You become a dangerous man on the earth. &gt;&gt; You become God's agent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's read on. &gt;&gt; Now, this may choke you to death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But did you know that all men that are sons of God are amateur gods? [Applause] God didn't come for you to be more man and you're more man like a star boy. &gt;&gt; You some flash something. God come that you be could become a amateur god. &gt;&gt; A small one of the big one. &gt;&gt; That what Adam was supposed to be &gt;&gt; a small one. So when you pray you supposed to pray with confidence. You supposed to pray with target. &gt;&gt; I thank thee father for that. You always hear me &gt;&gt; but I pray not for my sake but for their sake. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Disciples even asked Jesus teach us how to pray. &gt;&gt; They know how to pray. How how this fishermanmen what praying? &gt;&gt; They know what the Pharisees praying &gt;&gt; cuz the Pharisees are repeating prayers. prayers of Moses and what them saying their own thing. When Jesus comes to say he said teach them how to pray our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name and to worship and title them come and what and he run them through the whole prayer and on top that he said I give us this our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He start give us daily bread pray give us our daily bread. Lord is our prayer say after I get the bread. &gt;&gt; No adoration and worship and everything else and then we cap it off with forgiveness. forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. &gt;&gt; Everything inside the prayer, &gt;&gt; faith in their virtue and their knowledge, everything inside that prayer. &gt;&gt; Write up the forgiveness and then thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; When you can forgive, you're ready for the kingdom to come. Help me preach somebody. [Applause] THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO FORGIVE, YOU'RE READY FOR the kingdom to come. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many ever know? How many know Jesus said? So, the Bible said, "Do you not do your not do did not your law say that you are gods and you call them gods?" Which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods had full domain over the dominion of the world. He gave him dominion over all things. He lost his godship. Speaking about Adam, he lost his sunship. He lost his domain and Satan took it over. But brother, we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God &gt;&gt; who will come back and take it over again. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the fullness of time. &gt;&gt; That's my title. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? &gt;&gt; THE FULLNESS OF TIME &gt;&gt; FOR GOD'S SONS &gt;&gt; TO COME back &gt;&gt; when THE P OH, GLORY. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, HELP ME, JESUS.

Waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE FULL SONS OF GOD WILL BE MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; When when when when is the fullness OF TIME? WHEN THIS PYRAMID GETS TO THE TOP? &gt;&gt; FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE. SEVEN CHURCH AGES, SEVEN VIRTUES. Bring the pyramid to the very top. TOP OF BROTHERLY KINDNESS, SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS, NO ARTS, NO GRUDGES. YOU COULD WALK INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER. IF I PERISH, I PERISH. TIME FOR CHARITY. TIME FOR DYNAMICS. TIME FOR OFFERING MEN WITH FIRE. TIME FOR THE PILLAR OF FIRE. TIME FOR WHERE IS THE LORD? GOD OF ELIJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; When the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every power that Satan got away from him. &gt;&gt; So, Satan can flick your family with cancer and you take that away. What next? take that away. BLIND IS BLIND. SEE, TAKE THAT AWAY. DEATH, SPEAK, HEAR, DUMB, SPEAK, TAKE THAT AWAY. &gt;&gt; Take it away. AS SICKNESS COME, WE SEND IT BACK. &gt;&gt; AS DISEASE COME, WE SEND IT BACK. &gt;&gt; GLORY to God. Brother said, "Nothing will stop this bride, &gt;&gt; not even death. This bride ordained to be changed and transformed. &gt;&gt; She's walking to the resurrection debt proof. &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. Not even death going to stop this bride. &gt;&gt; No sickness going to stop this bride. The cripples going to walk. The deaf going to be raised up. THE BLIND GOING TO SEE. THE DUMB GOING TO SPEAK. The deaf going to hear. AND THE CHURCH WILL HAVE a revival. &gt;&gt; I'm on expectation for it. AND IT'S JULY HARVEST TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY. ONE DAY, 7 MONTHS WILL REPRESENT SEVEN CHURCH AGES. THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARVEST. WHAT IF IT'S NOW? &gt;&gt; What if it's you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fullness of time. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; When the power of God will walk out &gt;&gt; and will take every power that seal and God away from him. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; All them ministers and preachers that feel they own the people. &gt;&gt; They don't even understand the people don't belong to them. &gt;&gt; But they feel they're married to the people. &gt;&gt; Abraham say the bride should be in the word to know how the reveal word. &gt;&gt; Your husband, &gt;&gt; your husband not the man in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; You're crazy. &gt;&gt; That was taken way out of context. &gt;&gt; Your husband is Christ. &gt;&gt; That's your husband. He looking for a bride. &gt;&gt; That's why he's an ela. Not have a bunch of husbands all around. &gt;&gt; His one husband is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body called the church. &gt;&gt; I want to say he is the head. &gt;&gt; The cap. &gt;&gt; The church is the bride's body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So you can't fit the bride into one building &gt;&gt; into one country or one language or tongue &gt;&gt; out of many nation, tongues and people all over the world. &gt;&gt; God have a people for his name's sake. this gentile bride &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR &gt;&gt; coming to a close &gt;&gt; because we're coming to the top of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; We have more to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW COMING TO THIS GREAT HIDDEN MYSTERY THAT HAS BEEN HID FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE world now being revealed to the last days to the sons of God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU BELIEVE it to be true that the son of God are to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a hidden mystery. &gt;&gt; Sons of God to be manifested. &gt;&gt; People preachers preaching but we not talking about that. But Abraham was an example son. &gt;&gt; So you can say storm coming and rebuke the storm &gt;&gt; and the sun come and shine for days &gt;&gt; because a son a son of God spoke it. &gt;&gt; Little fish dead in the water. All of a sudden the pill sermon that's not an exhortation. THAT'S A MANIFESTATION. THAT WAS EVENING CHURCH. Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. IT WASN'T EVEN IN CHURCH, IT DON'T HAVE TO BE IN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU COME IN CHURCH, YOU GET EQUIPPED. You come in church, you get empowered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What is manifestation? Making known. Oh, glory to God. And as we grow from Lutheran age, Baptist age, Methodist age, Pentecostal age, we are right up to the capp stone, waiting, longing for that captain stone to set down in the building. The Bible said we're living in the last days, the top of the pyramid, the crossfishes of cancer age. Coming the time of Leo the lion. Oh my, where are we at? We are the right watch. We are coming at the the time of the coming of Leo the lion, the captain stone. So that's why when the thunders came, the land roar, &gt;&gt; it was the end of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when the angel swore, time shall be no longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was time itself runs out. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, he's coming. Behold, I send Elijah watch before the terrible day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Elijah come to close off the age. Introduce a bright age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is a short time? &gt;&gt; This age is one of the shortest age. &gt;&gt; A short time &gt;&gt; because they getting darker and darker and darker &gt;&gt; according to the prophecy of Isaiah. Gross darkness cover the earth. &gt;&gt; Go around put by faith a little light to represent you. &gt;&gt; The bright coming forth. Remember all the homosexuals, all the sodommites, they're increasing in strength and power. They're growing in recognition and everything else. They're legalizing them and everything else. All that is a sign. The Bible said nothing happened yet until the iniquities of the Amorites are full. So God waiting until the cup full to make his move. He waiting for you to make your move. To make it to make his move. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Everything have to have its place. Sodomites have to have his place. Lot the lukewarm church member have his place. And Abraham the elect WITH THE ANGEL HAVE TO have his place also. &gt;&gt; Do you SEE IT? &gt;&gt; SODOM CONDITION RETURN &gt;&gt; AS prophesied as was days of Noah. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. So we are back in Noah's day. &gt;&gt; We are back in those days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit that was back there is back here &gt;&gt; and they having a time. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God. So we in the days of the capp stone in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God we are right at the end time. You believe in dispensations Bible said in dispensation of the fullness of time. What is the fullness of time? There have been dispensation of the Mosaic law, dispensation of John the Baptist. There was the dispensation of Christ. There's a dispensation of church organization. There's a dispensation of the of the Holy Spirit. Now is the dispensation of adoption. What the world is waiting and groaning. When the fullness of time comes, when the dispensation of the fullness of time, what is the fullness of time? When the dead rises, &gt;&gt; when the sickness ceases, when all the earth ceases to grown, the fullness of the dispensation of time. Tell me, my brother, when was there a time that the sons of God was to be manifested outside of this time? Now when there was a time in history that this was a manifestation the time to deliver all nature nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation which I believe will be in the fullness &gt;&gt; of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now all things have been brought coming up chap to headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back. Here we go. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly. &gt;&gt; Amen. until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and the church together. &gt;&gt; This have nothing to do with this pastor fighting this pastor, this church fighting this church group and church war, which is foolishness, which is all over the message. We're not talking about that. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the ministry becoming so much like Christ. &gt;&gt; Not so much like a politician. &gt;&gt; No, so much evil &gt;&gt; and sewing down the people with nasty seeds. Not that. That's not Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is human. &gt;&gt; That is natural. Okay. The spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till we join him and the church together. &gt;&gt; The church. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Throw in the next gear. We got to go now. I can't finish it right now. &gt;&gt; This is the last before the con convention and we have no communion service next &gt;&gt; this evening. So it's one service. &gt;&gt; So we making a combine. &gt;&gt; All right. The church, the church is supposed to be predestinated into into the adoption of children where God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; God could adopt a man and give him something. &gt;&gt; God could adopt Anthony O'Brien here, brother Anthony, and give him something. &gt;&gt; What's the first thing you do? Not the second or third. The first thing to do, he said the first thing try that &gt;&gt; see if it's right. &gt;&gt; So my brother get some kind of power whatnot and he come and my job is to &gt;&gt; try that. &gt;&gt; And if he don't want me to try it, we know something little wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say come, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, &gt;&gt; bring it and come bring it to the pastor and come. &gt;&gt; He said I'm not bringing it. Go with it. Wherever it come from, go back with it. &gt;&gt; Because if you have it and it right, you're not afraid to bring it and come. &gt;&gt; When the Lord tell me, don't tell nobody about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go back with it. &gt;&gt; Lord, I tell you that, brother. He said, bring it and come. &gt;&gt; That's the authority to try it first. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; See if it is right. &gt;&gt; If it is right, we thank God for it. Move right with it. &gt;&gt; But we have to try it. So any minister say you have to take it and and rebuke you because you you're questioning me. You're questioning me. Yes, I'm questioning you. &gt;&gt; Don't question me. Don't question me. What do you mean don't question me? Is it the word of Pentecostal age? You know &gt;&gt; this is sharp like a razor. You know I am here not only to question but to challenge you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PAUL SAID, "IF a angel come from heaven, &gt;&gt; marches from the pulpit, &gt;&gt; IF A ANGEL COME FROM HEAVEN AND preach any other gospel, &gt;&gt; crack the box shuttle, &gt;&gt; let him be accursed." &gt;&gt; Don't even question him. Just crack and shoot, you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, because that DEMON WANT TO DESTROY YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WORD IS DESTRUCTIVE. &gt;&gt; A FALSE TEACHING, FALSE DOCTRINE IS DESTRUCTIVE. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL INTRODUCED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH, GOD SAID YOU SHALL NOT SURELY DIE. GOD DID NOT SAY THAT. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID YOU SHALL SURELY DIE. &gt;&gt; DEVIL TWISTED. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TWIST NO WORD. WE COME TOO FAR TO TURN BACK NOW. &gt;&gt; WE COME TOO FAR TO BRING STRANGE FIRES. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Too far to bring some offering of strange fire. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, so watch now. Watch this man claim a certain thing. Try it. See if it's right. If it's right, move right with it and say, "Lord, send us something else." Keep moving on. Watch until everything take its place. Every fellow take his place. That is when the Philistines go to backing up. Shorts will go off. Hair will go down. Face will be washed. Single will be missing. That's right. When the church begins to get into his mighty power, when they'll have a nasty safar few of them, you will see that holy church stand together in its power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God. POWERFUL CHURCH STANDING THERE. &gt;&gt; That is what he's coming for. &gt;&gt; What he's coming for a powerful church. &gt;&gt; Not no flimsy church. Not no wimpest church. Not no cified church. A powerful church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man and woman know how to pray, &gt;&gt; know how to call upon God, know to shake themselves and get out of the way. &gt;&gt; That's a real gift when you could get out of the way. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Look, I'm going to skip here. We should be so on fire for God. We should be going day and night. Nothing should be able to stop us. We should be so sweet, so pleasant, so kind, so Christlike in our lives. It takes an everyday life." &gt;&gt; Let's take these three words again. &gt;&gt; So sweet. I hear that they're like 116. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sweet. &gt;&gt; After service, I'll give you the honey. Take take two dose. Drink it and go make it sweet. But that's how you have to be. So sweet. &gt;&gt; So pleasant. &gt;&gt; There are some people so unpleasant. They look unpleasant. They carry the self unpleasant. The way they look, you want to talk to them. They're so unpleasant. A smile has go a long way, you know. &gt;&gt; I hear that better the be muscles. It's easier to smile and to frown. You take the pressure to frown, you know. So you pushing a hard face because you won't talk to you and what. But if you ease up on things, it will ease your stress when you smile. &gt;&gt; It's a healthy thing to smile, you know. You don't know you light up somebody day, you know. &gt;&gt; Beam them smile. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Remember when I come back my grandson Grace and I knock on the door and knock on the door and he be there looking forward and he be smile. He know his mother going to open that door and when she open that door he just beam that smile. She has to smile. &gt;&gt; He is waiting with that smile. He's waiting. He's just waiting expectation with that smile. That's why you must come to service &gt;&gt; under a smile of worship, a thanksgiving to God, a gratefulness and whatn not. You don't come back. You come with your shoulders hope like that. You come you raise back. You shake back your shoulders. This is the place to ease the pressure. &gt;&gt; Don't come here to get pressure. Please, please stay home. Stay back. Go back. &gt;&gt; Here's the place to ease tension. &gt;&gt; Like a back boat. Here's the place of easy tension. &gt;&gt; Pressure you pressing your job. Pressure when you come here. Oh my. So good to be here. Hallelujah. Isn't Jesus sweet, sweet, sweet? You can make a song on that one. Jesus so sweet. How sweet song. Hallelujah. Why? You're coming to worship God. Praise God. And God could say in heaven, "Look at my people down there. They're under trials. They're not testing, but they're worshiping me. They love me. I have to do something for them. I have to bless them. My God, look how they love me. I send them some through the waters. I send some through the flood. I send some through the fire. But all them come through the blood. But look at them. All them praising me. Some in the lion's den. Some the fiery furnace. Some through high trials. Some lose this and lose that. But they love me anyhow." Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. then become a love of fear. Then you have no fear in your spirit and your heart for the future. You're not living by anxiety. You're not living biting your nails. You have confidence in your God. He brought you out all these years. He took you through up the mountain down the valley. When you was in a hell hole, he pulled you out your hell hole. He set your foot upon a rock. He deliver you from this. He deliver from that. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. You deliver one child. One child get back bound. He deliver next child. Praise God. But he's showing you that he could deliver. YOU YOU YOU had testimony before. You see the power of God come upon them. If it come upon once, it could come back again. Come on. If it hit you once, it can hit you again. COME ON, SAY AMEN, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; IF FIRE STRUCK YOU BEFORE, IT COULD STRIKE YOU AGAIN. &gt;&gt; It takes a everyday life to have this kind of life. &gt;&gt; Not a Sunday life, a everyday life to pressing your way as a Christian. God is calling his children aside by manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't have to say one word about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No paper testimony necessary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So kind, so Christlike, God calling his children aside by manifestation. They don't have to say one word about it. You see something happen positionally placed sons of God. God getting into him into order exactly with the same thing. And he just has as much authority. His word is just as good as an archangel. Even better. The son was adopted, put on a high place, set out there, change his robes, change his colors. The father of ceremony. This is my son from henceforth. He's governor. He's ruler. He's over all my heritage. All I have belongs to him. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the reason the coming of the seals. At the finishing of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is, what he is, how he lives, his nature, his being. You are supposed to be all the way up there by that time &gt;&gt; to bring us into the full stature of the sons of daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Can you come right back to the mystery of the seventh seal and under the seventh seal have seven thunders and he said WE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL THE WAY UP THERE BY THAT TIME. ALL THEM VIRTUES supposed to be in there BY THAT TIME. WHAT TIME? THE FULLNESS OF TIME. &gt;&gt; And when the FULLNESS TIME HAVE COME, IT'S TIME TO SEE THE manifestation &gt;&gt; of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; We are waiting on it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Seventh seal, brother now for the end time message. This seal. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He revealed all the six seals. But he don't say nothing about the seventh. &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal is for the end message. &gt;&gt; First four seals history also. Fifth seal ses on the altar. Fourth seal be system and so on. Sixth seal earthquake. Seven seal silence. &gt;&gt; It don't say nothing about the seventh seal, but the end time seal when it starts &gt;&gt; will be a total secret. &gt;&gt; Only when it starts, &gt;&gt; but at the finishing, &gt;&gt; we just read that &gt;&gt; you're supposed to be way up the road. Now, &gt;&gt; all faith and virtue, knowledge, and temperance at the finishing. &gt;&gt; What is this for? The top of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; When the pyramid comes to it stop, &gt;&gt; we are at the end time, the opening of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So when he made man a god, he gave him a domain. As the domain goes from sea to sea, from shore to shore, he had control over it. And Jesus came being the one without sin. He proved it. When the winds blowed, he said, "Peace be still." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it was more than talk. He proved it by manifestation. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Then he said, "If you shall say to this mountain, be moved. Don't doubt you shall have what you says." So go back to Genesis. Now the world and nature is groaning, moving for what? For the manifestation of the sons of God. When true sons, born sons, fil sons speak and their word is backed. I believe on the it's on the bord of it. Now say this mountain and brother desire so and so I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. &gt;&gt; From future home I'm almost done. Now in Ephesians 1:10 he said you put it down. It's called the fullness of time. It's it's called not the seven days. It's called the fullness of time. When the fullness of time has come when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity. After the seven church age is over, Luther's age is over, Methodist is over, Pentecostal age is over. Now you're going to what? Eternity. No more servants, no more trees, no more other than eternity. Oh my. That is where the fullness time is at. Give me a church. Oh, we said that. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So this coming of the stone, I'm going to close up music, please. The coming of the stone upr glory because it ended the gentile dispensation. God ended it up with the coming of that stone. So friends, the coming of the capstone ends this gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; And the capstone is in two parts. Revelation and manifestation. Oh, I'll close with this. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my my my &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the only way, okay, Jesus said the message is to go to all the world. Then at the end shall be after this message go to all the world. And the only way that God can preach the gospel today is through that lump of clay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God can't preach the gospel through mechanical tape. He had to preach it through lumps of clay, dust, men. And that's the reason you sick people had the right to come and say, "Lord Jesus, if you only heal me now, I may not be a preacher. I'll talk about it. I'll do everything I can. You are the vine. I'm one of the branches." And so forth. Okay. Now, let's go on. Let's go further now. In order to preach the gospel, before you can make it a gospel preach, you have got to have power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To prove the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The letter killth. and the but the spirit maketh alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the gospel is truly the gospel when it is preached in power and demonstration. Could we all stand and give God some praises as we worship the Lord? And brother Anthony going to lead us in some songs and we're going to close. Oh, praise the Lord. Let's all stand and give God some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise this morning. Oh hallelujah. Do you love him today? Oh, glory be to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. This is my season. Oh, this time. And with my hands lifted. [Music] Oh, and my ad bound. Sweet Holy Spirit. Oh, fill me now. Oh, sweet Holy Spirit. Oh, let's lift our hand and sing.

You're going to be sealed. You're going to be anointed. The backsliders will come back. Oh, how the gospel will be preaching its power. There will be a revival. The sick sick will be healed. The blind will see. The will walk. Oh, hallelujah. It'll be rag jamming time. It'll be a short time, but it will be here. Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe it today? Why don't you turn around, preach your brother, preach your sister, and share a blessing with somebody. Amen. Amen. We have a more sure word of prophecy this morning.

We pray that you the judge of all things will judge rightly this morning and give every to every man and every woman their blessing this morning according to their offering and tithes, Lord. father an offering this morning. Lord, we pray you bless each heart here today. May your presence and anointing go with each one. And may you bless the ministry by these things, Lord, as we use these things for the honor and glory of God and the kingdom of God. In Jesus name we pray and ask it. Amen. And amen. Praise God. As they hand it out, oh, have you been baptized into the body? baptized with the Holy Ghost. Oh, there is but one way to enter in it just as they take on Pentecost. Oh, so are you in the church triumphant? Oh, are you in the Savior's front? Come and be. Come and be baptized into the body. Oh, and forever more abide. Oh, there is but one church bride or body.

You appreciate the message today. You appreciate your pastor. You appreciate the word. My, it felt fresh. And I think this was in 2017, I believe it was. So, you see how God could preserve food for us. That's present tense redemption. &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Amen. Uh we have two notes of praises and a prayer request. Our first note of praise is from brother Hugh Williams. Thanking God for being able to come out today and to be back in fellowship, my family and I. So we are so grateful. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? And brother Hugh, we are looking for God to complete to complete a perfect healing, to complete a perfect work, not many days hence. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Amen. Not just for brother Hugh, but for every single person that's sick. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham taught us, he said, "How could you have faith for a rapture if you can't have faith for divine healing?" So divine healing is on the journey to the rapture. This body has got to be changed. Hallelujah. You got to believe it. You got to claim it. You got to speak it. You got to walk in it like Abraham and stagger not at the promise of God. Because it is a promise of God that you are supposed to be healed. Not just healed, delivered. Not just delivered, sealed all the way until your redemption. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have another note of praise. This is from uh brother and sister Sabu. Uh this month marks a milestone for us in this ministry. 31 years. Wow. That's tremendous. We would like to thank brother and sister oid for their dedication and caring abilities to brother Oid. It was uh tough in the beginning but when I learned your ways it was smooth sailing. But over is not in the house today. But I got to got to make sure he sees this. Once I learned your ways, it was smooth sailing. May God bless you and bless us all together as we press into the coming of the Lord. Brother and Sister Sabo, we appreciate that. You know, one thing about you know, he's he's a he's a sword fighter. He doesn't he doesn't play around. It can be rough around the edges, but once it happens, you learn his ways, then it's smooth sailing. You know, he believes in saying it direct, saying it the way it meant to be said, you know, and we appreciate him for that. He appreciate your pastor. Amen. We do have a prayer request at this time from brother Popwell for John Knight's salvation of his soul. A total healing of his prostate gland which is reading I think it's 100 g and is very much swollen. A biopsy test is needed to determine if it's cancerous. He has lost a lot of weight and unable to walk properly because one of his legs has no strength and he may have to do a hip replacement. So quite a lot here. But our God is able. He's more than able in fact. And if you have a request today that you want to bring to the throne of grace as we approach the Lord this morning by raising hands. and those in the sanctuary. Maybe you're downstairs, maybe you are connected online, wherever you might be this morning and you have a need for whatever it might be, our God is more than able to minister this morning. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we have seen so many requests become notes of praise, Lord. Lord, and Lord, the pastor was preaching about how Lord, you bypassed the process when you were there at the wedding of Kaa and they said the wine ran out. You didn't ask for grapes. You didn't ask for where can we set this up. You said just pour water, Lord. And you bypassed the process the prophet brought out, Father. Lord, you are more than able to do a work of transformation to bypass the process. We are believers that missing limbs could be restored. We are believers that the God who created is able to restore and replace and reset and remove. And Lord, so we come today, Lord, with our hearts, with our faith and expectation, knowing that you've done it before and you're able to do it again. Lord, we pray for John Knights, Lord, for the salvation of his soul, for the total healing of the prostate gland condition, Lord, that the test, Lord, would come back negative, Lord. That even as this prayer will go forth, he would be completely healed, Lord. That you would regulate what need to be regulated. You would fix what need to be fixed. you would restore what needs to be restored. And for every hand that was raised all over the sanctuary, Lord, my hands are raised also, Lord. Raise downstairs, raise on the internet, you know, every need, every cry, Lord. Every sick person in our midst, everyone that's connected to us that we love that's being affected to know that that's the reason you came, Lord. You not now healing, but healing already took place, Father. And by your stripes, we are healed. We walk in faith and confidence Lord knowing that you are more than able to deal with every situation. So father Lord we commit your people into your hands Lord. We pray for every brother every sister. Lord we lift up our pastor before you Lord flying back from the meetings in India Lord. Lord may give him traveling mercies and bring him back to us in health and strength. May you bless all the officers. May you bless the believers. May you bless everyone that's here Lord. May you grant traveling mercies, Lord. May you bless the baptism service after Lord this service. Lord, may you anoint the the the the young people in a special way to take the step if they have not taken that step already. And may you take the church from strength to strength. We pray in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; And the church says, "Amen." You may be seated for a few announcements. Firstly, I'd like to welcome Rondell Allen. Good to see you, brother Rondell. It's been it's been quite some time. Happy to have you here. I see invited by sister Dborah. Uh welcome. I know Rondell well. May God bless you richly. Certainly happy to have you here. Jayen, so good to see you as well. And uh we are so happy to be able to come to the house of God. You have to see this as the most important decision, the most important appointment. Because when there are things that you think you need to do and you need to sort out and you need to fix and man could only do so much, but when God gets involved in the matter, then it could be completely resolved. It could be completely dealt with. And the word says to seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and everything else you could ever look for. Anything else you could ever ask for will be taken care of. So, we are so happy. Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Amen. And do remember the pastor. He's on his way back. I think one of the flights is a 14-hour flight. If you have ever flown, a 14-hour flight is like, Lord, help us. But may God give him strength as he returns to us by tomorrow. Lord willing, he should be back into the country. So we thank God. So we are very happy. We have a baptism service after this service. Brother Andrew Henry, young brother Andrew Henry. He might be downstairs. He's going to be baptized. We are so happy. I had the opportunity to interview him uh for this last week and I said to his father afterwards, "He reminds me of me when I was young as a young boy. He has a heart for the Lord and the Lord has been dealing with him and he has had some experiences and that's a really tremendous thing." Brother Brandham said, "You make yourself when you're young." And the best and greatest decision you could ever make is to serve the Lord while you're young. So, we are so happy. We are overjoyed to see a young man in such a time as this make a decision. I want to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, and when I asked him why you want to do this because we don't want to get baptized because other people get baptized. Why do you want to do this? We want you to answer from your own mouth with with your parents not there. It was just him and I alone tustling to see why you want to do this and he had an answer. You know, he really want to serve the Lord. So, we are happy about that. So, we encourage you to join us for the baptism service after the service today. Service continues this coming Wednesday here at the tabernacle. Come under great expectation. We're looking for God to do something tremendous. This coming Friday, we'll have our Zoom prayer meeting. Be present. Be active. Looking for God to do something. God operates when we pray. We have to understand that prayer is an invitation into this terrestrial realm. We will remember that when Daniel was praying, the angel was fighting and the moment Daniel stopped praying, the angel stopped fighting. So I want us to recognize that the access that God has into our jurisdiction is open by the channel of prayer. So I want to encourage you, don't take it lightly. And prayer is not just a prayer meeting thing. It's a way of life. It's something you do in the morning. It's something you do in the evening, something you do in the day, and it's something should should be to practice the presence of God. And this coming Sunday, we have our double service this coming Sunday, Lord willing. And um these are the final, this one and the one in December, Lord willing, will be the final two for this year. And I believe I was preaching recently and speaking about do this in remembrance of me. It's a command from the Lord. It's not an option. And if you are a believer, this is something that you want to be here for. So we encourage you to make every effort to be in the house of the Lord next been faithful at this mission. We certainly appreciate you very much. Can we put our hands together for the cleaning crews and the different teams? It's on a roster. It's on a rotation. So the work is supposed to be shared. But I do know there are some believers who it doesn't matter what group is serving. They actually join because they have a heart for the things. So, we want to appreciate you very much uh for that support and we want to encourage you uh this is our church. You know, we all wear different hats and responsibilities and we encourage you to be able to support in some way. Next week, Lord willing, group one, which is what the Pop Wells group will be carded to serve. We would have announced last Sunday that our end of year church dinner is scheduled for December the 20th. It'll be Saturday, December the 20th at 5:00 p.m. We want to invite the entire church to participate. The menu is downstairs. They have withheld it from me because normally I would stand here and read it, but they're trying to protect you and protect me at this point. So, I was told here the menu is downstairs. So, we all have to go see it afterwards. But I I um I have a note. It is an attractive menu. Delicious food. So adults 150 and children uh I think this will be $80 and under five will be free. So I mean this is a fantastic cost, fantastic fellowship, attractive menu, delicious food. I'm quoting from the note that I have here. So we looking forward to see the entire church being present for our end of year dinner on December the 20th. It's an opportunity to have fellowship. People do all kind of thing on their work and their job and thing. This is our thing. So we doing we want to do our thing to the best of our ability. All right. So we want to encourage you to be there to be present by the grace of God and God's willing as well the weekend before of the 13th and 14th. We uh intend to have a foreign minister here to speak for us on the Saturday and two services on the Sunday. as we look by the grace of God to close out this year strong by the grace of God. So stay on fire, stay in the spirit and we are looking for God to continue to bless us richly. So may the Lord richly bless you, brother Anthony. Amen. Do you love the Lord today? Praise God. As you get ready to leave, Amen. As he ushers getting ready to dismiss you out. Amen. Let's sing that song. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
