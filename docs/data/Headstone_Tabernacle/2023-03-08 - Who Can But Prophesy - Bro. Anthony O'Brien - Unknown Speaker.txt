praise God so let's turn to all Bibles now amen as we get ready switch over thank you again to the word portion of service and this is if you want to see what the Lord will do for us this evening amen priest come on just give me a second here amen praise God if I could just have a little bit more on the monitors praise God amen hallelujah do you love him this evening amen praise God praise God okay so scriptures amen certain apologize for that it's not a bit of technical difficulty there Amos we want to go to the Book of Amos and the Old Testament and two scriptures in the New Testament would be second Peter 1 and Revelation 10 I want to read from tonight just to get our contacts for a little message here praise God you see what the Lord will speak to us amen Amos chapter 3 and you want to read from verse one amen praise God Amos chapter 3 from verse 1 says Hear this word that the Lord had spoken against you o children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I'll punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he had taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord had not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath Ron who will not fear the Lord God had spoken who can but prophesy amen a second scripture we take from second Peter chapter one and skipping on to verse 19 it says we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineeth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen amen last scripture you want to read now from Revelation 10 and we know this praise God but we wanna amen look at it again and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven close to the clown a rainbow appalls upon his head and his face was as with the sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voices when a lion roared when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him not live it forever and ever who created heaven and the things that they're in all on the earth and the things that they're in on the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant to the prophets The Voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and Kings may God have blessing to the reading of his word delicious bow heads and praise one more time o Heavenly Father Lord we thank you to be in your house this evening and Lord we hear Lord not by chance but Lord your voice has called us to this age to this moment to this time and this last day Lord father we stand here by the grace of almighty God now father we pray Lord that the same voice that called us Lord father Lord mayor Place us Lord father positionally Lord father Lord may I continue to draw us closer to you Lord and Lord we pray Lord as for a few moments Lord as we get into the scriptures there God father we pray Lord that your holy presence would come down and anoint it and Inspire to our hearts are fresh Lord we could read the word any man could read your word Lord but when the spirit come and breathe life upon it oh it makes all the difference Lord father your anointing makes all the difference Lord father Lord father and do our work among us tonight as Lord as we just yield yourself now to to your will and prom uh purpose tonight have your way in US Lord we pray and ask it in Jesus name amen and amen praise God you can turn only monitors a bit more he can obviously tonight amen thank you so much God bless you amen amen praise God glory to God amen hallelujah it's up a little bit amen praise God just getting comfortable here amen praise God you love him tonight amen amen well I have a title tonight my title is who can but prophesy amen and amen who can but prophesy praise God and I have a little brain map here that uh it's a lot of stuff and I said to try to jot it down as the inspiration came so it just all kind of fit on one sheet so I walk at my sheet amen because I didn't want to miss anything praise God if God reveal it then I feel it has to be spoken amen so as disconnected that and connect to that and I also have lines all over here praise God but amen I'm praying for the wisdom of God to put it together amen and that God would bless our hearts this evening amen but it's nothing new praise God there's nothing new Under the Sun praise God it's the same word and God is going to make it more positive Amen brother Shane does a little bit more on the monitors amen glory to God so my title this evening again as I said who can but prophesy amen so we're talking about prophecy praise God him as Narayan and this I have is actually in four parts here amen um uh four parts of this thought right and I'm just going to kind of give a quick breakdown because I feel I may not get to it if I get to ahead of myself even praise God but uh amen praise God bless bless God Amen you know the prophet talked about prophecy isn't that right and he said to prophesy means to tell of an experience or to foretell something that's fixing to take place amen isn't that right prophecy is from the very mouth of God himself praise God and whatever is spoken is of words of God from the very thoughts of God in other words he was thinking it in his mind before it was spoken he was thinking it in his mind before it was said but it's not good for just for it to remain in his head or for it to remain it is mine he had to express his thoughts he had to express what was going to happen or what was going to take place and that expression is what come from thought to word so when we have the word of God as we have tonight what we have is the very thoughts of God Express oh isn't that right and the word of God concerning you is the thoughts of God expressed concerned in your life concerning who you are concerning what you are to do who you are to be or everything in your life or everything is ordained of God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord there's nothing that happens that God doesn't know about there's nothing that happens that God has not foreseen there's nothing new Under the Sun God never has an aha moment God never has a oops I made a mistake that's not how God operates he lives in an infinite World he is an infinite Corps oh isn't that right we are just finite beings isn't that right that's why we need Revelation because Revelation is when God reveals to us something that was hid in his mind she from before the beginning God had in his mind Eternal thoughts concerning you in his mind he saw you heal in his mind he saw you delivered in his mind he saw you restored in his mind he saw you receiving the Holy Ghost in his mind he saw the devil defeated in his mind he saw you defeating the devils in his mind he saw you running out the squatters in his mind he saw you as a warrior you were conquer us to him that loved us unto him that called us from the beginning for who he found you he called and who he called it Justified and who he justified tonight he has already glorified somebody say Amen tonight oh there's a prophecy concerning your life that prophecy cannot fall to the ground my words shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I shed forth for it to be accomplished the word of God has already been spoken and when I'm nippled and speaks the miraculous must take place oh oh is anybody hearing me tonight oh there is a word concerning you tonight I don't care how many tea rooms there are I don't care how many temples they are in the universe they cannot stop the purpose of God it cannot stop the prophecy of God in that prophecy you're gonna be perfected in that prophecy go to a church the prophets or church Martin and Seb Marching In humility only without a blemish without a spot walking in righteousness walking in Holiness walking in Purity only five lives that's who you are tonight oh I am who God says I am somebody say amen I am who God said I am not what the devil says you are forget about the devil forget about his mind forget about his thoughts God has thoughts towards you tonight oh oh you don't hear me tonight oh man four parts of this first part I have is revelation so prophecy now this is the Eternal mind of God his thoughts concerning you from that he could prophesy but you and your finite mind can't catch up with that you can never understand that praise God because his daughter infinite man's taught in the morning if it blossomed by the evening time it perishes that is that is not God's thoughts God's daughter from eternity to Eternity there is no end to it Hallelujah when he thought about you he loved you when he thought about you he wrote your name in blood whatever could stop that whatever could break that whatever could break that contract that Covenant that God has with you oh God always keeps his word he always keeps his appointments he always keeps his agreements because he is called and he gets the ability to keep his agreement be promised to deliver you then he's going to deliver you if he promised to restore you that he's going to restore you then not enough devils in hell that could stop that God the devil is already defeated once God opens his mouth oh oh the devil is already defeated what God opens his mouth oh you don't hear me tonight [Applause] you know you have a you don't even have to do nothing all you have to do is speak a word the Bible says the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things will challenge you out that appear in front of us were made by things that you cannot see there's a higher there's a bigger place on this more real than this and the world was framed by the word of God therefore anything you need to match anything you desire if you have faith to reach up and believe that there is a God out there somewhere who put this whole thing together has the ability to speak into your life oh to heal you to deliver you to restore you to set the captain free he could create a new kidney he could create spleen liver he's a creator of all things oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man [Applause] do you believe that tonight so revelation Revelation is prevailing power isn't that right the Gates of Hell will come against it but the promises they will not prevail oh they may shake it they may scream at it they may Pelt bombs at it but not no weapon formed against it can prosper because they cannot Prevail oh Hallelujah cancer kicked against revelation hey man's not right Hallelujah Deuteronomy 29 29. the secret things belonging to the Lord oh God but those things which are revealed belong to us those things that are revealed belong to you don't let the devil steal your joy if God reveal you your joy just Joy no man give you my joy no man take from you the devil's a liar tonight you were supposed to have joy you are you supposed to be able to smile in the midst of your trial that he and his wisdom send your way to test your spirits to see if you really come from God to prove to the devil who you are in this evil age that could send a pride on the earth to stand every trial stand every test stand every circumstance though the flood come this way though the fire come that way God put something in our hearts tonight that's the reason I came here that's reason I made it because God put us faith in us the standard tests somebody say Amen Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh I need a pride to answer answer the call tonight who cannot promise her all right after I have to build into this yeah all right but those things are revealed belong to us and talk children forever and ever that we may do all the words of this law so how could you even do the words if it isn't revealed to you how can you even know what to do if you had the trumpet turn on a certain sound how are you gonna prepare yourself for that battle isn't matter ash you gotta know what it is therefore Revelation has got to come to you to open your mind up as to what God's desire is and so what God's requirement is so that you can even fulfill it so even to come into that prophecy it takes a revelation Hallelujah isn't that right Revelation what God reveals to us in his word It's New to You but it's not new to God he always noticed it always was he just peel it back a little bit to show you what it was and now that you see what it was it gives you Faith to stand it gives you Faith to speak it gives you Faith because Revelation opened up something to you Flesh and Blood didn't reveal it to you but it was caught and reveal it to you Flesh and Blood can't reveal this word they have the word and books and tips but they're not Revelation that's why there's so many divisions among us because the teachers like the Revelation to rightly uh uh speak the word isn't that right and teach it praise God isn't that right so because misrepresented some people say this and say that but the word Still Remains true praise God with the right Revelation with the right interpretation praise God you could have whatever God has promised for you you could step right into the prophecy with the right revelation oh I'm gonna get to it praise God hopefully you get it tonight amen all right Revelation so it's four parts it's Revelation I have faith then vision and then prophecy isn't that so we start a revelation that's our first part here right nothing new Under the Sun it's not right and Thy Word of Lord has settled Heaven forever that's what David said isn't that right in the Psalms it's not it is God showing us revealing to us something that always was in his mind and then Revelation is what gives you faith but Revelation is Faith isn't that right a previously hidden truth now they finally revealed to you who you are who God is and who the devil is oh hallelujah hallelujah so you're not standing on your own thoughts not standing on your own ideas that's not what brought us all this long way when we look back 50 plus years in this message after the prophet left many came and many left but you are still here that's something that God put inside of you you couldn't do that yourself some seeds fell by the wayside some seeds fell upon thorny but some of those seeds fell upon good ground God knows who the good Crown is so he sold the seed confidently knowing that you had a heart you had the right attitude to receive the word of God for your day oh and now that you've received it what is the secrets the word is in the bride now that word is inside of you oh and the devil is too late oh he's trying to teacher try to make you depressed frustrated try to kill you try to cut you off but what he cannot remove is The Incorruptible seed that is inside of your soul and God's Gonna pour down fire in this age now and ignite the word caught inside of you ignite that word see it inside of you and make it come to life highest coming tonight there is a prophecy of Dynamics hanging over the bride hanging over you tonight hanging over you don't you fail reach up and grab it tonight every promise every Divine promise of God will come to pass oh can we say man Hallelujah my God hallelujah I'm still so inspired my brother give you Robert service hey man faitha unlock the promises of God Amen it's still ringing in my ears hey man that was really tremendous praise God I'm actually drawing some of this inspiration from that day amen amen so so thankful to the Lord amen praise God that God has his love gifts huh amen amen praise God super thank God so see it's God showing to us somebody always was in his mind another Revelation gives you feet it's not right and what is Faith Hebrews 11 the evidence of Things Not Seen holders to the prophecy come a lot of the times they come at a time when you can't see it but it's still true a lot of the times a prophecy come and you cannot receive it because if you judge with your eyes you'll get very discouraged if you use your hands your Victory discouraged because it goes past the five senses it have nothing to do with what you could feel what you could smell what you could touch God told Abraham I'm gonna give you a son oh walk before me I'm beat up perfect oh Hallelujah I'll make you a father of Nations you're gonna bring forth a son oh and in that situation his wife was apparent is not his wife and when past the age of childbearing that situation seemed impossible but when God speaks something I don't care what is in your mind I don't care what is your situation I don't care what you're facing what you're going through God has spoken a word over here and everything has got to line up with the spoken word of God oh Hallelujah because that's how the world was created oh it's not right there was Darkness everywhere there was confusion everywhere but God didn't stop to have a conversation with the darkness God invited with the darkness he didn't quarrel in the darkness he just speak and he said let there be light and there was light and tonight God is speaking into your situation he's speaking into your circumstance he's speaking past your Darkness his hand is not too short that he cannot reach you and pull you out of whatever you are in tonight there is no place God can't go there's nothing God can do to save your soul if you have to cut through 10 million Devils he's coming after you tonight I don't care what it is he's coming after your soul somebody get along a shot of prey give him praise tonight Hallelujah Gloria Carr oh my God oh Hallelujah you got to forgive me amen if I act a little crazy but I had the real problems keeping this in my heart keeping us in my spirit every time it's come to me any car I want to jump and Shout but he's saying we will go like this and the guy behind me on what's going on there praise God so I had to keep it together but I have to get here tonight to speak this word to you prophecy prophecy that's coming for the pride prophecy I shout forward my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost what is it prophecy prophecy The Pride tonight is getting ready to connect with her prophecy her word for her tail her word for her time a word for a season the prophet said after a while she's gonna find where it is written and she's gonna anoint that word to herself walk in it believe it speak hats somebody say man oh Hallelujah give him a shot of praise [Applause] [Music] all right whoa [Music] one of the big secrets to this is that it has to be spoke it has to be spoken it has to be expressed God loved you but he loved you so much that it was bubbling over in his heart when he thought about you so he had to speak it he had to say something he had to do something about his love he had to do something about the thoughts that was in his mind so he spoke a word and that word and it's time and in its season it's gonna come into a manifestation and you are gonna be the expression of the thought that was in his mind all along oh Hallelujah I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be I'm coming on to something coming under something we Bypass or theophany we prolonged into sin tested tried God allowed all of that but the prophecy kind of come to pass and every day we're climbing every day we're pressing every day we're praying every day we're seeking we're dragging ourselves look ten thousand fall on my right side do a thousand follow my left I shall not be moved because God but God spoke has to come to pass Hallelujah Oh Glory according man [Music] mine Glory Glory oh my God hey glory is of Faith a revelation of his word fate always speaks to a future state which is prophecy it's not it connects with prophecy but you need it in order to connect a prophecy otherwise you'll be living in the flesh and he'd walk after the flesh walk after his own lust and so forth but he'd walk in this after the spirit they are the sons of God am as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God they speak my inspiration they become channels of communication for God to flow through them because they begin to think like God and act like God begin to line up with the things of God because there's a prophecy concerning them oh Hallelujah there was a prophecy concerning Mary isn't that right Mary is just carrying water Mary is just doing her part mayor's getting ready to be a sponsor Joseph she was getting on looked like life was getting better for her raise a pay and whatnot all of a sudden an angel come down from heaven to interrupt the flow to interrupt the program of things to bring up prophecy to bring our prophecy to shake up our world everything that happened after that angel came was turned on his head Hallelujah because prophecy here come to interrupt the program and prophecy it God sent unto us Elijah the prophets what for to turn our hearts back to the faith of Horrors prophecy therefore when that prophecy was released oh it had to find you it had to find me it had to find us it came and it interrupted our program interrupted Our Lives higher it found you on the streets it found you on the sidewalk it found you wherever it found you some of us in the Baptist methodists were over God found us and he put his word inside of us oh Hallelujah thank you [Music] not a devil could watch but he can't touch what God put inside of your heart what God put inside of your soul amen amen had to walk after his statues to do the will of God you're gonna come to that Amen to that Perfection isn't that right oh my okay state it is evidence of what you cannot see that is fake so I'm trying to connect it to the prophecy praise God because it's not just like misappropriated feet praise God like what you're talking about people have different kinds of feet on different levels some faith is unconscious you wake up in the morning you have faith to start your car whatever fate to tell your wife or your husband I'm coming back for you I'm coming back later this evening how do you know that that's a common Faith praise isn't that right but this Faith we're talking about here is to connect to our word from the Lord is to connect to a prophecy concerning you oh that's a feat we're talking about yesterday amen faith on the way so now watch so okay so part three here now vision right habakkuk 2 says for the vision is here for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie and though itari wait for it it will surely come it will not Tarry isn't that right that's God's Vision concerning you know when you get fatal Revelation that gives you vision it gives you focus it gives you purpose it makes you see what God is seeing concerning you you might be able to see everything but this one thing I see this one thing I have desired to make a church that will make a Revival we've got our eyes fixed on that core fixed on that Vision fix on that prophecy oh Holland there's not enough Devils that can take us out of that therefore everything we do is lined up with that Vision line up with that purpose line up with that objective we're not turning our eyes to the left we're not turning our eyes to the right God call us to make our church that will make a Revival so every prayer Our every efforts every time we come into this building every time we got it together for prayer it's to make a church that'll make a Revival the husbands will make that church the wives are going to make that church the young people make that church everything must line up with that call that we have set before us and we are going to run the race tonight the race that is set before us running towards it with all patience enduring all things parent all things open all things believe in all things believing not the same Lord Jesus Christ that baptized Peter and every upper room that Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on a day of Pentecost it's just as real tonight I'll tell you what I want it I want it tonight I want that sail baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that come down into my heart and burn out all the demons and forgot to set up a throne to sit on it in the throne room of my heart that's what I want tonight I hope that's what you want my brother I hope that's what you want my sister make your call in an election sure receive it a Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] oh I want the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost back in the church we need a Revival but guess what we have a prophecy oh hallelujah oh we have something a word from the Lord God tell us a prophet with a prophetic word for our faith to latch onto hey with a pit bull's feet with a bulldog locked your feet in the prophecy that he spoke oh concerning us and brother we are dead on the go aim and we are like Elisha tonight oh Hallelujah is not right I will not let you go I has lost soul level I will not leave you until I get my double portion you've got to come to that place because the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God is what would bring it to pass so every time you come into the presence of God the right mental attitude no right mental attitude you are nothing you came from nothing Hallelujah I don't know who I am anymore but God is everything to me he's a reason why I'm living he's a rock upon which

wary you feel you are an eagle tonight take your Eagle Peak and hook it into Mama Bird's promises oh God it's obligated to meet you on the basis of 10 promises he promises he promises he promises it he promises he promises he promises he promised to fill you he promises he promised to heal you he promises he promised he'd give you victory over the devil he promises he promised that every seed shall bring forth after its own kind he promised a passage shall possess the gates of the enemy that's a prophecy hanging over every seat Abraham hanging over every one of you inside of here possess the kids of the enemy Hallelujah [Music] oh my Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah it's a prophecy gotta be connecting with hallelujah we're not venturing out on our own assumptions hallelujah praise God on anything but we're holding on to his word because he promised he promised he would do it oh and God is guilty until he brings his promise to pass he is guilty of speaking a word and not fulfilling it if he don't bring it to pass so if God promised to heal you then hold to God's promise if God promises heal you then hold to that promise hold on like Jacob hold on hold on like Mary hold on hold on and wrestle hold on and stay there stay there all night long if you have to stay till the breaking of the day but I need somebody to cry how to admit I need somebody to press their oil with me if you know that God promised to do something for your family catch a person Let It Rock You In The Nights let it wake you up let it not catch you rest until God fulfill his promise Lord of Sanctified Lord I've done all I can but oh God I need the fire all things are ready let the fire pour oh my my [Music] hallelujah hallelujah who Glory Glory huh [Applause] my okay oh my time is running so prophecy isn't that right oh there's a prophecy over here you didn't know it all the time but it was over you then it's still over you now but what got you here won't get you there you need a little more faith to reach up and grab a hole and I promise so God speak a word to you and let you know the Time of the Season somebody's fixing to take place now your faith has something to hold on to the prophecy was always there but now it's revealed to you now it's made known to you like I was made known to Mary like I was made known to Simeon oh you shall not see that until you see the Lord's Christ save us made known to him now he had something to hold on to he never was going to see death but that prophecy was spoken over him and that anointed is fake to believe the god of the impossible would make his vision possible would make his Prophecy from the past so he went to the temple every day looking for his prophecy and tonight we come into the temple we come in on a Wednesday night this is where what you doing on a Wednesday people at home kicking back relaxing what you hear no ends there because you see your Birthright you gotta hold us something and something I got to get what I came for I'm thirsty I'm hungry I'm desperate I need something a little more than what I got in order to make it in this prophecy hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh Glory thank you oh you are blessed tonight you are highly favored to see what you see and to hear what you hear because feet come by here and here in the word of God you've got faith tonight the little remnants you know that there's a spirit out there waiting to catch you away that little bride she's waiting for her spirit her life to come to her brother Branham said no other life can work in this bride we need this life second one Peter Paul one through one four two seven that life has got to come into you that's the only life that we want to work with not a man's interpretation not a man's idea not a man's opinion but what the prophet revealed what was locked up in the mind of God is what is spoken over you tonight and by faith we are present towards it tonight we're pressing towards it we believe it with all our hearts amen okay [Music] so this is prophecy now Amos 38. amen God do nothing unless he Reveals His servants the prophets it's not right so it had to come spoken amen that's right through a prophet to reveal what it is that our faith had to connect to in order to bring it to pass amen it's not right I think it was in the prayer meeting but over talk about I'm wrong it's not like praying there seeking the Lord knowing that it was a promise that God promised their fathers he would send a deliverer and all of a sudden here come the vision here come the prophecy you're gonna bring forth a son and that that that Vision slid right into the prophecy praise God concerning the Redemption of the children of Israel unto their own land isn't that right oh man praise God hallelujah so that's another part to it now isn't that right we've got to cry out because the Bible said he heard the cries of his people now when Moses already born and he was 40 years in the wilderness isn't that right and he was sojourning there it seemed as though the prophecy would not come to pass because this deliverer That was supposed to come and save the people was out there lost and undone without God and his son isn't that he's kind of wandering to and fro praise God but when God looked at his watch he recognized that time had come for the deliverance and the cries of the children of Israel went up to the Heirs of God and he remembered the promise that he made to their father Abraham same with Almighty hand I'm gonna bring my people out into their own land a land flowing with milk and honey they're gonna possess the gates so when he saw that the time was ready Town come a burning bush God's Gonna interrupt the program interrupt the season interrupt what's taken place because the time of Deliverance has come and when your time of Deliverance has come God's Gonna Move doors he will open doors he will shut doors he will bring down kingdoms he will raise up Kings for his name's sake for the election shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do seeing that he is heir of the earth and tonight how can God hide from his elect what he's about to do seeing that you are going to Reign on the earth just like John said all in heaven heard our John praise God when he saw the things I will reveal in the book oh Hallelujah he jumped and he shouted you better jump and Shout tonight oh Hallelujah because it's coming oh Hallelujah all right we already read this now but I'm connecting I want to connect the prophecy now to this right okay so here it goes okay yeah so momentary consideration and show changes will prove how accurate this thought is right now Genesis 1 11 let every seat bring forth after its own kind isn't that right the seed was in the earth before the word came do you believe that because he speaks let every seat bring fought after his kind he's speaking to the seed therefore the seed was already there therefore when you command the Earth you have something in you praise God that he just had to speak over because the seed was already landed in you the seed Hallelujah in YouTube you are not a Believer but the word in you is a Believer pray the word that he puts in you from before the foundation of the world that's what he is connecting with when he speaks over you oh Hallelujah the potential to bring forth the word in your season to do what God says you're supposed to do and to manifest what God said you're supposed to manifest isn't that right oh my Hallelujah okay so so that's you so you got that right the seed is already in here it was already laying there and before God sent a message he had to have a people in the land to receive that message praise God and tonight there's another people in the land who under the messenger are gonna be the final voice to the final age praise God they'll have the voice of God in them praise God as a prophecy concerning you more prophecies praise or we're just going to keep prophesying tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man praise God so right so come after that quote now right now decent Church momentary consideration uh consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is and in the Dark Ages the world is almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards doctors and Creeds and not simple word oh so that's why God don't like this man-made thing oh fake leaves praise God that's what I keep doing and holy spirit kept moving out and trying to find somebody else that will surrender to his word that he can speak through because he has something to say and he can't have anything blocking or hindering the flow of God no man-made interpretation no man's ideas no man's opinions okay so you have to find channels that he could speak through and that's what he got in every age and in this age he's gonna find you pray somebody say Amen or unhindered you're gonna be a channel out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters even more work Sundays shall you do because I go unto my father they could no longer speak for God so then God said Wesley and he was a voice of the word in his day and so on and they keep happening right when the Methodist feel God raise up others and so on to go through all the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's a quote there now prophecy is always two things there's no the prophet and his prophecy what he actually says isn't that right the one who spoke it and the prophecy itself so therefore the word has to be spoken in order for it to be accomplished isn't that right Prophet said why are we not a nomination now then the circumcision of the Old Testament is in the flesh but in this new testament Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy he said another word prophecy doesn't mean to teach the prophecy means either to tell an experience on inspiration or foretell something that's fixing to take place amen and we have a prophet tonight who is God's mouthpiece malachite for William Brown of is Narayan and the prophecy which will be the word of God fulfills when it is fulfilled it's not right praise God so there's got to be a people that's gonna rise up under that messenger who will be the Fulfillment of the prophecy that was spoken that's why you are here tonight that's why you came through all that Darkness came through all those trials came through all those tests all those persecutions why so that you can fulfill prophecy oh somebody's got to do it some he's got to pray somebody's got to call upon God if not you then who if not here then where if not now then when oh come on brother I didn't come all this way just so occupy a church bench no no no no no no no I'm gonna press my will towards what God said because he promised it and he spoke it and the devil is already defeated he's a liar tonight everything I want God already has for me I just have to reach up and grab it and catch a hold of my promise for my day Hallelujah glory to God Amen so Elijah prophecy isn't that right it's what shut the heavens it's not right Elijah the Tish bite was of the inhabitants of Gilead reading the scripture here said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel live it before whom I stand there shall not be due or rain these years but according to my word oh isn't that rhyme so the heavens will shut up until that prophecy could come to pass until the word had to come from Elijah Prophet to unlock that same Heavens that he shot there by prophecy isn't that right so until the word of the Lord come to that same Prophet nothing could move it's not it was a dried up there was famine in the land now today there's a famine in the land oh Hallelujah but that's coming for the abundance of rain but it has to come by the prophecy oh oh Hallelujah gotta come by that Prophet oh honey it's got to come through a prophecy you've got to take a key and unlock the door and the key tonight is Page to unlock the promises of God because behind that door is the Dynamics that you are looking for the Revival that you are looking for is right behind that door but you've got to have feet tonight to turn here and unlock the promises of God to your life and that key come true a prophet Malachi foreign but it takes fate take a revelation to see it to see your promise for your day in your season and to speak it by Revelation and to sow the seeds oh Hallelujah isn't that right so all these years since the prophet left oh Hallelujah we've seen something in the world seven Thunders seven voices seven Church ages that teach us what seeds the soul because we couldn't have our seven tunder Revival until we saw seeds for it oh but we keep sowing seeds we keep prophesying prophesying again from the book take the book eat the book prophesy again it will sweetened them out it was wonderful to talk about but it was bitter in the belly we had to stand a reproach of baroness all these years where is it where is it I can't see it but it's a prophecy it's coming I see my children coming back I see [Music] but God Give Me Faith or Revelation a rock upon which I stand and God will build his church not upon the nominations but upon a rock or the revelation of Jesus Christ I'll build my church and the Gate of Hell cannot Prevail against it oh Hallelujah do you believe that and that's why we've been standing all these years we weren't standing upon the sand we would have washed away a long time ago we were washed away in the 70s washed away in the 80s wash away in the 90s and wherever praise God but a revelation in our hearts is what kept us standing all these years and now I am just as strong as I was when I first started out now therefore give me my mountain that I've been pressing for praying for crying for fighting for backlin for all these years now therefore give me my Mountain come on Pride you have another spirit with you oh it is a triumphant Spirit seven spirits come down from eternity to give you your promised word get a little shout out praise oh hallelujah it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming I hear the sound of the abundance of rain rain is getting ready to fall dig ditches tonight get everything ready get your heart right we are right in time God will too in one year what all theologians fail to do in 2000 years oh let your faith Reach Out believe it for this year that God will do what all the men in a message fail to do fail to do God will do it through a predestinated pride oh she will shake the world once more the world will hear direct from God oh give a lot of shout good I feel religious prophecy prophesy tonight oh honey you're gonna make it you're gonna overcome my prophesy over them dry bones in your life do like Ezekiel don't look at the bones look at the prophecy let the bone come to bone look at the prophecy don't look at what's going on down there though ten thousand follow my right side step over the ten thousand and say let these tripods live let these phone come to pawn let sinews come upon these bones let flesh come upon these sinews that skin cover over his flesh and let the Breath of God bring life into these bones that they might live God's pulling a church together tonight some from the north some from the south gathering together all of his beloved ones all of the backsliders they are coming back home they're coming back into the house of God God's Great Gathering of eagles caught getting ready to release omnipotence in order to do that he had to have you in the right place no wonder Joseph told the children of Israel when you leave Egypt take my bone to with you don't leave them behind because I believe Dynamics is coming Dynamics is coming Dynamics is coming and tonight Dynamics is coming to Quicken these dry bones to Quicken these troubles and make them live [Music] oh keep riding keep riding you like Paul Rita tonight I'm riding and I'm riding and riding anointing they were dry seeds it's not right but a purple Peter James John there were dry seeds they didn't feel to go to church but they hold themselves up into the upper room and they stayed there not until they felt a sensation but until they be a dude with power from on high that's what we are waiting on that's what we're looking for that would be an expectation for I don't care about no interpretation I don't care what no no man has to say I want to see the Lord God omnipotent come down with his fire and baptize All Souls and seal us into that portal cap by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's what I'm looking for tonight somebody say Amen somebody praise [Applause] oh man okay almost there amen just about five more minutes just almost there all right so this happened so shut up until the prophecy come to pass into the word of the Lord come to that prophet and on the third seal the brides the prophet said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet it's been no Revival there so shut up the whole thing is shut down try no manifestation of God to say the bride yet see that's the condition we see now but he said we're looking for it now because we know that it's out there somewhere God is not a liar his prophecy is true the time may be long but don't Atari wait for it Revelation give us Vision to wait for his vision his prophecy to come to pass we're connecting with the tonight we're connecting with it this evening hallelujah oh my [Music] God see the world was framed by the word of God which means the word itself is a framework through which the mind of Christ the intelligence could come through and interpret his thoughts so the word comes the interpretation of his thoughts that we could catch and understand and believe unto his prophecy because a word is a mental state a word one day it's gonna become seed it's going to come manifestation in your life do you believe that Isaiah 55 says as a word praise God torture my worthy but come down praise God it shall not return void but it shall accomplish a purpose that I set forth for it to accomplish isn't that right therefore it means a word is not supposed to remain word but the word have one mission to accomplish a purpose to accomplish a purpose therefore what is a purpose what is the purpose called sending a bride on the edge it was a try her it was approved to the devil that she is not like Eve that she could stand with that world anytime anywhere under any condition you are gonna prove these seven sealed seven tons of Virtues are Malachi 4 you're gonna be a walking living moving Monumental court on the earth and the devil can shake you he never gave it to you and he cannot take it away from you tonight we are predestinated to overcome and to claim our inheritance oh do you believe it tonight [Applause] oh my oh I'm trying to find a place of clothes oh Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] but I wanted to watch what happened in the time of Elijah getting ready to close now time Elijah now remember the people are falling away from the word there was a mixed multitude isn't that right it's not a Silverado Gods so Elijah call him a big Showdown that was Mount Carmel isn't that right what did he do there he repealed an altar he re-established the ordinances of God he brought the people back to the the Plumb line isn't that right brought him back to the world back to what was established in the beginning he rebuilt an altar just like uh Abraham and on altar just like job had an altar he rebuilt an altar praise God and town came to Fire and God proved himself God be God let the corner answer my fire let that God be God tonight and tonight what we want what we need in the church tonight is the god who can answer my fire by fire but befriend the fire I need the fire I want to get gone tonight burn out all the lusts burn out all the lies burn out all the filch and let the glory of God come inside of your sword and make you a real Chris China so that you'll stop playing church and that you'll come to the Altar and be broken for your sins and let the fire of God the same fire that come down from heaven let that come on and consume the sacrifice oh other than prove himself to be God Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah nobody also was very established he brought all those Fallen prophets down there all those false prophets and slew them down there and then he told Ahab said get me up rain is about to fall praise God we've got everything ready and that's what you got to do tonight take all those filthy all those false prophets all those priests all those things and bring them down to the river and cut them up burn them chop their heads off and re-establish the altar of prayer tonight in your home and in your life re-establish The Altar and cut down all those priests cut down all those Idols cut on all those idol worship him praise God kick him out tonight all the loss all the lies all the things that occupy your time cut off their heads dismember them tonight and let the king of glory come riding into your home riding into your life riding into your prayer closet when you do these things look out for the fire because all things are ready the prophecy is getting ready to come to pass the night [Applause] Hallelujah oh yes We Struck it could play something softly that's the part I want to get to

God bless you praise God Amen Hallelujah amen okay Jeremiah 29 11 for another thoughts that I think towards you said Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to bring you to a expected end there's an expected end concerning you tonight oh God knows what you're going to look like in that wedding supper and he's getting you ready to meet that audience isn't that right you believe that oh amen what are you just quick quote here I love this quote this is my favorite quote here Prophet said Abraham which represented the elected church was living poor living on the deserts and so forth but notice just before the destruction of Sodom there was an angel that come to him he said is that right he said and the angel was talking to Abraham had his back turned to the tent and Cyrus on the inside and the angel told Abraham I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and Sarah in her heart laughed inside the tent the angel with his button to the tent said why did Sarah laugh oh Hallelujah some of us might have laughed ourselves tonight isn't that right oh but he said why did Sarah laugh now he said watch now he said uh he said what kind of teleport is that Prophet said remember that angel had the last message not before the water fell but he had the last message the one that came to Iran had the last message before the fire fell who was that angel the prophet said he was Christ Abraham called him Elohim Jehovah Almighty the logos sure he was God the prophet said here it is and just before the destruction of fire again that same Angel is among his people today Revelation 10 calling you out to the church members come out come out from among them that's right get away from it quickly she's gonna sink just as certain oh Hallelujah so that angel come down praise God that angel we see here he come down just before what just before the fire was fixed into four to tell Abraham surely I can't hide from you what I'm about to do and for the election God sent down his Angel to testify of these things to the churches who is he I am the roots and The Offspring of David I am the bright and Morning Star he come down upon Malachi for prophets just before the fire fell to give you a message to shout a message out and when he cried seven Thunders are at their voices and that message went out throughout the Earth what was that message looking for it was looking for you it was looking for me that message oh that prophecy went out of thrown all yet when in Africa it went in Egypt Australia North America South America Canada Nigeria wherever and it found the seeds of God laying around the earth it came down in Trinidad and it found you brother Branham never came to Trinidad but his message for on the second coming of Christ God found a way to get that message to you to get that prophecy to you to get you ready for the fire that is fixing to fall in your life life somebody lift your hands tonight somebody praise him I'm finished tonight but who can but prophesy
