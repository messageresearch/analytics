[35:43] without wasting time i just want to read
[35:45] from the scriptures
[35:47] just in line with the inspiration of the
[35:49] meetings
[35:51] isaiah 21
[35:53] i want to read verse 11.
[35:55] the burden of dharma he call it to me
[35:59] out of seer
[36:02] watchman
[36:03] what of the night
[36:05] watchman
[36:07] what of the night
[36:08] the watchman said
[36:10] money
[36:12] and also the night
[36:14] if you will inquire inquire
[36:17] ye
[36:18] return
[36:20] come
[36:22] may god a blessing to the reign of his
[36:24] word in jesus christ's name
[36:27] amen i just
[36:29] want to follow the inspiration of the
[36:31] meeting
[36:32] as concerning
[36:34] matthew 25 from verse 1
[36:37] talking about
[36:39] um
[36:41] the parable of the
[36:44] ten vegans
[36:47] five
[36:49] we are wise
[36:51] and five were foolish
[36:54] and jesus was speaking in this parable
[36:57] pointing to today the end time
[37:01] concerning the preparation of the bride
[37:05] for the takeoff into the rapture
[37:09] and we know too well how the entire
[37:11] world had been today
[37:14] we know very well how the world has been
[37:16] falling apart
[37:18] and it's no more a surprise
[37:20] that all the scriptures are almost
[37:23] fulfilled
[37:25] and the question we have in our heart is
[37:28] are we prepared
[37:30] and bro abraham was speaking
[37:34] here in this message
[37:39] he said
[37:45] well they just say that
[37:48] something today there is no difference
[37:51] the devil always takes his man
[37:54] but never the spirit it lives on another
[37:57] man god takes his man but never the
[38:00] spirit
[38:01] it comes on down living on someone else
[38:05] so the same spirit still exists today
[38:09] we are not blind to these things and it
[38:11] would be good if we would listen to the
[38:14] voice of the one in the torah
[38:17] the holy spirit
[38:19] that is warning us
[38:22] fleeing
[38:23] the rot
[38:24] that is to come
[38:25] make ready because the hour is
[38:28] approaching
[38:30] amen
[38:31] and that's also the same situation
[38:34] the five wasn't fed the five wise virgin
[38:38] the five foolish virgins they got they
[38:41] they were together they had the way of
[38:43] agents
[38:45] and in that same way
[38:47] today
[38:49] we have people
[38:52] who have believed
[38:53] [Music]
[38:54] and having believed
[38:57] we are
[38:58] trying to scale our standard
[39:01] by what we reason by what we think by
[39:04] what we feel
[39:06] but this is the time we don't scale
[39:08] ourselves
[39:10] or measure with what we think what we
[39:12] believe what we what we want to get
[39:15] ourselves as a measure
[39:17] the measure we should have today should
[39:19] be the absolute revealed word of god
[39:22] thus said the lord or we keep still
[39:25] and the prophet said if you
[39:28] have to do the things i ask you to do i
[39:31] will meet you in the morning
[39:33] but we found out today that the message
[39:36] has been filled up with all kinds of
[39:38] ideas
[39:40] but there is always one idea by the holy
[39:42] spirit
[39:44] and i ask that god we help his people
[39:47] today the predestination of god that
[39:50] will we heed to that
[39:53] voice of god
[39:54] and if we have to start with our voice
[39:57] of god revealed word of the hour and
[39:59] live by it by the revelation of the holy
[40:02] spirit
[40:03] god is obligated
[40:05] to lead us to the end
[40:08] so i believe that god will still do what
[40:10] he says he would do
[40:13] amen
[40:14] god said in the bible take heed to the
[40:17] flock
[40:18] which the holy spirit has made you a
[40:21] watchman over
[40:23] be sure that they are fed with the right
[40:25] food
[40:26] making ready for the coming of the lord
[40:30] oh how it was sad
[40:32] when that great midnight crime
[40:34] came and it was all over
[40:37] it reminds me of a story that i read
[40:40] some years ago about a prosperous
[40:43] prospector in arizona he was one of
[40:46] those gold-minded people
[40:49] and he wanted to get rich all at once so
[40:52] he goes in to the desert to prospect
[40:56] while he was prospecting the story goes
[40:59] that he found a great nest of nuggets
[41:03] and just overnight became a
[41:06] multi-millionaire with the sacks full of
[41:09] gold and he packed his bureau
[41:12] and he and his bureau and friendful dogs
[41:15] started back to civilization with a
[41:18] sweat flying from his face his eyes a
[41:22] glittery and on his road to have a good
[41:25] time the rest of his life so when he was
[41:28] nearing to his place where he where his
[41:31] destination would was to be they said
[41:35] there was an old abandoned shack
[41:38] and he went into the district and laid
[41:41] the money out upon the table by a little
[41:44] green scandal and was looking over the
[41:47] nuggets
[41:48] little did he know that there was eyes
[41:52] watching him
[41:53] and along about
[41:55] the time that he laid down and went to
[41:58] sleep
[41:59] while he started to go to sleep the old
[42:02] faithful dog
[42:04] began to bank
[42:05] and he was lying on his below thinking
[42:08] oh tomorrow i will change this nuggets
[42:11] for currency
[42:12] and i will buy great cars and i will
[42:16] drink good whiskey i will do all these
[42:18] things and have a big time and i will go
[42:22] to every dance and all he would do
[42:25] they're drinking that
[42:27] and his dog kept barking backing away he
[42:31] went to the door and opened the door and
[42:33] said shut up
[42:35] and the dog went
[42:38] he was tied to a lush
[42:40] and he tried to warn his master but he
[42:44] went back again and laid down on his bed
[42:47] on his bed and again the dog started
[42:50] bathing again and he called him this
[42:53] he called him time after time shut up
[42:57] i don't want to hear you i want to love
[43:00] you i want lovely dreams tonight of the
[43:02] good times i am going to have tomorrow
[43:06] when i cash
[43:08] in my gold
[43:09] and finally
[43:11] the dog barked again
[43:13] he became he become angry he reached in
[43:16] the corner and got a double barrier
[43:19] shotgun and went to the door we bought
[43:22] the hammers back and shot the dog down
[43:25] to the dead
[43:26] said
[43:28] that we take care of you
[43:30] i wouldn't need you anymore anyhow
[43:33] set the gun down
[43:34] and lay down on the bed and fold in his
[43:37] hands with his dream and fell off to
[43:41] sleep
[43:41] just in a little while the door opened
[43:46] easily
[43:47] someone slipped across the door the
[43:49] floor and plunged
[43:50] a server knife into his bosom and took
[43:54] the gold and left with him
[43:56] left with it oh
[43:58] what did he do
[44:00] he killed the voice
[44:02] that was warning him
[44:04] let that not be our stand

[44:08] that voice of the holy spirit
[44:10] that warns the church

[51:22] book of
[51:24] 2nd peter chapter 3
[51:28] 2nd peter chapter 3
[51:32] verse 1 to 9.
[51:34] this second episode will be loved
[51:37] and i'll write unto you
[51:40] in both which i stir up your pure minds
[51:43] by way of remembrance
[51:46] that you may be mindful of the words
[51:48] which were spoken before
[51:51] by the holy prophets
[51:53] and of the commandments of all the
[51:55] apostles of the lord and savior
[51:58] knowing this quest
[52:00] that there shall come
[52:03] in the last days scoffers
[52:06] walking after their whole lost
[52:08] and saying where is the promise of his
[52:12] coming
[52:14] for since the fathers fell asleep
[52:16] all things continue as they were from
[52:19] the beginning of the creation
[52:22] for these they willingly are ignorant of
[52:26] that by the word of god
[52:28] the heavens were of hope
[52:31] and the heads standing out of the water
[52:34] and in the water
[52:36] whereby the walls that then was
[52:39] being overflowed with water perished
[52:42] for the heavens and the earth which are
[52:45] now by the same words are kept in store
[52:49] results onto fire against the day of
[52:52] judgment and petition of ungodly men
[52:57] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[53:00] thing
[53:01] that one day is with the lord as a
[53:04] thousand years
[53:05] and a thousand years as one day
[53:09] the lord is not slack concerning his
[53:11] promise
[53:12] as some men comes luckness what is not
[53:16] suffering towards what not willing that
[53:19] any shall perish for that all should
[53:22] come to repentance amen
[53:26] first thessalonians
[53:33] chapter 4
[53:38] first thessalonians chapter 4.
[53:51] i would like to read from the 13th verse
[53:55] but i will not have you to be ignorant
[53:57] progress
[53:58] concerning them which are asleep
[54:02] there is sorrow not
[54:04] even as others
[54:06] which have no hope
[54:08] for if we believe that jesus died and
[54:11] rules again
[54:12] he will serve them also which sleep in
[54:15] jesus
[54:16] will god bring with him
[54:19] for this will say unto you by the word
[54:21] of the lord
[54:22] that we which are alive and remain unto
[54:26] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[54:28] them which are asleep
[54:31] for the lord himself shall descend from
[54:33] heaven with a shout
[54:35] with the voice of the hack anger and
[54:38] with the trump of god
[54:40] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[54:44] then we which are alive and remain shall
[54:47] be caught up together with them
[54:49] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[54:52] earth and so shall we ever be with the
[54:55] lord
[54:56] wherefore
[54:57] comfort one another
[54:59] with his words
[55:00] my lord has pleasant to the reading of
[55:04] his own word makes you sense
[55:08] [Music]
[55:22] like to
[55:28] once again greet the saints in the name
[55:30] of the lord jesus christ
[55:33] the theme of the convention
[55:36] or the inspiration of the convention
[55:40] says behold
[55:42] the bridegroom comments
[55:46] and it's in love dreaming time
[55:49] amen
[55:50] now
[55:52] i want to speak on what the bridegroom
[55:56] is coming to do
[56:00] amen if the bright group is coming
[56:05] what does he have for us in his coming
[56:10] so
[56:11] in this convention
[56:13] i'll be speaking
[56:16] as much as i could
[56:19] i'll be speaking as much as i could
[56:23] on the rapture
[56:26] of the church of christ the rapture amen
[56:31] amen
[56:33] if the bridegroom is coming
[56:35] it's coming for one purpose
[56:38] and that is to take
[56:41] his bride
[56:43] out of the sin
[56:45] in the book of john chapter 14
[56:49] the lord jesus christ told us not to be
[56:52] troubled
[56:54] the lord jesus christ told us not to be
[56:57] scared
[56:59] the lord jesus christ told us not to be
[57:02] perplexed
[57:04] and he told us these things in a manner
[57:07] to give us a real assurance
[57:11] he said in my father's place there are
[57:14] many mentions
[57:16] amen
[57:18] and he said if these things were not so
[57:21] i would not have told you
[57:23] is that the reason i had to leave after
[57:26] the first time i came
[57:28] is for me to go and prepare a place for
[57:32] you
[57:33] amen
[57:34] i'm after the reparation of the place
[57:37] when he is ready he said i'm coming back
[57:41] to take you to myself
[57:44] now
[57:45] it might look like a general statement
[57:49] but i want you to know
[57:51] that christ has his own intentions
[57:54] of the kind of people he is coming to
[57:56] think to himself
[58:01] christ might have come for all
[58:04] in his first coming
[58:06] which the bible even told us
[58:09] that even though it seems presented for
[58:11] her
[58:12] yes
[58:13] the announcement of the angel
[58:16] said that he's coming for the salvation
[58:19] of his own people
[58:22] amen so if it was for the salvation of
[58:25] his own people
[58:27] if we look at that in the context of
[58:30] john chapter 3 16
[58:33] wherein he said for god so loved the
[58:35] world
[58:36] that he gave his only begotten son
[58:40] amen
[58:41] it was his love that made him give his
[58:43] only begotten son
[58:45] but come to think of it
[58:47] even though the begotten son was given
[58:50] for the entire world
[58:53] by that verse of the scripture
[58:57] it shows also that it is not the entire
[59:00] world that will embrace the gift of god
[59:04] he said but whosoever believes
[59:08] that whosoever
[59:10] are the people that christ had in his
[59:13] mind
[59:14] when he was coming in flesh
[59:17] in order to bring salvation to mankind
[59:22] and this is the reason it is important
[59:24] to note
[59:25] that if we have problems with the word
[59:28] predestination
[59:29] it will be a permanent problem in time
[59:34] the salvation that christ offers
[59:37] was offered for all
[59:40] was presented to all
[59:42] for by predestination it is not all that
[59:46] will accept that offering
[59:48] and you see let me take it further
[59:51] your acceptance of that offering
[59:54] has not gotten anything to do with your
[59:57] ability to choose and choose correctly
[1:00:02] your acceptance of that offering is also
[1:00:05] a work of election in itself
[1:00:11] your choice is not as independent as you
[1:00:14] thought
[1:00:16] if you think it was that independent
[1:00:19] then you will be slapping some
[1:00:21] scriptures
[1:00:22] the bible said god said i will have
[1:00:25] mercy on whom i will
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:29] we have compassion and we love
[1:00:31] compassion
[1:00:32] if he chooses not to have compassion on
[1:00:35] you you can never choose correctly
[1:00:38] so the choice you made was inspired
[1:00:45] by the election god has made of you
[1:00:50] as a matter of fact jesus our lord said
[1:00:53] you were not the one who chose me
[1:00:57] so really you have no choice in this
[1:00:59] business
[1:01:00] he said i chose you
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:04] so predestination
[1:01:07] is the maker of the clay
[1:01:11] or the product from the clay who will
[1:01:13] call potter choosing to make you a
[1:01:16] vessel of honor unto himself
[1:01:20] it's beyond your
[1:01:23] it's beyond your choices
[1:01:26] it's beyond your intention
[1:01:28] it is the mercy of god
[1:01:31] if you have accepted this message
[1:01:34] i congratulate you in the name of jesus
[1:01:36] christ
[1:01:38] it is only those who accepted that mercy
[1:01:41] in their age
[1:01:44] in the fullness
[1:01:47] that this is coming is actually meant
[1:01:50] for
[1:01:53] in john 4 37 i am going to prepare a
[1:01:56] place for you
[1:01:58] so that where i am there shall you be
[1:02:01] also
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:03] christ wants to have a living experience
[1:02:06] with you
[1:02:07] he wants to spend some good quality time
[1:02:10] with you
[1:02:11] he wants to have fellowship with you and
[1:02:14] that is the reason it will come back
[1:02:18] our lord will return to this act some
[1:02:20] sweet days
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:23] satan will be bound
[1:02:25] a thousand years
[1:02:26] we will have no temper then
[1:02:29] after jesus return
[1:02:31] to the earth i mean
[1:02:33] how many are living by the hope of his
[1:02:35] covenant
[1:02:37] how many believe you will come
[1:02:40] how many are expecting is coming
[1:02:43] how many are preparing for is coming
[1:02:47] behold the king comments
[1:02:50] he will suddenly come
[1:02:52] the unbelief of the world will be not in
[1:02:54] there is coming
[1:02:55] our lord will return to jesus
[1:02:58] he said we say to you by the word of the
[1:03:01] lord
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:06] but there are some things we must do
[1:03:09] there are some things we must understand
[1:03:12] about this is
[1:03:14] coming if it is coming
[1:03:18] we have established by the scriptures
[1:03:20] that is coming for his own
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:25] if you have no beginning with him
[1:03:27] you cannot end up in him
[1:03:30] hallelujah
[1:03:32] and christ does not hide that fact
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:36] christ has made odd choices
[1:03:40] that will make you realize that he can
[1:03:42] do without anybody
[1:03:45] and but nobody can do it
[1:03:47] without him
[1:03:49] when he went to the pool protester
[1:03:53] there were so many sick land and all
[1:03:55] kind of categories in there christ went
[1:03:58] there he chose to heal only one person
[1:04:02] and it departed
[1:04:05] does it look like he doesn't have
[1:04:07] compassion for the rest
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:10] but that was his problem for that time
[1:04:13] he is that one person and he left
[1:04:17] and nothing more
[1:04:18] do you realize that he did not reduce
[1:04:20] the fact that he is christ
[1:04:23] you realize that he did not change his
[1:04:25] position to us
[1:04:26] yesterday it was our lord
[1:04:29] today he is our lord tomorrow it will be
[1:04:32] our lord
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:35] even the three children said even if
[1:04:38] jesus is not to deliver us
[1:04:41] yet we will not deny him
[1:04:43] because the man that came into
[1:04:45] the fire
[1:04:46] kingdom who cannot testify he said the
[1:04:49] appearance
[1:04:51] looks like that of the son of god and
[1:04:54] that was with all abraham
[1:04:56] that he rejoiced to see his name came
[1:04:59] again in the body form and he opened the
[1:05:02] eyes of an even king to recognize who he
[1:05:04] was because indeed everybody
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:20] are you following
[1:05:22] so if christ come tomorrow
[1:05:25] and take only 10 people he will still
[1:05:28] remain crushed
[1:05:31] and speaking for those who believe that
[1:05:34] god will be too merciful to send anybody
[1:05:36] to the fires of hell
[1:05:39] hell is not being created for animals
[1:05:42] health was originally designed for satan
[1:05:45] and his angels
[1:05:47] but then they were cast down
[1:05:49] and they came with the lying spirit
[1:05:51] the spirit of the three of kin floods by
[1:05:54] which they have deceived the whole earth
[1:05:57] as many as follow their deception will
[1:05:59] not make it
[1:06:01] amen so the bride of christ will be
[1:06:04] those who has kept that deception
[1:06:06] you love him this morning
[1:06:08] all right i'm going
[1:06:10] gradually but i won't take the church
[1:06:13] for too long amen
[1:06:15] so what we are establishing is the fact
[1:06:18] that christ is coming
[1:06:21] and even it is coming he's not coming
[1:06:24] for sightseeing
[1:06:26] it's not coming to for sure mentioned
[1:06:28] he's not coming to show that he can come
[1:06:31] is actually coming
[1:06:33] in order to take his home
[1:06:36] there was a visible audience that he was
[1:06:38] addressing in that particular day
[1:06:42] do you realize that he was addressing
[1:06:44] his followers amen
[1:06:47] and in his prayer in john chapter 20 or
[1:06:50] chapter 7 he said never pray for this
[1:06:53] alone
[1:06:55] did you catch that for as many people as
[1:06:58] many as we believe me
[1:07:00] through the awareness
[1:07:02] amen so the path to those who will make
[1:07:06] it when it comes the path of those whom
[1:07:09] christ will take when they come is the
[1:07:11] part of those who are following
[1:07:14] christ through the words of those
[1:07:16] visible apostles
[1:07:18] so you cannot preach against the
[1:07:20] adoption and expect christ to come for
[1:07:23] you
[1:07:24] amen if
[1:07:25] if peter baptized in the name of jesus
[1:07:28] christ you cannot do contrary and expect
[1:07:32] christ to come for you
[1:07:34] if peter never obtains a woman preacher
[1:07:38] or paul never did a woman preacher as a
[1:07:40] matter of fact they spoke contrary to
[1:07:43] that amen you cannot
[1:07:45] you cannot do contrary to them and
[1:07:48] expect christ to come for you that part
[1:07:51] of those whom christ will fall comfort
[1:07:54] will follow the direction of the
[1:07:55] disciples you love him because they were
[1:07:58] the visible audience
[1:08:00] that he was speaking to on that day he
[1:08:02] said i'm coming for you and he said
[1:08:05] neither praying for these ones alone but
[1:08:07] for those who will believe me through
[1:08:09] the awareness so if you are believer in
[1:08:12] apostles and the prophet's doctrine you
[1:08:15] are a candidate
[1:08:17] for that god
[1:08:18] we shall get money together
[1:08:20] you love him this morning so christ will
[1:08:23] come and it's coming for the bride
[1:08:26] so be that is coming for the bride how
[1:08:29] does it takes its own that is coming for
[1:08:31] a way
[1:08:32] it takes them away
[1:08:34] by way of the what we have now come to
[1:08:36] know as rapture
[1:08:40] away
[1:08:42] rapture
[1:08:43] is not a word you will find in the bible
[1:08:47] what is the word that describes what
[1:08:49] christ will do
[1:08:51] when it comes
[1:08:53] in matthew chapter 25
[1:08:55] the bible says there were two categories
[1:08:58] of people who were expecting the coming
[1:09:01] of his bridegroom
[1:09:03] amen
[1:09:05] and one category was called the wise
[1:09:08] vegans
[1:09:09] the other category was called the
[1:09:12] foolish vegetables amen
[1:09:15] and they were described as being wise
[1:09:18] or foolish
[1:09:20] entirely only by their preparation
[1:09:25] because both of them were
[1:09:28] virgins
[1:09:29] i want you to underline that
[1:09:33] the only thing that qualifies one
[1:09:37] for to be a wise and qualifies the other
[1:09:41] has been foolish is just preparation
[1:09:45] preparation was what made a difference
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:51] between the foolish
[1:09:53] and the wise
[1:09:55] and i tell you today also preparation is
[1:09:58] the only thing
[1:10:01] that is gonna make a difference
[1:10:03] between the right
[1:10:06] of the people that christ will go with
[1:10:09] when it comes and those who will be left
[1:10:12] behind
[1:10:16] god has shown these two different types
[1:10:20] and shadows in the bible
[1:10:23] the rapture we are talking about is not
[1:10:26] going to be the first ever
[1:10:28] there have been several raptures in the
[1:10:31] bible
[1:10:33] follow me church
[1:10:36] in the time in the beginning
[1:10:39] in the time of
[1:10:41] in the era of enoch and noah
[1:10:44] there was a rapture
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:49] when elijah the teacher was here there
[1:10:51] was a rapture
[1:10:53] amen
[1:10:54] when our lord jesus christ was here
[1:10:57] there was a rapture
[1:11:04] and now there will be a rapture
[1:11:07] and he will not have a rapture there
[1:11:09] will be another one
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:12] according to revelations chapter 11
[1:11:15] there will be another option
[1:11:18] so rapture is a common exercise of god
[1:11:22] throughout history
[1:11:26] there is only one thing that can prepare
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:29] for the breadcrumb coming
[1:11:33] nobody ever is able
[1:11:36] to prepare
[1:11:38] it takes god to furnish preparation
[1:11:44] the mistake people will make
[1:11:48] is to be looking for how to prepare
[1:11:51] or inventing a preparation for
[1:11:54] themselves
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] they said it is love dreaming time the
[1:12:00] question is how do you trip your lives
[1:12:03] and what is the treatment of the lamb
[1:12:07] because you are alive we are not going
[1:12:09] to be giving a physical love
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] it looks like a love dreaming time
[1:12:14] because the world is going to get
[1:12:17] through at night time
[1:12:19] you know the foolish and the wise
[1:12:21] they've been waiting since morning
[1:12:24] did you catch them
[1:12:26] they've been waiting from morning
[1:12:28] and they waited till night
[1:12:32] and even the bridegroom never came at
[1:12:35] night
[1:12:36] did you catch that
[1:12:38] the bridegroom came after midnight
[1:12:42] oh yes so they waited a whole day
[1:12:46] it was the beginning of another day
[1:12:49] that witnessed the coming of the
[1:12:51] bridegroom
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:55] amen so for there to be a coming that
[1:12:57] will take you away another day must be
[1:13:00] declared
[1:13:09] till night
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:12] the bible said that wait was so long
[1:13:15] until the are in some laps
[1:13:19] why do they carry the land
[1:13:21] there never nobody needs their love
[1:13:24] during the day
[1:13:26] did you catch them
[1:13:28] their love is for help
[1:13:30] at
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:44] but the energy that powers the love is
[1:13:47] the holy spirit
[1:13:51] let us make it so simple
[1:13:53] so that we can grasp it
[1:13:56] and do not have a denominational
[1:13:58] understanding
[1:14:00] of all these blessings
[1:14:01] amen because the prophet said rapture is
[1:14:05] a revelation
[1:14:08] the revelation of which has been
[1:14:10] simplified for the bride of christ
[1:14:14] the foolish virgins
[1:14:15] and the wise veterans that what had the
[1:14:18] love
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:20] and they bought and why for a long time
[1:14:23] in their lives
[1:14:26] but the waiting was so long
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] and that is why apostle peter is here
[1:14:33] telling you and her
[1:14:35] do not surrender to the
[1:14:38] message to the revival of this coffers
[1:14:43] because their weight will be too
[1:14:45] unlocked for discovers to have revival
[1:14:50] they have to take advantage of the times
[1:14:54] in order to swear the fate of many
[1:14:56] people away
[1:14:59] opposed to peter said they will question
[1:15:02] the time
[1:15:03] the season and even the veracity of the
[1:15:07] message of his coming
[1:15:10] is that what the scripture said we read
[1:15:12] it together he said where is the promise
[1:15:15] of his coming
[1:15:16] some generations are raised to query
[1:15:19] that
[1:15:21] and that was why if you watch when the
[1:15:24] prophet was preaching the message
[1:15:26] rapture he devoted several pages
[1:15:30] before he even went into the contents of
[1:15:33] the rapture he devoted several pages to
[1:15:36] deal with the activities of discovers
[1:15:41] but here is a lesson i found to
[1:15:44] summarize it for you
[1:15:46] scoffers are those who try to um preach
[1:15:49] the truth
[1:15:53] yes if god give me a better summary we
[1:15:56] give the church
[1:15:58] sculptures are those that not only
[1:16:01] attack the truth
[1:16:02] they try to um preach it
[1:16:04] amen that is why if you reach the
[1:16:07] message rapture
[1:16:09] the prophet says coffers have risen now
[1:16:12] and what were they saying
[1:16:14] they were telling the people that some
[1:16:17] of the truths that we had in the
[1:16:19] scriptures
[1:16:20] are not supposedly like that again
[1:16:25] they attack the virgin birth
[1:16:27] listen church
[1:16:29] they attack the crossing of the red sea
[1:16:32] amen and in these last days they are
[1:16:35] packing something else
[1:16:37] similar in that life
[1:16:40] there are many things that are coming
[1:16:42] under attack but there are some three
[1:16:44] things that you must not discontinue
[1:16:47] because if dustin do not exist there is
[1:16:50] actually no exodus
[1:16:52] if those things did not exist there is
[1:16:54] actually no redemption
[1:17:00] i believe the church knows
[1:17:03] that we are in the exodus
[1:17:06] the prophet preached the message told
[1:17:08] exodus
[1:17:09] even though he called in the church he
[1:17:12] took time to show us the first and the
[1:17:14] second
[1:17:15] the first was when god was calling a
[1:17:19] nation out of a nation
[1:17:21] amen
[1:17:22] bringing out his own people out of the
[1:17:24] church watch that was the first exodus
[1:17:28] that was when he was calling israel out
[1:17:30] of egypt amen
[1:17:32] the second was when he was calling the
[1:17:35] church out of religion
[1:17:38] and the time was when he was calling
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] bride not even when he was
[1:17:45] when he eats
[1:17:47] because this is the commenter
[1:17:50] he's calling the bride out of the church
[1:17:54] now each of this exodus
[1:17:58] as a major lack
[1:17:59] of redemption
[1:18:02] that's right
[1:18:03] and what this compass intends to do
[1:18:06] is to attack the major mark
[1:18:10] of
[1:18:10] redemption to disprove that exodus and
[1:18:14] god's redemption
[1:18:16] now look at it if you take the red sea
[1:18:19] crossing
[1:18:21] of the children of israel out of the
[1:18:23] first exodus does that exodus make sense
[1:18:29] the prophet said the red sea crossing
[1:18:32] was to give them redemption blessing by
[1:18:35] power
[1:18:36] they cut it by blood through the lamb of
[1:18:39] the passover
[1:18:40] amen because redemption has got two
[1:18:42] parts
[1:18:43] hallelujah
[1:18:45] if you can send your soul it can heal
[1:18:47] your body
[1:18:48] you must enjoy retention by love then
[1:18:51] you enjoy it by power that is why for
[1:18:55] the church that is redeemed
[1:18:57] miracle signs and wonders will follow
[1:19:00] them
[1:19:01] he said this and shall follow those that
[1:19:03] believe
[1:19:04] in my name
[1:19:07] hallelujah
[1:19:09] i hope we are still shouting
[1:19:11] because we shall
[1:19:13] we don't look for signs and wonders they
[1:19:15] follow us
[1:19:17] that is the difference they won't look
[1:19:19] for it
[1:19:20] the sense of wonders look for them right
[1:19:23] if those things are not happening in
[1:19:25] your life the prophet said your life is
[1:19:27] not associated with victory
[1:19:31] it is not happening in our homes it is
[1:19:33] not happening in our church we are
[1:19:35] becoming powerless
[1:19:38] they must be there
[1:19:40] it is the word of the lord
[1:19:42] this is the article of our redemption
[1:19:45] and we hold them very there
[1:19:49] so our redemption must come by blood
[1:19:52] it must go by power
[1:19:54] if we have the wedge we will have the
[1:19:57] life
[1:19:58] because the word releases the spirit
[1:20:02] and the spirit
[1:20:03] manifestation
[1:20:05] wherever the spirit of god is there must
[1:20:08] be liberty
[1:20:09] there must be deliverance there must be
[1:20:12] practice
[1:20:13] there must be a holy
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:23] there must be truth
[1:20:25] and he shall know the truth
[1:20:27] and the truth will set us free
[1:20:30] then we must be free we must be at
[1:20:33] liberty to enjoy the blessings
[1:20:36] that god has really given unto us
[1:20:38] all glory to god
[1:20:41] above the smallest
[1:20:46] take that
[1:20:48] number two
[1:20:49] in the second exodus
[1:20:51] if you take the virgin bench
[1:20:55] out of the second exodus that exodus
[1:20:58] does not make sense
[1:21:01] because you are proving that jesus
[1:21:04] wasn't better than us
[1:21:06] and his blood was shed for nothing
[1:21:09] don't forget without the shedding of
[1:21:12] blood there is no remission of sins
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:16] so the redemption of the second exodus
[1:21:19] can only be punctuated by the shedding
[1:21:22] of the blood
[1:21:26] what do you know there's coffers
[1:21:29] attached these two things
[1:21:31] they said moses never actually opened no
[1:21:34] red sea
[1:21:36] they were trying to um preach the truth
[1:21:39] they sent israel and only passed through
[1:21:41] a bunch of reach
[1:21:45] and you know when they began to preach
[1:21:47] that some people believe in them
[1:21:51] because they are brought to believe
[1:21:55] blessed are those who are not offended
[1:21:57] in me
[1:21:58] but i tell you there will be a
[1:21:59] generation
[1:22:01] to offend
[1:22:02] and you cannot help them
[1:22:05] i'm building a case because i'm coming
[1:22:07] to this day
[1:22:09] until i reach here what i'm saying
[1:22:11] is not complete
[1:22:13] and i will reach here
[1:22:15] because i was attacked
[1:22:18] and they are influenced in the life of
[1:22:20] the believer opposed to peter
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:36] amen the birth of jesus was in virgin
[1:22:41] bed
[1:22:42] the prophet said the first time that was
[1:22:44] preached
[1:22:45] 500 ministers
[1:22:47] denounced the abduction of the fetching
[1:22:49] bear hey i started preaching contrary
[1:22:53] there will always be believers or such
[1:22:57] are you catholic
[1:22:59] no matter how wrong a subject is it will
[1:23:02] have its followers
[1:23:03] this is why even have is being enlarged
[1:23:07] because the followers are getting much
[1:23:09] more than expected
[1:23:11] because the whole man
[1:23:13] because there was just nothing in them
[1:23:15] to believe the truth
[1:23:17] and from 500
[1:23:18] imaginative 500 ministers overrun a
[1:23:22] place
[1:23:23] let even say
[1:23:25] by pyramid scheme they are getting one
[1:23:27] world coverage i tell believers in that
[1:23:30] today will be millions
[1:23:34] the prophet said is in 1965
[1:23:37] 1965 tonight's over 50 years
[1:23:41] so there's a generation believing today
[1:23:44] that jesus was not vegetable
[1:23:47] and what were they doing they were
[1:23:48] attacking the redemption punctuation
[1:23:51] the redemption mark of the second exodus
[1:23:55] in these last days
[1:23:58] the scoffers are back
[1:24:01] and i will warn you of them
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:06] now
[1:24:07] what church
[1:24:09] the prophet of the lord told us as we
[1:24:11] are going to see
[1:24:13] don't forget the prophet rapture is a
[1:24:16] revelation and i'm trying to open in
[1:24:18] simplicity the revelation of rapture
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:22] the prophet of the lord told us
[1:24:25] that for christ to bring rapture
[1:24:28] he brought a three-stage ministry
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] i'm not going into first testament here
[1:24:38] i'm going into the first
[1:24:41] stage of first
[1:24:42] thessalonians follow me
[1:24:44] because first thessalonians chapter 4
[1:24:47] have been confused and language
[1:24:52] but you will hear the truth
[1:24:54] that you can find in the pages of the
[1:24:56] world in simplicity now
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] the word of god is without confusion
[1:25:06] i know someone will be getting
[1:25:07] uncomfortable in their seats for the
[1:25:10] world of god doesn't make new man
[1:25:11] uncomfortable
[1:25:13] listen to the word and be delivered
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:19] but let's prepare the ground for him
[1:25:21] like this
[1:25:23] the lord jesus came with the three-stage
[1:25:26] ministry
[1:25:28] in his physical coming
[1:25:30] amen amen
[1:25:32] because
[1:25:34] he did not just get the people he
[1:25:36] addressed as wrap-up candidate in john
[1:25:39] 14 like that
[1:25:42] they went through a series of quality
[1:25:45] assurance process
[1:25:48] the communication it was addressing was
[1:25:50] so few
[1:25:52] but the revival of jesus gathered
[1:25:55] thousands
[1:25:58] how come it became few that received the
[1:26:01] message of rapture
[1:26:04] think about that for a minute
[1:26:07] we are seeing a convention that jesus
[1:26:10] addressed five thousand brethren
[1:26:12] we have seen in the program that jesus
[1:26:15] addressed four thousand brethren
[1:26:18] but when it came to the message of the
[1:26:20] rapture he was addressing very few
[1:26:22] people
[1:26:26] because he has already told us stretch
[1:26:28] is the gate
[1:26:30] narrow is the way
[1:26:32] i'm feeling happy that we find it
[1:26:38] because for the true church that we make
[1:26:41] rapture rapture is a revelation
[1:26:46] watch this
[1:26:49] the prophet called his three stages of
[1:26:51] ministry
[1:26:52] three pools
[1:26:54] he was using the word pools
[1:26:57] because of the vision god gave him
[1:27:00] because god gave him a vision that
[1:27:03] sacrifices ministry as a fish catching
[1:27:06] experience
[1:27:08] are you cutting it
[1:27:10] in cutting fish
[1:27:13] or you pull the hook
[1:27:15] with the layer on top of it amen
[1:27:19] the prophet said when you do a festival
[1:27:23] you do it to make the fish relax
[1:27:26] your pool flows with the ocean current
[1:27:30] so that the fish cannot detect that
[1:27:32] there is a pulling
[1:27:34] so you've got to be an expert
[1:27:36] in order to pull the hook
[1:27:38] that has the bait amen
[1:27:41] without the fish knowing
[1:27:43] that you were pulling the fish would
[1:27:45] think it is the current of the water
[1:27:48] that is pulling the hook
[1:27:50] so if god will be smart sensitive
[1:27:54] this is why this ministry of the
[1:27:56] messenger cannot be carried by everybody
[1:28:00] and that is why every imaginations that
[1:28:03] we have gotten around it are collapsing
[1:28:07] you can never be using the word of the
[1:28:10] prophet
[1:28:11] and let me tell you there is no finished
[1:28:13] business
[1:28:14] in terms of bringing the revelation of
[1:28:16] the world yes by the prophet law of
[1:28:19] finnish business
[1:28:21] he said all the mysteries have been
[1:28:23] revealed
[1:28:24] and the seals are open
[1:28:26] for
[1:28:32] it is the thought of a finnish business
[1:28:35] that has attracted the generation of old
[1:28:37] fighters
[1:28:38] who only succeeded in taking the
[1:28:41] believers back to the denomination the
[1:28:44] message called them all off
[1:28:46] but thanks be to god
[1:28:49] the jubilee time has arrived
[1:28:51] incarcerations of this meeting
[1:28:54] all fighters are giving way
[1:28:57] because the children of jubilee must be
[1:28:59] delivered
[1:29:00] it was the blood of jesus that portrays
[1:29:02] you
[1:29:03] it is the blood of jesus that will be
[1:29:05] serve you
[1:29:06] it is the blood of jesus i will give you
[1:29:08] the rapture
[1:29:14] you love me
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:18] so
[1:29:19] when he thinks the first time because he
[1:29:21] made it so disarming the fish follows
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:26] then the fish is gathering confidence
[1:29:28] that this is not a trap and is following
[1:29:31] and they will put his mouth and start
[1:29:34] tapping on the beach
[1:29:36] and the fishermen we give another pool
[1:29:40] amen and that another pool was a big
[1:29:43] farmer but it looks as if the ocean
[1:29:46] current was beaten either
[1:29:48] to the fish
[1:29:49] and then because of much more confidence
[1:29:52] the fish is now ready to swallow
[1:29:56] oh man
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] for swallow debate you know when he
[1:30:01] swallows the pigs
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:19] hook
[1:30:19] because the bait is hiding the hook
[1:30:23] are you catching it so when the
[1:30:25] fisherman
[1:30:27] sees that the fish has gained confidence
[1:30:30] and is already swallowing the whole
[1:30:33] thing what will they do if we go for the
[1:30:36] third one
[1:30:37] and the third one is what
[1:30:39] is that the third one is the total that
[1:30:42] gives a serious job
[1:30:45] when it's just that they hook this time
[1:30:48] around it uncovers
[1:30:51] and it holds
[1:30:53] a portion of the fish
[1:30:55] and the fish have no option
[1:30:58] like you have no option
[1:31:00] amen if you still think you have an
[1:31:04] option you are not yet a believer
[1:31:07] if you are still looking for an
[1:31:08] alternative for this glorious message
[1:31:11] you are not yet converted
[1:31:14] that fish that is being touched
[1:31:17] by the top pulley
[1:31:19] which is a serious jack have no options
[1:31:22] even when he protests he have no option
[1:31:26] he must come with the hook he must
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:43] then you will surrender
[1:31:45] and use that sage
[1:31:47] be listened to me
[1:31:49] according to your words
[1:31:51] hallelujah
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:56] it is against your position
[1:31:58] it is against your child
[1:32:00] it is a work of election
[1:32:02] and you all can relate with him
[1:32:05] that there was a time you don't mind the
[1:32:07] message
[1:32:08] there was a time you were looking like
[1:32:10] this like that for one day
[1:32:13] you couldn't sleep
[1:32:15] one day
[1:32:16] you began wrestling
[1:32:18] do you know what the prophet said it is
[1:32:20] the situation
[1:32:22] that is connected
[1:32:23] with what is hearing
[1:32:25] i'm telling your chemistry
[1:32:27] this is your life
[1:32:29] this is the truth you will never know
[1:32:32] you will never know john until you
[1:32:34] surrender
[1:32:36] and today you are
[1:32:38] here are no longer struggling to
[1:32:41] surrender
[1:32:43] it has become easy
[1:32:44] because you've got the hook happy who
[1:32:47] got you
[1:32:49] if you are biting me
[1:32:51] and my mother fighting you
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:07] amen reasoning days are over
[1:33:09] it is time to surrender
[1:33:12] it is time to let go
[1:33:14] and laying the presence of the
[1:33:16] restaurant
[1:33:17] to back out
[1:33:19] the big green out of your life and
[1:33:22] prepare yourselves
[1:33:25] for the master's eyes
[1:33:30] it looks like i've gone ahead of myself
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] that is god's problem
[1:33:43] so that is what is called the three pose
[1:33:46] so the first full spiritually speaking
[1:33:49] amen
[1:33:50] was what the sign in the hand
[1:33:54] hallelujah
[1:33:56] hallelujah
[1:33:57] the second bull
[1:33:59] was the worst
[1:34:01] was the ability to tell the secrets of
[1:34:03] the heart
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:06] you know even though those two things
[1:34:08] were outstanding
[1:34:10] yes they were not salvation
[1:34:13] come and judge yes come and join
[1:34:17] the only way you will know
[1:34:19] is that what is the effect
[1:34:22] is it permanent
[1:34:24] did he change your permanent
[1:34:25] you could get ill of one sickness today
[1:34:28] and you can have another tomorrow
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:38] you could feel for standing today
[1:34:40] hearing your secrets being told you
[1:34:43] and tomorrow you lose confidence
[1:34:46] as some are doing and their faith is
[1:34:48] being overthrown
[1:34:50] you will respect those who are attacking
[1:34:52] the message today to at least respected
[1:34:54] the fact that even their mummies and
[1:34:57] daddies
[1:34:58] are outstanding experiences
[1:35:00] and testimonies that they themselves are
[1:35:03] preached about
[1:35:07] they only preach those things it never
[1:35:09] makes me faint
[1:35:11] in your heart
[1:35:13] coming church
[1:35:14] you will expect that at least
[1:35:17] this man was vindicated
[1:35:20] the prophet of the lord said listen to
[1:35:22] me church
[1:35:23] the prophet of the lord said
[1:35:26] when jesus began to sound his thought
[1:35:29] pool
[1:35:30] after the healing and discernment
[1:35:33] when he began to break his message
[1:35:36] which message i'm coming to it
[1:35:39] is actually the first stage
[1:35:42] of the coming of the lord amen
[1:35:49] i will knock some things out of here too
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] which message is actually the first
[1:35:55] stage of the calling of the lord the
[1:35:58] third face of the ministry what's
[1:36:00] actually the first phrase
[1:36:02] of christ's comments
[1:36:05] are spoken in first thessalonians
[1:36:07] chapter four
[1:36:16] the prophet said when jesus our lord was
[1:36:18] here he has a three-stage ministry also
[1:36:21] the reason the messenger of this last
[1:36:23] age must have a three-stage ministry was
[1:36:26] because he actually had no ministry
[1:36:30] amendment
[1:36:39] the ministry he had is to reveal the son
[1:36:42] of man
[1:36:43] so if he is to reveal the son of man he
[1:36:46] must bring to you the reincarnated
[1:36:49] ministry
[1:36:50] of jesus christ
[1:36:52] will islam will not be the person of
[1:36:54] christ
[1:36:56] for the ministry it brings will be the
[1:36:58] ministry
[1:36:59] the exact ministry of the lord jesus
[1:37:02] christ
[1:37:04] nothing more
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:11] so the characteristic of that ministry
[1:37:14] must be the same
[1:37:15] why will he bring it
[1:37:17] he has to bring it because when christ
[1:37:20] our lord himself brought it he brought
[1:37:22] it to only two classes
[1:37:24] or races of mankind whereas we have
[1:37:27] three
[1:37:29] he brought it to the jews and to these
[1:37:32] americans
[1:37:33] he never gave the gentiles
[1:37:35] radical gentiles
[1:37:37] by god's providence taught some
[1:37:39] blessings
[1:37:40] god's magical truth
[1:37:43] by god's dominance today is getting our
[1:37:46] blessings
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:28] brother
[1:38:30] we'll reveal this son of god
[1:38:33] the lord jesus christ
[1:38:36] for him to bring a perfect revelation
[1:38:39] christ must have known to him his
[1:38:41] ministry
[1:38:43] this is why we believe in the incarnate
[1:38:47] ministry
[1:38:48] of the lord jesus christ
[1:38:51] so what he teach them must be repeated
[1:38:53] again
[1:38:55] because it is the cycle of life the
[1:38:58] genitals must have their full content
[1:39:00] like those guys are there
[1:39:02] this is our season
[1:39:04] this is our day and we are enjoying it
[1:39:07] and we are not going to allow any evil
[1:39:09] fly
[1:39:21] because we must destroy the influence
[1:39:24] of this conference in your life
[1:39:27] because the activity according to the
[1:39:29] scripture
[1:39:31] is to destroy your faith for the rapture
[1:39:34] for christ will come
[1:39:45] the prophet said
[1:39:47] when he began to sound his message which
[1:39:49] was his purpose
[1:39:51] the reason for which he came which is
[1:39:53] the message to prepare the bride
[1:39:56] out of the groud for the rapture
[1:40:00] a lot of people took offense
[1:40:03] where were the five thousand
[1:40:06] where were the four thousand where were
[1:40:08] they 70 it's in your bible where were
[1:40:11] those who were so excited about his
[1:40:14] ministry i never concluded we must
[1:40:17] install him as our king
[1:40:18] the official house the bible said they
[1:40:21] took offence
[1:40:25] but there was this generation of fear
[1:40:29] for which you belong
[1:40:32] listen this is the blessing i'm bringing
[1:40:34] you know what the prophet said
[1:40:36] he said these people
[1:40:38] did not even understand
[1:40:44] what christ had said
[1:40:46] but christ has been vindicated love
[1:40:51] for them to know
[1:40:53] you can never tell them wrong
[1:40:58] this was one god bless you
[1:41:00] this was my peter said
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:24] and whatever it means
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:42:03] [Applause]
[1:42:21] [Applause]
[1:42:27] the revelation of it so any little upset
[1:42:30] they take offense what is your joy to
[1:42:33] appreciate you for 45 years and you are
[1:42:36] attacking it today brother you were
[1:42:38] blind before
[1:42:40] you were planned
[1:42:51] let me tell you
[1:42:52] there have been many things
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:59] [Applause]
[1:43:04] i said many things
[1:43:06] you will never be able to understand
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:12] intentionally
[1:43:14] amen just to watch what you are going to
[1:43:16] do with that
[1:43:18] but you know why we are going there
[1:43:20] do you know why we will not worry you
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:33] indicated
[1:43:35] i can show you in the scripture with my
[1:43:38] natural heart
[1:43:40] things that look like discrepancies
[1:43:42] and you stop it for me
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:45] they look like underlying
[1:43:48] it is the poverty of our understanding
[1:43:51] they are making sense so
[1:43:52] for reading verbally
[1:43:54] reading
[1:43:56] reading naturally they look like
[1:43:59] even in their accounts there are the
[1:44:01] four hospitals
[1:44:03] the fourth hospital matthew mark
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:32] what happened what happened through your
[1:44:35] bible
[1:44:36] inside fire
[1:44:38] because the bible
[1:44:40] the love of the bible
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:52] it is possible for the interpretation of
[1:44:54] the bible to also look like that
[1:45:03] it is very important
[1:45:05] for the interpretation
[1:45:06] because this interpretation can only
[1:45:09] interpret what has been written if the
[1:45:12] writing is like this the interpretation
[1:45:14] will
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:22] it is for those who are brought to
[1:45:24] salvation to pick their salvation
[1:45:32] [Applause]
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:42] i'm going somewhere
[1:45:44] so in these last days
[1:45:46] just as they took offense
[1:45:48] and they began to speak full events
[1:45:51] about the article of redemption they've
[1:45:54] come back discovered
[1:45:56] to attack the article of redemption in
[1:46:00] the dead exodus
[1:46:02] if the first game under the attack
[1:46:04] secondary attack the time will come
[1:46:06] under the attack
[1:46:08] do you know brethren
[1:46:10] you cannot talk about redemption
[1:46:12] the exodus the calling out of the
[1:46:14] gentile bride without referring to the
[1:46:17] mystery cloud
[1:46:20] that's right that's for those who want
[1:46:22] revelation
[1:46:24] that's
[1:46:42] [Applause]
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:52] spiritual
[1:46:54] it is men that carry them
[1:46:57] and once more they jump on another
[1:47:00] you kill the thief in the same place you
[1:47:02] are shooting the thief stealing is going
[1:47:04] on
[1:47:05] come on you cannot actually kill a deed
[1:47:08] you are only killing the victim of the
[1:47:10] thief
[1:47:11] because everybody being controlled by
[1:47:13] demons
[1:47:16] they don't need our judgment they need
[1:47:17] our pity
[1:47:19] they need our transmission
[1:47:21] that the lord will deliver them
[1:47:23] whatever is holding you captive
[1:47:25] makes you a victim
[1:47:27] hallelujah
[1:47:29] i can assure you you will get my prayer
[1:47:32] you will get my intercession if you are
[1:47:34] honest and you have issues come up and
[1:47:36] tell it
[1:47:37] i will mock you
[1:47:39] because the bible said confess your
[1:47:41] fault
[1:47:42] to one another and pray
[1:47:45] for one another
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:48:02] one
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:17] with the festival
[1:48:21] signing the hat
[1:48:23] he came with the second
[1:48:24] ability to know the secrets of the house
[1:48:27] but you know what they called it
[1:48:29] because the true
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:45] coming to 1964 he calls the two the
[1:48:48] signs
[1:48:51] and if there's a sign
[1:48:53] there must be a voice
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:56] the sign is announcing
[1:48:59] you getting it
[1:49:01] so those things as powerful
[1:49:04] and as long as they were
[1:49:06] that we enjoyed them they were not
[1:49:08] salvation
[1:49:10] they were only the attractions
[1:49:14] for us to get the real thing
[1:49:19] so if you are attracted by signs and
[1:49:21] wonders
[1:49:22] there is no proof that you will wrap
[1:49:24] your candidates
[1:49:28] some people were attracted by loaves and
[1:49:30] breads
[1:49:31] and before jesus left they showed their
[1:49:33] calls
[1:49:35] even though they have enjoyed his
[1:49:36] blessings are you catching them
[1:49:39] but before he left they showed their
[1:49:40] color
[1:49:41] every blessings they enjoyed never mix
[1:49:44] with faith in their heart
[1:49:45] there was a generation who saw the
[1:49:48] supernatural power of god in the
[1:49:49] wilderness and the bible said they were
[1:49:52] everyone dead
[1:49:54] because what they saw never makes you
[1:49:56] faint
[1:49:57] judge i'm bringing it over to you now
[1:50:00] look at this church
[1:50:02] now
[1:50:04] after those signs and wonders were good
[1:50:07] the prophet kept talking about his
[1:50:09] message amen
[1:50:13] yeah
[1:50:14] the sun in the heart takes care of your
[1:50:16] body
[1:50:19] the messianic disarmament
[1:50:22] takes care of your spirits
[1:50:25] but something must take care of your
[1:50:27] soul
[1:50:30] this is why many people who enjoyed
[1:50:33] those great outstanding miracles and not
[1:50:36] believers today
[1:50:39] thousands in bombay india thousands in
[1:50:41] south africa thousands all over the
[1:50:43] world we are in
[1:50:45] the bride should be up to a billion
[1:50:47] right now
[1:50:50] but you aren't going to have such
[1:50:51] figures
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:57] why was the message of rapture only to
[1:51:00] few
[1:51:01] listen to my church
[1:51:03] when people are attracted
[1:51:06] they are attracted to get a message
[1:51:12] it is that message that actually touches
[1:51:15] your soul
[1:51:16] i begin the formation of christ
[1:51:20] amen
[1:51:22] because you must be of the same material
[1:51:25] with the one who is coming for you
[1:51:28] if i'm holding a magnet
[1:51:31] a real potent magnet the magnet if i
[1:51:35] wear it like this
[1:51:36] it will only attract
[1:51:39] products of similar material
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:46] even affect people
[1:51:49] for if your material is metal
[1:51:51] not in your aluminium
[1:51:56] you have the chances of being attracted
[1:51:58] and as you are turning the magnet around
[1:52:01] those materials will be turning around
[1:52:04] if you guard them for a little sweet
[1:52:07] you will see them catching up catching
[1:52:10] up that's exactly our option
[1:52:14] you've got to build the same material
[1:52:17] with him
[1:52:18] in order to be caught up with him
[1:52:23] are you catching that one
[1:52:24] because there will be a sweep
[1:52:27] his feet is not going to touch here
[1:52:30] but they are being sweet enough
[1:52:33] to give you such a connection
[1:52:37] oh man
[1:52:40] this is why you need something
[1:52:44] that can prepare you
[1:52:46] in the material shape
[1:52:49] of the great magnet
[1:52:52] i'm saying the sun in the hands can't be
[1:52:55] behaved
[1:53:11] the mysteries of god unveiled
[1:53:14] from cover to cover
[1:53:16] amen
[1:53:21] if it gets the heart of that bride
[1:53:25] is that what
[1:53:26] it starts the process of nourishing the
[1:53:28] city
[1:53:31] which was your and is your real you
[1:53:35] amen
[1:53:36] the prophet said the nature of your face
[1:53:40] was the nature imposed by sexpert
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:44] that is why it has got to die
[1:53:47] so that your real you
[1:53:50] reach the best invisible union
[1:53:52] the one you really are
[1:53:55] because that is your true justification
[1:53:58] it was an impossible nature of that
[1:53:59] misbehave
[1:54:01] he that is one of god
[1:54:03] does not and cannot commit sin
[1:54:07] because it doesn't happen to him as a
[1:54:09] desire
[1:54:10] it doesn't happen in him as an appetite
[1:54:13] everyone that can commit sin was laying
[1:54:16] dormant
[1:54:17] until the light of the hour
[1:54:22] i'm bringing it to the light again
[1:54:24] until the light of the hour
[1:54:27] that can never come down
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:31] because the oil is not sustained by you
[1:54:35] did you hear hearts not the oil and the
[1:54:37] wine
[1:54:38] amen do you hear god commanding and
[1:54:41] charging
[1:54:43] the forces of darkness that this one
[1:54:46] cannot be hot
[1:54:47] if it's hot in your life you are not in
[1:54:49] the program
[1:54:51] this one is so dense
[1:54:54] but the one who is preparing you inside
[1:54:57] all you are doing is that you are
[1:54:59] yielding
[1:55:00] and surrendering to the problem
[1:55:03] and grace is taking over
[1:55:05] every day
[1:55:07] walking upon the atoms of your body
[1:55:10] and changing you
[1:55:12] from georgia glory
[1:55:14] you cannot prepare by yourself
[1:55:17] you need the message of preparation
[1:55:19] and what do you do with the message of
[1:55:21] preparation ascension
[1:55:24] take it into you
[1:55:26] as it comes into you
[1:55:28] it gives quick notice
[1:55:30] to everything undesirable all the false
[1:55:33] glows all the fools glow
[1:55:35] we've been beating out
[1:55:37] what to be left of you
[1:55:39] is a pure one
[1:55:41] that will magnetize with the great
[1:55:43] magnet
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:58] the top pull is not signed in the hand
[1:56:00] the top one is not the same examination
[1:56:03] the top pull is the opening of the word
[1:56:06] something that reaches down to your soul
[1:56:09] and that is
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:24] if anybody tells you that is confused
[1:56:27] the shout is not illegal
[1:56:30] the shout is not
[1:56:32] oh church church
[1:56:35] is the shout is not signing
[1:56:38] the shout is not the ability to tell the
[1:56:40] secret
[1:56:50] the prophet said you are not a foolish
[1:56:52] people oh yes
[1:56:54] you are
[1:57:07] that i have a message
[1:57:09] that i have a message that i have a
[1:57:11] message he says
[1:57:14] [Applause]
[1:57:16] what is that message
[1:57:17] is that you remember says is this the
[1:57:19] time
[1:57:21] what is this the time
[1:57:23] it was the testimony of the blast
[1:57:26] that the prophet had
[1:57:28] which he thought was the end of his life
[1:57:31] are you catholic
[1:57:33] and that he so much believe it was the
[1:57:36] end of his life until he started doing
[1:57:38] valentine's declaration
[1:57:41] he told his wife how to raise the
[1:57:43] children he told the church what to do
[1:57:45] because he thought he was living
[1:57:48] that god killed them amen
[1:57:51] i'm told it is not your death
[1:57:54] it is the change of your ministry
[1:57:57] did you catch that
[1:57:59] and six months later
[1:58:01] amen
[1:58:02] it was at arizona
[1:58:04] sunset
[1:58:08] they don't want us to talk about it
[1:58:10] whatever they make out of it
[1:58:13] because the prophet told me i said you
[1:58:15] have had many theories about it
[1:58:18] he said let me now tell you
[1:58:20] what it is
[1:58:21] that telling what it is is the message
[1:58:24] of the rapture
[1:58:26] that telling what it is was not for
[1:58:28] general it was for dogs which is meant
[1:58:30] for
[1:58:31] it was meant for me
[1:58:33] that is why we believe that
[1:58:35] i don't care who you are i don't care
[1:58:38] whatever you make out of it i don't care
[1:58:40] what your research says
[1:58:42] i have proven i am proof all true
[1:58:45] i am holding
[1:59:02] that's my conclusion if you are telling
[1:59:04] the world that this rink of mystery is
[1:59:07] the smoke of an evil play you a
[1:59:09] blasphemer
[1:59:13] i'm coming close now
[1:59:15] the only thing is i won't mention it but
[1:59:17] not because i'm afraid to mention names
[1:59:20] i don't need any man's daughter i need
[1:59:23] the favor of god
[1:59:24] [Applause]
[1:59:26] but i will give unto your names
[1:59:28] but if you're among those
[1:59:30] who are advocating that this ring of
[1:59:33] mystery is the smoke of aeroblade you
[1:59:36] ain't blasphemous
[1:59:37] you are a backslider
[1:59:40] [Applause]
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:55] show us the plane give us the picture
[1:59:57] because if they protect the picture of
[1:59:59] this there must be a picture of the
[2:00:01] aeroplane and the movement of the same
[2:00:04] nonsense
[2:00:07] in the last days
[2:00:09] trying to destroy our
[2:00:11] of redemption
[2:00:12] what happened what is the significance
[2:00:14] of this world
[2:00:15] that was when the ministry changed
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:19] from the denominational
[2:00:22] messenger
[2:00:23] to love this year
[2:00:27] do you know
[2:00:28] from 1946
[2:00:31] to
[2:00:32] 1962
[2:00:34] william brown was a messenger to love
[2:00:36] jesse and job
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:52] hallelujah
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:20] for the rapture to begin with the iran
[2:01:22] must get of the same
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:26] no opinion
[2:01:27] no thoughts no ideas no appealing to the
[2:01:30] teachings of great theologians he's
[2:01:33] going to be the teaching of the mighty
[2:01:36] angel of the lamb who took the book
[2:01:40] and lose themselves
[2:01:42] come on john
[2:01:46] are you catching this
[2:01:53] there were many things within guess the
[2:01:55] ash
[2:01:56] aha yes
[2:01:59] you become quiet for me now
[2:02:01] he said it by himself
[2:02:03] there were many things
[2:02:05] many theories that teaches they are
[2:02:07] beautiful
[2:02:08] because the revelation hasn't come
[2:02:10] how about coming the white house writer
[2:02:12] of revelation 6 the lord jesus christ
[2:02:15] amen how about preaching that to the
[2:02:17] church
[2:02:18] if you call the white house brother the
[2:02:20] lord jesus christ
[2:02:21] are we not going to worship him
[2:02:25] till tonight he still did not jesus
[2:02:27] christ to many but to us we know it was
[2:02:29] the devil
[2:02:45] do you know it is my wrong reason when
[2:02:47] abraham said
[2:02:48] when those sins became open
[2:02:51] my bible in my heart became one and it
[2:02:54] was a new
[2:02:56] one
[2:02:58] amen
[2:03:02] for that book to be opened there must be
[2:03:04] mystery cloud amen
[2:03:09] brother
[2:03:10] amen
[2:03:23] amen when those things were happening
[2:03:26] william brown
[2:03:32] one or two of them is still alive
[2:03:34] the question is did it happen like that
[2:03:36] or not
[2:03:36] if it happened exactly what should they
[2:03:39] take cover for
[2:03:41] amen
[2:03:42] and seven angels came down
[2:03:45] hallelujah
[2:03:47] and they took him in the pyramids of
[2:03:49] themselves
[2:03:52] because the truth of god is known only
[2:03:54] in vietnamese
[2:03:56] so the prophet had a temporary rapture
[2:03:59] he was carried to heavenly places
[2:04:02] to show the vision of the real
[2:04:04] tabernacle
[2:04:05] the fleshly temples how they must be
[2:04:08] puked and it was brought back with the
[2:04:11] church go back east
[2:04:15] come on now
[2:04:16] wait for it
[2:04:18] you will see the advent of the foolish
[2:04:20] veterans now wait for it amen
[2:04:23] just
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:37] not to come back to jerusalem
[2:04:39] east
[2:04:41] rising of theirs
[2:04:43] amen so the sun was setting
[2:04:46] for now this year
[2:04:48] but the sun was rising for the blind
[2:05:10] because they were not meant for it
[2:05:12] you've waited all day
[2:05:15] until the sun sets
[2:05:17] hmm
[2:05:18] i will connect it to something to give
[2:05:19] you understanding
[2:05:21] you waited all day until the sun sets
[2:05:25] what were you waiting for
[2:05:27] the common bridegroom
[2:05:30] i like the word bright room
[2:05:32] because
[2:05:35] [Applause]
[2:05:46] because the bread room is the hospital
[2:05:48] of the drive
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:51] the church who had waited
[2:05:55] do you know why they were waiting
[2:05:57] do you know why
[2:05:58] let me show you why because till 62
[2:06:02] according to the message recognizing
[2:06:04] your day and its message there has been
[2:06:06] a cry
[2:06:08] for a greater revival
[2:06:10] how many ever read it
[2:06:12] church is successful you know the faith
[2:06:15] he wrote of his coming
[2:06:17] they said we need a greater
[2:06:19] revival it is not yet let's yet pray
[2:06:22] fast pray for the bible
[2:06:26] but what it takes to bring that reminder
[2:06:29] because now this is the revival for
[2:06:31] growth this is the river for preparation
[2:06:34] to go with christ what did we take for
[2:06:36] giving the church admitted we don't have
[2:06:39] it
[2:06:41] but you know at that time everybody
[2:06:43] looks like a bride
[2:06:48] because everybody was following the
[2:06:49] messenger
[2:06:51] did you catch that
[2:06:53] i knew they seemed like they all bright
[2:06:58] those who followed jesus

[2:07:28] you're getting some ideas
[2:07:30] night is coming
[2:07:31] so the bright room never came
[2:07:35] until the other day
[2:07:38] did you catch that did you catch that
[2:07:41] it is only when your night there comes
[2:07:43] that you announced it is the rising of
[2:07:45] them
[2:07:46] the rising of the sun actually announces
[2:07:48] a new day
[2:07:51] i'm bringing it for you
[2:07:52] son was setting
[2:07:55] to the church world and the tragedy was
[2:07:58] admitting
[2:07:59] we had something but it's not enough
[2:08:06] we need something more
[2:08:10] what is something how is it going to
[2:08:12] come
[2:08:13] who is going to release it
[2:08:16] they have no idea
[2:08:18] they love this young age messenger does
[2:08:20] not have that something more
[2:08:24] it takes the breakthrough himself
[2:08:27] to plummet something more
[2:08:30] hey
[2:08:33] then to announce the close of another of
[2:08:36] this day
[2:08:38] seven angels are here amen
[2:08:41] amen
[2:08:42] and say what it will take
[2:08:45] to bring that new day to prepare their
[2:08:47] bride is not available today but we
[2:08:50] shall give you the commission
[2:08:53] then walk back and announce it is the
[2:08:56] rising of our other song
[2:09:01] so the voice of the bridegroom can only
[2:09:04] be heard
[2:09:06] not on that same day
[2:09:08] in another day
[2:09:10] [Applause]
[2:09:14] behold the bridegroom
[2:09:23] the revival up to that time could only
[2:09:26] take people that far
[2:09:27] too trump is simple living trying to
[2:09:30] live
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:34] but we need something beyond love
[2:09:36] we want something that is effortless
[2:09:39] we want to come to a statue of friends
[2:09:42] that when people speak bad at us we
[2:09:45] don't struggle not to react
[2:09:47] [Applause]
[2:09:49] when people do bad to us
[2:09:51] there is no heart in us
[2:09:54] we even repent for them
[2:09:57] i have quotations for what i'm saying
[2:09:59] we stop telling god intercessory
[2:10:02] that it doesn't even mean to do it
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:08] it is the setting of the sun
[2:10:10] for struggling times
[2:10:13] for trial by hero
[2:10:15] for partial revelation
[2:10:18] for childhood milk
[2:10:20] common church amen
[2:10:24] but every congregation were there
[2:10:27] the foolish and the wife
[2:10:29] at the setting of the sun
[2:10:32] the sun went down
[2:10:36] then it was a midnight
[2:10:39] why would it be during the night
[2:10:41] because another day must be announced
[2:10:45] did you catch that
[2:10:48] another day it's been what
[2:10:51] it is the rising
[2:10:54] sunrise speaks of another day
[2:10:57] this is where the bridegroom never came
[2:11:00] amen
[2:11:02] in the second book
[2:11:04] which closed systematically at 62
[2:11:08] year 1962 that's what the prophet no 63
[2:11:12] in the message christ is the mystery of
[2:11:14] god revealed
[2:11:15] whenever that was preached the prophet
[2:11:17] said now at two o'clock
[2:11:20] this is the end of the second
[2:11:32] meaning that the dispensation of that is
[2:11:35] over it is not as safe it will no longer
[2:11:37] discern but that is not the face of the
[2:11:40] ministry any longer amen so laughing
[2:11:44] into 63 a new day was announced because
[2:11:48] the bridegroom arrived amen amen
[2:11:54] the christ is not
[2:11:56] just waiting for a physical christ
[2:11:58] their blight is in that crash now yes

[2:19:16] habit did you realize that there were
[2:19:25] [Applause]
[2:19:32] but they couldn't take the open sleeve
[2:19:34] they couldn't even wait enough
[2:19:38] to get the open seat the dream of
[2:19:40] brother junior jackson
[2:19:43] the pyramid oh am i true
[2:19:46] the pyramids
[2:19:51] amen
[2:19:52] inside this place are revelations
[2:19:55] the prophet said i always thought they
[2:19:57] were outside the bible he said but i
[2:19:59] realize that god cannot give a blessing
[2:20:01] outside of his word
[2:20:03] it takes about sin to make him know that
[2:20:06] hallelujah
[2:20:07] that is going to be the mystery content
[2:20:10] of this
[2:20:11] amen church we are not giving a close by
[2:20:15] billion believers and christians in the
[2:20:17] world are closed are carrying close
[2:20:19] fires
[2:20:20] but there's a few remnants
[2:20:22] for which this close bible has been
[2:20:24] opened until
[2:20:26] it was opened in revelation 6 and
[2:20:28] revelation 8 by revelation 10 it was
[2:20:32] completely open waiting for that bride
[2:20:35] waiting for that job to turn the open
[2:20:37] door
[2:20:39] [Applause]
[2:20:40] and do what we did
[2:20:48] [Applause]
[2:20:52] keep walking keep walking one day
[2:20:56] hey
[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:11] loose these heels is the shout out
[2:21:14] amen
[2:21:16] glory to god
[2:21:17] you love him this morning
[2:21:22] they cut it open
[2:21:24] and he said he has interpreted things
[2:21:26] written around it but he couldn't tell
[2:21:28] of that precious story that was inside
[2:21:31] it
[2:21:31] the only thing they told them look upon
[2:21:33] this and watch
[2:21:35] and what where did he started going he
[2:21:37] was going to sunset
[2:21:39] arizona amen in order to have this
[2:21:42] encounter that will give him the church
[2:21:44] to come back
[2:21:45] to serve us over in order to do what to
[2:21:48] reveal
[2:21:50] the revelation declares what a new day
[2:21:53] the rising of the sun but these these
[2:21:56] people were told to wait wait till that
[2:21:58] time
[2:21:58] come on charge the building block for
[2:22:01] foolishness
[2:22:03] the bible said while the prophet
[2:22:04] disappeared the story said why the
[2:22:06] prophet disappeared a lot started
[2:22:09] looking away
[2:22:10] amen
[2:22:12] as the enough as ignore don't ask me
[2:22:14] look for yourself
[2:22:16] by the time majority saw is gone so far
[2:22:19] they started telling themselves now that
[2:22:22] is god what do you think this means
[2:22:26] and each person each person who
[2:22:28] disobeyed the command to look
[2:22:31] started fashioning down their
[2:22:33] interpretation of what they taught their
[2:22:35] job meant
[2:22:37] that is where around the seventh seal
[2:22:38] there has been so many theories
[2:22:40] but this is the very evidence that there
[2:22:42] is the truth somewhere
[2:22:49] um hallelujah later the prophet was
[2:22:51] referring to it is i remember you know
[2:22:53] jackson's dream
[2:22:55] when i told them to wait they never
[2:22:57] waited is the reason today people are
[2:23:00] teaching things preaching things that i
[2:23:02] am not responsible for the prophet said
[2:23:07] i'm making denominations
[2:23:10] out of the rights for thanksgiving
[2:23:15] this
[2:23:19] amen
[2:23:20] the message of the short king
[2:23:25] by the temple
[2:23:27] amen amen whoever tells you that
[2:23:30] the festival of the prophet uh was the
[2:23:33] shout he told you in life that's right
[2:23:36] and you see human beings have a way of
[2:23:38] appropriating because it is three the
[2:23:41] first is uh
[2:23:44] the second is the boy the third is the
[2:23:46] trumpet
[2:23:48] would you know better than james
[2:23:51] amen
[2:23:52] it was because you thought the prophet
[2:23:55] must do everything it is christ that was
[2:23:58] doing
[2:23:59] it was christ that the prophet foreign
[2:24:02] amen himself when it does appear i must
[2:24:06] decrease
[2:24:07] and he must
[2:24:09] increase each brother which did not
[2:24:12] decrease
[2:24:14] he brought the shout on his fear
[2:24:17] and he went quiet
[2:24:20] just as john did
[2:24:22] what happened there
[2:24:23] the ministry of the laodicean age
[2:24:26] messenger
[2:24:27] gave way to the ministry of the lord
[2:24:30] jesus christ himself
[2:24:34] that was when the prophet could come and
[2:24:36] say you are not feeding on me
[2:24:39] but you are feeding on the unfailing
[2:24:41] body watch
[2:24:42] of the son of man i was not the one that
[2:24:46] appeared at while i was only the person
[2:24:49] nearest
[2:24:50] when he appeared
[2:24:52] a man is what we fail
[2:24:54] but you are not feeding on me
[2:24:57] we are feeding we are having communion
[2:25:00] on the body and blood of jesus christ
[2:25:04] that is the message of their power
[2:25:11] the mighty india took over
[2:25:13] and that was why the interpretation of
[2:25:16] the bible the prophet said came better
[2:25:18] than my own personal judgment
[2:25:20] from that moment it was no longer the
[2:25:23] thoughts or theories
[2:25:24] of willie brown or any better for that
[2:25:26] matter
[2:25:27] it became the fullness of god
[2:25:32] this was why in revelation 10 the mighty
[2:25:35] just church
[2:25:39] that is your preparation
[2:25:42] that is your rapture there
[2:25:43] that is what we give you rapturing face
[2:25:47] that was the shout
[2:25:49] that you needed
[2:25:51] to pull out the jericho walls of your
[2:25:53] life and get into your inheritance
[2:25:56] hallelujah
[2:25:58] that is the message of the house
[2:26:01] now
[2:26:03] how does this preview
[2:26:06] how does it prepare you
[2:26:08] i'll give you a time
[2:26:12] how many of us will be prepared for
[2:26:13] rapture
[2:26:17] let me just give you a trip and close
[2:26:21] this is your love dreaming now amen this
[2:26:24] is how you trim your life
[2:26:26] there was a time a king needed a queen
[2:26:30] amen
[2:26:31] they call him hazuras
[2:26:44] 127
[2:26:46] the promises of america
[2:26:48] is about 52
[2:26:50] and yet it's one of the largest nations
[2:26:52] under heaven even in science
[2:26:54] canada and i need to go
[2:26:57] in science not in population
[2:26:59] are you cutting them
[2:27:01] now foreign
[2:27:13] and the
[2:27:14] wise men said that if we allow this to
[2:27:17] go
[2:27:19] all the women will never regard their
[2:27:21] husband
[2:27:23] so vashti must not come into the king
[2:27:25] again
[2:27:27] by this
[2:27:29] spiritual denominations was put away
[2:27:32] to make room for a new brand
[2:27:38] [Applause]
[2:27:41] everything god wanted to do has done
[2:27:44] [Applause]
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:48] [Applause]
[2:27:53] was to be selected
[2:27:55] because before each bride could become
[2:27:58] queen
[2:27:59] she must be prepared to meet the king
[2:28:02] amen
[2:28:03] she must treat
[2:28:04] allah this is your love trinidad
[2:28:09] amen
[2:28:20] did you hear me
[2:28:24] the bible said it wasn't only one
[2:28:26] particular girl
[2:28:28] there were several girls
[2:28:30] who were pure vegetables
[2:28:34] they have the potential to be the queen
[2:28:36] are using the vegan concept again
[2:28:38] [Applause]
[2:28:42] let's see those who can endure let's see
[2:28:44] they watch
[2:28:46] amen
[2:28:48] this is not long time
[2:28:50] this is spiritual london
[2:28:52] enough what in the light and there was
[2:28:54] no muslim walk with god
[2:28:57] it's all about walking
[2:28:58] until you struck the king's highway
[2:29:01] let's watch it next time amen another
[2:29:03] glorious time here amen amen amen
[2:29:07] so esther
[2:29:09] was among the veterans
[2:29:12] and then
[2:29:14] for the first six months
[2:29:16] nobody had any idea
[2:29:18] they give them some cleansing materials
[2:29:22] and after the cleansing material
[2:29:25] you are now left to get appearing
[2:29:28] materials
[2:29:31] you see you see in the past six months
[2:29:33] the first full second full economy
[2:29:36] there was no discrimination
[2:29:38] everybody enjoyed this thing it is the
[2:29:40] top book that makes a difference
[2:29:43] are you catching it
[2:29:44] when it now comes to god meets the king
[2:29:47] which is the rapture
[2:30:02] on how to prepare themselves for the
[2:30:04] rapture
[2:30:05] it's in your mind
[2:30:07] [Music]
[2:30:09] yes
[2:30:12] give me this
[2:30:13] give me that
[2:30:14] everybody has to interact with one
[2:30:17] person they call him
[2:30:20] he's a chamberlain
[2:30:22] a chamberlain and you know
[2:30:24] he's got no seats forgive nobody
[2:30:27] but you see this man is not useless
[2:30:29] because this is
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:34] [Applause]
[2:30:44] [Applause]
[2:30:59] i have a message for them if somebody
[2:31:01] has been doing good for 40 years
[2:31:03] i cannot stop doing it for one year i
[2:31:06] did not came upon him
[2:31:08] what did the bible say yeah
[2:31:22] [Music]
[2:31:25] if you only work on your time
[2:31:27] you will become one you become cannon it
[2:31:30] will never move the bride
[2:31:34] you cannot intimidate these end times
[2:31:38] because this entire bride doesn't look
[2:31:41] away to a man
[2:31:42] he looks away to jesus
[2:31:44] even if god will meet his next true man
[2:31:47] yes
[2:31:48] but he looks up unto god and god touches
[2:31:51] us
[2:31:53] for nothing around his blessing we will
[2:31:56] never hold the faith of our lord jesus
[2:31:58] christ with the respect of persons if
[2:32:02] you are doing this topic
[2:32:04] because you will be able to tell the
[2:32:06] truth you will be able to stand for the
[2:32:08] truth
[2:32:09] hypocrites will never make it
[2:32:13] no
[2:32:15] be loving church
[2:32:18] you love him
[2:32:19] praise god
[2:32:21] you got the all interacted with anger
[2:32:25] in the dispensation where nothing seems
[2:32:28] different
[2:32:31] because when it comes to the rapture it
[2:32:34] becomes a message of identification
[2:32:36] you
[2:32:40] so you must get your preparation
[2:32:43] with the inspiration of your destination
[2:32:49] no matter how bad the world is getting
[2:32:52] there will be a glorious breath
[2:32:54] [Applause]
[2:32:56] because this bride came from somewhere
[2:32:58] and they must get back there
[2:33:00] and in this hour the lord will release
[2:33:03] the anointing the spirit of supplication
[2:33:06] the inspiration that will drag them back
[2:33:09] home
[2:33:10] that will tell them it is ongoing
[2:33:13] they must have the desperation that is
[2:33:16] our comfort
[2:33:18] so
[2:33:21] don't take the wrong influence you know
[2:33:23] where you are going you don't know where
[2:33:24] the next person is sitting by you is
[2:33:26] going
[2:33:29] let every man be his own body praise god
[2:33:33] [Applause]
[2:33:37] so each of this veteran came
[2:33:40] and started asking a guy what they
[2:33:42] wanted
[2:33:43] give me this give me that give me this
[2:33:46] give me that i
[2:33:53] [Music]

[2:34:03] there will be generations who are in the
[2:34:04] message yes they will be taken care of
[2:34:08] it was the same christ who took
[2:34:10] care of judah's character
[2:34:13] and was it not the same ground the
[2:34:16] dynamics and the mechanics of judas was
[2:34:18] in the end of christ
[2:34:19] and so the dynamics and the mechanics of
[2:34:22] the real 11 disciples were also in the
[2:34:24] house of christ
[2:34:26] amen
[2:34:27] is the light out every life must
[2:34:29] interact with life in order to prosper
[2:34:32] and manifest them that they are
[2:34:36] common
[2:34:40] the bible says
[2:34:44] when it comes to the tone of this
[2:34:45] particular girl
[2:34:48] they call her esther
[2:34:53] generation
[2:34:54] extra people
[2:34:56] where are you
[2:35:08] hallelujah
[2:35:09] [Applause]
[2:35:10] the prophet said
[2:35:12] when you rotated off of the body of
[2:35:14] christ in eternity
[2:35:16] you were not deceived
[2:35:18] by the one who deceived two thoughts
[2:35:21] the same was too dead in heaven so we
[2:35:23] stand here on him
[2:35:25] [Applause]
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:31] it is all the work of grace
[2:35:34] from glory to glory
[2:35:36] i love that
[2:35:38] and
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:45] nothing will happen
[2:35:47] the land will fall upon me
[2:35:49] in goodly places i must have been
[2:35:52] good i must take possession
[2:35:56] i must possess
[2:35:57] the gate of the enemy
[2:36:00] they can't defeat me
[2:36:01] i will defeat them
[2:36:04] [Applause]
[2:36:06] i was identified with joshua and killers
[2:36:09] the generations that were not deceived
[2:36:11] or influenced by the child
[2:36:14] they are my branch i will eat them i
[2:36:16] will kill them i will swallow them
[2:36:19] digest them nothing

[2:38:43] mystery class
[2:38:45] amen
[2:38:46] you know
[2:38:47] he always turned the picture
[2:38:50] sideways upside down
[2:38:52] in one way
[2:38:53] then the god who knows the right angles
[2:38:57] came and said as long as you have a
[2:38:59] slanted position
[2:39:02] you cannot see what you should be saying
[2:39:04] keep the position correct and your eyes
[2:39:07] will be open
[2:39:08] and when it bonded to the right angle
[2:39:11] behold the eyes of christ
[2:39:14] the nose of god the mouth of god
[2:39:17] brother abraham's dream
[2:39:19] and it was our lord

[2:39:39] nations to nations the blight is being
[2:39:42] guided by the message of the show
[2:39:45] and what is gathering us is preparing us
[2:39:48] walking upon the atoms of our body
[2:39:51] changing us from glory to glory until
[2:39:54] that change we come to a perfection amen
[2:39:57] and it should be a time to work for
[2:39:59] christ to do what connects the day
[2:40:03] amen so you have a job in that you're
[2:40:06] ripping it
[2:40:07] we signify the readiness to call out the
[2:40:10] dead
[2:40:11] and they will be called up by the same
[2:40:13] voice
[2:40:14] the work of lazarus
[2:40:16] how lazarus had it
[2:40:18] what it meant to him
[2:40:20] amen
[2:40:21] wait for the dead saints to rise up they
[2:40:24] will tell us about it
[2:40:25] then we hear the voice of the archangel
[2:40:28] that voice is not meant for the living
[2:40:30] saints are you listening to me
[2:40:32] the
[2:40:39] accept the simplicity of the message
[2:40:42] after the opening of the seals in the
[2:40:44] messenger rapture from the problem
[2:40:49] resurrects the saints the self-worth in
[2:40:52] john chapter 11. yes
[2:40:54] that's right
[2:40:57] it is not for you
[2:40:59] amen it is for persons who are followed
[2:41:03] when they hear it they will tell us the
[2:41:05] experience
[2:41:08] i
[2:41:09] am not fighting over nonsense
[2:41:11] amen
[2:41:12] let me deal with myself
[2:41:14] hallelujah
[2:41:16] leave their voice
[2:41:18] for those whom it is meant for
[2:41:20] because is to get them home
[2:41:22] for us to have a united gathering amen
[2:41:25] the prophet said god has so arranged it
[2:41:28] that you and i will not wait to get to
[2:41:30] heaven to see those who made it
[2:41:32] we shall see ourselves here
[2:41:34] like 30 to 40 days of fellowship because
[2:41:38] we are connected with the same material
[2:41:40] when you blend into that dimension give
[2:41:43] god thanks when you begin to see the
[2:41:46] saints who have come back you are
[2:41:48] blending to another you blend them into
[2:41:50] another dimension because it is only
[2:41:53] then you can see one another on this up
[2:41:55] for 30 to 40 days we're going to have a
[2:41:58] fellowship we're going to have a
[2:42:00] campaign we don't have a revival
[2:42:02] after which we shall do what happens
[2:42:07] to make the fifth rapture
[2:42:10] the first was enoch the second was
[2:42:12] elijah amen the tenth was the lord jesus
[2:42:16] christ the fourth was the old testament
[2:42:18] saints hallelujah the fifth will be us
[2:42:22] because as enoch was seven from either
[2:42:24] we are the seventh church age from
[2:42:27] pentecost so rapture will take place in
[2:42:30] this age their preview was seen it has
[2:42:33] been spoken it will happen
[2:42:35] there without us we are the generation
[2:42:38] paul was talking
[2:42:40] [Applause]
[2:42:44] [Music]
[2:42:48] how do we come to our preparation the
[2:42:50] prophet said watch upon what
[2:43:02] because before rapture the spirit of the
[2:43:04] lord will be withdrawn
[2:43:06] amen there have been no more salvation
[2:43:09] there have been no more repentance there
[2:43:10] will be no more conviction the voice of
[2:43:13] god's work will pour down but not to
[2:43:15] change people in the tribulation but to
[2:43:18] make them eat god's demon because the
[2:43:20] spirit of god has been withdrawn
[2:43:23] but while we can get out the spirit
[2:43:26] i invite you my brother i invite you my
[2:43:29] sister
[2:43:30] i invite you saints who are still having
[2:43:33] a crisis of up and down
[2:43:35] god can stabilize your testimony
[2:43:38] keep it consistent and growing
[2:43:40] by the message of preparation our love
[2:43:44] dreaming is to each the message
[2:43:46] is to keep checking the word to see our
[2:43:49] life don't tell me those words and we go
[2:43:52] from glory to glory
[2:43:54] until we come to full measure
[2:43:56] praise god
[2:43:58] and one day
[2:44:00] the trumpet will sound
[2:44:02] like
[2:44:06] it will be something loud and clear
[2:44:08] in such that there will be a gathering
[2:44:11] trumpet gathers the living and the dead
[2:44:14] will be resurrected with god
[2:44:16] and they will be prepared for their
[2:44:18] flight when you see us flying off our
[2:44:21] comfort zone when you see us takes
[2:44:23] dimension our truck beds are there amen
[2:44:26] and so shall we ever be with them
[2:44:28] because from the wedding supper from the
[2:44:31] rapture christ will never separate from
[2:44:33] us again
[2:44:34] we have to wait and support together
[2:44:36] we have the millennium together we sit
