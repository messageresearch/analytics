[23:35] know all the teams will being hard as it
[23:40] is we had in the last two and half days
[23:42] is about holding on to our own promise
[23:45] what a brand said that you you I think
[23:50] is actually in the book of John chapter
[23:53] eight verse that it we said jesus said
[23:56] to those disciples that believe in him
[23:58] if you continue in my word then are you
[24:02] my disciples indeed not just because you
[24:05] believe on stop the operative word is
[24:08] the continuity
[24:10] continue to believe hallelujah okay he
[24:15] bush at that array let me address you
[24:16] the way Paul addressed you he in
[24:21] accounting for you who you are believing
[24:24] on behalf of you it says wherefore holy
[24:29] presence
[24:31] but the cast of the heavenly calling
[24:33] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[24:38] our profession Christ Jesus who was
[24:42] faithful to him that appointed him as
[24:46] also Moses Mastretta
[24:49] his house for this man was counted more
[24:54] worthy of glory than Moses inasmuch as
[24:58] he that building the house had more
[25:01] honor than the house for every house is
[25:05] beautiful some man but finally he
[25:08] debuted offenses God Eman Moses was
[25:14] rattling health as accessible as the
[25:17] testimony of those things which were to
[25:20] be spoken after but Christ as a song
[25:23] although his own house whose house are
[25:27] we you and myself we are the house of
[25:32] God on one condition if we well past the
[25:38] confidence and the rejoicing of the hope
[25:42] frame onto the end by seven wealth or as
[25:48] the Holy Ghost has said today if you
[25:53] hear his voice harden not your heart but
[25:57] it's as in the provocation in the day of
[26:01] temptation in the wilderness when your
[26:04] brother tempt me and so I walked 40
[26:08] years I was pleased with that generation
[26:11] and say they are always here in their
[26:15] heart and they have not known my way
[26:17] verse 11
[26:19] sure I swore in my wrath they shall not
[26:24] enter into my rest
[26:25] first word take heed brethren lest there
[26:30] be in any of us and evil heart of
[26:34] unbelief in departing from the Living
[26:36] God first I think that's what we are
[26:39] doing this morning
[26:40] both excellent one another why it is
[26:44] good today
[26:45] lest any of you be hardened through the
[26:49] deceitfulness of sin 44 we are
[26:55] mathematic as of Christ if we were the
[27:00] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[27:03] under the and wherefore as the believers
[27:07] are said to die to emphasis a second
[27:10] time if you hear his voice harden not
[27:14] your heart for soon when they have had
[27:18] it provoked help me it was not with them
[27:24] that came out of Egypt with who was
[27:28] equipped 40 years was it not with them
[27:33] that are same with Colossus firm in the
[27:36] wilderness and to will swarthy that they
[27:40] do not enter into his rest but to tell
[27:44] that believeth not soon past 19 we see
[27:49] that they could not enter because of
[27:52] unbelief the Bible scholars had told us
[27:56] it is written in the scripture 365 times
[28:00] do not be afraid that means God is
[28:04] telling us don't be afraid every day of
[28:08] our life including Libya
[28:12] Bible permitted also be a friend Hebrew
[28:15] chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 and say
[28:18] therefore fear lest any promise being
[28:22] left us of entering into the rest any of
[28:25] you should seek the cultures of it for
[28:29] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[28:32] as unto them but the word preached did
[28:35] not profit them because it was not mixed
[28:38] with faith and then that habit god bless

[1:05:53] original faith so this morning wanna go
[1:05:56] straight to the word we wanna stand if
[1:05:58] you wanna go to Ephesians chapter 4
[1:06:00] wanna read from verse 4 to 13 1 a good
[1:06:04] Jude chapter 1 you wanna read verse 3
[1:06:07] and said mark chapter 16 you wanna read
[1:06:10] from verse 15 to 20 readin Ephesians 4
[1:06:23] we didn't from verse 4 there is one body
[1:06:26] and one spirit even as he a call in one
[1:06:30] hope of your calling one Lord one feet
[1:06:33] one baptism one God and Father of all
[1:06:37] who is above all and through all and in
[1:06:39] you all but under every one of us is
[1:06:42] given grace according to the measure of
[1:06:45] the gift of Christ wherefore he said
[1:06:47] when he ascended on high he led
[1:06:50] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:06:52] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:06:56] that he also descended first to the
[1:06:58] lower parts of the earth he that
[1:07:00] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:07:02] up far above heaven that he might fill
[1:07:05] all things and he gives some apostles
[1:07:07] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:07:09] and some pastors and teachers for the
[1:07:12] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:07:15] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:07:17] body of Christ till we all come into the
[1:07:20] unity of the faith of the knowledge of
[1:07:22] the Son of God unto a perfect man unto
[1:07:24] the measure of the stature of the
[1:07:27] fullness of Christ we would add Jude
[1:07:30] Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all
[1:07:35] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:07:37] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:07:39] to write unto you want exhort you that
[1:07:42] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:07:44] faith which was once delivered
[1:07:47] under the scenes and we go to sin mark
[1:07:49] 16 reading from verse 15 and he said
[1:07:54] unto them go into all the world and
[1:07:56] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:07:59] does believe in his baptized shall be
[1:08:00] saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:08:03] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:08:06] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:08:08] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:08:10] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:08:13] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:08:14] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:08:16] the sick and they shall recover so then
[1:08:19] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[1:08:22] was received up into heaven and sat in
[1:08:24] the right hand of God and they went
[1:08:26] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[1:08:28] working with them confirming the word
[1:08:31] with signs following amen
[1:08:33] may God bless his holy word you may be
[1:08:35] seated so this morning I have a title
[1:08:48] unity of the original faith restored by
[1:08:52] Malachi 4 that's my title this morning
[1:08:56] unity of the original faith restored by
[1:09:00] Malachi 4 I never thought contending for
[1:09:03] the original faith defeat and I believed
[1:09:07] in my heart and I'm looking forward for
[1:09:09] it that there is going to be a unity of
[1:09:12] D faith that's what the Bible says that
[1:09:15] the five for ministry gonna be here
[1:09:17] until we all come into the unity of the
[1:09:19] faith so all the issues in the message
[1:09:23] was supposed to be sorted out by another
[1:09:27] Ephesians another Ephesians was to bring
[1:09:30] us all on the same page because when it
[1:09:34] come to Ephesians become to one Lord one
[1:09:36] faith one baptism it has nothing to do
[1:09:41] with interpretation doctrine and men's
[1:09:43] idea it's gonna be one Lord it will be
[1:09:47] one thing it wanna be one baptism
[1:09:50] all praise the name of the Lord Oh
[1:09:52] hallelujah are gonna be seated praise
[1:09:54] God glory to God amen
[1:09:57] so Berta manaman adoption he's talking
[1:09:59] about sons and he's talking about the
[1:10:02] right kind of a son not just sons that
[1:10:05] war kind it have AB accident sons
[1:10:08] renegades sons disobedient sons
[1:10:10] rebellion sons all sons but adoption is
[1:10:14] the right kind of sons not the right
[1:10:17] sermon the right kind of sons he's not
[1:10:20] adopting the sermon he's adopting the
[1:10:23] man he's not adopting the position he's
[1:10:26] adopting the man
[1:10:27] Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[1:10:31] you have to find a man that he wanna
[1:10:34] adopt oh praise the name of the Lord we
[1:10:37] believe that you may be seated and my
[1:10:40] mom says now when the guy when the Sun
[1:10:42] is the true Sun and so on and got tests
[1:10:45] him and try him and go on with the
[1:10:48] setting mode this is what he said it's
[1:10:49] no secret we all see it when a man
[1:10:52] proves that God loves him he takes him
[1:10:57] out somewhere to himself and in the
[1:10:59] front of angels do something for him he
[1:11:03] lifts him up in the presence of God and
[1:11:06] gives him and fills him and sesamum that
[1:11:11] is the age we are living in or glory to
[1:11:15] God hallelujah praise God so in 1906 the

[1:15:33] this group of church that will draw the
[1:15:35] rest of them from the greatest there
[1:15:38] will be a resurrection so brother
[1:15:40] Branham 1954 he said so tonight I
[1:15:46] represent the I back up a little
[1:15:48] bit now we are moving right into another
[1:15:50] great age somebody read this one coming
[1:15:55] for the rapture of the church a thing
[1:15:56] about a burrito I mean this we are
[1:15:59] living in a time of the restoration of
[1:16:01] the gifts it's humble many a big design
[1:16:03] churches it's sent the Nazarene
[1:16:05] backwards it makes my not over the
[1:16:07] Pentecostal but just the same God is
[1:16:10] moving right on bringing in listen
[1:16:13] bringing in the rapture in the faith for
[1:16:15] his church bringing it in
[1:16:18] what that's right so tonight listen I
[1:16:23] represent that hate wallet Paulette
[1:16:26] listen listen I represent that faith the
[1:16:30] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:16:33] scenes
[1:16:34] in the way of a divine gift this is very
[1:16:41] important you may be seated
[1:16:43] he was saying tonight I represent that
[1:16:47] faith by way of the gift what he's doing
[1:16:54] here
[1:16:54] he said the gift is demonstrating and
[1:16:57] showing something representing the faith
[1:17:00] but the faith is coming because the
[1:17:03] faith could only come by the breaking of
[1:17:05] the seals if we saw back the faith what
[1:17:15] they had is not a Fiat now it is defeat
[1:17:20] we want to emphasize that people
[1:17:22] regional one not be Pentecostal one not
[1:17:26] they have not the ones they have all
[1:17:27] wrong and on the TV right now not that
[1:17:30] that is not original original is alpha
[1:17:34] original is what people had original and
[1:17:38] silver and gold have I none such as I
[1:17:41] have I give it unto you
[1:17:44] North never move and I said so Oh glory
[1:17:49] to God that's your rhythm of a
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:04] hooray glory love God
[1:18:08] you may be seated and this fate is the
[1:18:12] purpose you have this regional this feat
[1:18:15] is based upon forgiveness so God put us
[1:18:18] in this age here
[1:18:19] the ears are bloody love where people
[1:18:22] will get cut or finalize that is what
[1:18:30] miss you and I and we are challenged to
[1:18:34] forgive we are challenged to drop the
[1:18:38] Lord's because we have to come to the
[1:18:41] faith and space participants or get the
[1:18:47] Lord I stroke
[1:18:47] [Applause]
[1:18:58] maybe season
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:12] but a Branham may be seized with numbers
[1:19:15] on the restaurant and he saw this woman
[1:19:18] and he began to condemn and say Lord is
[1:19:22] that's the kind of place my child when
[1:19:24] the raise up in and so on like that and
[1:19:26] God taught it on his shoulder pull him
[1:19:29] aside give him a vision showing when he
[1:19:33] was sworn his sins coming up to God and
[1:19:37] the blood of Jesus like a bumper
[1:19:40] bouncing at all and there again God
[1:19:42] wrote forgiven but company see
[1:19:45] forgetfulness and God said I forgive you
[1:19:49] and you condemn her so he himself had
[1:19:53] was to be fully fit into perfe kindness
[1:19:57] into the spirit of forgiveness it's not
[1:20:01] just saying I forgive you it's a spirit
[1:20:04] it's an annoying it's a it's something
[1:20:09] that has to be real when God sees it do
[1:20:16] you know what we are saying this morning
[1:20:18] we have to have faith to pull down
[1:20:21] charity
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:29] maybe see them we have to have faith to
[1:20:32] pull down the capsule if we have to
[1:20:35] leave it in the rapture we have to pull
[1:20:38] down the cap because charity never
[1:20:40] faileth so it has to have a certain
[1:20:42] atmosphere and the Prophet said a woman
[1:20:45] when she's about to give birth
[1:20:47] regardless if she's a prostitute it
[1:20:49] doesn't matter what kind of woman a
[1:20:50] sweet spirit comes around her before she
[1:20:54] has that baby and if that sweet spirit
[1:20:57] is not a wrong you maybe you're not
[1:21:00] pregnant maybe you're not ready maybe
[1:21:03] having come to full turn but once you
[1:21:06] come to full turn once you are ready and
[1:21:08] right now this morning we are pregnant
[1:21:12] with God we are pregnant but Messiah and
[1:21:18] once you are come to fulfill a sweet
[1:21:22] spirit sweet anointing forgiveness it's
[1:21:26] to be their father forgive them they
[1:21:31] know not what they do or get the Lord a
[1:21:34] shock even Jesus even Jesus manifested
[1:21:42] it even Jesus expressed it this is it
[1:21:58] that peace upon forgiveness Oh glory to
[1:22:01] God I think it's in a message for the
[1:22:06] brown school Baram says rapture and fate
[1:22:11] will only be revealed to those who
[1:22:13] forgive their brothers
[1:22:16] [Applause]

[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:29] and bringing these virtues into you the
[1:25:33] scenes Oh God maybe season the Spirit of
[1:25:48] God is not something it can't be cooled
[1:25:53] into you
[1:25:57] the spirit can't be cooled into you so
[1:26:03] all this teaching can teach the spirit
[1:26:07] unto you he said it is something that is
[1:26:11] predestinated into you by the hand of
[1:26:14] Almighty God your experiences cannot be
[1:26:22] schooled or taught into you
[1:26:24] it is predestinated look at brother
[1:26:27] Branham walk into the house of God two
[1:26:31] people carry on making love in the
[1:26:32] church Holy Spirit drop down whatever
[1:26:36] you see whatever you see whatever you
[1:26:40] see up someone blame option to death
[1:26:45] absent record even more the up service

[1:27:00] Lord drop down what do you see
[1:27:07] you see white Bordeaux on the default
[1:27:10] because it's right now we are saying the
[1:27:13] wrong thing
[1:27:19] what the peloton says he said I forgive
[1:27:24] you no no no we can't even get I can
[1:27:31] attest because a decoy : people hope one
[1:27:33] time those people will get thrown on the
[1:27:36] church we can't even get that kind of
[1:27:38] test we can't even get a pants wearing
[1:27:40] woman test to come inside the church
[1:27:42] because she got dressed right
[1:27:44] oh she don't want the dress she's a
[1:27:46] sinner the spirit and the bride say come
[1:27:53] whosoever will let them come to the door
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:13] well maybe season when we lust for
[1:28:16] knowledge it's a sin to do so it's a
[1:28:22] strong statement this one my message
[1:28:25] sit-ins eating butter brown now
[1:28:31] someone's tree into this messaging lust
[1:28:33] for knowledge but the Bible prophesy
[1:28:35] that their people last happen kitchen
[1:28:37] ears you want to know easily dismiss
[1:28:40] tree that they can understand and Christ
[1:28:43] is the mystery of God reveal I have read
[1:28:50] and preached so much a deep stuff and
[1:28:52] I'm not nothing about the life stuff is
[1:28:57] because butter bottom said it I do not
[1:28:58] the coat yet he said the mysteries was
[1:29:00] revealed that we couldn't see the
[1:29:03] plainness of God and know how to behave
[1:29:05] ourselves in the present day that we
[1:29:09] live in hell
[1:29:09] the mysteries are not revealed for
[1:29:12] information sake it's revealed that we
[1:29:15] can see the plainness of God and know
[1:29:18] how to behave so it come back to a
[1:29:23] behavior that God must approve Oh glory
[1:29:27] to God amen shiburin says the thing I
[1:29:31] meant today we don't try to establish
[1:29:32] the Word of God in the people's heart we
[1:29:34] try to establish ourselves or churches I
[1:29:37] trying to establish the doctrine of the
[1:29:38] church in the person's heart we are
[1:29:40] commanded to establish the Word of God
[1:29:42] you may be seated
[1:29:43] Paul said any good Paul I didn't come to
[1:29:46] you with enticing words of man that your
[1:29:49] faith might rest on the knowledge of the
[1:29:51] man I come to you can power and
[1:29:54] manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:29:57] your faith might rest in God so Paul was
[1:30:00] careful that the people not impressed
[1:30:02] with his knowledge and information and
[1:30:05] revelation as opposed to having
[1:30:07] confidence in the power that got to use
[1:30:10] him
[1:30:11] hallelujah God can use that man of God
[1:30:13] and deal with your heart and deliver
[1:30:16] your spirit and free your soul by the
[1:30:19] power of Almighty God Alleluia and the
[1:30:22] word is the conductor of the spirit so
[1:30:25] that's why the word was fought and the
[1:30:27] spirit could follow that word and bring
[1:30:30] that complete deliverance he said
[1:30:33] establish the Word of God take all the
[1:30:35] unbelief and establish the king of God
[1:30:36] in on my heart and the kingdom of God
[1:30:39] can be established in a man's heart
[1:30:40] least what me that man does Oh God when
[1:30:44] the Son of man cometh shall he find that
[1:30:46] feet on the dirt he said we store the
[1:30:48] feet of the children back to the feet of
[1:30:50] the father's original word back to the
[1:30:56] faith of the father's original word Oh
[1:30:58] glory to God not if it was delivered
[1:31:02] he said defeat and defeat was once a
[1:31:06] better the Saints not a field people say
[1:31:08] is against my faith there's only one
[1:31:10] fate there's only one law
[1:31:13] so what are we against what is people
[1:31:15] against in this message when there was
[1:31:17] only one fate become the priest I picked
[1:31:19] this morning there's only one fate or
[1:31:22] glory to God hallelujah praise God we
[1:31:25] believe that now the only way that we
[1:31:28] ever want to know if we can find out
[1:31:30] what the fate is then we can ill Missy
[1:31:33] contention that fate no the faith was
[1:31:36] once delivered if you go back to where
[1:31:38] they were first called scenes and what
[1:31:40] the fate was what they come have the
[1:31:41] content for and that would church to say
[1:31:44] which means sanctified they had a faith
[1:31:46] there we go
[1:31:47] in our resurrected living Christ someone
[1:31:53] who rose from the dead and was living
[1:31:55] among them just to see him as he was
[1:31:57] before he died it wasn't contented for
[1:31:59] some historical of fear but they were
[1:32:01] contending for a living Christ who was
[1:32:03] in their myths
[1:32:04] get a little while the were seeing me no
[1:32:06] more but you shall see me and that is
[1:32:09] what the Apostles believed they believed
[1:32:11] that he was in the flesh and he was more
[1:32:14] in the spirit that is what they taught
[1:32:16] that is what they believe
[1:32:18] the practice and that is what God
[1:32:20] confirmed and that's the very faith this
[1:32:24] that we had in the beginning is supposed
[1:32:26] to be today that same fate in a
[1:32:30] resurrected Christ not just talking
[1:32:32] about brother Branham but talking about
[1:32:35] now right now say it in the living
[1:32:39] Christ among the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:42] Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:32:45] oh yes listen to this we have had plenty
[1:32:49] past were plenty trucks and theology
[1:32:51] around the world let's call it spoken
[1:32:54] word books
[1:32:55] let's call Bibles Jesus Jesus Jesus said
[1:33:08] go into all the world and preach the
[1:33:11] gospel to every creature
[1:33:13] but around then he meant to go in the
[1:33:16] world and demonstrate the power of God
[1:33:21] that's the gospel or blowing it for a
[1:33:24] stubborn man preach you say you know
[1:33:26] what I'm waiting on I'm waitin on he's
[1:33:29] alone all glory to God and he's talking
[1:33:32] I'm just talking and he is talking all
[1:33:34] of a sudden say he is here yes yeah he's
[1:33:38] I take every spin
[1:33:42] Gloria listen this
[1:34:48] in order to preach the gospel before you
[1:34:53] can make it a customer preach you have
[1:34:57] got to have the power and demonstration
[1:35:00] of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel
[1:35:03] the letter killeth the spirit make it
[1:35:06] align it is not a ritualistic of fear it
[1:35:10] is absolutely a real living reality of
[1:35:14] the resurrection of Jesus living among
[1:35:18] men and that's the faith
[1:35:21] I'm trying my best to contend for today
[1:35:25] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:35:28] today and forever and this power is
[1:35:31] unlimited
[1:35:33] so the Prophet said missing limbs will
[1:35:37] be restored
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:35:41] do you have faith for that missing limbs
[1:35:45] will be restored
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:55] seems like people are more faith any
[1:35:57] doctors that in God
[1:36:00] doctors say take six bills four pairs
[1:36:02] Reapers to take all the pills without
[1:36:04] question about question take this twice
[1:36:08] a day
[1:36:09] treat them today whatever they are you
[1:36:10] doing everything in the Gaza but God
[1:36:12] said you shall lay hands on the sick
[1:36:17] and they shall recover what is the god
[1:36:21] of miracles he forget the miracle this
[1:36:23] morning he's still work miracles he's
[1:36:26] still open the blinds he's still
[1:36:29] crippled the world he's still netiquette
[1:36:32] Oh Diaz clock this morning

[1:38:59] all glory to God is none rise hallelujah
[1:39:03] praise God so you may be seated
[1:39:05] so dude hallelujah spoke about
[1:39:09] contending for this faith that was once
[1:39:10] delivered under recipherus they had was
[1:39:13] the manifest they couldn't ready money
[1:39:15] has that faith until they went to the
[1:39:17] upper room to receive the baptism of the
[1:39:18] Holy Ghost
[1:39:19] isn't that right and that faith produced
[1:39:22] another book of Acts it wasn't the acts
[1:39:25] of man it was the acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:28] operated through men and the book of
[1:39:31] Acts had no leader the book I had has no
[1:39:33] headquarters and had no bishop and had
[1:39:36] no mighty book message van it had
[1:39:39] nothing like that
[1:39:40] it was the acts of the Holy Ghost and my
[1:39:43] 10 sons of God and directing them and
[1:39:45] leave them as to what to do and what a
[1:39:48] banner prophesied there'll be another

[1:53:39] let's continue praise go from Juba jira
[1:53:42] 1962 is one of my favorite quotes he
[1:53:45] said we are waiting for something that's
[1:53:47] going to take the feet 1962 he seen
[1:53:52] being beaten on something that's what
[1:53:54] take the feet and we saw the feet of the
[1:53:56] cheering back to the original
[1:53:58] Pentecostal tree all the denominational
[1:54:00] crease eats it down
[1:54:01] God said I will restore it in the last
[1:54:04] days it will be restored get a prophecy
[1:54:07] God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a
[1:54:11] way upon planted with that it will
[1:54:14] restore so we still come in from these
[1:54:18] seven thunders but we going on deeper

[1:54:54] of the Spirit not by God not by night
[1:54:56] but by my spirit says the Lord not by
[1:54:59] organization not by denomination but by
[1:55:01] the Holy Spirit God will bring the tooth
[1:55:04] in the last days
[1:55:05] or glory to go to all these teachings
[1:55:08] and all these revelations it has to be
[1:55:10] converted something has to change or
[1:55:13] glow in a glowing butter brown wasn't a
[1:55:15] mountain a blast went for three blasts
[1:55:18] one two three he said the Brethren heard
[1:55:21] the blasts but I heard the voice the boy
[1:55:27] said judgment striking Westeros the
[1:55:37] Brethren who the blasts so they get one
[1:55:40] last revolution like for myself well
[1:55:56] glory no God is how its interpreted
[1:56:00] Scripture voice of one time the
[1:56:02] wilderness that's the word
[1:56:03] but that's also a jug we'll just shall
[1:56:07] conceive that's the word but that is
[1:56:09] merely what Malachi 4 6 that's the word
[1:56:14] that's you the children who has to be
[1:56:18] chained
[1:56:19] back to the fate of the Pharaohs that's
[1:56:22] in the book but that's yeah this morning
[1:56:25] your hats literally glory to God you
[1:56:32] will be seated from a recognizing idea
[1:56:34] this message national force but Israel
[1:56:36] in the homeland national force or put
[1:56:38] the church and the work into the
[1:56:39] churches but the power of God will put
[1:56:42] the people in the bride Oh glory to God
[1:56:45] it will take the power of God to put the
[1:56:49] people in brand then he spoke about an
[1:56:51] adoption he's talking about coming on
[1:56:53] and and the mothers being placed
[1:56:55] groaning and the labor pains and so on
[1:56:57] he's in our church go to labor pains
[1:57:00] they get tremendous sometimes I went a
[1:57:02] church is groaning under the persecution
[1:57:05] of the outside world they're leaving on
[1:57:06] the Lord Jesus that the promise of the
[1:57:08] Holy Ghost is just as real as it was the
[1:57:11] Pentecost and this is the problem I
[1:57:13] don't hear people talking about it
[1:57:15] that's just such a real Oh glory to God
[1:57:17] I want what Peter had just what Paul had
[1:57:20] those brothers had it but everyone came
[1:57:23] that we kind of go forward until we go
[1:57:25] back and pick up what they have we have
[1:57:26] to go and pick up the field that they
[1:57:28] have because that is the original City
[1:57:32] its original turn to face the rapture
[1:57:41] those guys were adopted those guys have
[1:57:45] the Holy Ghost but time ran out on them
[1:57:47] and they fell into the ground but be who
[1:57:50] are live and remain alive and renamed
[1:57:58] shall attend to them
[1:58:00] he said hold a groan and cry in the
[1:58:03] river pains but when they are born
[1:58:05] unprofesional e born into the church
[1:58:06] into the kingdom of God then the Holy
[1:58:09] Ghost sets in the church some apostles
[1:58:11] some prophets some teachers some passes
[1:58:14] snip Angeles praise God
[1:58:16] then he give it to destigmatize praise
[1:58:19] God hallelujah interpretation
[1:58:21] and tongues and O'Connor miracles oh
[1:58:23] please hallelujah praise God so when the
[1:58:28] Son of man cometh shall he find faith
[1:58:29] yes because all that dwell on the earth
[1:58:32] shall be received except the names
[1:58:34] written in the Lamb's Book of Life for
[1:58:36] the foundation of the world or glory the
[1:58:39] one if your name is written you will act
[1:58:40] like it you will do like it all praise
[1:58:43] be to Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:58:45] praise be to Jesus very few will to
[1:58:49] recognize the name on the book John saw
[1:58:51] his name and John had a behavior free is
[1:58:54] called you could yeah kind of missing
[1:58:56] the early church failed because the
[1:58:58] people take the anointing are they
[1:59:00] taking magic of the people and put it on
[1:59:01] a man we better become a poop Nicole
[1:59:04] eaten and then become a doctrine then
[1:59:06] become a man and the church fell away
[1:59:07] from that God his organization he hits
[1:59:10] the domination he hits a man that is
[1:59:14] like button on top but his affinity of
[1:59:16] the local church because once it go to
[1:59:18] this bishop and Archbishop and somebody
[1:59:19] higher and man is man man is still man
[1:59:21] he still one power still one power
[1:59:24] without character but God is still God
[1:59:26] he will give you power with character or
[1:59:29] glory record him and lets up be the name
[1:59:32] of the Lord we believe it oh praise God
[1:59:35] hallelujah so this morning we are free

[2:05:53] season we going back to the faith it's
[2:05:57] impossible to please him because he that
[2:06:00] cometh to God must believe for my solar
[2:06:03] system this morning systems what I
[2:06:06] believe in reality and the people
[2:06:12] imagine a failed in seven where is your
[2:06:15] God Oh
[2:06:18] Oh God see if I can hit the home stretch
[2:06:22] here oh thank you lord
[2:06:28] what about only u19 time ensign is to
[2:06:30] the church and the bride in the world is
[2:06:31] becoming one until the world itself is
[2:06:34] working on the work of the breakroom
[2:06:36] he said no watch God u19 time remember
[2:06:40] there's a uniting of the world bringing
[2:06:44] back the faith that was once delivered
[2:06:46] to the Saints bringing it back and it
[2:06:49] can all be done in this day the only
[2:06:51] time it could be done is right now it
[2:06:53] never was attacked anywhere else they
[2:06:56] went off on the anomalous breeze you may
[2:06:58] be seated I want you to get this
[2:06:59] this is supremely important trans
[2:07:02] important
[2:07:03] he said no watch it never attacked
[2:07:05] anywhere else they went off on
[2:07:07] international streets but now it don't
[2:07:11] belong to no denomination Street because
[2:07:15] it is the time it is time for you
[2:07:18] nineteen of men and women of every race
[2:07:20] every color every Creed everything under
[2:07:26] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:07:29] and back to the world
[2:07:33] so you're tapping a doctrinal and try to
[2:07:36] say we don't believe the same doctrine
[2:07:38] therefore we can't our fellowship you
[2:07:40] can't do that now not after this there
[2:07:42] is a uniting on the Christ like the
[2:07:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost say if the
[2:07:48] fire falls on you and the fire falls on
[2:07:52] me what will happen
[2:07:56] god fire is on you and fire is on me

[2:08:30] early church age did they ever see the
[2:08:31] things we have seen today here we go and
[2:08:33] this was only me possible when God sent
[2:08:38] the seven seals and give us a sign by it
[2:08:41] and since seven angels down from heaven
[2:08:43] and come back to bring that scattered
[2:08:46] word in dem denominations and tie it
[2:08:49] back into the Word of God again to bring
[2:08:52] down his holy spirit
[2:08:53] so here what are you saying the seven
[2:08:56] angels came to gather all the scattered
[2:08:59] world to tie it back into the word
[2:09:02] what's the purpose to bring down the
[2:09:06] holy spirit so the objective is the
[2:09:10] captive holy spirit to the people that's
[2:09:13] the target that's the objective
[2:09:15] that's the ball the spirit come to the
[2:09:18] people we see nations u19 we see the
[2:09:28] world unite and praise God we see the
[2:09:30] pride unite in uniting with the word why

[2:11:27] I believe she is sealed into the kingdom
[2:11:29] of God I believe the mechanics is here
[2:11:33] they are waitin for the dynamics of
[2:11:36] reticula of the content of the rapture
[2:11:38] he is a dynamic so you can't go anywhere
[2:11:41] without him because he is the dynamics
[2:11:44] that he is not a bishop that he is not a
[2:11:48] man that he is not a message Pope that
[2:11:53] he is dynamics glory of God we watch we
[2:11:58] just become members of the Machine of
[2:12:00] his body swarming ourselves into his
[2:12:03] image and see you 19 himself with us in
[2:12:07] his works the dynamics of this church
[2:12:09] will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[2:12:14] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:12:17] while the headstone is coming down to
[2:12:20] unite with the body and went ahead and
[2:12:22] bought unites together the full power of
[2:12:25] the Holy Ghost would raise our so the
[2:12:28] head connects with the body and the full
