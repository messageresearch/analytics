Jesus we ask it amen God bless you if the Bible is when I get it into the one scripture Luke chapter 24 we want to read from verse 49 to 53 thank you so much for coming out tonight and creating such an atmosphere Luke chapter 24 I want to read from verse 49 to 53 and this is Jesus words in verse 49 is read Luke 24 49. and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tari in The Siege of Jerusalem until you've been jeweled power from on high and you let them out as fast to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple prison and blessing God Amen may God bless his word you may be seated o praise the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus tonight our title is the attitude that brings the results is the attitude that brings results and I have an inspiration on the atmosphere of Jose perfection I want to encourage you tonight to stay in the wood stay in the atmosphere of the word if you're in the wrong atmosphere you cannot get the results that you're looking for so we want to share some things with you tonight that we feel upon our hearts that will help you and strengthen you and edify you and the prophet was spoken about a message a personal experience with God 1954 and it was chained about Moses how Moses has been a bit had been a bit of failure for yet knowing that God is going to the liberation of Israel by him yet trying to do it within himself 40 years before that become a failure had lost all the vision of Victory and of the freedom of the people enslaved see when you lost the vision you you just doesn't have the burden anymore to do what needs to be done because if God call you qualified job he called you to enlist you into his program his Plan of Redemption isn't that right and the prophet I wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that God is promised to deliver the church from its Sin from its sickness and to make us our people our salty people and the Earth will hunger and thirst after I wander in our human efforts in our theologies and so forth our great fine buildings and so forth as we try to present the people many years ago we found it has failed because we took it in ourselves to do so we took it upon ourselves to have new schools educate ministers we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was to let the Holy Spirit lead the church we have left that off we have lost our divine joy and division is dull now so when that Joy is there you can't wait to come to church you can't wait to be in service you can't wait to be in the presence of God because this is your Source this is your inspiration this is where you're getting your join from isn't that right people are not looking for the coming of the Lord yet atomic bombs hanging everywhere people have lost their vision of the Lord because they have set times that the Lord will come a certain time and I've done all these things how can we do those things without the Holy Spirit Moses have been a bit of failure but oh dear we see the tension attracted to a burning bush it's not right fire attracts the people now watch Fear take a hole right quick when Moses turned aside to consider this building tree God spoke to him a fresh Vision By An Angel so when revision get done sometimes God have to give you a fresh word a fresh anointed a fresh inspiration a fresh fire amen that I'd still you up again to the vision of God that God has put inside your soul that's what the church need tonight watch watch now watch Faith take a hole right quick the old things pass away Moses no has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience vision revelation and experience he had met God he had talked to God before that he had not met God he only read and knowed what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother told him but what the pastor said but now Moses had a personal experience so you read this book with books you're not going to Prophet Elijah like what you read that's what you receive that's what you understand but now you have to get your personal experience with God not reading a book not listening to a tape but with the same Pillar of Fire Oh Glory to God because that's still a fire come to activate the sons of God Oh Glory to God could somebody say Amen that Pillar of Fire come to activate the sons of God so you should want to be God activated oh not intellectually activated God has like every scripture is God breed the Breath of God is upon this word oh Hallelujah that's what the church needs tonight is stop studying so much Theology and get them to the Altar and pray until a personal experience building down in a human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a new vision Oh Glory to God we need a fresh altar call every man at the altar every man repented every man crying out Bible said enjoy let the priests hold on to the horns of the altar let him cry for the wine and cry for the oil and then God said in Joel too and I will restore to you the years that don't look as eaten the Palmer woman eaten when after they cry out all glory to God he said what we believe in the prayer meeting to say Lord send on the adoption God we are teaching for 40 plus years it's time for fire it's time for power Oh Glory to God we have to create the atmosphere because the atmosphere is what you're gonna get the results [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God Amen maybe seated praise God praise God amen faith in God it's a staggering to many people and we ought to be ashamed ourselves to confess we don't have faith in God first there's cowards who died ten thousand deaths while they're here on Earth hero Never Dies his memory lingers on for his Eric deeds and usually there we go people who are Faith are people who have experience experience brings faith Oh Glory to God you hear what you hear that experience brings Faith so when Moses met that Pillar of Fire nobody could stop Moses to tell him and talk him out of going back to Egypt and if they asked Moses where are you going he said to take over Oh Glory to God what he couldn't do in 40 years he was doing instantly because he met the pillar of fire and barabanam stood and prophesied he said God will do in one year what all theologians failed to do in 2000 years you wait till that little Remnant that God's gonna give that Elijah we Pinnacle to call him God can be a national Showdown there'll be a power strike the church that you have never seen before you wait it's coming it's coming it's coming Oh Glory to God these are not plain words every word is a seed he said wait till them servant on this after their voices that that people who could take the word and hand it there Oklahoma strikes and cut they can shut the heavens they could do whatever they want to do [Applause] we don't have to ask permission for God to deliver your family we letting your family go you say Pharaoh let them go you are free tonight loose them and let them go Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah not the preacher experiences your experience you have to get your own experience and your experience Being Fit when then goes in our Prophet says back to the faith of the fathers that when we have go back to an experience that the father has had because they had an experience Hallelujah and Jesus send them in the upper room they give them the promise of the father and the Bible said they were in the upper room they were praising and blessing God continually what were they doing they were creating an atmosphere and they were staying in the atmosphere it all depends upon your attitude that's gonna bring the results but we have to create an atmosphere the atmosphere is what makes a difference oh the song leader was singing tonight and he didn't know what to do the anointing and building is the atmosphere a takeaway the blues if we move your frustration it affects the bad day you had today it corrects all of that what this does it is the atmosphere of the Holy spirit that was her power the episode of God we need that atmosphere you want that atmosphere you want it in your house you want it in the kitchen you want it when you leave out when you leave the home you walk that atmosphere [Music] [Applause] [Music] you want to bring your home under that atmosphere let's continue the wood is a seed Mexico Fellowship 1955 and the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground so the sea is not the problem is the atmosphere or the ground right wrong everybody sit on top of here it's not going at all because it's not for seeds like that that is something else see that to go in the right gone wrong it's not right you got if you're afraid to sow it the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of God is a seed you said so and every promise of God will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it and can place it in your heart and believe it come from God and water it with fade it will Spring forth of its kind don't never forget the statement and make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass [Music] don't forget that don't forget that all glory to write attitude that woman Jesus call a dog is not fit to take the children's bread and Castle the dogs she stood right there she didn't move she and we'll hold the building or the pastor or the Elder she Becks because of what Jesus tell her she stood her guns right there she said even the dogs that comes off the master's table she was locked in she was focused she had the right attitude she was in an atmosphere of faith that nothing wasn't moving her nothing could throw off nothing can affect because she had a need that Terror was upon her daughter and she wore that devil off or give the Lord I shout do you have a knees here tonight [Applause] do you have a need I need a break show I need a Deliverance I need a healing I need a restoration I needed the joy of God I needed the Holy Ghost I need a Revival I needed a fresh Vision whatever your need is tonight he can supply your needs tonight oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the only thing you have to do is to water the seed and you water the seed by worship you wanted to see by Praises that's why a lot of churches don't know the church has said they did not see their watering they only hearing word word word but that they can act most here praise God of watering of worship that's why we every time we come say Give the Lord a shout of praise because some point in time we have to have this continually you can't help it it's like automatic once you come inside I hear you just have to worship God you don't care who are the side of you who in front of you if you just lost your pay or if they fired you that have not been with it the devil is a liar praise God you're not you're not serving God because you're getting paid you're saving God because you call it the serve him no [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not tomorrow right now knows it is [Applause] the water to see you you put me on record tonight in these recorders I have no apology for this remark I'm fixing to make I believe and can prove that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right attitude the attitude is what brings the results [Music] [Applause] [Music] the attitude is what brings the results [Applause] Elijah Elijah walk up there with a woman who went and takes some stick and eat one bit more big for sure she's on to die and he said big me a kick first yeah she had a choice she gotta say listen this little brain are going to make here it's on me and my boy this is our final supper that's it she could have said that she said but she went and turned in obedience to pick that man of God a big face and when she turned she had dusted the Lord what the little you have go multiply whatever you got I will multiply [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right Hallelujah the attitude is what brings the results Martha Mary Law if it had been here my brother had not died [Music] she pushed him she push him she pushing first gear secondly but even now and when she pushed that get even now and she's throwing that girl Jesus couldn't help it where have you laid him my God you anointed me with resurrection power you anointed me but the Dynamics to the mechanics [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus in the wedding wine run out and they come to Jesus what he has to do with that he's a guest like everybody else but his mother said whatever he say just do it don't question it don't argue with it don't fight it just do it he said get some waterproof enjoy it and when inside the poor water you see water you're seeing wine he can turn water into wine he could change your word and turn it into Revelation and give it the stimulation of the revelation of the wine of God oh come on say Amen somebody you could be a jazz a biscuit but if the Lord come Among Us he could turn that water into wine here [Applause] water into wine praise God for the Brandon says that the attitude is Supernatural the attitude of the people is what brings the results the attitudes about somebody coming a bad spirit you see because the religious man the carnal man have a religious atmosphere around him did not saying only coming to church the spirit on them they don't want to stay home they come in the church but they come to church get trouble Hallelujah religious atmosphere they like to worship they like this singing and things like that but when you see a boss of water correct them they fly out they can't take extraction they can't take rebuke the tactic correction but every scripture is God breathe and it's profitable for Doctrine for rebuke for correction because Jesus had as many as I love [Applause] because you have to get a replacement of your spirit oh man my my my my [Applause] listen listen justification is the atmosphere to know that you are saved and God save you God bring you into that atmosphere that's what Luther did sanctification bringing a higher atmosphere now you are saved you are Sanctified then the Holy Spirit coming to baptize you to bring you to a high atmosphere and then the prophet brought the word to drop Joseph Perfection a Capstone word into the Holy Ghost atmosphere to cap your life we have to press on Brethren from Jacob Grace into True Perfection we have to press on because we have to get them to the resurrection if we take Perfection to get there okay the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] the people have to be in the Revival [Music] let the people shout right now foreign you you my brother you my sister you have to bring your heart wants fair and you have to break it from your house you have to bring it from your home you can't bring it here you have to bring it from home you gotta bring it from home get the Lord a praise offering [Applause] [Music] that's a big order tonight what we're saying you may be seated I'm saying this atmosphere have to be in your home I suppose they have to be in your home you have to have the right attitude what we're saying because this is what they must want you must want the atmosphere in your home and you just add fire on it you add to it you're meditating on the Lord blessed is the man oh glory to God hallelujah who walked up and the constant then Godly no stand in the way of Sinners nor sickness save this cornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in that law that he meditate day and night what's happened to that man he's in an atmosphere oh God he is blessed the word is around him he's in a word atmosphere or glory to God but Abraham was in the atmosphere when that Maniac man was coming to beat him up ministers run off the platform but whatever I'm still in the atmosphere he didn't run because the devil backing up no Son of God no devil backing up no sun that coldness hour come on we are here to back them Devils up wherever I'm still in the atmosphere the glory to God he said because you challenge the spirit of God you shall follow my feet and demanded the atmosphere [Music] why you think the devil has initiate quarrels and forces and family Quarries in the home to show you all the atmosphere when you all the atmosphere you don't want to come to church your facts you're angry you can't sing nothing you don't throw you off already because you miss his objective so instead of cooling youngest one and coolness what you add in fuel to Fire and the query getting hotter like if that is something to do be sweet en them with his foolishness get creative atmosphere and get him out of that he had a hard day grumpy he ain't want to come home sweet you create the atmosphere when he come he say I'm happy to be here than he because you studying you because you are a tough day home I I didn't come in foreign I didn't come here to go into that I'm coming to talk about the atmosphere and I find myself going down inside the deer oh hallelujah praise God create the atmosphere drop it drop it you don't have to answer back you don't have to pick on every little thing and you're hanging on your thing in here and you're thinking here because you have a mouth shut up keep my still tongue oh I'm not the perfect man be the Bridle his tongue or give the Lord a shock don't know what I'm saying it tonight but I'm excited there already oh glory to God a perfect man could handle that tongue Oh Glory to God that tongue can speak death or life Speak Life speak Deliverance speak very true speak love speak fire speak pray true [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's the reason the reason at Pentecost they had to go in an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came cause they got in one place and one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results aha all right attitude bring the results and the atmosphere bring the results so God sent them there to wait until they have the right atmosphere because Holy Ghost can't come down and dry holy ghosts they take an atmosphere to meet the atmosphere [Music] listen listen when Jesus died those guys were under depression and frustration and all kind of thing like that because they must have gone who cried who's sad and organizing like that even the woman the sisters had more Revelation expression than some of them brothers because the Angels tell them sisters go and tell them I'm Not Dead then let me raise from the dead them Runner with message and brother saying a separate touch and I feel I will not believe you know what talking about like president who follow in Jesus you know he said I touch and feel sister they feel nothing they say we've seen him he's risen we see him when Jesus appears to them he said come come you wanna touch come and touch come on touch don't run now come and touch he says I be not afraid so when you meet them talking the negative talk and Jesus doesn't he say rebuke them he saw fools and slow of heart to believe all what I said this was showing you all the time that I have to suffer these things I even tell if I don't go recover that will not come now that I'm here I'm showing you now be confident coming now they're happy because they Comfort they're going about to come so when he tell them behold I send the promise of my father they knew exactly what they was going to receive power power [Applause] you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost the comforter the token the Dynamics Rebecca's Veil come upon you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and they returned to Jerusalem half depressed and frustrated no with great joy I like that not Joy great joy happy you should be happy praise God are you happy I saw you happier than the president of your United States of America Donald Trump don't have joy like you have joined right now he don't even know what he has right now he has problems that have a problem that other problems but you have joy because you're coming into Power you communicate your promise you come into anoint him oh glory to God there'll be a super race there'll be a super church that's a prophecy hallelujah or glory to God the bride has not a Revival yet it will take them seven Thunders to pick up that Pride that's a promise laying over you what we see here to make a church that should make a Revival that we will find them everywhere that said the seven thunders of Revelation 10 is being made manifest [Applause] Oh Glory to God [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah Glory you know what's happening be closing the Talking part of the message and we're moving into the manifestation part because in the talking talking but the manifestation will be the interpretation of what the prophet said this is that Oh Glory of God that is what we need to hear this is that but the prophet William Brown unspoken [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he is standing present right now and you will see something happening that will cause headlines and newspaper in the morning he said that's right it's the atmosphere if we get it right headlines gonna be made because the pillar flag will hang right over this building Glory [Applause] you really believe that part of it yes sir I rarely believe that same Pillar of Fire that hung by night called by day to hang right over there [Applause] let the world know he is with you [Applause] that the whole attraction I know he is with you that's a God we serve he's a living God he's a moving God he's a supernatural God he still heals he still seals he still delivers he still break the pants of wickedness he still break the pants of evil he still deliver sisters from Bullhead spirits thank you he is God and God Alone [Applause] he said you could take an egg for my hand and put it under a puppy it will hatch he said it's the warmth of the puppy's body it is the atmosphere oh Gloria you heard what he said put that egg on the puppy you're gonna hatch and produce a chicken because it is Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God and it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and the powers of God Among the people it is the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place that the reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and they all talk and don't know where they stand half of them are even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right so for this world to be fulfilled it has to bring an attitude in God's people that would create the atmosphere that he could step into it do you understand what happened in the upper room my God damn and the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one mind they were in one Accord Mary wasn't playing more spiritual than brother James and she's the mother of Jesus no God gave Mary some days to get that thing off of her shoulder all these stuck up things that she is whatever Jesus she had to die out to that every man Jack had to die Peter had to die everybody was on the promise in that room are Apostle and past and prophet and teacher every man just waiting for fire every officer was waiting for power every gift was written to be placed glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord I shout oh nobody had in this one and bigger than this one [Applause] [Music] if Peter was in his human Spirit he never stepped out after receiving the Holy Ghost but Peter knew he had the keys Peter no he was placed so he stepped out and said these people are not drunk as his opposed but this is that that the prophet Joel spake of oh my God one day we're gonna identify the manifestation of these courts it wouldn't just be caught in the prophet it should be saying this day the scripture is being fulfilled in your ears you have people being set free when when when John the Baptist was getting old and and his eyes hit and dim and John disciples then Jesus are you the one or should we look for another you know what Jesus tell them go tell John tell John the blind received their sight people walking dumb speaking here say I am he just tell him the manifestations that is taking place tell him about the supernatural working power of the Holy Ghost tell him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I trust tonight go create a test in you for a reality a manifested reality of the glory of God a money you gotta meet him [Music] but I'm talking about the woman where the blood issue she had a blood issue and she told herself If I Could Touch the Hem of His Garment money ran out his husband tell her don't go to that small church and there are noisy people ranting and raving and carrying on things like that don't go but she had enough are these blood losing things she knows she time is gonna be short she told herself she created a promise for herself she never see there's no scripture she told herself something instead of saying I go there I go there tell yourself something now tell yourself something nice pick and say something right 10 seconds tell yourself you get the Holy Ghost don't save I will sit there and bomb I'd no no no don't talk like that come on come on now I have the right I don't speak like that my situation all messed up now tell yourself God going to sort out your situation but he can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen to this yes a woman touches garment she was healed with the blood issue a soldier spit in his face and put a crown of thorns on his head and felt no virtue they roughen up Jesus no vote you coming to them and a woman that bless you just stay touching him of His Garment and vote you flow right out and heal that woman then he said it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that is what it says tonight dear friend it takes the attitude are you ready we are and believe we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but as the attitude that brings the results are you ready the mechanic is here and so is the Dynamics if you can just get started God will do the rest so get service tonight is to get you is to get you is to get you give the Lord a shout get started foreign [Applause] my God I feel like jumping I feel like shouting because I believe you're getting started tonight [Music] [Applause] if you only get started calling you the rest [Music] maybe season [Music] that's what David did when Goliath coming down they will run to make a lot and they will put this thing in the stone no it's not no David not the first time David it's not the first time he's in stone you know sling is a sting they were a custom busting Stone targeting bottle targeting whatever it is what's up you see a man on a tree and he just mango come off bullseye you have experience with beer with Lion you have experienced the boss one line here the lion shake so and you take him out is the next contestant to be taken out you have to get the experience [Applause] so you view the trials differently you view the situations differently you shoot your view situation in your life differently your things are overcome things that stand things to back up not things that break you but to make you oh give the Lord a shout your experience and trials is to to make you to shape you to form you into the wood image the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics if you can get started go over do the rest oh my my hallelujah praise God what's the matter today my version is this we are letting down we are listening down to mental theology we're listening down to intellectual faith when we ought to pray until God moves in the audience and does and goes to do something for us had one service but ramanam came to our meeting he never even pray or preached he said as soon as he's walking to the service people said they come with a wheelchair he said the angel was present the atmosphere was there sometimes they see people around talking about this milky white anything happen all things are possible pillar fire moving Faith reaching up everywhere demons calling out the other demons for help because they don't want to go and a prophet with authority there to cast out devils and those demons know this man is signed and assigned to cast them out and they ask if a backup praise God you think on demons easy write them Church they're asking each other for help oh because they don't want to leave you think that devil have in your life and influence in your life all these years he wouldn't just give up on you just like that we have to break the power of the enemy we have to pray and the world does that the word does that the word does that the atmosphere does that break them Devils off of you then you raise up the praise God people don't want to pray this God is demons have them done demons have them bong but when God break that offer you up goes those hands because you were born to worship you were born you were created thank you [Applause] what about um the greatest pleasure I know is to pray until I realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the
