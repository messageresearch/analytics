[37:57] man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[38:01] and fell among Thieves which striped or
[38:05] stripped him of His Garment and wounded
[38:08] him and uh departed leaving him half
[38:13] dead and by chance there came down a
[38:16] certain priest that way and when he saw
[38:19] him he passed by on the other side and
[38:22] likewise the Levites when he was at the
[38:25] place came and looked on him and passed
[38:29] by on the other side but a certain
[38:33] Samaritan as he Jour it came where where
[38:36] he was and when he saw him he had
[38:39] compassion on him and went to him and
[38:42] bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
[38:45] wine and set him on his own beast and
[38:49] brought him to an in and took care of
[38:52] him and on the tomorrow when he departed
[38:55] he took out two pens and gave them to to

[39:00] him and whatsoever thou spendest more
[39:03] when I come again I will repay thee
[39:07] amen let's please turn to the Book of

[39:26] tonight
[39:33] Joshua chapter
[39:35] 2 I would like to read from verse 8 to
[39:39] 17 and I'll pick few more verses from
[39:42] Joshua chapter
[39:44] 6 and before they were laid down she
[39:47] came up unto them upon the roof and she
[39:50] said unto the men I know that the Lord
[39:53] had given you the land and that your
[39:56] terror is falling upon us and that all
[39:59] the inhabitants of the land faint
[40:01] because of you for we have heard how the
[40:05] Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea
[40:07] for you when you came out of Egypt and
[40:10] what you did unto the two kings of the
[40:12] hamit that we on the other side Jordan
[40:15] seon and OG whom he utterly destroyed
[40:19] and as soon as we had heard these things
[40:22] our hearts did melt neither did there
[40:26] remain anymore courage in any man
[40:29] because of
[40:30] you so meaning that they believed what
[40:33] they heard for the Lord your God he is
[40:36] God in heaven above and in Earth beneath
[40:40] now therefore I pray you swear unto me
[40:43] by the Lord since I have shown you
[40:45] kindness that ye will also show kindness
[40:49] unto my father's house and give me a
[40:52] true token and that you will save Al
[40:55] life my father and my mother
[40:57] and my brethren and my sisters and all
[41:01] that they have and deliver our lives
[41:04] from and the man answered her our life
[41:08] for
[41:10] yours is our business and he shall be
[41:13] when the Lord had given us the land that
[41:15] we will deal kindly and truly with the
[41:19] then she let them down by a C through
[41:21] the window for her house was upon the
[41:25] town wall and she dwelt upon the wall
[41:28] and she said unto them get you up get
[41:31] you to the mountain let the pursuers
[41:34] meet you and hide yourselves there 3
[41:36] days until the pursuers be returned and
[41:40] afterward you go your way amen finally

[47:36] bless the Servants of the Lord tonight
[47:39] if the Lord will be our help which I
[47:41] trust you will I would like to speak on
[47:44] a subject which I
[47:47] called the making of Jericho's
[47:52] cause Jero became
[47:54] aaed that's what we want to look
[47:57] [Music]
[48:05] the Lord Jesus Christ was given the
[48:08] parable in the Book of Luke chapter
[48:13] 10 I'd like to let you know that it was
[48:16] Christ himself
[48:18] speaking and in this Parable was talking
[48:21] of a
[48:23] man who was
[48:25] traveling wrong
[48:28] direction the Bible said he was going
[48:32] from
[48:33] Jerusalem to Jero
[48:37] Jero a normal
[48:39] Journey should always be from
[48:43] Jero
[48:46] Jalem don't worry you will appreciate it
[48:49] as we go on but a normal
[48:52] Journey should be a
[48:55] direction from from Jericho J to
[48:58] Jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem is on the
[49:02] hill if you travel to Israel even
[49:04] physically by geography you can't travel
[49:08] into Jerusalem you are sent into
[49:11] Jerusalem is on the hill while Jericho
[49:14] is in the
[49:15] valley so people should when you are
[49:18] traveling from Jerusalem going to
[49:21] Jericho you are descending or you are
[49:25] condescending but when you are going
[49:27] from Jericho to Jerusalem you are
[49:35] ascending I like the song I like the
[49:38] song that says I'm pressing on the
[49:41] upward Way new HIDs I'm
[49:45] gaining still praying as I'm onward
[49:48] bound Lord plant my feet
[49:55] on but the case of this man of this
[49:59] brother instead of going from Jericho to
[50:03] Jerusalem he was coming from Jerusalem
[50:07] to
[50:08] Jericho he was traveling on a wrong
[50:12] direction why was it the wrong
[50:15] direction because Jerusalem is the city
[50:19] of the
[50:20] Blessed why while Jericho is the city of
[50:24] the
[50:25] ca you cannot be leaving
[50:28] blessing and accepting a cause you must
[50:32] be moving out of your
[50:34] causes amen whether generational or
[50:38] individual and going into blessing so
[50:42] for a man to be doing a reversal of trip
[50:45] it's a wrong
[50:49] direction and I see want to tell you
[50:51] tonight that Jericho has got nothing for
[50:54] you because we shall find out what
[50:57] Jericho is
[50:58] tonight it has got nothing for you if
[51:01] you will ever be blessed at all you must
[51:04] come into
[51:07] Jerusalem and every true Seed of Abraham
[51:10] Longs for
[51:12] Jerusalem because it was their father's
[51:16] teaching to long for Jerusalem If
[51:20] Abraham never left anything at all for
[51:23] his generation he left them the the
[51:26] Legacy the inheritance of
[51:30] Jerusalem it was the mark of the
[51:32] beginning of the Journey of Faith when
[51:35] the Lord told Abraham to leave the land
[51:37] of the
[51:38] childes to a land that he was going to
[51:41] show him God had that place in mind he
[51:45] was going to show in
[51:47] Jerusalem because it is in Jerusalem
[51:50] that Resurrection will take place it is
[51:53] in Jerusalem that oh friends Hallelujah
[51:57] even do you
[51:59] know that your Eternal place of is
[52:03] going to be on that same
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:07] spot you are not going to live eternally
[52:10] in heaven no no no no we are going to
[52:13] live eternally on the
[52:16] earth and because you are the Bride of
[52:19] Jesus Christ it is the good desire of
[52:22] your god of your husband to give you
[52:26] your AB Bo in the capital city that's
[52:29] right I want the church to know that
[52:31] there is going to be degree in
[52:34] eternity you are not going to live as a
[52:37] second class citizen in
[52:40] eternity but whether you agree with me
[52:42] or not there will be second class
[52:44] citizens in
[52:50] eternity you don't believe
[52:53] that there will be second class citizens
[52:57] it is not a slip of tongue I said it so
[53:01] you can coach me I said there will be
[53:04] second class citizens in
[53:07] eternity but I believe tonight I'm
[53:11] speaking to First Class
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:19] delegate let me tell you the blessings
[53:21] of first class delegates they are going
[53:24] to have a rapture
[53:26] they will be
[53:28] there they will be in the wedding supper
[53:31] they will enjoy the Millennium and when
[53:34] eternity comes they will live inside for
[53:37] S
[53:37] [Applause]
[53:43] City but second class citizens they will
[53:47] make Heaven quite all right but they
[53:49] will never make it by Rapture am they
[53:52] will miss the Millennium they will miss
[53:54] the wedding supper and they will never
[53:57] live inside the four S City that's right
[54:00] there will be Nations around the city
[54:04] and they have got to have Kings over
[54:06] them Hallelujah where you living every
[54:09] day Hallelujah they will not be able to
[54:12] come inside it is only their King that
[54:15] will come in once in every
[54:18] [Applause]
[54:23] cycle and when there come on in every
[54:26] cycle the only svir they will
[54:31] take maybe from your own
[54:34] garden the Tree of Life
[54:38] leaves just the
[54:40] leaves just the leaves to go and show to
[54:44] their
[54:45] subjects here we have healing there will
[54:48] be no more war there'll be no more
[54:50] problem we are together
[54:52] permanently but that is all they could
[54:54] enjoy of the first quar city aren't you
[54:58] a privilege
[54:59] [Applause]
[55:07] people whether you take it figuratively
[55:10] as the Heavenly Jerusalem don't forget
[55:13] it will be
[55:15] here or you accept it as the Heavenly
[55:18] Jerusalem on Earth it will be here and
[55:20] that is what make Jerusalem the city of
[55:23] the Blessed would you want to leave that
[55:25] for something
[55:28] else so what do you think of this man
[55:30] here who was leaving Jerusalem I'm
[55:33] coming into Jericho a city of those that
[55:37] are
[55:38] caused he was
[55:41] [Applause]
[55:45] backsliding let me say this very
[55:48] well this land of Israel or Jerusalem or
[55:52] Palestine or
[55:55] Canaan for God to get it for the people
[55:58] of
[55:59] Israel it cost God a
[56:02] lot the Redemption of that land wasn't
[56:07] cheap pharaoh and his army had to perish
[56:11] in the Red Sea because they tried to
[56:13] stand on the way is that right the
[56:17] Waters of Jordan had to open up God had
[56:21] to create water from The Rock he had to
[56:24] send Man From Heaven
[56:26] he did so many things waved every
[56:30] Supernatural because he wanted to give
[56:32] his people an
[56:34] inheritance and because the the
[56:36] Redemption wasn't cheap that was why God
[56:40] commanded every true Israelites that no
[56:43] matter what happened don't leave that
[56:45] land because it's my god-given land to
[56:49] you stay in there
[56:58] and when times are bad when times are
[57:00] good those who have heed that
[57:02] instruction have always come out
[57:06] Victorious now me and his family
[57:09] disobeyed that
[57:12] instruction you know what they came up
[57:14] with by the testimony of Nami she said I
[57:16] went out full but I came back
[57:22] empty meaning that God wants you to stay
[57:25] there
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:27] there no matter what happen stay
[57:31] there because that is the city of your
[57:34] blessings let's follow this man when he
[57:38] left that place the prophet
[57:42] said for us to have our ground today he
[57:45] said we have a ground today called the
[57:48] secret place of the most high and this
[57:52] ground is the ground of the message of
[57:54] the hour and then we are also under
[57:57] instruction from the message invisible
[58:00] Union brother Bram was talking about it
[58:03] he said the pilgrim fathers were looking
[58:05] for a land where they could have freedom
[58:07] of worship he said but today spiritually
[58:10] speaking God has given us that land and
[58:13] he say you and I must stay in
[58:18] there because that is the part to
[58:21] Eternity now this great economy of God
[58:26] uh I do not have a board here so we can
[58:28] call it like a ring here like a
[58:31] circle I always use this as a type why
[58:34] because eternity brother Braham said is
[58:36] like a ring now you are not called to
[58:39] stay
[58:41] outside you are told to stay inside is
[58:45] that right now the power of the church
[58:49] is as long as they stay
[58:52] inside because inside means protection
[58:56] inside means
[58:58] Authority as long as you stay inside the
[59:01] devil will only be a bluffer in your
[59:05] life whether you are praying against the
[59:07] enemy or you are not praying against the
[59:10] enemy as long as you abide in the word
[59:13] you have an automatic
[59:20] protection it is not much of your
[59:22] prayers that God actually wanted it is
[59:25] much of your
[59:32] obedience you love him tonight now when
[59:35] you stay inside here before the devil
[59:39] can get you he has to undergo what you
[59:43] underwent to stay inside here do you
[59:47] know that for you to be inside here you
[59:49] will ordained in the very thought of God
[59:53] as a predestinated seed
[59:56] at an
[59:57] helect an ordained to this very
[1:00:02] salvation Satan must meet that
[1:00:05] requirement the reason you can be born
[1:00:07] again tonight the reason you are born
[1:00:10] again is because there was something to
[1:00:12] be
[1:00:17] quickened let me tell you church if you
[1:00:20] are born without this thing to be
[1:00:22] quickened you can never ever be born
[1:00:25] again
[1:00:27] it is not the new birth that makes you a
[1:00:30] child of God what the new birth does is
[1:00:33] to bring you to the
[1:00:35] realization that you are a child of
[1:00:44] God you were always a
[1:00:46] son and you have been ordained a son
[1:00:50] even before you were
[1:00:52] manifested because in the thought of God
[1:00:56] he had you in mind he has the picture of
[1:00:59] who you want to be who he wants you to
[1:01:01] be he ordained it right within him and
[1:01:05] because the thoughts of God are
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:09] Eternal let me tell you something about
[1:01:12] God's
[1:01:15] thought they said thought what is
[1:01:19] thought
[1:01:20] Express now if I promise this brother if
[1:01:24] I think in my heart to buy a thigh for
[1:01:27] this brother and I did not say it out
[1:01:30] you know nobody
[1:01:32] knows even himself does not know so he
[1:01:35] cannot hold me
[1:01:37] responsible if for instance I'm not able
[1:01:40] to do it I will feel free because I
[1:01:43] haven't mentioned it to
[1:01:45] him but that is the thought of a
[1:01:48] man the thought of God is
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:52] different when God thinks about anything
[1:01:57] whether he says is out or he does not
[1:02:00] say it out he holds himself
[1:02:08] responsible that is why brother Braham
[1:02:10] said the thought of God is as real as
[1:02:14] his
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:20] word and this is why if you were in the
[1:02:23] thought of God which I believe you are
[1:02:26] this is why you are manifested this is
[1:02:29] where you were born by your parents this
[1:02:31] is why you are here tonight there is
[1:02:34] nothing under Heaven that could have
[1:02:36] stopped your
[1:02:37] coming even when you were conceived and
[1:02:41] if your parents ever thought that it was
[1:02:43] a mistake and they attempted aborting
[1:02:46] you you will be un abortable because you
[1:02:49] are the thought of God you cannot abort
[1:02:53] you cannot stop the thought of God
[1:02:56] Is that
[1:03:10] real so God put you in his thinking and
[1:03:14] that is why you are manifested now when
[1:03:16] he thought about you he never thought
[1:03:18] about you as a
[1:03:20] sinner he thought of you he conceived
[1:03:23] you because he is the holy God
[1:03:26] he conceived you as a
[1:03:31] saint but when you were born here
[1:03:34] because of the condition of your birth
[1:03:37] which was a permissive
[1:03:39] birth it was a permissive process but it
[1:03:43] remains
[1:03:47] unacceptable even though God permitted
[1:03:49] it he refused to accept it that is why
[1:03:53] he says You must be born again
[1:03:58] if he accepted your first birth he will
[1:04:01] not make it a must for you to be reborn
[1:04:05] he allowed it but he will never accept
[1:04:08] it but because of the condition of that
[1:04:11] birth you came here without a fighting
[1:04:13] chance now what was breath in you was
[1:04:16] your flesh by your parents but your soul
[1:04:21] came from
[1:04:22] God now God takes the picture of you by
[1:04:26] your soul not by your
[1:04:28] flesh and that was why when you became
[1:04:31] manifested the Reckoning of God for your
[1:04:34] life is in relation to your
[1:04:37] soul no matter what your flesh is doing
[1:04:42] God refused to accept
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:49] it God refus to recognize it now if this
[1:04:54] is not true then there there is nothing
[1:04:56] called true
[1:04:58] justification God was looking at it but
[1:05:01] you see the reason he followed you
[1:05:02] around in does your Reckless living is
[1:05:05] because he has a deposit inside of
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:09] you so it was the deposit of him that
[1:05:13] connected
[1:05:15] you and when you do your funny funny
[1:05:17] things he just do like
[1:05:20] this some things might be embarrassing
[1:05:23] he closes his eyes and when you are over
[1:05:26] he still following after you why because
[1:05:29] you are his thinking now when people are
[1:05:32] looking at you ordinarily you don't look
[1:05:34] like somebody who could amount to
[1:05:36] anything
[1:05:38] spiritually but God told Samuel you look
[1:05:41] at faces I look at the
[1:05:47] AR and as long as God looks at your
[1:05:50] heart he sees his
[1:05:51] representation he sees his Gene
[1:05:56] and by that Jin he continue to follow
[1:05:58] you knowing all the time that you will
[1:06:02] come to your
[1:06:04] realization so your ordination was unto
[1:06:08] life before the devil could get in here
[1:06:11] his got to have the same ordination but
[1:06:13] he doesn't have it the reason you could
[1:06:16] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:06:19] Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:22] is because you were predestinated
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:26] so if the devil wants to come in here he
[1:06:28] got to also
[1:06:30] repent he got to be baptized in the name
[1:06:32] of Jesus Christ he got to receive the
[1:06:35] Holy Ghost if he's able to do that he
[1:06:38] will no longer be devil he will be your
[1:06:40] brother but Satan cannot
[1:06:43] repent one of the attribute of Satan is
[1:06:47] that he cannot
[1:06:49] repent and as long as he cannot repent
[1:06:52] he cannot go further as long as he
[1:06:55] cannot go further he cannot come inside
[1:06:57] so he will remain outside you will
[1:07:00] remain
[1:07:06] inside stay inside Church of the Living
[1:07:09] God now when you take a notion to come
[1:07:14] outside like these men here that we have
[1:07:17] just
[1:07:18] read the first attitude of God is not to
[1:07:22] attack
[1:07:23] you God doesn't behave like that
[1:07:26] us you say how do you know you can
[1:07:29] travel to the Garden of
[1:07:31] Eden when Adam fell out of favor by sin
[1:07:36] the first attitude of God was not even
[1:07:38] to attack or to
[1:07:41] condemn Adam sinned and ran away is that
[1:07:45] right now he is supposed to be the one
[1:07:48] looking for help but he never even
[1:07:51] waited for help to come he ran away but
[1:07:56] when God came he was the one
[1:07:59] looking for his own son meaning he is a
[1:08:03] god of
[1:08:04] reconciliation
[1:08:06] hallah brother brah said God's first
[1:08:08] attitude is to woo you and plead with
[1:08:12] you and have conference with you to
[1:08:15] bring you back
[1:08:18] inside because he knows you are not safe
[1:08:22] outside you are only a strong Church of
[1:08:25] the the Living God as you can abide
[1:08:28] inside so that is the first attitude of
[1:08:31] God son come back inside daughter come
[1:08:34] back inside don't stay outside it's not
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:41] safe it is when you reject God's
[1:08:44] provided plan for reconciliation that
[1:08:48] God takes it further you know why we
[1:08:51] have to take it further because it
[1:08:53] cannot lose you
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:59] you do you know Jesus already offered
[1:09:02] Thanksgiving over your
[1:09:04] life read your Bible he said father I
[1:09:07] thank you because all that you gave me I
[1:09:11] lose
[1:09:17] none isn't that what is said how can he
[1:09:21] offer Thanksgiving on my life and
[1:09:24] recount his Thanksgiving
[1:09:26] he will not be better than
[1:09:28] me because that means he doesn't know
[1:09:31] the end from the
[1:09:32] beginning but because he knew the end
[1:09:35] from the beginning he knew that I cannot
[1:09:38] be lost so he offered an advanced
[1:09:42] Thanksgiving on me on you that
[1:09:47] Thanksgiving cannot be withdrawn so this
[1:09:50] is why he cannot lose you whatever it
[1:09:54] takes he must get you
[1:10:03] inside the prophet went further to say
[1:10:06] you might as well also hear this he said
[1:10:09] if you wouldn't mind him instead of him
[1:10:12] to ever allow you to slide into
[1:10:15] blasphemy he's got one more
[1:10:19] option you want to hear that he's going
[1:10:23] to take you off the scene
[1:10:29] aha aha it is still his goodness because
[1:10:34] he cannot afford to lose you he's got no
[1:10:37] replacement for you in his
[1:10:40] kingdom so friends let's stay
[1:10:43] inside so this
[1:10:45] man who was supposed to be in here in
[1:10:49] his Jerusalem started
[1:10:52] descending when you reject the wi of God
[1:10:56] the next guest you will meet will not be
[1:11:04] Angels if you are becoming spiritually
[1:11:06] stubborn let me remind you you wouldn't
[1:11:09] see Angels after you reject God
[1:11:12] reconciliation plan and it doesn't
[1:11:14] change the fact that you are a child of
[1:11:16] God
[1:11:19] uhhuh the next people you will see are
[1:11:21] the people this fellow saw thieves and
[1:11:24] robbers
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] and you know who the thief and the
[1:11:30] robber is if you don't know read John
[1:11:33] chapter
[1:11:34] 10 Jesus call him the devil so he's
[1:11:38] going to come with his agent and they
[1:11:40] are going to M you they are going to
[1:11:42] wound you they are going to Hur you so
[1:11:45] bad and leave you half
[1:11:49] dead there are so many moving cses all
[1:11:52] over
[1:11:54] Inu they alive but they are dead all
[1:11:58] over Nigeria they are there all over the
[1:12:01] world they are there brother Braham said
[1:12:03] half dead means physically alive but
[1:12:06] spiritually
[1:12:10] dead so they left this man so
[1:12:14] wounded because he was traveling in the
[1:12:16] wrong direction he shouldn't be going to
[1:12:19] Jericho Jericho has nothing good for him
[1:12:23] but you see it was this condition of
[1:12:26] half death that brought him his
[1:12:29] Blessing because the first thing that
[1:12:31] did was to stop him on that
[1:12:34] journey and while he was wounded in the
[1:12:36] middle of the road he be everybody
[1:12:39] became helpless until the Good Samaritan
[1:12:43] came the prophet said that Good
[1:12:45] Samaritan was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:51] himself and he cleaned his wound and he
[1:12:55] washed him and he dressed him with the
[1:12:58] first age and started looking for an
[1:13:01] inkeeper
[1:13:03] Hallelujah we've got many inke Keepers
[1:13:06] tonight the pastors are inke
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:11] Keepers he was able to get one and he
[1:13:14] took this man there and he said treat
[1:13:17] him at my
[1:13:21] expense that means this boy or this man
[1:13:25] will enjoy unlimited
[1:13:29] treatment because my father is rich in
[1:13:32] lands and houses he holdeth the wealth
[1:13:35] of the world in his hands of rubies and
[1:13:38] diamonds of silver and gold his cers are
[1:13:42] full his God riches
[1:13:45] Untold treat him at my
[1:13:48] expense I'm going to give you two
[1:13:51] pennies the spirit and the word
[1:13:55] oh may God bless the
[1:14:02] pastors God knowing god knowing what it
[1:14:06] takes to treat the
[1:14:08] wounded he gave them the spirit and the
[1:14:12] word meaning
[1:14:15] that if you don't have the spirit and
[1:14:19] the word you cannot treat this end time
[1:14:22] wound
[1:14:27] it is not
[1:14:28] programs it is not
[1:14:31] devices it is the spirit and the
[1:14:35] word when people are getting Wayward
[1:14:38] what they need is the spirit and the
[1:14:44] W nothing more nothing less we need the
[1:14:50] proper diet of the word we need the Holy
[1:14:54] Spirit God will take care of the
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:58] rest the two pennies are the spirit and
[1:15:02] the word and he said if you need any
[1:15:05] other thing when I return I will had
[1:15:10] more so if you are wounded tonight there
[1:15:13] is hope for you come for the Spirit come
[1:15:16] for the word and you will be
[1:15:19] F you love him
[1:15:23] tonight but then church
[1:15:27] that is just a background this is where
[1:15:29] we are going why did Jericho became ACC
[1:15:39] caed why wasn't it like
[1:15:43] Jerusalem because ordinarily if you read
[1:15:46] about the history of Jericho is a
[1:15:49] wealthy
[1:15:51] City and it's a Gateway City
[1:15:55] where they enjoy enormous tollgates so
[1:15:58] you may hardly find a poor man as a
[1:16:00] citizen of
[1:16:02] Jericho but despite all this credential
[1:16:05] God bless you brother and L despite all
[1:16:07] these
[1:16:09] credentials this city became Aur
[1:16:15] why and from here be I begin to draw a
[1:16:19] parallel because you must know that the
[1:16:22] stories of the Bible are not stories
[1:16:25] like your
[1:16:29] novels it is the story of
[1:16:33] life and this entire bundle of story of
[1:16:37] Life the conclusion is that they are
[1:16:41] prophecies they are shadows of things
[1:16:45] that are to come brother brah said they
[1:16:48] represent your Shadow and today you
[1:16:51] represent the reality
[1:16:57] so why did Jericho became a
[1:17:00] cause there were some people who were
[1:17:03] called The Exodus
[1:17:06] people how many knows we in another
[1:17:10] Exodus we've been through exoduses in
[1:17:12] the Bible and we're in the third and the
[1:17:15] final
[1:17:16] one the first Exodus God was calling a
[1:17:20] nation out of a
[1:17:22] Nation the second Exodus he was calling
[1:17:25] a church out of religion and in this
[1:17:28] last one is calling the bride out of the
[1:17:34] church now the prophet said the reason
[1:17:37] we need to look at the first Exodus
[1:17:39] critically is because this is the last
[1:17:42] day and the last day will vindicate the
[1:17:46] first day meaning that the first Exodus
[1:17:49] was a seed Exodus whatsoever was planted
[1:17:53] there will come to full harvest in this
[1:17:57] last
[1:18:01] Exodus you will realize
[1:18:04] that brother BR brought to us the truth
[1:18:07] of serpent seed is that right and it
[1:18:11] looked like a Greek when he was saying
[1:18:15] that one woman within the space of a
[1:18:18] period became impregnated by two beings
[1:18:22] Adam and the serpent is that hot but
[1:18:26] thank God for
[1:18:28] election that makes us believe hot
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:33] things now 1958 was the year the
[1:18:38] prophets publicly and directly without
[1:18:42] drawing
[1:18:43] inferences preached
[1:18:46] Serpent and in order for God to back up
[1:18:50] the prophet God allowed a white woman
[1:18:54] to be
[1:18:56] impregnated by two men black and
[1:19:00] white that was the first time it will
[1:19:02] happen in the world
[1:19:04] history and this woman gave birth to two
[1:19:08] children of two races one was completely
[1:19:12] black and the other was completely
[1:19:15] white and uh it became a puzzle the
[1:19:19] white husband came and said I'm just
[1:19:22] going to be responsible for my son
[1:19:25] because this one is my color so it
[1:19:28] fitted perfectly white versus white he
[1:19:31] said I don't know about this one and the
[1:19:33] woman had to confess that I was with my
[1:19:37] husband over the night then I went to
[1:19:39] play with my boyfriend who was a black
[1:19:41] man at some point and in the interval of
[1:19:45] hours she became conceived by two
[1:19:48] men now it startled the world but one
[1:19:52] man was not startled
[1:19:55] the prophet came back to the church he
[1:19:57] said have you seen what has just
[1:19:59] happened it was the last day vindicating
[1:20:03] the first
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:07] day if we were not in the Garden of Eden
[1:20:10] to see what happened we are back here in
[1:20:13] our centuries and seeing the same thing
[1:20:15] repeating so it was true that Eve was
[1:20:19] conceived by two beings
[1:20:26] so this last Exodus must vindicate must
[1:20:30] have all the Articles and the characters
[1:20:33] of what the First Act and that is why it
[1:20:36] is important for us to look at it now
[1:20:39] when this first Exodus people started
[1:20:41] journeying from Egypt they came to a
[1:20:45] place they've journeyed and had many
[1:20:48] victories they crossed the Red Sea they
[1:20:51] went through the Wilderness they enjoyed
[1:20:53] all the supernatural of God they even
[1:20:56] came to
[1:20:57] Jordan and the Waters of Jordan parted
[1:21:00] for them and they left a
[1:21:03] memorial but then they came to a place
[1:21:06] they called
[1:21:10] Jericho now this city of Jericho being a
[1:21:13] Gateway City always has his Gates
[1:21:20] opened but when The Exodus people were
[1:21:23] ready to pass
[1:21:25] the Bible said the gates of Jericho was
[1:21:29] deliberately
[1:21:34] shut are you following my
[1:21:37] story deliberately and intentionally
[1:21:41] shut because of the Exodus people now
[1:21:45] the prophet said the life of God is
[1:21:48] wrapped around
[1:21:49] Israel meaning that if you shut out
[1:21:52] Israel you have automatically shot out
[1:21:58] God and I'm beginning to look at the
[1:22:01] seven Church
[1:22:04] ages when you look at the Philadelphian
[1:22:06] Church
[1:22:07] age the Bible the prophet call it the
[1:22:11] age of the open
[1:22:13] door are you
[1:22:15] following meaning all the ages since the
[1:22:17] beginning of the work of reformation in
[1:22:20] Luther the Hedge was so opened for
[1:22:23] people to come in and and come out there
[1:22:26] was more inflow coming in but it will
[1:22:29] surprise you that an age after
[1:22:32] Philadelphian age the next one
[1:22:36] laia was an age that closed his
[1:22:41] gat all right we're
[1:22:45] coming Jericho Gates that have always
[1:22:48] been
[1:22:49] opened but because of the Exodus people
[1:22:52] read your Bible is there
[1:22:54] suddenly became
[1:22:58] short and the ages of the Gentile that
[1:23:01] was open so op until God called The
[1:23:06] Prophet called the age of Philadelphia
[1:23:08] the sixth age the age of the open door
[1:23:12] you will expect the opening to continue
[1:23:14] to the seventh but by the time it eats
[1:23:17] the seventh age it became
[1:23:20] shorts and not just shorts to everybody
[1:23:24] it was short to only one
[1:23:26] person because only one person had the
[1:23:29] testimony of behold I stand at the
[1:23:41] door who was that the Lord Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ laian shut his gate against Jesus
[1:23:50] just as Jericho shut its gate against
[1:23:53] the people of
[1:23:55] Jesus so figuratively they shot it
[1:23:59] against Jesus
[1:24:07] why and the leader of the Exodus went to
[1:24:11] make some
[1:24:12] appeasement to the king of Jericho said
[1:24:15] you don't need to shut your gate on hor
[1:24:18] open
[1:24:19] it we are gentle people we are
[1:24:22] Christians we don't take on due
[1:24:24] Advantage we just want to pass through
[1:24:26] your land we need this experience to
[1:24:30] enter into our
[1:24:33] land the king of Jericho might have said
[1:24:36] isn't there other places that you can
[1:24:38] pass why must you pass through my
[1:24:41] land and the Lord
[1:24:44] replied it is
[1:24:47] Jericho that I have ordained for my
[1:24:50] people to pass
[1:24:52] through I have no alternative
[1:24:58] God does not make provision for
[1:25:01] Alternatives because it must prove to
[1:25:04] you that I'm in charge of
[1:25:07] this it must prove to you that nobody
[1:25:10] can stop
[1:25:14] me I have no other alternative plan it
[1:25:18] is human beings that come with Plan B
[1:25:20] God doesn't have plan B he's always plan
[1:25:23] A and nothing
[1:25:28] more he said this is where I want to
[1:25:31] pass say you can't pass here we have
[1:25:35] shut our gate okay let's enter a deal if
[1:25:40] any of our cattles or our children
[1:25:42] became excited and they take anything
[1:25:44] off of your land we'll pay for it we
[1:25:47] don't need your money don't just pass
[1:25:50] such an hatred
[1:25:55] brother brah said they don't want a
[1:25:58] Revival simply because these folks do
[1:26:00] not belong to their
[1:26:04] group it's in the
[1:26:09] message it said they are so carried
[1:26:13] away with their denominational
[1:26:17] grouping let me tell you church let me
[1:26:20] tell you
[1:26:23] Church the reason some people in The
[1:26:26] Exodus were not able to go beyond the
[1:26:29] Wilderness was because when they
[1:26:32] physically came out of
[1:26:34] Egypt Egypt never came out of
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:43] them so there is always a physical Egypt
[1:26:46] to deal with and there's always a
[1:26:48] spiritual Egypt to deal with
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:54] I want you to know that Pagan room is
[1:26:57] not as powerful as Papa
[1:27:00] room you didn't catch
[1:27:04] that Pagan
[1:27:07] Rome is not as deadly is not as
[1:27:11] destructive as Papa
[1:27:14] Rome Pagan Rome is political Rome Italy
[1:27:18] when he was in charge under
[1:27:21] musolini taking control of the earth as
[1:27:24] one of the
[1:27:25] eims but is not as tough as the
[1:27:28] spiritual room who is taking charge of
[1:27:31] the
[1:27:32] earth through
[1:27:34] Vatican let's leave it as
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:38] that because if you read Revelations
[1:27:41] chapter
[1:27:42] 13 you will realize that this spiritual
[1:27:45] room is deadly and NOS nobody it does
[1:27:49] not even have regard for God
[1:27:56] so but it is important you are delivered
[1:27:58] of the physical Egypt and also the
[1:28:02] spiritual
[1:28:04] Egypt if you have come out of Egypt let
[1:28:07] Egypt come out of
[1:28:10] you it will be your total
[1:28:18] Deliverance you know the problem of the
[1:28:21] people in that
[1:28:22] Exodus when any challenge came across
[1:28:25] their P even though they have left Egypt
[1:28:28] for close to two years oh are there no
[1:28:31] graves in
[1:28:33] Egypt why have you brought us here to
[1:28:37] destroy
[1:28:38] us when they get hungry oh we remember
[1:28:41] the Cucumbers of Egypt we remember the
[1:28:44] gxs of
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:49] Egypt they came out of Egypt Egypt never
[1:28:53] came out of
[1:28:55] them that is halfway
[1:28:58] Deliverance you need total
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:03] Deliverance spiritual men will catch
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:09] it you love him
[1:29:11] tonight so this
[1:29:13] Jericho never wanted anything about the
[1:29:17] Exodus
[1:29:19] Revival they said they won't pass
[1:29:21] through here
[1:29:25] well if you know the credentials of the
[1:29:28] walls you will appreciate the confidence
[1:29:31] of these people to stop The Exodus
[1:29:35] children we are told that this wall on
[1:29:38] the surface is as
[1:29:40] wide as a six lane road because it could
[1:29:45] run six chariots apart without touching
[1:29:48] each other so in our modern day it will
[1:29:51] be like a sizling road so why
[1:29:55] with
[1:29:56] concrete and it forms a round circle or
[1:29:59] a four corner Circle all over the entire
[1:30:02] Jericho so these people have confidence
[1:30:04] in their
[1:30:14] worlds spiritual men it's unfolding to
[1:30:18] [Applause]
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:20] them you will soon realize that this is
[1:30:22] only ordinary p
[1:30:24] cing it does not have any
[1:30:31] substance they have strong
[1:30:35] confidence not only confidence
[1:30:38] arrogance
[1:30:40] Pride unusual
[1:30:42] boldness about this wall of Jericho
[1:30:45] brother brah called the wall of Jericho
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:52] denominationalism hey
[1:30:54] hey
[1:30:58] wait in the 50th year of Aza
[1:31:02] jubile listen to me very
[1:31:05] well it was supposed to be a
[1:31:09] celebration and they never got any
[1:31:12] better
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:22] person
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:52] e
[1:32:22] e
[1:32:52] e
[1:33:22] e e
[1:34:23] will have an another
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:26] Jubilee now Pentecostal Jubilee was a
[1:34:30] jubilee of
[1:34:36] Beth we need a jubilee of growth because
[1:34:41] after birth there must be growth in
[1:34:44] order to continue to sustain the joy of
[1:34:47] birth in 1963 presented us with another
[1:34:52] Jubilee which was a jubilee of growth 50
[1:34:56] years when the full word of God was born
[1:35:00] into
[1:35:02] manifestation and it came with another
[1:35:08] indictment what God called us out
[1:35:11] of we have found ourself in it but the
[1:35:15] prophet left us with the promise he said
[1:35:18] in the Year of
[1:35:20] Jubilee the old Fighters must
[1:35:24] giveway in order for the children of
[1:35:27] Jubilee to receive their
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:33] freedom so Jericho wall was so
[1:35:36] thick and these people had
[1:35:39] confidence even Joshua had no idea of
[1:35:44] how they will ever enter through that
[1:35:47] wall and pass by the Bible said it was
[1:35:50] so short and the people who shot it were
[1:35:53] not even ready to have a
[1:36:00] conversation but do you know what
[1:36:03] happened in order to pull down this wall
[1:36:07] there must be an
[1:36:11] appearance because only God has the
[1:36:15] formula to pull down the
[1:36:19] wall God allowed this church to pass
[1:36:22] through Jordan
[1:36:23] and after Jordan he called for a fresh
[1:36:28] circumcision and The Exodus judge was
[1:36:31] obeying the Bible said the second
[1:36:34] circumcision became necessary because
[1:36:36] all the old
[1:36:38] Generations who rebelled against
[1:36:42] God have died
[1:36:45] out the new ones that were born in the
[1:36:47] wilderness needs to be
[1:36:50] circumcised in order for them to be
[1:36:52] prepared to receive the visitation of
[1:36:55] the almighty
[1:36:57] God after this
[1:37:00] circumcision Then There came an
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:07] appearance
[1:37:09] suddenly Joshua was standing I think
[1:37:12] Pastor Ray touched it somewhere or was
[1:37:15] it brother Isaac Joshua was standing and
[1:37:18] all of a sudden the angel of the Lord
[1:37:22] came down
[1:37:26] and when it came down Joshua Drew out
[1:37:28] his
[1:37:29] sword are you for hor or you against us
[1:37:33] even God who knew that he is bound by
[1:37:35] his word quickly introduced
[1:37:50] himself there's a reason why he did that
[1:37:53] because he has promised Joshua
[1:37:55] beforehand no man will be able to stand
[1:37:58] against
[1:38:07] you and this Joshua this Joshua believed
[1:38:12] everything God told
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:18] him you think God does not believe his
[1:38:21] own word he beli his own
[1:38:24] in the message perfect faith when God
[1:38:27] came in flesh the prophet said for God
[1:38:30] himself in flesh to be able to do what
[1:38:33] his own word said he has to read it and
[1:38:37] believe what he said concerning his own
[1:38:47] self so it would have been very
[1:38:49] dangerous for him not to introduce
[1:38:52] himself fast
[1:38:56] and when he
[1:38:58] did Joshua said ah ah so it is our Lord
[1:39:03] up
[1:39:07] here then he told him put up thy
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:13] shoes and as Joshua hallowed the
[1:39:16] presence of God why did God came down he
[1:39:20] came down for only one mission to give
[1:39:23] the mystery or the revelation of how to
[1:39:26] pull down the wall of
[1:39:29] Jericho read your Bible is
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:35] there and he told him this is not a job
[1:39:38] for
[1:39:39] bulldozers this is not a caterpillar job
[1:39:43] this is not Earth moving equipment job
[1:39:46] but I'm going to give you the
[1:39:47] prescription you follow it and all will
[1:39:50] be well
[1:39:54] this message of the how is our
[1:39:58] Everlasting
[1:40:00] prescription and is good for everything
[1:40:03] is good for anything follow it and all
[1:40:07] will be
[1:40:18] well God has to come down
[1:40:25] have we traveled very far we've traveled
[1:40:28] very far listen to this let's begin to
[1:40:32] draw the
[1:40:34] parallel laian H shut his gate don't
[1:40:38] forget that Revelations 3 verse 14- 21
[1:40:42] told us that the gate was shut the one
[1:40:46] who was supposed to be inside was
[1:40:50] outside if you keep Jesus outside you
[1:40:53] have kept life
[1:40:55] outside so inside will be what
[1:40:59] Darkness if you keep Jesus outside you
[1:41:03] have kept light outside inside will be
[1:41:06] what darkness and death that is why
[1:41:10] laian condition became so bad for you to
[1:41:14] stay
[1:41:15] inside because they kept Jesus outside
[1:41:19] by keeping Jesus outside they became
[1:41:21] miserable riched
[1:41:24] poor
[1:41:26] blind and on top of it they knowe it it
[1:41:30] not spiritual
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:35] Amnesia you cannot live inside
[1:41:38] that but they don't want you to go
[1:41:42] out in the message Feast of a trumpet
[1:41:45] the prophet said for 2,000 years the
[1:41:48] denominational WS have blocked the
[1:41:51] movement of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:53] [Music]
[1:41:55] Spirit but something has got to be done
[1:41:59] you cannot prevent Jesus because he's
[1:42:02] got people within that wall to be
[1:42:07] delivered and he has to pass through it
[1:42:10] in order to bring out his
[1:42:13] own you say Jesus pass another way he
[1:42:16] said no I have no alternative I must go
[1:42:20] through here
[1:42:26] he said behold I stand at the
[1:42:30] door listen to what he says if any man
[1:42:34] open to
[1:42:35] me in other words laian will never be
[1:42:38] saved as a
[1:42:42] group there will be no Collective
[1:42:45] salvation for loud
[1:42:48] here when I say laia that is Pentecostal
[1:42:52] loud this year because we traveled from
[1:42:55] justification of Luther and came into
[1:42:59] the sanctification of Wesley and came
[1:43:01] into the new birth of Pentecostals or
[1:43:04] Pentecost but birth is not the end of
[1:43:08] life is the beginning of manifested Life
[1:43:13] this little brother here was born one
[1:43:16] day but inside him as he is here now is
[1:43:20] the potential to be a father
[1:43:23] hey wait a minute to be an adult to be a
[1:43:27] husband to be a father a grandfather
[1:43:31] even a great
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:36] grandfather but all this potential in
[1:43:39] order to be revealed needs just two
[1:43:44] things the right atmosphere and balanced
[1:43:49] diet as you give him the correct food
[1:43:53] and you keep him in the right
[1:43:55] environment leave the rest one of these
[1:43:59] days he will send you his invitation
[1:44:01] card you will come to his wedding one of
[1:44:04] these
[1:44:08] days because it was already in
[1:44:11] him and it's in you brother Braham said
[1:44:15] when you receive the new birth you have
[1:44:18] adoption in
[1:44:20] potentiality right there
[1:44:25] Lord hallu what you need is correct diet
[1:44:30] pure spiritual food in Du
[1:44:34] season some of us know the destination
[1:44:37] but the challenge is how to get there if
[1:44:40] you don't know how to get there you will
[1:44:42] keep jumping you will keep excited you
[1:44:45] won't get there at the end of the day
[1:44:47] you feel frustrated you will say let us
[1:44:50] assume I am there assumption doesn't
[1:44:52] take take you there you must go through
[1:44:55] the
[1:44:57] road the road is a revelation of the
[1:45:00] [Applause]
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:09] word why will God insist on
[1:45:13] Jericho because Rahab was
[1:45:19] there hey hey hey hey
[1:45:23] hey hey I'm striking a shadow
[1:45:30] tonight
[1:45:35] RAB you will realize that RAB was a type
[1:45:38] of the
[1:45:39] Bride because it was the generation of
[1:45:42] Rahab that produced Christ in
[1:45:45] flesh and it is this R
[1:45:48] generation that is going to bring forth
[1:45:50] Christ for this hour
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:45:56] RAB was there so it is of
[1:46:00] necessity that God must pass through it
[1:46:04] he doesn't have business in Jericho he's
[1:46:06] not going to live there but his God is
[1:46:09] one in there God is not going to live in
[1:46:12] laia that is blind wretched miserable
[1:46:15] that's a poor condition but he's got
[1:46:18] people in there that he must bring out
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:28] and do you know how God brought out
[1:46:31] RAB he sent after God gave Joshua the
[1:46:36] formula it looks so
[1:46:39] silent amen it looks like nothing has
[1:46:42] happened we only heard of the appearance
[1:46:45] of the Angel and it said this he said
[1:46:47] that but you see it was after he left
[1:46:50] that Joshua began to pray
[1:46:54] what the angel
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:59] brought what a silent hour what a silent
[1:47:07] gospel and after we have run through the
[1:47:09] Journey of
[1:47:12] justification we came into
[1:47:14] sanctification we came into the
[1:47:16] Pentecost New Birth friends we needed
[1:47:19] something more if we're going to meet
[1:47:22] the condition of this hour because
[1:47:26] Pentecostal cannot meet the condition of
[1:47:30] this
[1:47:34] hour we needed something more even these
[1:47:37] that we needed the prophets did not
[1:47:46] know what God has given him this far is
[1:47:49] to be able to explain things that are
[1:47:51] written around the media
[1:47:54] structure it couldn't explain what was
[1:47:57] inside and it will take what was inside
[1:48:01] to start rapturing
[1:48:03] faith in you and her it will take what
[1:48:06] was inside to give us a lift that we
[1:48:10] needed to fly out it will take what was
[1:48:13] inside to bring to us the realization
[1:48:16] that we are not denominational Bard
[1:48:19] chickens
[1:48:27] because up to that
[1:48:30] time from Luther to Wesley to
[1:48:35] pentecostales year the identity of the
[1:48:37] Bride wasn't
[1:48:40] clear it was all
[1:48:43] congregation
[1:48:45] ah
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:50] oh everybody looks the same everybody
[1:48:53] feels the same but we needed
[1:48:56] something to separate possessors from
[1:49:00] professors I'm using the language of the
[1:49:03] Prophet brother brah said Ramses and the
[1:49:06] Moses they were raised in the same
[1:49:09] Palace and they dwelt together for too
[1:49:12] long but the hour must come that they
[1:49:15] must go their different
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:19] way deceit cannot be air with the shock
[1:49:24] it was good a shock has carried it thus
[1:49:26] far but this shock must give away so
[1:49:30] that we can harvest the
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:33] seed it will take something more than
[1:49:37] Pentecostal
[1:49:44] Revival brother Brown said their
[1:49:46] Crossing of Jordan was a type of their
[1:49:49] new birth that passed them from death
[1:49:51] into life
[1:49:53] but after Jordan Jericho was
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:00] waiting and this Jericho stood
[1:50:03] solid to challenge The Exodus
[1:50:09] people this is why the angel had to come
[1:50:13] down and in order for us to be able to
[1:50:18] pull down the walls of laia and get the
[1:50:21] RAB house
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:25] the has to come down
[1:50:29] again and seven angels came
[1:50:32] down that was why when the prophet used
[1:50:36] the Crowbar to knock off the head of the
[1:50:38] stone and when that precious stone
[1:50:41] became appeared so innocent the prophet
[1:50:45] said it is the truth in the Bible upon
[1:50:48] which nobody has attempted
[1:50:50] interpretation but you watch brother
[1:50:52] brah couldn't talk about
[1:50:55] it like he talked about the things
[1:50:58] around when we are tying the loose
[1:51:03] hands this time around he needed more
[1:51:06] than the grace of a lan
[1:51:13] messenger he needed a Grace more than
[1:51:17] that of a seventh angel
[1:51:19] messenger of laia
[1:51:23] because even as a seventh angel
[1:51:25] messenger brother Braham said there are
[1:51:27] so many things we have guessed at at the
[1:51:30] denominational ages of the church
[1:51:34] Hallelujah but now we needed something
[1:51:37] that will take care of all the guest
[1:51:39] work and bring the Perfection with
[1:51:42] perfect
[1:51:45] interpretation to clear every
[1:51:49] ignorance because for 2,000 years yes
[1:51:53] Jesus has been interceding for our
[1:51:56] ignorance but the days of ignorance
[1:51:58] intercession will soon be over because
[1:52:01] the full word of God is going to be born
[1:52:04] into
[1:52:05] manifestation this is why after the full
[1:52:08] word of God was born brother Braham said
[1:52:11] the scripture has been perfectly
[1:52:13] interpreted and it canot be thoroughly
[1:52:16] and perfectly understood
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:23] we needed something more than what we
[1:52:26] have heard this is the reason instead of
[1:52:28] the Prophet waiting to explain it he
[1:52:31] withdrew himself he was in the East he
[1:52:34] started going
[1:52:36] west to do what to have an Angelic
[1:52:40] encounter that will reveal Jesus again
[1:52:43] in form of the
[1:52:45] cloud God bless Pastor H for the cloud
[1:52:48] message
[1:52:53] you see the reason why the devil is
[1:52:55] fighting the
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] cloud let me tell you without that ring
[1:53:01] of mystery you are not better than a
[1:53:04] Pentecostal
[1:53:06] believer I'm telling you the devil knew
[1:53:10] what that holds for you this is why he's
[1:53:12] fighting it it's a smoke of an aeroplane
[1:53:15] that's
[1:53:19] blasphemy the prophet said it wasn't a
[1:53:22] smoke of an
[1:53:23] herlan seven angels actually came
[1:53:27] down before Witnesses Fred stman was
[1:53:31] there Goman was there they took cover
[1:53:35] they knew something happened because God
[1:53:38] came
[1:53:39] down what did they come down to
[1:53:43] do hey hey
[1:53:47] hey the you see the devil doesn't like
[1:53:49] this
[1:53:51] now but he came stop it what did they
[1:53:54] come down to do to give brother Braham
[1:53:57] another
[1:53:59] commission the commission the revelation
[1:54:03] of what it takes to bring
[1:54:07] RAB out of
[1:54:11] [Applause]
[1:54:15] laia because you need beyond the first
[1:54:18] pole you need beyond the second pole
[1:54:21] they were good
[1:54:23] but they attracted all kinds from among
[1:54:26] these all kinds we need the T to saive
[1:54:30] out the bride out of all
[1:54:36] kinds and this was what they went w for
[1:54:39] and when he was coming back he never
[1:54:42] knew they took the picture he left
[1:54:44] straight for
[1:54:46] somewhere to appear in a court and make
[1:54:49] intercession for a boy who was on the
[1:54:51] death parrow and when he came back one
[1:54:54] of the officers in the church showed him
[1:54:56] the picture
[1:54:58] amen and uh the picture attracted him so
[1:55:01] well because he could relate his
[1:55:04] experience with it now what this
[1:55:06] Brethren don't realize attacking it was
[1:55:09] that 6 months to one year before brother
[1:55:13] Braham has prophesied it says is this
[1:55:15] the time and he explained the mechanism
[1:55:19] of how it will happen because he saw it
[1:55:22] as a vision and do see the Lord can
[1:55:26] never
[1:55:29] [Applause]
[1:55:31] fail then the prophet took the picture
[1:55:34] and kept it for a while but the first
[1:55:36] time he spoke about it he said this
[1:55:39] picture I never realized it was taken
[1:55:43] but it could have been taken two days
[1:55:46] before or two days
[1:55:49] after I was there if it was two days
[1:55:52] before it was the angels of God lowering
[1:55:56] down to give me my
[1:55:59] commission if it was two days after it
[1:56:02] was the angels of God going back after
[1:56:05] the commission that was his first public
[1:56:08] statement on the Ring of mystery then he
[1:56:12] began to explain that this took place he
[1:56:15] said when this Angels Came Down they
[1:56:18] swept me up in the Pyramid of themselves
[1:56:21] he said because the truth of the seal
[1:56:24] and the Thunders l in their
[1:56:31] midst and after they brought him back
[1:56:34] they told him you are in West go back
[1:56:36] East which is jille and for the next
[1:56:40] seven nights you are going to preach the
[1:56:44] SS so they gave him the formula and he
[1:56:48] preached that in his
[1:56:49] church Joshua preached it in in his
[1:56:53] church and after the summon wait for it
[1:56:56] the tape
[1:56:59] boys who had recorded the message
[1:57:02] brother Braham said it was the two tape
[1:57:05] boys Hallelujah spies who went into
[1:57:10] Jericho under cover and when they were
[1:57:13] going the Lord was guiding their parts
[1:57:17] to the house of the

[2:02:29] Ghost Church of the Living
[2:02:32] God don't forget her name was RAB
[2:02:38] the but when RAB the
[2:02:41] hot heard the message of the
[2:02:45] hour something in
[2:02:48] her hallelujah hallelujah the real heart
[2:02:52] because brother Braham said that Gene of
[2:02:55] God in you was meant to be your real
[2:03:00] you uh-huh this is the reason all that
[2:03:05] you did before the quickening of the
[2:03:08] Gin people say I have passed me I don't
[2:03:11] have
[2:03:15] passed listen to me very
[2:03:17] well me I do not have a past
[2:03:23] because what was to be real me never
[2:03:26] ever
[2:03:27] sinned and will never ever
[2:03:35] sin we must let the church know the
[2:03:38] meaning of true
[2:03:40] justification what SED was your hold
[2:03:43] you what did wrong was your old you your
[2:03:47] real you never one day
[2:03:53] [Applause]
[2:03:55] wait wait wait do you know why Esau was
[2:03:58] confused when he saw
[2:04:01] Jacob you don't know God bless you it
[2:04:04] was because he was looking for
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:14] Jacob it was Jacob he had problem
[2:04:17] with it was Jacob he believed stole his
[2:04:21] better right it was Jacob he
[2:04:25] believed tricked
[2:04:27] him but it wasn't Israel
[2:04:31] unfortunately for Esau before Jacob got
[2:04:35] to Esau he had gone into conference with
[2:04:39] God for his real him to be
[2:04:44] activated so by the time he appeared
[2:04:47] before Esau it wasn't Jacob it was
[2:04:51] Israel you cannot hold Israel
[2:04:54] responsible for what Jacob
[2:04:57] did is not possible
[2:05:26] listen to me Church of the Living
[2:05:31] God is it fair is it fair to hold Israel
[2:05:37] responsible for what Jacob
[2:05:39] [Applause]
[2:05:41] did wait
[2:05:43] wait then if it is not
[2:05:46] fear does isau have a right to tell
[2:05:50] Israel I forgive you
[2:05:56] he has a right to ask him by forgive me
[2:05:58] for
[2:06:01] what I never did it to begin
[2:06:06] with what are you forgiving me
[2:06:10] for am I am I Jacob even is will say no

[2:06:19] go into my inheritance
[2:06:22] Church of the Living God you need to
[2:06:24] understand this otherwise you will never
[2:06:27] be a
[2:06:28] Christian Israel had no past it was
[2:06:37] Jacob when the Bible said
[2:06:40] listen when the Bible said Abraham
[2:06:43] believed God and it was imputed to him
[2:06:47] for righteousness then he came back and
[2:06:50] robbed it in very well he said Abraham
[2:06:53] St
[2:06:57] not now you and I will
[2:07:00] say I can show you in the Bible where he
[2:07:03] left to the face of God and say let
[2:07:07] ishma live before you you can't show me
[2:07:10] any
[2:07:12] longer because what you will show me is
[2:07:15] not Abraham what you will show me is
[2:07:17] Abraham
[2:07:27] you are no more
[2:07:29] habram you are no more Jacob you are
[2:07:33] Israel you are Abraham who shall lay
[2:07:37] anything for the chge of God's elect it
[2:07:40] is God that
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:48] justify H Hall
[2:08:02] Abraham was to be your real
[2:08:05] you and let me tell you as far as God is
[2:08:09] concerned there was never a time he
[2:08:11] reckoned with
[2:08:13] Abraham that is why everything Abraham
[2:08:16] did when God invoked the Covenant he
[2:08:20] didn't see it
[2:08:22] Abraham brought forth
[2:08:24] ishmail but God came and said Abraham
[2:08:27] take thy son thine only
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:36] son thine
[2:08:42] only then you will go you will go back
[2:08:44] to the Bible you go back to the Bible
[2:08:47] you
[2:08:48] say God did you forget they said by your
[2:08:52] nature you cannot
[2:08:53] forget this ishmail is old enough is too
[2:08:57] conspicuous to be forgotten that is
[2:09:00] existing it's 25 years old at the time
[2:09:04] we are talking about how can you say
[2:09:07] Isaac is the only son of Abraham God
[2:09:10] will say how can I not say that what is
[2:09:13] the son name of ishmail Abraham what is
[2:09:16] the s name of Isaac Abraham
[2:09:24] that is your true
[2:09:36] justification brother Braham said your
[2:09:39] hold record your hold book in The Book
[2:09:43] of Life not in the lamp section of the
[2:09:47] book of life that old book God took it
[2:09:50] off rap it and throw it
[2:09:54] far into the sea of his
[2:09:58] forgetfulness never ever to be
[2:10:02] remembered it does not even
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:06] exist and you will be here and allow the
[2:10:09] devil to say it's is bringing my which P
[2:10:13] it's because you have not accepted your
[2:10:15] justification
[2:10:17] [Applause]
[2:10:29] oh accept it
[2:10:30] [Applause]
[2:10:33] tonight you love
[2:10:37] him so as far as God is concerned you
[2:10:41] can keep dwelling on RAB the
[2:10:44] harot God didn't even know RAB theot
[2:10:49] existed because this same one you called
[2:10:52] R of the
[2:10:53] hot when she heard the message that
[2:10:56] quickens that gy she hungered for the
[2:11:00] new birth she hungered for the token did
[2:11:04] she receive it
[2:11:07] [Applause]
[2:11:12] yes and the moment she receiv received
[2:11:15] the talken see the
[2:11:17] Bible the value of our life Rose High
[2:11:22] amen do you know what the tape boy said
[2:11:26] Believers predestinated seed manifested
[2:11:30] believers who came to play the T they
[2:11:32] said if anything happened to you by this
[2:11:37] token the life of the two of us will go
[2:11:41] for one life of yours by the token the
[2:11:44] value of our life was raised to equal
[2:11:47] the lives of two tape boys
[2:11:50] [Applause]
[2:11:57] when you receive the token it raises
[2:11:59] your life
[2:12:00] value I'd rather be an alltime Christian
[2:12:04] than anything I
[2:12:09] know but church let me say this when
[2:12:12] this taken takes are hold like it did
[2:12:15] for Jacob like it did for
[2:12:18] Abraham it changed things
[2:12:25] completely you cannot relate their new
[2:12:29] life with what you called the whole life
[2:12:33] there was a complete
[2:12:37] change so this blessing will never make
[2:12:40] you a religious
[2:12:42] sinner
[2:12:44] uhhuh I've been Justified and you are
[2:12:47] still living wrong you never know it it
[2:12:50] is the work of God and it does
[2:12:54] [Applause]
[2:12:58] happen but I'm wetting your appetite
[2:13:01] even if you are down this evening don't
[2:13:03] stay down because there's provision for
[2:13:07] you if RAB was as filthy as she
[2:13:12] was and Mery could Rite
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:18] aive there is no life that is hopeless
[2:13:21] is here
[2:13:22] tonight no matter how low down you
[2:13:25] are there is power in the cleansing
[2:13:28] blood of Jesus
[2:13:30] [Applause]
[2:13:33] Christ look at that woman at the
[2:13:36] well she was so Lo she couldn't come out
[2:13:39] when others
[2:13:41] come but the Bible told me something
[2:13:44] Jesus was to pass
[2:13:46] away it was an
[2:13:48] appointment because even though she
[2:13:50] looks so dark
[2:13:52] outside but there was light to be
[2:13:55] quickened from
[2:13:57] within I believe there is the light of
[2:13:59] God in your heart I believe the gene of
[2:14:02] God is there otherwise you wouldn't be
[2:14:05] here you wouldn't love things like
[2:14:09] this let go and let go this
[2:14:14] evening and when she was presented with
[2:14:17] the
[2:14:18] message of that hour
[2:14:21] their requests have always been
[2:14:23] similar RAB asked for the token the
[2:14:26] woman at the well asks for the water of
[2:14:29] life it is the same
[2:14:31] thing and the moment she received it the
[2:14:35] Bible says she let down a picture and
[2:14:38] all she goes into the Town come see a
[2:14:40] man who told me all I ever did she never
[2:14:44] returns to that old life again because
[2:14:47] the change took place
[2:14:53] the prophet said God never told her
[2:14:55] everything she did but she believed that
[2:14:58] if she could if he could tell that much
[2:15:01] he could tell
[2:15:06] all blessed are those who hunger and
[2:15:10] task for righteousness they shall be
[2:15:14] filled you love him
[2:15:17] tonight but this sister was
[2:15:19] matched when they gave her the token she
[2:15:23] didn't keep quiet so okay my own case is
[2:15:27] settled how about my
[2:15:30] father the T boy said bring them in how
[2:15:34] about my mother bring them in how about
[2:15:37] my brothers bring them in my sisters in
[2:15:41] fact bring as many as you can bring in
[2:15:45] under the
[2:15:47] token that is a sound believer
[2:15:52] you know you and I have a promise I
[2:15:55] don't know how you feel about it but
[2:15:57] it's all real to
[2:15:59] me the Philippian
[2:16:01] Jailer when he saw the miracle of God he
[2:16:05] was too embarrassed he wanted to kill
[2:16:09] himself Paul and Silas or whoever say
[2:16:13] don't kill yourself we are here we are
[2:16:17] Christians we don't take on due
[2:16:19] advantage
[2:16:21] we are here he when he saw that with
[2:16:24] that one sermon he saw a
[2:16:28] life that played out like
[2:16:31] that he preached so much to these men
[2:16:34] until he said s what can I do to be
[2:16:37] saved they said for you to be saved let
[2:16:41] us show to you that it is not only you
[2:16:43] that God is interested
[2:16:45] in he said believe on the Lord and thou
[2:16:50] and
[2:16:55] I can show you from Genesis coming to
[2:16:59] Revelation to show to you that God's
[2:17:02] Plan of Salvation has always been for
[2:17:05] you and your
[2:17:09] family and he has never changed that
[2:17:12] [Applause]
[2:17:14] idea the Bible said one of the only
[2:17:17] reasons why God love to expose himself
[2:17:21] revealed things to Abraham is because he
[2:17:24] knew that Abraham will do what
[2:17:28] teach mothers are you here you've given
[2:17:32] the teaching to Sunday school teacher no
[2:17:35] sir you've given the teaching to the
[2:17:37] school teachers no sir it is your job to
[2:17:41] bring up those
[2:17:44] children if if the gospel of Matthew
[2:17:47] Mark Luke and John is going to be
[2:17:50] successful in their life they need to
[2:17:52] take the Fifth Gospel first you know
[2:17:55] God's mathematics is very tricky it
[2:17:58] doesn't run 1 2 3 4 5 mother is the
[2:18:01] Fifth Gospel but it is the First Gospel
[2:18:04] a child needs in order to make the four
[2:18:07] gospels
[2:18:08] meaningful and brother Brown said you
[2:18:11] can do more on your knees for those
[2:18:14] children that preachers can do behind
[2:18:17] the pit
[2:18:24] but you know what you cannot give what
[2:18:26] you don't have it must be in you to give
[2:18:30] it to the
[2:18:31] [Applause]
[2:18:35] children but let me say tonight that God
[2:18:39] will judge your influence upon those
[2:18:42] children the reason the daughters in
[2:18:45] America became strict tees was because
[2:18:48] their mothers were street workers
[2:18:51] the prophet said so so it's a
[2:18:53] generational Heritage what are you
[2:18:56] passing on to those children think about
[2:18:58] that this evening because it is God's
[2:19:01] program to save you and your family when
[2:19:05] we come to the middle of the Bible
[2:19:07] Isaiah told us that the Heavenly
[2:19:10] Jerusalem the new Earth and the new
[2:19:12] heaven Isaiah 65 that God is preparing
[2:19:15] for you and I he said so that you and
[2:19:18] your Offspring will be there
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:24] God did not design Heaven only for you
[2:19:27] he designed it also for your children
[2:19:30] but as in every
[2:19:32] age and every Exodus Satan will look for
[2:19:36] a
[2:19:37] deal why was Pharaoh interested in the
[2:19:40] little
[2:19:42] children when he came under the heavy
[2:19:44] pounding of the plague he said you had
[2:19:46] us we even give you everything you need
[2:19:48] for service you go and serve the Lord
[2:19:50] the children did he not say so he said
[2:19:54] so because he knew that the continuity
[2:19:57] of that Revival depends on the
[2:19:59] continuity
[2:20:01] of so he wants to kill the Revival by
[2:20:05] destroying the little
[2:20:12] children but you got four things to do
[2:20:14] Church mothers and fathers are you here
[2:20:18] you've got four things to do the prophet
[2:20:21] said you must believe that if it works
[2:20:23] for you it's going to work for
[2:20:26] them to do that you don't look at
[2:20:29] symptoms their condition may not make
[2:20:32] them look like proper children but don't
[2:20:34] ever call your child a serpent
[2:20:36] [Applause]
[2:20:42] seed if the lord gave those children to
[2:20:45] you he never gave them to be an
[2:20:47] Affliction in your
[2:20:49] life the Devil May interfere but you've
[2:20:52] got to buckle up on your knees and win
[2:20:56] them back for the Lord Jesus Christ he
[2:20:59] said the first thing is believe that if
[2:21:01] it works for you it will work for them
[2:21:05] then number two live a life worthy
[2:21:08] before them number three spend time to
[2:21:11] share the word and to pray with them
[2:21:15] number four read your house of every
[2:21:17] wrong
[2:21:19] atmosphere create the right environment
[2:21:22] things that shouldn't be in your house
[2:21:24] throw them
[2:21:25] out all those dirty games and nonsense
[2:21:28] throw it out the door if anybody ask you
[2:21:31] what are you doing we are doing house
[2:21:33] cleaning environmental sanitation we
[2:21:36] want a place clean all the dirty dresses
[2:21:41] all the dirty magazines throw them out
[2:21:48] [Applause]
[2:21:51] when you do that brother Braham said
[2:21:53] leave the rest to
[2:21:55] God you hold on for them leave the rest
[2:21:59] to God they will come
[2:22:03] in Rab was too smart a
[2:22:06] Believer she brought a family under the
[2:22:10] token and when the T boy finished that
[2:22:13] business that's all they came for in
[2:22:15] Jericho they
[2:22:18] left and the next thing the the church
[2:22:21] kept
[2:22:22] advancing this laia is going to be
[2:22:25] judged after the Lord takes out every
[2:22:30] re this is why this is the time of
[2:22:33] coming out and going in we're going into
[2:22:37] something else I don't live in laia any
[2:22:40] longer that's why the Deeds of laia
[2:22:42] don't bother me because my master stood
[2:22:46] outside my husband stood outside he said
[2:22:50] be old I stand at the door and I'm
[2:22:54] knocking now watch what he said in this
[2:22:56] knocking he wasn't interested in Saving
[2:23:00] in getting everybody it is in the
[2:23:04] whosoever that whosoever has got to be
[2:23:09] predestinated how did laia get into that
[2:23:16] condition it was this same La this year
[2:23:18] follow with me now as we close
[2:23:21] this same laia in
[2:23:23] 1962 was crying for
[2:23:26] Revival if you are familiar with the
[2:23:28] message this will be nice for
[2:23:30] you they were crying for Revival brother
[2:23:34] Braham said there is no time they will
[2:23:35] print a a magazine that it will not be
[2:23:38] oh we need Revival it is not too late
[2:23:41] yet there will be a Breaking of the day
[2:23:43] we love the Lord Herod of Hope
[2:23:47] Revival then the prophet came to the
[2:23:49] church in early 63 he said this cry for
[2:23:53] revival can only be
[2:23:56] satisfied with the unveiling of the
[2:23:59] seven
[2:24:00] tunders he said
[2:24:05] so come in quiet home isn't
[2:24:10] it then shortly after he started opening
[2:24:15] the
[2:24:15] seals one seal one night one seal one
[2:24:21] night then on the seventh night or the
[2:24:25] eighth night because it jumped or the
[2:24:28] ninth night then it became the seventh
[2:24:33] seal which never became just one
[2:24:36] straight jacket
[2:24:37] thing the first seal was the first o
[2:24:41] Rider second
[2:24:43] seal red horse rider T
[2:24:47] seal uh black horse rider the fourth
[2:24:51] seal pale o rather fifth seal Souls
[2:24:53] under the altar Sixth Seal judgment seal
[2:24:57] seventh seal
[2:25:01] silence and the prophet
[2:25:03] said what is in this with nobody knows
[2:25:08] but we need to
[2:25:14] know then they began to tell the church
[2:25:17] they've unfolded into three but I will
[2:25:20] speak of one of
[2:25:23] them and that fold that I'm going to
[2:25:25] speak on is the seven
[2:25:28] [Applause]
[2:25:31] Thunders then he began to
[2:25:35] say it's are these seven tunders are the
[2:25:38] Revelation
[2:25:41] contained in the seven
[2:25:46] [Applause]
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:49] seal and said you and I need it I told
[2:25:52] you we know the destination but we need
[2:25:55] to know how to get there the destination
[2:25:58] is full stature it's an adoptable child
[2:26:02] but how will this child become adopted
[2:26:05] he needs to Fellowship he needs to eat
[2:26:08] the open book The revelation of the
[2:26:12] tenders he need to eat it when he eat it
[2:26:16] he will work upon the atoms of his body
[2:26:19] and change him from Glory to
[2:26:21] Glory till he come to full
[2:26:26] sture he needs to hit it you need to hit
[2:26:30] it because that is what the open book is
[2:26:33] all
[2:26:35] about Hallelujah and brother Braham said
[2:26:38] and we yet a humble little group
[2:26:42] Hallelujah he went back to that cloud
[2:26:46] again Hallelujah and he began to talk
[2:26:49] about it he said these Heaven Angels
[2:26:51] came down and unfolded the entire
[2:26:55] mystery of the Bible to us and we yet a
[2:26:59] humble little group we are here enjoying
[2:27:02] the entire opening of the word we know
[2:27:06] the truth about marriage today we know
[2:27:08] the truth about divers about serpent
[2:27:10] seed about godhe about many other things
[2:27:14] he said this were the revelations that
[2:27:16] the word brought To Us by the opening of
[2:27:19] the seals
[2:27:21] [Applause]
[2:27:22] you will say we know some of them before
[2:27:24] the opening of the seals your faith your
[2:27:27] Revelation wasn't
[2:27:29] perfected until the opening of the seals
[2:27:33] it perfected what you knew and it opened
[2:27:35] what you never
[2:27:37] know it is these entire things you need
[2:27:40] to eat like this little baby in order to
[2:27:43] come to full statue so this is the
[2:27:46] destination this will take you to the
[2:27:48] destination that why brother Braham said
[2:27:51] the messenger of this age will do two
[2:27:54] things do you believe that he said one
[2:27:57] according to Malachi
[2:27:59] 4: 5 and 6 it will turn the heart of the
[2:28:03] children back to the fathers do we
[2:28:06] believe that will it take us to a
[2:28:08] laboratory to do that will it take us to
[2:28:11] the sergeon table to do that wait for it
[2:28:14] then it said according to Revelation
[2:28:17] 10:7 he will reveal the Mysteries of the
[2:28:20] seven Thunders did he say so so seven
[2:28:24] Thunders are some contents to bring us
[2:28:27] to full stature when we know them and
[2:28:29] eat them we are automatically growing
[2:28:32] the adding the prophet talk about is not
[2:28:35] the adding of subtraction of of
[2:28:38] mathematics you must understand that
[2:28:40] come my little
[2:28:42] brother brother Isaac declar the state
[2:28:44] of emergency yesterday so I will go
[2:28:47] beyond protocols to liberate the people
[2:28:49] of God
[2:28:50] bring him
[2:28:52] up under state of emergency you don't
[2:28:55] work by any Constitution so forgive me
[2:28:58] brother if I'm getting out of protocol
[2:29:00] the Church of God I'm running late sorry
[2:29:03] I will close now the Church of God must
[2:29:06] know this how do we hurt to the hand of
[2:29:08] this
[2:29:11] boy explain it to
[2:29:13] me but would this hand be headed to
[2:29:17] would this leg be headed to is he going
[2:29:19] to remain like this permanently he's
[2:29:22] going to grow like yours how did we
[2:29:26] Hur all the things to be added was
[2:29:29] inside the day he was born what you give
[2:29:32] him to do the addition was the food as
[2:29:35] you feed him you keep him in the right
[2:29:37] atmosphere the addition takes place you
[2:29:40] see him one day you say you are now a
[2:29:42] teenager you see him another day you are
[2:29:44] past a teenager you see him another day
[2:29:47] you are now an adult you see him another
[2:29:49] day you you are now a full grown man
[2:29:51] even if he's not doing anything about
[2:29:53] marriage you are asking him what are you
[2:29:55] doing because he has added enough to get
[2:30:05] marriage watch upon
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:09] watch brings a man to full
[2:30:13] sture this is the way it is friends and
[2:30:16] that is what you and I needed re up
[2:30:20] requested for that and she got it and we
[2:30:24] requested for that and by the grace of
[2:30:26] God we are getting it you know why the
[2:30:29] Reason God abandoned loud this year was
[2:30:32] because just as Jericho
[2:30:36] testified laia please give me just 10
[2:30:39] minutes is that okay is that okay just
[2:30:43] as just as Jericho testified we have Ed
[2:30:48] laia also
[2:30:51] testify see their testimony one day they
[2:30:54] invited brother Brown when you go home
[2:30:57] read the message in indictment they
[2:30:59] invited the prophets under cover that we
[2:31:02] want to Fellowship but the Lord knew
[2:31:05] they wanted to challenge him so the
[2:31:07] moment they mentioned the prophet the
[2:31:09] god of the Prophet attended the
[2:31:11] meeting and he listened to all their
[2:31:13] conversation before they brought their
[2:31:16] invitation the god of the Prophet went
[2:31:18] home to meet the prophet and said they
[2:31:21] they are come setting you up for a
[2:31:22] showdown he said but go there I will be
[2:31:25] with you so when they brought the
[2:31:27] invitation they said brother Braham oh
[2:31:30] God bless you the Brethren love you they
[2:31:32] want to have a fellowship with you
[2:31:34] please brother Braham said brother uh
[2:31:37] let's suppose let's think believe that I
[2:31:40] will not be able to make it can you
[2:31:42] represent me there uh he said uh it is
[2:31:45] you the one it is you the one the
[2:31:47] prophet said okay if it is me the mon I
[2:31:50] will come he said but you know what you
[2:31:53] are not actually inviting me for
[2:31:55] Fellowship you are inviting me for
[2:31:58] Showdown brother Bram how did you
[2:32:02] know I will be there for you to know I
[2:32:04] know the place you have rented to have
[2:32:07] the meeting they will not give
[2:32:10] you brother brah we have paid for it
[2:32:14] said it doesn't
[2:32:15] [Applause]
[2:32:17] matter then number two when you gather
[2:32:20] brother so and so we sit like
[2:32:23] this this will be the color of his shirt
[2:32:26] of his tie of his suit brother so and so
[2:32:29] brother so and so when that day came
[2:32:33] brother so and so the first thing was
[2:32:35] that sorry we can't give you this place
[2:32:37] we just check from our record somebody
[2:32:39] else had paid much earlier we are
[2:32:41] offering you another place the same
[2:32:43] place brother brah said they will do the
[2:32:45] meting it came to pass then on that day
[2:32:48] brother so and so sat like this brothers
[2:32:50] who are so sad like that the brother who
[2:32:52] brought invitation said before you call
[2:32:54] Brother Braham excuse
[2:32:57] me you may have your opinion about this
[2:33:01] man but I want you to know he knows what
[2:33:04] he's talking about and he's not afraid
[2:33:07] of any of
[2:33:11] you
[2:33:13] ah he told me we shall not have this
[2:33:16] that place we shall have here we are
[2:33:18] here he told me you sit like this you
[2:33:20] are there you will sit like this you are
[2:33:23] there I think that should have made them
[2:33:26] repented but they
[2:33:28] refus but it was God's way of allowing
[2:33:31] them to hear
[2:33:33] it then the prophet stated all the
[2:33:36] things that we believed and after he
[2:33:38] said if anybody have a contrary view
[2:33:42] with your Bible come here nobody came
[2:33:45] out till today they haven't come forget
[2:33:48] about this their little gener ation
[2:33:50] Rascals talking nonsense their fathers
[2:33:53] never
[2:33:54] [Applause]
[2:33:58] came they had enough opportunity they
[2:34:01] never came so we shall listen to this
[2:34:06] ones after the service instead of coming
[2:34:09] out they kept quiet after the service
[2:34:12] brother Braham oh we are so sorry we
[2:34:14] don't know that's how the thing is as a
[2:34:16] matter of fact we are coming to be
[2:34:19] baptized again I'm going to buy 70 of
[2:34:24] those tapes and send to all my
[2:34:27] parishes brother baram waited in
[2:34:30] 1965 they never
[2:34:32] came maybe if they come today we will be
[2:34:35] the one that we baptize
[2:34:38] them but they never came and the prophet
[2:34:41] in the message indictment came back he
[2:34:44] said do you watch those folks who said
[2:34:47] they were coming since 1958 of 59 they
[2:34:51] said they were coming we haven't seen
[2:34:52] them he said but do you know what they
[2:34:54] have done and do you know in that
[2:34:57] meeting it was over
[2:34:58] 300 that was like man camel Showdown
[2:35:02] again do you know that was
[2:35:04] representative of all the Pentecostal L
[2:35:06] this year see what happened it said they
[2:35:09] never came he said but do you know what
[2:35:11] they have done they confess that that
[2:35:14] thing was the truth they believed it was
[2:35:18] the truth but but refused to walk in it
[2:35:22] they committed unpardonable sin read the
[2:35:25] message
[2:35:29] indictment laia commit what is
[2:35:32] unpardonable sin in the message of
[2:35:34] pardonable sin brother brah said it is
[2:35:36] hearing the truth accepting that it is
[2:35:40] the truth and refusing to work in it
[2:35:43] there is the unpardonable sin so the
[2:35:46] church what committed unpardonable sin
[2:35:49] and the prophesy from that moment God
[2:35:51] will never save a church but he will
[2:35:53] bring individuals out of the church so
[2:35:57] there will never be a national Revival
[2:35:59] or a national salvation it will be one
[2:36:02] year one day coming out of all
[2:36:05] denominational
[2:36:07] grouping then in
[2:36:10] 1964 he pronounced them
[2:36:14] irredeemable in the message recognizing
[2:36:16] your day and its message he said loudest
[2:36:19] went past redemption in 1965 in the
[2:36:23] message ashamed of him he pronounced
[2:36:26] them
[2:36:27] dead that is why what you have been
[2:36:29] seeing today is a dead form of laaia I
[2:36:33] pity those of you who are still excited
[2:36:34] by
[2:36:37] Pentecost You Are exacted by a dead
[2:36:40] form it shows you are never born again
[2:36:43] because when life move it moves with
[2:36:46] everything if you want the true
[2:36:48] justification it in the message true
[2:36:51] sanctification is here true baptism is
[2:36:54] here then if you get through of those
[2:36:57] things you are going to be adopted it's
[2:36:59] as certain as anything finally RAB got
[2:37:03] out of love this year or Jero as you may
[2:37:06] call
[2:37:08] it and became what by the token became
[2:37:13] inducted into the economy of
[2:37:16] Israel and by that became marriage
[2:37:23] ah under no
[2:37:26] circumstance must you as a Believer
[2:37:29] marry an
[2:37:31] unbeliever it does not have a type in
[2:37:34] the
[2:37:35] Bible for you as a church member to
[2:37:39] follow before RAB could be marriageable
[2:37:42] in Israel she was inducted by the token
[2:37:46] she came into the economy of Israel by
[2:37:48] Redemption
[2:37:50] Ruth also came in by
[2:37:52] Redemption everyone that will be
[2:37:54] marriageable must come in by Redemption
[2:37:57] don't go out and pick them because you
[2:37:59] cannot redeem
[2:38:01] [Applause]
[2:38:05] them if you don't like that I'm sorry
[2:38:08] but I have a responsibility I've got to
[2:38:10] tell you the truth under no circumstance
[2:38:18] [Applause]
[2:38:20] and reab got married to a general in
[2:38:23] Israel and they gave birth to a child
[2:38:26] called
[2:38:28] the boas and boas got married to another
[2:38:32] redeemed Gentile and they gave bir to A
[2:38:35] Child Called HED and HED gave back to
[2:38:38] Jesse and Jess gave back to David and
[2:38:41] from David came the Lord Jesus Christ so
[2:38:44] the linage of these folks produce Christ
[2:38:47] when we marry right and receive receive
[2:38:49] the true justification will produce
[2:38:52] nothing but Christ outside of Jericho
[2:38:55] God bless
[2:38:56] [Applause]
[2:38:58] [Music]
[2:39:00] [Applause]
