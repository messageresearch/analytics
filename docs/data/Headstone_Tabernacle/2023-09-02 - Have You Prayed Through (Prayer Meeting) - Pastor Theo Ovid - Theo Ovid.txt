bride Buddhism into a full manifestation of Lord you promise there will be a manifestation of the sons of God may this be a platform Lord this time of prayer to bring us to that spot to bring us to that place God it's time for your sons to get their ranks and their position imas is a prophecy it is prophesied that we will each find our place in Christ and begin tonight may it come by Revelation inspiration to every believer granted Lord and Jesus I ask it amen amen God bless you and thanks for being here tonight uh you're gonna be doing other stuff other things but you choose to be in this virtual room tonight I have two portions of scripture like to read from James five 17-18 and also Luke chapter 11 11 to 13. and this James 5 the scripture that we familiar with Elias was a man's subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it ruined not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again in heaven give rain and the airport and fruit the Amplified of this scripture Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have with feelings affections and a constitution like ours only pretty not to Reign and no rain fell on the earth for three years in six months then he prayed again and Heaven supplied rain and the man produces crops as usual as usual Luke 11 if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he asks a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a Scorpio if Eden being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children or much more shall the heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him God bless you about one month ago we spoke on much time in prayer tonight we would like to touch on pray and true pray true to pray true this is more unseen words to God this is praying until you know not only he heard your prayer but you've got a response okay let's go tonight let's bear with me a few things and I trust that it will give you a key in Focus tonight in a child of Prayer Joshua was perseverant for he moved God said I give it to you and they were looking at what they could see Joshua was looking at what God Said it depends upon what you're looking at the Christian looks at the Unseen I I wish they could stick with us tonight the Christian looks at the Unseen the whole armor of Christianity is unseen Everlasting thing is unseen the things the Seeing Things Are material and the Earth is the mother of all of it but the Unseen the whole armor of God is an unseen Affair love joy peace Faith No suffering goodness meekness gentle so forth Holy Ghost spirit all that is unseen that's the last 10 things the Eternal things that's the whole power of God now everything the Christian can depend on is unseening the promise of God as we look at something that we don't see with our eyes by the way it's a secret your eyes you don't see the seed means to understand you look at anything right straight As I don't see it you mean you don't understand it when something has got an understanding that God made his promise and something has struck you that you believe that and that's the understanding that God promises to you and then something is going to happen then I don't care nobody in the world can talk you out of it you're on your road then nothing going to stop you and then he says about Washington you know the trials of boots America Washington when he prayed through he was ready and he said when men hear from God and know that it is scriptural then they can be persevered you've got to hear from God now watch and it's interesting because he brought a side of Charlotte Michigan Abednego that we would have never seen if God didn't send a prophet to show us this you know you hear the king accent the bow down and then you see me Will Not Bow Down and everything else we know this story but listen to this stuff could you imagine putting the holy ghost out of a man can't be done the bond these three Hebrew children put them in front of a steer start walking up the platform and they were to fall into this gratefulness I can hear shajak Sita Misha did you you sure you're pretty true listen this carefully he is dramatizing to Misha you're sure you're preacher oh my thought tonight is have you pretty true that's it that's the title I answered have you preached and sometimes isn't when Satan puts the heat on we have to stop and check up Lord do I truly believe you I can hear say yes it's all prayed up now he said you want to take that back boy nope we are willing to seal Our Testimony with our own life we already know I can hear King number Canada say well if your wooden ball don't get the image the ticket back he said no we have took our way with the Lord despise you we know the story so the summary of that is [Music] already prayed through they wasn't wondering uh you know what I was saying what I would talk to the Lord further boom wouldn't have he control Waters you see I'll go down there I can hear him say one word your good Angel you obeyed me ever since I created you I can't let you go he said Lord have you considered yes I've been watching them all night long I have watched them all night long I heard them in the prayer meeting last night I hear them when they pray true and they struck every year with their prayers oh brother Ovid it have prayers and prayers yes it has prayed I could stay right under your roof in your house either of prayer that can strike him let me read it again this is Brother Branham seeing like what the Lord is saying I've heard him in their permission last night I heard him when they pray true and they struck Heaven here with their prince I'm watching them I know when they caught one more step to go I have been watching them all night long I can't let you go because it's a man-sized job I'm going down myself we know the story he's talking about Abraham uh talking about Iran in the holiest of holies man is fresh not contaminated and then he says that and the veil drops over you see what I mean when the real is from the outside world he said was you ever so lost in Christ so pray true this is not saying prayers so pray true until the world you had no more to do with it at all you walk humbly every day before Christ loving in fruits in other words you're not that Christian on Sunday because you're in church among church folks and by by Monday like a semi level or like a holy person or like you don't know who you are or like you're you're completely different from how you are Sunday your Sunday status or or activity like if you go back and listen to in his presence mom says put his presence between you and your sins put his presence between you and Allah put your prince presence between you online and you want whatever it might be that troubling your life put his presence see see this the Lord is before me I shall not be moved the Lord is before me let's continue what Rama speaking about a service atmosphere and he was speaking on the subject of the resurrection of Christ when a big old boy is standing there around to The Altar and hollered God have mercy on my soul now listen to this and when he came up he never got all the way to the altar hardly there was about 50 of those old grannies out there grab them around the neck down to the altar they took him so this boy get convicted he said caught on Mercy on my soul he's wrong to be older and about 50 of these grannies they didn't tell them come and pray for them and somebody are you altered no the grannies run hold him down and begin to pray with them there was about 50 some odd conversions that afternoon no they didn't get down there with a dry eye confession and get up they prayed with him about two hours I guess they got up listen listen to this and their clothing was so wet just ringing them out where they perspired they got up and shouted gone through the woods up over the hills they were hollering hallelujah hallelujah that they might be embarrassing but they had the old-time Holy Ghost religion that's the truth so in those deeds somebody come to the altar the old granny is the old folks in the spirit they have a reason for that soul and they went after him pre-reading for two hours and when they finish their clothing was went let's continue get that old cancer condition away from the church get out of it woman get out of it men not only women but men too and preacher also you have let down the bar pastor there is something wrong with you you haven't prayed truth or you will absolutely see your congregation getting in that condition you will stand and resist the thing if you preach the forwards that's exactly the truth so everybody's coming here everybody's covered man woman pastor you've got to preacher he said what we need is an old-fashioned scoring out cleaning up are you Pentecostal people don't watch the practice and Presbyterian are going to take a blessing and go to Glory with it famous practice ministers and Presbyterian and lutherans are receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost saying we are hungry Faith by the brand we are hungry with it or we are going on and on some of the outstanding men in the nation hungering for god let's clean up let all of us the Lutheran the Baptist the Presbyterian the Pentecostal we are not divided we are one big church let's go from Victory to Victory no it's over cleanup right clean up is your testimony to God that you are expecting something you are preparing your heart you're preparing your mind you're preparing to receive praise the Lord let's continue okay one day while everyone was praying no doubt he prayed through till he struck the hand of God how did how did he do it by faith perhaps he taught like this if he is a God who made the ark I let Noah flow through he still lives today somewhere in the land of the heathens he is the journey and you touch the hand of God in Dear God give him a revelation and there was a situ's build and maker was God and we read about Abraham's life he had faith that there was a city whose building America was God and eternal system he had a purpose in life to find that place so watch this the Revelation whereas Republic Abraham that there's a city who is making the list God when that struck his soul his purpose become become I'm going to find that City so he's seeking a city whose making deliveries God no here is them you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it what's the challenge for a lot of young people today got no purpose they live in day-to-day living almost like I exist existed but without purpose there is no point of Direction because the purpose with vision with Revelation you have a destination and you want to get there so whether you have to drop friends family relatives whether you have to give up this and give up that you do it because you want to find harmony with the purpose that God raised you up from so hear what he's in again these are powerful words you can't purpose and this applies for tonight they come that you personally receive the Holy Ghost you put bless the night together breakthrough you purposely get delivered you propose a night that your life will be changed you can't poop us anything of God's promise yeah here we go get away in your heart touch your head in your heart without finding the reality to it if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts ups and downs frustrations and there is something done in you that is telling you that there is somewhere you can overcome that why do you float around them from church to church from place to place just kneel down till you strike heaven could I read it again if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustrations and there is something wrong in you telling you that there is some way you can overcome that why do you fluke from church to church from place to place just knead on till you strike him as I said last night go beyond the song barriers then you will have a purpose in life you'll have purpose in belonging to the church you'll have purpose in being baptized you will have purpose in what you are seeking for cause we know God is honest God is true and God cannot lie and if God please start into Abraham's heart but his voice his word then God has placed it in before us in this Bible by the witness of the Holy Spirit by The Return of the Holy Spirit and sign them Wonders that Jesus still lives and is the same yesterday today and forever if you need whatsoever that God has promised in his Bible he is here tonight to meet that need no need of seeking further his presence is here his spirit is here and he is willing and ready and longing to give you what you are seeking for why would you wait any longer so that is the top part written in Bowl written in black and white he is willing and ready and longing to give you what you are seeking for a support type now watch let's go to Define writing now this is this is this is a subset of this bowl writing on top next verse when you come to him don't come as a flute I will go up and try and see if it works you will never get no way so he's actually putting a clause of what we just read he's willing to give you but showing you how you must come the approach listen to this but when you come with this kind of determination that you have sold out Lock Stock and Barrel you are tired of the world and sin and unbelief and frustration and doubts and come to the Living God with the anchor surely tightening in the Rock of Ages the holy spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the Living God and that will give you a fate that will overcome anything there is in the world sickness disease and even death itself when I go to pray I will get out in the woods the green Briars you don't have them here do you we have plenty of them back in the East and they scratch you you get over here The Sun Shines down through the trees on you you get on the hillside you're praying like this and there are too many rocks mosquitoes is biting everything when you get to that kind of place just through your arms say hallelujah God you're calling me I'm answering to you something is going to happen that's right because there's a blessing lean deal and Satan is trying to fight you he's an old means spitfoot anyhow you know he's trying his best to keep you from that blessing just stay there till you're pretty true I don't care that the mosquitoes bite whatever takes place just stay with it because Satan will rob you from that if he possibly can and we come to our last quote tonight the last one if you haven't yet received the Holy Spirit listen my precious problem as many times as people talk against it not being today for today the Holy Spirit oh don't you leave this conference room until you receive it you still right with God don't make your way you if you want to receive it see you have got in your mind that you have to see something or some sensation when you go in there to pray and you're just going saying Lord I come into all you have to say is Lord I come to get the Holy Ghost so he's saying do have things in your mind you want some sensation or no don't have that thingama say Lord I come in to get the Holy Ghost and he will take care of the rest of it you just be real sincere break down your all your thoughts you're not going to receive it that break down all your thoughts of of you're not going to receive it remember tonight is the night you're going to receive it see that's just it like it was an old man this one died he couldn't keep saved he would get saved and then after a while you lose something wrong the devil will say you see you never got saved well that went on for a long time and one day he got out in the field and he prayed through again he said now Lord I know you saved me so he said Satan I'm going to do something to you then he went over got him an ax chop him a great big long stub drove it down into the ground and said Sita if anything you ever come to me and tell me I am not safe I'm going to bring you right back and point to this tub right here is where it has happened I am saved from this on let's buy our hands Heavenly Father this is what I I had in my heart a lot to share with your people tonight about praying through not just praying or saying prayer or saying words but pre and true Lord David I pray true when he went to meet Goliath he did not pray up he didn't didn't have to seek the Lord he already prayed through Daniel already prayed through and that's why when they're dropping it in the lines then it could have that atmosphere wrong and the land couldn't eat it when you look back the secret of all these Hues of Faith they actually pray true in their child in their tests there was no getting feed they had feet that is why they could deal with the trial and their tests even Jesus before he hit Calgary he had to hit the gardener gets sending and right in that Garden is where he prayed through father if it's possible let this Compass father if it's possible please let this cup pass three times father if it is possible let's go past nevertheless not my will but the guy will be done and when he closed the gap his subconscious conscience when he closed the gap of his will and God's Will and when he broke through that was the lion of the tribe of Judah revealing he broke through father tonight I pray that the britual anointing will come upon every person on the song of my voice every person in their room the Lord that your spirit would come upon them and Inspire them in this time of prayer in Jesus am I ask it amen and amen there you have it tonight I trust them that this was helpful for you and that you would recognize that God wants you to break through amen so may the Lord bless you as we go down here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
