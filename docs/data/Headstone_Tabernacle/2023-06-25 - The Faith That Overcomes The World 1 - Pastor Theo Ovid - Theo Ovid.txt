miss this morning and just let me ask it God bless you and welcome it's good to be here and the host of God want to welcome brother Isaac back he was out to Ghana praise God and blessing the young people across there amen God bless you say for the Bibles I'd like you to turn to three portion of scriptures this morning thank you musicians thank you Anthony for the song service and the atmosphere and uh oh we have to guard an atmosphere uh Saint Mark chapter 11 we want to read verse 22-26 Hebrews 11 from one to six and first John five we want to read verse two to four Mark 11 and Jesus answering said unto them her faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he have whatsoever he shall have whatever he said wherefore I send to you what things however you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and he shall have them when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which in heaven forgive your trespasses Hebrews chapter 11. William from verse one no feet it's a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report true faith we understand that the world's refrained by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things were to appear by Fate Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and buy it he being dead yet speak it by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see that I was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without fit it is impossible to please him for he that come into God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Allah scripture from first John chapter 5 reading from verse 2. by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous it's not Buddhism it's not over heavy okay verse four for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen let's spot Pray Again father we thank you for your word and we have read it and we pray that your spirit will come and bring life and bring life to the people this morning granted Lord and Jesus might ask it amen amen you may be seated praise God you know brother Branham said he hope other ministers take the word he's trying to lay in the seeds and he hope to take it and make more sense to it and he didn't stop there like ever since to make an argument but make sense it and he hope that they bring the seats to life so the object of all these bible promises and Bible Sees God wanted to come to life Governor wanted in a book God wanted on a tape he don't want it to just reason on it and listen to it and you listen to the word he wanted to become life the scripture declares and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us so when the world becomes flesh in you the word lives itself out you are not living you the word living through you by you and through you that we're gonna live question do you believe that do you even believe that is possible that this word could live through you and by you do we even think that you could live a Victorious Life after coming through so many defeats that you don't forget every time you go back and ring it says licks again you get so much blues and let me know again he says looks coming you know you're going in because you had to go in but his blog not this morning not this morning you have a place where you could draw a line and said not this time not today you are you and you know you you are you and you know all your failures and your shortcomings and your mistakes and your errors and your sins you are you nobody will tell you about you you know yourself then you know it takes a greater power to deal with you nobody can handle you nobody can manage you it will take the spirit of the Living God Moses could reimagine himself with all the knowledge he had that he was born to be delivered Moses couldn't take care of himself with all the information that he was born from mighty task and a mighty Ministry and a mighty calling he couldn't do nothing until he met the pillar of fire until God came on that mountain until God tell him I know normal God I'm the god of your fathers I was with Abraham I was with Isaac I was with Jacob and I come to tell you I come not to be with you oh give the Lord a praise that's the god you need to meet this morning not no paper God not not book God but a reality how many hungry for that this morning testing for a manifested reality glory to God many of us come to church because our parents come a husband come wife come we have not yet entered a god encounter you may be seated Moses after his intellectual experience and it was an experience because that experience caused him to fight he killed a man and then he recognized water more than flowers we would say he had all the tongue had done out the thing altogether until God was ready for him God gave him time with a hot tempered wife God gave him a time to do homework God getting our time to relax himself as if nothing is moving it was a relaxing time for Moses the people of Israel was not burden no more there was out of sight outer mind out the sight out of mind until until something Supernatural begin to move and God couldn't speak to him until Moses turned aside to Sea and someday you have to turn inside to see oh glory to God you have to turn aside to see to have an interest in what God wanted to talk to you because God wants to speak to you and God wants you to speak back to him or give the Lord some Praises you talk to your husband you talk to your wife you talk to your family you talk to your children your in-laws your Outlaws you talk to all of them but you have to talk to God Almighty okay the Lord some Praises this morning oh glory to God and the first thing God said I've heard the cries of my people Oh Glory to God I know that that the pain I know the the the the the the the the the trials are not the sorrows and God know your pain God know your child God know your Sorrows God knows it it's not like he doesn't know it or glory to God hallelujah praise God and at the ending of the prayer meeting on Friday Zoom permitted something struck my heart he said and he come to me and I wrote it out he leave the storm but give you peace he leave the Affliction but give your grace okay the Lord some Praises you hear that sometimes you want the storm to go away but God leaves the storm there but give you peace he gave you peace in the midst of your storm oh give the Lord some Praises this morning he is God Almighty and he chained that not Hallelujah in the midst of disputes to give your brotherly kindness you leave the hit and give you love Oh Glory to God when God everybody angry and carrying on God give you mercy and Grace to shut your mouth and keep quiet be still and know that I am God he'll make a way for you oh Gloria Rock the enemy he will shut them out of the critics he will take a rag and jam it inside their mouths I have never seen a righteous forsaken or exceed bread bread Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he will make a table for you in the presence of your enemies your cup gonna run over I am believing that starting this morning I am believing not starting today oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God [Music] Chloe [Music] when was dry season I it was something else for me to look and see when the rain trying to come there's dry season and sometimes I set up dark and you see the rain one to come and you know who will win that battle you should understand shake it off because dry season so the Sun have the upper hand but when is rainy season sometimes it's rain the Sunshine's shining normal normal and in 10 minutes hold them that close like they have a commission to cover the sky and to bring rain you know the season change when the season change you can't nothing about it you know when winter coming to stay together are going out normal normal clothing you're freezing because season change and when the season change for you God the word the promise no devil could stop it all the demons that haunt and you taunting you they can't stop what God is about to do what God is about to release praise God Amen so this morning have a title defeat that overcomes the world the Fate that overcomes the world and you know in the permission now speaking about whatever you asked for in my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you you see and sometimes and when I when it struck me I start to repent because I realized that we are seeing that t is the I am but there's a level of unbelief in the power of that I am because you are saying I am I am your lawyer I am your doctor I am your healer I am also why you are anxious if he's a provider why are you questioning if you know he gonna make a way for you it come like when Moses was told by the commission to bring them to this place to worship me Moses knew he had a return ticket but Moses was demonstrating oh God Christ look God said white behind me speak and move forward I give you a commission to bring them straight through so if God say your family will be delivered we've got to tell you your family will be delivered I don't care what they're doing now that will God say that's what you have to believe you can't believe different if God said you are going to be delivered you are going to be delivered you don't know how you don't know when but today might be your day but you are going to be delivered and have a time limit on things you know it doesn't go on and on and on you know even time is above a limit God put a limit on time God put a limit on your bondage he said I've heard the cries of my people it had it had all kind of characters among them people but he heard their cries Peter to do this Striker to do that push it to the Taskmaster hanging over you but God coming to break the power of the task master and see it with a portal and complete deliverance faith is the victory that overcomes the world so when you begin to see the I Am whatever he you have need of then you could have confidence in him you could have full trust in him oh glory to God that's why David can say don't ten thousand fall on my right side I shall not be moved because what my shield my popular my strong and mighty tower you are my help Lord glory to God some trust and Men some trust and horses but I trust in the Lord so David had a testimony of his trust in God what about David David had the same testimony God delivered me from the beer God delivered from The Lion and this Goliath oh he wanna be delivered into my hands do you believe that today oh praise God so let's get into the message Mark 11 23. if you shall say to this mountain and this is the God we serve he like to give you the end picture to see where you are predestinated unto to see where you are destined onto this year the third pull if you shall speak if you shall say to the mountain and believe in your heart you can have what you say but before you use you have to ask you have to be able to be and speaking things with God so Jesus said if you shall see then he said when you pray believe you have received and you shall have it now that is a little lower than speaking speaking you have it speaking and it's right there Peter heal below seal below deliver devil go you speak it you have it but before you reach dear he put ask When you pray I'll give you an exercise just believe you have receive it before you get it and I would say get it before you get it you believe you're getting it before you get it because faith is already the substance of what you're hoping for so the revelation of God comes down into your heart as a fate that you have seen the manifestation yet but you believe it Abraham couldn't show exactly anybody but he had Isaac as a fate seed Revelation in his soul nobody could take that out and that comes for your deliverance that comes for your healing that come from your breakthrough that come from your ceiling that come from whatever you have need of it comes inside a deal by a revelation of God that no man can give you only God could give you somebody Gonna Leave You heal today praise God I am speaking it I am believing it somebody only get delivered today praise God because the world brings Deliverance the word brings healing and God is the author of his own word and he will vindicate his word do you believe that so not because somebody opening them out the praying God is listening David said in Psalm 66 if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me you could pray for an hour two hours ten hours 24 hours God will not hear you if there's iniquity in your heart and iniquity is knowing to do right and doing wrong iniquities when you have condemnation in your heart to have the freedom to praise and worship God that was the devil's job is to make sure you got your Light Tangled Up and tied up now when you come to church there's no praise there's no worship you're sitting down here and the wooden hit in your head not your heart praise God but when iniquity is out you could worship God you could praise God Psalm 6 18 if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me but verily God had heard me he had attended unto the voice of my prayer blessed be God which had not turn away my prayer nor his Mercy from me Proverbs 15 29 the Lord is far from the wicked but here at the prayer of the righteous Oh Glory to God and you're not righteous in yourself you're righteous because you're under the blood of Jesus you're righteous because of his righteousness the Lord here with the prayer of the shout out righteous right standing with God it's not right Hallelujah glory to God and in Proverbs 15 29 in the Amplified said the Lord is far from the wicked but he hears the prayer of the consistently righteous the upright in right standing with him Matthew 24 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many not some of many Church message Believers the love of many with the wax call they will go to church and just go and warm a bench they will wear dress covenantes in service and then outside the knees they dress above the knees they watch cold they have problems having their nails clean face cleaned their problems standing and walking as a Christian that Muslim coming from head to toe only the eyes have it you only see nice in a hot day they wearing black socks black dress black top black veil everything black just their eyes they see it and they're walking proudly but questions have a fight Oh Glory to God but there's a Mrs Jesus Christ that I'm called to address I'm not called to address others I'm called to speak to the bride it's just I don't know who is who so I preaching to everybody who give the Lord some Praises inside of here my God my God I don't know who is who I have no position and power to put you in and I can't put you out what I know is the kingdom is preached and there every man every man every man or get the Lord a shelter praise all glory to God you have access today oh you don't have to go to the priest you have the word and you have faith in your soul you could press like never before and I challenge you in your seat do something like you have never done before or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah amen amen amen let's go what is faith faith is a revelation when Jesus asked them who do men said they were anxious and excited to talk about what others saying about him and there are some people like that they could talk to you about others they can't talk to you about themselves they can't come real with you she said he said them say what about you hey but Jesus said who do you say I am and they were dumb from gold and get them volume all them they can't talk now and Peter broke you and said don't matter to Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed unto you so he sees difference when you have a revelation when you do a religion there are many people don't have any Revelation they believe but to do for Revelation Revelation is when he revealed it to you when they come from heaven when I jump on your soul your wife can't take that out pressure can't take that out amen what conditions can't take that out you can't believe today and don't believe tomorrow what kind of Revelation is that there's no Revelation at all you never had a revelation Revelation is a rock Revolution Revelation is based upon something solid fatal just float faced us wrestling a foundation glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see when God say I am the god of your fathers and then call Abraham and Jacob and Isaac and so on when he called that you know all those people in history they know the history of their tribe they know the history of the lineage and they know God truly was with this man Oh Glory to God the Bible said while they were few very few he suffered no man to do them wrong he suffered no man to do them wrong saying touch not my anointed [Applause] praise God nobody could do wrong to this bride there's the Bride of Jesus Christ the greatest battle ever thought we coming under the home stretch this is a championship belt this is the heavyweight champion of the world Lucifer fully says the bride that Jesus Christ will consulate churches Putin of his bombs Russia have his problems America have the nuclear bombs North Korea bombs Iran Bombs all them are bombs but now bum bums could move but one bomb could fall until this bride get out of here the most important people on this planet Earth today is the Bride of Jesus Christ if you can't read or write you are still the most important person on the earth on the Earth today oh give the Lord Our Praise You are not ordinary glory to God God qualified purpose God elected you for this hour Oh Glory the devil will be defeated he is defeated Christ defeated him he said have the power I have the keys of death and Hell oh boy recorder when I talk about faith overcoming the world I'm not just talking about things and problems and issues and situations I am talking about your mortality putting on immortality it will take Faith to do that to overcome this time Dimension to break into our Rapture in faith and wrapped in condition Oh Glory to God a little more than going to church a little more unbelieving the word it will take Faith because Enoch had it okay the Lord some praises Enoch was translated Oh Glory to God either overcome gravity or glory to God he was walking one morning all of a sudden he couldn't tell his wife goodbye they're between a bed one taken one left he couldn't tell his children to go in he was walking all of a sudden his feet got very light okay the Lord I shout it was a wrapped in the sea it was a seat that was overcoming gravity will not come in the world overcoming these five senses [Applause] my [Applause] let me see that I don't understand why anybody don't wouldn't want to break out wouldn't want to break out of what they end is that scripture because they might people like it so you know the like false prophets they're like lying prophecies they like some heavy Mysteries with no life behind it the life interpretation and electoralism to get them are warmth in the spirit because you see this is the atmosphere that you're in and religious spirit don't want to be elsewhere they want to be in a church atmosphere it's a religious spirit I know what is faith faith is what what is Faith it is God by the spirit revealing to you something that he is going to do or he promised God revealing to you something he is going to do or what he promised yet his bum if you only hear Faith come by hearing watch how deep this is if you only hear fake on my hearing but hearing is not faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread hearing only brings the word that produces faith so you can't say casually Faith come my hearing and hear him by the word of God not yet not so you hear the word to bring you into faith so hearing is the channel by which you get the word to activate Faith inside of you and faith is the victory that overcomes the world that's a little bit here I'm gonna do the same thing under here and do the same thing because it's not revealed it's not unfolded it has to be revealed to you oh glory to God and then Is Anchored in your soul and only your spirit's job is to bring

somebody you love your husband you love your wife there's no need of anybody telling you you don't because you do it you know you do it and if I ask you how can you prove you do it oh I prove it by the way I lifting him I'm true on his wife I'm loyal on his husband that proves to me that I love my wife or I love my husband see your life proves what you are the same thing Christianity does your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure something real and you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it but your action prove it get a partner when you got a pure unadulterated feet like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more so you see people complaining they shorter that fate I want to say they have no vision but they're short it's instead of a tall fit short feet you ain't complaining no more you know it's done walk along no matter what the thing look like what anybody else say you know that's happening you

rivers of God the function of blessing just flowing out to the people see what I mean no you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it is actually taking place just talk Mira says deceive by preaching Mysteries and the Mysteries is evidence they adopted because the sons of God will bring up the Mysteries Hidden Mysteries but Christ is a mystery so when they bring up their Mysteries they must reveal Jesus Christ we want to see Jesus Christ we want to hear your mouth we want to see Christ we want Christ where to remain flesh then we see a living his presence you might have a force feeling wrong there ain't nothing much they're not moving they're not they're not in Hollywood you know there's a presence when you're walking there you get checked you know you can't just worry Prophet yeah I got a bunk say the presence that is there you know oh give the Lord some praises the bride will have that you will have that come on come on preach back to me somebody come on now I wanna I wanna put some Faith inside of you I want you to understand you can no longer hide from the Devil taller than you and hide in your head but that devil see that light over you never see Mama my

house glory to God I'll never forsake you glory to God hallelujah and because that light is over you the devil wants to jam you he know who to fight he know to put pressure on why you think you have it so hard because the devil sees something about you that is why you have it so hard why don't a person ever so easy they've seen nothing there okay the Lord some Praises oh give the Lord some Praises in the house [Music] remember season so this private Christianity you want to run at a weekend I see when I was my job the first time I was just that I'm a Christian like I want you to be held accountable so I come here jumped in a Christian next major he could not smoke in a cigarette he said but look at Christiana I need smoking so I don't want him not to know my Christian so I could compromise I want him to know my Christian so then they could pull him up to do that afterwards when people normally Christian thing when they come into the presence The Substitute because look looky come in early Christians stop because you're bringing presents now you're bringing an atmosphere all glory to God hallelujah you have to believe that you know I knew that you know when I walk I know I walk away atmosphere you know and atmosphere more powerful than every devil in the office [Applause] some praises Hallelujah you know that cushion that they never got sick pins in you're a Christian all right so let's go again you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it's actually taking place so somebody say about you has dispersed you on a dream about your boy he was right next to the archangel I see a light and I see a distance myself that's fine how come you see me dead how come you see many books because we got to get to all them things people always see a lot of things but they didn't seem cavalry yeah they're docking everything else there but if there's no country there's no Resurrection dead man so if you have the resurrection power Resurrection God's blessing God has to take you to something David said do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil for thou art with me that I read and stuff they Comfort Me Oh Glory to God hallelujah there's always that value after pass through pissing on both sides devil hissing on this side of hissing that side and all you keep focused don't look at them he says let them keep listening they can't make it you can't make it you're going too far you're not supposed to go there we are supposed to go no we're the sons of God we are supposed to go return in trouble we are supposed to go Oh Glory to God I'm going to the Lord I'm going under the Hill from and call my help I will look unto the hill so make up my help comes from the Lord and when you recognize where hell coming from you could get strength to press on and get a picture in God you need to break through this morning [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] now first let me go are we doing good at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it here's why because they had Christ walking with them but then afterwards Christ was in them so he could walk with you and not in you walking with you he's still with you oh I'll never leave you I'll never see you walking with you but he wants to get into you do you believe that so you see it's hard then to have this perfect fit without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it it does so the same Holy Spirit the people reject is what have to bring the Fate and to leave this earth to overcome this world to overcome gravity we need defeat look at our tragedy this week on here a man take some people long to see Titanic the wreck and the ship just disintegrate and blow up when they check him out no he do a thing he tracking it wasn't legitimate it wasn't qualified it wasn't the constructed right and it blew up people lost their lives a billionaire and a son they say they would have died instantly I wonder what was the condition of their soul because they have the money they could go down to see a wreck that was wreck since 1912 or 1916 or whatever was wrecked and Tyler was wrecked when they say not even God could sing this ship and go through them who is the boss put it to the Bottom of the Sea not even God could sing the ship so proud was it wasn't man's achievement God sink it it's still down there people lost their lives Hallelujah leaning on the strength of mans and man's ability lean on the strength of Demands and Man's power Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God glory to God so it's hard to have this perfect fit without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it no the disciples didn't have the perfect fate for the other epileptic child there and they were trying to cast this devil out and they couldn't do it and the father seen Jesus come and said we brought my son to your disciples and they could not kill him afterwards the disciples asked Jesus why could we not kill him and Jesus said because of lack of faith no God Jesus give him power but they had some level of unbelief unconscious unbelief they themselves didn't even know they were lacking in faith they thought was business unusual come on devil and their customers saying that and they will come out and moving but that epilepsy here moving but I didn't say that episode talk back to them I said listen Jesus told the class but not one of you could do it the spirit had to talk back to them Jesus told you all to cast me out I'm not one of you could do it and Jesus no come out of adoption he know coming of the mountain quietly he's walking down the mountain now and he said the devil said the German one time yes I don't talk yet does everyone want to know where to go how fast to go is to go immediately or immediately immediately you want to know faster get other side of there because our power coming I live in faith I live in virtue and living knowledge I live in Temperance and living patience and living godliness and living Godly kindness charity the love of God a life walking down with Thunders lightning and voices every devil has shaken up oh give the Lord some praises oh Gloria let me see if I can say you know wow remember let's continue they had the power here we go Jesus had given them power to heal the sick to raise the dead and cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the Fate to use the power did you get that church they had power but not the faith to move the power then he said no there's Ibraham Tabernacle there's the church The Brighter Day the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got the faith to move it it takes faith to move it it takes faith to move it sober the brown gods and a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers that we could take the faith and move the power okay the Lord I shall do you get that now could do you get that job [Applause] not to stand up here and explained mysteries for the last 50 years and we can't be the chance they are that name is not just a name I mean we'll have a reputation of killing people and he said if he had the gun he should have gone unpaid but amidst that you both come and he said gosh he forgets a gun and then he says something came over him you see that something you need that something what if he did not have something he said bull this mystery of these Seven Seas and seven trumpets in seven violence and seven wolves so one of his son don't understand that language the language people understand is the language of l-o-v-e love that's the original language that Adam had when he was dominating over the Beast of the field Adam had love flowing through him or give the Lord a praise Hallelujah through the fall of Man he got that love broken so he and Eve have this harmony because it's a brick of the connection with God every husband had no connection how the wife go connect with that the wife of connection holy husband connect with that both have to connect with God then they can connect with other when when it was broken relationship was broken because Adam connection with God was broken so everything else was broken oh give the Lord some praise do you see it now Hallelujah prayed so love came over by the Branham and the bull coming down he said bull I come to pray for a civil of God just go and lie down foreign [Applause] foreign take a day off from this bullish business you're in and the bullet can lie down and pray for the sick and everything was fine oh my this power is really little that's what Adam had oh Gloria that's what the bride going to have do you believe that didn't happen the brother Branham Just for information sake you know that is for revelation's sake to understand what we have to deal with we have to confront our Bulls we have to confront our goliaths we have to confront our Philistines we have to confront everything that the devil could lose after us yeah there is the church the bright today the holy spirit is said with the power but you haven't got the Fate To Move It see what I mean it takes Faith to move it here I got a shell I hand loaded it right he said but fire I have to get to the powder the powder is got the power it's got to have fire to let it off and Perfect Fit here we go well Terence here it is perfect fit to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit that we have now since he come upon us foreign they can't break this this is Unbreakable not because you're in any message listen to any tape or any book you wouldn't any rapture you have to have the same thing Enoch had or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah have to have the same faith that Enoch had he said we'll take more faith to leave here because you are believing this Mortal will put on immortality so you gotta faithful to take come on now you can't fit for your children and you want to claim that they have faith to be changing the movement of an eye you have to start the exercise of it right now right this moment I am that I am if you're backstain he's a restorer they get sick he's a Healer I am whatever you want me to be I am that I am or if any Deliverance see the deliverer come on now don't dunk the spawn of Deliverance so God and your condition here and the condition here but he can deliver you stop talking about your condition talk about the deliverer talk about the restorer talk about the Healer talk about the baptizer come on say Amen somebody [Applause] fit to ignite to something that's presented to you with a heart full of joy you walk into a sick room knowing exactly what you're going to say you walk in there and know what's going to happen something already been revealed and you know it you're walking in the name of Jesus Christ rise up from there just say the Lord there you are that's perfect fit oh my if there were 10 million people standing there saying it wouldn't happen you know it's going to happen anyhow cause you know it it's going to happen regardless of what anybody else says you are the one that got the Fate Oh Glory to God Jesus told his disciples go to the Village you're gonna meet a man have a donkey nobody never sits on him tell any Master need it Oh Glory to God hallelujah that man anointed to lose that donkey oh Chloe oh God he can't say the best donkey donkey that's okay order he said tell that man the master need that donkey and Jesus dropping that donkey and he come riding

trying to disturb you are trying to rock your spirit out of one belief shake your alter the flesh shake you out of the humanistic realm shake out of your five senses and let you enter into our faith faith for your own self fade for your family faith for your breakthrough faith-free Deliverance faith for the Holy Ghost faithful Revival you've got to have that this morning oh my my hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God hallelujah remember they had the word and the Word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power I give you power they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the wood that was in them not how we place that what's the secret the word is in the bride and what is telling us now you have to have faith to operate the word that is in you God put the word in you you see when 1906 came and the Holy Ghost fell it fell among people without the word so Pentecostal was shocked they had the anointing they had tongues they had signs and wonders but they had nothing to hold it because the prophet didn't come yet so they didn't have the word to hold it so God was using men men in adultery men fornicating men with other people's wives and so on God's still using them but God purposed not so again he's not a prophet to bring the word and the world will bring us into character character formation by the Charles of our faith and that character will connect with power Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises so this is not the Pentecostal age where God using flesh God using his own word in you okay the Lord some Praises do you get that tonight do you get that this morning he is not using men he's using the word he put him in [Music] [Applause] so you sitting there must be able to see the operation of God as the spirit of God take the man of God and spit all the ways out of his mouth you know it's not a man is the spirit speaking expressly ministering to you Oh Glory to God hallelujah they didn't have the power the Fate to operate the word that was in them see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith in what he said would happen Oh my he had Faith with his power so he cannot power and no faith and they gotta faith and no power but he needs to come together it's not right praise God he said I can't do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied on knowing he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word you see that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word what has God Made You God called you all to what to be a church member or God called it to be the Bride of Jesus Christ God Called It Be the wife of the Lamb you talk about I'm not worthy that's not the issue worthiness that come into this question is what God choose oh give the Lord a shout when elieza was praying for a bride for Isaac he said Lord let the damself come that offer me to feed my camera with water praise God and give me water and feed my camel Also let her be the damself is a good thing God didn't tell that in a text message to all them sisters in that area hold everyone with buckets one time to feed him but Ilyas I prayed in his heart and here come Rebecca

[Applause] Magic glory to God now you're going past my children now assuming for my grandchildren now please go to Sami Samuel was there with a stick one time I say looking like Moses he dropped his sick one time he said no no I said you dropped the second one time I say look like most say look at him you're running for me calling you might want to be Moses yet I want to be Spider-Man and everything else praise God but God coming for them because prayers hanging over them and when you chop them prayers over your children drop them prayers over your family if you die the prayers still stand if they die the person that file and when they go go take your present pour it out don't stop praying don't stop sighing don't stop crying oh give the Lord some praises [Applause] Hallelujah so you have to have faith that you're a believer a believer of this word isn't that right all right here we go as long as you're doing things wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you're automatically know you're wrong you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing your own the devil don't have to bother with you you know he just know you're doing it wrong he said leave that one alone that one called them already up like Moses and put a brick underneath it they're doing nothing because the heart condemned already so the first thing I want to do is like take that condemnation out of your heart that you don't leave they're condemned you could leave her with a relief when when brother Branham the taxman was terrorizing by the brand and the man came to the front of the house he run outside tell you I tell him tell him tell him I know this idea so you run on the house technically he's outside that technical thing and I'm not inside the house I'm not when he did that I think somebody come and bring a baby fame or something like that and he prayed God say hypocrite Amanda pray for the sick make that right first he had a cold attack myself listen I was right there decided I tell my wife the lie to say I wasn't there and when he correct that he could come and pray and go dancing so don't be surprised if I need to make things right make it right make it right and go go hear your prayer go gonna answer your prayer go gonna give you that breakthrough as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you you know you're a Believer there's nothing between you and God you can ask what you will and know it will be given because it's the word is given to you just like those disciples the only thing you have to do then is to have faith in what you are have faith and what the words say you are so it's not so much you you know is what God placed you what God called you to oh my Hallelujah praise God praise God A Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus had perfect feet he had it because he was the word are you ready now that sounds good right this will song even better and you become the word as you receive the word [Applause] that's not good enough I want the devil I want you to say Amen to let the devil know whose side you're on you become the word as you receive the word and when you say and when you say Amen you are confirming you're receiving the word your amen is the word receipt [Applause] [Music] if you're abiding me and my Wiz abiding you my words abide in you then you can ask what you will and be done to you it's not right no watch no he said if you abide in me and my wood in you said John you can ask what you will will be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer you have got to recognize your position as he recognized his position let's go we're in homes not really you know on page five on page six of page 12 not much Pages we should have been way down the road right now but but I have to do what I'm doing right now praise God for some of them people here the exam movie you know so they could take gospel no you know how to study now with CXC and GC whatever it is yeah exam over so that word could hit you hard amen oh no watch let's go Jesus live in a world that no one knewed about he was the odd person you live in a world of perfect fit in the perfect God which he was if we live in a perfect fit of a Christian to what we are will be a Mystic to the world the people won't understand you you're walking the spirit and when the spirit said you will do what it forbid you will not do then the people begin to say there's a Mystic person that's the way it is to all believers their Mystic the people don't understand because they live in the world to themselves Jesus live in a world that nobody else could touch disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke they said what are you talk to us and riddles we don't understand it what so when a man lives by faith here we go I mean substance faith so he's defining the kind of it not just say talk faith in the message believe I believe no substance faith what he is isolating on the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now you're getting into bright material oh you mean this is the kind of faith is made up of bright material that he could cut the bride from yes may they shake you up not just sitting on woman Church bench coming no no you interested in the things of God you're interested in getting Revelation this is bright material now where he could leave the storm and give you peace bright material when he can lead the affection and give your grace right material when he can leave the hate and give you love bright material Oh Glory to God and God could do whatever he wants and say the Lord Give the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord God know what he is doing and they commit your future into his hands he let go of anxiety you let go of disappointments you let go of things they don't understand there are some things in your life there's no explanation for and God will have to give an explanation one time brother Brown and pray for somebody and afterwards I think the drunk or they die or something like that the dry and then God showed him that she was supposed to go some way long time before and God extended the light to that hour and was a time to go when the Grim Reaper come the Grim Reaper come you come to take somebody home you come take somebody home you have to know your heart is to leave this place you must have a Wonder Woman people do it about that as a mystery Veil there step in next Dimension and they're gone and they leave you to wonder and get greedy Hallelujah but there's a real world he's not a god of the Dead He's the god of the living all I'm saying is going on they're still alive they listen they don't have this physical body what we know them to be in but they live in their life oh but they're going to be her people who are alive and remain unto the common of the Lord I want to be one of them I hope you are one of them oh glory to God hallelujah here we go when a man lives by faith and walks by feet not live by church or live by Pastor or live by this inspirational group live by faith that's personal faith is always personal fear is a revelation from God Peter alone had it and he said the word Peter and upon his Rock I'll build my church so faith can be shared oh give the Lord a shout in the house do you get it out faith can be shared fear to the Revelation and you who get it have it hey hey you get it have it [Applause] [Music] look what Peter said put a man the said Van Gogh Have I None such as we have no he was talking for nobody he said I have I give it I have it I can give it I can have it if I don't have it I can't give it I give what I have he said rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ spoken word power at his feet Glory this is good when a man lives by faith are you living by faith or flesh you argue because you're in the flesh you argue because you're not seeing God and you feel you have to make a point when you make a point it's like a win take win that's the name when they want to make a point they say but take away and take with you you win they want to argument that people like arguments you know is a congresswoman she said she has to get through this appointment so people call and complimenter for what the what she's doing she says she's looking for somebody who again started to criticize you looking for she's looking for a fight there's some people just contrary you say hey they said be this is just going opposite direction just to be different cut that out try to get that agreeable spirit try to work with God that will give you a new spiritual to give you something to work with the Holy Spirit bad spirited people in church like people in church and like church folks all right let's go when I'm unless by faith and walk by faith I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becoming the recruiter in Christ there now you are getting into bright material see see you are getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us here we go not just the pastor the deacons the trustees that means the laity every individual walks in a world where God Alone you are baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God could we get there could we as individuals get to a place where you and God Alone doesn't matter what sisters will say Brothers one say what preachers say what pastors say it matters what God's saying you and God in a cocoon wrap up here now hope you're not tired before the astronauts leave here before they take off on those please in space is weightlessness there's no gravity up there so when they have to drink something you see them doing so and they drink floating from them and a whole drink and pull it so that's how they go you walk in prison don't walk brisking yeah you know when you're walking you're walking so it's weightlessness so when somebody send a cup to you the cup floating same speed I see the cop coming towards you the copy hustling you know and you had to reach up your hands too and get it up soon bring it to zero gravity no you don't send a man up there who never experienced that you have to have create that zero gravity on Earth and they get a training to understand how to pick up things put away things handle things and move and they have to live in that environment because up there is like that of their different are you with me if there's a Rapture and we know there is it has to be an environment of training that we can walk with a substance Faith live with the substant faith knowing that we're going to believe in here you know what he says the resurrected Saints will appear to those who live in and you're gonna know who they are [Applause] in the Bible the sleeping sense arose and appear to many so they hurt our people from Among Us who have left that when they come you know it's time up you know what's happening they didn't appear to the public you know they appear to be elected or give the Lord a praise offering glory to God give the Lord a shout they are going to appear [Applause] what that means for the laity every individual walks in the world but God alone you are baptized into this Kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God see he give the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shattered out nowhere you walk right in if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on do the same now you are coming into perfect fit his perfect Perfection that cannot feel my God that faith never fails he was a Mystic to them with his Perfect Fit And so there's no way those who are perfect will you miss it to others notice now perfect Faith Masters is a must of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is if in a room of sickness the Lord revealed this is going to happen you just speak it and go on you don't ask questions it's already over faith believes God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he will do it anyhow it's a master of all circumstances so when Jesus said I thank God I was not there Lazarus is dead he said no he's sleeping I go to weak him I thank God I am not there when he is going now every every Everybody crying and weeping Lord if he hadn't been here my brother not die but even now three men are gay master of all circumstances he wept they were weeping he cried with them and then he tell them where have you laid him something still in his spirit because faith is activated in our sister who want to believe God for all things he said even now even now that even now George is in a girl that even now activates something in Jesus I am the resurrection and the light he's a believer in me though he were dead yet shall he live Oh Glory to God something is about to move then then the final straw is roll away the stone oh a little woman and I could roll away the stone here because she have faith she have confidence in the master she run to that stone whatever strength she had they had to push praise God hallelujah and roll away the stone and the stone roll away Lazarus come forward and a dead man coming with dead clothes dead clothes on as Isaac say come and jump in so yeah yeah halluciate he just wrap up say that claw jump in you tap inside the cloth you come on jumping on your own loose him and let him go just loose him and let them go sometimes God take you out they don't even know because you're still wrap up wrap up at this and wrap up with that but we gonna lose it today unwrap here today take that dead God off for you today oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank you Lord let me see him skip come on please wow Hallelujah why don't you get this in here boy foolish versions no oil wise virgin oil all represent holy spirit is not right praise God now watch we find that oil and wine is connected together in worship Hallelujah always connected in worship the wine is what symbolized it was the power of stimulation by Revelation so real Revelation brings stimulation and the reason people are dead today they have no stimulation because they lack Revelation and Revelation the Holy Spirit revealing to you the word they go in the Holy Spirit revealed to you and get excited make you want to run and make I want to jump and make me want to holler because it's revealed to you and wine bring a stimulation and the same way natural mind give us stimulation spiritual wine give us stimulation also isn't that right Oh Glory to God and when something is revealed it gives stimulation to the believer nothing revealed the video yesterday and watch a hearing I hate but when I review to you forget it they want to smile you want to hit your neighbor high five praise don't want to punk somebody praise God because what it bring us stimulation because Revelation isn't right Hallelujah and that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to believer because it is presented by revelation it is seems something that God said remember if the truth is revealed the truth is also Vindicated my God here we go now the power of Revelation the power of brings stimulation to the
