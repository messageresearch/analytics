[56:50] and see where God take you through so
[56:51] many things. And we still question him.
[56:55] We still doubt it. And God has shown you
[56:58] in past experiences where he took it
[57:00] through this. He took it through that.
[57:02] And he can't fail. Amen. And everyone is
[57:05] a test. He took it through the beer. He
[57:07] took it through the lion. Golat going to

[57:14] Why be worried? Get get to say, "Lord, I
[57:17] laid at your feet." You have family
[57:19] problems, husband problem, wife problem,
[57:20] children problem, money problem,
[57:22] whatever problem, we have to be able to
[57:25] leave it at his feet. Amen. Amen. He
[57:28] will take care of his own people. Amen.
[57:31] So this is a beautiful morning, a lovely
[57:33] day, a lovely atmosphere.
[57:36] Amen. Very, very
[57:39] inspiring. So this morning um two
[57:41] portion of scripture to read Jeremiah
[57:42] chapter 32 reading from 6 to 14 as we
[57:46] stand. Revelation 5 want to read uh
[57:49] verse 1 to
[57:52] 10. You good here this morning? Want to
[57:56] Leave that burden gone by the riverside.
[58:04] All right. Revelation uh Jeremiah
[58:06] chapter
[58:07] 32 reading from verse
[58:10] 6. See what we have.
[58:13] And Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord
[58:14] came unto me, saying, Behold, Han, the
[58:19] son of Shalom, thine uncle, shall come
[58:22] unto thee, saying, by thee my field that
[58:25] is in
[58:27] Anath, for the right of redemption is
[58:29] thine to buy
[58:31] it." So Hannal, my uncle's son, so so in
[58:35] other words, God gave him a word what's
[58:36] about to take place. So here come the
[58:38] fulfillment. So hanim my uncle's son
[58:41] came to me in the court of the prison
[58:45] according to the word of the lord and
[58:47] said unto me by my field I pray thee
[58:51] that is anthos which is in the country
[58:54] of Benjamin for the right of inheritance
[58:57] is thine and the redemption is thine buy
[59:01] it for
[59:03] thyself. Then I knew that this was the
[59:06] word of the
[59:07] Lord. And I bought the field of
[59:10] Hanal, my uncle's son, that was in
[59:14] Anatha, and weighed him the money, even
[59:18] 17 shekels of
[59:19] silver. And I subscribed the evidence
[59:23] and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
[59:27] weighed him the money in the balances.
[59:30] So I took the evidence of the purchase,
[59:34] both that which was sealed, according to
[59:37] the law and custom, and that which was
[59:40] open.
[59:41] And I give the evidence of the purchase
[59:45] unto Barack, the son of Niah, the son of
[59:49] Basil, in the sight of Hanil, my uncle's
[59:52] son, and in the presence of the
[59:54] witnesses that purchased the book of the
[59:57] purchase. I subscribed to the book of
[1:00:00] purchase before all the Jews that sat in
[1:00:04] the court of the prison. And we want to
[1:00:08] let's and I charged Barack before him
[1:00:10] saying thus sayeth the Lord of host the
[1:00:14] God of Israel. Take these
[1:00:18] evidences this evidence of the purchase
[1:00:21] both which is sealed and this evidence
[1:00:24] which is open and put them in the
[1:00:28] vessels that they may continue many
[1:00:31] days. Reading Revelation 10 or
[1:00:35] Revelation chapter 5 rather reading from
[1:00:37] verse one. I saw in the right hand of
[1:00:38] him that sat on the throne a book
[1:00:40] written within the backside sea with
[1:00:43] seven seas. And I saw a strong angel
[1:00:45] proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy
[1:00:47] to open the book and to loose the seas
[1:00:49] thereof. No man in heaven nor in earth
[1:00:52] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:00:54] the book, neither to look therein. And I
[1:00:56] wept much because no one was found
[1:00:59] worthy to open and to read the book.
[1:01:01] needed to look therein. And one of the
[1:01:02] elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold,
[1:01:05] the land of the tribe of Judah, root of
[1:01:07] David had prevailed, to open the book,
[1:01:10] and to loose the seven seeds thereof.
[1:01:11] And beheld, and I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:01:14] midst of the throne of the four beasts,
[1:01:16] in the midst of the elders to the lamb,
[1:01:18] as it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:01:21] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:01:23] spirits of God, sent forth into all the
[1:01:25] earth. And he came and took the book out
[1:01:27] of the right hand of him that sat upon a
[1:01:30] throne. And when he had taken the book,
[1:01:32] the four beasts and four and 20 elders
[1:01:35] fell down before the lamb, having every
[1:01:37] one of them hops and golden vials full
[1:01:39] of orders which are the prayers of the
[1:01:41] saints. And they saw a new song, saying,
[1:01:43] "Thou art worthy to take the book, and
[1:01:44] to open the seals thereof, for thou was
[1:01:46] slain, and has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:01:49] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:01:51] and people and nation, and has made unto
[1:01:53] us our God kings and priests, has made
[1:01:56] us unto our God kings and priests, and
[1:01:58] we shall reign on the earth. Let's bore
[1:01:59] his." Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[1:02:01] your word tonight, and we thank you for
[1:02:02] your spirit as here. May you take me out
[1:02:05] of the way and speak to your people and
[1:02:07] may you confirm your word with a mighty
[1:02:09] outpoint of your spirit with signs,
[1:02:10] wonders and miracles. I ask in Jesus
[1:02:12] name. Amen. You may be seated. Oh,
[1:02:14] praise God. Your life is not in vain.
[1:02:18] Your life have a great divine purpose
[1:02:20] behind it. You have to be interested and
[1:02:22] find out what is the purpose of your
[1:02:24] life. Whatever stage of life you're in
[1:02:26] right now, there's a plan for God in fit
[1:02:28] for that. Whether you're 17, whether
[1:02:30] you're six, whether you're 100, it
[1:02:32] doesn't matter what age you at. There's
[1:02:33] a purpose of God why you're here. And it
[1:02:36] is your responsibility to say, Lord,
[1:02:38] what is my purpose? What is what is the
[1:02:40] reason for being here? Praise God. Have
[1:02:43] a thought this morning. Evidence of
[1:02:45] purchase. That's the thought that I
[1:02:47] have. Evidence of purchase. And you read
[1:02:52] where God told Jeremiah his uncle will
[1:02:55] come and tell him buy the land. And he
[1:02:58] said, "Take the land, buy it, pay for
[1:02:59] it." And this evidence of purchase is a
[1:03:02] visible, tangible, verifiable proof that
[1:03:07] a transaction has occurred and that
[1:03:10] ownership rights have been changed.
[1:03:12] Rights have changed hands. So whenever a
[1:03:15] land is purchased, they have to go go to
[1:03:18] the person that purchased it. Is a
[1:03:20] change of hands, a change of ownership.
[1:03:22] And one time the devil had us. He
[1:03:24] thought he owned us. But Jesus came and
[1:03:27] paid the price and he died and paid for
[1:03:31] us that we a transfer of ownership. We
[1:03:34] no longer belong to the devil. We no
[1:03:37] longer belong to the world. We belong to
[1:03:39] God. Isn't that something? So therefore
[1:03:41] our lives should reflect that we have
[1:03:44] been purchased and we ourselves become
[1:03:47] evidence of purchase. Isn't that right?
[1:03:51] So in modern times this evidence is like
[1:03:54] a receipt and Jesus purchased with his
[1:03:56] blood and he's coming back to pay and
[1:03:59] receive what he has purchased for. Isn't
[1:04:02] that right? You know like when you go
[1:04:03] and buy furniture or buy something in a
[1:04:05] store to make a down payment or you pay
[1:04:06] the whole payment it hasn't been
[1:04:08] delivered yet but you have the receipt
[1:04:10] and that receipt that is written is
[1:04:12] tangible proof that a price has been
[1:04:14] paid. That receipt could be compared to
[1:04:16] the bus ticket. When you pay for the bus
[1:04:18] ticket, the ticket is the evidence. The
[1:04:20] price have been paid. That receipt can
[1:04:22] be compared with the token because the
[1:04:24] token is evidence. A lamb was slain and
[1:04:27] the blood is evidence. Praise God. That
[1:04:29] lamb was slain and you could present
[1:04:31] that token or you can present that to
[1:04:33] ticket or you can present the receipt.
[1:04:35] Isn't that right? Blessed be the name of
[1:04:36] the Lord. So we know that we have been
[1:04:39] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:41] Isn't that right? Amen. Amen. So 1
[1:04:44] Corinthians 6 says from 19, what know ye
[1:04:47] not that your body is the temple of the
[1:04:50] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:04:52] have of God? You are not your own for
[1:04:55] you are bought with a price. Therefore
[1:04:58] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:05:01] spirit which are gods. So we are not
[1:05:03] here just to live and just have a house
[1:05:05] and and living for money and living for
[1:05:08] house and car and and whatnot. We are
[1:05:10] here at brother again preach on
[1:05:11] Wednesday night for God's honor and
[1:05:12] God's glory. That's the primary thing.
[1:05:14] Amen. Whatever God bless you with is to
[1:05:17] glorify him. Hallelujah. Are you do you
[1:05:20] get that now? Whatever God give you is
[1:05:22] to bring glory back to God. It's not for
[1:05:25] you to selfishly hold it down and say I
[1:05:26] have this, I have that. No, it's to
[1:05:28] bring glory to God. There are too much
[1:05:30] people living selfish lives. Haven't God
[1:05:32] have no glory to get from that.
[1:05:33] Selfishness have nothing to do with God
[1:05:35] getting glory. Oh, praise the name of
[1:05:37] the Lord. You therefore glorify God in
[1:05:40] your body in your spirit which are God.
[1:05:42] Isn't that right? So therefore our lives
[1:05:45] become visible evidence of this
[1:05:47] purchase. Not
[1:05:50] invisible visible evidence of this
[1:05:52] purchase. Our lives must become visible
[1:05:55] to others. We cannot live an invisible
[1:05:58] private secret Christian life.
[1:06:01] I don't expect much amen for that but I
[1:06:04] will still say it. You cannot live a
[1:06:07] private invisible Christian life. A
[1:06:11] Christian life is a public life. Amen.
[1:06:13] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:06:16] That is why God tell them take a lamb,
[1:06:19] kill it. Take the blood and put it on
[1:06:22] the doorpost. Everybody passing should
[1:06:25] see it. You can't paint it on the
[1:06:27] inside. He said not when I come in the
[1:06:28] inside. I'm not coming inside to look
[1:06:30] for it. When I see the blood, it has to
[1:06:32] be on display. So you cannot look to
[1:06:35] live a private secret Christian life.
[1:06:38] You life have to become public. It have
[1:06:41] to become visible. It has to become
[1:06:43] evident. Yeah. One no and a private life
[1:06:47] and you in your own bubble. You have to
[1:06:48] come out. You have to bust that bubble.
[1:06:50] You have to come out your
[1:06:52] foolishness. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:06:54] praises. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:06:57] Hallelujah. when when who which was um
[1:07:00] Gideon who them guys was talking about
[1:07:02] who is who is fearful go back
[1:07:06] home who just who just get married go
[1:07:08] back
[1:07:09] home who hungry go back
[1:07:12] home what you looking for you're looking
[1:07:14] for people who ready to fight ready to
[1:07:17] stand ready to be witnesses God don't
[1:07:19] need a crowd you know but God need
[1:07:22] genuine people praise God praise God
[1:07:25] David said what what did David said you
[1:07:27] come with me and she spare, but I come
[1:07:28] to you in the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:30] What he's doing, he's glorifying God. I
[1:07:32] come to you in his name. Amen. Praise
[1:07:34] God. And I'm going to cut your head off.
[1:07:37] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:07:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:41] Hallelujah. So, we have to have visible
[1:07:45] evidence of purchase. Isn't that right?
[1:07:48] 2 Corinthians 3 2 3 says, "Ye are our
[1:07:52] epistle written in our hearts, known and
[1:07:55] read of all men. For as much as ye have
[1:07:58] manifested, declared to be the epistle
[1:07:59] of Christ, minister to us, written not
[1:08:02] with ink, but with the spirit of the
[1:08:04] living God, not in tables of stone, but
[1:08:07] in fleshly tables of the heart. That's
[1:08:09] the scripture, Brother. We are written
[1:08:12] epistles read of all men. That is, here
[1:08:14] we go. Your life read so loud to the
[1:08:18] public until your testimony. If it is
[1:08:22] contrary to your life, it's without any
[1:08:24] effect. It is what you are inside of
[1:08:28] you. Amen. That people read. Not so much
[1:08:32] what you see, but what you are. You can
[1:08:36] pin something on somebody and say this
[1:08:37] is that and so forth. But your life
[1:08:39] being different from what they say, your
[1:08:42] testimony, your life is louder than the
[1:08:44] testimony that someone could say
[1:08:45] something about you. So that just keep
[1:08:47] keep that in mind. We are bringing
[1:08:50] influences every day and the life that
[1:08:52] you live proves what's on the inside of
[1:08:55] you. You cannot change that. It reflects
[1:08:58] every person reflects outside what he
[1:09:00] has on the inside. Oh, give the Lord
[1:09:03] some praises tonight.
[1:09:06] Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] And if we take the testimony of being a
[1:09:09] Christian, I think that that is the most
[1:09:12] solemn thing that a man or woman, boy or
[1:09:14] girl could do when he takes on the name
[1:09:16] of Christ. That he's going to be a
[1:09:18] representative of Christ. You should
[1:09:20] watch every move you make because you
[1:09:23] why somebody is watching you.
[1:09:29] The risk is not worth it. That's right.
[1:09:35] Bible speak about the way of the
[1:09:37] transgressors is hard. You should talk
[1:09:39] to people who get backsliden and see
[1:09:40] what happened to them when they come to
[1:09:43] the Lord and the effect of their lives.
[1:09:45] And sometimes we have what you call
[1:09:47] unintended
[1:09:48] consequences of our words of our
[1:09:52] attitudes and of our actions.
[1:09:55] Now whether you jump or shouting it
[1:09:57] doesn't matter to me you know I have a
[1:09:58] word to deliver you know and I come here
[1:10:00] to deliver that you know
[1:10:03] I not come here to minister to how you
[1:10:05] feel and how you think you know I come
[1:10:07] here to minister because the spirit will
[1:10:09] pick up things
[1:10:12] people don't like that the spirit will
[1:10:14] pick up your spirit and the spirit will
[1:10:16] take you up by the word and minister to
[1:10:18] you to meet your very need because you
[1:10:21] just can't want to do your own thing and
[1:10:24] you'll find Not why
[1:10:26] remember you are living written pisses
[1:10:27] rid of all men. Now people many people
[1:10:29] won't read the Bible
[1:10:32] but God has made
[1:10:34] you a living representative. Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] You are a walking letter.
[1:10:41] You should be a walking Bible.
[1:10:44] Christ in you should be the walking word
[1:10:48] of God. Amen. Amen. And if you profess
[1:10:50] to be a Christian, your influence, what
[1:10:53] you are influencing will have to have an
[1:10:54] answer of many souls that you have
[1:10:56] turned aside from Christ.
[1:10:59] So people are Christian and you letting
[1:11:01] unbelievers lead you.
[1:11:04] And I know unbelievers leading you
[1:11:06] because you're not leading them. If you
[1:11:08] was leading them, you bring them to
[1:11:09] church. Them friends you have out there,
[1:11:11] the partners. Amen. How come we see your
[1:11:14] partners in church? Hallelujah. How come
[1:11:17] we see your friends in church? That mean
[1:11:19] they have more influence over you.
[1:11:20] They're leaving you out of church. Amen.
[1:11:22] But if you a leader under God, you know
[1:11:26] how to lead them because everything in
[1:11:28] life outside of serving Jesus Christ is
[1:11:31] waste of time.
[1:11:36] You have to leave back your car someday.
[1:11:37] That's right. What do you think from
[1:11:39] now? You live 100 120.
[1:11:45] Where you going with that? Amen.
[1:11:47] Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] Remember telling sister years ago said
[1:11:51] live for Christ and
[1:11:55] glorif you. That's right. Just think
[1:11:58] about that. You live with your child and
[1:12:01] my child. They get big and they go and
[1:12:03] they go away.
[1:12:07] I said live for Christ. How did say
[1:12:10] friend or no friend whether I maintain
[1:12:12] my family or not? Let me maintain
[1:12:15] Christ. Oh Lord is my prayer. Sink or
[1:12:18] drunk, friend on friend, let me maintain
[1:12:21] Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah. So you put Christ first.
[1:12:26] Yes. Honor him. Worship him. Glorify him
[1:12:31] and he going to work things out for you.
[1:12:33] He's going to make a way for you. He say
[1:12:36] I'll be an enemy to your enemy. Glory to
[1:12:39] send my angel before you. You hear that?
[1:12:42] They not so secret agent. You know there
[1:12:44] is God's angel going before you. He said
[1:12:47] I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[1:12:49] you. I'll be with you even in you. That
[1:12:53] is God talking. You know I will not
[1:12:55] leave you comfortless. I will come to
[1:12:58] you. Little while the world see me no
[1:13:00] more but you shall see me because I
[1:13:03] live. You shall live also. Who's
[1:13:05] speaking? That's God speaking. God can't
[1:13:08] lie. Man does lie but God can't lie. I
[1:13:11] am your healer. Okay, give the Lord a
[1:13:13] shout. I am your deliverer. The devil
[1:13:16] have your bong. I'm going to set you
[1:13:17] free. I'm going to free you from your
[1:13:20] past. I'm going to free you from your
[1:13:22] fears.
[1:13:24] Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody.
[1:13:26] Don't tell nobody. And get tire as as
[1:13:28] hell.
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:31] Hallelujah.
[1:13:35] Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] The birds seem to know better than
[1:13:40] humans.
[1:13:42] When a bird is weak and struggling, the
[1:13:44] other birds flying away to protect it
[1:13:47] because it doesn't have the strength of
[1:13:48] its wings to fly. So the others in the
[1:13:51] pack fly a certain way to keep that bird
[1:13:53] up. What the devil like is to take
[1:13:55] somebody aside and beat them. Put licks
[1:13:58] on you and your pride will kill you
[1:14:00] because you think nobody is going
[1:14:02] through. Nobody know what going through.
[1:14:03] Nobody calling me. Nobody fighting with
[1:14:05] me. I'm all alone and all back. You all
[1:14:07] alone. What is one devil fighting? Yes.
[1:14:10] Hallelujah. Did you ever clean classes
[1:14:12] with himself? You know, he toasting to
[1:14:15] himself, you know. He toast him because
[1:14:17] he have somebody go and cook. Yes.
[1:14:19] He's going to abuse and and and and and
[1:14:21] and break their spirit and let them fall
[1:14:24] in depression. Yes. And you keep them by
[1:14:25] yourself. Well, a private and you know a
[1:14:28] shy.
[1:14:30] Hallelujah. Stay shy.
[1:14:34] A private. Stay private. Devil will beat
[1:14:37] you privately. That's right. He will
[1:14:39] take you under shak.
[1:14:43] A weak stay weak. Hallelujah. What does
[1:14:47] the Bible say? Let the weak say I am
[1:14:49] strong. I am here. Tell me this morning.
[1:14:51] The weak say I am strong. There's a
[1:14:54] reason the Bible say you have to say
[1:14:55] that because the devil will anoint you
[1:14:58] with weak. Can't make it. Are young. All
[1:15:02] the lights out there. Bright lights.
[1:15:03] Bright lights kill you know. That's
[1:15:05] right. People leave trainer going on
[1:15:06] America and forget it. The lights kill
[1:15:08] them. That's
[1:15:16] right. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] So you cannot expect a one to be a
[1:15:22] private me family and a nobody know.
[1:15:26] Devil ramp inside you. Devil living
[1:15:27] inside your house and you don't want
[1:15:29] nobody know. He building ceiling. He
[1:15:31] building roof. He go attic.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah. He improving the house
[1:15:36] because he want to live comfortable and
[1:15:38] you don't want nobody to know. Don't
[1:15:40] don't tell the ministry. Don't don't
[1:15:42] tell the ministry.
[1:15:44] Devil ch you're tearing out and pulling
[1:15:46] them to hell. Don't tell the ministry.
[1:15:48] Don't tell the ministry. They're on
[1:15:48] their way to hell. Don't tell the
[1:15:50] ministry.
[1:15:54] So there's a joke. We a comedy show.
[1:15:56] Then we just hear come to laugh and what
[1:15:59] entertainment.
[1:16:03] When Jesus came to the temple, he found
[1:16:05] the place where is written, the spirit
[1:16:07] is upon me. What for? For he had
[1:16:10] anointed me to do what? Set the captive
[1:16:13] free. Open the binding hands.
[1:16:17] Set at liberty them that are bound
[1:16:19] because we were born in sin. We were
[1:16:21] born in sin. Shame and iniquity. We have
[1:16:23] a chance. We don't have a opportunity to
[1:16:25] break out except grace come to us. And
[1:16:28] grace came to us in the person of Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ. That is why we're here this
[1:16:32] morning. Not because we righteous or we
[1:16:34] holy or we pure. Is because grace came
[1:16:36] to us in the person of Jesus Christ. And
[1:16:39] that is why we in service this morning.
[1:16:40] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:46] Hallelujah. It's a sad thing because
[1:16:47] some parents feel they can fix it. I
[1:16:50] come like a sister one time telling Anry
[1:16:52] she want Amry to talk to her daughter
[1:16:53] but she want to tell Anry what to tell
[1:16:55] her daughter. Well when you tell she
[1:16:58] yourself that's the amount of control
[1:17:00] they want to wait talk to my daughter
[1:17:03] and tell she this does she that touch.
[1:17:06] That's how it just
[1:17:07] work. Talk to you. That's right.
[1:17:10] Hallelujah. That's not how this work.
[1:17:13] But what they want is control. I don't
[1:17:15] want to do this. If you do this, I would
[1:17:17] tell the pastor because you want
[1:17:19] control. Control. Control. Manipulative
[1:17:22] control. God hates that because them
[1:17:25] little one mommy nice child. Rocking arm
[1:17:28] them little babies. Them babies. Big man
[1:17:30] in baby form. That's right. Big woman in
[1:17:32] baby form. You don't see them as big men
[1:17:33] yet. Yes. Because they are babies. But
[1:17:36] one day they're going to grow. They be
[1:17:38] taller than you. men and women on the
[1:17:40] earth.
[1:17:42] That's what God loves. He want to see a
[1:17:45] reproduction of the original green. God
[1:17:47] loves the day of Pentecost back to sons
[1:17:50] and daughters of God again. The whole
[1:17:52] creation has grown in for men to come to
[1:17:53] maturity. When I was a child, I spake
[1:17:56] like a child. I want to like a child. I
[1:17:57] can't be adopted as a child. But when I
[1:17:59] become a man, I have to put away
[1:18:00] childish things. There are certain
[1:18:01] things you have to put away. God is not
[1:18:03] going to put them away for you. You have
[1:18:05] to put them away. I'm not hearing it
[1:18:07] this morning. Amen. And I want to hear
[1:18:09] this morning, there are certain things
[1:18:11] you have to put away. You have to decide
[1:18:13] to act on what is bothering you and what
[1:18:16] is troubling you and what is affecting
[1:18:17] you. Do something about it.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:28] Brother say you are written epistles. I
[1:18:30] translate that. Turn it around. You are
[1:18:32] epistles that have been written because
[1:18:34] you can't add nothing to it. that is
[1:18:36] read of all men, manifested word of God.
[1:18:39] And Peter and John to show it, they went
[1:18:41] up there. They perceived they were
[1:18:43] ignorant and unlearned. They had no
[1:18:45] education, but had taken notice that
[1:18:47] they were with Jesus. They were ignorant
[1:18:49] and learned, but they were written
[1:18:50] epistles. See, read that they had been
[1:18:53] with Jesus because Jesus, here we go,
[1:18:55] was manifested himself through them.
[1:18:57] Amen. Christ veiled in their flesh.
[1:19:01] Amen. Manifested, made alive like it was
[1:19:04] in Moses. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] So we have to be living evidence of
[1:19:09] purchase. Amen. So you can't be a
[1:19:10] Christian here and
[1:19:12] then you're playing mass outside
[1:19:15] tomorrow.
[1:19:16] You're a Christian on Sunday but
[1:19:17] tomorrow next day Monday you you know
[1:19:20] what you are.
[1:19:23] All right let's go. Let's go Bible. Now
[1:19:29] we know what happened in the garden of
[1:19:30] Eden. God put Adam and Eve. He said
[1:19:34] multiply, replenish the earth and a
[1:19:36] further revelation they were supposed to
[1:19:38] wait on to do that. God did not give
[1:19:41] them that revelation yet because God
[1:19:43] don't release all the revelations. God
[1:19:46] is unfold as you walk.
[1:19:49] Do you get that? God will give you a
[1:19:51] binoculars or a whole torch light from
[1:19:53] here to the destination. It doesn't
[1:19:55] work. So you are to walk and as you walk
[1:19:58] with this lamp of the light of the word,
[1:20:01] more begin to unfold. Amen. Your walk of
[1:20:03] faith opens up things to you. When you
[1:20:06] don't walk, you don't see what you're
[1:20:08] supposed to see. You can't stand still.
[1:20:11] Every place you put your foot is yours.
[1:20:13] So God expect action. God expect drama
[1:20:16] because the land he gives you have
[1:20:18] hittes, Jebusites, Philistines, all kind
[1:20:19] of ice on it. But it's your land. And
[1:20:22] God give it to you. It's deed to you. He
[1:20:26] hand it to you. He said this is yours.
[1:20:28] The only thing is you have to fight for
[1:20:30] it. Go give the Lord some praises.
[1:20:32] Praise God. Don't be like the message
[1:20:34] people entitled to it. Feel you're
[1:20:36] entitled to it. You entitled to You're
[1:20:37] entitled to fight for what you know is
[1:20:40] your own. This word is to convince you.
[1:20:42] This is yours. This is not I trying to
[1:20:45] play games with your mind. This is
[1:20:47] yours. God sent a prophet and he brought
[1:20:49] spirit given words or spirit spoken
[1:20:51] words. That's why we say what the tape
[1:20:53] say that you will know what came out the
[1:20:55] mouth of God through this prophet. And
[1:20:57] when you hear it and you receive it,
[1:20:59] when you hear it and you act on it, when
[1:21:01] you hear it and it bring it to your
[1:21:02] heart, it is yours. No devil could take
[1:21:05] that from you. Jesus told Peter, upon
[1:21:08] this rock, I will build my church and
[1:21:10] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:21:11] it. Don't tell me no devil prevailing
[1:21:14] against you. You have no revelation.
[1:21:15] Said, ask God for
[1:21:19] revelation.
[1:21:23] Listen that revelation make will make
[1:21:25] you stand anyway anytime anybody's under
[1:21:27] any condition. That revelation make
[1:21:29] Abraham stand for 25 years without a
[1:21:31] child. Hallelujah. That revelation make
[1:21:33] David say I'll cut your head off. That
[1:21:35] revelation make Samson say once more
[1:21:36] Lord expecting power to come down.
[1:21:39] Revelation is something completely
[1:21:40] different. Re revelation make it
[1:21:42] radical. Revelation have no excuses.
[1:21:44] Revelation don't talk about a week and I
[1:21:46] can't make it and I'm struggling.
[1:21:48] Revelation never talk like that.
[1:21:50] Revelation say, "If the Lord be with me,
[1:21:52] I shall be able to drive them out."
[1:21:54] Revelation said, "Let us go up at once
[1:21:56] and possess this land for we are well
[1:21:58] able to take it." I'm not hearing you
[1:22:00] this morning. Amen. Let's turn on
[1:22:02] Tabernac. I'm not hearing you. Amen.
[1:22:04] Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] Revelation will say, "My child will be
[1:22:09] delivered. My daughter will be
[1:22:11] delivered. My husband will be delivered.
[1:22:14] I am going to be delivered. The church
[1:22:16] is going to be delivered. The B going to
[1:22:18] be delivered. Oh, glory to God.
[1:22:19] Revelation make your act completely
[1:22:21] different.
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:37] So we read the scripture of Jeremiah to
[1:22:40] purchase the land. He asked for free,
[1:22:42] you know. I asked for land donation.
[1:22:45] It's to purchase it. Amen. He got the
[1:22:47] silver. He got the andw weigh it in the
[1:22:50] presence of witnesses. It's not a
[1:22:52] private thing. You know, you must people
[1:22:54] know I purchase it. And how much you
[1:22:57] purchase it for and have the evidence of
[1:22:59] purchase? Legal title.
[1:23:05] Amen. So this book that Adam had let's
[1:23:10] get down now.
[1:23:12] Adam must have called names. Your name.
[1:23:15] Amen. our name. Adam had the book and
[1:23:19] out of that book he was to speak for
[1:23:20] you. But because he fell, it fell into
[1:23:23] sex. That's why we in this condition
[1:23:25] right now.
[1:23:27] Hallelujah. But Jesus when when Adam
[1:23:31] lost the book, the devil looking to
[1:23:32] catch looking looking for D, looking for
[1:23:34] something to hold on to. He's a
[1:23:35] squatter. Remember he get boots out of
[1:23:37] heaven. Land of the devil and earth of
[1:23:39] the devil and no boots and come down on
[1:23:41] the earth. So this earth don't belong to
[1:23:44] no devil. He end up on the earth but it
[1:23:47] doesn't belong to him. It belongs to us.
[1:23:49] God prepared a place in the garden of
[1:23:51] Eden for the sons and daughters of God.
[1:23:53] It was prepared for us.
[1:23:58] Hallelujah. But because man fell it have
[1:24:01] the condition we in. Amen. So the book
[1:24:04] of deed or title or evidence that he had
[1:24:07] he lost it and it went back into the
[1:24:10] hands of the original owner. Amen. Oh,
[1:24:12] God himself holding that book. And that
[1:24:14] book was sealed with seven seals because
[1:24:17] Paul let can't let the devil see what's
[1:24:18] inside that book. He mustn't photocopy
[1:24:20] it. He can't look on it. He doesn't know
[1:24:22] what is sealed in it. He doesn't have
[1:24:24] the evidence of it. So God himself held
[1:24:26] that book. Oh, glory to God. Adam
[1:24:29] couldn't get it because Adam needed
[1:24:30] redemption himself. Oh, glory. Adam
[1:24:33] couldn't take the book. God cut Adam
[1:24:35] from the tree of life. But we had to get
[1:24:38] back because once a son, always a son.
[1:24:40] Amen. We have to get back into sunship.
[1:24:42] We have to get back into courtship. We
[1:24:44] have to get back to inheritance. And the
[1:24:46] only way to get it back is by that book
[1:24:48] because we have to have the evidence.
[1:24:50] Okay. The Lord has shouted the house.
[1:24:52] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So listen to
[1:24:58] this. Revelation 5. One sat on the
[1:25:00] throne with a book open. A book sealed
[1:25:02] rather with seven seals. Who is worthy
[1:25:04] to take the book? Who is worthy to take
[1:25:06] the book? Wait, what? Which man is
[1:25:08] worthy? Let a man move. Let a man move.
[1:25:12] Because the pope wasn't worthy. Them
[1:25:14] special pastor, apostle, prophet,
[1:25:16] teacher who is message pope them was not
[1:25:17] worthy. Let a man was worthy. All of a
[1:25:20] sudden the lamb, bloody bleeding lamb.
[1:25:23] Oh God, we could close off right here.
[1:25:25] That bloody bleeding lamb step forward.
[1:25:28] Now you know what Jesus died for. He had
[1:25:30] just died for your sins. He died to get
[1:25:32] the book. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:25:35] Give the Lord a shout in the house. He
[1:25:37] had just died on the cross to die for
[1:25:39] your sins. He died to get that book.
[1:25:42] That book had a price. Oh, give the Lord
[1:25:44] a shout. That book had a price. It was a
[1:25:47] blood price. You had to pay it with his
[1:25:50] blood.
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:25:57] Therefore, I have a right to reject your
[1:25:59] deadness. To reject your deadness. When
[1:26:02] you understand this salvation we're
[1:26:04] talking about, it was paid with a heavy
[1:26:06] price. He died at Calvary. Oh, pay the
[1:26:09] price of his own blood to go and get
[1:26:11] that book to loose the names to call you
[1:26:14] in his last day. And you want to sit
[1:26:16] still. No message. People tell them for
[1:26:19] nothing. They are liars. There believe
[1:26:21] no message because when the lamb took
[1:26:23] the book John said all in heaven all
[1:26:25] under the earth. Third I John praise God
[1:26:28] he is worthy to take the book and to
[1:26:30] loose the seals thereof. Those seeds was
[1:26:33] knowledge. Glory to God. Those seeds was
[1:26:36] names. I'm not hearing you. I'm not
[1:26:39] hearing you. On the seat was names.
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:47] Hallelujah.
[1:26:53] Let me say it. Good for you. You can't
[1:26:55] change your past, but God hold the
[1:26:58] mystery of your future. Give the Lord
[1:27:00] some praises. The devil don't hold your
[1:27:02] future. You
[1:27:04] know, God does.
[1:27:10] Your future is not defined by what your
[1:27:12] wife say. Your future is not defined by
[1:27:14] what your husband say or your mother or
[1:27:16] your father say. Your future is not
[1:27:17] defined by what pastor say. Your future
[1:27:20] is defined by what God say. And God
[1:27:22] can't lie. Oh give the Lord a shout. No
[1:27:25] aunt, no mother-in-law, brother-in-law,
[1:27:28] son-in-law, no kind of law could define
[1:27:30] what your future is. Outlaw and all. Oh
[1:27:33] give the Lord a shout in the pray.
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:38] Hallelujah. Lord amen. I tell look to
[1:27:41] the minister association to define who I
[1:27:42] am. I tell somebody in a New York or
[1:27:45] America or somewhere in England
[1:27:46] somewhere or South America or Africa to
[1:27:48] define who I am. They crazy or what?
[1:27:53] Amen. God himself. Amen. Is who called
[1:27:56] you. Amen. No man can come except Yes,
[1:28:00] Lord.
[1:28:03] Your mother bring you, but your mother
[1:28:05] didn't call you. It's God that called
[1:28:07] you. Your father bring you, but your
[1:28:09] father didn't call you. It's God that
[1:28:10] called you. Somebody brought you to the
[1:28:12] building, but God had to speak to your
[1:28:14] heart. And when God speak to your heart,
[1:28:15] nobody can take that out. That God talk
[1:28:18] to you. Glory to God. Glory. When God
[1:28:21] talk to you, no man can cancel that.
[1:28:23] That cannot be cancelled. Who he found
[1:28:25] you, he called. Who he called, he
[1:28:27] justified. Who he justified, he already
[1:28:29] glorified. Oh God, I'm inspired this
[1:28:32] morning. The anointing is in this
[1:28:33] building this morning. We going to rock
[1:28:35] until we rock that devil right out. Give
[1:28:38] the Lord a shout. I'm looking for a
[1:28:40] mighty blast of the Holy Ghost this
[1:28:42] morning. I'm looking for a mighty
[1:28:43] outpouring of the spirit this morning.
[1:28:45] It's the old time Holy Spirit and the
[1:28:47] devil won't go near it. That's the
[1:28:49] reason the people in the message fear
[1:28:51] it. But it's good enough for me. Give
[1:28:54] the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:29:02] Glory.
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:17] Brother, now the forfeited title deed is
[1:29:20] now in the hands of the original owner,
[1:29:23] Almighty God. The title deed to the
[1:29:26] earth and to eternal life. When Adam
[1:29:30] forfeited it, Satan's dirty hands could
[1:29:33] not take it. So it went back to its
[1:29:36] original owner, God himself.
[1:29:40] When Adam forfeited it for wisdom
[1:29:42] instead of faith, that's the problem
[1:29:44] message right now. Full of wisdom
[1:29:48] instead of faith. It went back into the
[1:29:50] hands of the owner, almighty God,
[1:29:54] waiting.
[1:29:58] What is doing in the hands of God,
[1:30:00] waiting for redemption claims. Amen. Now
[1:30:04] watch these words. These words are very
[1:30:05] important.
[1:30:07] Waiting for what? That's why the voice
[1:30:09] said, "Who is worthy to take the book?"
[1:30:14] And the lamb came. I said, "Excuse me,
[1:30:17] class."
[1:30:23] He came and took the book.
[1:30:30] Now you see the lamb took the book.
[1:30:32] Let's go to version 10. And the voice
[1:30:34] said 8, go to the angel and clear your
[1:30:38] throat
[1:30:41] and ask for the book.
[1:30:43] Give me the book. And I took the book
[1:30:45] and did what? Eat the book.
[1:30:51] Not chew the book. They're not chewing
[1:30:52] gum. We chew after spit it out the
[1:30:56] service to
[1:31:01] you chew him
[1:31:03] when I know what John did. You know he
[1:31:06] eat the book he say sweet in the mouth.
[1:31:09] That's oh my. But in the belly when you
[1:31:12] have to stand for something when you
[1:31:14] have to tell your family and friends
[1:31:15] this is the word. When you have to tell
[1:31:16] your family you need a revival. When you
[1:31:18] have to tell your family you have to
[1:31:19] repent and get things right. When you
[1:31:21] have to talk to your sons. When you have
[1:31:22] to talk to your daughters, it's bitter,
[1:31:24] but you got to do it. It's sweet in the
[1:31:26] mouth. It's bitter in the belly, but you
[1:31:27] got to stand. You got to speak. You got
[1:31:29] to live. You got to act. You got to do.
[1:31:31] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:42] He made a way for
[1:31:43] redemption. He made a way for back and
[1:31:46] someday redemption to take it. Waiting
[1:31:48] for redemption claim. It's redemption.
[1:31:50] What is this book of redemption? This
[1:31:53] title deed, this abstract title deed,
[1:31:56] its redemption means here what it means.
[1:31:57] Here what it means. All legal possession
[1:32:02] to all that was lost by Adam and Eve. It
[1:32:05] is legal possession to the abstract
[1:32:07] deed, title deed, eternal life means
[1:32:09] that you
[1:32:11] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:32:13] lost. Amen. I want to take this tonight
[1:32:16] and walk out with it. He is saying to me
[1:32:19] that this book means that you and I
[1:32:24] possess everything that Adam lost.
[1:32:34] Now I know some of you not saying amen.
[1:32:35] Some of you have seen Abraham half. Some
[1:32:37] of you wondering if you're still saying
[1:32:38] amen. Hallelujah. Because you can say
[1:32:40] you hand nothing and you possess
[1:32:41] nothing. But that doesn't matter. Amen.
[1:32:44] You could be a drunkard. You could be a
[1:32:47] prostitute. You could be a drinker, a
[1:32:48] smoker, ganja, taking drugs, and your
[1:32:51] uncle or some family member leaves some
[1:32:53] property or land for you. Yes. That have
[1:32:55] nothing to do with what you are. Yes.
[1:32:57] You could be a drunker, you're drunk,
[1:32:58] and you're staggering your street there
[1:33:01] and walk and somebody say, "Wake up.
[1:33:02] Hey, wake up, boy.
[1:33:05] Uncle Pastor and leave a deed and
[1:33:07] de when I get sober, come back and
[1:33:11] talk."
[1:33:12] When you get out your booze head and
[1:33:14] they get sober and they explain to you
[1:33:16] your uncle leave five acres here, 10
[1:33:18] acres here, a house here. They say
[1:33:21] really what my brother he's a better man
[1:33:24] than me and he don't drink at all.
[1:33:27] You hear that your brother, but he
[1:33:28] didn't leave it for him.
[1:33:30] Your name is on the deed. Your name is
[1:33:32] on the document. And I'm a lawyer. We
[1:33:35] come to tell you what your uncle leave
[1:33:36] for you. Now you could sit down there
[1:33:38] and play foolish and do like if that
[1:33:40] doesn't spoke to you. Or you could sit
[1:33:42] there and say, "But listen, let me clear
[1:33:43] ahead. Let me drink some coffee instead
[1:33:45] of booze and let me get on to business
[1:33:47] now. Let me see. Wait a sign." Yes. And
[1:33:50] afterwards, you get you went to you go
[1:33:52] to properties that is yours. It have
[1:33:54] nothing to do with you're not deserving.
[1:33:56] You're unworthy. Your drink have nothing
[1:33:58] to do with that. It have to do what your
[1:34:00] uncle leave back. Amen.
[1:34:02] Well, Jesus died. Pay the price. Amen.
[1:34:05] For us to get back all animal lost.
[1:34:07] Amen. Not only did he die, he came back
[1:34:10] as the enforcer. He came back as the
[1:34:13] Holy Ghost. He came back as the
[1:34:15] enforcing power that you could ensure to
[1:34:18] ensure you get what he died for. I don't
[1:34:21] want nothing less than that. Look at me
[1:34:24] spoke word book and said Jesus died for
[1:34:26] me to read that. Don't come with it. He
[1:34:29] died for something more than that. Oh,
[1:34:31] give the Lord a shout. He died that I
[1:34:34] could be healthy. He died that I could
[1:34:36] be free. He died that I could be healed.
[1:34:39] He died that I could be free.
[1:34:42] [Applause]
[1:34:44] And brother Stephven sang this morning.
[1:34:46] The Lord save me. Why should I be bound?
[1:34:49] I've been baptized in Jesus name. Why
[1:34:52] should I be bound? Oh, give the Lord a
[1:34:54] shout. Glory to God. Don't let your gray
[1:34:57] hair be in vain. Give the Lord some
[1:34:58] praises.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah. I don't understand when
[1:35:10] you're getting older like me. Got to
[1:35:13] stretch.
[1:35:14] Somebody tell me tell me stretch from
[1:35:17] the from on your bed. You start to
[1:35:18] stretch before you go just jump in the
[1:35:20] bed. Stretch in the bed. Stretch. Yeah.
[1:35:22] Well, you better stretch inside. Yes.
[1:35:24] Long time some you stretch. Your hands
[1:35:25] stick your hands stiff so long. Praise
[1:35:28] God. Your hands stiff. You better start
[1:35:29] to stretch. You know, start to fling
[1:35:31] your hand like that. Now these might get
[1:35:32] up. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Legs tight.
[1:35:36] Praise God. Your knees can't bend. But
[1:35:38] we have that too, you know. But start to
[1:35:40] stretch a little bit now. If you're
[1:35:41] sitting down, shake a little limb. Let
[1:35:43] the devil know you're toe active. When I
[1:35:45] get off now, I say, "Lord, thank you for
[1:35:46] the activity in my body." Oh, give the
[1:35:48] Lord some praises.
[1:36:00] Ask my wife when I wake up. So I said I
[1:36:02] said see like
[1:36:07] this. I take my time to straighten
[1:36:10] up slow motion. Yeah. You can't do that
[1:36:13] too fast. Some people can't bend. You
[1:36:15] can't watch careful because you sure
[1:36:18] you're getting back up now. Are you not
[1:36:19] getting back up in a hurry? You have to
[1:36:22] walk. You have to walk a certain way.
[1:36:25] Hallelujah.
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:29] So this redemption mean all legal
[1:36:31] possessions to all that was lost by Adam
[1:36:34] and Eve. You said what ought that do to
[1:36:36] a born again Christian. It is legal
[1:36:39] possession of the abstract deed title
[1:36:42] deed of eternal life means that you
[1:36:44] possess everything that I'm lost. The
[1:36:47] possession of that
[1:36:48] deed. Amen. So when Peter said, "Here we
[1:36:51] go. Silver and gold have I none." But I
[1:36:55] have plenty of books for me. Come to
[1:36:57] give you this evening.
[1:37:00] That was not Peter said. He said,
[1:37:02] "Silver and gold have I none. Such as I
[1:37:05] have." What did he have? What did he
[1:37:06] have? He had the deed. He had the
[1:37:08] evidence of purchase. He had the Holy
[1:37:10] Ghost itself. Such as I have. I have it.
[1:37:14] I could give it. If I have it, I could
[1:37:16] give it. I cannot give what I don't
[1:37:18] have. But because I have it, I can give
[1:37:20] it. Rise up and walk in the name of
[1:37:22] Jesus Christ. It was tangible. Oh, it
[1:37:26] was evidence. It was real. Oh, give the
[1:37:30] Lord a shout. You say, "Brother, Peter,
[1:37:33] but you deny Christ. What's your lying
[1:37:36] mouth? Who cares about that?" What? The
[1:37:39] Lord saved
[1:37:43] me. So
[1:37:47] you want to point Peter to his past.
[1:37:49] Peter, you did this, you did that. But
[1:37:50] God cancelled that.
[1:37:53] And the abstract wipe out all of that.
[1:37:55] Amen.
[1:37:57] Mary Magdalene, the one that he cast out
[1:37:59] seven devils from that was in the upper
[1:38:01] room. God cancelled everything, you
[1:38:03] know. She was full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:06] Hallelujah. Andrew, full of the Holy
[1:38:08] Ghost. Peter, full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:10] Phillip, full of the Holy Ghost. Give me
[1:38:13] a church full of the Holy Ghost. God
[1:38:15] will do in one year what all the
[1:38:17] theologians fail to do in 2,000 years.
[1:38:19] Give me a church in this message full of
[1:38:22] the Holy Ghost. It will shut the
[1:38:23] critics's mouth. Dynamics and mechanics
[1:38:26] together. The Holy Ghost riding the
[1:38:28] trail once more. The white horse rider.
[1:38:31] Oh, the Lord has shouting the house.
[1:38:33] Hallelujah.
[1:38:34] Hallelujah. There'll be one more ride. I
[1:38:37] believe that the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:38:38] have one more ride with healing in his
[1:38:40] wings with signs and wonders and
[1:38:42] miracles. Every gift back in the church,
[1:38:45] there'll be one more ride. No devil
[1:38:46] could stop that. I'm here to prophesy
[1:38:48] that. I'm here to speak that. Oh, give
[1:38:51] the Lord a shout in the house. The blind
[1:38:53] going to see. The deaf is going to hear.
[1:38:55] The dead is going to be raised up. And
[1:38:57] there'll be a seventh revival. Oh, give
[1:38:59] the Lord a shout in the house. Glory to
[1:39:02] God. I have a right to praise God this
[1:39:03] morning. is what living for
[1:39:11] glory.
[1:39:18] This is my heart's desire. I want to be
[1:39:20] an example seed son. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:24] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory. Let's continue.
[1:39:28] Adam could not meet the requirements of
[1:39:30] redemption after he found he lost it. He
[1:39:33] had sinned. He had separated himself
[1:39:35] from God and was on this side of the
[1:39:37] chasm and he could not redeem it. He
[1:39:39] couldn't do it because he needed
[1:39:41] redemption himself. So he couldn't do
[1:39:43] it. Amen. But the law, God's law,
[1:39:46] required a kinsman redeemer. The law of
[1:39:49] God required a kinsman redeemer. Amen.
[1:39:52] My God. My God. Not an angel to redeem.
[1:39:55] It must be one of us. One like us, a
[1:39:58] human being. Isn't that right? But God's
[1:40:01] law, watch, watch, receive a substitute.
[1:40:05] And if God had not offered to take a
[1:40:07] substitute, but hear this, love
[1:40:10] constrained him to do it. That man was
[1:40:13] without a way back. There was no way for
[1:40:15] him to get back. He was gone. But the
[1:40:18] grace of God met this kinsman redeemer
[1:40:21] in the person of Jesus Christ. God's law
[1:40:25] required an innocent substitute. And who
[1:40:27] was innocent? Every man that was born
[1:40:28] sexual after sex. everyone and the only
[1:40:31] one that wasn't had forfeited rights had
[1:40:33] to be the king of the earth. When I
[1:40:35] think of the scripture, thou has
[1:40:36] redeemed us back to God and we may reign
[1:40:38] as kings and priests. Notice the law
[1:40:40] required a kinsman redeemer and redeem a
[1:40:42] lost substance. Grace met this
[1:40:44] requirement in the person of Jesus
[1:40:46] Christ. Amen. God required a kinsman and
[1:40:48] he must be a human. He couldn't be an
[1:40:51] angel. He had to be a man because we are
[1:40:53] not kin to angel. We are kin to one
[1:40:55] another. The angel never fell. He's a
[1:40:57] different kind of being. He got a
[1:40:59] different body. Never sin or nothing.
[1:41:00] He's different. But the law required a
[1:41:03] kinman redeemer. And the virgin birth
[1:41:05] produced to prod. The virgin birth
[1:41:07] produced our kingdom redeemer. He was
[1:41:09] almighty God become Emmanuel. One of us.
[1:41:13] The kingdom redeemer was met. Oh glory
[1:41:16] to God. Hallelujah. So when Mary b Jesus
[1:41:19] that was the kingdom redeemer. He had to
[1:41:21] grow up now. The life had to unfold now.
[1:41:24] He had to go through his process now. He
[1:41:26] had a fancy min ministry, a nice
[1:41:28] ministry start up with signs and
[1:41:29] wonders, healing the sick, open the
[1:41:31] blind eye. But that wasn't the end game.
[1:41:33] The end game was to go to Calvary. But
[1:41:35] to go to Calvary, he healing the sick.
[1:41:37] He take bread and multiply it. He
[1:41:39] rebuked the storm. He demonstrated
[1:41:41] power. He raised Lazarus from the dead.
[1:41:43] And the enemy start to get more and more
[1:41:45] and more to come against him. He had a
[1:41:47] traitor in the church named Judas's
[1:41:49] Scariot. Isn't that right, to sell him
[1:41:51] out for 30 pieces of silver? But he knew
[1:41:53] he was God in service to die. He knew he
[1:41:57] was going to pay the price because in
[1:41:58] paying the price, he will get you back.
[1:42:00] He will get us back. He will take us
[1:42:03] back. Oh, give the Lord some praises. In
[1:42:05] paying the price, he can free you from
[1:42:07] your fears, from your pride, from your
[1:42:10] lust, from your jealousy, from your
[1:42:12] envy, from your cannality. Give the Lord
[1:42:15] some praises this morning.
[1:42:17] [Applause]
[1:42:24] Amen.
[1:42:26] So when they say who's worthy, here
[1:42:28] comes the lamb. Right hear this part. I
[1:42:30] have now made intercession for them. And
[1:42:33] now hear this. Write with me now. I want
[1:42:36] you to believe what is being said. We're
[1:42:38] not talking fairy tale. This not a
[1:42:40] novel. Somebody read fiction,
[1:42:42] non-fiction, somebody had ideas. This is
[1:42:44] not that. This is the word. Now hear
[1:42:46] what say. I am the kinsman. I am their
[1:42:49] redeemer. I now make intercession for
[1:42:51] them. But now I come to claim their
[1:42:53] rights for them.
[1:42:56] Oh, you mean this book tied with your
[1:42:59] rights. Without the book, you don't have
[1:43:01] the rights really because the books
[1:43:03] itself is an evidence.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] So you see what Jesus come for the book
[1:43:10] for? He said, I come to claim their
[1:43:13] rights. Amen. They have a
[1:43:16] right to everything that lost in the
[1:43:20] fall. Amen. And I pay the price. Oh
[1:43:23] brother, don't that make you feel
[1:43:25] religious. Not by good works we have
[1:43:27] done, but by his mercy. He said, "Wait a
[1:43:30] minute. Them elders begin to throw off
[1:43:32] their crowns and dignitaries begin to
[1:43:33] get on the ground. No one could do it."
[1:43:36] He said, "I am the mediator. My blood
[1:43:38] was shed. I have become man. I did this
[1:43:41] in order to get that church back again.
[1:43:44] The one that I foraw before the
[1:43:46] foundation of the world. I have purpose
[1:43:49] it. I spoke that it would be there and
[1:43:51] nobody is able to take it. I went down
[1:43:54] there myself. I am their kinsman. I
[1:43:57] become their kins folk. Oh, glory to
[1:44:00] God. What an act. What an act. Amen.
[1:44:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, he has the title
[1:44:05] to redemption. He has it in his hand.
[1:44:08] Watch this now. And the title of
[1:44:10] redemption of all creation is in his
[1:44:11] hand. And he come to claim it back for
[1:44:14] the human race. Not claim it back to
[1:44:17] angels. Claim it back to the human. You
[1:44:20] get the bomb now. Which it was given for
[1:44:25] to make sons and daughters of God again.
[1:44:28] So this
[1:44:30] book, this sealed book was given to make
[1:44:35] sons and daughters of God. Amen. That is
[1:44:38] why Jesus said you must be born again of
[1:44:40] the word and of the spirit and this is
[1:44:44] the word. This is the written word and
[1:44:47] he came to bring the spoken word which
[1:44:49] is the original seed. And as you receive
[1:44:51] the original seed, you could be born by
[1:44:54] the spirit and by the word truly born
[1:44:57] again. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:45:03] So he claim it back to human which it
[1:45:05] was given for to make sons and daughters
[1:45:08] of God again. Not to argue again. Not to
[1:45:12] say well I seen it so and people all
[1:45:14] seen it so they wear all kind of
[1:45:16] different color shades. They're not
[1:45:18] clear at all.
[1:45:20] So because you wear green shades, you
[1:45:22] know what happen? Everything seem
[1:45:24] greener. But you don't know they give
[1:45:26] you a green shade. Look at
[1:45:27] it. a green on your eye when you
[1:45:30] look around everything. Woo! Life is
[1:45:32] green, boys. Yeah. Because of what
[1:45:34] you're wearing. If you get the clear
[1:45:36] glasses now, you
[1:45:38] recognize different.
[1:45:40] So, it was given to make sons and
[1:45:42] daughters of God again to bring them
[1:45:45] back to Eden. Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:45:48] But I thought I was tired, but now I'm
[1:45:50] getting too old to preach. He said, "I
[1:45:52] get thinking I'm a young man again." He
[1:45:54] said, "Watch, somebody paid a price that
[1:45:56] I couldn't pay." Amen. That's right. He
[1:45:58] did it for me, Charlie. He did it for
[1:46:00] you. He did it for the whole human race.
[1:46:03] And he comes forth to claim his
[1:46:04] redemptive rights. Claim it for who? Not
[1:46:06] for himself. For us. Yes, sir. He is one
[1:46:10] of us. He is our kins folk. Amen. He's
[1:46:13] my brother. He's my savior. He is my
[1:46:16] God. He's my kinsman redeemer. He's all
[1:46:19] for what I was am without him. Praise
[1:46:22] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So
[1:46:24] watch. He said, "Don't weep, John. Here
[1:46:26] comes the lion. He had prevailed. And
[1:46:28] when you look, here come a lamb. Watch.
[1:46:31] Here come a lamb has been slain. And he
[1:46:32] come forth. What is it? I come to make
[1:46:35] his claim on redemption. He's done the
[1:46:38] kinsman work of redemption. Here we go.
[1:46:40] But has not yet called for his claim.
[1:46:44] Amen. So he comes on the scene to claim
[1:46:46] his rights. So first he a claiming he
[1:46:50] getting you just yet. He's claiming the
[1:46:52] rights for you. And it come down as a
[1:46:55] mystery. Amen. that is sealed in the
[1:46:57] word and he said the mystery of God
[1:46:59] comes down from God as the word of God
[1:47:03] and reveal the revelation of God. So
[1:47:06] then when we preach the word you getting
[1:47:08] the mystery in the form of the word your
[1:47:11] rights coming to you and understanding
[1:47:14] open up to you of what you can claim.
[1:47:17] Amen. So you may not know you could
[1:47:19] claim your healing effectively or claim
[1:47:21] your deliverance or claim your
[1:47:22] breakthrough or claim a revival or claim
[1:47:25] the deliverance of your family and home.
[1:47:27] So you don't know that you leave
[1:47:28] everything as is. But once you know that
[1:47:30] you could begin to work on your husband
[1:47:32] in prayer, work on your children in
[1:47:34] prayer. Work on your finances in prayer.
[1:47:36] When you pray in secret, your father
[1:47:38] received in secret going to reward you
[1:47:39] openly. Don't work on your phone. Work
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:47] He comes down to claim. He come down and
[1:47:50] do the kinsman work but has not yet
[1:47:51] called for his claim. He come to claim
[1:47:53] the rights for them. Watch what take
[1:47:54] place. Watch for he become a kinsman
[1:47:57] redeemer to die in his place to redeem.
[1:48:00] Watch his the days of intercession is
[1:48:02] over. Let him that f the still. This the
[1:48:04] land anointing him righteous righteous
[1:48:06] still holy still and so on like that.
[1:48:08] Now watch, he is stepping forth from
[1:48:10] eternity to take the title leaded book
[1:48:13] and to break the seals and reveal the
[1:48:17] mysteries when of it at the end time.
[1:48:21] Amen. So watch this. Let's put this here
[1:48:25] as Genesis the fall. Let's put this
[1:48:28] aside here as the end time. This book
[1:48:31] that went back in the original owner
[1:48:33] wait all these years for the end time.
[1:48:36] Amen. So the breaking of the seals is
[1:48:38] evidence. We are actually at the end
[1:48:41] time. Not the manifestation of what the
[1:48:44] seals have in it yet. Just the breaking
[1:48:45] of it. Because in Revelation 10, a
[1:48:48] mighty angel came out with the book.
[1:48:50] This time not closed but open. So this
[1:48:53] book that was once sealed that Adam lost
[1:48:57] redemption claim come back and the end
[1:48:59] time here a prophet a seven angel
[1:49:01] messenger right underneath there to
[1:49:03] catch this open book. Amen. that this
[1:49:05] mighty angel brought and this prophet
[1:49:07] now give it out to the bride in books
[1:49:09] and tapes and send ministers and
[1:49:11] preachers behind it to say the same
[1:49:12] thing to reiterate what was promised and
[1:49:16] bring a prophetic vision that you could
[1:49:18] see where you belong what you have to go
[1:49:20] into what you have to become as sons and
[1:49:22] daughters of a god according to the
[1:49:24] statue of a perfect man that was the
[1:49:26] prophetic vision he released glory to
[1:49:28] God first seal history second seal
[1:49:30] history third seal history fourth seal
[1:49:32] praise God poss right Fifth seal soul on
[1:49:35] the altar. Sixth seal judgment. But the
[1:49:37] seventh seal that connected the bride
[1:49:39] because seven thunders under there and
[1:49:41] those seven t what g the bride together.
[1:49:43] Your name was under the seventh seal.
[1:49:45] Your name not in history. H history
[1:49:47] already made up already. You can't go
[1:49:49] back to the bride in some other age. You
[1:49:51] are in this age. So your connecting seal
[1:49:54] to heaven to glory to translation is the
[1:49:56] seventh seal. Oh glory to God. The seal
[1:49:59] that end everything. It ends time. Oh it
[1:50:02] ends struggling nature. What can the
[1:50:04] Lord a shout? It end the vials, end of
[1:50:06] the plagues, end of the woes, it end
[1:50:08] everything. This breaking of the seventh
[1:50:10] seal. And he said at the vision of the
[1:50:13] seventh seal, we supposed to be all the
[1:50:14] way up there. Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:17] Hallelujah. Living faith, living virtue,
[1:50:19] living knowledge. We supposed to be up
[1:50:21] on top of brotherly kindness at the
[1:50:22] finishing of the seventh seal where the
[1:50:24] Holy Spirit could come down. Oh, glory
[1:50:26] to God. Like the anointing on Aaron's
[1:50:28] spear, the oil running down. The charity
[1:50:31] oil coming up upon you. Victory in the
[1:50:33] love divine. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:50:36] in the house. Love the burn of
[1:50:38] perfectness coming over you. Oh, give
[1:50:40] the Lord some praises. That's where we
[1:50:42] supposed to be at. At the finishing of
[1:50:44] the seven seal. Glory to God. Let
[1:50:47] America do their thing. Let Putin do his
[1:50:49] thing. Let Russia do their thing. But
[1:50:51] the bride going to do our thing, too.
[1:50:53] We're going to make a church. They're
[1:50:55] going to make a revival. Come on,
[1:50:57] saints. You could do better than that.
[1:50:59] Come on, saints. You could press this
[1:51:02] battle. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:51:04] Come on, saints.
[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:12] Let me make that statement again. The
[1:51:14] opening of the seals confirm that we are
[1:51:18] the end time. Amen. When Daniel was
[1:51:20] trying to understand some stuff, God
[1:51:22] tell Daniel, "Go thy way."
[1:51:23] The book is sealed till the time of the
[1:51:26] end. So we see the book unsealed
[1:51:28] unsealed since ' 63.
[1:51:32] So right now we in overtime right now
[1:51:36] a prophet stood in the 50s and said when
[1:51:38] to take the pope out of America. You
[1:51:41] know long that you know how long we
[1:51:42] watching that quote.
[1:51:46] We watching that quote for donkey years
[1:51:48] this year. Scripture fulfilled.
[1:51:52] Amen. But he just didn't say the pop of
[1:51:54] America, you know, he said other things
[1:51:55] too. When you see that, like a typost,
[1:51:58] like a signpost. When you see that, you
[1:52:00] understand what is next.
[1:52:03] So you can't sit down here in La La
[1:52:05] Land.
[1:52:08] Your com your sleep line like Morph just
[1:52:10] take a hold up on you. You're snoring,
[1:52:12] you're sleeping away. You can't sit here
[1:52:15] like in La La Land. He put it as a post
[1:52:17] when you see the Pope taken out of
[1:52:20] America.
[1:52:21] But wasn't a mad man. It means his, you
[1:52:24] see, that's what a prophet does. He goes
[1:52:26] into the future. Goes into the spirit
[1:52:27] realm. Goes in the future. See the
[1:52:30] future and come back and say, "Thus say
[1:52:32] the Lord." That must happen. He sees it
[1:52:34] already in the future. It might be 50
[1:52:36] years, 60 years. He say, "I see the
[1:52:38] bright is called. I see she's sealed
[1:52:40] into the kingdom of God." He went into
[1:52:43] the future and see the bright sealed and
[1:52:45] come back and say, "She is sealed." Oh,
[1:52:48] glory to God.
[1:52:50] Hallelujah. Jeremiah had to get it
[1:52:52] sealed and then put the seal thing in
[1:52:55] vessels. God get the seals and put the
[1:52:58] seals in you in your earthn vessels. Oh,
[1:53:02] give the Lord some praises. Because you
[1:53:04] are sealed with the book. Do I hear a
[1:53:07] shout in the house? You are sealed with
[1:53:10] the book. The same seven seals have to
[1:53:12] seal you. Seven seals, seven spirits,
[1:53:16] seven thunders, seven voices. You can't
[1:53:20] break that. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:53:22] praises.
[1:53:27] No man could break that. Grave not the
[1:53:29] Holy Spirit, whether you are sealed in
[1:53:32] seven parts until their redemption. Oh,
[1:53:35] give the Lord some praises.
[1:53:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So,
[1:53:40] what he say now? He break the seals
[1:53:42] when? At the end time and release all
[1:53:45] the mysteries to the seven angel whose
[1:53:48] message is to reveal all the mysteries
[1:53:51] of God. Amen. Not the messenger and
[1:53:53] another man. Not the messenger man from
[1:53:55] Trinidad. Not the messenger man from
[1:53:57] Europe or anywhere else. This messenger
[1:54:00] of Malachi 4 is to reveal all
[1:54:05] not here reveal something. You know we
[1:54:08] need a revealer coming a mini revealer.
[1:54:14] You know,
[1:54:15] this is the word here. The mystery of
[1:54:18] God lays in these seven seals. And the
[1:54:21] lamb come forth. Now watch. Nobody could
[1:54:24] take the book. It's still in the hands.
[1:54:26] No pope, no priest, whatever it might
[1:54:27] be, could take that book. Isn't that
[1:54:29] right? He come forth to take the book to
[1:54:31] reveal the mysteries of God that other
[1:54:33] have guessed. Isn't that right? All
[1:54:35] right. Let me skip that. Here we go. So
[1:54:37] he got the title deed of redemption
[1:54:39] within his hands. He said, "Then he
[1:54:41] claims his inheritance." That's the
[1:54:42] church, the bride. He claims it. What
[1:54:46] does he do then? He disposes of his
[1:54:48] contestant, Satan chose him into the
[1:54:50] lake of fire. He is king now. Mercy is
[1:54:53] still on the throne. Won't you reject
[1:54:55] his offer? Watch. He's claiming I can do
[1:54:58] with them. That's Satan now claiming I
[1:55:00] can do with them what I want to. I still
[1:55:02] have them. They are mine. They forfeited
[1:55:05] their title back there. Satan could stop
[1:55:08] that talk. They forfeited the title back
[1:55:11] there in Genesis. But watch but he now
[1:55:14] is the kinsman redeemer. Amen. He is
[1:55:16] back here making intercession now. But
[1:55:18] someday he will say the Satan say I put
[1:55:20] them in the grave. But he told the
[1:55:21] church I'll bring you out. So Satan
[1:55:24] making boing them in the grave. And
[1:55:26] Jesus I'm going to bring them out. I put
[1:55:28] this one in the grave but I'm going to
[1:55:29] bring them out. Death had no power over
[1:55:32] the bloodwashed one. Hallelujah.
[1:55:37] Amen. So watch, he calls the contestant
[1:55:41] hand Satan. They are mine now. I raise
[1:55:44] them up from the grave. And he takes all
[1:55:46] the liars and the perverters of the word
[1:55:48] and all that with Satan and destroy them
[1:55:49] in lick of fire. Here we go. All right.
[1:55:51] So this is the part we want to get down
[1:55:53] to now. When a person struck with
[1:55:55] disease, aches, pains, one time, they
[1:55:58] wasn't that way, but they're grown in.
[1:55:59] Why? They're not right. So you guys say,
[1:56:02] "Glory to God. Thank you, Lord, for the
[1:56:03] diabetes. Thank you.
[1:56:05] Hallelujah. High blood pressure.
[1:56:07] Hallelujah. This is the will of God for
[1:56:09] be high blood
[1:56:10] pressure. Satan say that's right. Satan
[1:56:14] go. Amen. Satan say amen.
[1:56:18] Will of God be sick. What's what's a bad
[1:56:19] thing? The second have to be God.
[1:56:23] You see why I'm getting that? I want to
[1:56:25] rock you because how many you too
[1:56:27] comfortable in your business. That's
[1:56:28] right. I want to disturb your spirit
[1:56:31] because some you lazy. And when you're
[1:56:33] lazy, you accept things as you know.
[1:56:37] That make good claims.
[1:56:40] When Baron was sick and doctor gave up
[1:56:42] on him and whatn not he said the devil
[1:56:43] say nothing. He said he he push it down
[1:56:45] your throat. He was vomited up. He push
[1:56:47] said I I think I um by stripe I'm
[1:56:50] healed. Amen. He vomit. He put it back.
[1:56:52] By stripe I'm healed. He do stop
[1:56:54] vomiting. He say he was lying. He wasn't
[1:56:56] lying. He said was confessing what God
[1:56:57] said. By stripe I'm healed. And he was
[1:56:59] healed. He make a determination of
[1:57:02] healing his mind.
[1:57:04] Amen. This woman with the blood issue.
[1:57:05] She wasn't a Christian. She wasn't a
[1:57:07] Baptist be believer waving spoken book
[1:57:08] and singing specials. No,
[1:57:13] she was an unbeliever person. But she
[1:57:15] heard about Jesus. Her husband tell her,
[1:57:17] "Don't go to that noisy church."
[1:57:20] And she told herself that morning. I
[1:57:22] think the doctor take the last of the
[1:57:23] money. I But if I go just touch him,
[1:57:26] I'll be healed. Amen. And God set it up
[1:57:28] for her to press. Notice God said Jesus
[1:57:31] on her throne and say, "Now we glor."
[1:57:33] And she just come and touch the hair.
[1:57:34] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. That's your
[1:57:38] expectation. People expecting message
[1:57:41] Jesus be sitting waiting on them. Jesus
[1:57:42] have nothing else to do. He's idle. He's
[1:57:43] waiting sitting on waiting to come touch
[1:57:45] the end of the garment. Touch. Give a
[1:57:47] test. Saints are touch.
[1:57:52] But no, when she come a press around
[1:57:54] him, all kind of big hard back men, all
[1:57:57] kind of characters, unbelievers, make
[1:58:00] believe, you name it. And she pushed.
[1:58:02] She had to push because she said touch.
[1:58:04] Yes. Not when I wave to him, he'll be
[1:58:06] healed. She didn't say that. She said
[1:58:07] touch the hem. So she had to get to the
[1:58:09] him where the hem is. All the men around
[1:58:12] the hem. Women all the way around. She
[1:58:13] had to push press. And when she did get
[1:58:16] to touch, he said, "Who touched my
[1:58:17] clothes?"
[1:58:20] Because she made a withdrawal and he
[1:58:22] felt it. He said, "I felt virtue left
[1:58:24] me." That mean he had it to give it. He
[1:58:26] had it to release it. He had it that he
[1:58:29] could draw from it. Oh, the Lord has
[1:58:30] shouted the house.
[1:58:33] Oh, this is real.
[1:58:39] Note what Jesus told the woman. Thy
[1:58:42] faith had made you whole. He never say
[1:58:45] my virtue hold you heal you. He say your
[1:58:47] faith because you see to get the virtue
[1:58:48] you have to have faith and she
[1:58:50] demonstrated she had the faith to
[1:58:52] receive a healing. He said by faith have
[1:58:54] made you whole. what you have here this
[1:58:55] morning. Some of you don't even have
[1:58:56] faith to praise God because if you open
[1:58:58] your mouth and give God praise, you're
[1:59:00] showing faith that you believe what God
[1:59:01] promised for you, it going to come to
[1:59:03] pass. Abraham stagger not at the promise
[1:59:04] of God through I cannot understand
[1:59:07] churches that are dead. Churches without
[1:59:09] praise and worship. I cannot understand
[1:59:10] that. That's a mystery to me. I don't
[1:59:12] know what sea under. That's a mystery.
[1:59:16] That is a mystery. That's a mystery. I
[1:59:18] have no revelation of
[1:59:23] talk about your name of the book. name
[1:59:24] on your book and you're not acting like
[1:59:25] John. Come on. The Bible said I read and
[1:59:28] John show with the book and he sat down

[1:59:33] my name is in the book. Glory
[1:59:34] hallelujah. And John stick his hand up
[1:59:36] like this. John shake his head.

[2:00:49] your feet. Thank God for your mouth.
[2:00:52] Thank God for your eyes, people. Some
[2:00:54] people can't see. Some people can't
[2:00:55] hear. Some people can't speak. Some
[2:00:57] people can't walk. Some people don't
[2:00:58] have their hands. Give the Lord some
[2:01:00] praises.
[2:01:04] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:01:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:10] Hallelujah.
[2:01:14] Hallelujah.
[2:01:16] Thank God for the activity in your
[2:01:17] limbs.
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:23] Somebody want to take your seat. You
[2:01:24] know, somebody will take your seat. You
[2:01:26] don't like it, somebody going to take
[2:01:27] your place. God going to bring it from
[2:01:29] the east, west, north, and south and sit
[2:01:31] down in your seat and give God praise.
[2:01:33] When they tell Jesus, your disciples
[2:01:35] making too much a noise, too much a
[2:01:37] noise. He said if they don't praise God,
[2:01:39] the rock going to cry out.
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:48] Jesus never
[2:01:50] bother with their no noise request.
[2:01:53] [Applause]
[2:01:55] Jesus never bother with their lower
[2:01:57] volume request. He said if they don't
[2:01:59] make noise, the rocks going to cry out.
[2:02:03] Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Blessed
[2:02:07] is he that cometh in the name of the
[2:02:09] Lord. You talk about worship. Oh, glory
[2:02:11] to God. When John stood, when the lamb
[2:02:13] took that book, it means Theo going
[2:02:15] free. When the lamb took the book, it
[2:02:17] mean I'm going to be filled with the
[2:02:18] Holy Ghost. When the lamb took the book,
[2:02:20] it mean I'm going to be a doctor. When
[2:02:22] the lamb took the book, the devil is on
[2:02:25] the run. Oh, glory to God. When the lamb
[2:02:27] took the book, all of that I'm lost. We
[2:02:30] getting back. We getting back spoken
[2:02:31] with power. We getting back power over
[2:02:33] the elements. We get power over
[2:02:35] diseases, power over sickness, power
[2:02:37] over all manner of diseases.
[2:02:42] God's not dead. He's alive.
[2:02:46] God's not dead. He's alive. He could
[2:02:50] heal cancer. He could heal tumor. He
[2:02:53] could heal heart condition. Oh, glory to
[2:02:55] God. He could heal your liver, your
[2:02:57] kidneys. He could take away your
[2:02:58] arthritis problem. Come on, give the
[2:03:01] Lord a shout. God's not dead.
[2:03:05] [Music]
[2:03:08] Hallelujah. Let
[2:03:12] [Applause]
[2:03:15] me see this. When somebody struck with a
[2:03:18] disease, aches, pains, they're groaning.
[2:03:20] Why? They're not right. There's
[2:03:22] something wrong. They're groaning trying
[2:03:24] to get back to where they was at health.
[2:03:26] And then the nature with people Bible
[2:03:28] are groaning shows that they need.
[2:03:30] They're not in the ought to be
[2:03:32] condition. They're falling home
[2:03:34] somewhere. We don't need anybody to
[2:03:36] interpret that for us. We know it was
[2:03:38] eternal life. Hallelujah. They lost
[2:03:40] their claims on eternal life by the fall
[2:03:42] of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal
[2:03:44] life to death in the garden of Eden and
[2:03:47] brought nature under them to death. You
[2:03:50] think Adam taught nature was going to
[2:03:51] fall? No. Adam, God spoke to Adam long
[2:03:54] before Eve come.
[2:03:56] God tell Adam of all the trees they may
[2:03:58] eat
[2:04:00] that tree don't touch that tree. The day
[2:04:02] you eat you shall surely die. God didn't
[2:04:04] tell that to Eve. Go tell that to Adam.
[2:04:06] Amen. When Eve come and his Adam had to
[2:04:08] teach his wife this three daughter Satan
[2:04:12] through the serpent didn't come to Adam
[2:04:13] you know he came to Eve where your
[2:04:16] husband he going to work hallelujah you
[2:04:18] know the story she should have run him
[2:04:20] straight out say when he come back come
[2:04:22] back now when she stopped to talk to him
[2:04:24] not slicker he was real slick he said
[2:04:27] what did God say because God not
[2:04:30] speaking to me
[2:04:33] she said God said very innocently God
[2:04:35] say we can eat all the tree and we eat
[2:04:38] that tree will die. Come on man, you
[2:04:41] shall not shout. Hear what God know? God
[2:04:43] know then the revelation break upon you.
[2:04:45] So your eyes will be open. You'll be
[2:04:48] wise. You'll be like God. You'll get
[2:04:51] access to higher knowledge.
[2:04:55] You might even think you are the Holy
[2:04:56] Ghost.
[2:04:58] That's how far you will think it. You
[2:05:00] just be like God. You and God is one.
[2:05:05] You say is so anytime you say is so
[2:05:09] trouble is
[2:05:15] so in my early days before Christianity
[2:05:17] I used to be doing yoga folding my leg
[2:05:19] trying to meet God and and block some
[2:05:23] rampant all kind of books reading and
[2:05:24] thing like that but they say you'll be
[2:05:26] one with God when you breathe in breathe
[2:05:29] out I breathe in and I breathe out I
[2:05:32] breathe in and I breathe out and when I
[2:05:34] finish Same T was still there. Same
[2:05:37] nature, same person. I say what is this?
[2:05:40] I am one with nothing. I want one with
[2:05:41] myself.
[2:05:43] Re this is fraud. This is fraudulent. I
[2:05:45] breathe in. I meditate. I feel calm and
[2:05:48] everything else. Afterwards, I recognize
[2:05:50] this is
[2:05:51] ridiculous. When I think transformation,
[2:05:53] the same old me. I get up there, same
[2:05:54] me. Anger, temper and you know what I
[2:05:57] mean? I'll fight a
[2:06:00] B. This a change nobody. This is this is
[2:06:03] corruption.
[2:06:08] Hallelujah. Eastern philosophy trying to
[2:06:10] tap my mind because I hungering for God
[2:06:13] but I don't know who God is. So one day
[2:06:16] s bypass walking I said God I don't know
[2:06:18] who you are. Are you praying now? Could
[2:06:21] you reveal yourself to me this year?
[2:06:24] And that year which is 974 December I
[2:06:27] was walking asking God I don't know who
[2:06:28] you are. Could you reveal that year 1975
[2:06:31] is when I get blessed in Jesus name.
[2:06:32] Amen. He revealed himself to me that
[2:06:35] year, 1975, and I can't look back. Can't
[2:06:38] look back.
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:47] So when somebody say there's God and
[2:06:48] there's the Holy Ghost and exist, I know
[2:06:50] it's trouble like Hinduism. Are you
[2:06:52] pastor already? They're not a new
[2:06:53] revelation, you know. That's a old one.
[2:06:56] And them had it first. Yes. Does anybody
[2:06:58] have that? Now that the fresh
[2:07:01] revelation you can find that on the
[2:07:03] hidden wisdom. Jesus said, "Receive the
[2:07:06] Holy Ghost." The Holy Ghost. You have to
[2:07:09] receive that. You can't be that. You
[2:07:12] have to receive that. Oh, give the Lord
[2:07:14] a shout. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. You
[2:07:18] shall receive power
[2:07:20] after the Holy Ghost come upon you.
[2:07:24] There's something that's come upon you.
[2:07:26] When it come upon you, you have
[2:07:27] different person all together. When the
[2:07:29] spirit come upon Samson, he dipped this.
[2:07:31] He dipped that. Glory.
[2:07:34] Hallelujah. One time they lock Samson in
[2:07:37] boy, they close the gate. You know them
[2:07:38] days have wall and gate and post and
[2:07:40] thing like that. They lock Samson
[2:07:41] finish. We catch him now. Lock him. When
[2:07:44] Samson the gates didn't stop, you know.
[2:07:47] S take up gate with post. Now it's one
[2:07:49] thing to remove the gate, you know. But
[2:07:50] the post too, you can't even hang back
[2:07:52] the gate. Oh, glory to God. He he take
[2:07:55] up the gate plus the post the gate was
[2:07:57] on. They have to get a post first before
[2:07:59] they hang that gate. Samson wasn't
[2:08:01] stopping, you know, because Sam
[2:08:02] revelation that thy seed shall possess
[2:08:07] the case of the enemy. Oh, give the Lord
[2:08:09] a shout in the house. Samson knew. When
[2:08:13] you're walking, keep walking. Conquer
[2:08:15] everything in front of you. When you
[2:08:17] leave here, you're walking like a
[2:08:19] conqueror. You're walking like a victor.
[2:08:21] When you leave here, your head, you have
[2:08:23] to overcome. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:08:25] praises.
[2:08:27] Oh my my my. Hallelujah.
[2:08:30] Hallelujah. Hear them.
[2:08:33] Now, Adam and Eve, in the beginning,
[2:08:34] there was a tree of right and wrong
[2:08:36] before them. And you say, "Well, it's
[2:08:37] their fault." No. Now, it isn't. It's
[2:08:40] your fault. You can't place it on Adam
[2:08:42] now. You got to place it on yourself
[2:08:44] because right is set before you. We on
[2:08:48] the same basis as Adam and Eve. Here we
[2:08:50] go. This part I want to get to. But you
[2:08:52] see, when we are
[2:08:55] redeemed, we no more want our own
[2:08:57] choice,
[2:08:59] but we want his choice. So this
[2:09:02] particular part is evidence of somebody
[2:09:05] that has been redeemed. They surrender.
[2:09:08] They don't want their own choice. They
[2:09:11] want God choice. That's why on my job,
[2:09:13] the first thing I tell people, I'm a
[2:09:14] Christian.
[2:09:17] But the first thing to the boss, to the
[2:09:19] workers, I'm a Christian. Amen. I let
[2:09:21] them know what I am. Yes. And the reason
[2:09:24] I'm doing that is because I felt that
[2:09:26] I'll be held accountable because I give
[2:09:28] a testimony. I'm a Christian. But if I
[2:09:30] don't, I'm a Christian. They don't know.
[2:09:32] That's right. So they pass a little
[2:09:33] drink and I'll take a little thing.
[2:09:36] Nobody know. You see what I'm talking
[2:09:39] about? Amen. But when you see you say a
[2:09:41] Christian and they pass the drink, they
[2:09:44] know Christian don't drink. But after a
[2:09:46] Christian when they start cussing
[2:09:47] because overcoming overcoming overcoming
[2:09:50] because they know I am not in the
[2:09:52] cursing environment and Baram say but
[2:09:55] after a while they respect the presence
[2:09:56] of God with you. Amen. Amen. So I know
[2:10:01] by experience what it is to live and
[2:10:05] have a Christian testimony on the job.
[2:10:07] Amen. I remember one time a girl I used
[2:10:09] to do some of her work for her. She was
[2:10:10] my boss at one time and um this was
[2:10:13] experiences that I've been through and
[2:10:16] some she had a business outside and she
[2:10:18] was doing a business coming late and
[2:10:19] everything else and I kind of cover one
[2:10:21] day Holy Spirit spoke to me said people
[2:10:24] and these were the words people don't
[2:10:26] respect you for what you give
[2:10:27] into people respect you for what you
[2:10:29] stand for. So I told her I would no
[2:10:32] longer do that. She was furious but
[2:10:34] afterward she respected me. Yes, I
[2:10:36] learned from that. You could please
[2:10:38] people too much. You could please people
[2:10:40] because you don't want to get upset. You
[2:10:42] you rub people the wrong way. Cut that
[2:10:44] nonsense out there. Amen. God is not
[2:10:46] that. People don't respect you for what
[2:10:48] you're giving to. Afterwards, you take
[2:10:50] like a sponge and you just wash rub
[2:10:53] every place with you.
[2:10:57] You use like a dish rub and you just rub
[2:10:59] you. You want to say clean something
[2:11:01] cola and you know
[2:11:04] so I had to tell her this is my job and
[2:11:06] that is your job. I am not using your
[2:11:08] job. That's right. Even though you my
[2:11:09] boss
[2:11:11] people respect you for what you stand
[2:11:13] for.
[2:11:15] Not what you're giving to. Stand for
[2:11:18] something. Give your testimony. This has
[2:11:21] to be visible. This has to have evidence
[2:11:24] with it that you believe what you
[2:11:25] believe. Say what you believe.
[2:11:30] So when we are redeemed, we no more want
[2:11:33] our own choice. Amen. We want his
[2:11:35] choice. Get this partner. Grace produced
[2:11:39] the person of Jesus Christ. Right.
[2:11:41] Christ this bomb has redeemed us
[2:11:45] now. We are now redeemed. But he has not
[2:11:49] claimed his possession yet. Amen. Now,
[2:11:52] brother Bam knew this was going to be a
[2:11:54] little controversial thing. So he said,
[2:11:55] "Now you might different with that, but
[2:11:57] hold a minute. He hasn't claimed it. He
[2:12:00] took the book of redemption. Everything
[2:12:03] that Adam had, everything that he lost,
[2:12:05] Christ redeemed back. He already
[2:12:07] redeemed us. But he hasn't took the
[2:12:10] possession yet. Amen. He cannot until
[2:12:14] the time appointed. Amen. And then will
[2:12:17] come the resurrection. Then the earth
[2:12:18] will be renewed again. And then he will
[2:12:20] take possession. His possession which he
[2:12:23] got when he redeemed us. But it will do
[2:12:25] it at the appointed time. Amen.
[2:12:27] Hallelujah. Now we see from this great
[2:12:30] plan of redemption is when and how it's
[2:12:32] going to be done. It is all hidden in
[2:12:34] this book of a mystery. It is sealed
[2:12:36] here with seven seals. Question. Are you
[2:12:39] ready? Question and answers. Brother
[2:12:41] Brham Brother. Is it true that every Jew
[2:12:44] since Christ would be saved? Who are who
[2:12:46] and who are the 144,000 are they the
[2:12:49] predestinated ones to be se with the
[2:12:50] Holy Ghost? And what is their mission?
[2:12:52] There's about three questions in there.
[2:12:54] The first one is it true that every Jew
[2:12:57] born since Christ came into the world
[2:12:58] will be saved.
[2:13:00] No. Nothing will be saved. Only those
[2:13:04] names were put on the lamp book of light
[2:13:07] for the function of the world. Jew or
[2:13:08] Gentile. That's all. Here we go. Are you
[2:13:11] ready? The book holds that mystery. And
[2:13:14] the book is only unfolding it now. Not
[2:13:17] each one's name, but what the mystery of
[2:13:20] the book is while it is calling those
[2:13:23] names. Amen. So when the word is being
[2:13:24] preached, your name is being called. The
[2:13:27] word is unfolding the mystery of your
[2:13:29] name. That is why you say amen. That is
[2:13:31] why you respond to it. He says, but what
[2:13:34] the mission of the book is while it is
[2:13:36] calling those names. You understand
[2:13:38] that? Now the book doesn't say now leave
[2:13:40] veil is to be saved in the time of this
[2:13:42] age or man. It doesn't say that. It just
[2:13:44] shows the mystery. It unfolds the
[2:13:47] mystery of what the thing is and we
[2:13:49] ourselves by faith believe it. Oh, glory
[2:13:52] to God. That's what I said the other
[2:13:55] night. Somebody said, "Well, there's no
[2:13:56] need of me trying it, Brother Brandham.
[2:13:58] There's only going to be one save out of
[2:14:00] Jville. It's showing a parable. That
[2:14:03] isn't it. There might be thousand save.
[2:14:05] I don't know. I hope every one of them
[2:14:06] is saved. I don't know. But here's the
[2:14:08] way I want you to believe it." Listen, I
[2:14:10] am that one.
[2:14:12] You believe the same for you. If you
[2:14:15] don't, then something wrong with your
[2:14:16] faith. Amen. So anytime you drop and say
[2:14:19] you know well you're trying already
[2:14:21] predestinate call already call I done
[2:14:23] you are done. Amen. If you don't there's
[2:14:27] something wrong with you. Praise God.
[2:14:29] Amen. All right. Let me see if we can
[2:14:30] wrap up here.
[2:14:34] So watch Ephesians 1 said in whom you
[2:14:36] trusted after you heard the word of
[2:14:38] truth the gospel of your salvation. in
[2:14:40] whom after you believe you were sealed
[2:14:42] with that holy spirit of promise which
[2:14:44] is the earnest or the down payment of
[2:14:48] inheritance until the redemption of the
[2:14:50] purchased possession.
[2:14:52] Now remember our redemption wasn't free.
[2:14:56] It cost. We were purchased by his blood.
[2:14:59] That is what the whole gospel is about.
[2:15:02] Purchased by the blood. Isn't that
[2:15:03] right? Now here he says here now. Now
[2:15:06] while we got the scripture open the Holy
[2:15:08] Spirit itself is a seal. Yes sir. The
[2:15:11] Holy Spirit is a seal. A seal signify
[2:15:13] what? A finished work. The Holy Spirit
[2:15:15] is being a sealed to the individual and
[2:15:18] to that individual when he received the
[2:15:20] Holy Spirit. His time of groaning is
[2:15:22] over. Amen. I used to work in a railway
[2:15:24] company and we load a box car with
[2:15:26] different things cannon factory and so
[2:15:27] on and the inspector come around to see
[2:15:29] that car was properly loaded and he
[2:15:31] would ram things together. It is scatter
[2:15:33] and stuff and break it. The inspector
[2:15:35] the railroad would be responsible and
[2:15:37] that inspector would test everything to
[2:15:39] see if it was properly in place. If it
[2:15:42] wasn't, he condemned the car. And we
[2:15:44] have to go over again until the
[2:15:45] inspector is satisfied. Are you ready
[2:15:47] now? That is what the Holy Spirit have
[2:15:50] been doing. He goes and he inspects.
[2:15:53] Yes. Did he say the pastor goes and
[2:15:55] inspect?
[2:15:58] So why you looking for me to come and
[2:15:59] inspect? I'm not coming to inspect. I am
[2:16:03] not the inspector. Sorry. That is not my
[2:16:05] calling. The Holy Ghost inspects. Isn't
[2:16:09] that right? And that's the reason you
[2:16:11] can't have these things. I spoke with
[2:16:13] tongue. shouted. The Holy Spirit
[2:16:15] inspects that person until he is
[2:16:17] thoroughly satisfied. Amen. And know
[2:16:19] what they are and then they are sealed
[2:16:21] until their destination can be. Hold
[2:16:24] that word redemption until the day that
[2:16:27] the book of redemption has been revealed
[2:16:29] and the redeemer comes forth to claim
[2:16:30] his possession. Nothing else can do it.
[2:16:33] So a seal signify what? A finished work.
[2:16:36] And when the seventh seal is broke, the
[2:16:37] mystery of God, that seal in this
[2:16:39] mysterious seals is finished. Amen. If a
[2:16:41] man is wondering what's in that box car,
[2:16:43] it's supposed to be such and such. He's
[2:16:45] presuming when the seat is broken, the
[2:16:48] door is open. Praise God. Hallelujah. Is
[2:16:51] the seven virtues seven does this, the
[2:16:53] seventh that? Don't worry, it going to
[2:16:55] break. And when it break, you're going
[2:16:56] to you're going to see all what it is.
[2:16:58] Oh, glory to God. Isn't that right?
[2:17:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. A
[2:17:03] seal signifies ownership. We're almost
[2:17:05] done. The seal has a mark on it. It
[2:17:08] shows ownership. Yes, sir. Praise God.
[2:17:11] Transfer from Satan's things to God's
[2:17:13] things. The seal put ownership on it.
[2:17:16] Abraham talk about them days are cattle
[2:17:18] branding. You put it in the fire and
[2:17:20] when you brand the cattle so they can't
[2:17:23] do they can't do that. Ouch. I get
[2:17:26] branded. See you have to tie down the
[2:17:28] capital when you put that you cinch them
[2:17:31] you know and when you let them loose
[2:17:33] just that they going crazy. But when
[2:17:35] they finish and they cool down they have
[2:17:36] been branded. Oh glory to God. So if
[2:17:40] you're going crazy a little bit only for
[2:17:41] a short time, but you know the brand
[2:17:43] coming on you, the brand of the Holy
[2:17:45] Ghost. Another thing to seal is
[2:17:47] security. Seal means that you are
[2:17:49] secured. Now notice this book is sealed.
[2:17:53] Are you ready? And you are sealed with
[2:17:55] the book. Amen. Until the day of
[2:17:57] redemption. So we're not quoting
[2:17:58] madness. We're not talking mad. You are
[2:18:00] sealed with the book. Yes, sir.
[2:18:01] Hallelujah. Glory. Jeremiah, evidence of
[2:18:05] purchase. My God. Don't you see in the
[2:18:09] shadows? We are now living by the
[2:18:11] evidence of the new land. Amen. The son
[2:18:14] of man. Amen. So, brother Brandham
[2:18:17] himself was evidence. Yes, sir. Of this
[2:18:20] new land. Amen. His life, his ministry,
[2:18:23] the power demonstrated through him was
[2:18:26] evidence of this land. Noah's ark was
[2:18:29] evidence that it was going to be safe
[2:18:31] from the flood. Noah building the ark.
[2:18:34] The ark was tangible. The ark was in
[2:18:37] front of them. Noah was saying by faith
[2:18:39] by faith make it flood coming in by
[2:18:41] faith and building ar you have all the
[2:18:43] dimensions to build the but you go by
[2:18:45] faith by faith. Stop talking by faith
[2:18:47] and start to build. Amen. Start to work.
[2:18:50] Work till Jesus come. Isn't that right?
[2:18:54] So William Brandon himself was the
[2:18:55] evidence of the promised land. He
[2:18:57] demonstrated power from the other side.
[2:19:00] Listen what the prophet says. Here we
[2:19:02] go. I say this my friend to every one of
[2:19:04] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:19:06] that every person in here was healed
[2:19:10] when Jesus died at Cal.
[2:19:14] It's your possession.
[2:19:17] I asked you to raise your hands who was
[2:19:20] Christians. Your hands went up
[2:19:22] everywhere. Then he said these words,
[2:19:25] you have a legal right to everything
[2:19:29] that Jesus died for. He died his death
[2:19:32] there at the cross and give his life
[2:19:34] that you might have the legal rights to
[2:19:37] every redemptive blessing he died for.
[2:19:40] It is yours. You are afraid to possess
[2:19:43] it. You are afraid to claim it. Musician
[2:19:47] come please.
[2:19:50] Musicians.
[2:19:55] Hallelujah. So the same way God redeems
[2:19:58] the earth, he redeems the man, the
[2:20:02] individual. Amen. Water baptized in
[2:20:04] Noah's day. His blood was shed on Jesus
[2:20:06] day and the earth is about to receive a
[2:20:08] fire baptism. But the righteous walk on
[2:20:10] the ashes of the wicked and hear the
[2:20:12] words. Here his words. He does the
[2:20:15] earth that he's going to use in the plan
[2:20:17] of redemption. But
[2:20:18] see the same way it repented and was
[2:20:22] baptized in water by Noah. Jesus come
[2:20:25] and sanctify it by the dripping of his
[2:20:26] blood upon it and claimed it. And the
[2:20:28] new earth that is to come is to have
[2:20:31] holy fire baptism to cleanses of every
[2:20:33] devil, every germ, every sickness,
[2:20:37] everything there is and make it a new.
[2:20:39] Amen. I saw a new heaven and a new
[2:20:42] earth. Here we go. Listen to church.
[2:20:46] Write with me. I'm closing. You become a
[2:20:48] new person.
[2:20:50] Not just a old patched up one by joining
[2:20:52] church or turn a new page. Amen. You are
[2:20:55] a complete brand new unit. God takes the
[2:20:59] old man and burns him completely out
[2:21:02] with the Holy Ghost and fire and comes
[2:21:04] himself and sends down your
[2:21:07] representation.
[2:21:08] Oh, praise God. Praise God. Could we all
[2:21:10] stand? The Holy Ghost fire. Hallelujah.
