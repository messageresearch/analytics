Lord anyone hear that touch from you from heaven and you touch them even while the thoughts of your word is going forward your word going forward that your healing virtue will go forth also granted Lord and pour upon us tonight the spirit appearance application we need it and we God bless you and thanks for being here tonight um it's always a privilege that we get together and call upon the name of the Lord so even your bibles are likely to turn into two portion Scriptures it clears fees chapter 11. I want to read verse 46. and we want to read psalms 126. that's talking about six verses they're not from 126 Ecclesiastes chapter 11 reading from verse 4. just everybody is fine tonight based on the water okay let's go he'd have observed to win Charlotte soon and he have regarded the clothes shot like me I don't know it's not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is the child even so don't know it's not the works of God who make it over in the morning should I see it in the evening with who will not die in hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good Psalms 126. when the Lord turned against the Captivity of Zion we were like them that dream then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing density among the Heathen the Lord and done great things for them the Lord had done great things for us where else we are glad then again our captivity oh Lord as the strings in the south tears shall reap enjoy he'd have great Fortune report bearing pressure seed shall doubt us come again with rejoice in bring her she's with him may God bless his word let's pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures tonight and I I pray God that you were to bring the right anointing the right inspiration the right words to your people tonight and open up from them a Channel of Prayer by Your Word in Jesus amen God bless you title of this thought I want to share with you tonight um it's data through tears this is kind of date of 20 years and but Obama was dramatizing about amram and his prayer now it's amazing that even though something is promised why do we still have to pray for it because God promised Abraham with a mighty hand he will deliver the people they will sojourned for foreign it is required that a burden of prayer comes to pray for that Deliverance it's almost as if God's pick his word but it takes man human it takes that Spirit appearance application to connect or activate or whatever it is as a channel by which God could fulfill his very own word so listen to this as we see it I'm wrong on those wearing nights back bleeding climbing up the steps again until two three o'clock in the morning praying it seems like you're just talking to the wind but dong in his Jewish heart they burn their feet but no Winds of doubts clever blood that's the kind of little woman we need to rise on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight he will tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this here he will next year for he is a God not egot but the god and we see night after night as amram climbed his steps and juicy dead would come up to him and he said you have been up there praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys where you were killing and let them pray your wife well honey what if they don't do it somebody's got to do it somebody's got to pray true so amram wasn't putting that burden on anybody else he'll do that himself that's what you got to do tonight that day we that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front of ourselves and go through if we believe in the Bible to be a history it's also a prophetic book that tells that the same quotas shall rise in the last days and it's time for him to come on the scene that's what I'm known that Moses have profit of London Moses pardon Abraham and then give him a promise by this court of History who hadn't answered a prayer in 400 years as far as you have a record but he made a promise that he would bring them out and it seemingly we have had a silent God for a long time but the hour has come where you're going to rise on the scene one night I don't remember what Creed maybe for seven years it is here no children agree for new Deliverance but just getting a voice one night he got right down to business look brother Branham dramatized free in getting down to business so he is seeing now that this particular night there was something different amram he pushed through he got on the business he said that is how we have to do it get right on the business he said God you promised this and we have looked forward to it we have seen the signs all year from the time it's time for you to do something about it so that's how another day while he was in these words deep concentrated prayer praying with all of his heart he looked handling in the corner he rubbed his eyes and looked again dear stood an angel just so drawn he said Deliverance is coming and you are going to bring a son into the world he is going to be the one to deliver them seek God always answers prayer doesn't he yes we just hold on so just think about it now God promised Abraham I mean yet God is listen carefully dependent on cameram's prayer in the season and time for the spark or the seed of that Deliverance to be activated so when anwam got onto business that night there was a special visitation in another visitation God said by you by your loins by your seed you are going to produce the deliverer and sometimes we tend to think that somebody else God going to use but how do you not know is you now but Abraham spoke about the Shekinah Glory and you talk about any study what can come into the presence of the Shekinah Glory you have got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it and that is a reference to the goddess of the throne so what do we learn from that you have to be given says to the presence of God anyone can read or listen to the word written or spoken but presence must be accessed you must get access or give access to the presence of God so regardless of the battles in your mind even tonight but the presence of God comes to the heart quickly but a Brandon and I make mention of this many times Israel was free from Pharaoh when they left Egypt the enemy was the system so the man says something when you are in the frame you can't see the picture because you are part of the problem you are part of the issues you are inside the frame and you can't see the picture you're supposed to say somebody outside could see it and speak so in Egypt it means then that they could discuss fear of the enemy and the enemy and that enemy was external they could point at it you could talk about it you could discuss it you could share it with others your enemy nicely your excuses why it is Justified what you do why you do it it'll justify in your mind the external enemy they were free from pharaoh but they were not free from themselves they came out of Egypt but Egypt didn't come out of that but Freedom carries responsibility that freedom carries accountability but Freedom you could learn you could you could you're free to connect somebody to Calvary 18 to do their own thing as if guys are there's nothing I guess a special number which is a woman eating is still growing you're still learning it's free to do what creature and Club key about you and circle your own family your own friends so they were free from Pharaoh but not from themselves I'm tearing companies now make yourself a question God adopted his own son gave him all the powers and Heavens he will do for you the same if you will stand here we go after you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian I act like a Christian should so we're not born Christians we're not instant like instant coffee or instant whatever become great no you have to become God if you put your face in God's word your eyes towards heaven and let your parents be buggered at the knees that is a prayer and be relevant before God there'll be someday that God will take you over to one side and give you a power earn the gift that the whole world will know he's been with you in position so my brother and sister today we're trying to make the nominations we're trying to build churches we're trying to organize people educate them it's all in them until the love of God comes in you want to speak with tongues you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to lose certain things to make yourself a Christian you will never be until the love of God takes over in your heart that tears that middle out that makes you feel for your brother that make you act like a man a child of God about Christ in you the hope of glory until they should come to that she was a total failure always will be all right do not throw in tears so when seed sticks more work in time and reaping and I want to identify soon as the work that has to be done okay so this stone is not just like plantain corn or agriculture I'm identifying that as the work that has to be done the work that has to be done even when they are challenging painful distrusting issues in your life challenges that will bring tears to your eyes why Lord why no why me why here if you do not soak listen carefully Church there will be no crops there will be no Harvest who went the work that has to be done you can't wait until you stop crying and then you would soon the scripture is 1 4 11 4 says he not observed the wind shall not so heat up regarded the clothes shall not read so you cannot look at the external as to do what needs to be done in other words you cannot wait for the situation to change or the circumstances to change and then you will soon you sow because you must you sow because the seed was getting to the ground is through whether you are crying or not used to in tears used to Under Pressure used to when it is hard the reality is there's work to be done praying is work praying is hard but praying is a must they want to pray and not defeat whether you are active or not whether you feel or not whether you feel like it or not true when you don't feel like it so in tears the tears don't produce the crop the swim does the tears don't produce the crop the swin produces the crown when everything around you want to make you quit through anyhow if your heart is broken through anyhow I wanted to shake this afternoon Shake yourself out of depression frustration Seekers have over given up Shake yourself tonight to util it's different from just soil people in tears want to be caught up in the emotions God this is the problem oh we're going through why ritual this but God wants you to do something and with your tears he wants you to sow in tears sowing in tears is special because it is sown in Brokenness a heart that Weeps around that Mourns tears of repentance tears of sorrowful sin to repentance you know watch the people who make excuses they always blaming this one they never accept responsibility these type of people don't grow they're growing they're going on they're just getting all because they don't want to deal with the responsibility of their behavior and their attitude and I always say maturity is when you can accept responsibility for your actions and your attitude not blaming anybody but my father my mother my uncle my brother my sister the pastor the taking the Elder you have nobody to blame you have a choice in tears is special is not wrong it's almost done yet Isaiah 53 when the Bible talk about what believer report or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he speaks about Christ shall grow before you must attend the plant the Rudolph has dry ground yet no form no comments when we see him there's no beauty that we should design listen to the bottom when I get to tonight he is despised are you despised rejected of men are you rejected Man of Sorrows do you have sorrow tonight acquainted with grief are you acquitted with Greece and we hear those we hid as it were or facing on him he was despised and we estimated not surely he had gone on Greece and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strictly spitting of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our Transmissions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement was of all peace was upon him with his choice we are healed all real like sheep not son or we like sheep go on his tree we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid upon him the iniquity of us Gore my Lord and as I close I want to encourage you tonight so in feet through in Thanksgiving through and Trust so in Repentance so in obedience so in love so in tears that God will bless your feed your seed could be your job your family your wiser children loved ones for your deliverance from whatever your business whatever Bridge you need you say Lord bless that seed second Corinthians 9 6 but this I see he was so experially shall reap Also spiritually and he that sweat bountifully shall reap also about it for me and final quote men and women it will make you stand to your feet it will make you do the things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else say about it the neighbor say oh that person has lost their mind they pray all night they read the Bible I don't care what they say it's what God called you to do that's right all they say we can't have this old-fashioned Pentecostal Revival oh yes we can too you can have it in yourself and you are the majority in God no matter what the rest of them think you are a majority in God you don't have to study what other people think what everybody think about you you want to know what God thinks about you tonight you have the soul and tears you have to store on the pain under stress on the distress if you're doing so when you're caught up in emotions your tears wouldn't produce the current your emotions can't produce the club is what you saw you could swing worship you could swing Thanksgiving if you're fine and stuff I'm grateful if you find yourself complaining complaining start this permitting tonight with Thanksgiving when we switch over to start to pray don't pray yet say what I thank you for today I can give some life I think it's disappearing me and thank you for your mercy I thank you for your love that you remember me thank you for taking the skills of my eyes that I could see this through that messenger there have been a baptism Methodist thank you stop with Thanksgiving thank you to despise the day of small things don't be angry at yourself and angry with God say God show you give you a fresh view of currency afraid of the Cross but Jesus pay that price for all of us but we could have access to his presence let us bar his heavenly father thank you tonight for your presence and for your spirit Lord I believe that you give me this thought to share about food and tell us to win what must be done and you talk about the mechanics getting your heart right doing all that we can do and then only God could send out the Dynamics won't you stand up your Dynamics tonight would you visit the people in their homes you promise to write a tree Once More I will meet you in there that could pull a room father oh Jesus as they pray may you answer as they pray that the anointing of the Holy ghosts sleep into their rooms sweep off with their hearts sweep over their minds may they be lifted up into trust trust in you why would we Sue we are not the producer of the marine or the Sun it's a faith action to sow to put a season to ground who knows when the rain will come be blessed but Lord we take up the Final Ground we take up and take all the rocks out of our hearts we dig up the ground and then we put in seed and we trust you for rain and we trust you with son we trust you for the good of the plant we trust you for the fruit the Harvest oh Jesus May every life here tonight connect with this revelation of Sewell putting the seed into the ground into the right kind of ground into the right kind of soil and may they leave here tonight with such a great faith and expectation that the God who spoke the word will keep this vote to pass Lord you even compared so sharmai would be that great fault out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall be accomplished and every sea that was spoken by this Prophet America will not fall to the ground it will surely come to pass bless your people now I think I don't want to prayer bless them as they praise God worship you bless them as they ask for healing and deliverance and break through and blessings bless
