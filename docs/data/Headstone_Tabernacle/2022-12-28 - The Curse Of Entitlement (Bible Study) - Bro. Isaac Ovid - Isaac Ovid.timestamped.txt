[12:29] praising that hallelujah thank you Lord
[12:31] name of the Lord
[12:33] it's certainly a great privilege thank
[12:35] you so much brother Anthony it's
[12:36] certainly a great privilege to be here
[12:38] tonight can we just borrow heads for a
[12:41] word of Prayer
[12:42] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[12:45] you this evening Lord to be able to
[12:48] gather a lord in your presence we thank
[12:51] you for this privilege this sailor this
[12:55] pause this time lord maybe we could cut
[12:58] through the noise and we could interrupt
[13:01] the schedule of Our Lives that are times
[13:05] almost feels as if it has been planned
[13:08] out for us because situations come
[13:10] challenges come
[13:12] issues arise that would attempt to just
[13:17] pull our time pull our attention pull
[13:20] away our Focus so we thank you for this
[13:23] welcome Interruption lord it's not
[13:27] always convenient
[13:29] father but Lord it is a decision that we
[13:33] have made to report in for Duty as
[13:37] soldiers again sometimes how we feel
[13:40] against the stresses of Our Lives to
[13:43] come together around your word knowing
[13:45] that it's an opening a window a door
[13:48] into the heavenlies and the mind of God
[13:51] and that just five minutes in the
[13:54] presence of God could change
[13:56] our situation could change our
[13:59] circumstances and so many times we look
[14:02] at things one way and when we come into
[14:05] the presence of God we see it your way
[14:08] help us to see it uoe tonight may you
[14:11] speak to us through your word Lord may
[14:15] you use me as your instrument may you
[14:18] take control of my vocal cords and bring
[14:21] my thoughts Lord under your control Lord
[14:25] we submit ourselves to your Authority
[14:27] tonight we pray for the body of
[14:30] Believers that I've gathered here
[14:31] tonight we pray for those that may hear
[14:34] this tape we pray for those that are yet
[14:35] to join us Lord we commit this study
[14:38] into your hands and we pray for Lord
[14:41] every person and their own individual
[14:43] challenges their own situations those
[14:46] that they are comfortable to share or
[14:48] speak and even those that they don't
[14:50] want anybody to know about but we thank
[14:53] you that you are Lord the great
[14:55] physician you are the great great healer
[14:57] you are a great Mighty counselor all the
[15:00] psychologists and the psychiatrists and
[15:03] the counselors and the gurus as it were
[15:05] are just are just a fraction of what you
[15:08] are as the great counselor so may you
[15:10] counsel us through your word tonight and
[15:13] Lord may it be that we could leave this
[15:15] meeting with a different perspective you
[15:18] said be transformed by the renewing of
[15:21] our minds Lord that renewing of our
[15:24] minds is a reboot as it were Lord it is
[15:28] it is it has been such a a different
[15:30] year and as we come to the end of this
[15:32] journey of this 2020 that has been
[15:35] filled with so many curveballs and so
[15:38] many corners and so many turns we thank
[15:40] you for your spiritual leadership that
[15:42] has helped us two in every corner so we
[15:45] commit the service into your hands Lord
[15:47] and if there's anyone sick anyone
[15:48] needing untouched as the word Goes Forth
[15:51] Lord May healing come with the word Lord
[15:53] as you said you would do you are still
[15:56] in control we commit it into your hands
[15:58] today in the precious name of Jesus
[16:00] Christ amen and amen and amen
[16:03] well it's certainly a great privilege to
[16:04] be together again just praising the Lord
[16:08] and to be reporting for Duty in such a
[16:12] time as this and I want to physically
[16:15] start by really appreciating uh brother
[16:19] for the service on Sunday uh last Sunday
[16:22] it was really a tremendous tremendous
[16:24] Masterpiece of a message so run that you
[16:27] may obtain and it the way it was
[16:32] presented and dealing with entitlement
[16:35] and dealing with the prodigal son I
[16:37] shared with him I've never seen it
[16:39] presented that way and I love it when we
[16:42] could look at the word and see it
[16:46] presented in in a way that is in line
[16:49] with the word but you can you can see
[16:52] the the the the
[16:53] relatableness if that's a word of it you
[16:56] know to see that you could relate to the
[16:58] situation so I want to kind of continue
[17:01] along that vein uh tonight
[17:04] um so
[17:06] I have a little
[17:07] thoughts
[17:09] um so remember me in prayer and the
[17:12] internet has been acting up a little bit
[17:14] for me as well so if I do dip out but
[17:17] over that has assured me that he is
[17:18] standing by
[17:20] um
[17:21] if necessary
[17:24] um so for uh uh uh teaching tonight I
[17:27] want to call this the curse of
[17:29] entitlement
[17:30] because of entitlement and you know as
[17:35] Boulevard was preaching I just want to
[17:36] kind of talk with you you know Bible
[17:37] studies these sessions on Tuesday are
[17:39] conversation it's not a service so I
[17:40] could just kind of chat a little bit and
[17:42] have a conversation so I know you can't
[17:45] respond but I trust everybody is doing
[17:46] fine uh trust that
[17:48] um you know you're hanging in there I
[17:50] trust that your sword shop you know I
[17:53] trust that the trials that come in your
[17:56] way you know they have been designed for
[17:58] you I trust that the gifts of these
[18:01] trials that God has sent you away You
[18:03] Realize by now that they are designed
[18:06] for you to come to maturity for you to
[18:09] be strong you know and uh you know as
[18:12] well everybody was preaching on Sunday
[18:13] you know I was looking at the word and I
[18:16] was looking at my own life and and that
[18:18] is my Approach personally and if you
[18:21] could take a page from it tonight is it
[18:24] is that singleness of focus to see how
[18:28] the world impacts you it is very easy to
[18:32] wonder how the word impact somebody else
[18:34] you know it is nature to look at other
[18:37] people but when I'm you know in church
[18:41] or in a service I'm always looking to
[18:43] see how can I be stronger as a Believer
[18:46] you know what can I learn from it it's
[18:48] easy to look at other people and and say
[18:50] well you know there's a word for her or
[18:52] him or whatever but I really want to see
[18:55] how the world has impacted my life and
[18:57] this mental reality of entitlement the
[19:00] spirit of entitlement
[19:02] it it got me
[19:04] you know at first I went from I went
[19:07] through different emotions if I can say
[19:08] that on on Sunday different you know
[19:11] points and if you haven't seen the
[19:12] message I encourage you to so watch it
[19:14] and if you have seen it I encourage you
[19:15] to watch it again
[19:17] but I went through different emotions
[19:19] different thoughts as the service was
[19:21] going on because he was speaking about
[19:22] entitlement and
[19:25] and I realized that this thing goes as
[19:29] far as there will be people
[19:32] who they feel that they're entitled to
[19:35] go to heaven
[19:38] and they're not
[19:42] there are people who believe that they
[19:44] are entitled because they're any message
[19:46] they will make the rapture
[19:48] so I started to reach that point
[19:51] of looking at this thing called
[19:52] entitlement
[19:53] because this thing of entitlement
[19:55] it's when
[19:57] you convince yourself that you deserve
[20:00] something based on some pretext that is
[20:02] your own
[20:04] you know and as I was going through it I
[20:07] was looking at probably presenting the
[20:08] prodigal son and I was kind of starting
[20:10] to look through scripture and I was like
[20:13] I never really thought of it that way
[20:15] because you know we see them when we
[20:16] preach this you know the Bible say one
[20:18] day people go and say Lord Lord I've
[20:20] done all these things for you and go to
[20:22] City apart from me you workers of
[20:24] iniquity you woke up iniquity so it
[20:26] means that that person who is speaking
[20:28] to God actually believes that what they
[20:30] have done was enough to qualify them to
[20:33] enter in and God is saying it really
[20:35] wasn't
[20:36] the fact that he has to address it to
[20:38] them and say depart from me
[20:40] is shattering their belief that they
[20:43] were qualified
[20:45] it is shattering their belief that they
[20:47] were entitled you know I have but rub it
[20:50] said something really powerful Sunday
[20:51] and I and and it it shook me because he
[20:54] said that during this whole pandemic and
[20:56] I was seeing a statistic
[20:58] um published by a group of Christian
[21:03] you know
[21:04] analysts around the world
[21:06] and they were actually saying during
[21:07] this pandemic
[21:09] as far as they can tell
[21:11] one-fifth meaning one out of every five
[21:15] Christians in this pandemic have not
[21:18] shown up for virtual service
[21:23] so they were going to say that made a
[21:26] statement on Sunday he said this
[21:28] pandemic some people will go out and say
[21:31] people will come in
[21:34] and it may be as I was just going to I'm
[21:36] just sharing with you I'm going to get
[21:37] to the teaching in a bit I'm just
[21:38] sharing some thoughts with you to to
[21:39] just you know play some context on where
[21:42] I'm at so I was just wondering so I say
[21:45] the people who haven't shown up
[21:48] um because if Church coming to your home
[21:50] now as it is
[21:52] then what is the excuse if you're not
[21:55] working on your home
[21:58] then why wouldn't somebody connect
[22:01] but if you have a conversation with them
[22:03] they actually feel entitled
[22:06] or they believe that they still go into
[22:08] heaven or they believe in their in their
[22:10] context that they're on the way to the
[22:12] Rapture if you ask them a question you
[22:14] know where's the destination as they're
[22:17] comfortable because there's some level
[22:19] of entitlement
[22:21] and when you look through the wood
[22:24] there's no there's no support for that
[22:27] position
[22:28] the only way people can miss something
[22:30] is because they thought they were there
[22:32] and weren't
[22:34] because there's nobody
[22:36] I can't find somebody who is
[22:37] deliberately trying to miss the Rapture
[22:39] so so let me tell you so people aren't
[22:42] coming to church trying to miss the
[22:44] rapture
[22:44] that that that doesn't mathematically
[22:47] add up unless there's something mentally
[22:48] wrong with you people are not showing up
[22:51] to church deliberately trying to
[22:53] self-sabotage it's not deliberate
[22:55] so if it is not deliberate then it means
[22:58] that there is this expectation that is
[23:01] not in alignment so call it a personal
[23:03] expectation that is not an alignment
[23:05] with God's expectation
[23:08] because I find it very difficult to
[23:09] believe that after all these years
[23:12] of hearing you would
[23:14] of seeing scripture fulfilled of seeing
[23:17] the unfolding of Prophecy yes but
[23:19] Ibraham would say modern events made
[23:21] clear by profiting but by by prophecy so
[23:24] it's happening before very eyes how
[23:26] people could be complacent
[23:28] and and entitlement is really is really
[23:31] taking it for granted
[23:33] so it's there's so many ways to look at
[23:36] it so in time so a ticket for granted
[23:38] because of X this should happen and the
[23:42] reality is God doesn't operate that way
[23:45] you know what it really said the shape
[23:47] into our core so I started to look in
[23:49] scripture to get a basis written but
[23:51] over kind of kind of mention some things
[23:53] but you know
[23:55] our society has developed into this
[23:58] level of entitlement so I could speak
[24:01] from a position of being a a manager so
[24:05] to speak
[24:06] so you have people who graduate from
[24:09] University
[24:11] and they believe that because they have
[24:14] a degree they're entitled for certain
[24:16] things
[24:18] it has nothing to do with whether they
[24:20] have the experience
[24:21] where they could deliver value
[24:24] it is an entitlement that comes from
[24:26] well I did this so I should have this
[24:30] So within we'll say within certain
[24:33] professionals or certain industries or
[24:34] with any government sector or there's
[24:37] this entitlement that comes with well
[24:39] I've been here for a long time so I have
[24:41] seniority
[24:42] so because I have seniority I am
[24:45] entitled to whether it is the promotion
[24:48] The Parking Spot I'm entitled to the
[24:50] cubicle or the corner office so it is
[24:54] something that is spiritual and it's
[24:56] natural and people either fight because
[24:59] they feel they're entitled they they
[25:01] they fight a certain way so
[25:04] the point I'm trying to make is Sunday
[25:05] service brought to the surface
[25:09] all the things that we are entitled to
[25:11] and Amber Robert brought this powerful
[25:14] thought about the connection between
[25:16] entitlement and comparison
[25:18] and I will show in the scripture how
[25:21] much God hates that and two specific
[25:24] references of that comparison and the
[25:27] entitlement issue so if I were to
[25:30] identify tonight what the teaching
[25:32] points out of this session is tonight it
[25:35] is to strip away that feeling of
[25:37] entitlement that taken it for granted
[25:40] that that because there's a scripture
[25:43] that speaks of don't let a man eat if he
[25:45] awoke
[25:46] the fact that the scripture needs to be
[25:48] said means there are people who want to
[25:49] eat without working
[25:51] so if if the situation didn't did not
[25:55] exist there would be no need for the
[25:57] scripture so God every man I want to
[26:00] work he shouldn't you don't deserve to
[26:01] eat if you don't want to work
[26:03] so he was making a connection between I
[26:05] call it earning or working
[26:08] and I may have said it before but the
[26:10] root word for worship
[26:12] and the root word for work is the same
[26:15] word so work and worship are connected
[26:18] so worship is actually a form of work
[26:22] and we know through scripture that
[26:24] praise is a sacrifice and a sacrifice
[26:27] means it has a cost to something
[26:29] and but over it was really inspired when
[26:31] he talked about the free and we actually
[26:33] see it in the scripture what is free and
[26:36] say okay there's there's nothing really
[26:37] free there is a cause so so salvation is
[26:41] free but there's a cost which was
[26:43] Calvary
[26:45] so I want us to to understand that
[26:47] there's a there's work there's always
[26:49] work involved so salvation is free but
[26:52] Jesus worked
[26:55] and the Believers who will climb the
[26:58] mountain
[26:59] it can be out of laziness or it is not
[27:03] accidental it has to be deliberate so
[27:06] you have to have a mindset so I realized
[27:08] so much this mindset because if you have
[27:11] this entitlement situation going on it
[27:14] means you take this position of
[27:18] give me do for me I should have it so
[27:20] because I I should have it I don't need
[27:22] to work for it because I'm entitled to
[27:24] it
[27:26] and it removes the need to work for
[27:28] something and I want us to push past it
[27:31] because coming tonight is work
[27:33] I covered over a little while ago I say
[27:35] I actually just got home I had a meeting
[27:38] it is not as if home I said along to it
[27:40] in my terms
[27:42] everything in in life is work prayer is
[27:46] work
[27:47] reading your Bible is work
[27:50] going to work is work
[27:52] you have to work on your marriage you
[27:55] have to work on your relationship with
[27:56] your children
[27:57] you have to work to be in church on time
[28:00] you have to work to be in this meeting
[28:02] tonight
[28:03] so everything is about work and it is it
[28:06] is is that activity and that that
[28:08] forward movement that forward momentum
[28:11] finding a way to reach where you need to
[28:14] reach so
[28:15] I want to encourage you tonight by kind
[28:18] of digging a bit more into this issue of
[28:21] entitlement the the mentality of it the
[28:24] spirit of it and as my title is the
[28:28] curse of entitlement because
[28:30] if ever there was a time that people
[28:33] were entitled it's no people feel you
[28:36] know you walk in a place um
[28:38] let me get your Wi-Fi password now
[28:41] and there are some people who will walk
[28:42] into your home or your business whatever
[28:44] and if you give them your Wi-Fi they're
[28:46] looking at it is you any problem you
[28:48] know
[28:51] they don't see it as is
[28:53] it's your wife something wrong with you
[28:57] for not giving any Wi-Fi password
[28:58] because we have gotten entitled we feel
[29:02] we deserve to have it we we need to
[29:04] connect we are we are so it is something
[29:07] that is so pervasive there are people
[29:09] who will feel they entitled to a certain
[29:11] seat in church
[29:13] people feel entitled to a certain Park
[29:15] I'm not trying to go anywhere I just I
[29:17] just throw in context you know people
[29:19] feel it and so there's so much so I want
[29:21] us to continue to look because brother
[29:23] had me going through my own
[29:26] introspection because always the word
[29:30] has to make you look at yourself to see
[29:32] how you're lining up with your word and
[29:34] to see if there's any behavior that you
[29:36] have
[29:36] that shouldn't be there
[29:38] and automatically self-correct
[29:42] self-correct is like a GPS I know if you
[29:44] ever use a GPS or use Waze or something
[29:46] and you know if you miss a corner
[29:49] the thing automatically will tell you
[29:51] okay make the next right and if you fly
[29:53] past that next right it will tell you
[29:55] will make the next right because they're
[29:56] trying to get you back to wherever your
[29:58] destination was that you're supposed to
[30:00] be going
[30:00] and every surface for a service was is
[30:03] about really self-correction it's about
[30:05] you were coming to say listen you're
[30:07] going too much to the left you know get
[30:09] back to the highway you know so that is
[30:10] the context I want to study teaching I
[30:13] don't intend to be too long with you
[30:15] tonight
[30:16] um so I want to start by saying our
[30:18] society our world even the church
[30:20] business
[30:22] has this entitlement mentality
[30:25] I can't tell you how many business
[30:28] people have spoken to who feel that
[30:31] things should just work out
[30:33] and it's it's an entitlement that it it
[30:36] is that it should happen and it really
[30:38] shouldn't happen until you make it
[30:40] happen because there's no accident
[30:42] there's no there's no it's supposed to
[30:45] it is all about work
[30:48] and this is not just natural it is
[30:50] scriptural because the Israelites
[30:53] coming out of Egypt had such a horrible
[30:58] entitlement mindset it was it was
[31:00] incredible I'm going to over reference
[31:02] it
[31:03] we know this story the children of
[31:05] Israel
[31:06] was in Egypt in bondage
[31:08] and they cried out to God to take them
[31:11] out of bondage we know this God dropped
[31:14] the plagues
[31:18] their bondage
[31:20] but yet still when they come out and
[31:23] they break out and they never thought
[31:25] they could get out and they really
[31:27] wanted to get out and they had a hard
[31:29] labor and the grandfather was a slave
[31:31] and the father was a slave
[31:35] so I had reached I was staying Exodus
[31:41] Exodus 16 3.
[31:50] and the children of Israel said unto
[31:52] them
[31:53] word to God
[31:58] we had died by the hand of the Lord in
[32:01] the land of Egypt
[32:03] when we sat by The Flash spots which is
[32:06] which is the meat
[32:10] and when we did eat bread to the full in
[32:12] other words we ate till we couldn't eat
[32:15] no more
[32:18] for ye have brought us forth into this
[32:20] Wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[32:23] with hunger
[32:24] so hold on
[32:26] these are the same people who cried they
[32:29] were bondage for 400 years and now that
[32:33] they're out of bondage they're actually
[32:36] making a comparison between the meat and
[32:40] the bread that they ate in their full
[32:45] so now let's get to my substantive so
[32:47] we're going to go to the Book of Numbers
[32:48] 11.
[32:53] numbers 11.
[32:55] and we're going to read from verse 1.
[33:00] and this is where we're going to spend
[33:02] most of our time tonight and we're going
[33:03] to try to bring it to a close like I
[33:06] said forgive me if my connection drops
[33:11] so numbers 11 how many lovely Book of
[33:14] Numbers
[33:21] numbers 11 and verse 1.
[33:24] and when the people complained it
[33:27] displeased the Lord
[33:29] all right so I want to start I want to
[33:31] stop right here for one second
[33:34] you know how much people love to
[33:35] complain
[33:37] we before we go deeper
[33:42] what are the worst things you could do
[33:44] as a Believer is complain
[33:48] I have to look at myself you have to
[33:49] look at yourself We complain too much
[33:54] you complain about the traffic you
[33:57] complain people who diving too slow you
[34:00] complain the list your complete list God
[34:04] help us to bring our complaints to zero
[34:07] that's that's the challenge and that's
[34:09] what I want to challenge everybody with
[34:10] tonight
[34:11] stop complaining
[34:14] you could change your life tonight but
[34:16] just stop complaining
[34:19] I was challenging we had an officers a a
[34:22] team leaders meeting and I challenge the
[34:25] leaders
[34:26] I said listen
[34:28] change your complaining into into
[34:30] gratefulness that whatever it was
[34:32] teaching that on Sunday it was so
[34:33] powerful because for everything you can
[34:35] write down write down everything you
[34:37] want to complain about and I could tell
[34:38] you the list is much longer about what
[34:41] you could be thankful about
[34:43] and if you don't know where to start
[34:44] just thank God that you're alive let's
[34:46] start with that
[34:48] because I don't know what complaint you
[34:50] possibly could have that could even deal
[34:52] with the fact that your life
[34:55] did you eat today whether you eat cricks
[34:58] where they eat eat lettuce you remember
[35:00] we read in scripture in Proverbs better
[35:03] is a meal of herbs
[35:06] where love is you remember we had our
[35:08] conversation so whether today was cricks
[35:10] and and bitter herbs
[35:14] you have something to thank God for but
[35:16] I want you to see it's not just about
[35:17] not complaining I want you to see that
[35:20] when did people complete it displease
[35:22] the Lord and the Lord heard it
[35:25] so it's not just that God hearing your
[35:27] personal God also hear any complaints
[35:31] and your complaints affecting God
[35:35] now in the Amplified that says now the
[35:38] people became like those who complain
[35:39] and whine about their hardships
[35:43] so it is not as if God don't know you
[35:45] have hardships you know but his point is
[35:47] don't complain
[35:49] and the Lord heard it and when the Lord
[35:51] heard it his anger was kindled
[35:53] all right
[35:55] and the fire of the Lord burnt among
[35:58] them and consumed them that were in the
[36:01] uttermost parts of the camp
[36:04] so God started to judge the children of
[36:06] Israel deaths because of complaining
[36:09] I want you to start to look at your life
[36:11] no I want to encourage you tonight by
[36:13] firstly saying you can't change your
[36:15] past you can't change what happened an
[36:17] hour ago or 20 years ago so we put in a
[36:20] a a a reset button in this meeting
[36:23] tonight
[36:25] your attitude your approach your
[36:28] statements whatever is going on prior to
[36:30] this meeting we're putting a stop in it
[36:31] tonight and putting a hard reset because
[36:34] you can't change it but you have control
[36:36] from this meeting forward what happens
[36:39] next but I want us to draw reference
[36:42] that complaining actually brought death
[36:45] complaining broad judgment
[36:47] so complain about your business your job
[36:50] your boss the rent the house the roof
[36:53] the car the church the neighbor the
[36:56] government the prime minister the police
[36:58] the election the whatever you want to
[37:01] complain about stop it there's there's
[37:03] nothing in Scripture that supports
[37:05] complaining
[37:06] so we want to establish a foundation so
[37:08] when somebody have this complaining
[37:09] attitude they need to refer them to this
[37:12] the Lord consumed them that were in the
[37:14] uttermost part of the camp so the Lord
[37:18] burn and devoured those in the outlying
[37:20] parts of the camp
[37:23] verse two this is and the people Cried
[37:26] unto Moses
[37:29] and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the
[37:32] fire was quenched
[37:33] so it was Moses prayer God I wanted to
[37:36] see this now God was so upset at the
[37:39] complaining that he started to Reign
[37:41] judgment and Moses after the people come
[37:43] to Moses said Moses look what God doing
[37:45] Moses went to pray to stop the judgment
[37:48] and what was his sin
[37:50] because remember sin is judgment
[37:52] God only judges based on sinner so what
[37:56] does that mean complaining is equal to a
[37:58] sinner
[38:00] oh
[38:01] you never saw it that way before
[38:03] so let's bring a parallel here
[38:06] God Reign fire on Sodom and Gomorrah
[38:10] for the way they lived God Ran fire on
[38:13] the turn of Israel because they're
[38:15] complaining
[38:18] so I want us to show sometimes we
[38:20] operating that okay we above this and we
[38:23] above that and I don't do this and I
[38:24] don't do that and God say look at your
[38:26] complaining
[38:27] and he is angry because what complaining
[38:31] means is you throw in God's blessings
[38:33] back in his face let me say it again
[38:37] for you to complain because God is
[38:39] blessing you
[38:40] your next break is a blessing come on
[38:43] now
[38:44] did the area just breathe is a blessing
[38:48] the fact that you can be here is a
[38:49] blessing some of us don't even see it
[38:51] that way
[38:52] the job you have is a blessing
[38:55] the little opportunities you have is a
[38:57] blessing because you are under a
[38:58] different Covenant so other people can
[39:00] look at other things and attribute
[39:03] success or achievement to other things
[39:04] but whatever you have your luck your
[39:07] position is by the grace of God and when
[39:09] you complain God sees it as after all I
[39:12] have done for you you still acting as if
[39:15] I haven't done nothing
[39:16] so I want you to reposition in your mind
[39:19] where complaining fits it
[39:21] and we're building now to how this is
[39:24] tied to entitlement now all right
[39:26] and the people Cried unto Moses and when
[39:28] Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was
[39:30] quenched and he called the name of the
[39:33] place Tavera because of the fire of the
[39:36] Lord burned among them
[39:38] let's go to verse 4.
[39:41] and the mixed multitude
[39:45] that was among them fell a lusting
[39:48] now in the Amplified
[39:50] it says do you Rebel among them who
[39:53] followed Israel from Egypt had greedy
[39:56] desires for familiar and delicious food
[40:01] and the Israelites wept again so this is
[40:04] where it is mind-boggling to me
[40:07] because if you complain in verse 1 and
[40:11] you see what God did how could you come
[40:13] and even complain again
[40:14] so this reminds me of what Abraham
[40:16] saying he could preach till he blew in
[40:18] the face
[40:19] until you are really converted your
[40:22] behavior not changing you know
[40:24] so they just witnessed people complain
[40:26] and God judged them and here it is and
[40:29] the mixed multitude that was among them
[40:31] fellow lusting and the children of
[40:33] Israel also wept again
[40:35] and said who shall give us flesh to eat
[40:40] who will give us meat to eat is what the
[40:43] Amplified says let's dig deeper
[40:45] now this is where brother was preaching
[40:48] and I was like whoa
[40:52] listen to the context we remember the
[40:55] flesh we remember the fish
[40:57] which we did eat in Egypt freely you see
[41:00] the word freely there we'll come back to
[41:02] that in a minute we remember the fish
[41:04] which we did eat in Egypt freely the
[41:08] curcumas and the melons and the leaks
[41:11] and the onions and the garlic
[41:15] so they were now
[41:18] they were actually equating they
[41:20] actually they're such a disconnect in
[41:23] their condition that they forgot that
[41:25] they were in bondage when they had this
[41:28] I want us to catch that for a second
[41:34] let me let me just I want to just make
[41:36] another Point here
[41:46] so even though it is free they actually
[41:49] forgot the great price that came with
[41:52] this free food
[41:57] they forgot the cost of this free food
[42:00] quarter Gold free you remember brother
[42:02] was saying on Sunday anything that is
[42:05] free somebody paying for it
[42:08] so they themselves were paying for their
[42:10] free food by their bondage
[42:13] it's very confusing to me to see this
[42:15] because it means that they were almost
[42:17] sound something like they were willing
[42:19] to give up freedom to go back to this
[42:24] I want you to think about that for a
[42:25] minute it was willing to give up Freedom
[42:27] it would seem to go back to this
[42:30] verse 6 but now our soul is dried away
[42:33] the soul is in
[42:38] our soul is driving when there's nothing
[42:41] at all beside this manner before our
[42:43] eyes
[42:45] God give you Freedom keep providing for
[42:48] you and you're throwing it in God's face
[42:49] I want you to see how God started
[42:51] process is now right
[42:52] and the manner was a coriander seed and
[42:56] the color thereof as the color of the
[42:58] dillium
[43:00] and the people went about and gathered
[43:02] it and ground it in Mills or beat it in
[43:05] a mortar and beat it in pans and made
[43:07] cakes of it and the taste of it was as a
[43:10] taste of fresh oil
[43:12] and when the Dew fell upon the camp in
[43:14] the night the Mana fell upon it
[43:18] then Moses heard the people weep
[43:20] throughout their families
[43:24] every man in the door of his tent
[43:29] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[43:32] greatly Moses also was displeased
[43:39] so the Deep question here tonight so far
[43:42] is
[43:44] did they really want to be free
[43:48] because
[43:49] there was a price of Freedom here it is
[43:52] they were free but here it is they
[43:54] actually feel entitled
[43:57] to more than what God has given him at
[43:58] that point in time and look how God
[44:00] treated with it and we're going to build
[44:01] into something in a bit I'm not going to
[44:03] be too long with you
[44:06] verse 11 and Moses said unto the Lord
[44:08] wherefore has thou Afflicted thy servant
[44:14] in other words why have you been so hard
[44:16] on your servant
[44:18] and wherefore have I not found favor in
[44:21] thy sight that thou lays the burden of
[44:24] all these people upon me so the
[44:26] complaints of the people because they
[44:29] felt entitled to more than what God was
[44:31] given them was so great that it brought
[44:33] a level of of pain in Moses own life
[44:38] have I conceived all these people
[44:41] so Moses now saying lord it's not my I
[44:44] didn't conceive them or no
[44:46] have I begotten them that thou should
[44:49] say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a
[44:51] nursing father bearing the sucking child
[44:54] unto the land which thou swear is unto
[44:56] their fathers
[44:58] when should I have flesh to give unto
[45:01] all his people
[45:02] so this became a major issue for the
[45:05] true individuals and for Moses
[45:07] for they weep unto me saying give us
[45:09] flesh that we may eat
[45:14] now we reach a point now and this is
[45:16] interesting this is a point in Moses
[45:18] life which I don't know many of you see
[45:19] where Moses this letter Moses almost
[45:22] getting depressed
[45:26] Moses said I am not able to Bear all
[45:29] these people alone
[45:31] because it is too heavy for me
[45:35] it became overwhelming for Moses
[45:39] now bear in mind this is after Moses
[45:41] leviture and out of Egypt this is this
[45:44] is in a mature stage of Moses Ministry
[45:48] he was able to weather Pharaoh he was
[45:50] able to weather the place was able to
[45:52] whether the media and he was able and
[45:53] here it is it reached a point because of
[45:55] the complaints of the people
[45:57] because of the emotion of the people
[45:59] because of the attitudes of the people
[46:02] he is saying listen this is now too much
[46:04] for me
[46:05] and many of us situations come to us and
[46:07] we say this is this is too much
[46:09] he said if thou deal thus with me kill
[46:12] me I pray thee
[46:14] out of hand if I have found fear in thy
[46:17] sight and let me not see my wretchedness
[46:22] in the Amplified it says so if this is
[46:24] the way you are going to deal with me
[46:26] please kill me at once if I have found
[46:28] favor in your sight and do not let me
[46:30] see my wretchedness
[46:33] so I want to draw a parallel because he
[46:35] went through Elijah's own situation
[46:38] and here we see Moses coming to his own
[46:41] position where he was feeling like
[46:43] almost giving up
[46:46] so I want to remind us as a people and
[46:49] as a church
[46:50] that having the emotional feeling to
[46:52] give up is something that people go
[46:54] through
[46:55] but time and time again we're seeing
[46:57] that having the feeling of wanting to
[46:59] give up or through your hard to say is
[47:01] this is this worth fighting
[47:03] is that word Preston is it a word keep
[47:05] him going after all these years
[47:07] I'm time on time again we see God will
[47:10] provide Grace and strength no matter how
[47:12] you feel in the time of your need to
[47:15] give you that in Elijah case it was the
[47:17] juniper tree experience the place of
[47:20] rest in Moses case we'll see it Moses
[47:23] gets the help that he needs he gets his
[47:25] support system that he needs so he could
[47:27] fight
[47:28] but the situation that existed prompted
[47:31] all of this
[47:34] verse 16.
[47:36] and the Lord said unto Moses I'm going
[47:39] somewhere because I want us to see now
[47:41] that and I've made a point before
[47:42] friends and I wanted to catch this
[47:45] because this entitlement thing
[47:47] people go and do what they want to do
[47:49] because they feel they entitle the
[47:50] happiness on their tombs
[47:54] are push in there now right so they feel
[47:57] entitled so they feel the entitled to go
[48:00] and have the friends they want to have
[48:01] that's that's the that's pushing
[48:03] entitlement now they want to go and do
[48:05] what they want to do
[48:06] and this is the painful part
[48:10] when when you come back to God or you
[48:13] get restored I want us to understand
[48:15] that God
[48:17] is just and he is consistent
[48:20] you get him back to God doesn't change
[48:22] the consequences of bad decisions you
[48:24] make huh
[48:27] because God is a god of his word
[48:30] God can forgive you and still discipline
[48:34] you at the same time
[48:36] it's a paradox
[48:41] let me say it again God could forgive
[48:43] you
[48:45] and still discipline you
[48:48] because he's a god of his word
[48:51] and we'll get it
[48:52] and the Lord said unto Moses
[48:55] so I want us to understand what led to
[48:57] this
[48:58] so now we're coming into administration
[49:00] of Return of Israel but what prompted
[49:03] this was a bunch of ungrateful people
[49:06] because they made it seem as if they
[49:08] prefer to be back in Egypt
[49:10] like how many people come to church come
[49:13] to the message come to the Lord and
[49:15] because things in their mind don't work
[49:18] on the way they think it should or they
[49:20] say well when I was in the world I have
[49:22] more money when I was in the world I
[49:24] used to when I was in the world because
[49:26] this is what they are saying there we
[49:28] remember when we was back in Egypt this
[49:30] is how it was
[49:31] but now we come into this new place this
[49:34] new Journey this new experience we're
[49:36] coming to the deeper aspects of the
[49:38] world
[49:39] I do have as much friends as I used to
[49:41] have before so I find in an evening I do
[49:43] have too much things to do but when I
[49:44] was there I used to have people lying
[49:46] with me no
[49:48] you you see the connection and God is
[49:50] saying when you talk like that you make
[49:52] me wonder why I bring you out to Egypt
[49:55] because you need to know what you really
[49:57] want to value
[49:58] are you valuing and this this
[50:01] description of the fish and the
[50:03] cucumbers and the melons and the leeks
[50:06] and the onions could be anything huh
[50:09] anything that use of value because when
[50:12] somebody backslides backslide means to
[50:14] go back where you were before you slide
[50:16] back
[50:17] it is something in the sliding back
[50:21] that is still connected to your heart
[50:23] that pulls you back
[50:25] so you're trying to do this New Path but
[50:27] you're still looking back to when I used
[50:30] to when I used to when I used to this is
[50:32] what they were saying here and the
[50:34] complaints was
[50:35] I don't know friends I don't have this
[50:38] we don't have fun
[50:40] I had more time when I was in the world
[50:43] had more time but now now is service on
[50:46] Sunday and bible study on Tuesday and
[50:48] service on Wednesday I'm permitting on
[50:49] Friday I have no evenings
[50:54] we're dealing with with yet we're
[50:55] dealing with mindset nowhere
[50:59] entitled
[51:05] so Moses now reaching this point like
[51:09] many of us reach many leaders reach this
[51:12] level of complaining is too much so God
[51:15] is about to deal with it and look how he
[51:17] deals with the situation and I want you
[51:18] to see and we need to understand this
[51:20] because God starts to deal with this
[51:22] situation by bringing structure
[51:24] you need structure in your life
[51:28] it sounds simple but you need structure
[51:30] you need to know when you're going to
[51:32] pray you need to know when they're going
[51:33] to read you need to have structure to
[51:35] your life and the Lord said unto Moses
[51:37] gather unto me 70 men of the Elders of
[51:40] Israel whom does knowest to be the
[51:43] Elders of the people and officers over
[51:46] them and bring them into the Tabernacle
[51:48] of the congregation that they may stand
[51:50] there with thee
[51:52] and I will come down and talk with thee
[51:55] there and I will take of the spirit
[51:57] which is upon thee and put it upon them
[52:01] and they shall bear the burden of the
[52:03] people with thee that thou be it not
[52:06] thyself alone
[52:08] you see that that that's powerful so
[52:10] that is God now seeing the burden upon
[52:13] Moses seeing the amount of people seeing
[52:15] the amount of needs and saying let me
[52:17] bring some structure around Moses
[52:20] so that Moses after beard is burden
[52:22] alone
[52:24] and that is why I really want to salute
[52:25] the officers of the church
[52:28] who support the office of the pastor
[52:30] because it's impossible to carry to
[52:32] carry the burden alone
[52:34] it was so in the New Testament as well
[52:36] that is why the deacons were created
[52:39] because when they looked at the
[52:41] situation there were people with needs
[52:45] and God wanted it that the ministry can
[52:47] focus on the bringing of the word the
[52:49] breaking of the bread the opening of
[52:51] mysteries steady people
[52:54] that's why it's impossible for you to be
[52:56] part of a church and not want to know
[52:57] how you could help
[52:59] how we could support
[53:03] anybody with me tonight
[53:06] Verse 18 and say thou unto the people
[53:09] sanctify yourself against tomorrow and
[53:13] you shall eat flesh
[53:15] for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord
[53:17] saying who shall give us flesh to eat
[53:20] for it was well with us in Egypt so God
[53:23] now this is serious serious serious
[53:26] therefore the Lord will give you flesh
[53:28] and he shall eat
[53:30] that I want to soak in that verse 18.
[53:36] I want to read it in the Amplified say
[53:38] to the people consecrate
[53:40] separate as holy yourselves for tomorrow
[53:42] and you shall eat meat for you have wept
[53:46] in self-pity
[53:47] you see that South PT thing in the ears
[53:50] of the Lord seeing who will give us me
[53:52] to eat for we will well off in Egypt
[53:56] so God is repeating what they are saying
[54:02] God and discard what they're saying he
[54:04] put in it in contact because he's coming
[54:05] to deal with this complaint and this
[54:08] entitlement that came from being in
[54:10] Egypt
[54:11] therefore the Lord will give you meat
[54:13] and you shall eat listen now so God said
[54:17] this is what you want listen to verse
[54:19] 19. you shall eat you shall not eat one
[54:22] day nor two days nor five days neither
[54:25] 10 days nor 20 days so God is saying you
[54:28] want to eat
[54:30] it's not gonna be two days it's not
[54:32] gonna be five days it's not gonna be ten
[54:34] days no 20 days listen but even a whole
[54:37] month
[54:39] God is now answering so this is I want
[54:42] you to be careful now
[54:44] when you cry for the wrong thing
[54:47] and you're flying the face of God God
[54:50] said this is what you want okay fine
[54:53] but even a whole month until it come out
[54:57] at your nostrils
[55:00] and it below some unto you because that
[55:04] you have despised the Lord which is
[55:06] among you
[55:08] and have wept before him saying why King
[55:11] we fought out of Egypt
[55:13] friends this is serious I want to soak
[55:16] in this a little bit
[55:18] because
[55:20] I want to build friends I don't know if
[55:23] I'm expressing the right way but too
[55:25] many people complaining and flying in
[55:27] the face of God and they're wondering
[55:29] why things operating so and God is
[55:32] literally putting a pause on your
[55:35] activities because he's saying you are
[55:37] not acknowledging me you're talking
[55:39] about how things used to be and how this
[55:41] was and you're looking outside and
[55:43] you're not looking at what I'm doing for
[55:44] you right now
[55:49] and the fact that God is repeating this
[55:51] thing about Egypt is as if God's saying
[55:53] this thing is reference of Egypt just
[55:54] getting upset
[56:00] you shall eat verse 19 not you shall not
[56:03] eat one day nor two days nor five days
[56:06] neither 10 days not 20 days but even a
[56:08] whole month in other words your one meat
[56:10] take meat I wouldn't give it for one day
[56:12] but I'll give you a whole month until
[56:14] you're coming out your nose
[56:17] you will get so much meat that you would
[56:20] it will be load someone to you you'll
[56:22] get immediately heated
[56:24] the Lord because you have despised the
[56:27] Lord despite means hey the Lord
[56:32] I want to read me amplify because I want
[56:34] to I want it to stick but a whole month
[56:36] until it comes out of your nostrils and
[56:37] is disgusting to you because you are
[56:39] rejected and the spicy Lord who is among
[56:43] you and have wept in self-pity before
[56:45] him saying why did we come out of Egypt
[56:51] verse 21
[56:53] and Moses said the people among whom I
[56:57] am are 600 000 footmen and thou has said
[57:01] I will give them flesh that they may eat
[57:03] a whole month
[57:06] shall the flux and the herds be slain
[57:09] for them to suffice them so Moses saying
[57:12] these are how much men are with me shall
[57:14] he flux in other words the animals we
[57:15] have be slain for them to suffice them
[57:17] or shall all the fish of the sea be
[57:20] gather together for them to surprise
[57:21] them so Moses saying Lord is a lot of
[57:24] people we talk about here
[57:25] is it about to kill all the animals we
[57:28] have to get all the fish so Moses
[57:29] himself trying to wrap his mind around
[57:31] how God going to do this
[57:35] and the Lord said unto Moses is the Lord
[57:38] that stands whacked short
[57:42] that thou shalt see now whether my word
[57:46] shall come to pass under thee or not
[57:49] so God said to Moses After all you've
[57:51] been through you will ask me a question
[57:53] like how I'm gonna do it
[57:55] no I want you to understand something
[57:57] this is I want you to see a sight of God
[57:59] people don't normally get to see this is
[58:02] God doing something
[58:04] and he's doing it
[58:06] I don't want to say with reluctance but
[58:08] he's doing it with very intentional
[58:10] because he's doing it because they asked
[58:12] to it but he's going he be doing this
[58:14] with judgment title
[58:17] you're not doing it out of blessing you
[58:20] want it take it
[58:22] because I have been providing your needs
[58:25] but you're what you want
[58:27] you're so fussing about it you're
[58:29] stressing on the man of God
[58:33] Hallelujah
[58:36] you're going past what my provision is
[58:39] for you and the reason point that you
[58:41] have a man of God frustrated
[58:43] the man of God wants to know he want to
[58:45] give up he he reached a point based on
[58:47] your complaints that he said listen God
[58:50] just kill me yes
[58:54] and not only that you keep referring to
[58:56] how you used to live
[58:58] you keep your foot into how things was
[59:00] before you came into connection with my
[59:02] blessing I want to make sure the message
[59:03] gets home so you keep referring to you
[59:06] know when I was in the world you know
[59:08] why do people in the world and and God
[59:11] hate it he hates it
[59:16] verse 24 and Moses went out and told the
[59:19] people the words of the Lord and
[59:22] gathered the seventy men of the Elders
[59:24] of the people and set them around above
[59:27] the Tabernacle
[59:28] and the Lord came down in a cloud and
[59:31] spake unto him
[59:33] and took of the spirit that was upon him
[59:36] and gave it unto the seventy elders
[59:41] you ever read this before so you see you
[59:44] see how easy it is for the brother to
[59:46] say that when you look at the church
[59:48] that the the spirit of the pastor is
[59:50] many people
[59:54] that the anointing on a man can be on
[59:56] somebody else
[59:57] here it is God is saying clearly I took
[59:59] his spirit for my mom Moses and divide
[1:00:02] it upon the people
[1:00:05] and gave it unto these seventy elders
[1:00:07] and it came to pass that when the spirit
[1:00:09] rested upon them they prophesied and did
[1:00:12] not cease
[1:00:14] so suddenly it is now Moses and 70 men
[1:00:17] around Moses all under the spirit and
[1:00:19] testimony of Prophecy and they didn't
[1:00:21] stop prophesying the anointing is upon
[1:00:23] them
[1:00:28] verse 26
[1:00:30] and there remain two of the men in the
[1:00:33] camp the name of the one was eldad and
[1:00:37] the name of the other midad
[1:00:39] and the spirit rested upon them
[1:00:42] and they were of them that were written
[1:00:44] but went not out unto the Tabernacle and
[1:00:48] they prophesied in the camp
[1:00:58] verse 27 and they ran a young man and
[1:01:01] told Moses and said eldad and Mirad do
[1:01:04] prophesy in the camp
[1:01:07] and Joshua the son of nun the servant of
[1:01:11] Moses one of his young men answered and
[1:01:13] said my Lord Moses forbid them
[1:01:16] and Moses said unto him envious thou for
[1:01:18] my sake
[1:01:20] what God had all the Lord's people were
[1:01:22] prophets and that the Lord would put his
[1:01:25] Spirit upon them
[1:01:26] and Moses got him into the camp he and
[1:01:30] the elders
[1:01:31] of Israel
[1:01:33] verse 31.
[1:01:35] and they went fought a win from the Lord
[1:01:37] and brought quails from the sea and let
[1:01:41] them fall by the camp as it were a Day's
[1:01:44] Journey on this side and as it were a
[1:01:46] Day's Journey on the other side round
[1:01:48] about the camp and as it were two qubits
[1:01:51] high upon the face of the Earth
[1:01:57] hmm
[1:01:59] and the people stood up all that day and
[1:02:02] all that night and all the next day and
[1:02:05] they gathered the quails he that
[1:02:07] gathered leaves gathered ten homers and
[1:02:09] they spread them all abroad for
[1:02:11] themselves around the camp
[1:02:19] verse 33
[1:02:21] and while the flesh was yet between
[1:02:24] their teeth
[1:02:27] hmm
[1:02:28] it was chewed
[1:02:31] the Wrath of the Lord was kindled
[1:02:34] against the people
[1:02:36] and the Lord swore the people with a
[1:02:39] very great plague
[1:02:44] in the amplifier that says while the
[1:02:46] meat was still being still between their
[1:02:49] teeth before it was chewed
[1:02:52] so in other words as they bite before
[1:02:54] they even get to chew it the anger of
[1:02:56] the Lord
[1:03:00] struck them with a severe plague
[1:03:06] so this is what I this is why I call it
[1:03:08] the curse of entitlement
[1:03:12] and he called the name of that place
[1:03:15] because they buried the people that lost
[1:03:19] it
[1:03:22] and the people junied
[1:03:25] and we'll end there without reading
[1:03:28] on that part tonight
[1:03:30] I just want to share a few more things
[1:03:32] on this thing
[1:03:37] entitlement
[1:03:41] is based on
[1:03:45] this belief that because of x
[1:03:49] you are entitled to a certain thing
[1:03:52] so you believe that because you are from
[1:03:54] a certain family you should have
[1:03:57] something because you have a certain
[1:03:59] education you should have something
[1:04:01] because you any message you should have
[1:04:03] something because you did this you
[1:04:06] should have X
[1:04:08] whatever it is whether it's our standard
[1:04:10] of living whether is you're supposed to
[1:04:13] be happy whether it is all entitlement
[1:04:16] and you will find as you dig in
[1:04:19] Scripture
[1:04:20] you know there are a lot of people who
[1:04:22] and we talk about it your trials and and
[1:04:24] conquered all joy and and we talk about
[1:04:26] that he's suffering to this present time
[1:04:28] are not willing to be compared with the
[1:04:31] glory that should be revealing us and
[1:04:33] you'll find other Christians complain
[1:04:35] about the trials and intestines
[1:04:38] and as much as we preach about it
[1:04:40] listen I just have some ideas you know
[1:04:42] or your your ending so
[1:04:45] wait now you think eyes have just happy
[1:04:48] Happy Days
[1:04:53] we all have rough days
[1:04:57] it takes great strength to smile when
[1:05:00] you be horrible you know
[1:05:04] and I was looking at the scriptures as
[1:05:05] look at Paul in in in in Philippians 4
[1:05:08] 11 you'll have to find it I'll just
[1:05:10] share tonight I'm not gonna be too long
[1:05:12] I just wanted to just add some things to
[1:05:14] what about Robert said on Sunday
[1:05:18] Paul said in the Philippians not that I
[1:05:21] speak in respect of want
[1:05:24] so Paul is saying I'm not speaking in
[1:05:28] the position of having
[1:05:31] for I have learned
[1:05:33] learned
[1:05:36] in whatsoever State I am there with to
[1:05:39] be content
[1:05:42] I find this is powerful
[1:05:44] so this is not something that Paul was
[1:05:46] born with
[1:05:48] Paul was saying that he learned and this
[1:05:51] is this is him this is this is a
[1:05:53] scripture that helps us with this
[1:05:55] entitlement thing so so luckily look at
[1:05:58] Paul's example in verse 12 I know both
[1:06:00] how to be a beast
[1:06:04] do you know how to be a beast
[1:06:07] do you know how to live low
[1:06:09] do you know how to live with with bread
[1:06:12] and bread
[1:06:15] as even I even say bread and butter you
[1:06:17] know I say bread and bread
[1:06:19] do you know what it is to be a beast
[1:06:22] so Paul is saying my life situations by
[1:06:26] what I've gone through I've not realized
[1:06:29] and we'll see where the scripture ends
[1:06:31] up that it's a journey God carries us
[1:06:33] through
[1:06:34] so listen to Paul I want to say he said
[1:06:37] I know both how to be a base and how to
[1:06:39] abound
[1:06:41] everywhere
[1:06:44] and in all things
[1:06:46] I am instructed both to be full and to
[1:06:50] be hungry
[1:06:51] both are bound and to suffer need
[1:06:56] so this is Paul this is this is this is
[1:06:59] this is to me this is so exciting
[1:07:01] because Paul is in I've learned
[1:07:04] it didn't come naturally it's not
[1:07:06] something I was born with I learned to
[1:07:08] deal with the Mountaintop
[1:07:10] and I've learned to deal with the values
[1:07:12] I've learned to live when my account
[1:07:15] have money and when they have no money
[1:07:18] and this is the context of the scripture
[1:07:21] because one of the greatest challenges
[1:07:22] we have with scripture is people like to
[1:07:24] take a scripture and use it like a wedge
[1:07:26] like a weapon
[1:07:28] without the context this is the lead up
[1:07:32] into reverse I can do all things through
[1:07:36] Christ which strengtheneth me this
[1:07:38] scripture I can do all things it's not a
[1:07:40] license to say I can build a plane
[1:07:43] the context of this scripture is taken
[1:07:47] from The Narrative of Paul explaining I
[1:07:49] can do all things as in live on the
[1:07:52] mountain and live in the valley because
[1:07:54] it is God who strengthens me to be able
[1:07:56] to behave when I'm on the mountain and
[1:07:58] live when I'm in the Valley I can do all
[1:08:01] things be in a position of being a beast
[1:08:04] or abounding you know how many
[1:08:06] Christians can live in abound
[1:08:08] oh come on let's push now you know which
[1:08:11] Christians cannot live in a spirit in a
[1:08:12] space of success and that is why God
[1:08:14] will keep you in a certain place because
[1:08:16] the moment you start to rise you start
[1:08:18] to lose your connection to The God Who
[1:08:21] helping you to rise
[1:08:24] you have to learn how to live there you
[1:08:26] know
[1:08:27] it is not something that happens
[1:08:28] automatically
[1:08:30] and if you haven't gone through the
[1:08:31] lesson let's bring in more personal if
[1:08:34] you haven't gone to the lesson of
[1:08:35] learning how to live a base God will
[1:08:37] make sure you pass that exam too
[1:08:41] because Paul's testimony is an example
[1:08:43] to us Paul could have because Paul was
[1:08:46] called from high society
[1:08:49] Paul was a learned man a student of
[1:08:51] Gamaliel he was exposed to the Finer
[1:08:54] Things and he learned how to live any
[1:08:56] Finer Things he learned how to he said I
[1:08:58] can become all all things to all men
[1:09:03] so yes he may come to church all sad
[1:09:05] because well this month my parent really
[1:09:07] woke up that good on you you know things
[1:09:09] you know things rough Paul came to the
[1:09:11] point that they couldn't tell when
[1:09:11] things was rough
[1:09:13] because he can do all things through
[1:09:15] Christ come on now who strengthens me
[1:09:18] Paul didn't feel entitled and would
[1:09:20] preach it
[1:09:21] because I'm an apostle God should not
[1:09:24] take me through summer basin
[1:09:26] that may not be right but they say but I
[1:09:27] want to drive the point home Paul wasn't
[1:09:29] saying well you know I'm a man of God so
[1:09:32] why are going through this
[1:09:33] that is the challenge of the entitlement
[1:09:36] so I want us to take the lesson from
[1:09:39] Paul tonight
[1:09:40] you know how many people say but why
[1:09:43] would whenever you ask the question why
[1:09:45] it is entitlement you're dealing with
[1:09:47] that's the issue
[1:09:49] the moment asks why this didn't work out
[1:09:52] it's because you felt entitled it should
[1:09:54] work in a certain way
[1:09:57] and Paul is saying I learned it
[1:10:00] and I want to drive home be learning the
[1:10:02] spiritual learning of our behaviors
[1:10:04] anybody with me tonight
[1:10:07] I just want to share a few more things
[1:10:08] and we'll have an early night tonight
[1:10:13] hmm
[1:10:18] somebody said for many people whatever
[1:10:21] makes them happy
[1:10:22] is what they believe they should be
[1:10:25] allowed to do
[1:10:27] I'll say it one more time
[1:10:29] for many people
[1:10:30] whatever makes them happy is what they
[1:10:33] believe they should be allowed to do
[1:10:39] and this could be any kind of thing
[1:10:41] they like to gossip they feel that so
[1:10:44] Gossip Girl is mean I feel happy they
[1:10:47] want okay I don't want to go around the
[1:10:49] list of things because you know what he
[1:10:50] list is
[1:10:52] but the Christian Life and this is why
[1:10:56] the entitlement is the problem because
[1:10:59] the Christian Life is a life of denial
[1:11:04] denying yourself so now we're driving
[1:11:06] home why this entitlementing is a
[1:11:08] problem because the entitlementing no
[1:11:10] means you feel you should have and God
[1:11:12] is saying you're suddenly you need to
[1:11:14] deny yourself
[1:11:18] so so when last have you denied yourself
[1:11:22] this is this is deep denying yourself is
[1:11:25] is so huge because you want to answer
[1:11:28] back your wife but you deny yourself
[1:11:31] the pleasure of answering back
[1:11:34] you want to say something to the boss
[1:11:36] where you deny yourself the pleasure
[1:11:38] that's how simple it is
[1:11:40] I'm a practical Christian
[1:11:42] I'm not trying to connect this to no
[1:11:44] deep mystery denying yourself means it's
[1:11:46] something that you want to do you like
[1:11:48] to do you enjoy doing but they put up
[1:11:51] breaks on it
[1:11:52] and you go against what you want to do
[1:11:55] because you can feel people tell it I'm
[1:11:57] entitled to my opinion are you are you
[1:11:59] really entitled to your own opinion as a
[1:12:01] child of God
[1:12:03] are you really entitled to your sin
[1:12:05] people come to church and come and talk
[1:12:07] about how they think it should be and
[1:12:09] everybody has a voice is that the kiss
[1:12:11] is that any word
[1:12:14] this is not trying to bring people into
[1:12:16] a state of Silence but it's
[1:12:17] understanding the context
[1:12:20] of what you really are entitled to
[1:12:24] and I will close all of the meeting with
[1:12:26] what you're supposed to be entitled to
[1:12:32] can we go a little further
[1:12:37] Our Lives should be focused not on what
[1:12:40] makes us happy now this goes against a
[1:12:42] lot of conventional thinking I'm not
[1:12:44] saying you're not supposed to be happy
[1:12:46] but this entitlement that you know
[1:12:49] seeking your happiness against the will
[1:12:52] of God is the issue because these
[1:12:54] children of Israel didn't see it as Sin
[1:12:57] this is what God got upset because a lot
[1:12:59] of us didn't see complaining our sin
[1:13:01] before I presented it this way
[1:13:04] you didn't see how God sees complaining
[1:13:08] because whenever you complain it is you
[1:13:10] throwing back whatever blessing God put
[1:13:12] for you and a provision well well a
[1:13:14] computer that I already wanted to make
[1:13:16] fifteen thousand and I only make 12 000
[1:13:18] I'm gonna sin but but is I will give any
[1:13:20] 12 so my my 12 are good
[1:13:24] well fine I'll take it all back
[1:13:27] I'll take it all because you there I I
[1:13:30] put things in place to give you 12
[1:13:32] because 12 is what you need and you they
[1:13:34] complaining you're gonna get 15 what you
[1:13:35] were fine well here's what I take him
[1:13:36] back my 12th
[1:13:39] or like he did with them you want 15
[1:13:42] I'll give you 15 till you tie yourself
[1:13:44] up and you lose yourself
[1:13:48] you're sick
[1:13:51] because it's it is really a level of it
[1:13:53] ended up being a level of ungratefulness
[1:13:56] all right let me try to bring a point to
[1:13:58] close out here now
[1:14:01] so
[1:14:06] we so I want to make the point then that
[1:14:08] that that there are a lot of people say
[1:14:10] well well since I'm a Christian I have a
[1:14:12] rougher life
[1:14:13] a tougher life
[1:14:16] and but Ibraham would say like this it's
[1:14:18] not a better roses it's not that it's
[1:14:20] not what does Christianity is but people
[1:14:22] come into Christianity and I think part
[1:14:24] of the challenge maybe how it is sold
[1:14:27] meaning how people present this journey
[1:14:31] because this is this is that this is a
[1:14:33] spiritual walk it's a walk with
[1:14:35] mountains and valleys and character
[1:14:36] development
[1:14:37] yes there's joy and enjoyed with only
[1:14:39] these strings but you cannot will Joy
[1:14:43] when going with the ticket to an
[1:14:45] experience to break something out of you
[1:14:46] and now you turn up your hands saying
[1:14:48] well well I taught this question what is
[1:14:50] joy and God is taking you through
[1:14:52] something
[1:14:53] to teach you how to be obese
[1:14:57] and teach you how to abound I don't know
[1:14:59] if this is helping anybody tonight
[1:15:06] we are not entitled
[1:15:08] to a certain standard of living
[1:15:13] I want to establish that
[1:15:16] yes God wants you to be happy yes God
[1:15:19] wants to be successful yes we want to be
[1:15:21] blessed but you are not entitled to that
[1:15:29] because God can decide what's teach and
[1:15:31] what house you living against whatever
[1:15:32] plans you have and you have to learn
[1:15:34] like Paul to say I have learned
[1:15:37] to deal with this because this is what
[1:15:39] God wants so I want us to see now
[1:15:42] your Ambitions and your plans have to be
[1:15:45] in alignment with God's will that is
[1:15:47] where the disconnect takes place
[1:15:49] it is futile for you to have ambition
[1:15:51] outside of the will of God
[1:15:55] now if you're ambition and that's why in
[1:15:58] all your ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:15:59] will direct your part he'll start to see
[1:16:01] how the dots connect
[1:16:03] because when you acknowledge Him and you
[1:16:05] seek his guidance and say Lord I only
[1:16:06] want what you want that is why Solomon
[1:16:08] could have been so blessed
[1:16:10] because he was seeking the wisdom of God
[1:16:13] he was seeking a mind of God to know how
[1:16:15] to live how to move how to act and God
[1:16:17] said that is what I want that's what
[1:16:19] really that's what I really want I want
[1:16:20] the heart that after my own heart a mind
[1:16:23] after my and I could bless you with
[1:16:25] anything because that is the principle
[1:16:26] thing
[1:16:29] not I'm a Christian I'm in a message I'm
[1:16:30] entitled into the Rapture so I'll go
[1:16:31] into the Rapture ho ho ho how are you
[1:16:34] doing it what are you working towards
[1:16:37] I want to challenge us
[1:16:40] to bring ourselves into a discipline of
[1:16:43] the word
[1:16:45] you are not entitled to your idea of the
[1:16:47] word
[1:16:48] you're not entitled to your
[1:16:50] interpretation of the word
[1:16:53] well I feel this is what it really means
[1:16:55] and I I don't like how that is said
[1:16:58] because that that that comes against
[1:16:59] what what somebody tell me people bring
[1:17:01] their entitlement of how they say the
[1:17:04] word you know
[1:17:06] and you will see through many of the
[1:17:08] Bible studies that we have done certain
[1:17:10] things that some people may have thought
[1:17:11] was a certain way when they see it
[1:17:13] through the word and say well wait a
[1:17:14] minute this is really what the scripture
[1:17:15] say and why it is said in that way
[1:17:18] anybody would meet you tonight I'm I'm
[1:17:20] almost done
[1:17:24] we are not entitled to the possession of
[1:17:27] others
[1:17:28] I was shared with my dad I said that is
[1:17:32] why horses run with blinders on
[1:17:37] because when a horse do have the
[1:17:40] blinders and he said to look at the
[1:17:41] other horses it's Madness going on
[1:17:45] so they put blinders so the singleness
[1:17:47] of focus to the finish line
[1:17:50] and I challenge you church and but over
[1:17:53] it was saying it on Sunday as well
[1:17:54] people carry Joyce with somebody else
[1:17:56] because they wish what a person had was
[1:17:58] their own
[1:17:59] so there's a kind of half Rejoice we're
[1:18:03] happy let's go happy Faith how we get
[1:18:06] that way
[1:18:08] is that a genuine it's not a truthful
[1:18:11] rejoicing no no it's a it's a kind of is
[1:18:13] that are happy and always I just want to
[1:18:16] be happier I would have been I'm happy
[1:18:18] for you but I want to be happier if I
[1:18:19] had it too
[1:18:23] so it's like degrees of Happiness so I'm
[1:18:26] happy but I want to be happier if we
[1:18:28] both got the car
[1:18:30] then we'll be total happiness we we
[1:18:32] won't we'll be really happy for each
[1:18:34] other
[1:18:35] and God is saying I am keeping you right
[1:18:37] where you at because I'm dealing with
[1:18:39] you differently
[1:18:41] so I want to challenge you that the word
[1:18:43] is the mirror
[1:18:45] that you want to be comparing to
[1:18:47] not anybody else
[1:18:52] anybody with me tonight I'm almost done
[1:18:58] you are not entitled to have in your any
[1:19:01] friend you want
[1:19:03] a coming out of young people now you're
[1:19:05] not entitled to choose
[1:19:07] Who Your Friends Are
[1:19:10] oh you thought it's your choice
[1:19:14] you're not entitled to marry who you
[1:19:16] want to marry
[1:19:17] uh-huh you thought it's your choice
[1:19:22] a lot of the things that people think
[1:19:25] they're entitled to they're not entitled
[1:19:27] to and they don't realize it because
[1:19:28] when you live by the world you realize
[1:19:30] witness I don't really have a choice
[1:19:32] about this
[1:19:34] do not be unequally yoked guys that
[1:19:37] deals with that situation you know
[1:19:40] you know what Abraham said under no
[1:19:42] circumstance I said a Believer Mario
[1:19:44] unbeliever
[1:19:47] uh-huh
[1:19:49] so what is your entitlement
[1:19:52] by the time we finish good on these
[1:19:54] roads friends it'll make you realize the
[1:19:56] moves that I thought I could make I
[1:19:57] already can't make enough
[1:19:59] anybody with me tonight
[1:20:02] I don't know if this is a little too
[1:20:04] much heat
[1:20:05] we are not entitled to our own
[1:20:08] interpretation of the truth
[1:20:11] you cannot this is not a buffet you
[1:20:14] cannot choose what you want out of the
[1:20:16] word and say well I believe I live in
[1:20:18] most this is the challenge when you meet
[1:20:20] somebody who doesn't have the revelation
[1:20:22] of the full word
[1:20:24] as a Christian artist Sigma gospel I I
[1:20:28] born again and and and anybody ever meet
[1:20:31] somebody like that
[1:20:36] little songs I sing good thing and and I
[1:20:40] born again I went to church two years
[1:20:42] ago and every year let's go and
[1:20:44] rededicate anything
[1:20:47] anybody ever meet anybody ever meet that
[1:20:50] and as far as that behavior is an
[1:20:52] entitlement that goes with it you know
[1:20:58] I was in a conversation a week ago I'm
[1:21:00] getting ready to close where somebody in
[1:21:04] the Pentecost I should say they find
[1:21:06] some preachers just make the
[1:21:07] requirements so high like you can't
[1:21:09] really go to heaven unless you do
[1:21:11] certain things
[1:21:12] I was like really
[1:21:13] [Laughter]
[1:21:18] you know you have to like change all
[1:21:20] your behaviors and change all your ways
[1:21:22] and you have to stop doing certain
[1:21:24] things so how you expect to go to heaven
[1:21:27] if it will change to be either because
[1:21:28] that behavior can't make it in heaven so
[1:21:31] I try to understand and to say and these
[1:21:33] preachers that want to be preaching as
[1:21:35] if as if all these behaviors like I love
[1:21:38] drinking can be too bad a lot you think
[1:21:41] and I say look hard
[1:21:44] and then but beyond that are coming out
[1:21:47] battle back to back to home back to home
[1:21:50] to these simple things because I was
[1:21:53] sharing it but over some time ago you
[1:21:55] know we would have gone through the
[1:21:57] story of nebot with Ahab and how Ahab
[1:22:01] looked at neighborhood property Vineyard
[1:22:03] and he gave him the offer he said I'll
[1:22:05] give you a better Vineyard or if you
[1:22:07] don't want another Vineyard I'll give
[1:22:08] any money to pay a fit and and and his
[1:22:12] anger I don't even remember the story
[1:22:13] ehar went home turned his face to the
[1:22:16] wall and then eat no food
[1:22:18] it wasn't his property and he gets so
[1:22:20] depressed he felt he was entitled to it
[1:22:23] he fell because of his position he was
[1:22:26] enticing and he felt that neighbor
[1:22:28] should have taken his offer so he was
[1:22:31] upset that neighbor didn't take the
[1:22:33] offer
[1:22:34] look that that's the case of
[1:22:35] entitlementer because if you don't feel
[1:22:37] entitled you should have no emotions
[1:22:40] but then you see entitlement is tied to
[1:22:43] comparison because he was looking at
[1:22:44] nearby privacy without that better
[1:22:46] looking like better than mine so I
[1:22:47] wanted it was also tight it covered him
[1:22:49] because he was coveted which means he
[1:22:51] wanted something
[1:22:53] he was coveted in his neighbor's
[1:22:54] property
[1:22:56] and they are scriptures in the New
[1:22:57] Testament that play that places coveted
[1:23:00] in the same category as adultery
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:16] every time you see him driving you just
[1:23:18] you can't deal with it
[1:23:21] and it you have to know your situation
[1:23:23] but then when God looks at it the same
[1:23:25] way you look at complaining you can say
[1:23:27] but I don't drink I don't smoke I in
[1:23:28] church but yeah they're complaining
[1:23:30] you're complaining they're complaining
[1:23:31] you're finding you're like you wake up
[1:23:33] baby then you're finding somebody what
[1:23:34] can I complain about today boy the roof
[1:23:37] all right let me complain about your
[1:23:38] roof your city roof your city roof you
[1:23:40] see the roof when you finish that day
[1:23:41] about the roof is you see the gates you
[1:23:43] see the gate you see the gate
[1:23:47] and God is in that attitude
[1:23:49] if somebody needs to be fixed fix it but
[1:23:52] don't complain about it
[1:23:54] if somebody could change changed it but
[1:23:56] complaining don't change anything
[1:23:59] and I want us to understand that this is
[1:24:01] something into certain behaviors
[1:24:04] people do already preach about these
[1:24:05] things and that's why citizens Bible
[1:24:07] study but I want us to understand when
[1:24:08] you look at and see how good chicken is
[1:24:10] most people never knew God judge them
[1:24:12] just for complaining
[1:24:15] people come to church they got seed they
[1:24:17] don't like two weeks later they still
[1:24:19] complain about a
[1:24:23] somebody get a bad Drive the whole rest
[1:24:26] of your drive it was it was a whatever
[1:24:27] bad Drive
[1:24:31] it's like every story stuck in Loop
[1:24:32] you're just repeating it you see that
[1:24:34] drive
[1:24:34] I fell out to be crazy and you go
[1:24:37] what manner of lives what manner of
[1:24:40] behavior ought me to be
[1:24:41] so I want to challenge us friends this
[1:24:44] Spirit of entitlement and I I pray that
[1:24:47] in some way it has been an encouragement
[1:24:48] to you
[1:24:50] the entitlement spiritual mentality is a
[1:24:54] threat to the contentment that Paul
[1:24:56] speaks about that comes with a
[1:24:59] relationship from God and trusting God
[1:25:01] to take care of you and your needs at a
[1:25:04] particular point in time
[1:25:07] you have to have trust in God
[1:25:10] yes there's actions you have to take but
[1:25:12] take it with prayer don't take it to all
[1:25:14] rush and you decide on what to do
[1:25:16] but take it with prayer and make sure at
[1:25:19] the end of the day you recognize that
[1:25:21] it's the grace of God to you is the
[1:25:24] grace of God to me it's the grace of God
[1:25:26] to us may the Lord bless us tonight can
[1:25:28] we just bow our heads if I would have
[1:25:31] prayed oh gracious Heavenly Father a
[1:25:33] simple
[1:25:34] Lord thought to just follow Sunday's
[1:25:36] message Lord and Lord to praying that in
[1:25:40] some way something would have been said
[1:25:42] tonight to help your people Lord to stay
[1:25:45] focused on the word and the impact of
[1:25:47] the world and their lives Lord and to
[1:25:50] see Lord how you looked at entitlement
[1:25:53] and complaining and all these things and
[1:25:56] it's so displeasure that with it father
[1:25:58] you brought judgment Lord you granted
[1:26:01] the desires of people and in it was
[1:26:03] judgment that is such a paradox to try
[1:26:06] the law to understand your thinking on
[1:26:07] the matter but to see how how you are so
[1:26:11] distilled when you have blessed us in so
[1:26:13] many ways and yet still we can't find
[1:26:15] words of gratitude to Thank You Lord
[1:26:18] help us to have a grateful heart help us
[1:26:21] to be thankful and appreciative and to
[1:26:23] lean to you father Lord as our sources
[1:26:26] our strength in all our ways to
[1:26:28] acknowledge you father Lord and to keep
[1:26:31] you first in what we do may you bless
[1:26:33] your people tonight too absolutely
[1:26:34] Faithfully come out here tonight and
[1:26:37] help us Lord to not take it for granted
[1:26:39] help us Lord to make our calling and
[1:26:41] election show May you bless each one
[1:26:43] will you bless our pastor in a special
[1:26:45] way and blessed Lord a Ministry that
[1:26:47] rallies around to give support and to
[1:26:49] share the burden the responsibility Lord
[1:26:51] may you bless everyone in this room
