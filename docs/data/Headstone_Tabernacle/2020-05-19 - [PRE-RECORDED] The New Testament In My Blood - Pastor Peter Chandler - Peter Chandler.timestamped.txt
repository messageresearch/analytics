[59:10] comes just a few thoughts - sure just a
[59:12] few words on the Branham we're speaking
[59:14] about the token and said pastor Moses
[59:17] spoke and said you have got to get
[59:18] beneath the blood for God said blood as
[59:21] a token it's a token no matter how much
[59:23] you believe how much you're circumcised
[59:25] that's the covenant God gave to Abraham
[59:28] and so forth
[59:29] that's the covenant but you've got to
[59:31] get beneath the blood that's the token
[59:33] when I see the Blood I will pass
[59:36] that's the nomination either one you
[59:38] must come beneath the blood Methodist
[59:41] Baptist Presbyterian and the costal on
[59:45] denomination whatever you are it's for
[59:49] an individual you've got to come beneath
[59:52] the blood not just to talk about it may
[59:55] I use his words all outside of Christ
[59:58] will perish how do you get into Christ
[1:00:01] first Corinthians 12 by one spirit not
[1:00:05] by one handshake not by one membership
[1:00:08] but not by one denomination that's what
[1:00:12] they're trying to make it but by one
[1:00:14] spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:00:17] and if an angel from heaven teaches
[1:00:21] anything else
[1:00:22] Paul said let him be at least that's the
[1:00:26] message come into Christ look any person
[1:00:30] outside of the token God was not
[1:00:32] responsible and God is not responsible
[1:00:34] for any person big or small popular or
[1:00:37] unpopular rich or poor bond or free male
[1:00:40] or female he is not responsible for
[1:00:42] anyone from under that token covenant
[1:00:45] he's not responsible you say lord I did
[1:00:48] this I cast out Devils I preached the
[1:00:49] gospel depart from me you not work
[1:00:52] iniquity I never knew you
[1:00:53] he only recognized a token do you hear
[1:00:56] the coalition said amen
[1:00:58] so now it's upon you he said sitting
[1:01:01] down in the woods the other day the boys
[1:01:03] was wondering here's two days I even
[1:01:05] didn't even shoot a squirrel they said
[1:01:07] what was the matter see what it was he
[1:01:09] said please sit upon them said no longer
[1:01:13] was the burden of the Prophet it was the
[1:01:15] burden of the people to begin to apply
[1:01:17] the token
[1:01:19] he's a play set upon them no it is in
[1:01:21] your lap it's in yours he won't
[1:01:23] recognize nothing but that covenant of
[1:01:25] the Holy Spirit and you cannot receive
[1:01:27] that covenant unless you are saved
[1:01:29] sanctified and then baptized into the
[1:01:32] body you only recognize the token that's
[1:01:35] the message of the hour that's the
[1:01:37] message of this day that's the message
[1:01:39] of this train in the name of Jesus
[1:01:41] receive it God is your joy God is your
[1:01:44] strength knowing the message knowing the
[1:01:48] truth that's our sufficiency he's my all
[1:01:50] sufficiency in him all things I have
[1:01:52] needed in him that's our strength my
[1:01:54] he'll come from the Lord you Christians
[1:01:56] look to him for your joy look to him for
[1:01:59] your strength look to him for your
[1:02:01] happiness he is my peace he is my joy
[1:02:04] he's my love he is my life that's the
[1:02:09] Covenant
[1:02:10] remember only safe when the token was
[1:02:14] displayed and if a man was here under
[1:02:17] here and his son was across the street
[1:02:18] he was in danger he would perish his
[1:02:21] daddy would be saved or if their son was
[1:02:23] over here and as daddy was over there
[1:02:25] his daddy would perish only the token
[1:02:27] when I see the token I will pass over
[1:02:30] you that's the only thing less horse
[1:02:32] town is gonna bring God's servant to the
[1:02:33] platform praise God through the blood

[1:47:43] this was the body hallelujah and he
[1:47:47] ripped it apart at Calvary his bleeding
[1:47:50] wounded spear ripped him apart but blood
[1:47:55] gushed out a man and he bowed his head

[1:49:32] forever but he sent that spirit that he
[1:49:36] taught out of the body right back down
[1:49:40] upon the church
[1:49:41] and that church will have to have the
[1:49:46] same spirit that was in that body or it
