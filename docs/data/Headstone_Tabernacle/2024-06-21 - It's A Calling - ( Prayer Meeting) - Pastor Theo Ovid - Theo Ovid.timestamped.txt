[2:11] tonight in a special way in Jesus name I
[2:13] ask it amen amen God bless you and it is
[2:16] great to be here we have had perion for
[2:18] a while and we want to do that tonight
[2:21] and then I have something very short I
[2:24] like to share with you and it's have a
[2:27] scripture I like to read that scripture
[2:29] is taken from
[2:30] 2 Peter 1 verse 10 2 Peter 1 vers
[2:36] 10 and it says here wherefore the rather
[2:40] Brethren give diligence to make your
[2:44] calling an election show but if you do
[2:48] these things it shall never fall make
[2:52] your core election sure and I a sort of
[2:56] thought here it's a
[2:58] calling it's a calling that same
[3:01] scripture 2 Peter 1 10 in the Amplified
[3:06] it says this because of this
[3:09] Brethren be all more Sol
[3:13] solicitous and eager to make sure to
[3:18] ratify to
[3:20] strengthen to make
[3:23] steadfast your calling and election for
[3:27] if you do this you will never stumble
[3:30] or fall you know I was thinking about
[3:32] this scripture and I was thinking
[3:35] about election and calling and he
[3:38] thought different things and I was
[3:41] thinking you know like a child born into
[3:43] a home that child didn't asked to belong
[3:47] to that home or to be born of that
[3:49] family that child has been elected to be
[3:52] in that family so say you have a child
[3:55] or children and these are your children
[3:59] and yet when they start to grow they
[4:01] start to mature you have to they have to
[4:05] be guided as to what career what job and
[4:08] that's where your hand is in molding and
[4:11] shaping and directing their lives and
[4:14] their response to what you share and to
[4:18] how you present things you know it could
[4:21] have a positive effect or negative
[4:23] effect and I'm thinking in my mind you
[4:26] know sometimes your mind going a bit and
[4:29] I'm thinking a mother or father calling
[4:31] a son hey Johnny
[4:33] come and Johnny don't want to
[4:36] come now you can't deny him belonging to
[4:40] the family but he's not responding to
[4:43] the call the call of God and there are
[4:47] so many people and I see back Brethren
[4:51] over the years and they always
[4:53] prophesying to themselves in their own
[4:55] imagination I'll come back I'll come
[4:57] back and I I'm a son I'm a seed elected
[5:00] and that kind of and all that is just
[5:02] talk because this scripture about make
[5:05] it cor let show is to ratify or to
[5:10] confirm exactly that because if you are
[5:14] elected you would respond to the call of
[5:18] God it's a call in other words say for
[5:22] example tonight tonight we are in a PR
[5:25] whether you feel to pray or not that is
[5:26] not the part we deal with we dealing
[5:29] with what this is tonight and what we
[5:31] are called to do tonight if you don't
[5:35] respond to the call to talk to God
[5:38] tonight then you know you have to wonder
[5:41] what have you been elected onto because
[5:44] you see the election is in God we don't
[5:48] touch the Nubs of election we don't
[5:51] press those buttons God does and when
[5:54] God have election in mind he has
[5:57] predestination in mind that's why the
[6:00] Bible said it this way who he for you he
[6:02] called so his for knowledge of us give
[6:07] him the ability to elect us and call us
[6:11] out of our sinful condition because
[6:14] that's what we were in onto a purpose
[6:17] and sometimes as humans we drop down and
[6:21] live in this human realm without seeking
[6:25] and Desiring to know what is that
[6:28] purpose at the end of the day if we live
[6:32] go to church come back home meet people
[6:36] uh buy car house get married whatever it
[6:39] is get old and dirty we are living just
[6:42] like anybody else on
[6:43] canat because that's what everybody does
[6:47] they live they have children they get
[6:48] married they have jobs they get old and
[6:51] so on like and they
[6:52] die but this end time church and this
[6:57] end time people have the highest calling
[7:01] ever given to a people on the Earth this
[7:05] Gentile Bri because just imagine when he
[7:08] said he came unto his own his own
[7:09] receive him not and the turn have to
[7:13] switch from the Jews to the Gentiles out
[7:15] of which Christ gets a bride then he is
[7:19] looking to the response of this Divine
[7:23] call now when God call you or I could
[7:27] say when God chose you
[7:30] he chose you to unexpected
[7:32] end he chose you that you could make it
[7:36] he have confidence that if you do what
[7:39] you're supposed to do and act how you're
[7:41] supposed to act you will make it Jesus
[7:43] told his own disciples if you love me
[7:47] you will keep my Commandments and my my
[7:49] father we would love you and we will
[7:51] manifest ourselves to you it wasn't an
[7:54] automatic thing it was some conditions
[7:57] tying to their predestination or
[8:00] we know how Jesus prayed he said father
[8:03] that they may be one as we are one and
[8:05] so Jesus prayed that prayer and yet he
[8:08] knew that Peter was going to backslide
[8:10] and yet he knew that Peter was going
[8:13] going to go in the power of self he knew
[8:16] that and Jesus didn't despise Peter
[8:19] because he knew this this flesh man he
[8:23] he he understood that the spirit is
[8:25] willing but the flesh is weak but at
[8:28] some point in time we have to get this
[8:32] realization that not only are we elected
[8:35] but we are called to do something if you
[8:39] just throw election up in the air I'm
[8:41] elected you're smoking but you're
[8:43] elected you're fooling WR but you're
[8:45] elected that doesn't make any sense God
[8:48] doesn't run his business that you are
[8:50] elected unto a purpose and part of the
[8:53] purpose is on to prayer a call to prayer
[8:59] not a call for somebody to pray for you
[9:03] this what a lot of us pray for me pray
[9:06] for me pray for me and you not praying
[9:07] for yourself I'm not praying for nobody
[9:10] but you have to recognize it is a
[9:13] calling I was feeling extremely tired
[9:17] tonight but you know what I have a
[9:21] calling I have
[9:23] responsibility I saw when G started to
[9:25] play something wasn't right and I know
[9:28] you know when I check and what's
[9:30] happening now I something wasn't right
[9:32] and I have a choice press on or just
[9:36] stick because it's not working out as we
[9:39] expect tonight but what we choose to do
[9:41] is to press decisions are
[9:44] great it's a joy to be a decision
[9:48] maker it doesn't make any sense not
[9:51] making decisions and not making
[9:53] decisions is to make a decision not to
[9:55] make a
[9:56] decision make a decision to accept your
[9:59] call Jesus told disciples plainly you
[10:02] have not chosen me but I've chosen you
[10:06] then what are you going to do
[10:07] about what are you going to do about
[10:10] this call that you have there are some
[10:13] of
[10:13] us we we we wasn't born with the gift of
[10:17] fatherhood or the gift of being a great
[10:19] husband that was not the gift there is
[10:22] no gift as that there's no gift as such
[10:25] we learn we feel we stick we fall short
[10:31] but that doesn't mean we cannot learn
[10:34] that doesn't mean we cannot grow that
[10:36] doesn't mean we cannot teach because if
[10:39] you fail as a father or as a wife or as
[10:42] a husband or as a mother you could still
[10:45] learn stuff to teach others that they
[10:49] wouldn't do what you do or act how you
[10:51] act and you'll grow into
[10:53] maturity this is the purpose of God and
[10:56] sometime I go I preach a message upon
[10:57] not just about salvation but Christian
[10:59] maturity Christian grw them because
[11:01] Jesus grew in knowledge and wisdom and
[11:03] understanding God expect that from us in
[11:06] other words the teacher that teaches any
[11:09] class Any teacher you could ask and we
[11:11] have teachers Among Us they feel great
[11:14] when the children do well and they move
[11:15] on so the form one teacher feel great
[11:18] the child move on to form two the form
[11:20] teacher and this is the the students
[11:24] they make the teachers proud when they
[11:27] perform as they supposed to perform
[11:29] let's switch it to God now what did Bam
[11:32] says the Holy Spirit sent out reports
[11:37] God is asking how is my son doing what's
[11:39] the report on him
[11:41] well was in church and know next in
[11:44] church again and well he's not making
[11:47] any stand well he's not making any
[11:50] sacrifice he's not doing anything he
[11:53] just believe a son that's it that's all
[11:56] yes we have that too but what is the c
[11:59] in about this election so let me
[12:02] just uh I just give a backdrop there let
[12:05] me just get something here Ephesians 1
[12:08] says according as he has chosen in him
[12:11] before the foundation of the world that
[12:13] we should be holy Without Blame before
[12:15] in love having predestinated us unto the
[12:18] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[12:20] himself according to good
[12:22] pleasure Romans
[12:25] 9 verse 11 says for the children not not
[12:30] yet born neither have done any good or
[12:33] evil that the purpose of God according
[12:37] to election might stand not a work but
[12:39] of him that call it it was said unto her
[12:42] the Elder Shall Serve the younger and is
[12:45] it written Jacob have I love but Esau
[12:48] have I note that both Esau and Jacob
[12:53] have absolutely nothing to do with this
[12:56] calling that God put here he said the
[12:58] calling
[13:01] according to the election might stand
[13:03] not of works but him that call it and
[13:06] the last one of yeah last one in this is
[13:09] 2 Peter 1:10 that we read wherefore the
[13:12] rather bre give give diligence to make a
[13:15] calling an election sure for if you do
[13:18] these things you shall never fall never
[13:23] fall now and we have a few SC on calling
[13:27] it won't be long with you Romans 8
[13:29] from script 28 for we know all things
[13:33] work together for good to them that here
[13:35] we go love God do you love him to them
[13:39] who are be called according to his
[13:42] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[13:45] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[13:47] image of his son that he might be the
[13:49] first born among many Brethren moreover
[13:51] whom he did predestinate they he also
[13:53] called whom he called they he also
[13:56] justify and whom he justified they also
[13:59] glorified now if we take this scripture
[14:02] at St value it
[14:05] finished because we
[14:06] elected called Justified glorified
[14:11] finish we can go home now and relax that
[14:15] is not how it works that middle part
[14:18] there that is not written the part of
[14:21] sanctification the part of sacrifice the
[14:24] part of labor labor to enter stride
[14:27] towards this promise that part is a part
[14:30] God expect us to do and guess what God
[14:33] can't do it for
[14:34] us when the Bible
[14:37] says
[14:39] uh like in consecrating yourself or um
[14:44] Romans 12 and so on like that when the
[14:46] Bible speaks about these things about
[14:49] you um becoming and you beholding his
[14:53] face and you being changed and
[14:54] transformed God cannot do the part that
[14:56] you have to play in that regard that is
[14:59] why you come to hear the word why
[15:02] because you will learn of him the word
[15:05] will teach you because we have our own
[15:07] will and our will have to come in
[15:09] subject to his will okay almost done few
[15:12] more we finish all right now 2 Timothy
[15:17] 1:9 says who had saved us and called us
[15:20] with a holy calling not according to our
[15:23] works but according to his own purpose
[15:26] and Grace which was given to us in
[15:29] Christ Jesus before the world began and
[15:32] the last scripture in this section is 1
[15:34] Peter 2:9 but he have chosen generation
[15:37] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[15:41] peculiar people that you should here we
[15:43] go show forth the Praises of him who had
[15:47] called you out of Darkness into this
[15:49] marvelous land let's go this is a
[15:53] calling time for the BR it's a
[15:56] separating time when the cha and the
[15:59] wheat is to be separated and Al though
[16:02] the wheat has been wrapped in the Sha
[16:04] but now it's calling out time it's
[16:07] another
[16:08] Excellence so has the gospel and the
[16:10] power of almighty God has spread around
[16:13] the world and the separation time is now
[16:18] taking place when God is calling a bride
[16:23] and the devil is calling a church let me
[16:27] be part of the Bride that's what says
[16:30] let me be part of the BR let's continue
[16:36] the life the stalk there Carri the life
[16:39] certainly did but you see it become the
[16:42] St and it was finished the organization
[16:45] the life went on into Wesley it come
[16:47] right out one big blade do look like the
[16:51] green didn't Jesus in the last day says
[16:54] the two would be so close it would
[16:56] receive the very genes the predestinated
[16:58] elected
[16:59] it was possible he said now watch it's
[17:02] weak time it's getting Harvest Time this
[17:06] is not Luther's age this is not
[17:08] Pentecostal age this is the bride age
[17:12] and here we go as Moses called a nation
[17:14] out of a Nation Christ today is calling
[17:18] a church out of a church so friends is a
[17:23] calling that is going on last quote we
[17:26] have God wants his people to pray and
[17:30] when Israel got so taxed in such a
[17:33] condition that they could not go any
[17:35] further their time was fulfilled and
[17:38] their burden lay farther than what they
[17:40] thought then they begin to pray and when
[17:43] the people begin to pray then God begin
[17:47] to hear it was time for God's word to be
[17:51] fulfilled so when amam and Jose saw it
[17:56] was time for the word to be fulfilled
[17:59] they went to pray to God and it is
[18:02] usually those who pray is the one who
[18:06] got the burden and the one who gets
[18:09] something it is those who pray and hear
[18:12] this part that's
[18:14] ordained of God to do so
[18:19] inclosing I want to tell you it's a
[18:22] calling it's a call to pray it's a call
[18:26] to cry out it's a call to seek his face
[18:30] it's a call to ask it's a call to plead
[18:35] it's a call to
[18:38] intercede make your calling an election
[18:42] show right now as we hit the home
[18:47] stret those that catch the vision will
[18:51] have a
[18:52] burden of being in relationship with
[18:56] God people will call upon God you
[18:59] but when condition
[19:01] Ares for 50 years Saudi Arabia had an
[19:06] agreement with America that oil will be
[19:09] purchased in US
[19:10] dollar that agreement ended I believe
[19:13] the 7th of June and Saudi Arabia is
[19:17] not uh going and restore or renew that
[19:22] agreement what it means is that by this
[19:27] by oil which is the energy that the
[19:30] world was pumping by all along it held
[19:33] the US dollar as a reserve
[19:35] currency it is no longer it's heading
[19:38] now where it will no longer be so
[19:40] because people could buy oil in rupees
[19:44] in the Chinese currency and in in the
[19:47] Russian currency in whatever currency
[19:50] things are
[19:52] changing and if you think for one moment
[19:55] that because it's not in your country
[19:57] doesn't affect you you are wrong things
[20:00] are changing everywhere and we have to
[20:03] be concerned with not just the external
[20:07] that is happening but the internal about
[20:11] us I want to challenge you to be concern
[20:15] about you you and your burden what is
[20:18] your burden tonight what is your concern
[20:21] tonight many are called but few are
[20:25] chosen be one of these chosen ones
[20:28] tonight that is called to pray if you
[20:30] are
[20:31] backsliding ask God to
[20:34] restore if you are in a condition ask
[20:36] God to deliver you if you are sick ask
[20:40] God to heal you you're not here to say
[20:43] words you're here to honor God God
[20:46] didn't call you out for you to remain in
[20:48] that Miss God called you out that you
[20:51] could walk in the light why would Jesus
[20:54] tell the woman go and sin no more
[20:56] because I forgive you now she could run
[20:58] and say he forgive me that's s to do let
[21:02] me go and sin and I'll go back again
[21:04] no the call out is that you will not go
[21:08] back the way you
[21:10] were let us bow our
[21:12] heads heavenly father I thank you for
[21:15] tonight I thank you for this opportunity
[21:18] to share these words with your people
[21:20] it's a
[21:21] calling a
[21:23] calling I remember that call upon my own
[21:27] life it was it was
[21:31] something I just had to do it I had to
[21:35] respond I had to get baptized I had to
[21:39] serve you I had to drop the girlfriend I
[21:42] had to drop everything to follow Jesus
[21:46] oh God May a first love strike your
[21:49] people tonight May the opportunity to
[21:53] get right with God the opportunity to
[21:54] get reconciled May stke the heart
[21:56] tonight May something come a fresh
[21:59] break off the staleness break off the
[22:01] largy break off the sluggishness and may
[22:05] a new expectation Aris in their hearts
[22:09] to love and to serve you granted tonight
[22:12] Lord those prophets words are so
[22:13] precious that those who have a burden to
[22:15] pray those who have a burden they pray
[22:17] and as they pray they get back a burden
[22:20] so is it that when we see people without
[22:22] a burden it means that something is not
[22:24] there they're not praying because
[22:26] there's no burden there we have children
[22:29] Lord we have grandchildren Lord we have
