[15:27] Glory to God.
[15:30] Oh, we have a desire tonight. One thing
[15:33] have I
[15:34] desired that will I seek after tonight.
[15:38] Oh, make us and mold us, Father, into
[15:42] your image, oh God. Wrap us in your holy
[15:45] arms, oh God. We leave it all behind
[15:49] Lord to follow the

[15:55] Hallelujah. Oh we do not know the
[15:58] way. Oh help us
[16:01] tonight. Oh mighty God. Oh hallelujah.
[16:06] Hallelujah.
[16:08] Oh
[16:09] hallelujah. Glory to God. We thank you
[16:11] for your presence tonight Lord. Amen. We
[16:15] are overwhelmed by you tonight, Lord
[16:17] Jesus.
[16:18] Thank you, Father. Hallelujah.
[16:21] Amen.
[16:23] Praise God. God bless you. You
[16:25] appreciate the Lord
[16:26] tonight.
[16:28] Amen. Praise God. Another holy time is
[16:32] coming. We believe by faith is here
[16:35] tonight. God bless
[16:37] you. If you have your Bibles, you'd like
[16:39] to turn to Psalm chapter 121 for a
[16:42] scripture reading.
[16:44] Praise God.
[16:45] Amen. Psalms chapter
[16:49] 121.
[16:53] Amen. Uh the volume
[16:57] uh I think volume might be a little bit
[16:58] too high on the microphone. So you could
[17:00] just check
[17:02] that. Psalms
[17:05] 121. It says, "I will lift up mine eyes
[17:08] unto the
[17:09] hills from whence cometh my help."
[17:12] Hallelujah. My help cometh from the
[17:14] Lord, which made heaven and earth. He
[17:18] will not suffer thy foot to be moved. He
[17:21] that keepeth thee will not slumber.
[17:24] Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall
[17:26] neither slumber nor sleep. For the Lord
[17:30] is thy keeper, and the Lord is thy shade
[17:34] upon thy right hand. The sun shall not
[17:37] smite thee by day, nor the moon by
[17:40] night. The Lord shall preserve thee from
[17:44] all evil. He shall preserve thy soul.
[17:48] The Lord shall preserve thy going out
[17:50] and thy coming in from this time forth
[17:54] and even forever more. May God add
[17:57] blessing to the reading of his word. Let
[18:00] us lift our hands and pray unto the Lord
[18:02] as we ask his blessings tonight upon
[18:05] this service.
[18:07] Almighty God, we are uh captivated Lord
[18:11] by your presence. Father, we humbly bow
[18:15] before you Lord. We uh know that you are
[18:18] greater Father. There's something in us
[18:21] tonight,
[18:22] Lord, that is drawing us to you, dear
[18:25] God. We care to answer that call
[18:28] tonight. A call in our hearts,
[18:31] Lord. We want to be a Christian.
[18:34] So, Father, may you pour into us, Lord,
[18:36] your presence, your spirit, your
[18:40] anointing. Help us, Lord, and teach us
[18:42] as we sit, Lord, as we gather around
[18:45] your feet, Lord, that you would help us
[18:48] and instruct us along the way, Father,
[18:50] by your word. May your spirit also come,
[18:53] Father, and confirm that word, Lord, and
[18:56] make it alive, Lord, in the hearts of
[18:59] your children tonight, Lord. We are
[19:01] nothing, Lord, without you, Lord. You
[19:03] are everything to us, Lord. So, Father,
[19:06] may you come and anoint your the
[19:08] service. Anoint the songs that we would
[19:10] sing as we offer it up before you as as
[19:13] incense and as worship before you, Lord.
[19:15] And we pray that your presence would
[19:17] come, Lord. May he bless the your
[19:19] servant, Lord God, as he would yield
[19:21] himself to be used of you, dear God. May
[19:24] you take the word of God, Lord, and go
[19:26] pass all feelings, Father. Go pass every
[19:29] every other thing, every other obstacle,
[19:32] Lord. here. Meet us at the point of our
[19:34] need. Oh God, we surrender to you
[19:36] tonight and this service we surrender to
[19:38] you tonight, dear God. May you have your
[19:40] way in it. May you be glorified in our
[19:43] midst in Jesus Christ's precious name.

[34:17] Oh, we thank you for that word on
[34:19] Sunday. Father, our eyes are thrilled
[34:21] and excited to know that a great work is
[34:25] being done and nothing must hinder that
[34:27] work. Nothing must hinder that walk,
[34:30] that walk in God. Bless your word. Take
[34:33] me out of the way and be glorified
[34:35] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[34:37] God bless you and welcome. If you have
[34:39] your Bibles out, you turn to Matthew
[34:41] chapter
[34:42] 15. We want to read verse 22- 28. And
[34:46] from 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, we have
[34:48] one verse there, verse 18. So reading
[34:52] Matthew chapter
[34:55] 15, reading from verse
[34:59] 22. And behold, a woman of Canaan came
[35:02] out of the same coast and cried unto
[35:06] him, saying, Have mercy on me, oh Lord,
[35:09] thou son of
[35:10] David. My daughter is grievously vexed
[35:14] with the devil. And he but he answered
[35:17] her not a word. And his disciples came
[35:21] and besought him, saying, Send her away,
[35:23] for she cried after us.
[35:26] But he answered and said, I am not sent
[35:30] but unto the Lord sheep of the house of
[35:33] Israel. Then came she and worshiped him,
[35:36] saying, Lord, help me. But he answered
[35:40] and said, "It is not meat to take the
[35:43] children's bread and to cast it to
[35:46] dogs." And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet
[35:50] the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[35:53] their master's table.
[35:56] Then Jesus answered and said unto her,
[35:59] "Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it
[36:03] unto thee, even as thou wilt." And her
[36:06] daughter was made whole from that very
[36:09] hour. I'll reading from 1 Thessalonians
[36:11] chapter 2. I want to read verse 18.
[36:16] Paul
[36:18] speaks, "Wherefore we would have come
[36:21] unto you, even I, Paul, once and again,
[36:26] but Satan hindered us." Let's bow ahead
[36:29] one more, Father. Father, we have read
[36:30] your word, and I pray it be edifying and
[36:33] strengthening. And Lord, may a
[36:36] revelation break upon your people
[36:37] tonight. Confirm your word with signs,
[36:40] wonders, and miracles. We ask in Jesus
[36:42] name. Amen. Amen. And God bless you.
[36:44] Have Have your seat. Hallelujah. Amen.
[36:51] I really felt blessed on Sunday.
[36:55] That message certainly appreciated it.
[36:59] I'm doing a great work.
[37:02] I I can't come down. I can't come down.
[37:08] That is another level because that
[37:11] brings a consciousness of the work that
[37:13] you're called to do and what you're
[37:15] doing. So tonight I want to have a title
[37:19] hindrances. Just one word hindrances.
[37:24] What is hindering
[37:26] you and what hindrance is affecting you
[37:30] the most?
[37:32] And I just want to connect with Sunday
[37:36] service Nemiah 6:3. I sent messengers
[37:39] unto them saying, I am doing a great
[37:41] work so I cannot come down. Why should
[37:44] the work cease whilst I leave it and
[37:48] come down to you? So I'll get this
[37:51] hindrances. Hindrance. Nehemiah is one
[37:53] of the stories that showcase hindrances
[37:56] to the Lord's work in rebuilding
[37:59] Jerusalem war.
[38:01] And these are some of the hindrances.
[38:04] External opposition, fear,
[38:08] discouragement, distractions, and even
[38:10] internal strife. And whenever, this is
[38:14] some things I wrote. Whenever you are in
[38:16] the kingdom business, building, building
[38:20] up God's word, building up the statue of
[38:23] a perfect man with vision and purpose,
[38:26] walking in the will of God, you must
[38:29] expect resistance,
[38:31] but don't come down.
[38:34] Don't come down.
[38:37] Stay in prayer.
[38:39] Stay on guard and stay focused.
[38:43] Three things here. prayer on God and
[38:46] focus because this is how Nemiah was
[38:49] able to get past the hindrances before
[38:50] him. I like the part that he got
[38:53] strategy as to how to set people to have
[38:56] their sword on one hand and but and a
[38:59] trouble on the next hand. He had a
[39:02] strategy. The enemy want to come, the
[39:04] enemy want to attack. We're not going to
[39:06] say we working and we like we we stupid
[39:07] working and we don't understand the
[39:09] attack coming. No, you're you're working
[39:11] on your fighting. You're working on your
[39:13] unexpectation. You're working on your
[39:14] sword. We're not fools. We are under
[39:17] assault.
[39:19] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. And I
[39:21] want to show you tonight and I hope you
[39:24] catch it. There are all kind of forces
[39:26] to hinder us. And Paul talk about he
[39:29] wanted to come to them, but Satan
[39:30] hindered me. So there are spiritual
[39:32] opposition. There are spiritual forces.
[39:35] There are more things that going on
[39:36] around you that you don't even know. But
[39:39] we have to understand the the the
[39:40] devices of the enemy. And overcome them
[39:43] all. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[39:47] So Nema response to the attacks and
[39:50] everything else. In verse 9, he said,
[39:52] "We made our prayers to God." Amen.
[39:55] Amen. Remember, they are not warriors,
[39:57] you know. They're not fighters, you
[39:59] know. Near is a cup bearer. He's not a
[40:01] general ne. He come because he had a
[40:04] burden in his heart to see things built
[40:06] back to see things restored. God help us
[40:09] in this message. But Abraham came with a
[40:12] burden. God tell him go get that bride.
[40:14] There has to be a restoration of the
[40:17] original itself. But somehow people get
[40:19] away from what has to be restored.
[40:22] Restore me. It was once there before.
[40:24] It's not something new, you know. We're
[40:26] going back to the faith of the fathers.
[40:29] Oh, give the Lord a shout. It's not a
[40:31] new something spinning in the air. The
[40:33] only thing added is the rapture, a
[40:35] change of the body in time. But other
[40:38] than that is the same faith the father
[40:39] has had. Oh, glory to God. The father
[40:42] was out timing to go in the rapture
[40:44] because we had to be here. We had to
[40:46] come. But we are here for a body of
[40:49] people to leave this earth. Oh, give the
[40:51] Lord a praise in this house.
[40:55] So Nemiah Nemiah he had with them with a
[40:58] sword in one hand and the tool in the
[41:00] other and also he had discernment
[41:05] that character that was paid to come to
[41:08] prophesy lions I hear you want to be
[41:10] king I hear you send not prophets and
[41:12] what a line anointing upon him know and
[41:14] that was a meeting in church them people
[41:17] fear God you know but Nehemiah was
[41:20] focused I'm doing a great work and I
[41:23] cannot come
[41:24] Hallelujah. Because he had a burden to
[41:27] rebuild the house of God, to rebuild the
[41:29] wall. Isn't that right? All right. Now,
[41:32] hear the bomb coming out. Now, the
[41:33] church is to be rebuilt by the power of
[41:36] the spirit according to the prophecy in
[41:39] the message of grace. Oh, glory to God.
[41:41] So, we have some building to do. Oh,
[41:44] glory to God. We have a fight. No demon,
[41:47] no devil, and go just let us rebuild the
[41:48] church in the power of the spirit. There
[41:50] are people pinned down in deadness
[41:52] inside the churches. Can't even shout,
[41:54] no praise, no worship, no nothing.
[41:56] They're paralyzed by demons and devils,
[41:58] religious spirits in this message. But
[42:00] we come to bust that tonight. You have
[42:02] to bust that in the tabernacle. You have
[42:04] to bust that in your life. There must be
[42:06] no hindrances there all together. Oh,
[42:09] glory to God. A hindrance is no praise
[42:11] demon. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Let me
[42:13] say it good. A hindrance is no praise
[42:15] demon. the demons that making you not to
[42:18] praise God because God is the object of
[42:20] worship. That is what makes him God.
[42:22] You're coming to parade your beef or
[42:23] your flesh. You're coming to give God
[42:25] glory. Jesus said, "Woman, the hour now
[42:27] is when the true worshippers could
[42:29] worship the father in spirit and truth."
[42:31] This message supposed to have true
[42:33] worshippers, not dead still believers.
[42:36] Oh, give the Lord a shout. This message
[42:38] is the message to have real worship.
[42:42] Glory to God. We should worship. Shame
[42:44] the Pentecostal. Shame the Methodist.
[42:46] Shame the Baptist. Praise God. You must
[42:48] wonder how we could worship like that.
[42:50] We know what we worship. We know who we
[42:52] worship. We know why we worship. We come
[42:54] from God. We're going back to God. Oh,
[42:56] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[42:59] Hallelujah. Rain and no rain. Bad
[43:01] weather. I don't know. Bad weather. We
[43:02] in the house and give God praise. I
[43:04] don't give a storm come tonight. We in
[43:06] the house and give God praise. You don't
[43:08] even know what's going to be started.
[43:10] You don't even know what's about to
[43:11] happen tonight. But devil may know what
[43:13] hindrance is. We're going to rebuild a
[43:15] house. We're going to build a revival.
[43:17] We're going to build a glorious church
[43:19] without spot or wrinkle. Oh glory. You
[43:22] are the temple of the Holy Ghost. We're
[43:23] going to build virtue and knowledge and
[43:25] temperance and patience. No more
[43:27] hindrances. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[43:30] Don't let your wife hinder you. Don't
[43:32] let your husband hinder you. Don't let
[43:33] the dog in your yard hinder you. Oh,
[43:36] give the Lord a shout. Glory to God.
[43:38] There's going to be a revival in the
[43:40] land. There's going to be a sermon on
[43:41] the revival. No minister ain't going to
[43:43] stop it. No prime minister, no king, no
[43:46] potent, no bishop, no message pop, none
[43:50] guys going to stop what God about to do.
[43:52] He said my word shall
[43:54] return. Give the Lord a shout. Feel a
[43:57] charge in here
[44:03] tonight.
[44:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm
[44:08] doing a great work.
[44:10] and I can't come down. Oh, glory to God.
[44:13] I'm not going down to the carnal realm.
[44:14] I'm not going down to the natural realm.
[44:16] I'm going to stay in the spirit like in
[44:19] the spirit. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[44:21] the house. Shout you on the internet
[44:23] there. Shout who you coming connected
[44:25] live. Hallelujah. Praise God by the
[44:28] clans.
[44:31] Hallelujah. Be seated.
[44:36] [Applause]
[44:43] [Music]
[44:44] [Applause]
[44:46] [Music]
[44:47] [Applause]
[44:49] over 50 years,
[44:51] the power of the word, power of
[44:54] revelation, power of mysteries, laying
[44:57] foundation and mechanics and word and
[44:59] word and word and word, but it's a
[45:01] prophecy. And Baram said if we all
[45:04] acquainted, it's a message of grace. He
[45:06] said that that this during the time of
[45:08] the preparation for the restoration of
[45:09] the temple and Zerubbabel was a great
[45:12] prince among the people who had laid the
[45:14] foundation of the building. Now you want
[45:16] to put on your spiritual thinking. He
[45:19] said watch as we read further we find
[45:21] that God said Zerubbabel has laid the
[45:23] foundation with his hands. He shall also
[45:26] bring forth the headstone. I want you to
[45:28] notice he never said he shall bring
[45:30] forth the cornerstone. He shall bring
[45:33] forth the headstone. And we know that
[45:36] the scriptures say that Jesus is the
[45:38] chief cornerstone and he is also the
[45:41] headstone. Now if we will think for a
[45:43] few minutes that the seven church
[45:46] messenger
[45:47] was to
[45:49] restore the faith of the children
[45:52] back to the fathers. Amen. In other
[45:55] words, rebuild the church again
[45:59] under the power of the spirit. Not by
[46:03] power, not by might, but by my spirit,
[46:07] sayeth the Lord. Not by organization,
[46:10] not by denomination, but by the Holy
[46:12] Ghost. Will God bring forth the church
[46:15] in the last days?
[46:18] So all the preachers that want to hold
[46:20] on and just stay their finger on these
[46:23] divinely re revealed mystery truths is
[46:26] what will literally turn the hands of
[46:28] the church back to the fa faded fathers.
[46:30] They have to tie that with this. Amen.
[46:33] The truths have to become power turn
[46:35] into spirit or we ain't going nowhere.
[46:39] He said it here. The church have to be
[46:41] rebuilt under the power of the spirit.
[46:44] We see the struggle under the word. We
[46:46] see hatred, cut scen of brethren, people
[46:49] ain't shaking hand, no fellowship, and
[46:51] all them pastors figure that they own
[46:52] the people. We see all of that nonsense.
[46:54] But God promised that there were going
[46:56] to be an appointing in the last days
[46:58] that were raised so high that the
[47:01] doctrinal are fellowship. You think God
[47:03] concerned about men who assuing power
[47:05] and taking power behind the pull. God
[47:07] have nothing to do with that. You know
[47:08] every false thing going to come down.
[47:11] Every work going to be tried. Every work
[47:14] will be tested whether is of God or not.
[47:17] Fire cometh to judge every work. You see
[47:19] how Elijah say let the God answer by
[47:21] fire. Let that God be God. The people
[47:24] confused. The people don't know what to
[47:26] do. The people don't know where to turn.
[47:28] Famine in the last days. Not for books
[47:30] and tapes. We have tons of it. But for
[47:32] the hearing of the word of God, for the
[47:34] hearing the anointing of God. Oh, glory
[47:36] to God. You know what the prophet said?
[47:39] When the true anointing of God speaks,
[47:41] it's the voice of God. But over you
[47:43] know, my pastor, that's not what the
[47:45] Bible said. It said when the true
[47:46] anointing of God speaks, it is the voice
[47:48] of God. When God speak, he speaks. I
[47:51] don't care who, by who, or where. It is
[47:55] God's voice. It is God's voice. It's for
[47:57] everybody. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[48:00] the house. Oh, give the Lord a praise.
[48:03] Hallelujah. Once more, the world will
[48:05] hear direct from God. God will speak.
[48:09] I'm not talking about press play on some
[48:11] tape playing around, you know. I'm
[48:13] talking about the living God, the logos
[48:15] manifest. A living word. Living God. Oh,
[48:20] give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. Life
[48:23] thundering out. That's the thunder that
[48:25] going to shake the devil. Oh, give the
[48:27] Lord some praises. Devil is shaking
[48:29] already. He is shaking because there's
[48:32] going to be rebuilding. They're going to
[48:33] be rebuilders. Oh, God had it one time
[48:36] on the day of Pentecost under the church
[48:39] going to be under the same anointing.
[48:41] Believe in the same Holy Ghost that fell
[48:43] under the Pentecost going to fall here
[48:45] tonight. Going to fall among us. going
[48:48] to fall in Trinidad. Going to fall in
[48:50] the meetings coming going to fall around
[48:52] the world. Same Holy Ghost, not another
[48:55] Holy Ghost. Here's why. There's only one
[48:57] Lord. There's only one spirit. There's
[49:00] only one baptism. It had two baptism. It
[49:03] has one baptism. Oh, the Lord a shout in
[49:05] the house. And we are looking for that
[49:07] tonight. Oh, we intend to make a church.
[49:11] They're going to make a revival. We are
[49:12] to make it. We come to mix some some
[49:15] some chemicals tonight. We come to bless
[49:17] and to bless this and to touch this and
[49:19] to hit this. When we mix it together,
[49:21] something going to take place. You can't
[49:23] sit down dead in this thing. Hallelujah.
[49:25] You can't act dead in this thing. Oh,
[49:27] come on now. You're going to find out in
[49:30] here. The spirit was stirred up to go
[49:33] and build. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[49:36] Oh, hallelujah. God put it upon Nhemiah.
[49:39] Ezra had it rough. We're going to read
[49:41] about it. Ezra the building was stopped
[49:44] for 16 years until God serves Zerubbabel
[49:47] and still up here and still of them
[49:50] brothers to go back and finish it and
[49:52] this work will be finished. The work
[49:54] that the Lord started will be finished.
[49:57] The capstone going to come down. This
[50:00] building will be kept. You will be kept.
[50:02] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh, glory to
[50:05] God. You will be kept. This church will
[50:08] be kept. The building will be kept. Your
[50:10] temp is going to be
[50:13] [Music]
[50:16] [Applause]
[50:23] kept. You may be seated.
[50:29] [Music]
[50:35] There's a quote.
[50:38] I don't think I ever read this.
[50:41] I just punched this one up and they say
[50:44] something this as a eagle st is not for
[50:47] of as a eagle st up a nest yakim the 4th
[50:51] of August 1916 but the brand I'm
[50:53] speaking he said let's stand to our feet
[50:56] how many people here hasn't got the holy
[51:00] ghost he's asking that question
[51:04] how many people hasn't got the holy
[51:06] ghost come here just a minute come down
[51:09] out of that balcony me. Amen. This is
[51:11] necessary time. Let's get these loose
[51:15] feathers out. We can't heal or have a
[51:18] real healing service till we get these
[51:20] feathers straight out. God will never
[51:22] take us up there and drop us till we get
[51:25] these feathers out of us. Come now.
[51:28] Everybody, this is Baron speaking to
[51:30] them. Everybody that wants to come under
[51:33] the power of the spirit. Amen. Come up
[51:36] here. Come a minute. stand around this
[51:39] altar. I believe God is going to pour
[51:42] out the Holy Ghost right here tonight
[51:45] and shake this thing and get all the
[51:47] feathers out of here and take his eagles
[51:50] on the wings like that and take us out
[51:53] for a revival.
[51:54] [Applause]
[51:54] [Music]
[51:56] [Applause]
[52:02] They say a change the Holy Ghost just
[52:04] pour out. I know people claiming to be
[52:06] the Holy Ghost. They're liars. But but
[52:08] this Holy Ghost says pour out that is
[52:10] new age doctrine. That is that is
[52:13] Hinduism thing.
[52:16] I am God and and all kind of thing. And
[52:18] who is ocean and not but who is spoon
[52:22] spoon what in the spoon and ocean same
[52:24] thing but a wheel cast in the spoon you
[52:25] know.
[52:27] Wheel is spinning in the ocean. But here
[52:30] once we break past the sound barrier
[52:33] Amen. of hindrances. Yes sir. We have 50
[52:35] miles of elbow room.
[52:37] All we need to break past hindrances.
[52:40] What is your hindrance tonight? What is
[52:42] hindering you?
[52:44] What is holding you back?
[52:48] So Nema response was being watchful. In
[52:53] other words, living a careful life,
[52:56] prayer, vigilance. Amen. And setting
[53:00] gods. Yes, sir. Do you set gods?
[53:03] Or you even study that you have
[53:04] something to God.
[53:07] The Bible talk about guard your tongue.
[53:10] Most people get in trouble for this
[53:11] tongue. Tongue is trouble. You know just
[53:14] to keep quiet is a problem.
[53:18] You know how much marriage could have
[53:19] been saved if the wife had a zip inside
[53:21] the mouth to zip it up.
[53:24] I ain't going to touch you about this
[53:29] tonight against
[53:32] opposition, against
[53:34] enemies, against false brethren.
[53:37] Nehemiah, he used faith, discernment,
[53:40] and perseverance. Amen.
[53:43] Ezra had it hard. The work was stopped
[53:47] by opposition,
[53:49] by legal, by laws. God raised up
[53:52] prophets like Hagi and Zechariah to
[53:54] encourage the people to resume. And I
[53:56] want to read Ezra 4 just quickly. And
[53:59] when the adversaries of Judah and
[54:00] Benjamin heard that the children of the
[54:02] captivity build the temple unto the Lord
[54:04] of Israel, then they came to Zerubbabel
[54:07] to the chief of the father and said unto
[54:08] him, "Let us build with you these
[54:11] rascals,
[54:12] for we seek your God as he do, and we do
[54:16] sacrifice with him since the days of
[54:17] Esaron, king of Asher, which brought us
[54:20] up hither. But Zerubbabel, these peers
[54:22] are designed. Zerubbabel and Joshua and
[54:25] the rest of the chief of the father of
[54:26] Israel said unto them, "Ye have nothing
[54:28] to do with us." Amen. To build a house
[54:30] unto our God, "But we ourselves together
[54:33] will build unto the Lord our God of
[54:34] Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of
[54:36] Persia, had commanded us." Then the
[54:38] people of the land weaken the hands of
[54:40] the people of Judah and trouble them in
[54:43] building. So once you start to build
[54:45] problems, if you're building, everybody
[54:48] love you. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory.
[54:50] We're in the same level. But once you're
[54:52] building, you're going somewhere. Once
[54:55] you're building, you're achieving
[54:56] something. Let's build. Let's start
[54:59] tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If what
[55:03] you build break down, let's rebuild it.
[55:05] Let's let's cover up the breaches that
[55:07] no foxes could come in. That no devils
[55:09] could come in. Let's block them holes.
[55:12] Oh, give the Lord some praises. They
[55:14] hired counselors against them to
[55:17] frustrate their purpose. Now I want you
[55:19] when I'm reading this you understand
[55:20] what is happening in your around your
[55:22] life that when you get a glimpse of
[55:24] something that you have to go after what
[55:26] how things come to frustrate it distract
[55:28] it amen and and and and get you
[55:30] discouraged once you get discouraged you
[55:33] lost your battle you know you lost faith
[55:35] then cuz you're feeling down and out
[55:36] you're feeling discouraged watch this I
[55:38] had counselors against them to frustrate
[55:40] their purpose all the days of Cyus king
[55:42] of Persia even to the reign of Darus
[55:44] king of Persia and in the reign of
[55:45] Hasseras in the beginning of his reign
[55:47] wrote wrote they unto him an accusation
[55:50] against inhabitants of Judah and
[55:52] Jerusalem. And in the days of Ex Azeres
[55:55] wrote Bishlam, Mirat, Tamil, and the
[55:57] rest of their companions. They write all
[55:59] these are the rascals here. These are
[56:01] the writers unto Azeres king of Persia.
[56:04] And the writing of the letter was
[56:06] written in the Syrian tongue
[56:08] and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
[56:11] Rehome the chancellor and shimmy the
[56:13] scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem
[56:15] to Axes the king in this sort then wrote
[56:18] Reham the chancellor and I'll skip that
[56:20] verse 10 and the rest of the nation whom
[56:22] the great noble I'll skip that a lot of
[56:24] big names going around in there that I
[56:26] might get trouble to pronounce and this
[56:28] is the copy of the letter that they sent
[56:29] unto him even unto Azeres the king thy
[56:32] servants the men on this side river at
[56:34] such time be it known unto the king
[56:36] verse 12 that the Jews which came up
[56:38] from thee with from thee to us are come
[56:41] unto Jerusalem building the rebellious
[56:43] and the bad
[56:45] city and have set up the walls thereof
[56:47] and join the
[56:49] foundation. Mark him all what they
[56:51] doing. They see when they join the
[56:53] foundations.
[56:55] Be it known unto the king that if this
[56:56] city beed and the wall set up again,
[56:58] then they will not pay toll, tribute,
[57:02] custom, so shalt thou endamage the
[57:04] revenue of the kings. So then bring it
[57:07] to a tax issue. Then bring it to a
[57:09] government issue where if they only
[57:11] elect them like that, no money coming
[57:13] for you, no revenue
[57:16] here. Now because we have maintenance of
[57:19] the king's palace, it was not meat for
[57:21] us to see the king's dishonor.
[57:24] Therefore, we have sent and certified
[57:25] the king that s may be made in the book
[57:28] of the record of thy fathers. So shall I
[57:29] find in the book of the records and know
[57:31] this city is a rebellious city hurtful
[57:34] to the kings provinces that they have
[57:36] moved sedition within the same old time
[57:38] which caused the city to be destroyed.
[57:40] We certify the king that if they be
[57:43] built again and the walls thereof set up
[57:44] by this means thou shall have no portion
[57:47] on this side of the river. Then send the
[57:49] king and answer to Rahham the chancellor
[57:51] and the king speak. The letter which he
[57:54] sent unto us has been plainly read
[57:55] before me and I commanded and search has
[57:57] been made. It is found that this city of
[57:59] old time had made insurrection against
[58:01] kings, that rebellion and sedition have
[58:03] been made therein, and they have been a
[58:05] mighty kings over Jerusalem, which have
[58:07] ruled over all countries beyond the
[58:08] river, and toll, and tribute and custom
[58:11] was paid unto them. Give you now
[58:13] commandment to give cause these men to
[58:15] cease, that the city be not build it,
[58:17] until another commandment shall be given
[58:19] from me. Take heed now that you fail not
[58:21] to do this. Why should damage grow to
[58:23] the hurt of the kings? And we know the
[58:25] story, the work. Verse 24, then ceased
[58:29] the work of the house of God which is at
[58:31] Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second
[58:33] year of the reign of Darius, king of
[58:35] Persia.
[58:38] It ceased legally by law. By law
[58:47] Hagi 1-14. Then spake Hi, the Lord's
[58:52] messenger in the Lord's message unto the
[58:55] people saying, "I am with you." Say the
[58:58] Lord. That's the encouragement. That's
[59:00] the backing the people get. I am with
[59:03] you tonight. I could hear God saying, "I
[59:06] am with you because you're doing a great
[59:08] work." Give the Lord some praises. And
[59:12] hear the bomb here. And the Lord stirred
[59:14] up the spirit of Jezebel. Zerubbabel.
[59:17] Zerubbabel the son of Shiel, governor of
[59:20] Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
[59:22] of Joedc the high priest and the spirit
[59:24] of all the remnant of the people who did
[59:27] it. God stirred up the spirit and they
[59:31] came and did the work in the house of
[59:33] the Lord of hosts. Their God. Oh, give
[59:35] the Lord some praises. And I am telling
[59:38] you, God have to stir up people for this
[59:40] revival to begin to break out. God have
[59:42] to stir up your spirit. get you out of
[59:43] laziness, slowness, slutfulness,
[59:46] dependency, and and and feeling you're
[59:48] entitled to something. You're entitled
[59:50] to nothing. You're entitled to pray, to
[59:52] fast, to press, to worship, to shout, to
[59:55] dance, to give God glory. Oh, give the
[59:57] Lord a shout. You're entitled to press
[59:59] the battle and to work. Work till Jesus
[1:00:02] come. Work to build that wall. Work to
[1:00:04] build back your family, to build back
[1:00:06] your house, to bring back your prayer
[1:00:07] altar. Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:00:09] house. That's what Elijah had to do.
[1:00:11] Bring back the stones. Oh, give them
[1:00:14] praises.
[1:00:19] Hallelujah.
[1:00:24] So, hindrances can come from outside,
[1:00:27] inside
[1:00:29] there. Spiritual hindrances. Amen.
[1:00:32] Matthew 13:19 says, "When does this be
[1:00:35] side down? When anyone hearth the word
[1:00:37] of the
[1:00:38] kingdom, hear it, and understandeth it
[1:00:42] not, then cometh the wicked one, and
[1:00:46] catch it away that which was sown in his
[1:00:48] heart."
[1:00:50] Say hi, they understand. Devil take it.
[1:00:54] This is he which receives seed by the
[1:00:57] wayside. So you understand how people
[1:00:59] come and say and just leave.
[1:01:01] You understand why it doesn't hold
[1:01:03] inside their heart? You understand why
[1:01:05] they don't want to change? They come in
[1:01:07] but it's wayside. See hitting and
[1:01:10] bouncing
[1:01:11] like that kind of mattress inside. See
[1:01:14] when he bouncing.
[1:01:16] First Peter 58. Be sober.
[1:01:21] Don't be Don't be foolish. Be sober. Be
[1:01:24] vigilant. That mean on your guard you're
[1:01:26] looking. You're just walking blindly. Be
[1:01:30] sober. Be vigilant. Why? Because your
[1:01:33] adversary, the
[1:01:35] devil, is a as a roaring lion walking
[1:01:38] about seeking whom you give before. So I
[1:01:41] want you to see the devil not as a
[1:01:42] passive enemy. You know, as you're
[1:01:46] passing, he's in a
[1:01:48] suit. He not lying suiting.
[1:01:52] He is active in going after you. He's
[1:01:57] active in plotting. I hope you get this
[1:01:59] tonight. He is active in distracting.
[1:02:01] You see, brother Isaac went through step
[1:02:03] after step after step. When the car get
[1:02:05] this way, he go this way. When he can't
[1:02:07] get this way, he go this way. He's not
[1:02:08] stopping.
[1:02:10] Why should he stop? He's looking for an
[1:02:13] entry. He's looking for an enter point.
[1:02:16] And you are saying, "No, devil. I'm
[1:02:17] blocking here tonight. I'm blocking
[1:02:19] here. I'm blocking here." He got to make
[1:02:21] a move. He got to make a different move
[1:02:22] all together. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:02:24] praises.
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:27] Be sober, be vigilant because your
[1:02:30] adversary, the devil is as a roaring
[1:02:33] lion walking about seeking devour. So
[1:02:35] Nim, we know it. He faced mocks,
[1:02:38] threats, sambalot and associates and
[1:02:41] physical attacks. Ezra had legal and
[1:02:44] political opposition, enemies, writing
[1:02:47] work halted. Hindrances can come from
[1:02:50] within with discouragement and fear. Now
[1:02:54] even in Nemiah verse four I think Isaac
[1:02:57] talk about it and Judah said listen this
[1:03:00] is inside chapter this is inside those
[1:03:02] who working the strength of the bearers
[1:03:04] of burden is decayed and there is much
[1:03:07] rubbish so that we are not able to build
[1:03:10] the wall this is the inside now this is
[1:03:13] among the church among the members among
[1:03:15] the people working they say listen it's
[1:03:17] plenty rubbish and thing
[1:03:19] there man getting weak we can't build
[1:03:22] the
[1:03:24] Verse 14. Hallelujah. And I looked and
[1:03:27] rose. This is what do you do when people
[1:03:31] start to talk? You see, it's one thing
[1:03:33] when you're feeling this and that. You
[1:03:34] see, when you start to speak it, it
[1:03:36] could spread like what they say like
[1:03:38] like cold. Common cold. You know, when
[1:03:40] you sneeze, somebody has get sneezed too
[1:03:43] and negativity. Then I looked and rose
[1:03:46] up and said unto the nobles and to the
[1:03:47] rulers and to the rest of the people,
[1:03:48] "Be not
[1:03:49] afraid of them.
[1:03:53] Remember the Lord which is great and
[1:03:56] terrible and fight for your brethren and
[1:04:00] your sons and your daughters and your
[1:04:03] wives and your houses. What did he do
[1:04:07] there? He gave them a word of
[1:04:08] encouragement because they said the
[1:04:10] enemy saying this, the enemy saying
[1:04:11] that. I couldn't read all of that
[1:04:12] tonight. This is from 10. I jumped to
[1:04:14] 14. In between he talk about what the
[1:04:15] enemy is saying and what they're hearing
[1:04:16] and everything else. He said listen
[1:04:18] don't worry about that. You know, don't
[1:04:19] be afraid of them, you know. Our God is
[1:04:21] with us. Hallelujah. Fight. I want to
[1:04:25] give you encouragement. Your hands
[1:04:27] tired, but fight. Look what you're
[1:04:29] fighting for. You're fighting for your
[1:04:31] sons. You're fighting for your
[1:04:32] daughters. You're fighting for your
[1:04:34] wives. You're fighting for your houses.
[1:04:36] Fight.
[1:04:38] Get the courage and fight. Do something
[1:04:40] about it. Don't sit there dead. Fight.
[1:04:43] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:04:49] internal hindrances,
[1:04:51] personal sin,
[1:04:53] fleshly desires, canality,
[1:04:56] doubt and fear. All these are internal
[1:05:00] hindrances.
[1:05:02] Galatians 5:17 says, "For the flesh
[1:05:04] lusted against the spirit, and the
[1:05:06] spirit against the flesh, and these are
[1:05:09] contrary one to another, so that you
[1:05:11] cannot do the things that you would."
[1:05:14] Mark 4:18:19 says, "And these are they
[1:05:16] which are swn among thorns such as hear
[1:05:19] the word
[1:05:21] in church in the message and the cares
[1:05:25] of this world and the deceitfulness of
[1:05:28] riches and the lust of other things
[1:05:31] enter in choke the word and it becomes
[1:05:35] unfruitful." Are we talking about
[1:05:37] brother this and sister that?
[1:05:39] Yes. When it
[1:05:43] come everybody in the message, nobody in
[1:05:45] the bride, you know. I'm the eye and the
[1:05:47] bride. I give it a call or some jig or
[1:05:50] something.
[1:05:54] Hebrews 12:1.
[1:05:56] Wherefore seeing that, and this is the
[1:05:58] big picture, Paul present that we are
[1:06:01] compassed about with so great cloud of
[1:06:03] witnesses, let us lay aside every who is
[1:06:07] he speaking to. Amen. Not people dancing
[1:06:10] in the the parties and and he's talking
[1:06:12] to church members. Let us
[1:06:15] lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:06:20] which so easily beset us. Amen. What
[1:06:23] throw you off? What upset you? What r
[1:06:25] you up? What get you off the beaten
[1:06:27] path?
[1:06:28] And let us run with patience the race
[1:06:31] that is set before us.
[1:06:34] Hallelujah. Are we going good tonight?
[1:06:36] How long with you? This is one of the
[1:06:38] shortest service we're going to have on
[1:06:39] on a Wednesday night. I know you don't
[1:06:41] believe that.
[1:06:47] In
[1:06:48] Hagi, God rebuked the
[1:06:51] people because their priorities was
[1:06:54] misplaced. Yes. They had their own
[1:06:57] personal priorities
[1:07:00] ahead of God's priority and that became
[1:07:04] the hindrance. Yes. Yes. God rebuked
[1:07:07] them. Said, "Is it time for you, oh ye,
[1:07:10] to dwell in your sealed houses?" Yes.
[1:07:14] And this house lie waste. I want to read
[1:07:17] Hei one from verse
[1:07:21] two. Thus speak the Lord of hosts,
[1:07:23] saying, "This people say, the time is
[1:07:28] not come, the time that the Lord house
[1:07:30] should be built."
[1:07:32] The people saying that this people say
[1:07:35] they're ready yet for a seventh Sunday
[1:07:37] revival.
[1:07:39] They're ready for super church super
[1:07:40] race. They want pastor this. Keep
[1:07:43] speaking lovely to them. Not speaking
[1:07:46] the truth in love, you know, speaking
[1:07:47] lovely the truth instead of speaking the
[1:07:50] truth in love. They want this bishop.
[1:07:52] They want that bishop. They don't want
[1:07:53] to get out of their slump and the
[1:07:56] sluggishness to break into revival
[1:07:58] because revival have a price for it, you
[1:07:59] know. Yes, sir. A virus has cost you or
[1:08:01] not. Oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:08:03] house.
[1:08:05] Watch.
[1:08:06] The people say this is God speaking. The
[1:08:09] time has not come that the Lord's house
[1:08:10] should be built. Then came the word of
[1:08:13] the Lord by Hagi the prophet
[1:08:15] saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell
[1:08:19] in your sealed houses or panled houses
[1:08:22] and this house lie waste. Amen. Now
[1:08:25] therefore thus sayeth the Lord consider
[1:08:28] your ways. Ye have sown much and bring
[1:08:31] in little. You eat and you have not
[1:08:34] enough. You drink and you were not fill
[1:08:37] with drink. Ye clothe you but there is
[1:08:39] not warm and you earn wages, earn it
[1:08:41] wages to put it in a bag with holes.
[1:08:46] Thus say the Lord of host, consider your
[1:08:49] ways. Amen. Go up to the mountains and
[1:08:52] bring wood and build a house and I will
[1:08:55] take pleasure in it and I will be
[1:08:58] glorified. Sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] You look for much and know it came for
[1:09:02] little. And when you brought it home, it
[1:09:04] I did blew upon it. Why? Say the Lord of
[1:09:07] because of my house. Amen. That is
[1:09:10] waste. And you run every man into his
[1:09:13] own house. So you seen about your house
[1:09:15] and you I have a burden for the house of
[1:09:18] God. Amen. Shame on you. Oh, give the
[1:09:20] Lord some praises.
[1:09:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Why say the Lord of
[1:09:25] hosts, because of my house that is
[1:09:27] waste, and you run every man in his own
[1:09:30] house. Therefore, the heaven over you is
[1:09:33] stayed from due and the earth is stayed
[1:09:36] from a fruit. And people don't want to
[1:09:38] pay tithes. They don't want to pay
[1:09:39] offering. They don't want to contribute.
[1:09:41] They don't want to support themselves.
[1:09:42] And they figure they fixing itself. Yes.
[1:09:46] And they don't even understand why
[1:09:47] things not working out for them. True.
[1:09:50] Look at right here.
[1:09:52] So Paul said, "We wanted to come to you,
[1:09:55] but
[1:09:56] Satan hindered us."
[1:10:01] Oh, we
[1:10:02] got Look at Joshua and
[1:10:05] Caleb. Joshua and Caleb, we know the
[1:10:08] story. They went out of 10 ministers, 10
[1:10:12] brothers, 10 message people. But when
[1:10:15] they came back, they came back with fear
[1:10:18] and unbelief. Yes. And that is the
[1:10:21] anointing that came among the brethren.
[1:10:23] Amen. When Joshua and Caleb come back,
[1:10:26] their testimonies, we we more than able
[1:10:28] to overcome it. Amen.
[1:10:31] And this is where you have to have a
[1:10:32] different spirit. Like how Caleb had a
[1:10:35] different spirit with them. You have to
[1:10:36] have a different spirit to counteract
[1:10:38] them unbelief that is around. Especially
[1:10:40] that keep saying there is going to be a
[1:10:42] super church. Yes sir. I know she no
[1:10:44] promise no we church. I'm not expecting
[1:10:45] a weak church. If I expect a weak
[1:10:47] church, I may well pack up shop and go
[1:10:48] home. Amen. God promised a super church.
[1:10:52] And God can't lie. If God said what we
[1:10:55] see manifested temporarily will be
[1:10:57] manifested in its fullness. It will be
[1:11:00] manifested in his fullness. God said the
[1:11:03] cap the prayer was never kept. And the
[1:11:05] prophecy it will be kept. We will be
[1:11:07] part of that capstone thing. That
[1:11:10] capstone anointing thing. We are going
[1:11:11] to be part of that. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:11:13] shout. There's a capstone bride. There's
[1:11:15] a headstone bride. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:11:18] shout. Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] Glory to God. So the 10 spies,
[1:11:24] they brought back to the people fear, a
[1:11:27] evil report, they spread discouragement
[1:11:30] to the people. And that the cost of that
[1:11:32] was an entire generation perish in the
[1:11:35] wilderness. Amen. Oh, glory to God. And
[1:11:38] that's why when they say our fathers eat
[1:11:39] man in the wilderness, Jesus said, "And
[1:11:41] there everyone dead." Oh, glory. God has
[1:11:44] judge and believe. We come too far to
[1:11:46] turn back now. We are too close to that
[1:11:48] promised land. Oh, glory to God. We
[1:11:50] can't give up now. I come too far from
[1:11:53] where I started from. Oh, give the Lord
[1:11:55] a shout. We going to preach the gospel.
[1:11:58] The gospel is not just all these texts
[1:12:00] and quotes. The gospel is a
[1:12:02] demonstration of the power of God. The
[1:12:05] sick is going to be healed. The blind is
[1:12:07] going to see. The deaf is going to hear.
[1:12:10] The dumb is going to speak right in
[1:12:13] Trinidad and Tobago. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:12:15] shout. I'm not talking about nowhere
[1:12:16] else right now. Right in this church.
[1:12:19] Let me give it good. Right inside this
[1:12:20] building, you going to see the
[1:12:22] walking. You will see the blind scene.
[1:12:24] I'm prophesying. Right inside this
[1:12:26] building here. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:12:28] in the house. You will see backslided
[1:12:31] restored. They will come from the east.
[1:12:33] They're going to come from the west.
[1:12:34] They're going to come from the north.
[1:12:36] And they're going to come from the
[1:12:37] south. Oh, give the Lord a shout. The
[1:12:40] Holy Ghost is moving again. Hallelujah.
[1:12:43] Revival is on his way again. Oh, give
[1:12:46] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] No demon ain't going to stop it.
[1:12:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:12:56] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] Hallelujah. So, we have to deal with
[1:13:02] discouragement. We have to deal with
[1:13:04] opposition. We have to deal with
[1:13:05] hindrances. Oh, glory to God. Don't let
[1:13:08] nothing hinder you. Keep pressing on.
[1:13:11] Hallelujah.
[1:13:13] Hallelujah.
[1:13:15] Have you read a scripture? This woman
[1:13:18] came to Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus
[1:13:22] told the woman, "It's not fit to take
[1:13:23] the children's bread and cast it to
[1:13:25] dogs." Jesus handled her certain way.
[1:13:28] But Brandon, she had many hindrances.
[1:13:32] This poor little woman, she had many
[1:13:34] hindrances, but her feet didn't have
[1:13:37] any.
[1:13:38] Oh, glory to God. So all the excuses
[1:13:41] people making, they are liars. They have
[1:13:44] unbelief. They have no faith. Because I
[1:13:47] don't care what disappoint you. This
[1:13:49] woman's faith was not disappointed.
[1:13:51] Nothing can rock that faith. She stood
[1:13:53] her grounds. Where are those saints
[1:13:55] stand in their grounds? Friend or no
[1:13:57] friend. Let those virtues work in me. Oh
[1:14:00] Lord is my prayer. Whether I maintain my
[1:14:02] family or not, let me maintain Christ.
[1:14:06] Oh give the Lord a shout. This message
[1:14:08] has to be anchored in your soul. Oh,
[1:14:10] glory. If it's inside of you, take Satan
[1:14:12] and can't take it out. He didn't put it
[1:14:14] in and he can't take it out. What's the
[1:14:16] secret? The word is in the bride. Oh,
[1:14:18] glory to God. The word had to be in you.
[1:14:20] You ain't get the spirit yet, but the
[1:14:22] word in you, they hauled themselves in
[1:14:24] the upper room. They were dry word seeds
[1:14:27] waiting for rain to fall. And when the
[1:14:29] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[1:14:32] were in one mind and one accord. And
[1:14:35] suddenly there came a song. It wasn't a
[1:14:37] music playing. It wasn't some music man
[1:14:39] or some trap set or some drums beating
[1:14:41] or some piano playing. It was a song
[1:14:43] from heaven and they were filled with
[1:14:45] the Holy Ghost. That sound good to me
[1:14:48] tonight. They wasn't saying I am the
[1:14:50] Holy Ghost. They were filled with it.
[1:14:52] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:14:55] and you are going to be filled with it.
[1:14:57] The same Holy Ghost, not another Holy
[1:15:00] Ghost.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah.
[1:15:08] So when you when you studying excuses
[1:15:11] and hindrances of what you think about
[1:15:12] this woman, her faith did not have any.
[1:15:15] She had heard faith had took a hold. She
[1:15:18] heard and her faith took a hold. Now
[1:15:20] they might have said to her, you know
[1:15:21] you are Greek. You know you will never
[1:15:23] get nothing because there was
[1:15:25] segregation. You will get nothing here.
[1:15:28] But she didn't pay attention to that.
[1:15:30] She had faith and that faith was all she
[1:15:33] needed because she know that that was
[1:15:35] the word of God standing there. She had
[1:15:37] faith. Some of them might have said to
[1:15:39] her, "But wait a minute." Her own
[1:15:41] nation, her own church might have said,
[1:15:42] "Now wait a minute. The days of miracle
[1:15:44] is passed. Don't you go down there. The
[1:15:46] days of miracles is passed." But
[1:15:48] something about faith, it has a source
[1:15:51] that don't pay attention to that. It
[1:15:54] doesn't notice it. She might have done
[1:15:56] pick up the word. He was the word her
[1:15:58] faith. Hold on to it. They might have
[1:16:00] laughed at her and said, "But everybody
[1:16:01] else is going to laugh at you. See how
[1:16:03] the mockery has come. So why you going
[1:16:04] there for? Why you shouting for?" And
[1:16:06] this happened in New York. This happened
[1:16:08] at your church. And why you want to go
[1:16:09] there for? And they want to mock and let
[1:16:11] them mock. God give them chance. We have
[1:16:13] a rag jamming time coming, you know, to
[1:16:16] rag jam the the to push the rag inside
[1:16:18] your mouth. They have to be saying stuff
[1:16:21] that go when you jam it in your mouth.
[1:16:23] So they have to shut up. Oh, give the
[1:16:25] Lord a shout because the manifestation
[1:16:27] will be in it. You think I'm playing
[1:16:29] games inside of here? You think I'm
[1:16:31] playing game with these words? I ain't
[1:16:33] playing no games. You know, I mean
[1:16:34] everything I'm preaching inside of here.
[1:16:36] I believe it with all my heart. Rag
[1:16:38] jamming time. He said the critic's mouth
[1:16:40] will be shut. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:16:43] Taking the whole rag and jamming in the
[1:16:45] mouth. Take that devil. Oh, give the
[1:16:47] Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:16:53] God. They might have laughed at her.
[1:16:56] Everybody is going to laugh at you cuz
[1:16:58] your daughter will be just as sick next
[1:16:59] year as she is this year. She will still
[1:17:02] have that devil. She's just as sick. But
[1:17:04] you didn't pay no attention to that.
[1:17:06] Faith had a hole. You'll be put out your
[1:17:09] church if you ever go there. Just
[1:17:10] remember they will put you out. They
[1:17:12] will excommunicate you. That didn't mean
[1:17:14] nothing to her. Faith went over the top
[1:17:16] of all of that. She was determined to
[1:17:18] get to Jesus. And when she got to Jesus,
[1:17:20] she still got a disappointment. Herself,
[1:17:23] but not of faith. Go give the Lord some
[1:17:25] praises. It's not fit to take the
[1:17:27] children's bread and give it to dogs.
[1:17:30] She got a disappointment, but not her
[1:17:31] fate. Hallelujah. She felt bad, but her
[1:17:34] faith didn't feel bad. Her faith was
[1:17:36] rock steady. Her fate was fixed. Oh,
[1:17:39] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:17:42] When she got to Jesus, he said, "I'm not
[1:17:44] sent to your race." What a flat
[1:17:46] rejection. I'm not sent to your people.
[1:17:49] Just think the one that she thought she
[1:17:50] had too much faith in, he turned her
[1:17:52] down. I'm not sent to you people. I'm
[1:17:54] only sent to Israel. You are gentile.
[1:17:56] I'm not sent to you. And besides that,
[1:17:58] you are nothing but a dog. And that
[1:18:00] didn't bother her faith at all. She kept
[1:18:02] moving on. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] He said, if that been one of us, your
[1:18:07] denomination, he said, you'll be talking
[1:18:09] about Emanation. They never hear about
[1:18:11] him again. Praise God. Jesus said, I'm
[1:18:14] not sent to your race. I never come for
[1:18:16] people at all. And you are nothing but
[1:18:17] dogs. Not need to need to take the
[1:18:19] children's bread and cast it as dogs.
[1:18:22] What if that have been a P Methodist or
[1:18:24] a Baptist or a Presbyterian? You will
[1:18:26] see that impostor. She know their laid
[1:18:28] help. She had heard faith up come by
[1:18:30] hearing your word. She know there was
[1:18:32] something real. She wasn't a hot out
[1:18:34] plants. She had to be babyed and betted
[1:18:37] and come to crop today and we have
[1:18:39] something serving after service this
[1:18:40] evening. Next week you're having
[1:18:42] something and you'll come because you
[1:18:43] have something serving. No, no, no. Not
[1:18:44] not that kind of thing. and they get a
[1:18:45] free Bible and and and they drop back
[1:18:48] home and shake your hand and get some
[1:18:50] kind of cake or some kind of not that
[1:18:51] foolishness. He said, "Watch. No, no
[1:18:55] wonder you can't hold that sword of
[1:18:56] faith. No wonder you compromise with the
[1:18:58] word." You see, the word is a sword, but
[1:19:00] the sword can't operate by itself. Is it
[1:19:02] the kind of hand holding the sword? You
[1:19:04] have to have the faith to handle the
[1:19:06] sword to cut out what you want. You
[1:19:09] could ask what you will. You don't
[1:19:10] either walk sty and stingy, stingy.
[1:19:13] You're acting little little little like
[1:19:14] if God have trouble giving things like
[1:19:16] if God have trouble blessing you need to
[1:19:18] act bigger than that. You need to have a
[1:19:20] great expectation
[1:19:24] brother. She was sturdy. She was really
[1:19:28] she had something. She held on. What did
[1:19:29] she do? She admitted he was right.
[1:19:32] That's a real true faith. She admitted
[1:19:34] the truth. I'm unworthy of anything. I'm
[1:19:37] only after the crumbs. And brother Ram
[1:19:39] said, "I'm a crumb hunter myself. Aren't
[1:19:41] you?" Amen.
[1:19:43] This is I just want the crumbs, Lord. I
[1:19:47] can't have a church like they had at
[1:19:48] Pentecost. If I can't, Lord, let me just
[1:19:50] have the crumbs that fall. Peter said,
[1:19:53] "This is that." And I've always said,
[1:19:55] "If this isn't that, I'll keep this till
[1:19:58] that come." Let me say it. Good
[1:20:00] headstone tabernacle. If this tonight is
[1:20:03] not that, we keeping this until that
[1:20:05] comes because this will lead us to that.
[1:20:08] Oh, give the Lord a shout. I can hear
[1:20:09] shouting. Okay, the Lord a shout. Praise
[1:20:11] God. Hallelujah. This will lead us to
[1:20:14] that. Amen.
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] I just keep this till that appears. This
[1:20:23] is the word. And says, watch, I may not
[1:20:26] have faith like Enoch to take an
[1:20:27] afternoon stroll and walk up home with
[1:20:29] God. But I'll tell you one thing. I will
[1:20:31] never stand in anybody way that has that
[1:20:33] much faith. Amen. So why should we let
[1:20:36] anybody stand our way?
[1:20:39] We have faith to go into where we going.
[1:20:40] Amen. We have faith for signs and
[1:20:42] wonders and miracles. We have faith for
[1:20:44] another book of acts. We have faith for
[1:20:45] super church and super race. We have
[1:20:47] faith for the power of God to come in
[1:20:48] our midst. We have faith for the opport.
[1:20:51] We have faith for the supernatural to be
[1:20:53] in our midst. We have faith to call
[1:20:55] Jesus on the scene. Glory to God. We
[1:20:57] have faith to say, "Let the God that
[1:20:58] answer by fire. Let that God be God."
[1:21:01] How much ministers have faith to declare
[1:21:02] that? Oh, glory to God. Instead of hot
[1:21:05] in the head with a set of coat and a
[1:21:06] Bible over the head. Oh, give the Lord
[1:21:08] some praises. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:21:10] God. That why Paul said, "I didn't come
[1:21:12] to you with eloquence and all that. I
[1:21:14] come to you with the power and
[1:21:16] demonstration of the spirit." Why? That
[1:21:18] your faith may not rest on the wisdom of
[1:21:20] man, but in the power of God. Oh, give
[1:21:22] the Lord a shout. When we have all this
[1:21:24] wisdom and all this kind of thing,
[1:21:25] people like how the man say it and how
[1:21:27] they want to express it and how the man
[1:21:28] teach it and what not. But where is the
[1:21:30] power of God to deliver the people?
[1:21:32] Where is the power of God to cast them
[1:21:34] devils out with the long dress in the
[1:21:37] message? Where is the power of God to
[1:21:39] deliver them bullheads from Saturday
[1:21:41] husband? Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:21:43] Look at me statter tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] Give the Lord some praises. So much of
[1:21:48] bullheads in this message. Don't take
[1:21:50] half a service to deal with that. I
[1:21:52] ain't come out to deal with that.
[1:21:53] Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:21:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me get out
[1:22:00] of that street. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:22:03] Praise God. Praise God. Brother
[1:22:05] Brandham, you got to be willing to take
[1:22:07] crumbs. He said, "Do you hear it?"
[1:22:11] Take the crumbs, my brother. Take the
[1:22:15] crumbs, my sister. Regardless of what he
[1:22:17] gives you, just receive it. God, thank
[1:22:20] him. I just got a little bit of faith,
[1:22:22] but I'm sure going to hold on to that.
[1:22:25] Thank you for it. I believe that I can
[1:22:27] be made well. I believe the word of God
[1:22:29] is right. I'm going to hold right onto
[1:22:32] this. I am going to be well. You have to
[1:22:34] say it.
[1:22:39] If I don't preach about revival, there's
[1:22:40] no revival coming. You know, we have to
[1:22:43] preach what we expect. Yes, sir. He just
[1:22:45] interceded on behalf of our confession.
[1:22:48] If we don't confess, we are healed. How
[1:22:49] go we be healed? By your stripes, we
[1:22:51] will heal. You have to confess it and he
[1:22:53] can intercede on that behalf. If I don't
[1:22:56] talk about signs and wonders of miracles
[1:22:58] and Lord confirm your word, where will
[1:22:59] be the confirmation come from? I have to
[1:23:01] say it. God confirm your word with
[1:23:04] signs, wonders, wonders, and miracles.
[1:23:08] It's three different things there. Oh,
[1:23:10] give the Lord a shout. God could give
[1:23:12] you a miracle tonight. When you go back
[1:23:14] home, things change completely in your
[1:23:17] house.
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:25] Listen that centurion who tell Jesus he
[1:23:28] watches long enough. He watch him. He
[1:23:30] hustle. He hustler. He watching. He
[1:23:32] watch him. He watching me. Watching me.
[1:23:33] Watch him. And then he's going to speak.
[1:23:36] He is speaking by revelation. He's
[1:23:38] speaking by inspiration. He said, "Lord,
[1:23:41] I say the one go and he goeth." I say
[1:23:43] the one come and he cometh because I'm
[1:23:45] in a position. I see you in a position
[1:23:49] that you can say go and go. Don't come
[1:23:51] under my roof. Just speak the word and
[1:23:54] my servant back home shall be healed.
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] Jesus.
[1:24:04] Jesus. Jesus couldn't pray. Jesus didn't
[1:24:07] go his way. When that man was on his way
[1:24:10] before he reached the house, what time?
[1:24:12] What time? What time?
[1:24:15] Was he healed? He was convinced. He knew
[1:24:18] God is not dead. He knew God was in that
[1:24:21] man standing there. He knew God is able.
[1:24:24] He know God can't lie. He said, "What
[1:24:26] time was that man healed?" When he
[1:24:28] checked the time, it's the same time
[1:24:30] Jesus spoke. Oh, get the Lord a shout.
[1:24:34] Hallelujah. Jesus told the woman for
[1:24:38] they saying your daughter is delivered
[1:24:40] from that devil. Right there and then.
[1:24:44] Your daughter delivered. Give the Lord
[1:24:47] some praises tonight. You come here
[1:24:49] bong, you're leaving free. You come here
[1:24:51] down, you're leaving up. You come here
[1:24:53] with a battery low, you're leaving your
[1:24:55] charged 100%. Go give the Lord some
[1:24:58] praises. You could give the devil some
[1:25:00] thunder now. The battery was low, but
[1:25:02] now your battery charge. You get a
[1:25:05] recharge. Oh, glory to God. They ask for
[1:25:07] a recharge. Lord, refill us with the
[1:25:09] Holy Ghost. Send a fresh charge.
[1:25:14] Help me tonight.
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:21] Glory.
[1:25:23] Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:25:27] I hearing shouts tonight. You're
[1:25:29] shouting for them who is not here.
[1:25:31] You're shouting for them who is coming.
[1:25:33] You're shouting for them who are sick
[1:25:34] and coming. You're shouting for them
[1:25:36] who's going to be healed. Oh, give the
[1:25:38] Lord a shout. Oh, glory to God. This
[1:25:42] thing eating
[1:25:44] nice as my brother and green will say.
[1:25:47] Hallelujah.
[1:25:49] Glory. You may be seated.
[1:25:53] She had many hindrances. the bar say in
[1:25:56] a different way but faith didn't have
[1:25:57] any entrance. Watch this. said you are
[1:26:00] Greek but you see that was a Jew you are
[1:26:05] Greek and you see they were trying to
[1:26:07] have a race barrier there but faith
[1:26:10] don't know race barrier so all this race
[1:26:12] thing is stupidness and you don't have
[1:26:14] extra devil but you don't like me
[1:26:20] she might have thought this if he is who
[1:26:23] he is believe God and so like that well
[1:26:26] it doesn't matter she was persistent
[1:26:29] so therefore she that perseverance
[1:26:31] because she know what she was going
[1:26:32] after. Do you know what you're going
[1:26:34] after? Then what hinders thou? What is
[1:26:37] hindering you tonight? Amen. Do you
[1:26:39] really know what you're going after? If
[1:26:41] you don't know what you're going after,
[1:26:42] nothing nothing matters. You know, this
[1:26:44] happened that happened. It just happens.
[1:26:46] You know, it's happening around you. You
[1:26:48] don't even know why. You don't know why
[1:26:49] it's happening. Paul knew exactly. He
[1:26:52] said, "I wanted to come." But Satan
[1:26:53] hindered us. Daniel knew exactly when
[1:26:56] Daniel had to pray and the angel Gabriel
[1:26:58] had to come. He was intercepted. Oh,
[1:27:02] glory to God. And Daniel kept on praying
[1:27:04] and brother Brandham said if Daniel
[1:27:05] stopped, the angel had to stop. So your
[1:27:07] prayer bringing angels. Oh, give the
[1:27:10] Lord a shout. Your prayer bringing
[1:27:11] deliverance. Your prayer summoning
[1:27:13] breakthrough. Give the Lord some praises
[1:27:15] tonight. Am I preaching to the house
[1:27:18] tonight? Glory to God.
[1:27:21] That devil was trying to hinder the
[1:27:24] angel Gabriel from coming to Daniel. But
[1:27:27] Daniel was persevering and his prayer of
[1:27:29] faith was pulling that angel until the
[1:27:32] angel bust through. He had to get
[1:27:34] assistance. Oh, his realm of demon power
[1:27:37] we talking about. Okay. The Lord, Sister
[1:27:38] June. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's
[1:27:42] realms of demon power. That's why the
[1:27:44] Bible said we wrestled against flesh and
[1:27:45] blood but against principalities and
[1:27:48] powers and spiritual wickedness in high
[1:27:50] places. We are fighting tonight but we
[1:27:52] bust through tonight. Oh, we had a
[1:27:55] breakthrough here tonight. We can say
[1:27:56] this is a breakthrough service. Can't
[1:27:58] wait to see what Sunday going to hold.
[1:28:00] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. I
[1:28:02] feel like dancing a dancing ahead of
[1:28:04] Sunday. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:28:07] Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] Let me finish here.
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:13] Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:26] Mercian speak to come up. Talking about
[1:28:29] Lazarus. If you only believe, you shall
[1:28:31] see the glory of God. That faith
[1:28:34] overcomes death. Faith is the victory
[1:28:36] overcomes death. Faith is the victory
[1:28:38] over sin. Faith is the victory over
[1:28:40] sickness. Faith is the victory over
[1:28:42] worry. Faith is the victory over
[1:28:43] frustrations. Faith is the victory over
[1:28:45] the world. Faith, not your tears, not
[1:28:49] your emotions, and how you feel when you
[1:28:52] feel God more. That's your God have
[1:28:54] nothing with your feelings. God nothing
[1:28:56] with you and your flesh. You know, God
[1:28:58] have a word that you could challenge him
[1:29:00] on. You could challenge God on his word.
[1:29:02] You can say, "God, you promise. If my
[1:29:05] people that are called by my name shall
[1:29:08] humble themselves and turn from their
[1:29:10] wicked ways, then you're going to hear
[1:29:12] from heaven and you're going to heal our
[1:29:14] land. God, you can't lie. You promise if
[1:29:18] I humble myself. Oh God, you're going to
[1:29:20] raise me up. You promise if I pray in
[1:29:22] secret that you're going to reward me
[1:29:24] openly. Oh, give the Lord a you could
[1:29:27] rest on your promises."
[1:29:31] When the devil tell you head to poverty
[1:29:33] and you're going to be like a vegan in
[1:29:34] the street, tell the devil. David said,
[1:29:36] "I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:29:39] or his seed beg bread. I ain't begging
[1:29:41] no bread." Oh, give the Lord some
[1:29:44] praises.
[1:29:45] That's not my calling. Hallelujah. Watch
[1:29:48] that. So, you get it now? Faith is the
[1:29:51] victory over debt, over sin, over
[1:29:54] sickness, over worry, over frustration.
[1:29:57] Faith is the victory over the world. How
[1:30:00] is it faith right above it? When we have
[1:30:03] the written word of God laying before us
[1:30:05] and the Holy Spirit here performing and
[1:30:06] showing the resurrection of the Lord
[1:30:07] Jesus, what you have to believe it, not
[1:30:09] make believe faith, real faith. Now
[1:30:11] faith is a conqueror. Faith is a
[1:30:13] overcomer. You see that's why the woman
[1:30:15] could stand there and say truth Lord she
[1:30:18] moving you know now. Now they gone you
[1:30:21] know that the last service I come back
[1:30:22] to. People come here already and they
[1:30:24] say the people who invite them tell me
[1:30:26] about them.
[1:30:30] it come back again only to find I know
[1:30:34] nothing about the person but the Holy
[1:30:36] Spirit pick up the spirit speak certain
[1:30:37] things and they want to know if the
[1:30:38] person that invite them tell me about
[1:30:40] them
[1:30:43] watch faith is a conqueror faith is the
[1:30:46] overcomer it's not just a peacemaker it
[1:30:49] overcomes faith is the victory overcome
[1:30:52] the world what does it do what is faith
[1:30:54] faith is a conqueror conquer and victory
[1:30:56] is the same to conquer means to beat
[1:30:58] down, to override, to handcuff, to throw
[1:31:03] into prison. It means that the sin that
[1:31:05] must rule you, you rule it now.
[1:31:09] You don't want to stop sinning, you
[1:31:10] know. No, you want to conquer it. You
[1:31:13] want to arrest it. You want to handcuff
[1:31:15] it. You want to send it in prison. Oh,
[1:31:18] give the Lord some praises. It means
[1:31:19] that the sin that once ruled you, you
[1:31:22] rule it now. It means you have overcome.
[1:31:24] You have whipped it. He said, "I feel
[1:31:26] religious right now." Oh, give the Lord
[1:31:28] a shout. Faith in what? Not faith in
[1:31:32] your church. Not faith in your creed.
[1:31:34] Not faith in some man. But faith in
[1:31:36] Jesus Christ who made the promise.
[1:31:39] That's the victory. What is it? Is the
[1:31:41] victory. Say, "My arm is still crippled,
[1:31:43] but faith is the victory. I still feel
[1:31:45] sick, but faith is a victory. It
[1:31:46] overcomes the world." And when you climb
[1:31:48] into God by prayer, until you seen the
[1:31:51] thing conquered under you, there is
[1:31:53] nothing can hurt you. Then you have
[1:31:55] overcome. You got 50 miles of elbow
[1:31:57] room. You are sailing free. Then you who
[1:32:01] have been drunken and slave to whiskey.
[1:32:03] You'll be a master over him. Then that
[1:32:05] old devil of alcohol that made you
[1:32:07] drink, you you you he's your master. No.
[1:32:10] But when you get faith, I don't mean
[1:32:11] make believe in real faith. He's your
[1:32:13] servant then. You who can't lay down
[1:32:15] tobacco. You woman and woman when it
[1:32:17] comes to a place where you get to a spot
[1:32:18] where you have to overcome, you must
[1:32:20] master it. And then you know the story,
[1:32:23] I'm going to skip it about a little
[1:32:24] woman. She was smoking and she come up
[1:32:26] and get prayer and go back and smoke and
[1:32:28] get back. She cry, she beg. She But what
[1:32:31] I'm said, you see just emotional fight
[1:32:32] in the air. Won't do any good. One night
[1:32:35] down she went to the doctor. Doctor say
[1:32:37] cancer, smoking, cigarette. She's laying
[1:32:38] there to die. Then she get out of
[1:32:40] business. See a drunking man will reach
[1:32:42] for a straw and the woman got delivered
[1:32:45] because she recognized cancer and death
[1:32:47] is the same sentence. The same sentence
[1:32:50] and she didn't want to go back that that
[1:32:52] sentence. She didn't want to be in that.
[1:32:54] Guess what? She get completely
[1:32:55] delivered. Stop smoking cancer. Go on.
[1:32:57] Oh, glory. So God send lose that cancer
[1:33:00] to wake her up. Sometime God sends to
[1:33:02] wake you up. You know because you dull
[1:33:04] dull dull dull dull. But oh God, tonight
[1:33:06] let's all stand. I want God to stir your
