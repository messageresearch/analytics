[54:36] praise God for the pterence of it god
[54:38] bless you and Terence and he who started
[54:41] the work in you is more than able to

[54:46] bring it to pass Oh hallelujah so before
[54:50] you take your seats evidence of your
[54:51] Bible just for this greeting would
[54:53] eternal me to one portion of Scripture
[54:55] but Reuben will be preaching so I'm just
[54:57] here to greet you give my New Year's
[54:59] greetings to the church but I want to
[55:01] read quickly from Daniel 12 from verse 1
[55:05] Daniel 1201
[55:08] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[55:11] the Great Prince which standeth for the
[55:13] churn of thy people and there shall be a
[55:15] time of trouble such as never was since
[55:18] there was a nation even to that same
[55:20] time and at that time thy people shall
[55:23] be delivered every one that shall be
[55:26] found written in the book and many of
[55:28] them that sleep in the dust of the earth
[55:30] shall awake some to everlasting life and
[55:32] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[55:35] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[55:38] brightness of the firmament and they
[55:40] that turn many to righteousness as the
[55:43] stars forever and ever but Thou O Daniel
[55:46] shut up the words and seal the book even
[55:49] to the time of the end many shall run to
[55:53] and fro and knowledge shall be increased
[55:55] with a lord at a blessing to the reading
[55:57] of his word you may be seated this
[56:00] morning so I like to take this time
[56:03] I just wanted to greet you in the
[56:04] precious name of Jesus Christ isn't it
[56:06] good to be back home here in China Nana
[56:09] with the home church as well I bring
[56:11] greetings from Ghana from brother
[56:14] Solomon mechina and the life tabernacle
[56:17] of tamale and the convention over there
[56:19] with an at-sea go where the Ramon
[56:21] Thomason brother Oh Lu where the pollen
[56:24] and Jake are and all the churches and we
[56:26] had a really tremendous time in the
[56:28] convention it was really a mighty mighty
[56:31] mighty meeting and the theme of the
[56:33] convention was taking Jesus out of
[56:35] history now we don't serve a historical
[56:38] God he's a present tense chord and the
[56:40] same thing he did back then and many
[56:43] times where the Branham said it's easy
[56:44] to talk about what Jesus did and it's
[56:46] easy to talk about what he's going to do
[56:47] but it takes a great key to speak about
[56:49] the present tense realities of the
[56:51] Living God especially as we see them
[56:53] falling before our very eyes
[56:55] so but in Solomon had a burden to take
[56:57] Jesus out of history that he's not just
[56:59] the God of yesterday he's not just the
[57:01] God of forever
[57:02] but he's also the God of today and he is
[57:04] still as real today as he was then and
[57:07] he still has you today as you will be in
[57:09] the future and we are looking for a
[57:11] great manifestation in this new year of
[57:13] everything and the Prophet prophesied
[57:15] you believe that this morning so I was
[57:17] certainly want to wish every brother
[57:19] every sister every family every young
[57:21] brother every young sister every young
[57:23] child every member of the church was I
[57:26] connected a happy and blessed and a
[57:28] wonderful new year and that may this
[57:31] year be a year of your spiritual
[57:33] breakthrough may this year be a year of
[57:35] every breakthrough that you have been
[57:36] looking for because there's a promise of
[57:39] restoration there's a promise of all at
[57:41] the cankerworm eats and all the locusts
[57:43] all a palmer worm everything is to be
[57:46] restored and by the rant about the
[57:47] fullness of time and III was invited to
[57:51] preach about Alfred Davidson's a church
[57:53] for all last night I didn't know I was
[57:54] gonna be pitching over last night but I
[57:56] end up reaching over or last night or
[57:58] over there as well
[57:59] and I preached when time runs out
[58:01] because time is running out and I spoke
[58:04] about the blending of time into eternity
[58:07] because everything that's happening
[58:08] around us it's a blending of time into
[58:10] eternity because time is running out and
[58:13] I spoke about how when and I
[58:15] preach the message here before I said
[58:16] when demon left the sheep the countdown
[58:18] of God started and times had to run out
[58:21] on Goliath David they've even know what
[58:23] is going on and Goliath didn't know
[58:25] what's going on but in the economy of
[58:27] God God was counting down time because
[58:29] since the fall of man in the Garden of
[58:31] Eden a clock started in this break from
[58:35] eternity that is a countdown until we
[58:37] reconnect with eternity so everything
[58:40] around us is nothing because we are
[58:42] creatures of eternity trapped in time
[58:44] and we come from God and we are going
[58:47] back to God and that's the great mood
[58:49] that's taking place now we are leaving
[58:51] this place we are getting out of here
[58:53] and we are closer today than yesterday
[58:55] we are closer this year than last year
[58:58] we are closer this month and last month
[59:00] you a closer know that maybe we started
[59:02] this service because every minute that
[59:04] passes it's a countdown going on a
[59:07] countdown to the rapture a countdown to
[59:09] the resurrection a countdown to our
[59:11] complete transformation you may be
[59:13] seated
[59:14] but the turan spoke about a spine
[59:16] straightening out those that do that
[59:18] know that those are easy signs we're
[59:21] gonna see more comfortable said missing
[59:23] links will be restored
[59:25] hallelujah as we near the headstone
[59:27] every service we come nearer to the
[59:29] headstone in this endtime all forces are
[59:33] loose every devil is against this
[59:36] message every demon is against his bride
[59:39] hallelujah
[59:40] but his bride is not anybody's bride
[59:43] it's a bride of Jesus Christ she could
[59:45] never be defeated she could never be
[59:47] crushed she could never back up because
[59:50] she is the bride of Jesus Christ
[59:52] Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of
[59:59] the Lord so in the face of every
[1:00:01] situation because situations will come
[1:00:03] in your life situation will come in the
[1:00:05] world situation will come in the church
[1:00:07] situation will come because God allows
[1:00:10] situations to come God is never
[1:00:12] surprised God doesn't read a newspaper
[1:00:14] and say what is this because everything
[1:00:16] in his mind was written before there was
[1:00:18] a world before there was a moon before
[1:00:20] there was a star we wake up and wonder
[1:00:25] what's going on but God in the economy
[1:00:27] of God he knows the end from the
[1:00:29] beginning
[1:00:30] he is Alpha and Omega is the author and
[1:00:32] the finisher so these are the principles
[1:00:41] of life that as we enter into unknown
[1:00:44] waters because we are walking into
[1:00:46] unknown waters or as I said we have not
[1:00:49] been this way before but we are
[1:00:50] depending on the mighty angel even the
[1:00:53] one with the swept-back wings that guide
[1:00:55] us every day to guide you on your job to
[1:00:58] guide you in your marriage to guide you
[1:01:00] in your prayer life to guide you with
[1:01:01] what scriptures to go to to be able to
[1:01:04] live every day because this message I
[1:01:06] was saying to her over in the office
[1:01:08] this message is not a politically
[1:01:10] correct message the world can feel free
[1:01:14] to claim what they believe and what the
[1:01:17] agenda is and when they identify to be
[1:01:20] well I am free this morning with my
[1:01:22] identification
[1:01:23] I'm identify with the rapture I'm
[1:01:25] identify with a prophet whose purpose
[1:01:28] was to turn the hearts of the children
[1:01:30] black
[1:01:31] Smith of the Apostolic fathers can the
[1:01:36] church say man you can take that out of
[1:01:39] me you can put it out of me you can
[1:01:41] brand it out of me
[1:01:43] you may be seated and every son must be
[1:01:46] tested every son must be tried
[1:01:49] hallelujah because it's an individual up
[1:01:52] here
[1:01:52] I cannot speak for anybody else it's an
[1:01:56] individual up here
[1:01:57] my account is to code we have to report
[1:02:01] to God because he has no grandchildren
[1:02:04] there's only sons and daughters
[1:02:06] hallelujah what have you done with the
[1:02:08] wood what have you done with his gospel
[1:02:10] what have you done with this message and
[1:02:13] in this last hour it's a great hour of
[1:02:15] charge you think the devil is gonna sit
[1:02:18] down and let you walk out of this earth
[1:02:19] know all hell is trying to find you
[1:02:22] because it's a seed in you that's per
[1:02:25] sitting light there's light over you
[1:02:27] from when you were born there was light
[1:02:29] over you when you were walking in the
[1:02:31] world there was light over you because
[1:02:33] there's a seed germ that's inside of
[1:02:36] your soul can the church Haman Oh
[1:02:41] hallelujah may be seated
[1:02:44] so take courage get confidence in this
[1:02:47] that we have believed we have not
[1:02:49] believed cunningly devised fables this
[1:02:52] class was did not start last year 20
[1:02:54] years ago his gospel started when we
[1:02:57] were there before there was a moon
[1:02:59] before there was a stop this story of
[1:03:02] redemption how God wanted to express his
[1:03:05] attributes his love the fact that he is
[1:03:08] the father the fact that is the healer
[1:03:10] the fact that he's a redeemer is that an
[1:03:13] assumption it's a fact it's a truth it's
[1:03:16] the present reality that he will hide us
[1:03:18] under a canopy under his medallion
[1:03:22] in the time of trouble in the midst of
[1:03:24] the storm that's when we speak to the
[1:03:26] storm when there's no food on the table
[1:03:28] then you speak for food you may be
[1:03:31] seated

[1:04:05] to defend himself

[1:05:36] dripping with blood God will still have

[1:06:37] the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:06:39] couple weeks ago and how God plan things
[1:06:42] a certain way to unfold things
[1:06:45] to confuse the devil to confuse the
[1:06:49] devil it sucked and I said God is the
[1:06:51] author of confusion but a gorge but he

[1:24:35] match our title the time is at hand of a
[1:24:39] subject the prophetic vision of the end
[1:24:42] time arrived an inspiration is of
[1:24:45] Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the
[1:24:49] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:24:53] for he is faithful that promised
[1:24:57] hallelujah that's my inspiration let us
[1:24:59] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:25:02] without wavering for he is faithful that
[1:25:05] promised I have to contact Scripture
[1:25:09] you'd have to find it I'm going to read
[1:25:11] it for you is some revelation 10 and
[1:25:14] that is from Lewis 811 just let me
[1:25:16] really quickly and the voice which I
[1:25:18] heard from heaven speak unto me and
[1:25:19] again said go and take the little book
[1:25:22] which is open in hand of the angel which
[1:25:24] stand up on the scene upon the earth and
[1:25:26] I went to the angel and said give me the
[1:25:28] little book no this is not a one-man
[1:25:30] scripture because John represented the
[1:25:32] bride okay so give me a little book and
[1:25:35] he said let me take it and it stopped
[1:25:37] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:25:40] it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:25:41] and I took the little book out of the
[1:25:43] Angels hand is it up and it was in my
[1:25:46] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:25:48] eat let my belly was bitter
[1:25:50] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:25:52] before many peoples and nations and
[1:25:55] tongues and kings or praise the name of
[1:25:58] the Lord so that book brings on that
[1:26:00] prophecy that spirit of prophecy isn't
[1:26:03] that right that will come upon the bride
[1:26:05] and the other context scripture ad from
[1:26:07] revelation 19 is said verse 7 let us be
[1:26:10] glad and rejoice and give honour to him
[1:26:12] for the marriage of the lamb is come on

[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:20] and to her was granted that she should
[1:27:23] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:27:25] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:27:27] of saints and he said to me right oh
[1:27:29] this is beautiful
[1:27:30] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:27:33] the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:27:35] how you complete that how you how you be
[1:27:39] press under that how you frustrated
[1:27:41] under that's bliss and happy then a call
[1:27:44] to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:27:46] God resolution upon you and say you are
[1:27:48] blessed to just get a call this are
[1:27:51] calls for hire job these are calls for
[1:27:54] promotion this is called for bigger pay
[1:27:56] this is the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:27:57] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:28:04] said it on I said unto me these are the
[1:28:07] true scenes of God and I fell at his
[1:28:09] feet to worship Him and he's the enemy
[1:28:11] see the whole do is not I am thy
[1:28:13] fellow-servant and of thy brethren that
[1:28:15] have the testimony of Jesus worship God
[1:28:19] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[1:28:23] of prophecy so when God sent a prophet
[1:28:27] to reveal seven seals open up the
[1:28:30] prophetic vision it was to release that
[1:28:33] spirit of prophecy that would give the
[1:28:36] bride the testimony of Jesus or glory
[1:28:40] divorce or all these years we are
[1:28:42] walking along with the testimony of
[1:28:45] Jesus which is the spirit of prophecy
[1:28:47] after taking the open book according to
[1:28:52] Scripture the prophesied about the
[1:28:54] brides revival the prophesy a will tell
[1:28:57] them seven thunders uttered a voices of
[1:28:59] that pool they're gonna slice and cut
[1:29:01] like the talk that's a manifestation
[1:29:03] what we see should make a church that
[1:29:06] would make a seven dollar revival that
[1:29:09] people will come to see what is being
[1:29:11] manifested not as what being caught not
[1:29:15] what being explained but what is being
[1:29:17] manifested I say the timer's at hand for
[1:29:21] a bright revival when the enemy come out
[1:29:24] of
[1:29:24] flood the Spirit of God raised a
[1:29:27] standard all right you may be seated
[1:29:37] I know what some of you come here for
[1:29:39] but I come in a pre-show with a God I
[1:29:41] have a message to deliver all glory to
[1:29:45] God I not come what you're commenting
[1:29:46] here but I have a word from the Lord or
[1:29:49] chlorine 1/4 the time is at hand and the
[1:29:52] prophetic vision is here that's not the
[1:29:55] proof will come to do to bring a
[1:29:57] prophetic vision to turn our hearts back
[1:29:59] to the face of the father's that will be
[1:30:01] the focus or Chloe we know where we come
[1:30:04] from we know where we going to oh
[1:30:06] hallelujah may be seated
[1:30:09] praise God hallelujah for the testimony
[1:30:13] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and
[1:30:18] the prophecy could only come from the
[1:30:21] book so we cannot prophesy something
[1:30:23] that is not in the book
[1:30:24] it has to be the book because the lamb
[1:30:27] opened the book give it to the Prophet
[1:30:30] the Prophet give it to the bride and
[1:30:32] there were supposed to be a faithful
[1:30:33] ministry seeing what the tests say not
[1:30:39] interpreting what the tape say but
[1:30:44] speaking what the tape say by revelation
[1:30:50] because so many of these technologies
[1:31:40] yes that has been misunderstood because
[1:31:43] is the spirit of prophecy the riser cap
[1:31:47] of Isaac Isaac is the revelation
[1:31:50] halle-loo the transformation of syria
[1:31:52] happening yet prove this and prove that
[1:31:54] we can prove nothing we say God's net so

[1:32:02] nothing we have the testimony of Jesus
[1:32:05] not ever or call it a God without the
[1:32:09] spirit of prophecy we know it's going to

[1:44:59] season with God's Word there was a time
[1:45:02] when the Hebrew children had to make

[1:45:06] bow down to the hidden image and whether
[1:45:07] they gonna keep their feet to chew a
[1:45:09] living God whether they will pray and
[1:45:11] saw them guys mark the behavior of the
[1:45:15] believers in that time and decide to get
[1:45:17] this statue for the to bow down and the
[1:45:19] carrion water and fella slam me to open
[1:45:21] pre-roman normal normal if if there

[1:57:53] hidden stuff or calling about that's my
[1:57:55] quad is hid in this world he has been is
[1:57:57] worth hiding mm you really left open the
[1:58:01] world he said look my hair look me here
[1:58:03] I was intrusive I wasn't Anya I wasn't
[1:58:07] pause I looked here because you know

[1:58:54] heart if you believe Jesus is the Son of
[1:58:57] God
[1:58:58] you can't live the same life you want to
[1:59:00] live you can't if you ever get a trophy
[1:59:04] of Calvary if you just taken a haphazard
[1:59:07] way you fooling yourself but when you
[1:59:10] really get a view of what Jesus was or
[1:59:13] my how I like to preach the deity the
[1:59:15] supreme deity of Jesus Christ if you
[1:59:18] could ever realize who he was and what
[1:59:20] he did for you

[1:59:24] in you you'll be willing to try with a
[1:59:26] trash of the world to live for him how
[1:59:29] marvelous what a person he was if you
[1:59:32] realize on descendant of God Himself
[1:59:35] unfallen himself comment down did he
[1:59:38] could get into your heart the purpose of
[1:59:41] the word is to present a channel that
[1:59:44] worker Dryden
[1:59:48] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[1:59:52] so before the spirit could come there's
[1:59:57] a whom he have believed you were sealed
[1:59:59] but that spirit of promise because the
[2:00:02] word give you a channel to access God
[2:00:05] Adam fell from the word and because of
[2:00:10] that he couldn't stay in perfection God
[2:00:13] had to put him out because that gladly
[2:00:15] either was prepared for perfection
[2:00:17] so Adam fell from the image of God so
[2:00:20] God at the key take him out but what
[2:00:22] purpose to restore but the image which
[2:00:25] is the first man that God made battle
[2:00:28] near so Adam was placed an adult he
[2:00:32] never went to process and he fell
[2:00:37] because he didn't go to the process so

[2:12:56] of your situation let's continue o my
[2:13:00] almighty being humble himself unfolding
[2:13:08] himself and comment about your flesh
[2:13:10] that any man could touch with his hands
[2:13:12] what is he doing claiming his Road
[2:13:14] trying to get into man he went and
[2:13:17] offered his own blood when no other
[2:13:19] blood could do no wonder he was the
[2:13:22] priceless price of heaven no wonder he
[2:13:24] was king of kings he unfolded himself
[2:13:26] and come down and submitted himself on
[2:13:31] the cross and dying when he was stand-in
[2:13:34] there someone said I could call my
[2:13:36] father and he could send me ten legion
[2:13:37] of angels but my kingdom is not of this
[2:13:39] world and hear the crowd say nowhere
[2:13:42] with him i wailing him why didn't he
[2:13:44] tell her and say away with you
[2:13:46] here's the reason he couldn't friends
[2:13:48] look at it
[2:13:49] damn was his own children to think of a
[2:13:53] man's children crying for their daddy's
[2:13:56] blood if my children was running from my
[2:13:59] blood there has been nothing as I could
[2:14:01] see
[2:14:02] take me he if he refused to do it he
[2:14:05] lost his child his very creation his
[2:14:07] human beings and they was the one that
[2:14:10] was calling for his blood
[2:14:11] could you imagine the children calling
[2:14:13] for their father's blood that is the
[2:14:16] reason he couldn't say no if he said no
[2:14:19] they were lost
[2:14:20] I will die freely from my children my
[2:14:24] children and any other father would look
[2:14:26] what he was his own children crying for
[2:14:27] his blood
[2:14:28] oh my and the blood of sheep couldn't do
[2:14:30] it well of course couldn't do it well if
[2:14:32] cattle can do it
[2:14:33] but a blood of God himself and the great
[2:14:36] Hungarian person among Stein I was here
[2:14:38] and fleshed them then he cleansed the
[2:14:40] way that he could come and live in your
[2:14:42] heart know that same spirit that
[2:14:45] thundered from Mount Sinai is living in
[2:14:48] the human being what a marvelous
[2:14:50] supporter said every heart jump a man
[2:14:53] done a sin he committed adultery he
[2:14:56] stole or broke the Sabbath or some
[2:14:58] commandment then he had to get a lamb he
[2:15:01] had to bring this ram into the elders no
[2:15:03] there's a reason why I'm reading it
[2:15:05] right with me this may be a bit a long
[2:15:07] time but I want you to go it and it is a
[2:15:08] reason I'm reading this watch this Saudi
[2:15:11] man sin he commits adultery he stole he
[2:15:14] broke a Sabbath then he had to get a
[2:15:15] lamp this is poor system he had to bring
[2:15:18] the llama to the elders they had to look
[2:15:20] this lamb over the lama to be blameless
[2:15:22] had to be without a flaw on it look at
[2:15:25] the significance here the lamb had to be
[2:15:28] blameless for a blamed person
[2:15:35] I remember a little story I don't know
[2:15:42] what I ever told them not just a little
[2:15:43] fiction story under the law if I all
[2:15:46] mother horse had a Colt and it was a
[2:15:47] mule you know and his ears broke down
[2:15:49] his knees knocked what a cross a
[2:15:51] horrible can knew that knew he could
[2:15:53] look at himself is oh no my when he must
[2:15:56] have come he will kill me because he
[2:15:58] couldn't feed me I'm not going to live
[2:16:00] look at me what I'll be looking miss I
[2:16:01] am but if the mother could speak back to
[2:16:04] that little fellow she was in wait a
[2:16:05] minute honey you can live because you
[2:16:07] are my first and you have a but right
[2:16:10] now when the master come out and seized
[2:16:12] you with all your condition he has got
[2:16:13] to go back and get a lamb without
[2:16:15] blemish on it and kill it so that
[2:16:18] crippled up looking moon could live you
[2:16:20] see the priest never seen the mule he
[2:16:22] saw the limb it wasn't whether the mule
[2:16:25] was perfect it had to be a perfect lamb
[2:16:28] I hope you see it it isn't whether you
[2:16:31] are good enough to be a Christian or not
[2:16:34] it is whether he was good enough and if
[2:16:37] God accepted him and his blood makes an
[2:16:39] atonement God don't see you
[2:16:41] he sees the lamb that's a little mule
[2:16:45] could stick up his tail in the air and
[2:16:47] snort and jump and run over the field
[2:16:50] and have a good time he is going to live
[2:16:55] but one perfect had to die that was me
[2:16:59] William bear him no good not fit to live
[2:17:02] would you go to hell born in a sinful
[2:17:05] family raised a sinan over at all but
[2:17:08] one day I accepted and when God looked
[2:17:12] on Christ Christ took my place then God
[2:17:15] don't see me he sees the perfect one
[2:17:18] then as long as I am here in him
[2:17:21] I am perfected not in myself in him this
[2:17:27] is the part of what I got - not my
[2:17:29] perfection I don't have any but it is
[2:17:32] this perfection or give the Lord a shout
[2:17:36] or glory that God is not your perfection
[2:17:39] it's his perfection Oh glory to God
[2:17:43] hallelujah glory to God let's bet his
[2:17:48] cap it off here so Paul said when the
[2:17:50] worshiper come and bring if you don't
[2:17:52] wrong he come with a little lamb the
[2:17:54] priests check the lamb and so on and
[2:17:56] here comes the man that was done wrong I
[2:17:57] have been stealing and I know no I'm
[2:18:00] subject to death because I did wrong God
[2:18:03] wouldn't want me to steal his
[2:18:05] commandment see not know I'm going to
[2:18:07] leave my hands upon the lamb and gore
[2:18:09] commandment said he had thou shalt not
[2:18:10] steal I stole I know am sorry that
[2:18:13] something got the answer for my sin
[2:18:15] cause I stole
[2:18:16] and God said add a video of that day you
[2:18:18] die you steal you got a die fit so he
[2:18:21] required if I didn't want to die I had
[2:18:23] to bring a lamb so I leave the land on
[2:18:25] here I put my hands a little fellow I
[2:18:26] said Lord I'm sorry as I stole I confess
[2:18:29] and promise you I won't steal anymore
[2:18:31] except me no I'm gonna accept him
[2:18:33] because the lamb took that place oh
[2:18:36] isn't that right hallelujah
[2:18:39] so you see now we see that we do wrong
[2:18:42] and I have did wrong I have sinned I
[2:18:44] believe wrong I've done wrong
[2:18:45] now I come to the altar by feet I'll see
[2:18:48] the sacrifice and lay my hands upon
[2:18:50] Jesus head I said dear God I know I'm a
[2:18:53] sin and the reason is dead
[2:18:54] I could talking and so on Oh or glowing
[2:18:58] or God the first man went under the law
[2:19:00] under animals but couldn't change his
[2:19:02] heart because I animal life wouldn't
[2:19:04] compare with a human life and in my life
[2:19:06] as a living being but not a soul but God
[2:19:08] put a soul of man and what is the soul
[2:19:11] the nature of the Spirit so the soul of
[2:19:14] Jesus coming inside of you released the
[2:19:17] Holy Ghost and your nature change and
[2:19:19] you attain out and you are being born
[2:19:22] again by the Spirit is not something
[2:19:24] else
[2:19:24] hallelujah I already made one sacrifice
[2:19:27] for himself
[2:19:28] every sin every desire everything was
[2:19:30] taken from the man's heart and he stands
[2:19:32] perfected in the sight of God not by
[2:19:35] what he has done but what jesus done for
[2:19:37] him
[2:19:39] this song is so simple right but many
[2:19:42] people still go out SEP this they still
[2:19:44] wallowing in the condemnation and you
[2:19:46] have to accept this or chlorine or
[2:19:48] Corrie except the blood speaking on your
[2:19:50] behalf and when God looked on he doesn't
[2:19:52] see you
[2:19:52] he sees your voice come and chew the
[2:19:54] blood that brother Sui can I die for
[2:19:56] them I took their place see there's a
[2:20:01] big guilty guilty a year by clear the

[2:35:19] the place
[2:35:20] where hope is restored where faith is

[2:35:28] what his stone tablet is about or glory
[2:35:31] hope for the hopeless revival for them
[2:35:34] lo fate hallelujah and a transforming
[2:35:38] power by seven little noises my god
[2:35:44] hallelujah glory to God praise the name
[2:35:49] of the Lord so the lamp take the book on
[2:35:52] seal division we sent it to John
[2:35:55] Whitehorse red horse black horse pale
[2:35:57] horse soars on the altar and the seven
[2:36:00] seals silence because under they have a
[2:36:03] bride and the prophecy them Tumblr's
[2:36:05] under the silence he put the tunnels
[2:36:07] under the silence and the tunnels was
[2:36:09] gone to get the bride not 14-ton does
[2:36:11] just seven seven thunders loosen seven
[2:36:14] spirits though all of the earth
[2:36:17] hallelujah God took the prophet but the
[2:36:20] spirits remain Alou and that spirit come
[2:36:24] to produce the testimony of Jesus by the
[2:36:27] spirit of prophecy or glory no got the
[2:36:31] prophesy of this bride that will not
[2:36:34] come to perfection before the
[2:36:36] resurrection I want to see it again you
[2:36:38] have to come to perfection before the
[2:36:41] resurrection and that's why I read is
[2:36:43] not your perfection it is his perfection
[2:36:46] Oh
[2:36:47] underneath the blur hallelujah glory to
[2:36:52] God hallelujah
[2:36:55] so this prophetic vision of the end time
[2:36:59] that was loosed by that malachi for
[2:37:02] prophet came in two parts one was the
[2:37:06] learning of his word as he said in the
[2:37:11] time of the revelation of these things
[2:37:13] being made known so we have been living
[2:37:17] under the time of the revelation of
[2:37:21] these things being made known but at
[2:37:24] some point
[2:37:26] it has to change to the manifestation of
[2:37:29] these things that was made known Oh
[2:37:33] glory to God I say the time is at hand
[2:37:36] or glow in the core the change of the
[2:37:39] mechanics the dynamics the change from
[2:37:41] the revelation of these things we may
[2:37:43] known all the mysteries been revealed
[2:37:45] these mystery truths been revealed into
[2:37:49] the manifestation because you cannot see
[2:37:52] seven thunders just design review
[2:37:54] institutes because seven thunders is to
[2:37:56] become a manifestation seven thunders is
[2:37:59] in two parts revelation and
[2:38:00] manifestation I say the time is at hand
[2:38:03] for the manifestation of the seven
[2:38:06] thunders or glory to God where sons will
[2:38:09] be placed in their ranks
[2:38:10] o God put the patch upon the sons make
[2:38:14] this one a general make this one a
[2:38:16] lieutenant make this one this slowly and
[2:38:18] that's all yeah and put the stamp of a
[2:38:20] pool I'll lose the money earth steve was
[2:38:23] a deacon busting the word ripping food
[2:38:25] Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout all
[2:38:30] of them filled with the Holy Ghost all
[2:38:32] of them were the open vision
[2:38:34] I wonder holy Sh I have this vision the
[2:38:37] whole church have a prophetic vision
[2:38:38] what the prophet reveal that you have to
[2:38:41] become you have to become a living would
[2:38:43] practice continue Oh hallelujah
[2:38:47] what about their seven seals seven
[2:38:49] spirits seven angels seven horns seven
[2:38:52] churches seven sevens
[2:38:56] he says external mists of the lamb have
[2:39:00] been slain having seven heads seven eyes
[2:39:01] which are the seven spirits of God
[2:39:04] similarly only what is those seven
[2:39:07] spirits them seven messengers
[2:39:13] he interpreted that he converts every
[2:39:16] spirit in the Sun messages he said every
[2:39:19] scene Columba Arrhenius John Wesley
[2:39:21] Martin and so forth the seven spirits
[2:39:23] which are seven men which asked seven
[2:39:26] messages so he accomplished the men you
[2:39:32] have to preach the messages these seven
[2:39:37] men go coming to you so when you convert
[2:39:43] that the seven spirits or glory the
[2:39:49] zodiac must commend to you this book is
[2:39:52] not coming to you but this pyramid is
[2:39:57] all glory hallelujah hallelujah show
[2:40:07] trone's
[2:40:09] lightnings seven lamps or seven stars
[2:40:12] call seven spirits meaning
[2:40:15] manifestations of the Holy Spirit of the
[2:40:18] seven Church ages at the seven seats of
[2:40:20] most of the people here they are seven
[2:40:22] seas of mercy seven seats seven churches
[2:40:25] seven stars several manifestation seven
[2:40:28] spirits seven lamps all mine how God is
[2:40:31] perfect
[2:40:31] Oh glory to God so what the Prophet did
[2:40:36] the Prophet come and bring us a big
[2:40:37] panoramic of this vision of the end time
[2:40:40] sharing the truth is supposed to be the
[2:40:43] sixth season unfolded judgment the white
[2:40:45] horse right now riding straight to hell
[2:40:46] or glory to God but he saw a vision of
[2:40:49] the pride being called out he saw a
[2:40:51] vision of a break come back and step he
[2:40:53] saw a vision of a bride just like the
[2:40:55] first one or walking on what Christians
[2:40:58] own as national tour he saw that right
[2:41:01] and the one hold out the step before he
[2:41:03] said get back and step what step this
[2:41:06] step of the world there's only seven
[2:41:08] steps ago get back and step faith virtue
[2:41:11] knowledge although he stepped of a
[2:41:13] flagship in the twenty seven steps alone
[2:41:15] it's not twenty seven mysteries is only
[2:41:18] seven mysteries there's seven voices
[2:41:20] seven thunders seven voices seven steps
[2:41:25] glory to God are you with me hallelujah
[2:41:27] praise be to Jesus hallelujah so what
[2:41:31] all his messages to produce is supposed
[2:41:33] to bring back listen carefully the
[2:41:35] Ministry of Jesus Christ not my ministry
[2:41:44] - no it's supposed to restore the
[2:41:49] Ministry of Jesus Christ back among the
[2:41:52] people then he said at the finishing of
[2:41:55] the seventh seal we're supposed to be
[2:41:57] all the way up there and then we are
[2:41:59] worshiping the Living Christ him moving
[2:42:02] in and out among us who is that Christ
[2:42:04] Oh hallelujah priest we believe that
[2:42:08] thank you lord thank you lord
[2:42:10] hallelujah give him some praises glory
[2:42:14] to God hallelujah hallelujah uncle oh
[2:42:19] Jesus
[2:42:20] glory God alone holds the key who do men
[2:42:26] say I the Son of Man am though I the
[2:42:28] Christ
[2:42:28] so Court holds the key to Revelation God
[2:42:31] alone knows that though there is no
[2:42:34] school no theologians no teaching of the
[2:42:38] Bible among any school that knows
[2:42:40] anything about it they cannot know
[2:42:43] nothing about it is impossible for them
[2:42:46] to know about it about it God has hid
[2:42:48] the senses of knowing it from the very
[2:42:52] elected teachers it's a personal
[2:42:57] individual of fear with the person that
[2:43:01] Christ is revealed to them so when
[2:43:06] somebody want to manage you and bring
[2:43:08] you onto the umbrella like if you go
[2:43:10] lose your salvation if you go lose your
[2:43:13] life you will not die at church or
[2:43:14] whatever it is
[2:43:15] all of that is foolishness because this
[2:43:17] is not you and Mary and God this is not
[2:43:21] you deep past and very you and God we
[2:43:23] pass this data fulfill our role and a
[2:43:25] purpose but you are his sons and
[2:43:27] daughters and the faithful ministry is
[2:43:29] placed for your perfection to bring you
[2:43:32] into the channel that is spirit could
[2:43:34] flow freely
[2:43:35] or glory to God because the spirit have
[2:43:38] to come into the body and flow out pizza
[2:43:42] was in the body and it flowed out to the
[2:43:44] ether when you knock it flowed out at
[2:43:46] Cornelius house right Peter yet spake
[2:43:47] these words God shucked him he didn't
[2:43:50] expect that when he began to speak the
[2:43:53] word the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius
[2:43:54] and open up the door for the Gentiles
[2:43:56] they serve a truth look the Holy Ghost
[2:43:58] that fell on us well on them so broad
[2:44:01] mixing up this thing God has to permit
[2:44:03] us to choose alone and grow an Italian
[2:44:05] tower no it's going the opposite board
[2:44:09] about the finish the sentence that is
[2:44:11] where we have to get desperate because
[2:44:14] there was so much only force in the
[2:44:15] bucket
[2:44:16] to access equality equal in last drop
[2:44:21] any bucket when that access I said you
[2:44:23] know book is closed brightest ceiling
[2:44:26] foolish virgins foolish virgin
[2:44:29] oh my particular more hallelujah it's a
[2:44:33] personal individual of fear with the
[2:44:35] person that Christ revealed to them and
[2:44:37] if you say there we go he revealed to me
[2:44:41] and the life that Christ producer in the
[2:44:45] Bible that same life is in him does not
[2:44:48] produce itself you have got the wrong
[2:44:49] revelation I am man talk all connoting
[2:44:53] but the angel and his ministry and this
[2:44:57] and that and so on overseas I I
[2:44:59] everybody claim in some kind of thing
[2:45:01] but the light is something completely
[2:45:05] different and that's what seeing if the
[2:45:07] angel come and say something and the
[2:45:10] life is Nydia we want where that angel
[2:45:11] change the angel dismiss that angel say
[2:45:16] I don't want you because it has to
[2:45:18] produce a life
[2:45:20] I don't want to enjoy it merely because
[2:45:22] I give and I'm a slacker and there's no
[2:45:24] life with it and I claim in some
[2:45:25] manifestation I don't want no
[2:45:27] manifestation like that I want that I
[2:45:30] don't need to see a sign you know I just
[2:45:33] want this I want this thing living in me
[2:45:36] I want to know my wife could see it feel
[2:45:38] it
[2:45:39] I want him a churn that see it let me
[2:45:43] drop this bomb on you
[2:45:44] he said the ministry has reached
[2:45:47] perfection when Christ is representing
[2:45:56] that is not talking Christ that is not
[2:45:59] preaching a message that is repetition
[2:46:05] the same life that Jesus had who's the
[2:46:10] not your flesh nor Putin if people bunks
[2:46:18] you to get it just sticky but honey this
[2:46:24] sticky but love oh bloody bees could
[2:46:27] understand that the bees body language

[2:51:30] come upon your life you'll be robbed
[2:51:34] but the canopy of life you'll be taken
[2:51:37] into the tent of his loves its banner
[2:51:43] over me it's love they will write a book
[2:51:52] of us beyond your misses it cause it's
[2:51:54] the same life see what I mean you just
[2:51:56] can't get away from it it's the life of
[2:51:59] Christ in you being injected in you by
[2:52:03] the Holy Spirit it's self living its
[2:52:04] life through you he said God here we go
[2:52:07] is known by simplicity and a revelation
[2:52:12] of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate
[2:52:21] so the person who can read and write in
[2:52:24] him or anybody they could get a
[2:52:27] revelation of Jesus Christ and God can
[2:52:31] make himself known to that person the
[2:52:34] most illiterate
[2:52:36] listen therefore you don't need
[2:52:39] education to get revelation you don't
[2:52:46] have to be educated to get revelation
[2:52:50] here we go see not your theology it's a
[2:52:54] revelation of Jesus Christ upon this
[2:52:56] rock I'll build my church no other rocks
[2:52:58] accepted no nothing's accepted nor the
[2:53:00] Roman rock nor the protest nor the
[2:53:01] school knew nothing but on exactly the
[2:53:03] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[2:53:05] new bird he borns in there and he
[2:53:07] injects his own life and your life is
[2:53:08] gone
[2:53:09] and the life of Christ has projected so
[2:53:11] true you whipped preeminence --is that
[2:53:14] means yourself is disappearing the life
[2:53:19] of christ project and true you say we'll
[2:53:21] be okay I know me right I hunt you I
[2:53:23] know me I know my nature and son like
[2:53:25] that
[2:53:25] but when Christ begins to take over I
[2:53:27] would see less of me and more of him
[2:53:32] because you will know you and when you
[2:53:34] begin to behave and a behavior that is
[2:53:36] unlike you you know is him come on come
[2:53:43] on come on now come on now you are you
[2:53:48] but when his lies begin to be projected
[2:53:51] through you you'll find yourself
[2:53:53] operating on a level not the humanistic
[2:53:56] realm but the realm of Revelation
[2:53:59] brilliant of vision so that's the three
[2:54:01] steps is that any humanistic okay look
[2:54:05] you wanna say Graham is they get very
[2:54:06] posture in fact we see we see that all
[2:54:09] extremist for me
[2:54:15] you feel it look like a bird tell me
[2:54:17] chouhi I do ever do that say when I
[2:54:21] should I like I'd let them s and some
[2:54:24] pastors have got rank on the anybody
[2:54:27] shootin no they wanna get one person a
[2:54:30] no I didn't do that
[2:54:33] I'm meeting by yourself and shoot your
[2:54:34] poo one shot don't shoot
[2:54:41] you will know who I'm talking to I don't
[2:54:44] need to take pulpit time to blast one
[2:54:47] person with an issue no I will tell you
[2:54:50] and you will know if you want talking to
[2:54:54] you can have time as you pass the
[2:54:56] session on blast and I worked and I
[2:54:58] personally trying to get to look around
[2:55:02] one time a sister own semen
[2:55:04] even before he the statement even
[2:55:06] finishes in email amen amen amen
[2:55:08] I think it passed a blast in the image
[2:55:09] most evil emitted a - she said no she is
[2:55:16] totally
[2:55:25] he said what's God's revelation
[2:55:28] unfolding by lack of this revelation is
[2:55:31] why we are so much divisions among us so
[2:55:34] much mockery so much division is because
[2:55:36] the people lack that revelation they
[2:55:40] lack that revelation the teachers he is
[2:55:43] saying teachers lack the revelation of
[2:55:46] Jesus Christ
[2:55:48] now whatever early teaching is intellect
[2:55:51] all right I think I'll tell you wrap up
[2:55:54] here listen to more always I feel inside
[2:55:57] like a rock finish or like rocks I feel
[2:56:01] like I know started here right now
[2:56:02] there's not even second witness telling
[2:56:04] me first real focus six hours even I
[2:56:08] would do a community service because
[2:56:09] treated shape exactly laughing anyone
[2:56:12] service today grace take some more I
[2:56:18] want to see let me see where I'm at see
[2:56:21] what peach I'm out here I have 32 pages
[2:56:27] I'm a singer Norrish peach 15 yes
[2:56:29] I've told two pigeons on OHP 15 soap
[2:56:32] opera in Annie train right now all right
[2:56:34] so this is pick up a pen and write the
[2:56:37] Lord spoke to him I was seeking the Lord
[2:56:39] and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[2:56:41] my pen and write I crushed the pen to
[2:56:43] write his Spirit gives me a message for
[2:56:46] the church and I want to bring it to you
[2:56:47] it has to do with the world and the
[2:56:49] bride now I notice these things we heard
[2:56:51] before but I want to hear it again I
[2:56:53] feel as a special season on time and I
[2:56:55] feel as applicable to the time and sees
[2:56:57] me in that is why I'm bringing it to you
[2:56:59] this is what the Prophet this is what
[2:57:01] God spoke here is what I'm trying to say
[2:57:04] to you the law of reproduction is that
[2:57:06] each species would bring forth after its
[2:57:08] own kind even according to Genesis 111
[2:57:10] and God said that it had been for grass
[2:57:13] the hope even see the fruit trees and
[2:57:14] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[2:57:16] itself upon the earth it was so whatever
[2:57:18] life was in the seed came Fortin to our
[2:57:20] plant
[2:57:20] Denson to the fruit sighs the process
[2:57:22] the very law applies to the church today
[2:57:25] whatever seat staff to the church will
[2:57:27] comfort and be like the original seed
[2:57:29] because it is the same seed in these
[2:57:31] last days here we go the true bride
[2:57:33] church christ seed
[2:57:35] we'll come to the headstone number one
[2:57:39] hallelujah
[2:57:40] we'll come to it the headstone the bride
[2:57:43] church will come to the headstone Danny
[2:57:45] said in system does the does the tund
[2:57:51] escape the pyramid so that Thomas is the
[2:57:55] headstone
[2:57:55] yes the tundish is the capstone
[2:57:59] revelation of Jesus Christ in two parts
[2:58:02] mechanics and dynamics so people fight
[2:58:05] up with mechanics these years not even
[2:58:08] understanding them mechanics was only
[2:58:10] making with dynamics because he said my
[2:58:13] word is spirit and life it's not just a
[2:58:15] meaning of the word it's power being
[2:58:17] manifested so your promise is not just a
[2:58:20] word promise your promise has to be a
[2:58:22] living promise I manifested promise when
[2:58:25] quad get around the world of Isaac he
[2:58:26] added word for 35 years but an Isaac had
[2:58:29] to come
[2:58:29] Duff indicate the word that boardgame 25
[2:58:33] years ago God not lying to us if God
[2:58:36] said in elastico be a super church they
[2:58:38] know light super is another life as we
[2:58:42] near the headstone that mean every
[2:58:47] message should be pushing us towards the
[2:58:49] head start
[2:58:50] [Applause]
[2:58:53] [Music]
[2:58:54] which is the love because the love is
[2:58:57] the strength of the entire body so as a
[2:59:00] claim of higher getting more and more
[2:59:02] stronger and stronger it doesn't destroy
[2:59:04] all let's continue what the true bride
[2:59:07] church christ seed will come to the
[2:59:09] headstone and she will be
[2:59:13] this is prophecy she did not choose
[2:59:17] members there's not natural church this
[2:59:20] is the right she will be the super
[2:59:24] church a super race as she nears him the
[2:59:29] in the brain will be so much like him
[2:59:32] that they will be in his very image
[2:59:34] number one very image before power image
[2:59:41] i'm not hearing you before adam at power
[2:59:45] what it was said let us make man in our
[2:59:48] image and likeness then let them have
[2:59:50] dominion so to come back to power you
[2:59:53] have to come back to image to come back
[2:59:54] to power you have to come out to the
[2:59:56] pyramid to come back to power get some
[2:59:58] melted and virtues hallelujah

[3:00:08] so he is prophesied that you will have
[3:00:11] the token he is prophesied you will have
[3:00:13] all them seven virtues he is prophesied
[3:00:15] you will have the life of Jesus Christ
[3:00:16] he is prophesied he will come to
[3:00:18] perfection or to the Lord so you can sit
[3:00:20] here under that prophecy without giving
[3:00:26] for some worship
[3:00:26] [Applause]
[3:00:35] what is image why
[3:00:38] let the spirit that tentacle openers
[3:00:40] right explain why the bright have to be
[3:00:43] is very image the next statement
[3:00:44] identifies why this is an order to be
[3:00:49] united with him there will be one that
[3:00:57] is why the Holy Ghost can never come out
[3:00:59] alive they were praising and blessing
[3:01:02] God continually so they had an
[3:01:04] atmosphere to prepare themselves for the
[3:01:07] atmosphere so if there is no worship
[3:01:11] nothing is coming and the revival coming
[3:01:14] that church is a tribulation Church

[3:08:23] true seed so from the true seed have a
[3:08:26] little group coming out call represent
[3:08:28] Christ for the beloved bride she's a
[3:08:30] vision of his word she is a vision
[3:08:32] because she knows no man-made creature
[3:08:33] dogmas by and to the members of the
[3:08:36] bride will be fulfill all that was
[3:08:40] promised to be made manifest by the
[3:08:42] vision the word promise came to the
[3:08:45] Virgin Mary but the world of promise was
[3:08:48] he himself think about that now the word
[3:08:51] was he he's not saying the world is
[3:08:58] doctrine the word of promise was he
[3:09:02] himself to be made manifest so it's more
[3:09:09] than just word were changing the heap
[3:09:14] so the mystery come not as the word and
[3:09:17] the word change to him ah
[3:09:20] who is him as many as received him to
[3:09:27] them gave he power he and the world is
[3:09:30] the same in the beginning was the word
[3:09:32] will become him by the word becoming
[3:09:35] flesh that's him
[3:09:36] but for him that coming to you do is
[3:09:38] come by the word the word coming to you
[3:09:41] that's the secret and then the world
[3:09:44] turned to spirit power in you it come
[3:09:49] like right under the devil's nose God
[3:09:52] slip the word inside of you in silence
[3:09:58] and the devil is messed up because he
[3:10:03] cannot see the treasure hidden in
[3:10:05] earthen vessels or could we give the
[3:10:07] Lord a shout
[3:10:08] [Applause]
[3:10:13] whoever sees it so a safar system come
[3:10:16] back again is if Dobby go he knows sure
[3:10:17] you don't know who you are
[3:10:18] so he don't know who we are he think we
[3:10:21] play with words and play with game and
[3:10:22] I'm thing like that a bunch of people on
[3:10:24] the internet and they Brown this and
[3:10:25] random that and I said us foolish and
[3:10:27] somewhat not fighting the profit half of
[3:10:29] them was even more wrong there wasn't
[3:10:30] born there they know nothing about no
[3:10:31] experience they only seen what other
[3:10:33] people say and they fight and they have
[3:10:37] to do it there are non seeds so they
[3:10:43] can't be Quicken
[3:10:44] this message is not for them this
[3:10:47] message is for his brain let me let me
[3:10:50] come to you quickly what the word of
[3:10:52] promise was he himself to manifest God
[3:10:55] was made manifest
[3:10:56] he himself acted at that time and
[3:10:58] fulfill his own word of promise to the
[3:11:00] version it was an angel that brought her
[3:11:02] the message
[3:11:02] but the ancient message was the Word of
[3:11:04] God and He fulfilled it at a time the
[3:11:06] members of the bride will love him they
[3:11:10] will have his potentials for he is their
[3:11:13] head not some man in England not some
[3:11:16] analyst it's not some man in Africa or
[3:11:19] South America actually I don't know
[3:11:20] where he is their head hallelujah and
[3:11:23] all power belongs to him they are
[3:11:26] subject to him as the members of our
[3:11:29] bodies our subject our heads
[3:11:32] [Music]
[3:11:34] so our wife could be a bull head not
[3:11:37] subject to us gonna be bright in that
[3:11:39] sense you're not subject yourself to the
[3:11:43] ministry that why some people would jump
[3:11:46] from church to church they won't want to
[3:11:47] be under new subjection they want to be
[3:11:50] under new authority and to have
[3:11:55] authority you must be under Authority
[3:11:57] because God please meet up with
[3:12:00] authority
[3:12:00] but is only if you allow that authority
[3:12:03] to be over you
[3:12:12] no other men who abuse that authority
[3:12:15] that ministerial authority and govern
[3:12:18] people lies and runtiwa lies we do have
[3:12:20] that doctrine here with rather teaching
[3:12:22] here I like freedom I love freedom I
[3:12:26] want you to be free and I'ma be free you
[3:12:30] could be free but I had refuted telling
[3:12:31] the truth
[3:12:32] you can be free unbind me it's a working
[3:12:35] so it not working so I had to be careful
[3:12:42] and walk on eggshells because I want to
[3:12:45] offend this one and often that one it
[3:12:47] not so you know this is friend or no
[3:12:50] friend you know I love God God first
[3:12:54] this messages first I love us faith with
[3:12:57] it wrestle with it because they're gonna
[3:13:00] fight because cotton their behavior and
[3:13:02] their spirit and their attitude and they
[3:13:04] don't want to die
[3:13:05] some people love how they are that's why
[3:13:07] they're changing I hear where you say
[3:13:13] even or not a comment you know a comment
[3:13:16] Julian or where you say Amen I don't
[3:13:18] need a man for that I know some people
[3:13:20] are changing because they don't they
[3:13:22] don't want to change they love
[3:13:24] themselves they satisfied with
[3:13:27] themselves they're not hungry they're
[3:13:29] not thirsty they're not looking for
[3:13:31] transformation they just come at the
[3:13:33] church because it's a religious
[3:13:34] atmosphere that deliverin is a religious
[3:13:37] spirit upon them their illness means
[3:13:41] nothing the God their worship means
[3:13:42] nothing the God
