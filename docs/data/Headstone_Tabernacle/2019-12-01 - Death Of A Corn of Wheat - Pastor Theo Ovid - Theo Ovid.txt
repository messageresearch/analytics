you for this opportunity to be surrounded by angels driving us back to the Tree of Life driving us back to full access slower because you that's your desire for your sons in the last days now full access to power to strain to dominion designs the wonders the miracles the gifts and places we see it low we see it efrem here Judah here we see as I learned to be possessed we come to the help us tonight on speakers by a word they're just in my ask it amen and amen god bless FIFA Bibles we want to read to poor scriptures in John 12 one River was 22:24 and also sin John 15 who is one to eat scripture reading this evening we inform cynjohn 12 and there were certain Greeks among them that keep the worship at the feast the scene came therefore the Philip which was a business of Galilee and say Sodom saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip comment until it's uncommon again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered them saying they are is come that the Son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit all our scripture from Saint John chapter 15 I am The True Vine my father is the husbandman one every branch in me that beareth fruit he taketh away and every branch that bears fruit he pushes it that had made bring forth more fruit now you are clean to the world which are spoken to you abide in me and my Anna I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing you stop there priest well let's pray father we thank you for your scriptures may come and interpret an altar on our hearts in Jesus and I ask it amen and amen you will be seated so by the skipping we read the first scripture and Jesus saying except a corner we fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so to produce much fruit requires it it's not right and I'm his desire for us is to produce much fruit because the next scriptures say herein is my father glorified as it was eight that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples it's not right so his objective is not just to be on the tree as a vine his objective is not to be in height or bill no he has to be a fruit it's wanting to be connected but she connected for purpose you're connected to the vine that the life of the vine could fall to your branch because God no he needs the vine to be a fruit every bank and their fruit of itself a collab a fruit of itself but the vine used the channel of bran to be a fruit so he wants you to be an extension to produce fruit hallelujah he himself was the first fruit of them that slept he died to prove this resurrection power he died to prove that Suns gonna stay underground they could come up or glory to God and because I live he shall live also this is profit now and the gospel he said no watch he said we have nice okay yes we have nicely nomination nice our seminaries it's wonderful but Christ never told us to build any seminary or anything like that he said preach the gospel period and the gospel here we go isn't word only but true power and manifesting the Holy Spirit that I celebration don't like to talk about too much because his problems see because that these signs shall follow then I believe so anytime a has signs and wonders yeah Pentecostal this is all thing that the concerns was just getting a taste we moving into the real thing then what they were in person it says back there but this is not impersonation here dies my god are these long as I silence to see who would take the word believe the word die out and then produce fruit so when you see men come on dis no it has to be dead men it has to be men you become channel of God's inspiration to produce a manifestation this is what gives Singha you know she's gone sharing all this this is not that this is sons coming in position this is sons community business has come out to Dominion because we going back to even we are going back to Canaan land the destination is even is Jeremy long copy be a garden collie them a place called Eden a Garden of Eden we going back to Eden the trefoil mystery of God is to take us back to even that's why he reveal himself number 123 eminences number true and to get us back even so we have talked about the evenings condition we have to go back to evening dominion power because what are they even struggling to struggling to believe and you barely making it and Jesus talked about I came that you might have life and have it and have it and have it more abundantly not not not just run Tinley run they suddenly oh god this Christian thing oh yes no no I'm abundantly hallelujah glory of God but as I was talking about this man some signed by man who penny stores and it's not from nothing and he has boasts it's true Sai Baba you have all this blessing you're making offer to sai Baba whooping Sai Baba Baba a wallet and he please be forgotten by inside Baba and we have Jesus I didn't say I buy that all right but I know Jesus died and rose from the dead and the tacular money in hallelujah honey spirit has been released to come upon you to empower you we can enrich you we can transfer you Solomon was born in richest man annuity and God bless him not because he asks for money but because he asked for wisdom to manage God's people and God multiply him a man was a barren man I went up the

multiply what you have each of five loaves and two fishes and it multiplied what it had he could take what little you got and multiply what you had is panting look for miracles it's time to look for

because there are too low you know the good stone men they can say what we do know these he is because when they hear me talk about I greeted the Whitaker's for you want to fight how we do with no

even a thank God the power of the Cross the power of the blood and the devil camp a many can't break the poor [Applause] [Music] all right let's do a little bit now watch so therefore the gospel ISM will only but to power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit which which would produce these signs of mark 16 when he said go into all the world preach God's Word every creature these signs shall form them I believe the word itself is dead until it becomes into action and produce life no let's connect that to what Barham says may these men come after him and bring these words the light so God but the chemicals of the world in the world and leave it for spiritual inspired scientists to mix it together to create the atmosphere that the world to commit the action not everybody had these be gifts to mix to put it together to create the atmosphere hallelujah for the world to live and in every age Gautam anointed man that will take the same scriptures and as a reason and the dead as a doornail but when the right man comes along it is not dead it's alive because the gifts this year to bring it to life and you other gifts on you today the print is worth her life because you have the ability to give I got some good and you know this morning that you are pirate access to your healing to your breath true to your deliverance or get a lot of show Oh hallelujah let's continue I said I won again the word is surface dead until it becomes actionable so I'm pretty sure I'll concede all right as I spoke that way to do it when I asked for that have fondled me years ago do you could buy that which thou conceived pipe that to the dead it's enough for my answer so that would have to remain dormant when Mary come that was other jump up in because Mary on the scene when Mary don't know that what kind of high honor that we'll have to find her just as the word from you when Malachi say he DoCoMo William Branham shall turn the hearts of the children back to the father's that were children dear was speaking about a particular people in Malachi I make no mistake when he said children you know he was talking about a certain generation a certain people it to be you [Applause] Malachi prophesied at hundreds of years William Branham born more than fifty years but we still here with this prophecy hanging over you he shall turn the hearts of the children that's a guarantee that says

cast upon it anything the way you want it perhaps the egg it's not the end it's the atmosphere you yourself as a human Caledonia and that'll make you one small chicken the chicken it will hatch the egg it is the atmosphere that the student he said it will produce a chicken just the same and I don't care where it's under the Methodists Baptists Presbyterians the atmosphere of the world which is the egg in the right most fear will produce a born-again child God the right atmosphere is not for you to sit down stiff with hands folded and I know I can't shake it like if something goes in your hand that is not the atmosphere that is not the atmosphere in the upper room nobody was just here or on when they go come how long will come in here that puts no chilling now pushing nothing one man I

baby Jesus shake that off until God you mean you're something - okay - yeah everybody jumping I jump in - yes whatever they do not do well - you can I want to be in the atmosphere and when the day of

when you have fire all that tax is an email see for tell me that you pick up one time you know yeah I wide open you gonna be with us I know because you know from the level of subconscious beside everything you take the fire will burn you on this very night so you a couch thickens about sleepy going to poverty with a little away so you can't talk about fire so you see a lot of things is in US but they need to be activated in a stop adrenaline I when you're in danger when something frightened me saying how to run a bandit come anything and you how to think what I'm not your run you might want to take your wallet or take something you stick on like a policy escape him till you're bitten any runnin runnin much always because the Remo speed I know what's it because happen to me myself just fast common enjoys steps a teasing a man with some dogs that was just our own kind of tease be mine Lucy dogs and listening I was only seen two steps it was the one step you know I was skipping steps with is until where I went to decide on top of all cook because I own dogs we not so friendly way from you know but these are dogs goin don't beat me when I was smaller wasn't was a nice

got another brick sure everybody's saying it can make it caddies you you can putter with them yeah generally moving it's a chemical reaction that were when you had also awesome George is a chemical reaction causing chance and tumor inside a beer ate all that that's how when I started forgiveness when I'm talk about the scientists I was Shane Hartigan wife and I wouldn't finish me all of it but there's talk money power of gratefulness and his power of thankfulness and they did that experiment people writing thank you notes and so on and the CD up on the Berean imagine you have a great effect
