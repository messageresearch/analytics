[14:01] Jesus name I ask it and father as we
[14:03] approach your word tonight may you speak
[14:05] to our hearts and give us that bur of
[14:07] prayer Lord you said because of iniquity
[14:11] the love of many will wax for help us
[14:14] tonight that our hearts will be so
[14:16] stirred to love you more and that
[14:18] beautiful song Lord I give you my heart
[14:21] my soul and if we could only live to
[14:23] glorify you what a difference it would
[14:26] make in what we see in how we act how we
[14:28] live and what we do interpret the word
[14:31] to our hearts Lord because you are your
[14:33] own interpreter granted God in Jesus
[14:35] name I ask it amen and amen God bless
[14:39] you and God be with you tonight and if
[14:41] you have your Bibles I like you to turn
[14:44] to Proverbs Chapter
[14:45] 14 we want to read four verses there 1
[14:51] to4 Proverbs Chapter
[14:54] 41-4 I'll read verse four first then
[14:57] I'll go back to verse one the four reads
[14:59] where no Ox are the crib is clean but
[15:03] much increased is by the strength of the
[15:07] ox now this scripture this verse was
[15:09] given to me my son Andrew and it just
[15:12] red me since he spoke it and I went to
[15:14] see the context of it where uh what is
[15:17] around it and that is where it was
[15:21] placed this verse four let's go to verse
[15:23] one every wise woman build it her
[15:26] house but the foolish pluck it down with
[15:31] her hands he that walth in his
[15:33] uprightness fear of the Lord but he that
[15:36] is perverse in his ways despised him in
[15:41] the mouth of the foolish is a rod of
[15:44] Pride but the lips of the wise shall
[15:48] preserve them where no oxen are the CRI
[15:52] is clean but much
[15:54] increased is by the strength of the ox
[15:58] may God bless his word
[16:00] and as we want to share something before
[16:02] we get on with prayer
[16:03] tonight that first verse here oh so what
[16:06] I have is four sayings that's the title
[16:08] I have four sayings Proverbs 14
[16:13] 1-4 and the first one every wise woman
[16:17] builted a house but the foolish pled it
[16:21] down with her hands as you would know
[16:24] Andre and I we would have to do
[16:26] counseling marriage counseling over the
[16:28] years
[16:29] different couples come go and different
[16:31] things like that and this scripture was
[16:34] so applicable to uh a family that we did
[16:39] and the wife the sister was just
[16:42] terrible in her own house just trying to
[16:45] break down whatever the husband do
[16:46] trying to break him like break his
[16:48] spirit and what she really trying to do
[16:49] is to bring her husband under her
[16:52] subjection actually the Bible call a
[16:55] woman that pluck it down her own house
[16:58] with her own hands is a foolish woman
[17:01] because the man was placed by God
[17:03] functionally for a purpose which is not
[17:06] just a lead doesn't lead but to be a
[17:08] priest in the house so the Bible call a
[17:11] wise woman the one who builds one who
[17:14] uplifts one who inspires that is how she
[17:19] builds a house and I'm seeing the same
[17:20] thing with the foolish CH members
[17:24] pulling on the church pulling on the
[17:26] church plucking it down to their own
[17:28] family and
[17:29] others pulling down the ministry pulling
[17:32] down what the church is striving for
[17:34] what the church want to accomplish and
[17:36] in doing that the same church later on
[17:39] they want to look for help and for
[17:40] prayer and for deliverance and viritual
[17:42] but they already pull it down in their
[17:44] own hearts and Minds verse two he that
[17:48] walth in his uprightness fearth the Lord
[17:51] but he that is perverse in his ways
[17:53] despises him now I know something hard
[17:57] to think but but there are people that
[17:59] go to church that hate God that against
[18:02] God and they are against God and hate
[18:05] God by their actions and their words and
[18:06] the attitude and that word
[18:09] perverse perverse is contrary to what is
[18:13] right from Good Wicked or depraved it is
[18:19] characterized by a resulting from
[18:21] willful opposition or resistance to what
[18:24] is Right expected or reasonable there
[18:27] some people so say something they want
[18:29] to oppose they don't know what they want
[18:31] to oppose they just want to oppose they
[18:32] just want to have a different view to
[18:35] appear to be different and that perverse
[18:39] it continues
[18:40] willfully opposing or resisting what is
[18:44] Right expected or reasonable Paul Paul
[18:48] in Acts 20 he said take it unto
[18:51] yourselves and to all the flu over which
[18:54] the Holy Ghost had made you overseers
[18:57] and before that he just say I have not
[18:58] to declare unto you the counsel of God
[19:01] and he exalted the ministry to feed the
[19:04] Church of God which had purchased with
[19:06] his own blood for no this and Paul was
[19:09] prophesying after my departing shall
[19:11] Grievous wordss enter in among you not
[19:15] sparing the flocks now the wolf doesn't
[19:17] come in and have a label on his head I'm
[19:19] a grievous wolf no the Grievious wolf
[19:22] doesn't come with a label and a title no
[19:25] they come just ordinary but what you say
[19:28] but also know of your own selves that's
[19:31] among them shall men arise speaking
[19:33] perverse things purpose what is the
[19:37] purpose of all these Mighty Revelations
[19:38] and Inspirations and so on to draw away
[19:41] disciples after them so at the end of
[19:44] the day it's all about self flesh and
[19:48] that piece of beef that they want to
[19:50] parade so this is what this is about
[19:53] Paul speaking about men speaking things
[19:55] you wonder how could it be but this is
[19:57] the prophecy vers three of the same
[20:00] scripture we read in the mouth of the
[20:02] foolish is a rod of Pride but the lips
[20:06] of the wise shall preserve them and in
[20:10] the Proverbs 15:7 I would just want to
[20:12] really amplifi it says the lips of the
[20:15] wise dispers knowledge sifting it a
[20:19] shaft from the green not so the minds
[20:24] and hearts of the self-confident and the
[20:27] foolish so the foolish genuinely lacks
[20:32] discernment they don't have that sifting
[20:35] to know you know what right if from
[20:37] wrong the changing of things so the mou
[20:40] of the foolish it speaks about the
[20:43] speech and the words of someone that
[20:45] lacks wisdom and
[20:47] understanding and these kind and type of
[20:51] individuals they speak things that are
[20:53] negative they speak things that have
[20:56] effect and consequences both to
[20:58] themselves and others but let's go to
[21:01] the last verse here verse
[21:03] four where no Au are the CRI is clean no
[21:08] Ox things thck and span but much
[21:12] increased is by the strength of the ox
[21:15] so this proverb is a reflection of a
[21:18] tradeoff between cleanliness and
[21:21] productivity a clean crib or manger it
[21:26] implies or infers new
[21:29] no oxen around but when you have a oxen
[21:33] they are variable for plowing for
[21:35] producing crops and everything else in
[21:38] other words you have to balance whether
[21:41] you want the place TIY and clean with
[21:43] new oin or productivity and increase so
[21:47] if you don't have an ox you mean that
[21:50] you are short of the benefits and
[21:54] productivity that the ox provide
[21:59] so when I when the scripture was soaking
[22:02] down I was thinking about it or
[22:04] meditating on it I recognized around
[22:06] progress you find things could be quite
[22:09] messy let me repeat that along the way
[22:12] of progress things could be quite messy
[22:16] and then I want to just go down to
[22:18] something what I call confrontational
[22:21] Christianity confrontational
[22:23] Christianity to confront to confront
[22:27] means to face to meet or deal with a
[22:31] situation especially a difficult or
[22:33] challenging one directly or without
[22:37] avoiding it it can involve addressing a
[22:40] problem issue or person directly and
[22:45] often implies a degree of conflict or
[22:49] disagreement that needs to be resolved
[22:52] or address now the Bible itself is a
[22:55] confrontational book Christianity is a
[22:58] foundational thing that's why John the
[23:00] Baptist spoke to the Scribe and phares
[23:02] he did that is why Jesus spoke to the
[23:05] Scribe and phes way he did you ripped
[23:07] through them he was confrontational he
[23:10] went into the temples he beat out the
[23:12] money changers he did what he had to do
[23:15] now go
[23:19] BR persecution and
[23:21] trials are a
[23:24] natural normal part of the Christian
[23:27] Life
[23:29] so you don't have to make it a loud
[23:31] noise of stuff that you're going through
[23:35] in this life this supposed to be natural
[23:38] you have days of
[23:40] sunshine you have days of
[23:43] rain sometime you're preparing for the
[23:45] rain you want the rain but when the rain
[23:48] comes mud to comes uh the trees being
[23:53] wet and and overflowing drains and so on
[23:56] it have consequences of all what we need
[24:00] to deal with so I want to establish this
[24:03] here as a line
[24:05] persecution and trial are a
[24:10] natural normal part of the Christian
[24:14] Life and if this have not been a natural
[24:16] part of your life that you have been so
[24:18] blessed that you can't be stressed
[24:20] everything has working out smooth for
[24:21] you you have to look again at your
[24:23] Christianity because this is just part
[24:24] of the package there's only one thing
[24:27] you can do about then yeah we go Saints
[24:30] commit them all to God judge not leave
[24:34] their outworking and final judgment to
[24:36] him instead of putting your mouth and
[24:38] loosing your mouth and saying things
[24:40] that you should not say about what
[24:42] you're going through and why you're
[24:43] going through it why
[24:46] not zip up and commit them to God and
[24:51] leave the outw and fining judgment in
[24:54] him so he continues
[24:57] here thou c not bear them which are evil
[25:01] and thou triy them which say the
[25:03] apostles and are not as found them Liars
[25:06] these Ephesians
[25:08] believed that God's people ought to be
[25:11] holy do you believe that
[25:13] tonight do you really believe that
[25:16] tonight and we supposed to be another
[25:18] Ephesians right these Ephesians believe
[25:22] that God's people ought to be holy
[25:25] according to this verse it took steps to
[25:28] keep the body unle from sin most
[25:30] evidently the apostasy had already
[25:33] started sin had entered into the church
[25:35] and they were obedient to the words of
[25:37] Paul when he said to put away the wicked
[25:40] from amongst them they were a separated
[25:43] people they had come out of the world
[25:45] and now they won't going to let the
[25:47] world enter amongst them amongst them
[25:51] each one of us is to protect the church
[25:54] from the world entering in that in that
[25:56] sense they would not put up with sin in
[25:59] the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with
[26:02] them or a figure of speech it was a way
[26:05] of life and I told a pastor in Miami I
[26:08] said they have to turned down the volume
[26:10] knob on the life they turn that down and
[26:14] they raised the volume on Mysteries
[26:17] Revelations Inspirations knowledge and
[26:21] that is what they raised in the volume
[26:23] on so the volume of life has been turned
[26:26] down you don't have to live anything you
[26:28] just in the message they turn on the
[26:30] Life Volume and raise up the Mysteries
[26:33] histories and knowledge and information
[26:35] how they know more than others but these
[26:39] Ephesians Holiness wasn't a phrase with
[26:41] them or figure speech it was a way of
[26:44] life let let's
[26:46] go D Tri them that say they Apostles and
[26:49] are not but has found them as Liars M
[26:53] that's a blunt statement th trying them
[26:56] who call Apostles so these these
[26:58] Believers were confrontational Believers
[27:01] isn't that a presumption what speaking
[27:04] what right as a people to try those who
[27:07] call themselves Apostles and how do they
[27:09] try them oh I love this here in
[27:11] Galatians 1 18 but though we want angel
[27:14] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[27:17] you that that which we have already
[27:19] preached unto you let him be a curse it
[27:22] was the apostles who brought the
[27:24] original word to the people note the
[27:26] word original that original word could
[27:29] not change even a DOT or a dash of it
[27:34] Paul knew it was God's who Paul knew it
[27:38] was God who had spoken to him so he said
[27:42] even if now this is important even if I
[27:45] come and try to bring a second
[27:47] Revelation try to make one little change
[27:50] in what I give originally let me be a
[27:53] cur you see Paul knew that the first
[27:56] revelation was correct God can't give a
[28:00] first revelation then a second
[28:02] Revelation if he did he would be
[28:04] changing his mind he can give a
[28:06] revelation and add to it as he did in
[28:09] the Garden of Eden when he promised a
[28:11] seed to the woman and then later
[28:12] designated that seed come true Abraham
[28:15] and then later said it could come
[28:16] through the same bloodline in David but
[28:18] it was the same Revelation it only gave
[28:20] more more information to help them
[28:23] receive and understand it but God's word
[28:26] can't change the seed came exactly as
[28:29] revealed and you see what those false
[28:31] prophets were doing they came with their
[28:34] own word but the clance it's so good
[28:36] that I found it I've been saying it for
[28:38] years and somehow I must have missed
[28:40] this little line here but I keep saying
[28:42] men preaching their own thoughts and
[28:44] sprinkling a little Malachi 14 like
[28:47] pepper sauce or like ketchup on this on
[28:49] this meal that they preparing but they
[28:51] already fixing up their own thing they
[28:52] really bring in their own word those
[28:55] Ephesians knew what word
[28:58] as Paul had taught it they were full of
[29:01] the Holy Ghost by the lay of Paul's
[29:02] hands they looked those false Apostles
[29:05] in the eye and said you are not saying
[29:07] what Paul said you are therefore false
[29:10] that sets my heart on fire he says get
[29:13] back to the word it is not you that
[29:15] really tries the Apostle and the prophet
[29:17] and teacher it is the word that tries
[29:19] them one of these days there's going to
[29:22] come a prophet to the lou and church age
[29:24] and you know if he is the real one sent
[29:27] from God or not yes you will for it is
[29:29] he he is of God he will be in that word
[29:32] exactly as God give it and he won't
[29:36] deviate from it at word one moment not
[29:39] by one iota in the last age then when
[29:42] you will be there will be many false
[29:44] prophets appearing watch and see how
[29:46] they keep telling you that if you don't
[29:48] believe them and what they say you will
[29:50] be lost but when that last day Prophet
[29:53] comes on the scene he truly a prophet he
[29:56] will be crying get back to the when you
[29:58] are lost so you see false anointed bind
[30:01] the people to themselves by fear these
[30:05] false
[30:06] Apostles are the Grievious words that
[30:09] Paul spoke of he said once I am gone
[30:12] they will try to come and claim equal
[30:14] Revelation but their purpose is not to
[30:17] help you but destroy you acts 2037 2732
[30:22] for I have not shown to declare unto you
[30:24] the whole counil of God and then you
[30:26] talk about uh ws and T to flock speaking
[30:29] perverse things their own word and ideas
[30:32] are not God to show disciples unto
[30:35] themselves all right so already they
[30:37] were denying the word setting up their
[30:39] own Creeds and philosophies instead of
[30:41] the word now here we go going to close
[30:45] we all know that the Bible teaches the
[30:47] new birth and they substitute handshakes
[30:49] and everything else for the new birth
[30:51] but it will never take the place of the
[30:52] new birth it's got to be an experience a
[30:55] born again we all know that anything of
[30:59] a bir is a mess when a baby is born it's
[31:01] whether is on the floor hospital it's a
[31:03] rest now watch he says it's the baptism
[31:07] of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret
[31:10] of the real believing Church born again
[31:15] oh I know you get up from the altar
[31:17] crying and boohoo and squeezing
[31:19] squealing and slobbering but it brings
[31:22] life here what he describe in the
[31:25] message now is just amen hallelujah amen
[31:28] Glory One Clap something he's talking
[31:30] about from the altar crying and boohoo
[31:33] and sing and slobbering but it brings
[31:36] life it takes the starch out of you it
[31:39] makes you something that you ought to be
[31:42] it takes all the world and stiff neck
[31:44] out to you and today we just walk up and
[31:47] say I take Jesus as my personal savior
[31:49] that will never take the place of your
[31:52] new birth and when men and women come to
[31:54] the Altar and forget where they are and
[31:57] who's around them until they really die
[31:59] out here we go and are born again only
[32:03] like meetings and the power of the Holy
[32:04] Ghost get back into the church again
[32:06] that's what we need today a good old St
[32:09] Paul Revival the Bible Holy Ghost I like
[32:13] that Bible Holy Ghost preach back in
[32:15] power yet in Simplicity or preaching the
[32:18] power of the Resurrection almost done
[32:21] all
[32:22] right so Paul said I didn't come with
[32:25] you with wisdom but I come to you with
[32:26] preaching of power when we substitute
[32:29] other things and get classy and starchy
[32:31] and stiff we are losing the very secret
[32:35] our lucks are being Shield what's the
[32:38] matter with Christian church today they
[32:40] try to accept some manufactured way it
[32:42] won't work it try to it you'll kill the
[32:46] patient your baby God's Baby by trying
[32:49] to manufacture some way there's no need
[32:52] yeah so he's dramatizing there's no need
[32:54] of this boohoo and crying there's no
[32:56] need of all this and that
[32:58] there's no need of this dying unless we
[33:02] unless there's a death there can be a
[33:04] birth bir only comes by the substance of
[33:07] death Leisa Corner fall in the ground
[33:09] and die he said and that's the way we
[33:11] must die die to ourselves and be born a
[33:14] new of the Holy Spirit I heard I sure
[33:16] you heard me and hear us talk about di
[33:19] diet if you don't get what that means
[33:22] ask God say say Lord tonight what it is
[33:26] to die to myself this week here Christ
[33:29] Ministry they B hosana hosana hosana
[33:32] next week Easter time they say crucify
[33:34] crucify crucify but he himself knew he
[33:37] came to die to pay that
[33:39] price so I'm closing with this scripture
[33:43] here okay okay now they haven't found a
[33:46] better way for chicken to get out the
[33:47] shell but to Peck it way out he say God
[33:50] provides the instrument for the chicken
[33:52] to free himself in the Bible talk about
[33:54] the kingdom is preacher of a man PR you
[33:56] have to pick out
[33:58] if you say they're stiff as a DA stiff
[34:00] in your own human self you're vexed
[34:02] you're upset you don't like this if get
[34:04] raise a pay or some kind of blessing you
[34:06] feel happy if something get cut from you
[34:07] you feel sad it's just you that's normal
[34:10] human behavior but we are not normal
[34:12] human we have a word to believe a word
[34:13] to receive so Paul said this in this
[34:16] scripture here this from 1 Timothy 6 he
[34:19] says let us as many servants as are
[34:21] under the Yoke Count Their Own Masters
[34:23] worthy of all honor that the name of God
[34:26] and his Doctrine be not be B
[34:28] and they have been and they have had
[34:30] believing Masters let them not despise
[34:32] him because they are Brethren but rather
[34:35] do them service because they are
[34:37] faithful and beloving partakers of the
[34:39] benefit these things teach and exalt If
[34:42] any man Teach otherwise and consent to
[34:45] the wholesome word so God address
[34:47] servants God address Masters it doesn't
[34:50] matter if you are servant or you are
[34:52] Master you it is addressed by the word
[34:55] of God that the doctrine will not BL If
[34:58] any man Teach otherwise so he is saying
[35:01] men will teach but they're supposed to
[35:03] teach according to the wholesome
[35:05] Doctrine If any man Teach otherwise and
[35:08] consent not to Wholesome words even the
[35:11] words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to
[35:13] the doctrine which is according to
[35:14] Godliness here how Paul described this
[35:17] man that is teaching he is proud knowing
[35:20] nothing but doting about questions and
[35:23] stri of words whereof commit Envy Strife
[35:26] railings
[35:28] that's the production of that kind of
[35:30] teaching perverse disput of men's of
[35:32] corrupt Minds destitute of the truth
[35:35] supposing that gain is godliness from
[35:38] such withdraw thyself and look at the
[35:40] balance Paul bring with much of the ox
[35:43] has increase but godliness verse six
[35:47] with contentment is great gain for we
[35:49] brought nothing into this world and is
[35:51] certain we can carry nothing out and
[35:54] having F and reignment let us therefore
[35:56] be there with be content they that will
[35:59] be rich fall into temptation and a snare
[36:01] and into many foolish and hurtful lust
[36:04] which dra men in destruction and pedes
[36:07] For the Love of Money not money itself
[36:10] the love of it the love of many is the
[36:13] root of all evil some people love money
[36:15] that's why they have no friends because
[36:16] they don't want to share they don't want
[36:17] to give they and they and the family and
[36:20] circle there and they end up lonely and
[36:22] terrible and have a whole ton of money
[36:24] makes no sense for the love of money is
[36:26] the root of all evil which some coveted
[36:30] after they have heard from the fate and
[36:34] pierced themselves through with many
[36:36] Sorrows but thou oh man of God flee
[36:39] these things and follow after what
[36:42] righteousness godliness Faith love
[36:45] patience and meekness may God bless his
[36:48] word tonight I trust you were helped and
[36:50] you were edified where there's no
[36:53] auction the stable is clean but where
[36:56] there is you have the prodction there's
[36:58] productivity around being productive
[37:01] because this is what the talent is about
[37:03] 10 talents five talents one Talent the
[37:05] man bury it he was cool he didn't study
[37:07] what going on he know it buried already
[37:09] just had to show the Master look where
[37:11] it buried he wasn't productive he didn't
[37:13] increase he say add to your faith virtue
[37:15] and virt knowledge God don't want us to
[37:18] come and say Lord you pick me up so and
[37:20] you meet me so Daddy very daddy want
[37:22] Talent he wants a productive life he
[37:25] want increase into life if we are going
[37:28] to increase stretch aim at accomplish
[37:32] there's going to be rough shavings just
[37:34] like a man theying Furniture whatever
[37:37] business you're doing whatever stuff
[37:39] you're doing spiritual or natural
[37:41] they're going to be mess around you
[37:43] don't let the mess stop you be your
[37:46] best and face the test let's bow our
[37:49] hands almighty God I thank you for your
[37:51] word today these four sayings in this
[37:54] Proverbs Chapter 14 Lord I Thank you for
[37:56] the scripture this scripture truly is a
[37:58] guide the scriptures truly is
[38:00] instructive the scriptures could truly
[38:02] speak to our hearts in every area of Our
[38:05] Lives father as the people get in prayer
[38:07] may they understand that this death is
[38:10] real to die out itself Jesus didn't
[38:13] imagine he was dying he knew he was came
[38:16] to service to die and we too have to die
[38:19] that that word can come alive and
[38:21] manifest it in our hearts we have
[38:23] something to press forward tonight oh
[38:25] God we don't want the coolness of the
[38:26] message yeah in the message 30 40 plus
[38:29] years and dull and numb and can't be
[38:32] move and persuaded anymore we want our
[38:35] hearts to be warm want our hearts to be
[38:37] gentle and have a real heart towards you
[38:40] the question is when last have we cry
[38:42] when last have we wait on us of your
[38:45] goodness and your mercy when last have
[38:46] we have we confessed and repented of our
[38:49] our unfaithfulness our lack of trust in
[38:51] you we say we believe you but we don't
[38:53] express it in terms of trust trusting
[38:55] you for finances trusting you for our
[38:57] bread for our water for our food for our
[39:00] covering trusting you in all things
[39:02] because when we demonstrate trust it
[39:04] shows that we really believe you because
[39:06] you are the leader you are the guide you
[39:09] our strength Lord when we fall back in
[39:11] tears and in in in a depression and
