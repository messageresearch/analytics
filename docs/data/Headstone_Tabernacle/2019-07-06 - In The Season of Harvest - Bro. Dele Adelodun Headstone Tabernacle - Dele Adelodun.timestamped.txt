[52:56] going to read from few places if you
[52:59] don't mind we'll start from the book of
[53:02] John chapter 12
[53:09] John since John chapter 12
[53:15] I would like to read from the 28 verse
[53:19] down to 24 John 12 22 24
[53:26] then we shall also read from the book of
[53:28] Matthew chapter 27 to 28 somewhere there
[53:34] if you are there say hey man
[53:38] and there we are certain Greeks among
[53:40] them that came up to worship at the
[53:43] feast the same came therefore to
[53:46] Philippi which was of Bethsaida of
[53:49] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[53:54] will see Jesus
[53:56] Philip common tantalate and row and
[53:59] again hundra and Philip tell Jesus
[54:07] to come that is son of man should be
[54:15] I set a corn of wheat fall into the
[54:18] ground and
[54:22] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[54:26] fruit the wake on of weed econ can ever
[54:31] multiply itself it's by dying I will
[54:36] come back to that
[54:37] god bless you Matthew chapter 27
[54:47] this might be a very hot text now in
[54:50] Matthew 27 for the kind of the theme of
[54:53] our program but you bear with me as we
[54:59] see we are it matches
[55:03] Matthew 27 I'd like to take from the 60
[55:07] second verse 62 now the next day that
[55:12] followed the day of the preparation the
[55:16] chief priests and Pharisees came
[55:17] together unto Pilate saying sir we
[55:22] remember that that deceiver said while
[55:26] he was yet alive after three days our
[55:29] eyes again I'm sure you know they are
[55:34] referring to command therefore that the
[55:38] sepulchre be made sure until the third
[55:41] day lest his disciples came by night and
[55:45] steal him away and say unto the people
[55:49] he is risen from the dead so the last
[55:53] arrow shall be worse than the first
[55:57] Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go
[56:01] your way
[56:02] make it as sure as you can so they went
[56:05] and made the sepulchre sure sealing the
[56:09] stone and setting a watch I will
[56:13] continue to 28 the first six verses in
[56:16] the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[56:18] dawn toward the first day of the week
[56:20] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[56:24] to see the sepulchre
[56:27] and behold there was a great earthquake
[56:30] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[56:33] heaven and came and rolled back the
[56:37] stone from the door and such upon it he
[56:41] didn't just roll it away is such his
[56:45] countenance was like lightning and his
[56:47] raiment white as snow and for fear of
[56:51] him
[56:51] the keepers who were meant to be on
[56:54] guard with the seal with all the cameras
[56:56] did shake and became as
[57:36] me to come to Trinidad to be of service
[57:40] trusting to God that song we along the
[57:42] line we can be of a blessing and I very
[57:46] much appreciate the support of my dear
[57:48] friend and brother Isaac it did all he
[57:51] could to get me down here without
[57:55] frustration so maybe not bless you sir
[58:00] and in absentia I want to appreciate
[58:04] past Oulu Emoto ample for only support
[58:08] for me to be done here he hasn't come
[58:11] yet
[58:12] boy in this great brother-in-law van
[58:14] kindness it was about
[58:17] it's underway so I pretty low blessing
[58:20] very much and I appreciate all the
[58:28] servants of the Lord
[58:29] pastors both doors that will speak and
[58:34] those that were supports the speakers I
[58:37] appreciate every one of you for your
[58:40] grace for your humility for your support
[58:42] for your kindness and for your
[58:45] generosity to come up a part of these
[58:47] meetings I pray the Lord bless every one
[58:50] of you appreciate the entire church for
[58:57] coming like I've always said when a
[59:01] preacher comes to town it is not our
[59:04] intention to come and preach to chairs
[59:06] and benches the gospel is not meant for
[59:09] them the gospel is meant for human
[59:12] beings so it's always a blessing and an
[59:15] encouragement to a preacher when the
[59:17] Lord give us people to speak to so we
[59:20] will never take your kindness that
[59:23] gesture for granted so we trust to the
[59:26] Lord that somewhere somehow we'll be of
[59:28] a blessing to you
[59:30] so thank you for coming tonight thank
[59:32] you for coming in the morning I'm taking
[59:35] an advance for how the community we do
[59:37] throughout these meetings may God bless
[59:40] you
[59:42] I bring greetings from Nigeria all the
[59:47] saints the pastors and everyone and my
[59:52] own past oh and all the Brethren knew of
[59:56] my comment told me to give you a very
[59:59] kind regards to all the sins here and my
[1:00:03] wife and children also requested that I
[1:00:06] greet every one of you
[1:00:08] everyone is doing fine and I'm sure they
[1:00:11] will be glad to know that the believers
[1:00:13] are doing where he made a lot less young
[1:00:17] [Applause]
[1:00:24] and I sincerely know that all of you
[1:00:26] appreciated the service this morning the
[1:00:34] yield increased
[1:00:36] to show to us that lessons and not being
[1:00:39] protected there was something and when
[1:00:44] Pastor crimp read in the morning it said
[1:00:47] we are unprotected here protected and I
[1:00:51] find our protection to be that perfect
[1:00:53] law if we can be yielding and yielding
[1:00:56] and yielding it will be taking us from
[1:00:59] glory to glory but that was something to
[1:01:02] my heart this morning and I pretty low
[1:01:05] bless you sir bless the family the
[1:01:08] ministry and the flock of God Park and
[1:01:11] England amen god bless you all
[1:01:14] if I do not if I do not greet anyone I
[1:01:18] shall have greeted forgive me it is not
[1:01:21] out of rudeness it's just because this
[1:01:24] is so much I can do right now god bless
[1:01:26] you so if the Lord will be our help
[1:01:30] tonight which I trust a will I want to
[1:01:35] speak on
[1:01:38] the subjects that I called in this
[1:01:40] season of the harvest like pastor
[1:01:44] Chandler said this morning that the
[1:01:46] harvest time is a very broad subject and
[1:01:49] it can be approached from several many
[1:01:53] angles because there are a lot of things
[1:01:55] that go into the harvest what I'm
[1:01:58] trusting to God that you know the
[1:02:00] scripture says the body of Christ is
[1:02:03] compacted together by what every joint
[1:02:07] supply so if the two of us tonight are
[1:02:11] not able to give adequate supply don't
[1:02:15] worry there are still five more supplies
[1:02:17] coming and I'm sure they will be able to
[1:02:19] fill in you wouldn't miss anything you
[1:02:23] watch to receive through these meetings
[1:02:26] so be less the short of that may I start
[1:02:29] even this other subject by saying that
[1:02:33] all your efforts to come and everything
[1:02:37] that you put in to come is like seed
[1:02:40] sowing
[1:02:41] that's what the Prophet said brother
[1:02:44] Brahma wants to preach in a place in
[1:02:47] Canada very remote many years ago and
[1:02:50] there was telling the church before he
[1:02:53] went is a see those brethren they and
[1:02:56] their remote parts and they do not have
[1:02:58] much so for them to make it to the
[1:03:01] meetings because of the value they
[1:03:03] attach to those meetings some of them
[1:03:05] will have to sell their asses
[1:03:07] there are cut rules and so forth some of
[1:03:09] them will have to each eye some of them
[1:03:11] will have to combine transportation with
[1:03:14] element of walking in order to get to
[1:03:17] the meetings and the prophet tour
[1:03:19] discharge is that you see that is how to
[1:03:22] get much out of it because what they do
[1:03:26] goes with one form of sacrifice or the
[1:03:29] other those that sow in tears most
[1:03:32] certainly reap in joy so it's that they
[1:03:37] are putting in so much because of the
[1:03:39] value they attach to that program and is
[1:03:42] that that is the reason they usually get
[1:03:44] so so much so I want to tell you for all
[1:03:49] the sacrifices you have made you will
[1:03:51] get so so much the harvest will begin
[1:03:55] with you your comfort shall be full by
[1:03:59] the time that meetings are over you will
[1:04:01] count your blessings and it will
[1:04:03] surprise you what the Lord has done
[1:04:06] just open your hearts to receive the
[1:04:09] blessings of God if you have a spiritual
[1:04:12] niche the law will may teach you say why
[1:04:14] because you have son
[1:04:16] you've got to read if you have a
[1:04:18] physical needs the law will meet it car
[1:04:21] valley takes care both way brother brown
[1:04:24] said if you can save your soul
[1:04:26] it can also heal your body it can meet
[1:04:29] your needs
[1:04:30] it can fight your battles so let loose
[1:04:32] in his presence and I'm sure there'll be
[1:04:35] a lot of
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:39] you love him tonight I was thinking of
[1:04:44] the men that brother Bram called John
[1:04:46] cherish just bear with me this is how I
[1:04:49] feel like going and when the Prophet met
[1:04:53] this man it was such a poor man it
[1:04:58] wasn't only poor life was so unfair to
[1:05:00] him it was married but he had no child
[1:05:03] so everything to the negative was the
[1:05:07] portion of this brother
[1:05:08] but brother Bram meets some a statement
[1:05:12] that was very remarkably by John cherish
[1:05:14] is that when this man eats the word it
[1:05:17] believed everything and the power of the
[1:05:23] fridge in the world began to propel him
[1:05:25] John Charlie was no longer himself then
[1:05:29] you know it was living like in the true
[1:05:31] room house that he has used all his
[1:05:34] entire life savings and walking to
[1:05:37] acquire but then because of the value
[1:05:40] attached to the gospel a man of God came
[1:05:44] into the town to settle down and spread
[1:05:47] the gospel a fairlead of the Lord this
[1:05:50] will sound unusual to many of us it will
[1:05:53] sound like a man out of his mind people
[1:05:56] take out of what they have but John
[1:05:59] chariot was gonna take out of nothing
[1:06:02] she was gonna be like that with a woman
[1:06:05] she dropped all our two minds that's all
[1:06:08] she had
[1:06:09] and Jesus said she went for much more
[1:06:12] wattage than those who brought millions
[1:06:15] it's because there are millions came out
[1:06:18] of their billions is that what this one
[1:06:21] came out of nothing
[1:06:22] it is 2-2 it left her with zero but
[1:06:27] because of the value she attached beauty
[1:06:33] of open things a channel Oh glory to God
[1:06:39] John carats left his house and brother
[1:06:42] Branson is got a very godly wife who
[1:06:46] made life easy for him they left the
[1:06:49] house completely not as a loan or as a
[1:06:52] range they ended it completely as a gift
[1:06:56] to the men of God without a plan for
[1:07:00] where they we pass the night the man of
[1:07:03] God struggle to refuse it
[1:07:05] but John said the Lord told me to do
[1:07:08] this so John stood right there and he
[1:07:12] had to I by net squatted somewhere for
[1:07:15] the night and when a woman who never
[1:07:18] knew God she wasn't a Christian when she
[1:07:23] saw them it said I was going on here
[1:07:25] it said it was happy to declare
[1:07:27] testimony the Lord told me to do this
[1:07:30] and I've done so what is left for you
[1:07:32] John it said nothing
[1:07:33] it said okay you know what I will give
[1:07:35] you my garage to stay if you will pay
[1:07:38] the wages of dressing my cutting
[1:07:41] so it's going to cultivate dress and
[1:07:45] make the garden okay but the payment it
[1:07:49] will receive for dressing the garden
[1:07:51] will be the garage is given to leave
[1:07:55] John gladly accepted it and the John
[1:07:58] will dress the garden and in the evening
[1:08:00] you know and after doing that it will go
[1:08:03] and look for something to do in the
[1:08:04] evening it will sit somewhere by the
[1:08:06] compound of the house and start reading
[1:08:09] his Bible then this woman begins to pay
[1:08:12] attention to John what was in that book
[1:08:17] that makes this man so loved and so
[1:08:20] interested every time without John
[1:08:25] Charlie's saying one word his life began
[1:08:28] to preach and the woman you know peeped
[1:08:33] to see what book he was reading and it
[1:08:36] turned out to be a Bible and the woman
[1:08:38] went to the shop to buy a save a Bible
[1:08:40] and start reading also I want to know
[1:08:45] what was John's interest what was
[1:08:48] attracting John in that book and she
[1:08:53] started reading Bible and by the time
[1:08:56] she started reading Bible the lot began
[1:08:58] to minister to her and that opened up a
[1:09:02] channel for this woman to hear from God
[1:09:04] and the same God who spoke to John spoke
[1:09:07] to her
[1:09:14] and and is that God give John $10,000
[1:09:20] and this woman who has never been to
[1:09:24] church never hesitated she rots the tech
[1:09:27] and came to John is a God who told you
[1:09:30] to leave your house told me to give you
[1:09:33] two alone you $10,000
[1:09:36] John said tour to watch is that I don't
[1:09:40] know you go ask him and John went and
[1:09:49] asked the Lord because he hasn't seen
[1:09:52] such a money before together and the
[1:09:54] Lord said to him okay you start a
[1:09:57] building business a property selling
[1:10:00] business go look for a property you sell
[1:10:03] in a urinal vetted salad and like that
[1:10:07] and this brothers started that and the
[1:10:10] breath of God began to come upon it and
[1:10:13] the breath of God began to come upon it
[1:10:16] and the orphan started expanding started
[1:10:20] expanding and it has it expanded so much
[1:10:24] until when the Prophet was telling the
[1:10:26] story of this brother is a right now
[1:10:29] John chariot as 1500 actors not a cash
[1:10:35] actors and is employing more than 15,000
[1:10:39] Mexicans to work on their farm and
[1:10:42] hardly a paid four million dollars to
[1:10:45] the cost of the gospel and is that right
[1:10:48] now right now brother John has God's
[1:10:52] home a lot of children until is
[1:10:54] beginning to has got to slow down is
[1:10:57] that as I'm talking to you now the
[1:10:59] reason John couldn't be in this mission
[1:11:01] is because the wife has just put to bed
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:08] that was a woman who was bearish and
[1:11:11] brother brand middleman he said see what
[1:11:13] 15 years see what difference 15 years a
[1:11:17] in the life of that man
[1:11:20] he said because that man switched to the
[1:11:22] Lord and is ripping bunch of alarbus so
[1:11:27] whatever you are dream for the Lord
[1:11:28] don't slack don't be discouraged I'm
[1:11:32] declaring harvest because there shall be
[1:11:35] an harvest amen
[1:11:37] nobody plant one seed and reap just one
[1:11:41] seat a first time is always an
[1:11:45] interesting time
[1:11:51] plans to be sure harvest
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:12:01] you love him tonight okay
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:07] I just thought I should sense that maybe
[1:12:12] it's going to help somebody maybe it's
[1:12:14] going to encourage somebody okay let's
[1:12:16] make that our background and look at the
[1:12:19] great husband man himself the Lord Jesus
[1:12:25] of the Gentiles
[1:12:37] maybe complexes of thinking about this
[1:12:45] pasta or dis man called Jesus but anyhow
[1:12:51] the things that we are saying was too
[1:12:54] attractive for them to ignore Jesus so
[1:13:00] they decided to take a trip anyhow
[1:13:03] whether they understood the program or
[1:13:06] not when I understood what he preached
[1:13:08] or not whether they understood his
[1:13:11] instruction or not it doesn't matter
[1:13:13] they wanted a taste and the Bible says
[1:13:21] they devised a plan to approach Jesus
[1:13:24] and they went through some of the
[1:13:27] Apostles as an excuse me sir can you
[1:13:30] oppose book an appointment and the man
[1:13:33] said to to passer Jesus who are you we
[1:13:37] are Greeks I would love to tell my
[1:13:40] fellow colleague and unrelated to
[1:13:44] another person and the two of them came
[1:13:46] and said pastor the Greeks are
[1:13:49] interested in seeing you amen now when
[1:13:54] you see the Prophet preach saga will see
[1:13:57] Jesus is not preaching just seeing him
[1:14:00] as a person
[1:14:02] they want to see the working of Jesus
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:07] that is a meaning of sass we will see
[1:14:10] Jesus and you know Jesus when asked that
[1:14:15] request is said now it's my time for
[1:14:18] purification you won't understand - it
[1:14:22] won't be glorified until he dies if the
[1:14:27] Gentiles are beginning to have an
[1:14:29] awakening that they need me they want to
[1:14:33] enjoy my walking they want to see my
[1:14:36] power they want to be a my effect then
[1:14:40] something has gotta take place now then
[1:14:46] Jesus give them a parable he said except
[1:14:51] a corn of wheat dies if we abide a law
[1:14:57] that one con will remain one con and if
[1:15:02] it says long that one can we be hedging
[1:15:05] and it should be depreciated but if that
[1:15:09] one con will produce ma is got to be
[1:15:12] ready to die so God believes in harvest
[1:15:20] heaven it's absurd as such this one con
[1:15:24] dies it will abide alone by itself the
[1:15:28] disciples may not understand what he has
[1:15:30] passed a message then gradually the one
[1:15:34] con began to talk about his death and
[1:15:37] like you add in the morning Peter will
[1:15:40] say over my dead body will you die
[1:15:44] you got a lot of zeroes people in the
[1:15:47] church it's fine it will get better with
[1:15:50] them as they keep growing in the Lord
[1:15:52] Peter taught was doing crazy fever but I
[1:15:56] didn't realize that by that it was
[1:15:58] trying to stop God's program anyhow the
[1:16:02] divine program couldn't be stopped it
[1:16:04] came to that particular day our Lord
[1:16:07] went down the reason it went down is to
[1:16:11] be able to multiply so God knew that if
[1:16:15] you plant one seed of corn you are going
[1:16:17] to get up he's a cop even though two
[1:16:21] curves and on a curb you have many seeds
[1:16:24] of car are you catchin it now I'm
[1:16:29] preaching this because this is the kind
[1:16:31] of advice
[1:16:31] God preached this is the kind of others
[1:16:35] Jesus our Lord preached this is the kind
[1:16:37] of average brother Brahm preached FS is
[1:16:40] not the rapture FS is something that
[1:16:43] would take place before the rapture it
[1:16:45] might sound strange to you but that is
[1:16:48] the truth okay let's go on alright
[1:16:54] so when he died settin knowing that if
[1:16:59] this man get off there's gonna be a
[1:17:02] problem is it
[1:17:07] I don't know when Christ was alive his
[1:17:10] life was a problem when he died it was a
[1:17:15] problem when a rose brother it was also
[1:17:20] a problem but is there a problem to you
[1:17:24] it's just aside you belong now these
[1:17:34] people watch him while alive now he has
[1:17:37] given up the ghost yielded up the ghost
[1:17:39] they confirmed it's themselves they were
[1:17:43] the one who wondered about the body to
[1:17:45] be buried and when it was buried they
[1:17:51] came back to Pilate excuse me Pilate
[1:17:55] excuses governor you see this deceiver
[1:17:58] then we are actually afraid because they
[1:18:03] know that everything he had ever spoken
[1:18:05] nothing has ever failed and while he was
[1:18:09] alive he told him I have the power to
[1:18:12] lay down my life
[1:18:15] nobody ever talked like that because
[1:18:18] nobody lived by himself
[1:18:20] nobody exist by himself there only one
[1:18:24] qualified to be hello him is the one who
[1:18:27] come in the body called Christ I have
[1:18:32] once before hey bruh he rejoiced to see
[1:18:35] my day before Abraham was I have the new
[1:18:42] everything he had spoken had come to
[1:18:44] pass and you watch the politics watch
[1:18:48] something he said that deceiver while he
[1:18:51] was alive since that it will raise on
[1:18:55] the tenth day and we know that wisdom to
[1:18:59] have an idea that it will not happen hmm
[1:19:02] but so we want you to let I am more
[1:19:07] amore and security and seal the place so
[1:19:12] that nobody will come and tell your
[1:19:13] story now these people are bad
[1:19:17] politicians and they are very wicked do
[1:19:21] you know when you tell the truth you
[1:19:23] will be consistent but because with
[1:19:27] these people we align they couldn't be
[1:19:29] consistent I will show you the align now
[1:19:31] one of the reasons they killed Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ was to say that he said if we
[1:19:38] destroy our temple and on the touch day
[1:19:41] it will Reza talked they pretended then
[1:19:45] as if they did not understand what Jesus
[1:19:48] said so this the opposition is against
[1:19:53] their better judgment
[1:19:55] then knew that wasn't what Jesus Christ
[1:19:58] said Jesus wasn't talking of destroying
[1:20:01] physica temple he was talking of the
[1:20:03] temple of himself but when it was
[1:20:07] convenient they came to use it as an
[1:20:10] exhibit in order to get him crucified
[1:20:16] then why did they change the story of
[1:20:18] the crucifixion percenter this man said
[1:20:22] on the third day we rise oh he didn't
[1:20:24] say it twice is that it at the same
[1:20:27] place that them is controlled the only
[1:20:36] thing that can make you constant is if
[1:20:38] you tell the truth so it's just that
[1:20:41] these people we are liars
[1:20:42] these people were deceived they
[1:20:45] understood better what Jesus said but
[1:20:48] because of the needs to gather false
[1:20:50] accusation against him the sanitary
[1:20:54] would destroy a temple now they are no
[1:20:56] more talking about the temple they are
[1:20:58] now talking about himself
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:08] yes brother we are sporting the devil
[1:21:11] and the governor said I don't understand
[1:21:15] you people again when this man was alive
[1:21:18] it was your problem now is dead is your
[1:21:21] headache excuse me you have the Lord you
[1:21:24] have the enforcement agenda police and
[1:21:26] everything and the soldiers go on attend
[1:21:29] to it as much as you wanted you know
[1:21:32] what was happening the devil was using
[1:21:35] those guys to disturb the arrest the
[1:21:41] ones that planted seeds to die and
[1:21:43] rotten and never bring forth life but
[1:21:47] there is nothing that can stop God's
[1:21:49] program the law of God is does the soul
[1:21:54] in tears must reap in joy nothing can
[1:22:00] stop it nothing absolutely can stop his
[1:22:05] resurrection it has done be spoken it
[1:22:09] must come to pass
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:18] so excuse me
[1:22:24] so what happened they went to the grave
[1:22:29] they put several Roman seals that is one
[1:22:33] other time let's leave that one but they
[1:22:35] put to those hills and they I had my
[1:22:37] mercenaries and soldiers yes looking guy
[1:22:40] with sophisticated weapons to do what to
[1:22:45] block the office because they know if
[1:22:53] Jesus have a rise up according to his
[1:22:56] principles of John chapter 12 there is
[1:22:59] going to be problem
[1:23:01] Satan was contending with just one man
[1:23:04] but is now have to is not going to face
[1:23:07] many members body of the same one can
[1:23:13] you catch that
[1:23:14] that is God's harvests
[1:23:22] so they put everything in there but I
[1:23:27] like it when the scripture said on the
[1:23:29] Ted T the angel of the Lord Kingdom
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:34] where were these guys they didn't sleep
[1:23:39] that we are wide awake God kept them
[1:23:43] wide awake to see everything that
[1:23:46] happened in the oven wide awake that we
[1:23:49] are shaken that we are shaken and this
[1:23:53] angel came he broke the seal and erode
[1:23:58] away the stone and is such upon it tryna
[1:24:02] challenge try me if you can we tell your
[1:24:08] weapons with all your palms we tell you
[1:24:11] artilleries try me if you can and the
[1:24:15] surgeons couldn't they couldn't do it
[1:24:18] then they can do it nothing will stop
[1:24:23] this arrest nothing will stop your body
[1:24:27] change nothing will stop your
[1:24:30] resurrection nothing will stop your
[1:24:32] abduction because it has been spoken it
[1:24:37] must come to pass having an actual pass
[1:24:40] away God's Word can never pass away
[1:24:44] there is not enough demons in hell thou
[1:24:48] canst repeat
[1:24:56] they can stop your display they can stop
[1:24:59] your demonstration we have a promise a
[1:25:02] quick short walk will take place in here
[1:25:05] we have a promise there will be another
[1:25:08] outpouring brother Bram said in our
[1:25:11] spiritual race listen to me is that the
[1:25:15] vehicle of the bride at our transit of
[1:25:19] the Antichrist in the message looking
[1:25:22] away to Jesus is that what we are doing
[1:25:25] now is to slow down and waiting for them
[1:25:28] to catch up inside when they catch up
[1:25:31] watch the tote pool then what you see
[1:25:34] temporarily manifested will come in its
[1:25:38] fullness
[1:25:39] the total is in existence right now but
[1:25:44] it will not come in a great measure
[1:25:47] until that time something will provoke
[1:25:51] it the Antichrist will provoke it and we
[1:25:55] are waiting for them nothing will stop
[1:25:57] our demonstration
[1:26:05] let me remind you your touch this is not
[1:26:09] the edge of horse
[1:26:10] so no sacrificial animal here this is
[1:26:15] the edge of eagle when the enemy comes
[1:26:18] like a float we have a promise the
[1:26:21] Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard
[1:26:25] when Eston that is risen it goes above
[1:26:28] the floor come on friends a wonderful
[1:26:34] time is ahead don't worry don't worry
[1:26:37] brother Brahm said this quiz will be
[1:26:41] here fellowship in like these will
[1:26:44] become fond memories he said is gonna
[1:26:46] put a pressure on us until we are almost
[1:26:49] pressed out he said what you've got
[1:26:52] nothing to be afraid of because at that
[1:26:55] hour oh there's gonna be a revival of
[1:27:00] the jaws that's gonna be another foreign
[1:27:03] it's a promise it will never fail only
[1:27:08] believe all things are possible
[1:27:19] this is the office we are talking about
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:25] sure the hinges sat on each and it was
[1:27:31] watching what the soldiers will do
[1:27:32] instead of the soldiers are talking they
[1:27:36] were so scared until when death
[1:27:40] environment settle down they took to
[1:27:43] their heels they run for their dear
[1:27:46] lives and I watch where did they go -
[1:27:49] they went to other people their
[1:27:51] principals who engage their services and
[1:27:54] when I got there that didn't mince words
[1:27:56] as a massage except we shall deceive our
[1:28:01] sir we saw him who did you see that's a
[1:28:06] man the man you call the deceiver
[1:28:09] we saw him you watch out everybody ought
[1:28:14] to know who our Lord he's evil Satan we
[1:28:19] testified we saw in usage Jesus yes sir
[1:28:28] it came out so what did you do what can
[1:28:32] we do the glory was too much the power
[1:28:36] was too much the presence was too great
[1:28:39] for any man to face -
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:51] yes I problem now there quickly someone
[1:28:55] becomes you it's all is it or getting a
[1:28:59] church members when they want to do bad
[1:29:00] things they don't they need only short
[1:29:05] notice you see them gather gossip as
[1:29:09] don't need long notices together but
[1:29:13] bite has done it locked it's it's so
[1:29:15] easy these guys quickly gather what must
[1:29:19] we do now watch conspiracies are started
[1:29:23] from the church against their own
[1:29:28] conscience these guys are going to
[1:29:31] bypass their conscience dangerous
[1:29:35] fellows too old unto a lie and make the
[1:29:40] a chemistry believe it is the truth
[1:29:44] bribery started from the church
[1:29:50] the piper sighs okay okay okay okay we
[1:29:54] have I don't don't say it again
[1:29:56] don't say it again don't say it again
[1:29:59] so what must we say we are going to keep
[1:30:03] we're going to organize a press
[1:30:04] conference and we are going to give you
[1:30:10] a prepared written script and you are
[1:30:14] going to read it out whether you feel it
[1:30:18] correct or not just bypass your
[1:30:22] conscience and say what we tell you and
[1:30:26] if you can accept that the deal is two
[1:30:30] million dollars yes that now you are
[1:30:34] talking you are talking organize the
[1:30:40] press conference they organize the press
[1:30:43] conference
[1:30:44] Nebraska news here and BBC all kind of
[1:30:47] ordered to give a wide international
[1:30:50] coverage
[1:30:53] and they told them you see friends we
[1:30:58] did our job but somehow along the line
[1:31:02] they know their lies won't sell and they
[1:31:04] know that it was going to embarrass the
[1:31:07] Iraqi of the harming so they told them
[1:31:10] in advance you go ahead with the press
[1:31:12] conference if the governor is annoyed
[1:31:14] will be secure emotion this is the
[1:31:17] church talking this is not business this
[1:31:20] is not politicians this is they charge
[1:31:24] come on friends charge talking and they
[1:31:29] organized a conference and they told the
[1:31:33] ally this man did not resolve it was
[1:31:36] stolen and they have done it so well
[1:31:39] that they were no Ally a reporter to
[1:31:42] interview them to interrogate them so
[1:31:45] one reporter got up to say what were you
[1:31:47] doing when it was - how can you be
[1:31:49] sleeping say we won't entertain
[1:31:51] questions because it's actually shameful
[1:31:57] for a soldier to be sleeping
[1:32:01] at such a critical time so they they had
[1:32:05] it all arranged and the Bible said the
[1:32:09] news that it was stolen started
[1:32:12] traveling father than the news that it
[1:32:16] resurrected and you say you would have
[1:32:22] expected Jesus to do something about
[1:32:24] that
[1:32:26] look at that you would have expected him
[1:32:31] to come out and organize a counter press
[1:32:33] conference some of us that is what we
[1:32:36] will do but that is not what Christ will
[1:32:40] do adoption material amen
[1:32:45] Ted something from here it was allowed
[1:32:48] the news to be going in you have nobody
[1:32:51] can blight his name and it didn't even
[1:32:54] make it easy at least appear to some few
[1:32:58] public people let them testify even if
[1:33:01] they will call it apparition if they
[1:33:03] will call it illusion let them call it
[1:33:06] what appear to somebody the Bible says
[1:33:08] Jesus never did that he appeared only to
[1:33:12] those who share connection
[1:33:17] I guess the snooze you are going around
[1:33:20] do you know what he chose to do silently
[1:33:23] it began to empower an army because now
[1:33:28] what the devil was pushing him to do
[1:33:30] will have broken the scripture the seed
[1:33:34] of corn has died
[1:33:35] it has rotten and it has come back alive
[1:33:39] it's coming back alive is to reproduce
[1:33:43] himself in plentiful so it is not longer
[1:33:47] it is no longer the Ministry of Christ
[1:33:50] to defend himself it did all that be
[1:33:54] proved is point before it dies after is
[1:33:58] dead and resurrection
[1:33:59] it is less for his body to stop giving
[1:34:03] the proof that it is not that this was
[1:34:10] why Jesus refused him it's not that
[1:34:15] empowering is before it started
[1:34:17] empowering the disciples and see what
[1:34:20] they are saying is a don't worry we
[1:34:21] shall apply them we shall apply them you
[1:34:25] catch this you catch this you catch this
[1:34:28] and it was fortifying them when they
[1:34:31] finish their fortification is that the
[1:34:33] ceiling of your fortification is the
[1:34:35] apparel you can stay there when that
[1:34:39] power comes you will be my witnesses
[1:34:41] those lies they are talking it will
[1:34:44] never take you one week to change the
[1:34:46] story
[1:34:47] I am giving you what it takes to change
[1:34:50] the story so don't mind what they are
[1:34:53] saying that ever cannot make me obey Him
[1:34:56] he wants to push me to take over your
[1:34:59] own ministry Christ is not gonna take
[1:35:02] over years he has done is it is
[1:35:05] enough for you to take it over from
[1:35:07] there this was why he refused to reply
[1:35:11] he refused to all the press conference
[1:35:18] there on the day of Pentecost the Holy
[1:35:21] Ghost fair the Holy Ghost fell with the
[1:35:25] falling of the Holy Ghost came the
[1:35:27] understanding of the wedge because by -
[1:35:29] Pizza understood what Matthew 28 was he
[1:35:33] knew it wasn't in titles it has got to
[1:35:35] be in a name so the first salmon was a
[1:35:38] salmon with revelation in the name of
[1:35:40] Jesus Christ and they keep in ansan the
[1:35:43] church and the people began to look at
[1:35:46] them very differently then one day Peter
[1:35:50] James and John the satyr walking the
[1:35:55] want to go to the temple and one man who
[1:35:58] has always been there everybody knew him
[1:36:02] the critics know him the believers know
[1:36:05] him the unbelievers know him so if
[1:36:09] something happened to him it cannot be
[1:36:11] said it's a lie because everybody knew
[1:36:14] him and this man began to look at this
[1:36:18] region to many as if to get something
[1:36:21] from them he wanted a little TT dollars
[1:36:25] to service problem temporarily but
[1:36:29] inside this earthen vessel was a deposit
[1:36:32] of permanent solution was a deposit of
[1:36:36] eternal life my goodness inside this
[1:36:40] earthen vessels is a deposit of eternal
[1:36:44] life to give life to give healing to
[1:36:48] give deliverance for even give salvation
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:58] so Peter said look on Hoss
[1:37:02] TT dollars u.s. dollars British pounds
[1:37:05] we don't have as old as you people are
[1:37:09] well-dressed into me you don't have
[1:37:12] sometimes it's like that we don't have
[1:37:16] [Applause]
[1:37:17] but such as we have this is the obvious
[1:37:23] now this is the harvest now such as we
[1:37:28] have will give unto you they did not
[1:37:32] even bring they only spoke this what as
[1:37:37] Christ's such as we have will give unto
[1:37:41] you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up
[1:37:46] and walk
[1:37:46] and the Bible signs the man the man the
[1:37:52] man is status now what began to work
[1:37:56] upon him and it began to gather strange
[1:38:00] and it's not gotten up and it begins to
[1:38:03] walk and to limp enter praise the Lord
[1:38:07] what in lipping present the Lord walking
[1:38:12] limping pressing
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:21] as such is a stitch that's what the
[1:38:25] ovens in any one has discharged
[1:38:31] no one that enhance York when the people
[1:38:35] shot these people is a little forget it
[1:38:39] this guy's a christ-like in harder watch
[1:38:43] disciplines Ian of Christ as we produce
[1:38:46] many Christ this is the harvest
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:57] oh and guess what up on top the news of
[1:39:03] this Reviva went everywhere they haven't
[1:39:08] seen anything like blush and be some
[1:39:11] guys who were critics it gots to them so
[1:39:16] we do with distance going but we supply
[1:39:20] we put so much millions for the press to
[1:39:23] suppress these news and yet this news is
[1:39:26] traveling Jesus is wiser it doesn't only
[1:39:34] talk he hawks the gospel is not just in
[1:39:39] watch there must be a demonstration oh
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:47] he doesn't only talk he hacks then they
[1:39:53] called the disciples what do we have
[1:39:55] fridge to hear that we hear it now watch
[1:39:57] in Acts chapter three said by what power
[1:40:01] and what name did you do it Peter
[1:40:06] yes an opportunity I wanted I wanted my
[1:40:10] lord to organize a press conference long
[1:40:12] time ago he didn't do it now you people
[1:40:15] have organized a press conference and I
[1:40:18] will take advantage okay
[1:40:20] all of you listen now listen now you see
[1:40:25] the same Jesus whom you crucified
[1:40:31] hallelujah you crucified Him but God
[1:40:38] blessed him it aside we saw him with
[1:40:43] touch him we felt him we impressive and
[1:40:47] we know that in resurrected not sin
[1:40:52] Jesus fetch in his name heal this man
[1:40:58] you can challenge such a press
[1:41:00] conference so Jesus was defending his
[1:41:08] integrity in his many member bodies that
[1:41:12] is the Amish
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:27] that is why brother Brown says the first
[1:41:32] office was Pentecost is a quotation
[1:41:37] ecetera is that the first of s was
[1:41:40] Pentecost if there was an harvest of
[1:41:43] Pentecost that means there was a seed
[1:41:46] suing to bring about our harvest then is
[1:41:51] that after Pentecost when she cost
[1:41:55] itself by the Apostles became another
[1:41:59] seed swing
[1:42:03] [Music]
[1:42:05] because it started the beginning of many
[1:42:09] members body we are as it was always one
[1:42:12] person it has now become the body of
[1:42:16] that one person with many members are
[1:42:19] you catching the Church of the Living
[1:42:21] God then it became the new deposits for
[1:42:28] another of s brother Brahm said this new
[1:42:33] deposit which is not the deposit this
[1:42:36] soil of the bridegroom now but of his
[1:42:39] bride was buried Magnusson canceled so
[1:42:49] the truth was held until the edges of
[1:42:52] the charge went into the dark era that's
[1:42:56] what he's saying
[1:42:57] and it looks like that is the end to
[1:43:00] each but bring the principle of John
[1:43:03] chapter 12 a game for NEC to multiply
[1:43:10] itself which the multiplication is the
[1:43:14] harvest there must be a planting first
[1:43:20] God wasn't satisfied with the number he
[1:43:23] gathered in Pentecost he wanted more
[1:43:30] pasta pizza with no one less man with
[1:43:33] one warm
[1:43:34] that's inspiration from God so you know
[1:43:40] what it is what was buried all of a
[1:43:45] sudden in luta started giving a shoot so
[1:43:51] this one is not actually dead and gone
[1:43:55] it was all God's program those thoughts
[1:43:59] are not a mighty Reeve i'ma
[1:44:01] [Applause]
[1:44:06] now look I didn't carry the entire pitch
[1:44:11] of the siege don't take it off when the
[1:44:16] seed is buried to the ground if you are
[1:44:18] taking it off you are gonna kill me
[1:44:20] completely
[1:44:21] just leave it if you have a moment it
[1:44:25] looks like nothing is happening or will
[1:44:28] ever happen for you just leave it as
[1:44:32] long as it is an original seat The Sun
[1:44:41] will be just right for it
[1:44:44] then what I will be just right for it
[1:44:48] God is never a loser is the best farmer
[1:44:53] I ever knew
[1:45:00] you know again in that dark in that
[1:45:02] period again the devil went on a rampage
[1:45:05] and he started accusing God the silence
[1:45:09] God God did not respond as usual God
[1:45:15] allow him to be making his noise then in
[1:45:19] luta he gave a shoot which is a sign
[1:45:26] that in life that was buried under a
[1:45:30] started his journey of physical
[1:45:34] manifestation now that life which was a
[1:45:40] stalk moved from the stalk into tassel
[1:45:46] amen brother Bronson Luther was like a
[1:45:50] former in then Wesley became its lottery
[1:45:56] then from that I sell it moved into the
[1:46:01] shock Tasha was Wesley now all these
[1:46:06] stages stages of the potential siege but
[1:46:12] it is not deceit yet
[1:46:19] the Prophet said if I need a hook tree
[1:46:23] and you give me a seat of oak
[1:46:27] potentially I have my hope tree now the
[1:46:32] husband man must be patient to plant a
[1:46:37] seed and to do the work of cultivation
[1:46:40] and in due season they will get the hook
[1:46:44] tree it is only impatience - we process
[1:46:50] life arise so it moves gradually the
[1:46:56] life left the stalk it came into the
[1:46:59] tussle and from the tassel it moved into
[1:47:03] the shop now the shock it's always
[1:47:08] looking like the real thing but it is
[1:47:14] not the real thing
[1:47:16] hey what the shot is necessary to
[1:47:21] certain times I'm sure you enjoy the
[1:47:24] blessings of the morning and that is why
[1:47:29] in this age God allowed this year the
[1:47:33] first move of God in loud this young age
[1:47:36] was a Pentecostal move
[1:47:40] we're bringing it home to us now this
[1:47:44] age started as a Pentecostal age that
[1:47:49] was the period of the shock love day she
[1:47:53] has got two phases for the believer
[1:47:57] underline the word for the believer for
[1:48:01] non-believer is just got one fish but
[1:48:05] for the seed of God in this hour there
[1:48:07] are two phases the Pentecostal
[1:48:10] experience is very important it is your
[1:48:13] shock experience to prepare you for the
[1:48:17] real thing that's what the Prophet stars
[1:48:23] Marissa brother Bram said for you to get
[1:48:27] the wish you must pull the shock away or
[1:48:32] that grain must abandon the shock that
[1:48:37] was what we have been told in the
[1:48:38] morning and it was simplified to even
[1:48:41] our personal lives
[1:48:43] you catch on it why must the grain leave
[1:48:48] the shock because the Sharks protection
[1:48:52] will not facilitate ripening
[1:48:58] it's a good protection to keep this
[1:49:02] grain till certain stage but in the hour
[1:49:06] of a vest for there to be harvest some
[1:49:13] timers a punch to the shop
[1:49:16] are you catchin it and this is why if
[1:49:20] you look at certain stories of
[1:49:22] redemption you will realize that the
[1:49:26] journey of redemption always starts with
[1:49:29] two categories let's go to the Bible do
[1:49:35] you know the roof was brought into the
[1:49:39] economy of redemption in Israel in the
[1:49:42] season of badly events aha the Prophet
[1:49:50] said we bring my understanding from the
[1:49:52] scripture is to do types and shadows we
[1:49:56] are not geologists so we can do
[1:49:59] tessaro's and all kind of this but we'll
[1:50:01] bring the pattern from the scriptures
[1:50:04] are you following now Ruth spoke of you
[1:50:08] and her it's a perfect time because Ruth
[1:50:13] was a Gentile who was brought to enjoy
[1:50:17] the blessings who was brought by
[1:50:19] kinsman-redeemer she into the economy
[1:50:22] and the blessings that used to be the
[1:50:24] preserve of Israel and it was important
[1:50:28] for roots to come
[1:50:30] ah the design for roots to be in the
[1:50:37] picture was necessary to give you a
[1:50:41] perfect shadow otherwise you will not be
[1:50:45] able to relate with your Redemption now
[1:50:49] roots coming into the economy of Israel
[1:50:53] wasn't an accident
[1:50:56] brother brown preach why it had to be
[1:50:58] Bethlehem and it told us in that message
[1:51:02] that before the foundation of the world
[1:51:03] God has designed and arranges program
[1:51:07] and part of that program is to include
[1:51:10] the Gentiles in the salvation plan as a
[1:51:14] matter of fact the true women that bill
[1:51:17] to the a century of Jesus were Gentile
[1:51:20] women
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:25] you're talking about rare and you talk
[1:51:28] about Ruth come on friends I feel so
[1:51:32] good I'm a 10 time
[1:51:40] and look how beautiful disease God took
[1:51:44] people who look worthless Moab was
[1:51:50] almost an abomination to Israelites you
[1:51:54] know their backgrounds they came out of
[1:51:57] instance she was living oh my
[1:52:01] and whatever rap that woman was so much
[1:52:05] in prostitution until a lot became a
[1:52:08] sunny gray up the a lot do you ever
[1:52:11] notice ernamaria a lot was a surname but
[1:52:18] Messi rewrote their lives
[1:52:23] it is not impair wheelage not in the
[1:52:27] runners or managers God as you are
[1:52:31] messing the race is not for the Swift's
[1:52:35] not a batch of artists wrong
[1:52:48] hallelujah Ruth can aim in the season of
[1:52:55] others and when she started a journey to
[1:52:59] come she didn't stutter alone she didn't
[1:53:02] start alone
[1:53:03] she started with another lady who looked
[1:53:07] like ah they were both called
[1:53:10] daughters-in-law one was Appa one was
[1:53:16] Ruth and they both decided hallelujah
[1:53:21] I'm pretty pastor they both decided to
[1:53:25] come with Nami in the season of Ava's
[1:53:31] hey I'm gonna touch someone's now for
[1:53:38] you to know that whatever is happening
[1:53:41] along the message today shouldn't
[1:53:44] discourage you or these are things that
[1:53:49] are to be if the picture will be perfect
[1:53:52] you have some people who are pretty
[1:53:55] messy for 40 years and today they are
[1:53:58] talking the same message they never
[1:54:01] typed it in 1965 they never attacked it
[1:54:05] in 1962 what they are talking it now
[1:54:08] because it is the season of the office
[1:54:12] [Applause]
[1:54:15] and the picture must become perfect
[1:54:19] I've got enough apologies for such
[1:54:22] nonsense
[1:54:23] whether I believe this I know Dutch
[1:54:25] design I don't care
[1:54:33] somebody once told me United States you
[1:54:36] say you could be shot for that as a just
[1:54:38] one bullet if God allows you while you
[1:54:42] cannot suppress me from saying the truth
[1:54:45] I am a witness of the resurrection and
[1:54:49] the power of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:54:53] must add press conference all the time
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:08] it is a season of the harvest and up as
[1:55:12] most sure hope it wasn't easy to get up
[1:55:18] out of the journey she traveled very far
[1:55:22] Alleluia until now me preach a message
[1:55:26] of hopelessness because it is all about
[1:55:32] what they can get out of it if they can
[1:55:36] no longer catch anything then nothing is
[1:55:40] longer the truth
[1:55:41] they told women not to wear trousers but
[1:55:45] the moment they denied a message their
[1:55:47] wives thought that we are in pants what
[1:55:50] has been the 'value for 40 years
[1:55:52] nonsense
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:56:02] Naaman looks at the two of them is the
[1:56:05] excuse me ladies
[1:56:07] maybe you don't understand what is
[1:56:09] happening I'm saying that I'm an old
[1:56:11] woman I'm saying that there's no more
[1:56:14] child in my womb let's even say God
[1:56:16] allowed me to have a child and then it
[1:56:19] becomes a son or two boys or twins now
[1:56:22] you people are maybe I don't know that
[1:56:24] you're twenty late twenties and before
[1:56:27] this boy can marry you you will have
[1:56:29] become 50 and you will become will you
[1:56:31] wait for them till that long opposite
[1:56:35] that makes sense that lets that made
[1:56:44] sense so many nonsenses are making sense
[1:56:47] toward you a pass of this hour today it
[1:56:52] wasn't there when when Wendy Wendy Wendy
[1:56:56] Ringo of cloud appeared that make sense
[1:56:58] he wasn't there
[1:57:00] it's not a news who was the first person
[1:57:04] who told you it wasn't there it was
[1:57:06] brother Branham because you don't read
[1:57:09] your message correctly girlie the
[1:57:11] message three kinds of believers it's a
[1:57:13] distant upon it at two days before I got
[1:57:16] there or two days after I went there it
[1:57:19] was brother Bram who said we didn't
[1:57:22] plant it in the tips from day one that
[1:57:25] was his first public commentary so it is
[1:57:28] not news for you to come and tell us
[1:57:29] that we have discovered this lie
[1:57:32] he never lies but what you cannot deny
[1:57:35] is the fact that that happened because
[1:57:37] witnesses a bunch today only prophet
[1:57:41] told to take cover why the angels came
[1:57:44] down if you think it was after it got
[1:57:48] there brother Branson it was the Angels
[1:57:50] departing after their message if you say
[1:57:54] it was before it was after it was before
[1:57:57] I got there it was the angels lowering
[1:57:59] down to give the message it already said
[1:58:02] that so you are not telling us something
[1:58:05] new
[1:58:11] but what the Hoppus of this hour it
[1:58:14] makes sense
[1:58:18] it will look so real to you but you know
[1:58:22] us certain things are written in other
[1:58:25] to Teke of APPA ah in the message of
[1:58:30] villain of god brother Brahms that we
[1:58:33] have to say things deliberately
[1:58:34] sometimes and he said it is
[1:58:38] intentionally said it will cause some to
[1:58:42] ponder it will cause some to sit down
[1:58:45] and say lord have mercy upon me it will
[1:58:48] cause him to stumble out and they will
[1:58:51] stain the compound wondering whether to
[1:58:53] come back or - square way and if you
[1:58:56] make some to go completely away but the
[1:58:59] Prophet said that is done intentionally
[1:59:01] because every seed line must be taken
[1:59:04] care of
[1:59:04] come on friends the dynamics of the true
[1:59:08] church and the first charge is in the
[1:59:10] end of one man brother Brahma the
[1:59:19] Messenger of God will speak for God to
[1:59:23] put the true church and the false charge
[1:59:26] but it is actually a messenger to the
[1:59:29] true church but since God does not have
[1:59:33] to mouth
[1:59:34] he's gonna use only one mouthpiece that
[1:59:38] one mouthpiece we bring the light for
[1:59:41] the hour and every plantation vegetation
[1:59:45] whether good or bad they need sunlight
[1:59:50] sunlight is not going to change your
[1:59:52] seat what is going to transform that
[1:59:55] seat through different stages to come to
[1:59:59] its maturity and achieve its purpose
[2:00:02] so Judas Iscariot beampath of Christ
[2:00:06] disciple was not accidental Jesus chose
[2:00:10] him listen to me he chose him and from
[2:00:16] day one he knew who he was
[2:00:20] several times
[2:00:22] II told him who he was somebody will
[2:00:25] deceive me and somebody will deny me
[2:00:28] somebody will betray me he's always here
[2:00:31] Mighty One a Mighty One when it comes to
[2:00:34] Judas it douse it in another day he said
[2:00:38] that man who is dependant with me now
[2:00:42] but do you know what it couldn't do that
[2:00:45] betrayer until his time was right then
[2:00:49] he waited for his Dynamics who gave him
[2:00:52] his inspiration the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:54] himself
[2:00:55] Jesus look at him one day and said that
[2:00:58] which thou do it too quickly
[2:01:02] it was a first charge but it was
[2:01:06] inspired by Jesus come on friends to his
[2:01:10] own work there are not too light in this
[2:01:14] hour whether they accept or deny the
[2:01:17] message of the hour is God's light for
[2:01:20] today and whatever see you ha where the
[2:01:24] tears are which you must interact with
[2:01:27] the message this is what there is no
[2:01:31] problem in the message brother branham
[2:01:34] said many will come within the range of
[2:01:37] the message the range is defense of the
[2:01:40] message in support only few people with
[2:01:43] a special hearing ability which is
[2:01:47] otherwise called revelation will come
[2:01:50] inside
[2:01:57] you love him tonight amen
[2:02:02] so Obama's always be here and Ruth will
[2:02:06] be here
[2:02:07] they were priests they were preached the
[2:02:10] same message nama didn't isolate Ruth to
[2:02:15] preach one message and isolated Appa
[2:02:18] just as God never isolated Cain and Abel
[2:02:22] all the seed line started from Janice's
[2:02:25] brother Brahma the plenty was from
[2:02:27] Genesis and throughout the ages we have
[2:02:31] seen the seed line that we come to final
[2:02:34] others in this last hour
[2:02:36] Jesus God told Cain and Abel offer me
[2:02:40] something cocaine it was fruit he never
[2:02:45] brought something bad it brought the
[2:02:48] best what Aladin revelation of the blood
[2:02:51] to FL it was the blood that is what we

[2:19:06] season of the Havas now let me close
[2:19:14] with this Robitaille
[2:19:22] the 12 spies in the first Exodus a man
[2:19:28] realized when the TEDx arose when the
[2:19:32] TEDx Allah the first Exodus the second
[2:19:37] Exodus and this is the third one I must
[2:19:40] not fail to say this so bear with me all
[2:19:44] right
[2:19:44] in the first Exodus God was taking a
[2:19:47] nation out of a nation the second was
[2:19:51] taking a charge out of religion and this
[2:19:55] last one is taking the bride out of the
[2:19:57] church is taking the bride out of the
[2:20:02] shock because they with cannot mature in
[2:20:09] the Pentecostal age of love this year
[2:20:14] okay this then these twelve spies I'm
[2:20:21] gonna close on this and I would trust
[2:20:25] the Lord to walk in the spirit through
[2:20:27] the rest of the men of God
[2:20:29] this 12 spies they were sent out for
[2:20:33] spying in a vest season this other
[2:20:40] season is something you were really
[2:20:41] inspired me
[2:20:46] for root it was ballet events this one
[2:20:50] it was the arrest of grips yeah
[2:20:53] and as you can watch again the two lines
[2:20:57] we are obviously by the time they were
[2:21:02] coming back ten we on one side which it
[2:21:08] will report so much it will report along
[2:21:11] the message to them but that's fine the
[2:21:15] shadow says it the reality was showing
[2:21:20] but no matter how bad it is there will
[2:21:24] be the two again who will say we are
[2:21:29] modern able not just that we can make it
[2:21:32] we are mortal
[2:21:35] they will never be negative they will
[2:21:39] remain positive the Giants don't matter
[2:21:43] collapses the a bread for us I wish I
[2:21:47] eat them
[2:21:48] [Applause]
[2:21:52] the challenges don't matter they are
[2:21:56] bred for us
[2:21:57] and we shall hit them this quiz will not
[2:22:00] matter it is bread for us because we
[2:22:04] know that ten elders are warming up in
[2:22:07] the Pentecostal age of the church to
[2:22:10] unleash terror to this bright economy
[2:22:12] but we are waiting for them they are
[2:22:16] bred for us and we shall eat them for
[2:22:22] watch this watch this
[2:22:25] when they came back the gospel of we
[2:22:29] cannot make it made more sense to
[2:22:35] majority much more than the minority
[2:22:42] think about our forty minutes
[2:22:45] men die but the spirits that propel them
[2:22:48] don't die this spirit is still with us
[2:22:52] today that is why you are seen so many
[2:22:55] fallen away after all Jesus and Daddy of
[2:22:59] the Lord shall not come true Peter on CD
[2:23:02] as a falling away first it runs through
[2:23:05] the time people will become something
[2:23:09] else even our Lord said accepted Debbie
[2:23:12] shortened no flesh shall be saved
[2:23:18] but yes we are winding it down when they
[2:23:22] we are preaching the gospel the older
[2:23:26] people felt the new better said preach
[2:23:28] fun the younger people I want to be a
[2:23:31] young fellow right now this is not our
[2:23:35] kind of gospel then when Joshua and
[2:23:38] Caleb took over and say man I'm brother
[2:23:41] you have only had one side please listen
[2:23:43] to the other side but you know how much
[2:23:46] an influence that gospel of we cannot
[2:23:48] make hat in the life of this people but
[2:23:52] Isaac
[2:23:52] it was so impacting it made so much
[2:23:56] sense until these folks we're willing to
[2:23:59] travel back two years into Egypt and
[2:24:04] they started looking for instead
[2:24:06] of going two weeks forward into opinon
[2:24:11] you go look at the map brother brems and
[2:24:14] it's five days from Kadesh into Canaan
[2:24:16] let's put plus or minus let's make it
[2:24:18] robust to its maximum
[2:24:21] people we're willing to good two years
[2:24:24] backward instead of two weeks forward in
[2:24:29] the season of the harvest because of a
[2:24:34] strange goes well think about your life
[2:24:38] tonight said let us make captain who is
[2:24:43] going to be our captain
[2:24:44] they started shopping for captain does
[2:24:46] not misfortune first of all let us make
[2:24:49] up using a lot of people have evil in
[2:24:51] their heart they are only looking for
[2:24:53] out for a model said let us make captain
[2:24:57] who we take us back to Egypt and just
[2:25:01] one collapse and Lord this can be you
[2:25:04] have only heard one side have you
[2:25:06] forgotten the power of God in Egypt have
[2:25:09] you forgotten the power of God in the
[2:25:11] Red Sea have you forgotten I will wear
[2:25:14] hungry and he gave us mana we are

[2:25:25] forgotten all those things never mix
[2:25:29] with faith India
[2:25:33] [Music]
[2:25:37] when Josh run killebrew's up to 70
[2:25:40] situation they were so influenced by the
[2:25:42] gospel of we cannot make it until they
[2:25:44] pick up stones and we're ready to kill
[2:25:47] Joshua and Caleb and the glory of God
[2:25:50] descended friends at that moment it was
[2:25:53] too late
[2:25:55] one of these days is gonna be too late
[2:25:58] brother Brahm said the Spirit of the
[2:26:00] Lord would be withdrawn he that is only
[2:26:03] will be holy still
[2:26:04] he that is filthy will be filled this
[2:26:06] year he told us of a time that church
[2:26:08] will be here for a while even it's not
[2:26:11] to do what to be a testimony he said if
[2:26:15] bread Falls is a middle deceive a
[2:26:17] testimony Ministry of testimony like
[2:26:20] love art like this one heart if so be
[2:26:23] their image themselves at that time
[2:26:26] preacher won't save nobody the silent
[2:26:29] act was the final phase of the judgment
[2:26:33] of the people God shots the AK but Ren
[2:26:37] did not fall immediately for the next 10
[2:26:40] to 40 days the ik was there Britain to
[2:26:44] souls that are eternally lost souls who
[2:26:48] are imprisoned think on your ways when
[2:26:54] the glory of God descended God said
[2:26:56] everybody started trying to behavior
[2:26:59] said it's too late as you have spoken in
[2:27:02] my ears
[2:27:03] so will I do to you all of you from
[2:27:06] above 20 you said you cannot make it you
[2:27:09] will never make it because I'm the eye
[2:27:11] piece of your confession
[2:27:15] the I press will not bring your
[2:27:17] sacrifice you will bring their sacrifice
[2:27:20] my brother it is whatever you bring that
[2:27:22] it will offer your behalf so what do you
[2:27:25] bring tonight if you bring I can make it
[2:27:28] you we offer for you you can make it if
[2:27:31] you say I can I will I do believe that
[2:27:33] is what is going to declare your behalf
[2:27:35] [Applause]
[2:27:38] is about how all those twenty below
[2:27:42] who says they will make it then we enter
[2:27:45] the land that you are despised and
[2:27:48] forgot to achieve that that's journey
[2:27:51] from that moment became a wandering and
[2:27:56] brother Brahm told the people sorry God
[2:27:59] told Israel is that you people will know
[2:28:02] the breach of my promise the breach of
[2:28:06] his promise is not the breaking of his
[2:28:08] promise listen God cannot break his
[2:28:12] promise but the bridge means D taken
[2:28:15] away of the promise out of the reach of
[2:28:17] the unbelievers so that only the
[2:28:20] believer can enjoy so God created a
[2:28:24] bridge of time additional 38 years
[2:28:27] forward for all the people who said they
[2:28:31] cannot make it to die
[2:28:33] read your Bible the Bible and the
[2:28:36] journey never resumed
[2:28:40] until all of them we have wiped out so
[2:28:43] much so that only those who said they
[2:28:45] can and turn into the land of promise
[2:28:49] for 38 years that we such their journey
[2:28:52] from Trinidad going to to Baku after
[2:28:55] three hours that we find himself in
[2:28:57] Chicanos or Felicity they are catching
[2:29:00] nowhere until all those people died it
[2:29:04] was a breech of time this is the reason
[2:29:08] brother Brown preached the message when
[2:29:11] it was taught in the cell phone sales
[2:29:12] the fasoli priests got eaten and
[2:29:16] revealed ins then they followed it with
[2:29:19] the bridge between the second church
[2:29:22] edges and the opening of the seven seals
[2:29:26] in other words will run to the edges of
[2:29:30] the shock the climax of the seven church
[2:29:32] age of loved Asia was Pentecostal amen
[2:29:36] but Pentecostal refused to continue when
[2:29:40] the full word of God was brought into
[2:29:43] manifestation then we are like open like
[2:29:46] the ten elders they rejected and the
[2:29:49] moment when the consolidation rejected
[2:29:52] afford it lost every article to provide
[2:29:56] Redemption this was why God cannot
[2:30:00] retain his seat in there it came to the
[2:30:03] gate of loud this year is that the old I
[2:30:06] stand at the door what he shall have
[2:30:09] been the landlord inside why was he
[2:30:12] standing outside because when it was
[2:30:14] fully presented it was pushed out the
[2:30:17] edge before allowed this year Wesley an
[2:30:19] age was the age of open door and just
[2:30:23] one more age I became a closed door not
[2:30:26] to see not to unrighteousness but to the
[2:30:28] lodges ascribes the closet up to life
[2:30:32] and loud as you died
[2:30:34] this is why 1965 brother bran pronounced
[2:30:37] love this year dead in 1963 impacted
[2:30:41] loud this year in that instance before
[2:30:43] it declared them past the redemption
[2:30:45] recognizing your beyond its message in
[2:30:48] 1965 it pronounced them dead for for
[2:30:51] since 65 till now you have been seen
[2:30:54] dead form of loud this year and that is
[2:30:56] why it's not getting better with the
[2:30:58] pentacle such things are returning and
[2:31:00] what they lost through the decades of
[2:31:02] that simply snow you are there to call
[2:31:06] you out where did you call you into we
[2:31:09] are still in the age of love this year
[2:31:11] but we are not governed by the condition
[2:31:13] of love this year this is our harvest
[2:31:15] brother Bram said the which cannot match
[2:31:18] war inside the shock it's God who come
[2:31:21] out and this is why we came out into an
[2:31:24] economy within laudation age which the
[2:31:27] professions have caught for us the
[2:31:29] bright age and the bright edge give us a
[2:31:34] better thinking he gave us better songs
[2:31:37] he gave us better perspective to the
[2:31:41] word of the Lord and India we are laying
[2:31:43] under the ensuing of God and we are
[2:31:45] wrapping gradually in fact by spiritual
[2:31:51] food in due season that the nomina Walsh
