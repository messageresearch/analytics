of the wave may you bless the reading of the word and may you minister to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says Amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise this morning even let go and let go this one let go [Music] they're born here's what for your truck we'll manage [Music] poor Helen I greet you this morning and the person name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles with it turn with me the one portion of scripture reading from the book of Romans chapter 8 thank you musicians thank you for that Anthony Romans eat and reading from verse 28 rumors eat and was trendy and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then sated these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen many many many many men it is good to be in a house of the Lord this morning it's good to be in the presence of the Lord this morning and I'm at a great expectation for God to do a book we could even ask or even think because it's his word it's his people and it's his church it's his body it's his kingdom he is the boss he is in charge he's he's the one responsible he's the one moving things around he's the one shifting things around for his purpose to be accomplished she's the one moving things into position when you don't understand why you're being moved he's the one doing the movement put the things in place for his coming he's good evenings in place for his work to be made manifest and when he has put word out he will do everything to make sure that wood comes to pass so there's no reason to be worried this morning there's no reason to be depressed this morning we only have a reason to smile this morning we only have a reason to be happy this morning we only have a reason to be excited this morning because he foreknew you and because he foreknew you and because he foreknew me he could call you and he could call me and because he called us already justified Oh as if we never did it in the first place book when he looked up your story this morning there's nothing negative about you there's there's nothing anybody could say about you he's not interested in hearing what the devil has to say about you because he already for knew you he knew what happened to you before the devil to bring the report because he foreknew you and because people knew you he could call you and because they come he can they come out from the Baptist Church come up from the message church come on from the Methodist Church yes I said come up from the message come on a church into a body into my party enter his body he is the one who is doing the calling he is not calling a group he is not calling a church he's are calling a method He is calling individuals who will respond to that call can the church famous oh you may be seated I'm just testing the temperature in the house this morning I'm under great expectation I told but over in the office we already in the convention this is this is the beginning round of convention so the devil is already bad we already stirring things up what's happening the weather patterns it's not the meteorologist who reporting on the weather telling you what to do is because of the bride the weather is responding to our action because my Bible tells me the whole creation is groaning and travailing the whole world he is moving the trees are moving the animals are moving because some sons of korah coming into position and when these sons come as a position there has to be a son that these functions week two there has to be a storm that these funds should speak to it has to be a blood that these songs could speak to that has to be crippled that these tonsils picture there must be blind eyes that these songs could speak to there must be back cider that these tongues could speak to and yet thought not also there will be some sickness that some daughters of it will speak to God will raise up sons and daughters in this last age when all hell is on the earth all heaven will be on the earth also build inner people it seal in a bribe nail in an elective and the church payment has don't have an act allow in here this morning hey man you may be seated so I want to let go on it while I'll let the thing that's on let go and let God have his way because he is the director of the symphony he is the director of York Estrin we could have our own thoughts or own ideas our own feelings own emotions our own perspectives but all of that has to die to what he wants to achieve and what he wants to accomplish and I was so blessed last week with the message the key message to point to the convention that perova speech appreciate a pastor he is a holy convocation to key into the meeting and after today's service there's just the service of Thursday and next Sunday and we are into the convention and among the great expectation and biroba didn't know what was in my heart to speak but he said something powerful last week that that holy convocation the calls that our holy convocation is not just a call it's a it's a summons and in the legal sense of summons means you don't have an option means you have to responded Lazarus didn't have an option he was dead and he had to respond when Jesus a Lazarus come forth even his sadness couldn't stop the summons [Applause] and if God has to allow the situation in your life that your deadness would exist that when the summons come Lazarus come forth there's no room to complain there's no room to answer back there's no room even at home there's no room even how shall this be when that word came Lazarus come forth Lazarus started moving because it was a power that was activated when that voice was spoken you may be seated so I have a simple message this morning and really in my heart it is not so much in my heart of preaching message I really wanted a really kind of conversation with the church because as because our last week service there's a lot of stuff that gold in the preparation or preparing for anything and it is important as you prepare for anything be it your job is whatever you're doing and in our specific it is the convention that we don't miss the most important preparation that is required for the greatest blessing that we are supposed to get so I took for a title this morning responding to the call and as a subject the approach to God and as an inspiration God demands respects I'll see it again responding to the call as a subject the approach to God and as an inspiration God demands respects because the call goes out and there's an opportunity to respond to the call and many people they respond to the calls of different invitation the reason they respond to the call to be in surgery respond but but if you respond and your approach is not right and God cannot bless you and if you don't have the right amount of respect and the right approach to God there is no blessing to come so I want to start and we're going to share something so let's just let go this morning and let go so the world is preparing for funeral service isn't that right the world is preparing for the end of all things but there are some people I believe who are preparing for resurrection they're preparing for rapture they're preparing for the wedding support preparing for conventions and special meetings there are people are preparing because Jesus is coming for his bride and by feet this morning I'm declaring that the final call is on and there will be some people who are responded to this final call they will they will not let their jobs keep them from this call it was they were not met worldly desires keep them from this call if you will not let the pain that you're going to keep it from the call because they understand that responding to the call will be the solution to their sickness responding to the call will be the financial breakthrough they're looking for responding to the call will be the deliverance from the sin that night that they may be going through that responding to the call will be deliverance for their children responding to the call will be a spiritual breakthrough after me and my house we will serve the Lord so I'm on the expectation to believe us to respond to the call not the cause come to church but the cause in a resurrection the cause of the holy ghost calls it a wedding support the cause of the jubilee of the seven seals can the church same end so we have a purpose this morning we have a destination this morning our preparation for the convention is because God has made a promise it is because of his promise we can get ready it is because there's a prophecy hanging over us we could get ready without a promise without a prophecy all our labor is in vain all our effort is in Vienna all our work is in vain and God has never made a prophecy yet that has not come to pass god I've never made a promise yet that has not come to pass or if he promised a revival it's got to come to pass in fact with a Branham says if God promised a revival let's make ready fast and we have the climate for this island we have the climate for this children you have the climate for your house look you must claim it for your life yes you can have a personal revival you have to have your revival to tea forget about who's next to you the tea should be your revival the revival is supposed to be in you the ministers that are common I'm not bringing the revival because we're the random pop up the preacher could never bring the revival the revival has to come from the people I want to see something the video this morning who will respond to the call it's the old fashioned called if the Holy Ghost cause it's the drop everything and come call and the church payment [Applause] everybody with me this morning now God cannot you see whenever the prophet but the word cannot you know we describe God an infinite all-powerful but when you go deep into the scripture with a kindly there are limitations to God because they are certainly that God cannot do he is all-powerful but God also has his own limitations because God cannot like God cannot make a mistake he cannot speak and his words don't come to earth he is all-powerful but even God has his limits somebody help me somebody help in do we have Christians in the house this morning so when God made your family is coming he cannot tell it's got to happen and when God promised up seven thundering rival and Trinity it's got to happen it's got to happen it's got to happen and my hallelujah oh you may be seated to listen to the prophets God cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision every decision he makes his public so when God put your name in the book and he foreknew you and he called you and it's dividing glorify you what the date and time you will get the Holy Ghost yes not that the decision oh just wait for it just wait for it it's gonna happen touch your neighbor and tell them I'm gonna be filled touch your other neighbor and say you are looking at the revival [Music] and just to confuse the devil tell your neighbor I am the revival [Applause] somebody semen somebody's Damon somebody's so hallelujah you may be seated the devil is afraid of when you speak up you notice a every time the devil open is multiplying every time you open your mouth you have power to change your word that's why the Bible says let the weak say let the port hey and when you speak it Lord begin to change the economy begins to change the stock market have to change why because it's power locked up inside of you and the church ceiling and the Bible said I am the Lord and I change not so if you speaking in the positivity what you want to happen what will change in your house when you begin to see my son he's coming back and you could smile with your sean's and the confidence it doesn't matter what he's doing right now to be he is coming back my daughter is coming back man my eyesight is coming back my blood pressure is getting back to normal my sugar level is yes I brought in my body got to go because it was not so from the beginning when God created me he made me perfect ah hey why have any Christians in the house it's gone you may be seated that's power in your speech that's power in your recipients power with how you say what you say you may be seated so don't tell the doctor my bakhtin and north of your is the devil's battery in ten o'clock for him it's my I'd ripeness acronym is love you are writing the devil's and right is going back to him because this body is predestinated to be changed from what house say mortality you may be seated in the house this morning with a random said how can you have seen for the rapture if you don't have people divine healing it means divine healing will become ordinary to the elect lady it will become normal to us to have somebody after testimony oh he's good in here this morning it feels good how did they feel in the front how does it feel in the back I love the ceiling the technicians good you want no room for the devil he can't hide anywhere we want to squeeze them out that's the kind of trip you want to have penetrates amen so God cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because the third decision is perfect he never has to change that powerful never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever God says with the venom sending a message modern events I made clear by prophecy it has always been God's Way the let his people know what's going to happen by the power before he doesn't let everybody know but God let his people know what's going to happen before it happens he lets a predestinated people a call our people our chosen people God's people are never surprised that's what America you'll hear walls and ruins of walls where the end is not yet don't get moved by that don't be surprised with that we got a rain can fall in the days of Noah corner to let Noah what was going on nor was the surprise no one knew how the story was going to end before restoring no one knew the rain is going to come before the turnip is over even in bondage this knew that with a mighty hand they were going to be delivered but some days in your trial you could forget the promise you can forget the prophecy under stress and the pains of life and the struggles of life you can forget what God said about you so that's why but the Baron said that when the enemy comes a letter for the Spirit will raise a pendant by taking the same word that was spoken in the fifties talking in the 60s the same word from Malachi for that you observe all these years and make it more positive make it real to you I think you're hearing for the first time it becomes TSD it becomes tangible that you're going to have a revival that you're going to have a breakthrough that you're going to get the Holy Ghost you may be seated I want you to understand that for the tune of Israel for example after years are being beaten by the taskmaster please trust me believers law school they lost hope because the grandfather told him about this revival this deliverer the grandfather went on the father tell them about it and he went on until 400 years in bondage that generation say it no longer see anything come in I take them children you cannot fit to know but I don't know if it won't happen until Moses came in town we never arrived in town I mean what that love about God going to make anything easy because it's not his way as I shared with them in Nigeria the Bible said Jesus learned obedience by the thing that he suffered the Bible doesn't tell us what he suffered but he suffered enough to become obedient let me do that again there is no description with the candy of what Jesus suffered but whenever he suffered was enough to make Jesus obedience so the Prophet are in this way you could come the easy way or you could come the hard way but because it's a summons for the Benjamin there is no choice you have to come so if I have two choices learning of the easy way or the hard way Lord let me get it easier way but some through the waters sound through them come true great trial but all through the blood so the current Church it's going to be alright tip storm this too will pass this trial will have that seen in your body will pass the financial hardship will pass the test path because testing on the beginning and can see has an ending in at the beginning and pain as an ending army at the beginning and heart we have an ending for you you will before the beginning so you can withstand the pressure of time and the limitations of time because you are great opportunities you can withstand anything oh my god [Applause] you may be seated what the teller doesn't understand friends is you are older than you look [Music] before the devil one you will happy this morning before the Sun was put into space you existed in the fat part of God mind you are older and you look your age is all of your father [Applause] so let me ask you this you ever did it what new devil what new demon what new spirit the Challenger also like mine because before it was a muna wasn't ah I was an accident Sodom in his very DNA he released me before he released the Sun and the moon [Applause] you may be seated that's why the devil is so afraid of you coming to a full realization partial realization is ok you know but full realization is troubling to the devil because when you come to a full realization of who you are who God is who the devil is then it gives you confidence it gives you authority to speak a certain way my wing could be broken but it doesn't change the fact that I'm an eagle and you guys are the only animal that exists that the renewed es strength when it gets crusty and it gets blurry and you can't see your way because they've been coming for so long you couldn't beat your head against a rock he can head against a rock and the skin is beginning to fall off and you renew your strength I de Gotha a my treason to anybody this morning [Applause] you may be seated so before the rain is falling the days of Noah God had to let no one know what was going to happen or was not surprised Noah knew how the story was going to end and today we know how our story is going to end and the devil is the one going to be in for the surprise because part of his ending is hidden under the Seventh Seal and as we know the seven CEOs fear in silence every other seal there was some symbol expressed that the devil to try to has been abandoned said impersonate but the seventh CD could not impersonate has no pious sister even in pacifically he doesn't know what the original looks like to come up with a counterfeit but the original blueprint from under the Seventh Seal God hid it didn't write it because he waited for this day and this age was songs to come into position because only mature sons could eat this food from under the seventh seal it couldn't be released a day or time earlier than it should be released within the day and time when there was sons mature enough to handle it there'll be a power connected to the third pole that would bring all the weaker ones up those that are we can see there's power under that seventh seal four units there's food under there even when you're untended listen there are many things I don't understand ab c--'s it cakes that are so good I don't want to tell how to make it but the kick is good all ice it was heated you know and you hidden manna under the 7cu I don't need to know how it was mrs. Adams even or eating good it's tasting good its nutrients with a journey that's why the properties you don't need to know the mechanics you need to know the dynamics you need to be so surrendered to God and respond to this call with the right attitude and the right approach because somewhere along the journey people have missed at the right mental attitude towards every divine promise of God is what it takes to bring it to pass it leaves the right attitude above attendance a service it plays the right attitude towards even interaction with individuals there's something about a right attitude and this wrong attitude and as we prepare for this convention my burden in my heart but you see you have the right attitude and you can only have the right attitude towards something if you understand the importance of that something and when you truly understand the importance of something is ready to truly give that something the respect that it deserves that's why the propagating we all God respects and but the Branham actually said how you respect God is how you also respect the servants you respect for one another because God demands respect so as a church as the people in the videos getting ready to respond to this call the right wing because many people came into the message and God's prophet would say that he was something go to the mountains because he saw what people really will under the 16 elements what they were thinking what they were feeling their emotions and behind the god bless you good to see you what their heart is seeing is completely different it's as if they're speaking in tongues speaking of completely different language and the Prophet have to see all of that and still treat each one look how Jesus treated Judas you can even tell you say whatever you do do quickly the broader story was going at more food and jesus knew what he was going to do how we also be more like Jesus friends God isn't coming to a group he's not coming to a convention he's coming to individuals that I responded to his call that have nothing to do with anybody else has does newt your husband your wife your neighbor your son teaches you cancer it has to do with you recognizing who you are and what is required for this the chemistry of semen so the devil friends only has a short time to try to stop you to try to stop you but it is impossible to stop you because it is going to be a resurrection is going to be a rapture there is going to be a wedding supper you are going to receive the Holy Ghost you are going to be adopted you are going to be perfect you will have power to speak for your children you are power to speak for your house if you to create that power will be there but the random taught us when that time comes you won't even have to say in Jesus name but you will speak because I boys will be in you the power I was in Christ will be in you can the church say Amen listen to the Prophet and a message of blessing probably I love this because the demands and what we need today is not social regeneration it's not intellectual talks what we need to be is an all fashion God sent blood infusion from heaven the corn plasters won't do no good we are anemia we need a blood transfusion we need to come back to the old fashioned gospel that calls out repentance before God I'm not a dry eye hand shook profession but a godsend Holy Ghost revival with the possession of the cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ into every human heart we need a revival to start in the children and sweep the nation across we're dive will perish we are gone without that type of revival all can the church same and I want to read it one more time because this is what we needed so what I'm looking for I don't know about you but it's what I'm looking for what we need I will do what I need to do is not social regeneration this is a purpose word it's not going to let your talks a little explanation needle eyes what we need to do is that all flashin blood transfusion from heaven for the brand if you take a life of junk dealers and put it into somebody they will act like John Dillinger anybody know the code so if you take the blood of Jesus and you take Isaac blood out and give me a blood transfusion because the life is in the blood that's what the devil didn't understand there was life in the Plus but their parents another chemistry but this God is different when this clerk comes in to you it changes your molecules it changes your ass on this changes your nature that's the blood I'm talking about what we need is a blood transfusion is anybody in the house this morning that needs a blood transfusion all mass unholy loads of passion cleanses all passion power god help us this morning you may be seated I'm friends that blood cannot be in you and your body could be sick no no no no no no no no because that what has power yes one drop of that blood has power that kind sin and sickness take away in we need a blood transfusion a blood transfusion will take away that right yes yes yes a blood transfusion take away lost them that's what the Holy Ghost is given for is the same thing we are talking about that's what the holy convocation is that's what plasticity means it's a blood transfusion it's a holy God himself taking his place not just in your soul but in every fiber every cell of your body or your feet won't go away shouldn't go your eyes wouldn't go any sudden go your hands won't go where a sudden go because it's all over you it's not just a temporary experience but it's a change of nature it's a change of air atop it's a change of behavior it's a change of conduct oh god help us this morning god help us this morning what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus there are people in the message that have not met the flood of season they're people in church this morning who don't know their power in the blood of Jesus or there's still power there's wonder-working power yes power the devil is afraid of this blood of but when I see the Blood I pass over you the blood is our way of escape that's power in the blood of Jesus this morning we are me Mia our blood is weak the weakness in our blood is what keeps us from our full potential the weakness in our blood that's breaking connection that Adam had that's what a blood transfusion it's what those things out it reestablishes our connection with deity it's because publishers are connected with our original creation it established the connection with your theophany because there's a sin barrier that's presenting perfect communication but when that blood transfusion takes place now you can walk in the presence of God because sin can enter into that throne room no God help was a spawning in that throne of God is holy he is holy he is holy hallelujah he is holy he is righteous he is God all by himself and your best effort can put you in his presence your best efforts cannot meet what the standard is but get that blood transfusion then you can look at you and say yes you are my son you are mature you have coming to your book and this one Candace you hmm let me nail this down that's what we need today is that social regeneration it's not intellectual talks it's not disgusting quotes back and forth no what we need is an old-fashioned God's then blood transfusion from heaven the corn plasters won't do no good you know what the point class the corn party is talking about is trying to cover up your problem you cannot plaster here you pop plaster here you have this problem for that plaster here and in the windows plasters don't solve the root cause of the problem look at it said to somebody you could go to the mountain and meditate for 20 years look at the stone on a tree for 20 years put you back in the civilization you still have to deal with the lust of the eyes you love to the flesh the pride of life because staring at a tree or a stone or whatever it is doesn't take away that nature that's verse that in your soul God is the one who put that there because the Sun is designed to help you let's understand this when your body needs water that is to save your life how would you know you are dehydrated unless you feel thirsty that first exists to save your life it's because when your body is dehydrated it sends a signal to your bridge ba and the water and then that person's activity I need what you could drink juice and the breathing ethylene water that tells it to protect you but like many of us when you need water you drink intrusion against something so much sugar but isn't any water and God places earth in your soul for the Holy Ghost itself people turn a filler we're committed sure champion religious and peace but that's not the whole egos just it's not the Holy Ghost be in spiritual is not the Holy Ghost being in the messages of the Holy Ghost axis in your soul into the Holy Ghost which is God's own life to be inside of you and the church team Oh hallelujah let me move along I've quite a few things here but you're gonna let go this morning and let God have his way as we get ready to respond to the call with the right attitude now let me skip this year from a message the approach to God but the random said God has a way of approach you know if you're going to visit a king there's a way you approach a king some time ago if we have an answer and we said that when the King sat on the throne if anybody approached without being cause the king had to extend his scepter if he did not you were killed so there's a way of a approach but the round set is a way to approach all things there's a way it's approach God and if we don't know the approach to God will never listen to the Prophet now this is not church pastor messages listeners there is a way to approach all things and there's a way to approach God there are people in church I know I was into my wife they want him Prince the pastor they will bypass deacons elders together here in with the pastor because it wanted any pastors good books that's human behavior but listen what a prophetess or but it's not about personal this is there's a way to approach God ilysm if we don't know the approach to God we'll never be able to get an audience with God now what's the sense of coming to service being in a message and you never get an audience with God because I surely can solve your problems the pastor cannot solve your problems only God could solve your problems our responsibility is to make sure you understand you have to have the right approach so good and when you break God's rules and you do not direct approach then all of your blessings are cut off some of you will not be financially blessed because you are operating under a different law what works for the world cannot work for you because you are a different covenant so what they can get away with you cannot because you are under a different law and God has a different expectation of you anybody in the house this morning listen to the prophets in our course you just don't walk up and the judgment in Spanish he hey judge I want to talk to you a little bit somebody would throw you out of the courtroom lock you up for this orderly conduct that's the profit see there's a way you have to approach the judge and we must find the way of approach to the great divine judge God Himself now listen to the prophets understand why it's important because a lot of people who claim a lot of things and it's not a problem to claim in the prophetic but when you claim as if it's evident in the reality it actually is a word that is called illusion disillusion understand the difference renders one in same interpreting I am going to be an adopted son I'm going to be a manifested son that's my promise that's my inheritance I'm speaking it I'm coming that's your right to do so but you have to know when you make a claim I am something and you know that they are skeletons in your closet that's given a different story when you go into the presence of Almighty God he sees all things north all things and you need to be honest when you come to God and that's why I say all the time you don't come to church with the pretense if you know you need to be at the altar and as a nautical you should be running so fast the Deacons will be wondering where you're really going because you know you need help because in our human condition we have our of these we have our down days we have our days when we on top the mountain where these young in the valley God doesn't impress when you put it on your best face or your best message feet so your best Church face what God wants to see is your your best your honors DP approach to God because that approach to God now means you're coming humble you come and meet you being sincere it be honest the Lord I need help when you have tried all of your ways and you're ready to give up and let go and let God have his way am i reaching anybody because in my heart God knows that in the services that are coming up I want you to get the full benefit of the word that will be spoken upon your life that you can go into action I believe that in this convention we will see the sick healed I believe in this convention that the young people who will be delivered from all kinds of manner of conditions I believe that the young people filled with a baptism of the Holy Ghost but we must have the right attitude we must have the right approach we must have respect for God but the venom sin now when man sinned back in the beginning in the Garden of Eden he separated himself and severed himself from all approach to God so the sin that hidden is what brought that connection and destroyed that natural approach that Adam would have had to commune with God and Goro's come to becoming the cool of the evening to fellowship with adam no adam has to find a way and over the power phrase but brother branham said me see if i can find it quickly skip down here the venom says a lot in this message and I encourage you to read it but I said so just polishing and joining children and reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of books on orders and so forth doesn't mean that you're convicted because you have an intellectual mind that makes you have a mental conception that there's a god somewhere he said still you're not a Christian yet until actually you become personal in contact with Christ and that contact with Christ is dependent on your approach that chain is your heart and meet you then you become God's child and all things is passed away and all things become new again and but Abraham said it's not God it's unmanned ever Colin Gordon oh no today is the same thing today that man cannot come to Christ except God calls em first see his making if you ever have any nature any thought of anything listen carefully young people if you ever had any nature any thoughts of anything of coming to God God is dealing with you because that desire to even come here God has to put it this so the fact that you are in the house of God this morning it means God is dealing with you and if God is dealing with you this morning how far will you respond to that call because jesus said no man could come to the Father or can come to me except through crisis that right the Holy Spirit has to call us first or we'll never think nothing of it it will just be no the way that God made for Adam to approach now watch Adam made himself an approach and this is what I want to touch on briefly here you see now I've got to go out and meet good so this is what Adam thought so he made himself an apron or fig leaves that cover up Hashim because he know he couldn't go to go under the condition he was in and we found out I'm a better Branson he forgot God refused that approach so I want to say this morning friends you cannot come up with your own approach so go to Gordon a copy but among that have his approach but a George have his approach but a general have his approach with a Raymond of his approach there has to be one approach to boy so he made himself an apron of fig leaves the cover of his team and he founded a chord refuse that approach and today listen to the Prophet smooth my spot today if man thinks no I'll help mrs. Jones over here she's a widow woman she needs some coal I'll give it a red cross or some charity other my abundance our joint church that you are making yourself an approach that God will refuse there's only one approach now God refused Adams approach and then God went and made an approach for Adam he made an approach to himself and by doing that he slid some sheep or something and give them some skins and should a blood brought the first approach to the world to call person for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins that's right only lud can meet the week I'm God providing an approach therefore Adam in the Garden of Eden that's true the shedding of the blood of the innocents appropriate approach to him and Adam could once walk come through the shed blood of the Lamb - the approach to toxicities again with God through the blood through the approach that's God provided for him that was God's first method of approach to himself with the people through the shed blood can the church say Amen no we're not going to get too much in there because really is of consciousness that I'm trying to see the church reach a level of reverence and respect because back in the days of the tearing of Israel the high priests would have to go make sacrifice and kill a lamb once a year for the people and they had to be a certain reverence a certain approach it couldn't be our going in because God end up getting so upset with the casual nature with people offering sacrifices and it became so traditional that it honors literally kill something for me tuna it became normal it became ordinary and they lost the sincerity they lost the reverence they lost the respects it became a routine it became a ritual they begin to take it for granted it became normal it became ordinary it became something to do and that's what I want to see in your heart to search your heart this morning that every service for you should be approached with the same type of reverence and respect because every service the blood is being applied over your life every time the word is spoken from the pulpit is blood covering you this war is blood this one is power that's what is life can the church same Oh hallelujah are you getting it something this morning so the call has gone out and we must have the right approach to God with our attitude with our prayer life with how we see God with our attitude to one another and I share with the church in our closing comments last week about the five pillars of respect and with the Branham speaks on it I don't never get to the course today but about respect for God it starts with respect for God because if you respect Gandhi will approach his house a certain way you will approach his silver in the silicon way you will approach one another a certain way even your knife you will approach the situation that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost are you giving your body to respect are you living a life that the Holy Ghost will want to comment do you respect God enough to understand it if it shows you that you don't belong to yourself your bodies that you owned your hands are not your own your feet and not your own so how dare you carry God's body where should not be because he paid for you on Calvary with blood he purchased your salvation he purchased your Redemption he made a way for you how could you throw it back in God's peace by taking what he people I'm doing what you want with it God forgive us this morning for not loving him as much as he loved us for not appreciating what he did for us that they could be a way for us to have an approach to him to be able to speak to him face to face oh how I want to see him to look upon his face as you tired of just coming to church and you want to see God and see the reality but a random set of the Living God can we check our approach this morning can we become a church built on respects respect for God respect for his service respect for one he said last week but the Branum taught us if you don't respect the man respect the office you'll because you don't know what the manners going through don't know what the person next to you is going through but if you live with respect them but the benefit is that is respect for people I love it's just trapping everybody the garbage man respect for the neighbor because cause demands respect we we owe him respect his kingdom is built on respect can the church say men and in this country in particular we are very disrespectful country I have seen and I'm travel to countries where the culture the people they are far more respectful in their natures respectful you see a line up here they all line up here you tell she means line up here you see five lines and that's my brother Bannerman let's see message I believe he said you know what he said he has traveled also and he's seen the same Holy Ghost the people who didn't know the right and on the left and where the Holy Ones come upon them they act the same way it doesn't matter what country they came from so it means that happens people in Trinidad I'm preaching into the church now god bless you those are the internet if people in shouldn't have tell me they have the Holy Ghost and they have no respect then dies not you do because the Holy Ghost brings humility the only war brings respect we wanna go swings love one for another not just one for another but equal to love your enemy so you can love me too that's what the Holy Ghost says can I get a witness in the house [Applause] the Holy Ghost brings one consistent behavior because it's the spirit from another dimension from a different world is not tied to your nationality or your race or how you grew up almost money I have the Holy Ghost has one behavior it's fully it has one behavior is respectful it has one behavior it's honest it has one behavior it wants to please God that's the Holy Ghost that's why the property if you want to get the Holy Ghost spend time with people who have the Holy Ghost if you want to attract the Holy Ghost and we preach it the Holy Ghost is like a dove it's preach right and the dog clone it is another lamb because that lamb spirit is what attracted of the dr. Lanning or no lion or ball no ox but that lamb spirit that meek spirits a lot of other purchases like a type of a butterflies it comes in gently and address on you but if you a cop it's gonna fly away so you want to be a sweet gentle humble spirit that's what God is looking for you're not drunk today not worried if he could take care of the birds and the bees he could Tiki of you there's no worrying there's no being upset is not being angry and you want to attract the holy laws we know I didn't cook it and go and put on loudspeaker brothers be where they are there's no I Quinn cook peace always humble be there when I say that and God met him and walking only meet you and in your eyes version if Peter was there all your wrongs we gotta wait in the tall to get any right spirit there's something to be said about being in the right spirit you mean the right crew even Jesus let us spend time praying because it brought an atmosphere when you talk to God can the church seaman is anybody here this morning so like I said this morning is not as much of preaching as having a conversation about your approach to God you can't have a court case and short on your own time you can have a court case and you dress how you wanna say well your honor this is how listen I leave my house so every day teachers don't want to hear that there's our order years ago some of the older brothers we know where there was a brother who had a court matter and went in the court in the message and wild judges in the courtroom he lifted hands as the Lord gory were the only true judge in the courtroom [Applause] and the judge waited until he finished and then it judge did what he had to do because in his courtroom he is like God in his courtroom and that's why scripture through history that white wig that the judges wore they were actually representing the judgment seat of God because God is the judge so how could you come to the house of God when the judge is watching every move you make and he send out a call because you couldn't come unless he call we read the court that if there is any desire in your heart to come to church to come to the words agree the Bible is because God please something in it if there was nothing please in there you would be drunk somewhere doing some craziness somewhere else doing whatever you wanted but the fact that you actually responded no requires an approach approach that is peace and respect so that approach would define how you dress that approach would define how you walk that approach to God would define what time you come to church that approach with the final you live and how you go to work in the morning because you are no longer living for yourself because you responded to the call you are no part of the economy of God and the balance that is reset because advertisement border so God has you in your company in your school in your neighborhood as a display of his glory as it is free of his grief as it is play of his mercy as a lighthouse in the darkness that even though it's that there will be light in the evening time because there's some individuals who are responded to the call with the right approach the right attitude [Applause] so this morning we're dealing with the right approach it would be strange and I'm sincere again there is a call that goes out to elect that you can only respond to if God please the desire in you to respond but even though people respond and they show up and they take up a seat in church there's an approach to taking it to the next level because that call is also looking to the unseen because you don't know where you want to go you don't know where this journey will take you but you are responding to a call but the one thing we know is how to approach we are brought through the blood we approach with humility and as we're balancing if there's a question in your heart about something leave it alone protect yourself because you're in sponding to our cause in a resurrection you're responding to the cause of the rapture and your life definition of what makes you operate is not a different a different rule book young people are you with me so I'm going to say it again because I want it to stick and I know after service we're gonna have some comments on it but people do wear things when it comes to conventions and meetings and services kind of fancy new hairstyles interesting outfits I'm just leave it like that is that your approach to God who are you approaches who you're trying to impress are you trying to impress man or good I need young people in here even if your parents won't tell you something and it's shame on your parent if they're doing because it means you're weak because even if you turn on activate it's still better to tell them the truth and let the truth hang over them we have in church this morning Babel T in the lattice chiral ruler Arizona talk about turning the script upside down and the disrespect the young people have to their parents God will judge that because the Bible has audio modern your father that is neither belong so disrespecting a parent is the fastest way to cut your life short the only command with the pump I don't care how old you are it doesn't matter what they do your parents deserve respect there's a new trend that exists where people discuss who is the man of the house because it is said in some relationships the woman might be more dominant and the man might be quieter anyway not talking about it was not true from the beginning be that as it may it doesn't matter if the money nose is quiet he still deserves respect because you still priests of the house God did not place that responsibility on the woman oh we we we we gonna get some feedback on this one but it is the truth only the truth will set us free you know and the approach to God and the approach must be built on respects how could you approach God listening to worldly music how could you approach God when you want to live different in the world to accommodate your approach to the world you have approach to your boss you have an approach to your co-workers and you want have your own approach to God your life has to be an approach because God is everywhere looking at everything the testimony you have is not supposed to be a church that's the money it must be a life kept the money they took not that they have been with Jesus can we keep it real this morning I guess I'm not preaching now this is having a conversation because if you don't approach the next few days of your life right you could be cut off because the Bible says he kita Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is named so godly is a time limit on Redemption and that's front seat it's not a mercy seat it's a seat of judgment and because there's blood under seat it's a mercy seat but it's really a judgment seat and judgment is hanging over the years these floods and this happening it's only gonna get worse one day there'll be such a flood that people won't be able to move around quick I prophesied wars and rumors of wars that come and that's happening the judgment is on the earth there's no time to quito for what the world has there's no time for this to be off ritual or formality this has to be your reality this has to be your priority this must be what wakes you up in the morning Lord and you're coming and I want to be ready Lord my son is an under the blood Oh God touch him this morning bring it back to you a burden in your soul for God a burden in your heart for the things of God answer me in my house we will serve the Lord every day you claim it you eat it you don't allow the world to distract you you know louder the bills and the baggage and because one day that will be over I also come as soon as you know what will you excuse me no didn't answer the call because I had too much work I didn't answer the call because I was too busy friends we have to respond to the call we preach the message some time ago no more excuses how the invitation went out to come to this upon one man catches board capital and a half to do business what be the land absolutism and they were all so busy to answer the call I want the master go to the highways go to the pie ways because my meal will be full somebody is going to respond to the call demon up it up a bit when you're gonna respond and I'm going to clothe them I'm gonna get them a garment at the wall away I'm not going to ask them where they come from they're gonna be hold it wanna be lame you want to be pride didn't wanna have your shoes but they're gonna be alright because I'm gonna take care of them my shop or my dinner tables will be full normal raise up whoever you wants to because this message will not fall to the ground it's reality there's power in the message hallelujah Oh friends I charge you I challenge you have the right attitude have your right attitude to your brother to your sister there is no excuse there is no exception there is no excuse there's no exception have the right attitude to the house of God there are things of God have the right attitude to the servants of God to the past but the elders of the minister density - everyone has the right attitude not right nobody off because God is still working on you and he's still working on me Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm getting ready to wind down oh my my my my mind I'm gonna skip through here mmm Oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah friend I believe the season has changed a change had to come for the disciples to go into the upper room they were not in the upper room and under the best of circumstances they were actually hiding and living in fear but they were right where God wanted them they had been rejected they were being ridiculed they were being persecuted but they were right where God wanted them and we have to be the reproach of this message we have to be at a reproach of our testimony that there will be a revival they are those that would have us believe the revival is already finished their doors I believe this message is just about getting ready so I don't do what because there's no burden there's no zeal there's no try there's no cry it there's no sign there's all worship but that's not our testimony friends we are on the expectation and really the promise of God until we fear come to pass we have lost too many young people and as I said in Nigeria we will not be silent we will break our silence and we will call for fire we will break our silence and we will call for charity we will break our silence and not sit and wait for something to happen but we are going to cause something to happen we are going to cause something to happen with our prayer we will cause some of the album with our worship we will cause something to happen with our spying on crime despite our child we all have child but that doesn't change the fact that God is still on the throne and he is still about to pour all the Holy Ghost waiting for individuals to approach him the right way and say Lord you made a promise of snow bring the promise of passes can the church amen Oh hallelujah are you free this morning and who the son of man set free is free indeed so it doesn't matter how your yesterday was how your past was that here we have a fresh opportunity every time the Sun rises in the morning it's a sign of a new day of a new chance it's a span of the resurrection that yesterday is over your past is over as they have since become an intensity and then this time that we have we have the opportunity to pull down charity we have the opportunity to make something happen we have the opportunity to catch a vision and the track team is for hallelujah mind you may be seated so friends just to nail it down there's a corner goes out and only those who have that feed that Jim who is born you can respond to our call but their response has to be with the right attitude so when God called Abraham gave a ham said yes sir he left his family he responded to his call he his family and he left the header city whose maker and below is God he didn't know where he was going he didn't know what Tony was going to live him he didn't know what house you're gonna have he didn't know what tires gonna thrive he didn't know what chop he was going to have but he was responding to the call and that's a piece we ought to have as believers I don't know what house I'm gonna live him I don't know what Tom would've tried but I'm responding to the call because they've caught call you he's more than able to take care of you if he picked you he's gonna make sure I bring you to your end that he plans for you don't disappear don't try to figure it out just keep on walking just keep on following because he is the one who's leading he said I'll never leave you that alone should be comfort that I'll never forsake you are to even look as if you are all alone here there you may not see him but he's there because he can alive he said I will never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you respond to the call he himself listen you may be seated listen friends the Bible says angels and camp around all that fear him I'm not even talking about that because Jesus said I will never leave you I will never take you so they are angels who are tend to protect you but the Lord Himself he is also with you because he is a comforter he is the guy he is the way he is the truth he is the life he is the light he is the way make up so every step that you take a picture the order by God because you're not responding to your own call you are responding to his calls and his call is a bright dog it's a resurrection call it's a cause of the rapture it's a quarter a wedding supper it's a course in a resurrection my and we look to the unseen listen when a man once catches the vision brother branham said and looking at your team of the invisible God I know he's always present that's what we're talking about now listen when a man recision to get ready one catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present listen this summer that stabilizes that man sinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it will still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he is looking at the unseen yet by promise now Abraham not ordinary speedy unseen the reason he believed it was because God said it and if we be dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and it's a spirit that was in Christ wells in us it does the same thing it takes every divine promise of God that's in the Bible and calls it present tense and read itself right there and the church say Amen looking at the unseen mine II I'm get ready to close up T boom on the balance table there's the Living God and when we lose our disbelief and I will unbelief in him and past that place that the world is seeing that these are burglars past it makes you chic oh there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost it makes you wonder but if you just look at the unseen to the God who promises for the promise is unto you and your children to them that is afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call if you look to the blessed word that said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever turn your heads towards that and press on until you pass that vibration pass the unbelief barriers and the sin barriers and all the barriers that seems to hinder you then you will slide three in the face of God knowing that all things are possible then there is no limit they see hardly to the plane that will go if the no limit to the speed of play will goal there's no limit to the blessing that God will pour down upon a believer that will believe and the church CMM some speaking to believers this morning because when abandoned waters God could only prove his word by believers so God has to have some believers believing his word and because they believe they get into action because they responded a call and that call comes at the sound of a trumpet the truly trumpet and when that song comes as a jubilee trumpet all the teams around you have to be broken and the chains around you will begin to fall off and as a change again the fall off you be going to get lighter and lighter and your couldn't begin to go away and when your pledges begin to go away because God said it my yoke is easy and my burden is light it's getting ready for a meeting in the air that you become so like one of these days you'll get so light a rapture it's going to go and the rapture is going to take place but I always believe in my heart before we need this please we are not going to leave here merely making it we're not going to leave here ple hanging on we're gonna leave it with a shout we're gonna leave you jumping we're gonna leave yet handsome because of families have been delivered we're gonna leave knowing that the revival of we preach about has come to pass we're going to leave with such joy because not only will respond to the call but God Himself will answer and if we avoid a trumpet I will call out because the voice of God is a trumpet the voice recordings under the core voice of war was flash and we external eyesand Mina Lord richly bless you [Music] can we panic it alone and afraid this morning Oh hallelujah I read the respond to the ball are you on the expectation for what Korver do then get ready for it middle of this you can imagine embrace today in a worship today hallelujah [Music] he's got a man
