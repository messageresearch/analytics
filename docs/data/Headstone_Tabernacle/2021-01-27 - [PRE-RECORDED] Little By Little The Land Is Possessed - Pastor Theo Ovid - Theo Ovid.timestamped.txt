[6:56] 20.
[7:01] behold i sent an angel before thee to
[7:04] keep thee in the way
[7:06] and to bring thee into the place which i
[7:08] have prepared
[7:10] beware of him obey his voice
[7:14] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[7:16] your transgressions
[7:18] for my name is in him but if thou
[7:21] shalt indeed obey his voice
[7:25] and do all that i speak
[7:29] then i will be an enemy unto dying
[7:32] enemies
[7:33] and an adversary unto dying adversaries
[7:37] for my angels shall go before thee and
[7:40] bring thee in
[7:41] unto the amorites and the hittites
[7:45] and the parasites and the canaanites
[7:48] the hivites the jebusites
[7:52] and i will cut them off thou shalt not
[7:55] bow down to their gods
[7:56] nor save them nor do after their works
[8:00] but thou shalt utterly overthrow them
[8:03] and quite break down their images
[8:07] you shall serve the lord your god and he
[8:09] shall bless thy bread
[8:11] and thy water i will take sickness
[8:14] away from the midst of thee there shall
[8:17] nothing cast the young nor be
[8:19] barren in thy land the number of thy
[8:22] days i will fulfill
[8:24] i will send my fear before thee and will
[8:27] destroy
[8:28] all the people to whom thou shalt come
[8:31] and i will make all my
[8:33] enemies turn their backs onto thee
[8:36] i will send hornets before thee which
[8:39] shall
[8:39] drive out the hivite the king the night
[8:42] the hittite from before thee
[8:45] i will not drive them out from before
[8:49] thee in one year
[8:51] lease the land become desolate
[8:55] and the beasts of the field multiply
[8:59] against thee by little and
[9:02] little i will drive them out from before
[9:05] they
[9:06] until thou be increased and inherit the
[9:09] land
[9:10] and i will set thy bonds from the red
[9:12] sea even
[9:13] unto the sea of the philistines
[9:17] and from the desert unto the rivers and
[9:19] for i will deliver the inhabitants
[9:21] of the land into your hand and those
[9:23] shall drive them out before thee
[9:25] thou shalt make no covenant with them
[9:28] nor with their gods
[9:29] they shall not dwell in thy land least
[9:32] they make thee
[9:33] sin against me for if you
[9:36] serve their gods it will surely be a
[9:39] snare
[9:40] unto thee let's go across to deuteronomy
[9:44] chapter 7.
[10:04] reading from verse 17.
[10:17] if those are seen in heart these nations
[10:20] are more than i
[10:22] how can i dispossess them
[10:26] thou shalt not be afraid of them but
[10:29] shall well remember what the lord thy
[10:32] god
[10:33] did unto pharaoh and onto all
[10:36] egypt the great temptations which then
[10:39] eyes saw
[10:40] and the signs and the wonders and the
[10:42] mighty hand and the stretched out arm
[10:44] wherewith the lord thy god
[10:46] brought thee out so shall the lord thy
[10:48] god do
[10:49] unto all the people of whom thou art
[10:51] afraid moreover
[10:52] the lord thy god will send the hornet
[10:54] among them until
[10:56] they that are left and hide themselves
[10:58] from thee
[10:59] be destroyed thou shalt not be afraid
[11:02] of them for the lord thy god is among
[11:04] you almighty god and terrible
[11:07] and the lord thy god will put out those
[11:09] nations before thee
[11:11] by little and little though me has not
[11:14] consumed them at once
[11:16] leaves the beast of the field increased
[11:18] upon thee
[11:19] but the lord thy god shall deliver unto
[11:21] thee and shall destroy them
[11:23] with a mighty destruction until they be
[11:26] destroyed
[11:28] and he shall deliver their kings into
[11:30] their hand thine hand
[11:32] and thou shall destroy their name from
[11:34] under heaven
[11:35] there shall no man be able to stand
[11:37] before thee until thou have destroyed
[11:39] them
[11:40] the graven images of their gods shall be
[11:42] burned with fire
[11:43] thou shalt not desire the silver
[11:47] or gold that is on them
[11:50] nor take it unto thee lease
[11:54] they'll be sneered therein for it is an
[11:57] abomination
[11:58] to the lord thy god neither shall thou
[12:01] bring an abomination into thine house
[12:05] least there will be cursed thing like it
[12:08] but those shall utterly detest it and
[12:11] thou shalt utterly abhor it

[20:20] peas you cut your peanut pans and
[20:22] potatoes they cut champagne and plant
[20:24] some
[20:24] body or whatever it is isn't that right
[20:26] but if you're cut and you don't maintain
[20:28] and clean
[20:28] then the grass go back here you cut then
[20:31] the grass go back here you cut then the
[20:32] grass go back

[20:37] because you wasn't able to take it
[20:40] possess it
[20:41] manage it overcome it hallelujah
[20:45] that is how you're going to overcome
[20:46] from here on out
[20:48] [Applause]
[20:50] little by little so tell the devil you
[20:54] are a liar
[20:56] i am going to overcome i'll let the
[20:59] devil know up front
[21:01] because they don't want to put all this
[21:02] in front of you look at you look at that
[21:04] look at that
[21:05] forget that start right here
[21:09] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you
[21:12] i'm not hearing you i want to help you
[21:15] guys shout in the house
[21:17] [Applause]
[21:21] don't let the devil trick you to say
[21:22] look at that look at that look all that
[21:24] you haven't welcome
[21:25] say yet i overcome that
[21:28] yet but i'm coming to get you
[21:32] you devil you but little by little
[21:34] praise god i'm going to take this lamb
[21:38] we are starting today take note of this
[21:42] day on your calendar
[21:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[21:50] oh glory to god glory to god
[21:54] there is a reason why god still little
[21:56] by little
[21:57] because we want you to be able to
[21:59] effectively manage
[22:00] you see that's the problem if somebody
[22:03] can't manage
[22:04] a hundred dollars why give them 10 000.
[22:09] they don't need more money they need
[22:10] counseling
[22:13] they need the technique how to manage
[22:15] little there's a rule in that
[22:18] because the scriptures are he that is
[22:21] faithful in little
[22:22] going to be faithful in much so god does
[22:26] test you with little before he give you
[22:28] much
[22:30] god will test you and your attitude to
[22:32] the little
[22:33] that is given to you and if you could
[22:36] effectively
[22:37] manage little god knew he could put
[22:40] much on your hands okay the lord i shout
[22:45] give our lord a praise all glory to
[22:48] god so when you have mean bad attitudes
[22:51] to what offered to you to what's given
[22:53] to you it just goes to show you ain't
[22:55] ready yet
[22:56] oh hallelujah you may be seated
[22:59] look at that little task that god give
[23:03] the david father give him to do carry
[23:06] these
[23:07] is for your brothers it's a little task
[23:10] difficult to say daddy you have nothing
[23:12] for me to do all that journey
[23:14] to carry some food for my brothers but
[23:17] you see
[23:18] in that little task it had some hidden
[23:20] things inside the deer
[23:22] in that little task god wanted to bring
[23:24] david from the back
[23:26] to the front and god had to use a little
[23:29] thing
[23:30] just to be a messenger just to be a
[23:32] carrier
[23:33] just to be put in something for not you
[23:37] for your brethren and and they they look
[23:39] like they like david
[23:41] they look like their problems with david
[23:43] but still david said them fellas give me
[23:45] trouble already daddy i'm not going no
[23:47] it was a little task but in that little

[54:43] let's read what happened there from
[54:45] verse 18 jesus chapter seven
[54:48] and when joshua's had a fight and
[54:50] started to lose men they say what is
[54:52] this something is wrong because god said
[54:54] he will make our enemies stay in their
[54:56] backs no we turn our backs on me running
[54:59] so then they know something was wrong
[55:01] then they go to the camp
[55:03] tribe by tribe family by family
[55:07] household by household man by
[55:11] man when they come to this family
[55:14] akan got called out verse 18 of joshua
[55:17] chapter 7
[55:18] and he brought his household man by man
[55:20] and achan
[55:21] the son of kami the son of zadie the son
[55:24] of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken
[55:26] and judged on the eakin my son gave i
[55:28] pray thee glory to god
[55:31] and make confession unto him tell me
[55:33] what that was done
[55:34] hide it not from me and he can answer
[55:35] them just once said indeed i have sinned
[55:37] against the lord thy god
[55:39] and thus and thus have i done when i saw
[55:42] aha that's what his eyes were saying
[55:45] he saw something isn't that right when i
[55:47] saw among the spoils a goodly
[55:50] babylonician garment and 200
[55:53] shackles of silver and a wedge of gold
[55:55] of 50 shekels weighed
[55:57] i coveted them and took them
[56:01] he's handling it now have it in his eyes
[56:04] how it in his heart you have it and
[56:06] touching that we have in his hands
[56:08] isn't that right and he hid in the earth
[56:10] in the midst of my tent
[56:11] and his silver under it so joshua sent
[56:14] messengers
[56:14] ran into the tent behold it was hidden
[56:16] in his tent the silver under it
[56:18] and they took them out in the midst of
[56:20] the tent brought them unto joshua
[56:22] and unto all the children of israel and
[56:24] lay them all before the lord
[56:25] and joshua and all israel with him took
[56:27] aikan the son of zira
[56:29] and the silver and the garment and the
[56:31] wedge of gold
[56:32] and his sons and his daughters his oxen
[56:35] his asses
[56:36] his sheep his tent and all he had and
[56:38] they brought them to the valley of echo
[56:40] and joshua said why has thou troubled us
[56:43] the lord shall trouble you this day
[56:44] and all israel stone him with stones and
[56:47] burn them with fire
[56:48] after they had stone him with stones and
[56:50] they raised over him
[56:51] a great heap of stone unto this day so
[56:54] the lord turn away the fierceness of his
[56:56] anger

[1:14:48] take this evil spirit from me
[1:14:49] from drinking from gambling from lying

[1:14:57] something to do
[1:14:58] they'll overcome shall inherit all
[1:15:00] things they're overcome you have power
[1:15:02] to do it
[1:15:02] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:15:04] she has made herself ready
[1:15:06] i like that word oh hallelujah
[1:15:09] if god calls you are we ready
[1:15:12] he intends for you to have it
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:16] let me just say from words before that
[1:15:18] healing is yours
[1:15:19] salvation is yours the holy spirit is
[1:15:22] yours
[1:15:22] the real holy spirit is yours if god
[1:15:26] calls you he intends for you to have it
[1:15:29] but you have to fight every inch of the
[1:15:31] way to get it
[1:15:32] oh hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:15:37] do you believe that yet abraham had the
[1:15:39] right to the promise
[1:15:40] and the promise is yet a fight to
[1:15:42] possess it there you are the believer
[1:15:44] today
[1:15:45] watch we are here to all things yet we
[1:15:47] are heir to every spiritual blessing
[1:15:49] every physical blessing every blessing
[1:15:50] in the bible promises yeah you're a
[1:15:52] writer fight every infrared
[1:15:54] that's the way god got it set up it's
[1:15:56] always been that way
[1:15:57] you have to fight to possess what you
[1:16:00] know
[1:16:00] is your own that's the rub
[1:16:04] that's the rub once you know is your own
[1:16:07] now i'm beginning to understand
[1:16:08] god wants me to be adopted
[1:16:12] for knowledge look back pray election
[1:16:14] look back to four knowledge
[1:16:16] but predestination look back to destiny
[1:16:18] and what is god predestinated us
[1:16:21] unto adoption where full authority and
[1:16:23] power is come back to the church
[1:16:26] but watch this the adopted son he must
[1:16:27] have dominion over himself
[1:16:31] so if i want to be adopted i have to
[1:16:33] begin to understand
[1:16:34] and operate dominion over me
[1:16:38] that theo could come out of the way that
[1:16:40] god could be glorified
[1:16:42] so i have to fight today
[1:16:47] do you understand what i'm saying not
[1:16:49] only fight to live
[1:16:51] but fight to die oh hallelujah

[1:17:46] real christian
[1:17:47] fight for his position amen
[1:17:51] he has to stand alone him and god and he
[1:17:53] fights every inch of ground
[1:17:54] so you don't have a baby and
[1:17:56] that's what the matter with the
[1:17:57] pentecostal church today
[1:17:59] we got pentecostal babies that's just
[1:18:00] been sprinkled and sprayed
[1:18:02] not really born again genuine feet born
[1:18:05] into people
[1:18:06] luke 16 10 to 12 says this
[1:18:10] he that is faithful in that which is
[1:18:11] least
[1:18:13] is faithful to that which isn't much
[1:18:16] here is unjust in the least is unjust
[1:18:18] also in march
[1:18:20] if therefore you have not been faithful
[1:18:23] in the unrighteous mammon
[1:18:25] who will commit to you two witches if
[1:18:28] you have not been faithful in that which
[1:18:30] is another man's
[1:18:31] how shall you get what is your own
[1:18:34] that's powerful
[1:18:36] listen to this in the amplified he who
[1:18:39] is fearful in a very little thing
[1:18:41] is faithful in much and he who is
[1:18:44] dishonest and unjust in a very little
[1:18:45] thing
[1:18:46] is this honest and adjusting much
[1:18:48] therefore if you are not being faithful
[1:18:50] in the case of unrighteous man which is
[1:18:52] deceitful riches
[1:18:53] money and possessions who will entrust
[1:18:54] you with two riches and if you have not
[1:18:57] proven faithful in that which belongs to
[1:18:58] another
[1:18:59] whether god or man who will give that
[1:19:02] which is for your own
[1:19:03] which is two riches these are the last
[1:19:06] words i have here
[1:19:08] when you are strong to manage the little
