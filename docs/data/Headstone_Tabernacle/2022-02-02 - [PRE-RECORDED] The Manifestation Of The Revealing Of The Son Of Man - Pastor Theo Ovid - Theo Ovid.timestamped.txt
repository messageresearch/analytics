[20:40] talking about now the beast all
[20:42] not some
[20:44] all that dwell upon the earth shall

[20:52] of life of the lamb
[20:54] slain

[21:11] killed with the sword here is the
[21:13] patience
[21:14] and the fate of the saints
[21:16] and i beheld another beast coming out of
[21:18] the earth
[21:20] and he had two horns like a lamb
[21:23] and he speak
[21:24] as a dragon
[21:26] and he exercised it
[21:28] all the power of the first beast before
[21:30] him
[21:32] and caused the earth
[21:34] and them which dwell therein to worship
[21:36] the first beast

[22:44] where we're looking for the bright
[22:45] promise to be realized
[22:48] where we looking for the bright promise
[22:49] to be confirmed
[22:51] certainly appreciate but anthony's
[22:52] message last sunday
[22:54] press
[22:56] into the kingdom of god
[22:59] is almost as if god put that ability in
[23:01] the eagles
[23:03] to press
[23:04] to look beyond obstacles and
[23:06] circumstance
[23:07] to look beyond conditions and
[23:08] frustration
[23:10] and just believe that you got a press
[23:12] you're gonna make it
[23:13] oh glory to god you love him this
[23:15] morning

[23:55] and the beast system
[23:57] wake up people as a wake-up service this
[23:59] morning
[24:00] not just for revival for understanding
[24:03] to uh modern events made clear by
[24:06] prophecy
[24:07] for an understanding of what has taken
[24:08] miss right around you that is not a joke
[24:11] it's not a game
[24:13] god sent a real prophet
[24:15] a 20th century prophet not them crystal
[24:18] ball prophet
[24:20] not these bogus modern day prophet but a
[24:23] real
[24:24] 20th century prophet
[24:26] who went up in the sphere of god
[24:29] and brought the prophecy for you and i
[24:32] hallelujah hallelujah
[24:34] glory to god you will be caesar
[24:36] this prophet identify
[24:38] america scripture
[24:40] as revelation chapter 13
[24:42] that's where america is at
[24:44] spoke like a lamb at first but it will
[24:46] always speak like a lamb because the
[24:48] bible prophesy that same lamb voice will
[24:52] speak like the beast
[24:53] but speak like a dragon it has already
[24:56] begun
[24:57] the titan has already begun he said it's
[24:59] going to be a tightening you know what a
[25:01] titan is slowly
[25:03] it's just coming you're not in this
[25:05] squeezing it yet no it's a tightly and
[25:07] they're just tightening it slowly and
[25:09] slowly all of a sudden
[25:11] wake up and recognize there's no more
[25:13] freedom of religion
[25:14] hallelujah oh yes the sodomites are free
[25:17] the gays are free
[25:19] but the christians no longer freedom of
[25:21] religion
[25:22] this is what the bible prophesied so you
[25:25] can just sit in church
[25:27] as if you are somebody
[25:30] wake up this morning
[25:32] god is able
[25:33] to raise up stones
[25:36] to shout
[25:37] to praise
[25:39] to worship
[25:41] god will have to take these dead bunch
[25:43] of church members in this message
[25:45] hallelujah
[25:47] god is able to send out the voice
[25:50] and the spirit
[25:52] and the bride
[25:54] shall come
[25:55] whosoever will
[25:57] come true
[25:58] oh glory to god
[26:01] we're gonna have a revival give the lord
[26:03] a shout
[26:10] oh
[26:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[26:14] you may be seated praise god
[26:16] so my title
[26:18] i'm not ready to speak it this morning
[26:20] but i believe i want to put the title to
[26:22] this thought
[26:23] the manifestation
[26:25] of the revealing
[26:27] of the son of man
[26:29] it's an odd title for the scripture to
[26:30] be read
[26:31] but you'd rather worry about that
[26:33] your worry is to shout and the praise
[26:36] god and to get to the spirit
[26:38] and let god speak to your heart
[26:40] amen
[26:42] revelation 3 21 he might overcome it
[26:44] well i granted me my throne
[26:47] even as i also overcame and sat down
[26:49] with my father in his throne
[26:51] now what are we to overcome
[26:53] this is the normal question to ask here
[26:55] but that is not the actual thought of
[26:57] this verse
[26:58] it is not so much what we have to
[27:01] overcome
[27:02] but how
[27:04] we are to overcome now this is logical
[27:07] for does it matter what we have to
[27:08] overcome
[27:09] as long as we know how we can overcome
[27:13] a quick look at the scriptures which
[27:14] involve the lord jesus overcoming will
[27:17] bring all the truth of this proposition
[27:19] in matthew 4 jesus
[27:22] tempted of the devil
[27:23] he overcame like this the personal
[27:26] temptations of satan
[27:29] by the word
[27:31] and by the word only
[27:33] in each of his three major trials that
[27:35] corresponding exactly to the temptation
[27:39] the gardener eden the lust of the flesh
[27:41] the lust of the eye the pride of life
[27:43] jesus overcame by the word
[27:46] eve fell
[27:47] to the personal temptation of satan
[27:51] by failing to use the word
[27:53] adam fell
[27:55] in direct disobedience to the word
[27:58] but jesus overcame by the word
[28:01] and right now
[28:03] let me say this is the only way to be an
[28:05] overcomer
[28:06] is also the only way that you can know
[28:09] if you are overcoming because that word
[28:12] can't fail
[28:14] that word can't feel
[28:17] say can't feel
[28:19] say that word
[28:21] can't fail
[28:22] give the lord a praise offering
[28:28] notice again
[28:30] how jesus overcame the world systems of
[28:32] religion
[28:34] when he was repeatedly battered by the
[28:36] theologian of his name
[28:38] he constantly applied the word
[28:41] he spake only what the father give him
[28:43] to speak there was not a time when the
[28:46] world
[28:47] was not utterly confused by his wisdom
[28:49] for it was the wisdom of god
[28:52] in his own personal life
[28:54] contending with himself
[28:56] he overcame by obedience to the word of
[28:58] god
[28:59] hebrews 5 7 said it says who in the days
[29:02] of his flesh when he had offered up
[29:04] prayers and supplications with strong
[29:06] crime and tears unto him that was able
[29:09] to save him from debt and was heard in
[29:12] that he feared though he was a son
[29:14] yet learned the obedience by the things
[29:18] which he suffered
[29:20] and being made perfect became the order
[29:23] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[29:25] obey him
[29:26] what was he obedient to
[29:28] the word
[29:30] now then
[29:32] there will not be here we go one person
[29:35] who will sit in the throne of the lord
[29:37] jesus christ unless he has been living
[29:40] that word
[29:41] [Applause]
[29:43] [Music]
[29:44] your prayers
[29:46] your fastings
[29:48] your repentances
[29:50] no matter what you present to god
[29:53] none of that
[29:55] will gain you the privilege
[29:57] of sitting in that throne
[29:59] it will be granted only to the word
[30:01] bride
[30:02] as the throne of the king is shared with
[30:05] the queen
[30:06] because she is to be united to him
[30:09] so only they who are of that word
[30:13] even as he is of that word will share
[30:15] that room
[30:17] remember
[30:18] we have shown clearly all through the
[30:20] ages that even as adam and eve fell
[30:23] because they left the world
[30:25] so the ephesians is fell by turning
[30:27] slightly from the world
[30:30] until with every age continue to turn
[30:32] away
[30:33] we have a final reputation of the world
[30:35] of by the world church system
[30:39] this
[30:40] loudest age ends in a blackout of the
[30:43] world
[30:45] cross darkness
[30:49] cover the people
[30:50] darkness cover the world
[30:53] so this age end up with the blackout
[30:56] of the world
[30:57] isn't that right
[30:59] thereby listen thereby causing a
[31:01] departure of the lord from the midst
[31:05] [Applause]
[31:05] [Music]
[31:07] so once people depart from the word the
[31:10] lord depart also
[31:12] [Applause]
[31:14] because god is the
[31:16] word god has been his word
[31:19] [Applause]

[33:22] come forth
[33:23] it has to have the sodomites it have to
[33:25] have the lottites the church members and
[33:28] it has to have elohim standing on the

[34:09] this message not some pentecostal
[34:11] message
[34:12] this is christ
[34:13] the solomon that was failed in a prophet
[34:16] came to call a bride out
[34:18] [Applause]
[34:23] let's continue
[34:24] [Applause]
[34:25] look away to jesus
[34:27] prophecy
[34:29] there's coming a time upon this nation
[34:31] to where this nation is going to
[34:33] exercise
[34:34] all the power that the beast had before
[34:37] it
[34:38] which was pagan rome
[34:40] this nation
[34:42] will do that
[34:44] revelation 13 plainly explains it the
[34:46] lamb come out of the earth
[34:50] and the other beast came out of the
[34:51] water
[34:52] and after a while it received power and
[34:54] spoke like a dragon
[34:56] the protestant denomination
[34:58] an image unto the beast
[35:00] making a power that will force all
[35:03] protesting like a union
[35:05] you will have to be
[35:07] in this council of churches
[35:09] or you won't be able to have fellowship
[35:11] it's practically that way right now
[35:14] you can't go and preach unless you have
[35:15] a fellowship card of some identification
[35:19] no we are going to be cut out of that
[35:21] all together
[35:22] cause you won't be able to do it it's a
[35:24] tightening
[35:26] and when that time comes
[35:28] when the press comes to a place
[35:31] where you are pressed out
[35:33] not just pressed
[35:35] but pressed out
[35:36] not just pressed
[35:38] but pressed out you see i'm pushing the
[35:40] buttons this morning to you who are
[35:42] sleeping this church i'm pushing this
[35:44] button this morning for you are
[35:46] comfortable to belong to the message
[35:49] because two days ago the 26 the supreme
[35:51] court of america they tried to redefine
[35:54] what marriage is
[35:56] they never was giving me authority to
[35:58] define it how dare them redefined it
[36:02] hallelujah
[36:03] that's what i'm talking about
[36:05] so one day the supreme court of america
[36:08] could redefine or attempt to redefine
[36:11] what god has defined then they refine
[36:13] the army they define god almighty praise
[36:17] god then

[36:52] the men in sodom were wicked and sinners
[36:55] before the lord
[36:56] exceedingly
[36:58] i wonder if these uh honorable judges of
[37:01] the supreme court would send a memo to
[37:03] god
[37:04] to ask god to apologize
[37:06] for judging sarah gomorrah for their
[37:09] wickedness or they will call what we are
[37:11] preaching a hate speech i wonder if
[37:14] these honorable judges will do that
[37:16] oh my god so now the preachers in
[37:19] america they now bang
[37:21] oh hallelujah
[37:22] because now they have to try to say they
[37:24] have a license a married man a man a
[37:26] woman a woman but god's going to judge
[37:28] the whole thing
[37:29] wallet holy call it america is already

[37:33] sentencing

[47:33] call to perfection oh let's continue oh
[47:36] praise god is a tightening
[47:38] when that time come
[47:40] when the press
[47:41] comes to a place
[47:43] to where
[47:44] you are pressed out
[47:46] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you a
[47:47] few minutes watch it with pull down
[47:50] not depressed no when it pressed come to
[47:53] a place you're like
[47:55] you know what i'm kind of thinking as if
[47:56] i get grinding a long time
[47:58] the mincer
[47:59] you're doing so are they pressing good
[48:02] something like that
[48:03] until you're pressed out
[48:05] now watch spoken word journalists see
[48:08] he said uh watch what you did for then
[48:10] it will be absolutely the total loss but
[48:13] it will be for the bride
[48:15] and the church now understand this
[48:16] friends
[48:17] this gospel by prophecy have to be
[48:20] preached to the eternal loss
[48:23] the people who cannot be saved when when
[48:25] jesus died he ran down to hell he ran
[48:28] down to the lower regions and preached
[48:30] to those people who heard the messages
[48:32] and rejected it they say that they hear
[48:34] it again
[48:35] now just think about it now people are
[48:37] looking for see yes right right and all
[48:39] right and the door is shut
[48:41] signs wonders and miracles and they're
[48:43] trying to get it and they can't
[48:46] i'll compare to noah's ark how long do i
[48:48] preach for 120 years he's preaching the
[48:50] word gets into the ark everybody have
[48:53] their own opinion even our own feelings
[48:55] nor preaching preaching his life out
[48:57] it's still an all-given fight isn't that
[48:59] right but no one's staying with the word
[49:02] bill in the ark all of a sudden god said
[49:04] get the animals in the people supposed
[49:06] to see something had to be happening
[49:08] god not waste in time the animal is
[49:10] coming and something's happening as we
[49:12] always say our sign is not out here
[49:14] our side is inside of here the word
[49:17] isn't that right but i want to show you
[49:19] what is happening out there is direct
[49:21] connection to what happens out of here
[49:24] isn't that right because they have to do
[49:25] their thing to identify the season and
[49:28] time and if sodom has returned i mean
[49:30] the angel is on the earth
[49:32] to speak to abraham
[49:37] are you with me
[49:39] abraham
[49:40] represent the elect
[49:42] and when god came down his words were
[49:45] shall i hide from abraham
[49:47] these mysteries
[49:50] what i'm about to do
[49:53] god was about to release judgment the
[49:56] earthquake earthquakes
[50:01] putin russia is already displaced
[50:04] with the weapons and bombs they already
[50:07] have it they're not fixing to make it
[50:08] next 20 years next 30 years it's already
[50:11] built and we in place
[50:19] we have our bombs
[50:23] we are losing yet but we have our bumps
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:30] we like walking dynamites
[50:32] we are just loaded
[50:34] just as patched
[50:36] light me up
[50:42] oh hallelujah
[50:44] that's not gonna happen to the bride you
[50:45] know what i read for you after a short
[50:49] manifestation and demonstration of the
[50:51] spirit
[50:52] god will take home that haunted
[50:53] persecuted bride
[50:55] afterwards short
[50:57] manifestation people are looking for
[50:59] that they're looking for press they're
[51:00] looking for all kinds of things but not
[51:02] this power what's the use we come under
[51:04] this hour and there's no power
[51:06] then we believe and fail
[51:08] then we have tribulation saints
[51:12] we as mess we are melt we may as well
[51:15] sit down and relax and wait for the
[51:16] tribulation
[51:18] and suck upon food
[51:20] so you can buy yourself unless
[51:24] and all who name not written taking it
[51:27] like like like like a card
[51:30] but but so therefore the only people are
[51:32] not going to bow is just name written
[51:35] now how are people to know their names
[51:37] written if the book is not opened
[51:42] to show them their name
[51:44] and if it's only six years then the book
[51:46] is closed
[51:47] then all you're looking for is the
[51:48] outside syria watching another cevio you
[51:50] know yeah show your book you're opening
[51:51] your name behind it because you're
[51:52] waiting for the break
[51:54] you last already come break all the
[51:55] seals and the mystery has been revealed
[51:58] for you to see your name
[51:59] and we must know when you see your name
[52:01] because depression will just fly out of
[52:03] your life frustration will fly out your
[52:05] life the devils that get frustrated with
[52:07] you
[52:08] because you see your name
[52:10] and you begin to join the heavenly
[52:12] chorus
[52:13] and begin to worship god
[52:15] without studying your son backslidden or
[52:18] your daughter or your husband or your
[52:21] wife or your children you get the devil
[52:24] all mixed up
[52:25] messed up because you worship in god
[52:28] anyhow
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:41] you think the devil
[52:43] enjoys seeing you worshiping god
[52:46] of course not he wanted his worship in
[52:48] heaven
[52:49] and we said no
[52:51] we didn't give him up here
[52:52] we can't get them down here
[52:55] we got calling to bow down tonight
[52:58] praise god
[53:00] jesus told the woman at the well woman
[53:03] the our coming now is
[53:05] when the worshippers know
[53:08] when the
[53:10] true
[53:11] truth
[53:12] when the true that mean ego have false
[53:15] worshipers
[53:16] but it has some
[53:18] true worshipers
[53:20] these people
[53:22] the true ones
[53:23] they're gonna worship
[53:25] in spirit
[53:27] and in truth
[53:31] you may be seated
[53:33] therefore through the ages couldn't have
[53:36] the worship
[53:38] that god wanted
[53:39] because the truth was lost so god has to
[53:42] go and get the truth
[53:44] and pull it up together
[53:46] gather it up
[53:48] in the scattered word
[53:50] tie it back
[53:52] into the word
[53:53] to pull down the spirit
[53:55] all seven seas open
[53:58] then the spirit descended
[54:00] in prophecy
[54:02] for the pride
[54:04] so the spirit descended
[54:06] in the form of the word
[54:08] the lord himself came with a message
[54:12] put it in seed form
[54:14] and he walked
[54:16] he walked
[54:18] oh this is good
[54:19] because he knows
[54:21] that every seed
[54:25] shall bring forth after its king
[54:28] there was a bright seed sword
[54:31] there's got to be a bride
[54:34] to comfort
[54:35] oh glory to god amen are you with me
[54:39] you may be seated
[54:41] but branham
[54:42] he said we are the end time
[54:44] the seeds are sold
[54:46] the latter rain is fixing to comfort
[54:49] remember
[54:50] there will be a denominational gathering
[54:52] pretty soon
[54:54] it will be terrific
[54:56] and they will bring themselves together
[54:58] in this federation of churches and this
[55:01] kind of church
[55:03] will be put out of operation
[55:05] it's at that time
[55:07] that jesus will appear
[55:09] and he will show
[55:10] which is bride
[55:13] and which is not
[55:15] so we are moving into a cycle it is
[55:17] god's clock
[55:19] it's ticking
[55:20] remember christian friends i'm a man
[55:23] i can make mistakes
[55:25] it's oh that's wonderful it are people
[55:27] who believe they can make no mistakes
[55:29] so
[55:30] you know
[55:32] they don't need a eraser so i'm a man
[55:35] i can make mistakes
[55:37] but god being god
[55:39] cannot make a mistake
[55:43] all the words
[55:44] that's been written
[55:46] must be fulfilled
[55:48] jesus said so
[55:50] so we have come things in the scripture
[55:52] that must be fulfilled
[55:54] and that is one of the things this
[55:56] boycott to come
[55:58] but before this boycott come
[56:00] of the marking of the beast
[56:03] there has to be a seed sword for god
[56:06] to take his church out
[56:08] a seed has to be sown
[56:11] and they are going to bring a
[56:12] persecution on pretty soon and shut up
[56:14] all the churches and churches like this
[56:17] who is not a denomination they will use
[56:20] them as storehouses and anything else
[56:23] oh my
[56:24] the angel of the lord the word of the
[56:27] little lamb that wrote up in version 13
[56:29] exercising all the powers before
[56:32] speaking like a dragon
[56:33] a bitter religious persecution
[56:36] we are nearing that time
[56:38] you heard what he said
[56:39] a bitter religious persecution although
[56:42] the pastor in america says he said he
[56:44] never thought
[56:46] that he would live to feel he live in a
[56:48] strange land
[56:50] where the truth is no longer accepted or
[56:52] respected
[56:54] where the rights of others is taken more
[56:56] precedent
[56:57] oh my hallelujah
[56:59] america the start up with freedom of
[57:01] religion god bless our nation they kick
[57:04] god straight out
[57:06] are now waiting for judgment
[57:08] it's rotten on the inside
[57:11] and then the country just falls
[57:13] last great empire and there's a prophecy
[57:15] brahman says that america reject this
[57:17] message god will send it out to another
[57:19] people
[57:20] in another land
[57:22] but god's word can't fail
[57:24] there's a bride around the world
[57:26] that's going to be called out by the
[57:29] mystery of the seventh seal
[57:31] oh blessed be the lord gotta go a little
[57:33] further
[57:34] he said you remember church here we go

[58:11] [Applause]
[58:17] some people don't want to shop
[58:19] you know what happens they don't believe
[58:21] in the best days
[58:22] [Music]
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:27] if you think think bad
[58:30] all right let's do it again church
[58:32] remember you're living the best you ever
[58:34] live ever live right now until jesus
[58:36] come
[58:37] it will gradually not grab gravity but
[58:40] rapidly get worse and worse
[58:42] when russia goes down there to get that
[58:44] oil look out
[58:46] that's all she needs
[58:47] that's what the prophet said it would do
[58:49] and we are ready for it then
[58:52] well that's late knew russia already
[58:54] gone down
[58:55] take crime here and you're all right
[58:57] underneath you're already in position
[58:59] that's what i said russia went and do
[59:01] their business first the supreme court
[59:03] do their business next what about us
[59:06] [Music]
[59:08] what do we have to do
[59:11] the prophet already told us what we see
[59:14] we should make a church
[59:17] that will make a revival
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:22] i'm not hearing you
[59:23] because you're supposed to be scripted
[59:25] on that
[59:26] because the prophet said a minister
[59:28] cannot bring a revival
[59:30] it has to come by you
[59:33] the people
[59:35] i'm not hearing you this morning
[59:37] glory to god hallelujah
[59:40] you have the key
[59:47] so you come with your revival from your
[59:48] home
[59:49] and you come here in the spirit
[59:51] and you unlock the blessings of god
[59:54] and the minister can't stand to minister
[59:56] because you come and unlock a minute
[59:58] lesson heaven start to come down windows
[1:00:01] of heaven open up
[1:00:03] minister have to say what god put in his
[1:00:05] mouth
[1:00:05] he could have a message and god pushed
[1:00:07] that whole thing aside he could have a
[1:00:09] thought on what push his own touch aside
[1:00:11] then your thought move on and the
[1:00:13] thoughts of god move in
[1:00:15] then the words come out of your mouth
[1:00:16] and as a word come on fire comes up
[1:00:20] power comes out
[1:00:22] healing comes up
[1:00:24] you become like a branch
[1:00:26] and he is vine
[1:00:28] and he is the charger
[1:00:30] so you have a power source
[1:00:32] and it seems like a power can go out
[1:00:34] because this power never had a beginning
[1:00:37] this power cannon
[1:00:39] there's not sunlight power
[1:00:41] this is not solar power
[1:00:43] this is not electricity
[1:00:45] this is god's power
[1:00:47] we call it dynamics we can have an
[1:00:49] inside dynamo
[1:00:51] it keeps turning
[1:00:53] and turning
[1:00:54] it can't stop that's why jesus said
[1:00:58] he that believeth on me
[1:01:00] out of his belly shall flow
[1:01:03] rivers
[1:01:04] where those waters coming from
[1:01:06] oh glory to god is a dynamo
[1:01:09] turning in your soul
[1:01:11] to bring up the waters of the holy ghost
[1:01:13] or give the lord a shout of praise
[1:01:15] you've got to see where you're going
[1:01:17] oh glory to god amen
[1:01:20] you may be seasoned
[1:01:21] husband anthony brought us a tremendous
[1:01:23] last sunday
[1:01:24] he said a vision show you where you are
[1:01:26] to go
[1:01:27] or when you look at where you're at how
[1:01:28] could you feel satisfied what you come
[1:01:31] to church for is to get inspiration of
[1:01:33] the direction away supposed to go
[1:01:35] and that could give you wings lift you
[1:01:38] out of your old stuff
[1:01:40] because you see something greater
[1:01:42] than yourself
[1:01:44] what glory to god you see greater than
[1:01:46] you you sit down and mope in your
[1:01:48] selfishness and your carnality but when
[1:01:51] you see something greater you said my
[1:01:53] god that's worth living for that's worth
[1:01:56] pressing for forgetting the thing that i
[1:01:58] pass i press
[1:02:01] or give the lord some glory
[1:02:04] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:08] oh glory
[1:02:10] my
[1:02:11] so church
[1:02:13] oh hallelujah
[1:02:14] glory to god you say the world is in the
[1:02:17] sun condition
[1:02:19] i was a dangerous time for the church
[1:02:20] and it's even time
[1:02:22] because they'll go to church
[1:02:24] and almost be like the pentecostal
[1:02:26] believers
[1:02:28] they will shout down speak with tongues
[1:02:29] everything else so close
[1:02:31] would receive the very like if possible
[1:02:33] but remember
[1:02:34] the only way
[1:02:36] where you know that you are right
[1:02:38] is to follow the conductor the word
[1:02:41] and it brings you into absolute truth
[1:02:44] oh praise god
[1:02:46] and i show us adam and eve had to be the
[1:02:48] same spirit christ and the church has to
[1:02:50] be the same spirit the same ministry the
[1:02:53] things that i do shall you also see what
[1:02:55] i mean they had to unite together flesh
[1:02:57] and blood isn't that right and brother
[1:02:59] bran said my words are bad in you ask
[1:03:01] what you will i am the vine you are the
[1:03:02] branches and the life that was in the
[1:03:04] vine goes into the branch they bear the
[1:03:06] fruit
[1:03:07] fruit bearers
[1:03:08] and every limb that don't bring forth
[1:03:10] fruit is showed off
[1:03:11] and that's where the organization did
[1:03:13] break it up get the word mixed up and
[1:03:15] start off like that
[1:03:16] watch
[1:03:17] god never did
[1:03:19] watch he just prunes it off
[1:03:21] never did an organization ever rise but
[1:03:23] that it fell
[1:03:25] everyone fell never did come back again
[1:03:27] i challenge anybody in history to show
[1:03:30] now notice here we go
[1:03:33] they have to become one
[1:03:35] jesus said the life that's in him will
[1:03:38] be in his church
[1:03:39] and here is exactly what he promised in
[1:03:42] the last days
[1:03:43] are you ready
[1:03:45] that the life
[1:03:47] that was in christ
[1:03:50] will be manifested
[1:03:52] in the days
[1:03:54] that the world is in a sudden condition
[1:04:00] [Applause]

[1:34:45] gross darkness
[1:34:46] cover the people
[1:34:48] oh my

[1:34:56] blanket like a shadow just coming over
[1:34:59] the earth
[1:35:00] people who you taught was intelligent
[1:35:02] and wise and understanding all of a
[1:35:05] sudden like it messed up
[1:35:08] here it is
[1:35:10] the lamb about to speak like a
[1:35:12] dragon it's a tightening
[1:35:15] churches are worried and concerned isn't
[1:35:18] that right not just here not here so
[1:35:20] much in america
[1:35:22] because they don't know what's going to
[1:35:23] happen if somebody come to perform let
[1:35:25] them do that kind of marriage
[1:35:26] how could they define marriage that
[1:35:28] matter the man when god defined marriage
[1:35:29] as a man and a woman
[1:35:31] but that is what is not legal now
[1:35:33] oh my
[1:35:35] sodden condition has returned
[1:35:37] then if that is the case where is elohim
[1:35:40] [Applause]
[1:35:43] coming to visit a bride
[1:35:46] it can be some man
[1:35:48] some we don't intrude that
[1:35:50] it can be some man from america or
[1:35:53] europe or africa or south america it has
[1:35:55] to be the spirit
[1:35:57] because that is what came upon abraham
[1:36:00] so you know what you're looking for
[1:36:02] you're looking for the same thing peter
[1:36:04] was looking for
[1:36:05] when jesus finished with them he said
[1:36:07] receive the holy ghost wait for the
[1:36:09] promise of the father so when they read
[1:36:11] in the upper room they wasn't waiting
[1:36:12] for knock on the door and somebody can't
[1:36:13] tell him it is here
[1:36:16] it came by fedex
[1:36:19] that is not what they're waiting for
[1:36:22] they were waiting worshipping
[1:36:24] they were waiting blessing
[1:36:26] they were waiting in in the atmosphere
[1:36:29] because it's not coming on dry
[1:36:31] every dead church is finished
[1:36:38] and if you stay dead you are finished
[1:36:40] not are you saying that you're finishing
[1:36:42] if you stay dead
[1:36:44] because you have to go in the atmosphere
[1:36:45] that they will end
[1:36:47] and they were dry seas that was
[1:36:48] worshiping
[1:36:50] they were worshiping and praising god
[1:36:51] they wasn't studying this problem and
[1:36:53] that problem they had problems you know
[1:36:54] that bills to pay their things to do
[1:36:57] that cases to deal with but they were
[1:36:59] dealing with the promise of the father
[1:37:04] that's what you come for you're coming
[1:37:06] for a promise
[1:37:08] from your father
[1:37:10] which is the holy ghost
[1:37:12] to empower your life
[1:37:18] to give your strength and power to
[1:37:20] overcome
[1:37:21] power to forgive power to pray power to
[1:37:25] pray through power to stan
[1:37:28] [Applause]
[1:37:31] forward the cast devils out power to
[1:37:34] pray that the blood cover your home
[1:37:38] and demon activity don't be loosed in
[1:37:40] your home
[1:37:44] let me finish
[1:37:46] music please
[1:38:01] this word so will it be in the coming of
[1:38:02] the son of man
[1:38:04] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:38:09] not no more as church here we go
[1:38:12] not no more the bride is called so he's
[1:38:14] prophesying
[1:38:16] in that day
[1:38:18] the son of man will reveal what to join
[1:38:22] are you ready
[1:38:26] you will see where i get the title from
[1:38:28] the solomon will reveal what
[1:38:31] to join the church to the head
[1:38:35] to unite
[1:38:37] the marriage of the bride
[1:38:40] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:38:42] through this when the sonoma will come
[1:38:45] down
[1:38:46] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:38:48] together
[1:38:49] here we go are you ready
[1:38:52] the church
[1:38:53] has to be the word
[1:38:56] he is the word
[1:38:57] and the two unite together
[1:39:01] and to do that here we go it will take
[1:39:05] the manifestation
[1:39:07] of the revealing of the son of man
[1:39:10] not a clergyman
[1:39:12] but the manifestation of the revealing
[1:39:16] so the son of man has been revealed
[1:39:18] it's on books and tips but it can be
[1:39:20] books and tapes to unite us because it
[1:39:23] has brought so much division it will not
[1:39:24] take that it will take the manifestation
[1:39:27] of watching on the books and tapes
[1:39:30] to unite the pride
[1:39:32] with the head
[1:39:33] could we give the lord a shelter pray
[1:39:36] oh
[1:39:37] hallelujah
[1:39:39] oh hallelujah to god
[1:39:41] yeah what he said yeah do you see what i
[1:39:43] mean
[1:39:44] it's son of man gideon they could come
[1:39:45] up
[1:39:46] jesus christ will come down in human
[1:39:48] flesh among us
[1:39:49] here we go and make this word so real it
[1:39:53] would unite the church of him as one
[1:39:55] then she will go home to the wedding
[1:39:57] supper she is reunited we go to the
[1:40:00] wedding supper not to the marriage the
[1:40:02] wedding supper and so forth
[1:40:04] he said not the theologian the son of
[1:40:06] man or praise the name of the lord
[1:40:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:11] hallelujah
[1:40:12] hallelujah hallelujah could we give the
[1:40:15] lord a shout
[1:40:17] i begin the lord of praise
[1:40:19] oh glory to god praise god
[1:40:23] i'm closing a minister said to me not
[1:40:25] long ago a friend of mine but abraham
[1:40:27] god will never let the united states
[1:40:28] fall
[1:40:29] because of the basis of his forefathers
[1:40:31] from the religion i said he let the jews
[1:40:34] sure carried away they had a lot of
[1:40:36] better understanding than what we had
[1:40:38] that's right go and aid the respect of
[1:40:40] some generation that passed you either
[1:40:42] walk the line or you're out of the
[1:40:43] kingdom
[1:40:44] that's pretty rough but it's good for
[1:40:46] you
[1:40:47] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:49] hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:40:52] now watch his disciples they met a man
[1:40:55] cast not devils he was getting the job
[1:40:57] done
[1:40:59] hallelujah so they were very jealous
[1:41:04] so he goes down now here you come
[1:41:06] disciples right now to the man here you
[1:41:08] either come join our ranks or don't do
[1:41:10] that no more
[1:41:12] and a man let them know he didn't have
[1:41:14] to join the denomination
[1:41:15] their ranks he went up there and he
[1:41:17] heard jesus saying whosoever will he
[1:41:19] just receive it and he was getting the
[1:41:21] job done well the disciples said we
[1:41:24] forbid you
[1:41:25] in other words we boycott you we will do
[1:41:28] all of this if you don't do it went back
[1:41:30] until jesus about to jesus said now
[1:41:31] don't you do that because no man can do
[1:41:33] a miracle in my name that could speak
[1:41:35] lightly of me
[1:41:37] isn't that right you see what it was
[1:41:39] petty jealousy of those disciples it was
[1:41:42] in men then it is still in men today
[1:41:45] that's right because that man was
[1:41:47] getting the job done and many times we
[1:41:50] find people who are getting the job done
[1:41:52] that don't belong to our ranks we want
[1:41:54] to flap about it it's just the same
[1:41:56] element and if it was in the church of
[1:41:58] 12 that walk with jesus is going to be
[1:41:59] in this one as the rest of them
[1:42:02] so friends let me say this
[1:42:04] now remember young people here i don't
[1:42:06] know jesus may come this afternoon he
[1:42:08] may come next year i don't know
[1:42:10] but remember if i do not live to see
[1:42:12] that day of his coming i hope that i
[1:42:13] will
[1:42:14] if i do not see it do not let this wood
[1:42:17] ever the pattern of your heart
[1:42:18] isn't that right i speak in the name of
[1:42:20] the lord i believe with all my heart
[1:42:23] that the way it will wind up is a union
[1:42:26] a boycott all such places as this will
[1:42:28] be closed down and you'll not be able to
[1:42:30] speak unless you got permission or a
[1:42:32] license from this federation of churches
[1:42:34] the holy service god bless you let us
[1:42:37] all stand and give god some praises
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:40] amen and amen and amen praise the lord
