[8:18] the bowl and cover and reach there she's
[8:21] got a pop for me brushing god bless you
[8:23] good let's read a scripture I don't sit
[8:25] on no secret First Samuel chapter 16
[8:29] Leisha Peter says
[8:43] First Samuel chapter 16 Romans 8:28 and
[8:51] this is God speaking to Samuel Samuel
[8:55] and he told him to go to Jesse's house
[8:59] and from verse three go Jesse to the
[9:03] sacrifice and I will show thee what thou
[9:06] shalt do and thou shalt anoint me unto
[9:09] me who I named unto thee and Samuel did
[9:13] did that which the Lord spake and came
[9:16] to Bethlehem and elders with him tremble
[9:20] at his coming and said come as though
[9:21] peaceably and he said peacefully I am
[9:26] come to sacrifice unto the Lord
[9:28] Senta fire selves and come with me to
[9:30] sacrifice and he sent if I'd Jesse and
[9:34] his sons and he called them to sacrifice
[9:35] and it came to pass when they were come
[9:39] that he looked on Eliab and said surely
[9:42] the Lord anointed Lord's anointed is
[9:46] before him but the row said unto Samuel
[9:48] look not on his countenance or on his
[9:52] height of his stature because I have
[9:55] refused him for the Lord seeth not as a
[9:58] man saith for man looketh on the outward
[10:00] appearance but the Lord looketh on the
[10:03] heart then Jesse called a B'nai there
[10:07] and made him pass before Samuel and he
[10:09] said neither ere the Lord chosen this
[10:11] then Jesse made shamah to pass by and he
[10:14] said neither hath the Lord chosen this
[10:16] again Jesse made seven of his sons to
[10:19] pass before Samuel and sable said unto
[10:22] Jesse the Lord has not chosen these now
[10:26] what's the important question oops and
[10:28] Samuel said unto Jesse yeah all thy
[10:31] children and he said they remain at yet
[10:35] the youngest and behold he keepeth sheep
[10:40] oh my goodness it was a shepherd man he
[10:45] was a possibility
[10:47] come on out man lousy maternal a many he
[10:51] keepeth sheep and Samuel said unto Jesus
[10:54] and then fetch for him
[10:56] for we will not sit down all the time
[11:19] and he sent and brought him in I was
[11:22] ready and with all the beautiful
[11:24] countenance and goodly to look up to and
[11:26] the Lord said arise anointing for this
[11:29] is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[11:32] and anointed him in the muds of his
[11:35] brethren and the Spirit of the Lord came
[11:38] upon David from that day forward so
[11:41] Samuel rose up and went to Rama well
[11:44] excellent at smu top it says diverse it
[11:48] was juicy oversee press Romans 8 grow
[11:57] militia feet width verse 28 and we know
[12:06] that all things work together for good
[12:08] to them that love God to them who are
[12:10] called according to his purpose for whom
[12:13] he did foreknow he did predestinate to
[12:16] be conformed to the image of his son
[12:18] that he might be the firstborn among
[12:21] many brethren moreover whom he did
[12:23] predestinate them he also called and
[12:25] whom we called them he also justified
[12:27] and whom he justified them he also
[12:29] glorified
[12:30] what shall we then say to these things
[12:33] if God be for us who can be against us
[12:38] what demon what devil what what person
[12:41] can be against you in college for you
[12:44] sit sure nobody can be against you Kaman
[12:49] and that's what I feel tonight excuse
[12:51] you d'Alene first John room a little bit
[12:53] sweet then treat account here
[12:55] Metin only leave the in Elizabeth 3
[12:58] verse 1 2 3 what we see be all what men
[13:02] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[13:04] that we should be called the sons of God
[13:06] therefore the world know of us not
[13:09] because it knew in knots so the world
[13:12] don't know you Lamont nubuck or nappa
[13:14] you trying to mix you the world but do
[13:18] you belong human who you trying to get
[13:20] favor with the world says the world know
[13:25] you it says doesn't because this is the
[13:34] sons of God he says the world knoweth us
[13:37] not because it knew him not beloved now
[13:39] we are the sons of God and it doth not
[13:41] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[13:43] that when he shall appear we shall be
[13:46] like him for we shall see him as he is
[13:49] and every man that have this hope come
[13:52] just experience all that has this old
[13:54] man that has this hope in him purifies
[13:58] himself even as he is pure
[14:02] may the Lord and a blessing to the you
[14:07] may be seated amenities as well
[14:34] amen I mean I rolled up my sleeves did

[14:47] not roll up my sleeves brothers come on
[14:50] you a job you know when I climbed over
[14:53] the airplane put my foot on because you

[15:01] so I said I take every sport soccers
[15:04] under my control who is the son of God
[15:07] and I said Lord even the chief Cubana
[15:13] together with these small demons justice
[15:17] I take them under control so that super
[15:20] Sayan came here in the name of the Lord
[15:22] Jesus so I'm not ashamed tonight if I
[15:26] ought to sue for breach with authority
[15:28] pressure that you know if God is for you

[15:52] election is your protection
[15:54] what elección about protects you my
[15:56] subject now we are the sons of God son
[16:00] visited you and my inspiration if God be
[16:03] for us who can be against us oh god
[16:10] bless you - I feel the anointing already
[16:14] amen so just I'm gonna float a little
[16:18] bit on the quotes and I'm gonna I sort
[16:19] of got a three-prong message if I come
[16:21] and see you and I hope we'll be able to
[16:26] have enough time to go through it that's
[16:32] what the Bible says the earth is
[16:33] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[16:37] of the sons of God the world is waiting
[16:41] for the male love to come into their
[16:44] right and that means their domain or the
[16:49] position to make the position because
[16:52] Adam became unconscious who he was
[16:57] circulated and lost control and II lost
[17:02] Dominion but the Bible says Adam lost so
[17:16] it's so important to know who you are if
[17:21] you come to church convention in in
[17:25] conventional you can say you twenty
[17:28] years in the message message you soldier
[17:33] who you are then you must have a
[17:36] revelation when I'm the son of God and I
[17:41] have authority and you know my son when
[17:47] he comes to my home he doesn't ask dead
[17:50] he may post palaka never slice of bread
[17:52] that's cause why I'm also the play goes
[17:54] directly the Reverend on my shock he
[17:57] takes out a lock you see it was
[18:00] you come to me baby whoa baby became
[19:49] adopted was given Authority look because
[19:57] he stayed still in the process you know
[20:01] possible the process was given to him
[20:03] Donnie and then God said Jesus is my son
[20:07] so this my place
[20:14] [Applause]
[20:44] to the Father Jesus hallelujah my god
[21:29] this is the last meeting so somebody
[21:32] must take responsibility to tell the
[21:36] devil that enough is enough somebody's
[21:42] gonna do their brother and I'm saying
[21:44] tonight you can't have this people
[21:51] enough is enough they God's people Jesus
[21:57] died for them call them telling you
[22:04] enough is enough
[22:06] come to the end of 20 grand over to the
[22:10] New Year's promise
[22:34] for the new year with afraid of you
[22:53] coming into your position you see this
[23:10] weekend and Satan is afraid of that so
[23:26] don't pull back after the sweat so going
[23:33] back to the world forward through my
[23:43] adoption
[23:56] hallelujah praise God who is what use it
[24:00] is afraid of your manifestations sadism
[24:04] afraid because your position comes with
[24:07] authority and power a purpose to show
[24:10] fear when you know who you are
[24:14] traffic cop that policeman so police as
[24:20] soon as I don't know what but he has a
[24:23] uniform

[25:37] will flash like lightning the sons the
[25:43] name on the chick is just as good as the
[25:45] father if we check there's a major need
