[16:57] resting upon this blessed hope that we
[17:00] had we're trusting in the finished work

[17:46] which is the word of God the seeds to be
[17:48] planted upon this fertile ground to let
[17:50] us rest in this hope God I pray that you
[17:54] will touch every person tonight outside

[18:19] Lifeline the Grassroots Lord of all
[18:23] civilization we pray that the holy
[18:25] spirit will take each word and give it
[18:27] to the heart just as we have
[18:29] need may we Fellowship around the word
[18:33] far we ask it in Jesus name
[18:38] amen for a little reading of the
[18:41] scriptures tonight for just a a little
[18:45] text to try to hunt a context and be
[18:48] swiftly right to the word so we can have
[18:50] the communion tomorrow being Monday I
[18:54] know we don't like to think of those
[18:55] things of having to go back to work but
[18:58] we have to face that and many times you
[19:02] know but after all this is more
[19:05] essential in jobs and everything else or
[19:09] your job will play out someday and
[19:12] you'll play out with it but if you got
[19:15] eternal life you'll never have an end
[19:18] it's Eternal amen Liv on Perpetual think
[19:22] of it a Perpetual life has no end on
[19:27] aons of time has passed on by we'll
[19:30] still be there oh and the millions of
[19:33] years Roll by we still be there so just
[19:35] for a few days here on Earth jobs
[19:38] doesn't amount to so much just to help
[19:40] us along buy our little food and so
[19:42] forth eat which we have to have it now
[19:45] in First Corinthians the 10th chapter
[19:47] beginning with the 12th
[19:49] verse therefore let him that thanketh he
[19:53] stand take he lest he falls
[19:58] there has no temptation taken you but
[20:01] such is common to man but God is
[20:05] faithful who is not who who willing that
[20:10] you not to suffer you to be tempted
[20:13] above as which you're able but with
[20:17] every Temptation also make a way of
[20:20] Escape that we may be able to Bear it
[20:24] what a beautiful verse may the Lord at
[20:28] his Blessing blings to that making a way
[20:31] would be what I'd like to speak on
[20:34] tonight you know may add his Blessing to
[20:38] his word as we listen now to the
[20:42] word it's my
[20:44] opinion that if the word which is the
[20:47] Grassroots which is the thing that takes
[20:50] hold many times in my healing
[20:54] Services I I try to even after the
[20:57] teachers is already went through it all
[20:59] I try to come back and and take the word
[21:02] and lay a
[21:05] foundation a few nights ago I got a
[21:07] little letter of criticism which was
[21:09] fine a man told me he said brother
[21:12] brandom you're just a boy yet said I was
[21:15] preaching the gospel before you was born
[21:17] and he said I all my 46 years but yet he
[21:20] he was a teacher of some Bible school he
[21:24] said but a a man
[21:26] that of your
[21:29] kind that teaches people and yet would
[21:31] make a remark that you made the other
[21:33] night said I think it's ridiculous said
[21:36] you said that the devil didn't have no
[21:38] power to heal he said perhaps what if I
[21:41] tell you that the devil has got power to
[21:44] heal said now you'd ask me if you were
[21:47] standing present why I know said I'll
[21:49] tell you said in our town There's a
[21:53] woman lives there which has a a bad
[21:56] spirit and she people comes to her for
[21:59] healing says she'll pull hair out of
[22:01] their head and she'll pluck blood from
[22:04] their veins and wrap it up in his hair
[22:06] walk down to the river and cast this
[22:09] thing over her shoulder and not look
[22:11] back if she looks back said then the
[22:13] disease remains with the person but she
[22:15] has to throw to the river like his
[22:17] forgetfulness and walk away and said 60%
[22:20] of the people we kept count are healed
[22:22] so not if the devil can't heal what
[22:25] about that so I answered him I said my
[22:28] kind beloved brother with all due
[22:30] regards to your years see all due
[22:34] regards to your years of teaching but
[22:38] I'll tell you now that Jesus Christ said
[22:41] that the devil has no power to heal and
[22:44] if Jesus said it that settles it with me
[22:47] he said if Satan cast out Satan then his
[22:51] kingdoms divided and it has an
[22:54] end and he cannot cast out Satan and
[22:58] you'd ask me why was these people healed
[23:01] why it's not the person the witch had
[23:04] nothing to do with it no more than I'd
[23:06] have to do than any other man it's the
[23:08] people that's approaching thinking that
[23:10] they're coming God's provided Way for
[23:12] their healing it's their individual
[23:14] faith and God that does the healing see
[23:16] that's the approach that they think it
[23:18] isn't the witch or no more than it would
[23:21] be the man so therefore the gospel can
[23:26] only maneuver or it can can only reach
[23:29] out
[23:31] as the word of God is taught and man
[23:35] base their hopes upon God's Eternal
[23:39] Word Faith cometh by hearing hearing by
[23:44] the word amen Dr Ada here in the city my
[23:47] beloved friend said to me one day he
[23:49] said Billy don't you think if people had
[23:51] Faith to touch the tree out there you
[23:53] get the same results I said how could
[23:55] you have faith in
[23:57] that if you could have the equal amount
[24:00] of faith believing that it was God's
[24:02] provided way for you to touch the tree
[24:05] and it would do then they could do it
[24:07] but who's got faith in the tree I got
[24:09] faith in what God Said and I just take
[24:12] that so Faith isn't built up on the Shi
[24:14] and Sands of of emotional uh conceptions
[24:19] but faith is built upon the standard
[24:23] God's Eternal Word the Rock of Ages
[24:27] there's where Faith they
[24:29] solemn resting place and never moves
[24:31] amen when it's built right there
[24:34] now making a way I don't believe that
[24:39] God ever run his offices the haphazard
[24:42] way I I wouldn't run mine you wouldn't
[24:44] run
[24:45] yours Jesus didn't die at Calvary just
[24:48] to say well now maybe people feel sorry
[24:51] for me that I come go to Earth and take
[24:53] on the farm of Flesh and they'll really
[24:55] get saved maybe if they see how
[24:57] pitifully I die God didn't do that Jesus
[25:01] died for one purpose and that was to
[25:04] save those who God for knew would be
[25:07] saved that's right God knew there was
[25:10] going to be somebody saved and there had
[25:12] to be a preparation or a way made for
[25:15] them to be saved if there wasn't
[25:17] salvation wasn't possible so God for
[25:21] knowing that people would be saved
[25:24] knowing who they were he had to lay a
[25:26] plan down now you'd say to me brother
[25:28] Brandon then God knows exactly who will
[25:31] be saved correctly well why does he say
[25:33] he's not willing that any should perish
[25:35] he isn't he isn't willing that any
[25:38] should perish but that all might come to
[25:40] repentance but to order to be God he has
[25:43] to know who will do that or he wasn't
[25:45] God because he is he's omnipotent he's
[25:49] he's om apres he's om a mission he knows
[25:52] everything he's at ever placed and all
[25:54] powerful so four knowledge looks back
[25:57] and says that he foresaw this and know
[26:00] that's reason he could tell what the end
[26:02] was from the beginning and therefore
[26:05] knowing at all these marvelous days that
[26:08] we're living in now and to stand and
[26:12] witness and see the things that we see
[26:15] now God had to make a preparation for
[26:20] the other night was so amazed the little
[26:22] woman come up to the
[26:24] platform that big
[26:27] $300,000 PL
[26:28] there and she had a little makeup stuff
[26:33] on her face she stood there and she
[26:35] started
[26:36] trembling I said you're a Lutheran by
[26:39] the Holy Spirit she said yes sir and I
[26:41] said you're here to be prayed for and
[26:43] the reason you're walking way you are
[26:45] both knees have been broke I said that
[26:48] was caused by a car accident and a car
[26:50] that you were driving in 4 years ago she
[26:53] said that's true I said your doctor's a
[26:55] little Shar fell Baldhead and wears
[26:57] glasses said that's right now I said
[27:00] he's doctrin because that in the the
[27:03] knees the bone has become too berler and
[27:06] even the flesh is rotten around the bone
[27:09] she said that is
[27:12] right and she says is there a hope for
[27:16] me I said that depends on your approach
[27:19] to the Lord
[27:20] Jesus I said she said can you help me I
[27:24] said no
[27:25] man no one can help you now but you have
[27:28] to help yourself to God's provided
[27:30] blessings for you and she said I now
[27:34] believe with all my
[27:37] heart said the Lord heals you sister
[27:40] it's thus sayith the Lord you're healed
[27:43] she said Mr branom I haven't been able
[27:45] to kneel she said for 4 years while
[27:48] weeping standing there rubbing her hands
[27:51] the great audience of people weeping
[27:53] watching her Lutheran Presbyterians
[27:58] and I said why don't you go down to the
[28:01] Altar and kneel down she said let me
[28:03] kneel right
[28:04] here right where I'm Healed she never
[28:08] moved from her steps but she knew she
[28:10] was healed something took
[28:12] place she knew it there wasn't any
[28:14] guessing about it I said kneel down and
[28:18] for the first time four years with both
[28:20] knees broke and all calloused over made
[28:23] over the bones together that woman like
[28:26] a young woman knelt on her knees with
[28:29] the tears streaming from her cheeks
[28:31] raised up her hands to God or just
[28:34] raised right up from there just as easy
[28:36] like a little girl and tipped off the
[28:37] platform what was it God had to make a
[28:41] way for
[28:43] that now he sent doctors that's right
[28:46] and doctors are fine and they had done
[28:48] all they could do but God had made a
[28:52] away amen that's it after the doctor had
[28:55] failed in his way God's way is so much
[28:57] higher
[28:58] and our way what a wonderful thing now
[29:03] to think tonight that you and I W don't
[29:07] want to thank this but we were actually
[29:09] natured after the world say like
[29:12] pigs and tonight have become
[29:15] Saints something had to be
[29:18] done now we couldn't go into heaven as
[29:21] pigs we'd have to go into heaven as
[29:23] Saints so a preparation had to be made
[29:27] for this and God gave it so beautifully
[29:30] in the Old Testament back in the Book of
[29:32] Numbers about the 20th chapter and over
[29:35] Exodus about
[29:37] 3632 and we find out that on the day of
[29:41] atonement God in the types for showing
[29:46] what he would do in the anti type when
[29:49] it come which was Christ the high priest
[29:52] was commanded to take two goats little
[29:55] goats and take them in for Aon moment a
[29:58] offering and a bullock for his own
[30:00] family and many of you readers here and
[30:03] studiers of the Bible know just how that
[30:06] the atonements was but then one goat
[30:10] there had to be a lot
[30:12] cast and the lot fell on one goat it
[30:16] died and then the blood of this goat was
[30:20] placed upon the other goat with the
[30:23] hands of the high priest confessing the
[30:26] sins of the people
[30:28] upon the living
[30:30] goat and then a man who was worthy taken
[30:34] the living goat under his arm and went
[30:36] way into the
[30:39] Wilderness where the goat would have to
[30:41] perish and go into an isolated out of
[30:44] the way place never no more in that
[30:48] state to come back into the family of
[30:51] his own again but to be isolated
[30:55] forever bearing the sins of the people
[30:59] away now I know many scholars perhaps
[31:02] are sitting here and especially in the
[31:04] Adventist they they say that one goat
[31:07] was Christ and the other was the devil
[31:10] brethen I have to differ a little on
[31:12] that we can't sacrific to the devil both
[31:15] goats represented
[31:18] Christ both of them was Christ Christ is
[31:22] our he bled for our sins and he bore
[31:27] them his
[31:29] away amen devil can't bear my sins
[31:33] Christ is our sin
[31:36] barrier get it straight then your faith
[31:39] won't move Christ is our sin barrier and
[31:43] the sins of the world Christ was the
[31:46] dying animal at the cross listen the
[31:50] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[31:54] world Amen thank God and all only the
[31:58] types we were drawing dividends knowing
[32:01] that the end of type would come someday
[32:04] why was he slaying from the foundation
[32:05] of the world because God perceived in
[32:10] his mind how them things would be and
[32:12] what the church would be and what
[32:14] everything would be and he spoke the
[32:17] word amen and when God speaks the word
[32:20] it's as good as done right then so he
[32:23] was SL from the foundation of the world
[32:27] you see
[32:28] praise His holy name when you get down
[32:30] to that now I let your faith rest
[32:33] solemly not up on man not upon
[32:37] theologies of man not upon church
[32:39] denominations as good as they are as
[32:41] good as man is let your faith rest alone
[32:45] in Christ finished works at Cal for both
[32:48] sin and
[32:50] salvation you see it notice Christ came
[32:56] and he was the dying animal for he was
[32:59] already and prefigure slain before the
[33:03] foundation of the world you see it God
[33:06] spoke it and said it would be so so when
[33:09] God speaks it's forever confirmed in
[33:11] heaven amen the
[33:14] word the that's where you ought to have
[33:18] faith if you believe this to be God's
[33:21] Eternal
[33:23] interchangeable word than every precept
[33:27] that's spoken God's word is a seed amen
[33:31] and everything that God has spoke of in
[33:33] the word is already confirmed in glory
[33:37] god and it's been given to you to act
[33:40] upon so don't be afraid to take any
[33:44] phase of God's Eternal blessed work
[33:48] Hallelujah and anchor it in your
[33:51] heart now it has to be in
[33:55] soil now for instance I took a GRE a
[33:58] corn and put it in um blue pummy stone
[34:02] or something like that it perhaps would
[34:04] not grow because it's a wrong kind of
[34:09] soil but if it goes into good fertile
[34:12] black top soil it'll grow as sure as
[34:16] it's placed in there and when the
[34:20] word here it is now when the word of God
[34:24] falls into a Heart full of faith
[34:28] it just has to grow
[34:31] amen it's got to take hold that's the
[34:34] reason the woman standing there with
[34:36] both knees cast them over like that from
[34:39] the deposits and the breaking of the
[34:41] knees where both was mashed and the
[34:43] bones rotten with tu berler and the also
[34:47] the flesh she wasn't afraid to Bow her
[34:52] knees for what the word had fell in
[34:57] faith
[34:59] God Springs
[35:00] up you get it God before the foundation
[35:04] World said that Christ would be here and
[35:08] he slay die the innocent for the
[35:12] guilty and when God spoke it it was
[35:15] already confirmed when God spoke it now
[35:18] before it can be a word it has to be a
[35:20] thought for a word is a thought
[35:23] expressed and then if the god in his
[35:26] mind p receive these things then they
[35:30] were in his mind then he spoke them and
[35:34] they're as good as finish when God
[35:36] speaks C he's infallible amen and can do
[35:40] nothing else then God's attitude if God
[35:44] Saves Sinners back there on the base of
[35:48] accepting the burnt
[35:50] offering the sacrifice provided he's got
[35:53] to do the same thing today or he did
[35:56] wrong when he took the first man in amen
[35:59] if God heal the sick back there upon the
[36:02] bases of the shed blood of an
[36:06] animal upon the basis of the atonement
[36:10] he's got to do the same today or he was
[36:12] wrong when he heal the first person amen
[36:15] see he can't change we grow we mature we
[36:21] find better things we talk of better
[36:23] things we wear better clothes drive a
[36:25] better automobile we're progressing
[36:28] but God cannot progress in that way
[36:31] because he was perfect to begin with
[36:33] amen and Perfection cannot progress
[36:36] anymore amen it's already Perfection
[36:39] thank God Amen so he don't have to say
[36:42] well this is a different age we've got a
[36:44] better thought now if it is he can't be
[36:48] God so if he is God what he spoke back
[36:52] there he has to stay with it because he
[36:53] was perfect there and it's perfect now
[36:56] Hallelujah see GL for that you see it
[36:59] amen hallelujah and he can't progress he
[37:02] can't what I mean he can't EMB better
[37:04] things make this a little of say this
[37:06] would be a little better you say what
[37:07] about the old lamb and this lamb that
[37:10] was a type waiting for it and he said it
[37:13] was he spoke of the lamb slain the
[37:15] foundation of the world in the beginning
[37:18] I'll put imity against her seed and the
[37:21] serpent
[37:22] seed and then to wait till that fullness
[37:24] of time came God gave a propitiation of
[37:29] sin through the shed blood of the Lamb
[37:33] pointing he gave the same thing to the
[37:35] moon at night of the being the sun in
[37:38] the
[37:39] daytime the Moon being a shadow of the
[37:42] sun of the sun shining on the moon
[37:44] making a
[37:46] shadow the moon and the sun is husband
[37:49] and
[37:50] wife and while the sun is gone away it
[37:54] throws this light against the moon to
[37:56] give us a smaller right until the sun
[37:59] comes and when the sun come the moon
[38:00] Fades out amen
[38:04] Christ is the sun who's gone to glory
[38:08] and shining on the church with the same
[38:10] kind of light he shined when he was here
[38:12] and the church is the light of the world
[38:14] until Jesus comes and it all melts
[38:16] together praise God like the Moonlight
[38:19] the sunlight becomes one light when it
[38:21] emerges together when Christ and his
[38:23] church comes together at the great
[38:25] Millennium they emerge into one
[38:28] amen and today ye are the light of
[38:32] the and his presence and his absence
[38:35] rather he is giving you the light to
[38:38] shine with while he's here all the old
[38:40] things all the things of the Earth are a
[38:42] type of the
[38:43] Heavenly even to spiders and lizards and
[38:47] snakes and so forth are only types of
[38:50] evil spirit reflecting
[38:54] back why was a cancer called cancer
[38:57] because it has the form of a crab and
[39:00] the word cancer means crab now you see
[39:03] all those things which are types and
[39:06] shadows so the
[39:09] scapegoat that was put away Into the
[39:11] Wilderness in an isolated Place
[39:15] separated PR his fell
[39:20] citizens bearing the sins of the people
[39:23] upon his head was a type of
[39:25] Christ being SE separated from God and
[39:28] out of his presence and bore our sins to
[39:31] hell and there God wouldn't suffering
[39:35] David said I'll not suffer my Holy One
[39:36] seek corruption neither will I leave his
[39:39] soul in hell and on the third day rose
[39:41] again for our justification
[39:44] amen but he tiped the goat the scapegoat
[39:48] and also the goat for the sin offering
[39:51] god making preparations and a provided
[39:54] way God always makes a way of ES C every
[39:59] time sickness pin you into the corner

[40:57] Escape every
[40:58] time for he

[41:05] notice before the destruction of the
[41:08] world when man were sinful and the
[41:11] people were sinful in the world God made
[41:15] a way of Escape for those who desired to
[41:18] escape by
[41:19] it God had an ark built PR prepared Noah
[41:24] buil away on an ark for the prepar ing
[41:27] this Ark for a preparation of way
[41:32] listen from a far away of
[41:37] Escape has a wrath and the Judgment of
[41:41] God was piling up in the Heavens to be
[41:44] poured out upon a sinful nation and a
[41:47] sinful people who rejected and stiff
[41:50] neck walked against the Commandments of
[41:52] God all the time this wrath was being
[41:54] piled up in the Heavens to be poured out
[41:56] upon the the people in judgment amen the
[41:59] merciful god made a way of Escape for
[42:02] those who desire to walk in it
[42:06] amen the way of

[43:11] theologies if taking the Commandments of
[43:14] God and making them an non effect by
[43:16] teaching their traditions of man loving
[43:20] the Praises of man more than the Praises
[43:23] of God our teachers have become lukewarm
[43:26] and placing up on joining church and
[43:28] saying that's all right long as you
[43:31] belong to church just forget about it
[43:34] but brother God made a way of
[43:38] escape and you'll have to come to God's
[43:41] terms and that's through Christ Jesus

[46:16] proration and shut the grave and when
[46:19] the sun had convulsions and hung by cter
[46:22] and turned into Blackness when the moon
[46:24] and stars shuck out of their places

[46:46] the Supreme price and when the lamb died
[46:49] and the sins placed upon him he was a
[46:52] sin barrier Tu him to hell where they
[46:54] belong and God raised him up on the
[46:56] third day and by believing that we're

[47:01] shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:03] hallelujah amen God making a way of
[47:06] Escape oh brother as you see the hear
[47:11] the am
[47:13] screaming every time you hear one it's a
[47:16] marker that you're going that way every
[47:20] time you pass a graveyard it's a marker
[47:24] you're going that way every time a
[47:27] wrinkle appears in the face and a gray
[47:29] hair in the head it's a marker you're
[47:31] going that way no wonder than Paul could
[47:34] say with that real hope rooted in ground
[47:37] him in like this H when he got down to
[47:40] the end of the road he said i p a good
[47:42] fight I'll finish the course I've kept
[47:43] the faith henceforth there's a for me a
[47:46] crown of righteous the Lord the
[47:48] righteous judge will give me it that day
[47:50] not only me but all that love his
[47:52] appearing amen when you're sick and
[47:55] tired of this whole life

[48:04] children Hallelujah and there's a crown
[48:08] laid up for you not a crown of Gold
[48:11] Crown to put up on your head but a body

[48:25] at the Lord the righteous will give you
[48:27] at that day amen that's the day we look
[48:29] forward
[48:30] to God has made a way of Escape for
[48:34] everyone of us certainly he has when
[48:37] Daniel the Prophet God's child was throw
[48:40] into a lion's
[48:43] den there was the time that Daniel being
[48:46] faithful who raised his windows and
[48:48] wasn't afraid of what the king
[48:50] said and when they prayed regardless of
[48:53] what the Proclamation was
[48:55] made Daniel Prayed anyhow as he faced
[48:58] Jerusalem and prayed if man faced
[49:01] Jerusalem and prayed the city where the
[49:04] burnt sacrifices made that's the reason
[49:06] Daniel looked that way and prayed for
[49:08] the Lord had already said the people be
[49:11] in trouble at any time and look towards
[49:13] this holy place and pray then here I'll
[49:15] hear from heaven when Solomon dedicated
[49:18] the temple that's the reason Jonah had
[49:20] the faith he did when had seaweeds
[49:22] wrapped around his neck and standing in
[49:24] vomit in a belly of the way away down
[49:26] down in the Deep of the ocean on a
[49:28] stormmy
[49:29] sea he said there are lying
[49:32] vanities but once more will I look to
[49:35] your Holy Temple
[49:37] God God did
[49:40] something he made a way of Escape for
[49:43] Jonah what he did nobody knows that's
[49:46] God's own
[49:48] secret but no matter where it was
[49:51] impossible God can can alter
[49:55] circumstances
[49:57] amen he can make the impossible become a
[50:01] profitable not only profitable but can
[50:03] make it a reality when man take God at
[50:06] his word and accept by way that God
[50:09] provided for the
[50:10] man God did something he might have put
[50:13] an oxygen tit down there I don't know
[50:15] what he did in the belly of that whale
[50:18] but he kept joning in there for three
[50:19] days and nights as a t that Christ would
[50:22] lay without oxygen in the belly of the
[50:25] earth and on the third day he'll come
[50:26] out
[50:27] again was a type he made a way of Escape
[50:32] he always will when Daniel stood there
[50:35] and the lion coming running to him there
[50:37] was not a fear in that old Saint's heart
[50:40] but he stood there and God wasn't
[50:42] finished with him and just before the
[50:44] Lions grabbed him an angel spread before
[50:47] them no doubt but a same burning light
[50:51] that appeared to Saul of Tarsus on the
[50:53] road to
[50:54] Damascus a big light shined out
[50:57] and they looked and they didn't know
[50:59] what was taking place and Saul fell from
[51:01] his
[51:02] heart and a voice came from the light
[51:05] say Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[51:09] said who is it Lord he said ah Jesus
[51:11] you're
[51:12] persecuting it was the Hebrew children
[51:14] that had been faithful to the promise of
[51:16] God that was laying down there in the
[51:18] fiery furnace or in Babylon rather going
[51:21] to the Fier
[51:22] furnace One Step between them and death
[51:27] how much that may be to man here tonight
[51:31] there may be one day between you and
[51:33] eternal separation you'll make your
[51:36] decision
[51:37] now the Way's provided for you if you'll
[51:40] accept it one step said Jonathan to
[51:44] David when they shot the the the
[51:47] Bowl One Step between me and death One
[51:51] Step between them and death but just at
[51:53] that crucial moment Hall God provided a
[51:57] way of escape and he sent into that
[51:59] fiery furnace the Lord Jesus Christ and
[52:03] kept the fire off of
[52:05] them he was Enoch who claimed that he
[52:09] walked with God for 500 years and had a
[52:11] testimony he please God he had a faith
[52:15] that he wouldn't see
[52:17] death how could God do
[52:20] it there wasn't even a jet praying in
[52:23] those days to get him off his
[52:25] feet but God provided way a translation
[52:29] that took in out from Earth the glory
[52:32] that's receding death amen thank God it
[52:35] was Elijah who stepped across the old of
[52:37] the Jordan River that day but dividing
[52:39] from one side to the other praise the
[52:41] Lord why when Elijah was ready to go to
[52:43] heaven without
[52:45] dying hey it was God provided a way for
[52:49] him Hallelujah not a jet plane but he
[52:52] sent a chair of fire my heart as a fire
[52:55] huj god provided the way in the minute a
[53:00] way of escaped from Death it was Moses I
[53:03] believe who followed the children of
[53:05] Israel who led them following the light
[53:08] the pillar of fire through the
[53:09] Wilderness it was Moses who endured to
[53:12] the end his boses 120 years after 80
[53:16] years of service for God who stood up on
[53:19] the mountain and looked over into the
[53:21] promised land with the tears rolling
[53:22] down his cheeks of an old man 120 years
[53:25] old
[53:26] he'd come through the Bri patches he'd
[53:29] waited the Deep Waters he tasted the
[53:31] bitter cup of G and sorrow he'd been
[53:34] with the disobedient PE people as their
[53:36] Pastor he led them from place to place
[53:39] and put up with their Merm and throw
[53:40] himself in the breach and said God take
[53:42] me before you do the H was Moses who
[53:45] stood there as an old man knowing that
[53:50] every way he was a type of Christ
[53:53] knowing somehow some way God Sur would
[53:56] take him because he had to bring him up
[53:58] again as the type of Christ he was born
[54:02] as a prophet as Christ not only a
[54:05] prophet but leader and so forth he was
[54:08] HD away the bull rushes and so was
[54:10] Christ taken into Egypt he was the law
[54:12] Giver as Christ was from the Mount of
[54:14] olive him from son every way he was a
[54:17] type of Christ and when he was old and
[54:19] death T in the face how would he ever
[54:23] bring forth the resurrection but just as
[54:25] a Cru moment come God provided a way
[54:29] when the breath was leaving and gurgling
[54:31] in his neck he looked Lan by his side
[54:33] and there stood The
[54:35] Rock God provided a Rock The Rock was
[54:39] Christ Jesus who is in the wild amen
[54:41] Moses endur to the Rock God give me
[54:44] Grace to endure to the same thing and
[54:46] when my life breath is being drawn from
[54:48] this body let me see the Rocks standing
[54:51] there stepped over on the Rock and the
[54:54] angels come and packed him away 800
[54:57] years later he was standing in
[54:59] Palestine with
[55:02] Elijah standing there talking to Jesus
[55:04] before the cross God made a way of
[55:08] escape two of the greatest things in the
[55:10] Old Testament that I can see in the
[55:13] prophecies two great factions was this
[55:16] the people look forward to a time that
[55:19] when the Messiah would come and then if
[55:22] the Messiah come they look forward to a
[55:24] time that the Holy Spirit Spirit would
[55:26] come finally in due time all the types
[55:29] back there that they had through the
[55:31] prophets and everything all the types in
[55:33] the atonements they had finally Messiah
[55:36] come and it was settled because God had
[55:38] said so then they look forward to a time
[55:41] to a great glorious church that would be
[55:44] without spot or wrinkle that would shine
[55:46] in the Earth as a star they look for
[55:49] that time how's it going to be he've
[55:52] been dead for three days and nights he
[55:56] rose again he appeared in the 500 and
[55:59] then he ascended into heaven he left him
[56:02] on Earth here alone how could it be this
[56:04] glorious church when the leader was gone
[56:07] God promised the
[56:09] church how could it be the light that
[56:11] would shine in this place after him
[56:13] being gone when he said there a little
[56:16] while and the world sees me no more yet
[56:18] you will see me for I'll be with you
[56:20] even in you to the end of the world the
[56:22] things that I do shall you also go ye
[56:24] into all the world and preach the gospel
[56:26] these signs shall follow them and
[56:28] believe how can they do it with Christ
[56:31] absent from them how can they do it when
[56:35] God given the promise look God provided
[56:38] a Pentecost when the Holy Ghost in
[56:41] person came down and Tu over mortal
[56:43] man's body after they been cleaned by
[56:45] the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:48] and the Holy Ghost took that person into
[56:50] his own control and sent him forth with
[56:53] signs and wonders and miracles are
[56:55] fallowing amen
[56:57] God provided a way they couldn't do it
[56:59] in themselves they were man like you and
[57:01] I how could they do it they couldn't but
[57:04] God provided a way of Escape when they
[57:07] were in the upper room they thought the
[57:09] people would make fun of them they
[57:10] thought they'd be this side other they
[57:11] had the windows all closed and the doors
[57:13] locked how could they do it they were
[57:16] cowards they had no backbone they had a
[57:18] chicken wishbone and not a real Holy
[57:22] Ghost backbone they had the doors locked
[57:24] they was afraid they was ashamed to walk
[57:27] out and face the public how could they
[57:29] do it but God sent a Pentecost the
[57:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost they form the
[57:34] windows and doors open and in the
[57:35] streets he
[57:37] went God promised it when God promises
[57:41] God will keep his word he'll make a way
[57:44] of Escape he'll never suffer you to be
[57:47] tempted above anything that he won't
[57:48] make a way of Escape for you feel good
