tonight those un needy children and even those connected live and those who will hear the message be with us bless your word we pray in Jesus name I ask it amen amen God bless you one scripture Matthew 9 we want to read verse 16 and 17 of Matthew chapter 9 Jesus speaks welcome tonight no man putteth a piece of new cloth onto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up take it from the Garment and the rent is made worse neither do men put new wine into Old bottles else the bottles break and the wine run it out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and B A preserve may God bless his word you may be seated praise God well Sunday message but Anthony blow my mind it was one of the greatest message that was delivered and I want to believe not that it is odd but you know those who watch the weather wouldn't plan you know scripture concerning that and amidst all your tests and trials a message come for you to worship and to praise God and and this this is drawing to add put a Le on top of that but it's one of the greatest mess I've heard for a long time praise God presented here and to some it may look light talk about worship and praising God but it have a lot of depth to it more than you might imagine because for things to take place the atmosphere have to be created and you were built to be a Creator praise God that all we have here was always here since in Genesis all the planes the cars everything was here already you know it's just it wasn't discovered then it is discovered now but it was there for man to put the hand to it and make something out of it and it's so too we like standing here tonight as God's spiritual stist could mix things together and create something that that that different all together so it was so great it was wonderful I was really blessed with it so I have a title to to tonight you put new wine into new bottles inspiration Revelation then manifestation there must be a revelation first and that's what Jesus did he said who do men say I am and then Peter stepped forward and said thou are the Christ and then he said Flesh and Blood have not reveal it to you but my father and people don't catch how much they need Revelation and how Revelation come by the spirit now if you're not in the spirit no Revelation could break through because you are have you have a shield over you a shield of your own mind a Sho of your own weakness and faults and failures and sins and fears or whatever it is a shield over you but when you come to church and you begin to worship when there is no reason to worship or there is no reason that you feel to worship you're not going by your feelings you leave your feelings out and you worship anyhow when you could worship the devil is confused because you're supposed to be frustrated you're supposed to be depressed you're supposed to be giving up you're supposed to be letting go you're supp supposed to be almost committing suicide but yet you come and praise God at midnight Paul begin to sing at midnight Paul begin to worship Hallelujah there is a bad time to worship but that that's that's a human mind but to Paul that's the time to worship when things are tough when things are rough when you can't pay your bills when the When when when when when when when your creditors is coming in on you praise God when the devil gave it this trial and this thing happened and that thing happen and this test and that test and they say hallelujah anyhow praise God anyhow the Lord Give the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord praise God the devil can't take my joy praise God the devil can't take my praise I have my praise shoes on oh give the Lord I have my praise jacket on I have my praise dress on praise God and going pray socks on oh glory to God that's some in primary school they say rock your socks two different color socks and so come D to rock your socks when we come to rock our praise tonight come on come on I want to challenge to rock your praise praise and the children like it you know two different color socks walking on the road no problem with that long time you laugh at that you say have the wrong thing you're not matching but we have the rocky socks we rocking praise anyhow Devil's a liar tonight you know he thought he had us but we escape him we are part of the Escape Bunch we es we escape Rome praise God we escape the Catholic Church the Baptist Church the Methodist Church we escape religion we escape them religious spirit in the message we escape them for anointed one glory to God we escape them six seal preachers praise God we escape them who they want to talk about seven tenders we escape them too oh give the Lord a shout glory to God we escape the nomination Hallelujah we escape the harot The Prostitute and her daughters we escape all of that oh glory to God we are the Escape one oh glory to God we escape Oh Glory to God all what's coming on the world praise God we have a Escape Hatchet oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah right now America pray preparing some B2 bmers way down somewhere in the Indian Ocean who they going un bum God knows but praise God while the same peace in the side peace between Russia and Ukraine is war to the hoties when they say peace and safety sudden destruction shall come but when you share sh wars and rumors of wars the end is not yet because the preachers that come on yet oh give the Lord some Praises you hear that when you hear about wars and rumors of wars the end is not yet don't be fearful if your heart troubling you when you reading papers stop reading papers stop listening to the news it going trouble you more more trouble coming I have no time with that right now I want my heart to be full of faith I want my heart to be full of expectation I don't want to look at the weather to plant or look at the weather to reap oh give the Lord some Praises we doing everything by faith tonight we come to praise God by faith tonight we understand new wine coming it shall come to pass afterwards I'll pour out my spirit and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and I pour Oh Glory to God rain latter rain and I pour the wine and the oil oh give the Lord a shout tonight and wine and oil is connected in worship oh give the Lord a praise how could you have Holy Ghost and no Revelation how you can have Revelation and no Holy Ghost it connected together in worship once you have oil you have to have wine next to the oil oh give the Lord some Praises tonight oh we here to give God shout tonight you know Hallelujah brother brandom let's go so the Bible has told us you can't put new wine in Old bottles that one stumbled me I couldn't understand a bottle as I know we in America Glass of feir but in the orient I learned a bottle in the Bible was not a glass bottle it was a bottle made of animal skin I know you know it you hear it but may God reveal it and they take because if it's and dry you just dry and die might blow up you know all right so we talking to you tonight so the the bottle was animal skin they taking the skin from the animal tanned it as long as the oil from the animal skin was in the skin is flexible so when the skin gets old and set and dry it isn't flexible anymore that's like somebody in a message they're so long in it they old they're set and they're dry so watch this skin becomes dry and set and it won't give anymore so to put new here we go unfermented wine that's got life in it into a skin like that wouldn't be wisdom when the wine begins to ferment and to stretch the skin bursts and you lose both bottle and wine so there's a revelation inside of De you cannot put new wine into Old bottles you have to have oil in them bottles you have to be able to stretch to praise to worship to stand up to sit down if people call this the exercise in church that is the business we have nothing to do with that we will Cate our hands we put it down you might even lose weight with this thing oh give the Lord some Praises you might get in shape with this kind of thing but we here to worship because we go to Revelation 5 and see when the lamb took the book what happened to them oh give the Lord some praises and I'm going to ask it tonight if you going to join Revelation 5 or you going to stay in Trinidad and be in the message oh give the Lord some Praises PR we are staying in Trinidad and be to no message we want to be in Revelation 5 when you're in reation 5 you're in the word oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah so when the rhy begin to ferment you have to stretch with it you have to move with it you can't sit down stiff and like if somebody viting you they can see like you're angry and you're vexed stay home with that foolishness if you come here you come here to lift your hands you come here to worship they come there to Free Yourself praise God them them had two days of Carnival and they play their mask and raise their hand and they wi and carry on them done with that already but we continuing we continuing our thing because our God is willing to be praised he took the book and lose your name that's why you are here if you see your name you're going to shout if you see your name you're going to praise God you can never see your name and remain dead oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah and before you get into a manifestation they cut have a revelation Revelation is first but continues Jesus said in another place you cast not your P before swing you lose your pearse so you take a church that is so set in its way let be Baptist Pentecostal or message whatever it is it's so set when a new wine comes in and the wine comes by the word and the new word say the days of Miracles are here again that old dry up skin will then when that new wine begin to take a hole it can't move because it's set in what it believes it won't move and the skin burst open and pop open brother Bram he said I don't believe in miracles there you are when the Holy Spirit begin to say that Jesus Christ say yesterday forever and that Falls in an old dry Church hide you know what happens they just blow up if you say the baptism of the Holy Spirit was promis on the day of Pentecost to you and to your children and to them that are far off even as call them old dry skin just burst open and you lose your sermon now they say holy ghost without sensation what you see in his soul Hallelujah good thing Peter take that from them good thing Peter R your and say see his soul I didn't know know I didn't know know fire so but say fire fire fall on me it had to fall on you it has to be more than a song as the day fire fall on me we don't talk about that you know that's a special you singing that it can't be a special song you know it has to fire to fall on [Applause] you go the bus pass your GC CXC your degree your doctorate whatever you have go the bus pass all of that and fire bom you and when Fire Bomb you so that snake get burnning inside of you Hallelujah explosion inside your being then you walk a new man a new walk a new talk a new attitude a new vision a new you a new heart a new spirit his Spirit hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said new wine is to put into new bottles that's come from and the new skin has oil in it and it is flexible and when the Holy Spirit comes and say the baptism of the holy spirit is the same today as it ever was Divine Healing is the same as It Ever Was that new wine begin to spread out and and the skin gives with it so you have to be flexible Amen brother that's the word that's my word you see you bypass your theophany you bypass the expression of the word you come from thought to flesh so you don't know who you are you come to the word that the word could get you a Consciousness an awareness of who you are so you want to say Amen when you hearing the word preach that's you we talking about if the devil tell you otherwi that the devil is lying to you oh give the Lord a shout every time he open his mouth he's lying to you we come to bring you the word not your feeling we come to bring your psychology we we come to bring you that we come to bring the word the word to your flesh the word to your spirit the word to your soul Give the Lord a shout Moses didn't come to pharaoh and have a debate of pharaoh how long had the people oh God you sorry for them how long you have them your father father

and he so he want look the ex let um excuse me come back tomorrow right now I a feel let my people goish that that that is a man who have no Revelation but when God come now and reveal himself to Moses fire when God finished with him he knew the Living God he only had one question to ask God who should I say send me because you know them people have big mouth they want to know by what Authority because anytime God sent a man he sent him with authority he sent him with faith he sent him with ambition and he sent him with power oh give the Lord a shout in the house I get excited now praise God when Moses went down to Egypt he knew he come to take over not with the Army not with all the support around him Minister Association of Brethren not just the word hallelujah he knew he come to ruffle Egypt and Egypt was the superpower in that day with the B2 bmers even EG was the superpower of that day with all the technology and all what they had the AI and what they had but he was coming God was coming to bust them break them that every country will know who is God oh get the Lord I sh that's why God raised up Egypt to bust them and to break them and God raised up people and they position high and mighty now but God going to bust them and break them and the lowly God going to raise up I am telling you God going to raise you up give the Lord a shout hallelujah he that exalt himself shall be brought down low he that humble himself shall be raised up God going to raise you up let them laugh let them criticize but we're going to shut them out of the critics because rain is on its way oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hurt not the oil and the wine rain is on its way Hallelujah brother brandham my God my God I catch them tonight I see it tonight but a punch I see it tonight but a punch all them churches without Revelation they have no shouts in it they can't have no praise in it they have no wine there all they have is text and word and press play but they don't have Revelation because Revelation brings simulation Oh Glory to God Revelation is more than just word Give the Lord a shout Revelation is whne Oh Glory to God Revelation actually stimulates you how you could get Revelation yet still dead impossible impossibly imp Hallelujah brother Bram when the Holy Spirit come down and said the Holy Ghost is the same day and so on every time the word of God is preaching his power this new SK will holler amen not not do so going a signal handling traffic or what you traffic officer is that four beast 24 Elders cast The Crown John say all in heaven you talk about noise no noise no God wherever God is there is noise hallah you want to tell me deadness wait what what is that I rais up for that you know are fighting 17 years old to stay alive and keep alive and make sure you stay alive and keep alive I'm going to fight your deadness I'm going to fight your formality I'm going to fight your no testimony I go fight your dryness praise God until they get oil in them bones of yours oil in them skin of yours until your face start to move on all praise God praise God praise God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus M so when the word is preached the new will H amen it will give away you see the wisdom in a new bottle for new wine on the day of Pentecost there was 120 new skins laying on the floor now you find out the old skins was outside but when God came from heaven and filled these new skins they got new life and begin to bounce all over the floor even bounce out the door and Through the Windows into the streets new skin new skins with new bottles new wine he said holy ghost wine they a no mysterious wine you know they know trumpets and vials and Wes and and your head full like you're pushing a FR you know this is not that kind of wine you know this is Holy Ghost wine oh give the Lord some Praises he pour it out full of life just stretching and giving Oh Brother John I don't care what denomination belong to I love you anyhow there you are I don't care whether oness two n Three N finess we are brothers that's the new skin the new skin say we are brothers the old skin say I can't shake your hand brother shake your hand but you we can't fell we don't believe the same thing that's a old skin you know that's a dried up skin you know but skin with all that's my brother he B up he twist up like my brother they ask brother why do you go among them people he said hoping someday knowledge to know what they believe and it's in their heart Temperance with them patience with them what what is he saying he said you know he's saying I have these virtues in me operating so that is why I could treat my brothers right oh give the Lord some Praises oh do you get it now so as we get closer to Christ we have to see Christ you're climbing up with Mysteries and histories and all kind of Revelations and what and you're acting like a real real Rascal like a Trin not so we re see TR TR everywhere you don't ask to see that this is what has lived out because we we born in this country it say we would see Jesus so when Jesus to oo out of TR then you start say Jesus on the inside working on the outside Hallelujah do you understand that enough of Christ that is start to ooze out now when you're looking when accustom being angry you have Temperance you have control when you get things that get you upset you have a different approach to it why because something is happening on the inside of you it's reflect on the outside isn't that right praise the name of the Lord praise God so you don't care what kind of what Church to belong to you treat them right and so on so how could give new God give new wine in an unsanctified life the wisdom of putting new wine in new Sanctified bottles isn't that right so you see why the seven tunders was rejected not because it come and it come from like it come a testimony from New York it's not that you know it's because it was old bottles and they couldn't receive new wine but that is for the bride that is not for everybody this 7th under revelation that came in Revelation 10 note what where it come from it come from the mighty angel that cried out and seven through the voices out so those voices was for to gather the bright together those voices were to give the bride fith those voices were to show the bride how to repair those voices was to do something and be become the bright Revival voices come inside of you and then you become a live voice something that already lived out is not that you're trying to manufacture something new that voice overcome in Paul age in irus age in m age in Columba age in Luther age Seven Ages the never the devil never defeat one of those voices every voice stood in every age and God going and put them seven voices inside of you you will be defeated you're a liar you cannot be defeated I will not be defeated no I won't oh give the Lord a shout God raise you up to conf fuffle the enemy to blow his mind out glory to God we were all born in sin but we do have to remain in sin we was all shape iniquity but we do have to stay in iniquity we all come speaking lies but we're not going to continue speaking Lies We are called for transformation Oh Glory to God you come for inner Revolution that's what God call you for amen amen you are not just a son of your mother and your father you are a son of God oh give the Lord I shout your mother and father give you characteristics and colors and whatever it is and resemblance and so on but God have a gene thought that make you who you are Oh Glory to and this word come to address what you are on the inner inner man you are more than flesh and blood the Lord has shout you are more than just a flesh and blood [Applause] person this thing is so exciting to me the first man God made was a spirit man you may be seated he couldn't tell the man don't eat and all the tree eat he can't eat nothing he a spirit God is not a fool he's the fun of wisdom so what he going to tell that man he telling man on the original have dominion over everything Hallelujah rule them but when he formed man of the Dust of the earth he could talk about eating he could talk about King the soil and then he could pull out Eve because he ready for a further amen a further unfolding of his own life he named the woman a man with a womb because God made man original he call a woman a man with a womb Hallelujah and God had changed that that model he make he change that at all the same model oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah she shall be called woman because she was taken out a man God change that at all you say half woman and you turn into a man and the man turn the woman he talk that kind of talk let us make man in our image original oh give the Lord I shout let that man have dominion original Oh Glory to God you are still original oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah and he pull eveve out at Adam but he pull a bride out to Jesus Christ oh give the Lord look at me start here tonight to God don't get me start here tonight he pull Eve out of Adam he pull a bride out of Jesus Christ this prde will be manifested and she will not be like Eve you hear a shout in the house this bride will not be like Eve she'll be another [Applause] Masterpiece Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah devil confused tonight you know you making a whole a noise and a stressful today all right let's go reation chapter 5 I want to read 5 this is where I want to go tonight I saw in the right hand of him that son on the throne a book written within and the backside seal with Seven Seals note the backside wasn't written the backside was just sealed with Seven Seals but the book on the inside was written I saw a strong Angel proc who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth under the Earth was able to open the book even to look I wept much because no man was from worthy to open and to read the book you had to look there on one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the land of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seeds thereof and I beh held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the ell stood the lamb as had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth on the earth you hear that interpretation here having seven horns seven eyes which are seven spirits of God seven spirits of God Seven eyes seven horns take that hallelujah praise God and he came and took the book of the right hand him and set upon the throne Oh Glory to God and that's a closed chapter there all that was mechanics Hallelujah all that was Revelation the book written seal the backside now let's talk about some Dynamics when that happened chapter 9 verse 9 start a whole new thing so this book is really in two parts 1 to 8 and then nine straight down to 14 Hallelujah when he had taken the book The Four Beast 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them HS golden vials which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song let's take it from n then and they sung a new song what was the song don't what wory to take the book they talking about the feelings and the C the mortgage and the wife carrying on and this happening they was not talking about that they was talking about the lamb you see worship is not about you it's about who he is Give the Lord a shout notice worship is not about your emptiness and your Void and what you need to touch with and what you need to break through with worship has nothing to do with that worship have to do with who he is what he has done the song a new song thou was worthy to take the book and to open the seals therefore thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nations and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall not maybe not perhaps we shall reign on the earth to reain is to rule the rule is to conquer the conquer is to overcome oh give the Lord a shout to put your foot on the devil's neck Oh Glory to God to put your foot on the neck of that King give the Lord some Praises tonight that's what we call for that is what the word is talking about that is what the word is addressing Hallelujah and I beheld I heard the voice of many angels wrong about the throne and the beasts and the elders the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousand say with a quiet voice saying with a easy voice Ming just let the lips moving it just say that say with the Lord voice say loud L Oh Glory a loud voice they say Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and Glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such in the sea and all in them heard I saying blessing honor glory power unto him that sited upon the throne and un the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the 420 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever oh give the Lord some Praises what are we yet to do to worship him he is coming in power we don't need a be2 bumber hory to God we don't need nuclear weapon we have what it takes Give the Lord a shout we have what it takes glory to God God released what we need to have thank you Lord [Applause] jesuso [Applause] Glory what did we read the last time I preach he say never give his mystery Secret in full he is waiting for it to be made known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it now the coming of the Lord is a mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming after he already after he's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done never give his mystery in full then he say like comparing the Seven Seals when God used Martin Luther for the coming of that first St age he was used John Wesley he gradually brought him out and was revealing in them that church age so they were living out something unknown to them so it took a prophet after it's completed Here Comes brother Branham he standing at the end and looking back and said this happened here first age second age third age fourth age why it's already completed so he's showing you what what already has been done Oh Glory to God and then he come out to all this scattered word to tie back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was trapped or bound at river Euphrates by Creeds and dogmas because once you have Creeds and dogmas Holy Ghost can't move once you have interpretation Holy Ghost can't move when you have the Mystery Men preaching all kind of mysteries that God even sent Holy Ghost cannot move it has to be done unadulterated word that's the conduit of power oh give the Lord a shout the spirit could only move through the word Hallelujah an adoption oh my God is there is my spirit flowing freely no hindrance no self no parade of the beef no a man biging up himself or biging up his ministry that fishes that dead dead dead there is my spirit I find a empty vessel I find a Channel of communication that inspiration could flow through I find a man that I could use I could put hand on him I could find him I could take him I could break himall you see what what what did Brother Bram when he listened to the Pentecost and he didn't want to do what God tell him to do and he work hard he saving people he lost his wife he lost his child God has breaking him when he start to preach adoption he said he could turn your wife against you he could take a child he could do this he could do that to see what you will do the test is not them it's you so stop making excuse well well well stop pointing fingers and be a man and stand your ground stand like a man face it some people have no wife some people have no husband some people have no children some people have this and that and all kind of some people in wheelchair some people some people in hospital tonight where's your complaint like the man complaining he no shoes until he stop some no feet you still have foot shoes is still possible with you stop complaining too much come on question what does see thou hurt not the oil and wine mean in Revelation 66 it's the Holy Spirit we just got through that hurt not the oil and the wine now what does oil and wine mean the oil we took it symbol means holy spirit now wine and oil is connected together in Bible in worship am so they that worship Him must worship him in spirit and in truth it looked like we only had truth because if any church is not worshiping what they have and D message we could have a picture of a cloud and have a picture brother Brown see see I do have that here any man could just sck a picture and stick a picture message oh is that right the CL make message or picture you I'm saying in other words we have to ask God for divine what that word divine revelation Revelation that comes from Heaven not an understanding but Revelation Revelation is when he reveal it to you and that is why you have to fight to be in the spirit that's why you have to fight to worship but if the devil keep you away from the true worship you can't get in the spirit then there's no Revelation coming you're only hearing and it hit in your head you're only hearing and sometime you're roting in church you're hearing just word but when Revelation strike you it it make you jump off your seat it make you act you were getting just now what it does and we could examine churches you could you could look for yourself to see if that is happening if Revelation really striking or if the man bringing Mysteries and look at oo he's my man he's our man he's the main man in TR a clone Entertainer watch this wine stimulates wine is the antitype of its natural form stimulation is revelation just think what stimulates the church Revelation so wine new wine oil and wine went together in sacrifice went together in church worship notice they're connected together you got a concordance you look at up the whole string where wi and all is met together in worship so wine brings what stimulation shout out stimulation you know what stimulation is is get you back out of your Blues you're tired you low make a cup of coffee for sometimes you want make um this thing sour sour is good tea put to sleep but when you want to be on the Move coffee it's two different kind of stimulants so will send you straight to bed but coffee I I demon whatever coffeee it have something inside of that so she why why I going there I hope this no problems do you get it know so wine which is revelation bring stimulation was somebody in the Bible the prophet was out of the spirit he said bring me a Minal bring me somebody that could sing bring me somebody could change the atmosphere amen because in this atmosphere I can't hear from God I can't draw the anointing I can't get a breakthrough with this atmosphere it's negative take this serious tonight you know you can't encourage and have a negative atmosphere and expect God to break through that go and coming through that bring me a Minal what for to get in the spirit and when the man get in the spirit he said dig some ditches not a few whatever praise God give a word because a man get in the spirit when that demon fall upon Soul where they get they say find somebody could play good music where they get David in the Old Testament never cast on a devil but they could sue that Spirit a play that have so that Spirit take a leave the atmosphere the atmosphere Oh Glory to God just as the spirit atmosphere playing the H could run that demon it have music that could bring demons do you understand that now just as music could send music could bring to the kind of music that people playing because the people playing music that Inspire from Hell the devil giving them inspiration words and all cting to sing a set of stuff with the music behind it and that hits in the charts getting people in the atmosphere but I say we had to get in the atmosphere of the coming of the Lord oh my and before before the disciples get the Breakthrough they came into an atmosphere of worship that's what brother an was preaching he said he came and identify his objective from the very start he said my objective only God could give him that my objective this morning is for us to get a create atmosphere so that could just tell me what is coming next because once the atmosphere begin create a Dynamics about it Dynamics is on its way and Oh Glory to God you see America right now is in an atmosphere of dictatorship because America have to become not the land of the free and the brave that used to be it have to become the land of the dragon and the Beast so what you're seeing here is prophecy unfolding Hallelujah is unfolding right before your very eyes just now America be unrecognizable people don't want to go America people war in the country about going to America sure getting back out normal you understand what going on there that country was the land of the free and the brave brother Bram he said now if you put in Leviticus 8 12 time gr boy wow you talk about the oil Matthew 14 fullish version now oil this on the third SE oil tipify spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation boy I like to run all over the place people are running they sitting down in church and they say Revelation a non-stimulant revelation many many wrong Club listen it's a wonder I didn't wake up the whole neighborhood when the Lord showed me that stimulation of Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always then he said this when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his saints that is filled with oil they get stimulated wine is stimulation he say Glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy and shouts do you get it now when the truth is being revealed the Saints with oil begin to shout they begin to get happy and joy they're not studying their problems and their issues in life out there you know they are connecting with the truth that has been revealed hallelujah hallelujah let's go huh they get all stimulated wine is stimulation he said Glory I feel it right now stimulate with joy and shouts when it does here we go it has the same effect that wine have upon a natural man I don't know I don't know no names of no wine right now if I know to call it punch a gold corn I know what that is know that maybe he he to drink it I don't know but the point is this the same effect natural wine have upon man this wine have upon the believer because when they hit when it hit them in the upper room they were staggering Peter had to tell the people these people are not drunk as you suppose they looking drunk they walking drunk they're acting like they drunk but they're not drunk but this is that that the prophet Joel W off this is that kind of a wine oh give the Lord a shout in the house help me Jesus glory to God hallelujah did you get what I'm saying they looking drunk they acting drunk they stumbling like drunk men but they are not drunk this is new wine this is Joel wine this is Spirit Wine this is Holy Ghost wine this is seven Thunder wine Oh Glory to God this is bright Revival wine oh give the Lord some Praises you can't steal my joy tonight you can't change this wine thing tonight oh give the Lord some Praises in the house hallelujah hallelujah let's gooo listen it has the same effect of that wine upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil the Revelation reveal the stimulation become so great it makes him behave himself unnormal that's that that's that that not that not even a regular word but and normally means you ever see how sometimes BR back and you come in front and you want to know how we come in front it's not normal he's being stimulated he's so excited about it this have to stimulate you glory to God hallelujah you think we do have troubles you think he doesn't have troubles anybody shouting you think they don't have troubles and worries and issues they have it but they're not letting that stop them from enjoying this glorious word the Bible tell me you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that are Deads wondrously with you and my people shall not be ashamed oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah woo oh help me Jesus help me Jesus help me Jesus help me Lord Oh Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord thank you Lord [Applause] hallelujah I'm read here for you from Joel Joel 221 say fear not all land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid he beast of the field for the passes of the Wilderness do spring for the tree bear the fruit the F tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then not be sad then be glad then not be sad but be glad the people want you to be sad the devil want you to be sad sad and depressed frustrated and amen want to give up he said be glad be glad each children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given unto you the forign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month and here what going to happen and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil glory to God it shall overflow with wine and oil stimulation of Revelation with the Holy Ghost Give the Lord some praises and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the caner and the caterpillar and the pmer woman and the great AR shall sent among you and he shall eat in penty and be satisfied Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah satisfaction guaranteed woo glory to God hallelujah but B says when this Revelation reveal the stimulation become so great that it makes him behave unnormal he said Glory maybe that's what happened with them now it makes them behave themselves unseemly you say if you want scripture for this start reading Acts 2 they had a promise that has been given them and when all the promise of the Holy Spirit was poured on them it was scripturally Vindicated what did they say now wait uh he told us to wait of Heaven Ministry after 8 days he said well tell your boys Mark Matthew I believe we already got it fellows don't think so I believe we already got it m George they they got it to get but they said they got it they adopted already potential they they mark on papers what why are we waiting on our ministry when we ought to be out there preaching he told us us to come up here and wait and this is 8 days we have been here well let's wait another one 9 days come then Mark come around rest of them said John I believe you ought it any longer I believe you already got it don't you Min saying you know I believe we f up the road and we are know how far I want to know when I hear that so I get right now the we think you and me you meet be and lion and you facing gol I think I f up the roadl you you want I think I reach the road when go say send me a man when you see him so that f up the road make you further up the road the other way Direction because you care face go with your eye that eye alone will listen it's a jant talking about why think all those solders was just just Shing The Sword and Spear and not looking at G why you think they polishing the boots and they say me I talking ignoring them they have air muffs 40 days 40 nights after a few days they start to get them things the big things put in the ear and just keep shining shoes Army Lord's army Hallelujah when David come David was so anointed David was so stimulated David said who that uncircumcised Philistine the fin I'm living God FIS you know I'll cut his head off I Mee in him anywhere any time any place under any condition and David ran to meet him he wasn't afraid he was anointed he was commissioned and he was doing his thing that he was always doing with his sling and God directed his Stone and brother Ram said if we only get started God will do the rest stop being a coward get moving get started do the thing that God want you to do give the Lord some [Music] [Applause] Praises I can see Simon he had the keys now wait a minute boys the scripture says something about this he never told us how many days to wait he says stay there until Joel's prophecy come to pass Isaiah prophecy Vindicated for which Tam lips another tongue somebody watching Jesus I see Jesus I see Jesus stagger and I Tak my queue from Jesus you stay there don't stagger don't speak in tongues don't wait for power just keep watching Jesus I see brother this AB that my promise watch brother know I have no scripture to watch but know I have scripture to watch the prophecy because he came to prophesy to a bride so you of what he do how he live that has nothing to do with me is the words that came out his mouth that word will not return void oh give the Lord some Praises so Peter scripturally thought taught because he had his understanding is open he had his mind open the scripture open to him he said Brothers wait Isaiah prophecy had fulfilled yet you Stam your lips no we sit down and shut up what is wine in the Bible refreshment this is the refreshment that come from the presence of the Lord it's got to be scriptural now you see the wine represents stimulation of Revelation so when the Holy Ghost fell they seen the fire of God fall upon them that begin to stimulate them and the first thing you know they got so stimulated till the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by Revelation the Revelation had them acting like drunk men oh God it's too much it's too much for me like I go for L tonight oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that what we talking about the stimulation upon them take all the blues out of you tell all the negatives you know so so all that so that go you you become empowered just remember friends they were in the upper room with the door shut they have have open house and all the windows open they shut the door because they were afraid they shut the door because they were afraid Jesus was taken up you know they see him go up you know it have no jail protection you know that insurance coverage he had was no more in so they had to follow in obedience wait until the promise of the father Hallelujah got to wait for that now note when it strike them there was no CS no more you know they bust the door open but the but the Sab open the door and step forward Hallelujah so stimulated because the hour that they came out the the bars wasn't even open yet so that's why people had a problem with how how you be staggering so early what kind of liquor you have what booze you taking oh give the Lord some shouts Hallelujah too early to be looking so tight to be looking so high like a smoking some kind of gja or something so but they had something the L the valley they had a different kind of smokes Al together go give the Lord some Praises they had a different kind of head hallelujah hallelujah and this bride will PR be coming un stimulated you think we leaving here sad we leaving here shouting we even here praising God oh my my almost done here believe you me have 12 pages and now on page six oh how this thing working out now but the people thought they were actually drunk but they were stimulated by the Revelation God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them they were happy about it God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them here was a man standing there saying this is that this is it and there it was being Vindicated there is the stimulation of Revelation and it really had them and that's the reason Peter could go out there and said you men of Judea you the DW listen to me all you doctors of divinity listen to what I'm going to tell you how wonderful revealed they become so stimulated that they seen it Vindicated that it always does what it does let's continue when I see God promised to do a certain thing in this day when he promised to break off those seals in this last day and you don't know the joy the glory when I seen him reveal this and stand there and watch it happen and know that I will take any personal charge he never did say W thing that what that what happened that way and when we see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise for this day as he promised to do it and see Vindicated you hear me say I feel religious that is what the matter it stimulation is so bad so when the stimulation hit he I feel religious he stimulated he said I feel religious there something fine inside him Hallelujah glory to God it's stimulation from Revelation they became so stimulated over the Revelation they Vindicated the promise they broke out with joy of stimulation till the people said they are drunk with new wine when God revealed this promise to them not only did he reveal it but he proved it as I always said a man can say anything and that's say every pastor and minister in Trinidad they can say anything praise God but when God comes around and vindicate that that's a different thing Al together oh give the Lord a shout that man said this is that that the prophet will BR I'm siake of I'm not about no dream a dream last night and meet some Angel and some and some feather and some kind of foolishness I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a promise that God made that God come around and vindicate that that you can say this is that that the prophet William brandham oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so Revelation 5 1-7 is revelation the book and everything else and after that Revelation 8 to 14 is the worship the atmosphere isn't that right where I'm call it King lamb worship praise God Revelation first manifestation after it has always been that way Revelation first manifestation after isn't that right glory to God he call it that we are in the time of the revelation of these things being made known Hallelujah but they have to switch over some point in time to the manifestation of what has been revealed Oh Glory to God we have been living for 50 plus years in the time of the revelation of these things being made known because God wanted to reveal himself that was one of the object of God how to reveal himself clearly and his word was lost Through the Ages so the current couldn't flow down so like a plumber like a electrician he had the wire to connect from Paul irenius Columba he connect all the wires he tie up all the Loose Ends and he get a straight line and when he lights it up so it bring a charge oh give the Lord a shout how all them voices lined up oh glory to God would the bride have the voice of the archangel Oh Glory to God hallelujah when Jesus said Lazarus come forth Lazarus can say I ain't coming I ain't feeling head Lazarus had no answer to that you know he had to come forth and when that voice come in that bride whatever you say whatever you speak it will materialize just like that you talk about anointing coming in the church come on bride we have a lot to look forward for we have have we have to have great expectation glory to God Amen let me finish here hallu hallelujah M come up please the holy spirit always speaks the word he something to guide I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes note Jesus with them word made flesh coaching them speaking to them giving them promises and yet in it he's prophesying about Holy Ghost he's talking about the spirit of Truth he's talking about the guide and when he comes I'm limited what I could tell you but he's coming then he said this yeah he will guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals here we go at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up there which is up to brotherly kindness by that time into the full statue of Sons and Daughters of God because in the morning he preach a statue of perfect man this was a night service he preached the guide not at the beginning of the seventh seal at the finish of the seventh seal question where are we at beginning middling or finishing if we are to to get to the finishing we we should be way up there oh praise the name of the Lord praise God brother said this here each seal broken the word of God revealed to the man of the age I skip down he said it the eight to the 14th verse of the fifth chapter I'm reading reveals the time for the lamb to be worshiped both in Heaven and Earth yes the seven seal book The worthy lamb the Kinsman redemer from the eth verse so he separated it from the 8th verse to the 14th Angels worship Him Elders worship Him living creatures worship Him John worship him so much till he said every creat in heaven and in Earth under the Earth heard me saying blessing Glory power wisdom unto the lamb the worship time of the king lamb and worship comes before the Holy Ghost pours out oh glory to God praise God praise God as Daniel heard the seven tunders Ephesians CH and forbidden and John heard the voices and this book was sealed the mystery of God will be finished in other words God will be known to his church not in three persons but as one person the mystery of God would be revealed watch that would reveal now and when that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries would open to the church talking about seven Thunders are you with me now are you with me because India the church will be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive among us living among us then we are worshiping the living Christ that is Among Us that's a promise that's a promise seven tunders seven voices the church to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out not no man moving out not no man presenting himself as some great teacher or orator or mystery revealer not that foolishness and I call it foolishness because we come to see Jesus not a man not a Trinidad man oh give the Lord a shout not an American man not a European man or South American man or African man no man at all we have to see Jesus come back Among Us that is resurrection Faith same signs same wonders I'm closing Jesus was manifested he said to the Hebrew bride because you hold your Traditions you make the word of God nonone effect it can't be effective that's why today the Revival we had is theom denominational revivals no real stirring the bride prophecy hasn't had a Revival yet let a minister challenge that let them just identify where the bride had a Revival and where the people who was in that Revival where they going the bride has not a Revival yet there has been no Revival there no what no manifestation of God note not Revelation not Mysteries unfolding not four five hour sermon no manifestation of God to stir up right yet we are looking for it this church looking for it I am looking for it if you don't want to look for it I am looking for it it will take those seven unnown tunders to wake her up again and guess what he will send it he promised it amen hallelujah do you believe this word he will send it he promis it let me say again he will send it promise it if the churches would forget their Creeds forget their dogmas take the Bible and plead the promise it will become to effective to them how you plead the promise to pleas to beg to pleas is to make an emotional appeal to make an urgent emotional statement or request for something EX example he was on his knees pleading for Mercy to beg for something or beg someone to do something to beg to implore The Plea Oh Glory to God hallelujah God you promise a Revival God you promise your Holy Ghost you promise signs and wonders you promise a super Church you promise a super race I claim it I plead it Oh Glory to God I plead my own Revival oh a personal Revival glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you know have family pizza and personal Pizza when you have Family Pizza everybody all part of the family taking part of the pizza they have a personal pan that's yours you want your personal Pizza you want your liquor fire you don't want everybody fire you want your own when you leave here you have to have your own fire every one of them got a lick of fire they got their inheritance they got their portion oh give the Lord a shout Hallelujah you want your portion give me my Mountain my godall I'm done I'm going to close off here oh I have one hereo I close with this there was a um a boy was sick I think he was terribly sick I skip it down so I went across the other side of the bed knelt down just a simple prayer lay hands upon the boy I said Lord Jesus this father and mother has brought me here to pray pray for your son he is dying Only You Lord can help him I know that you said these signs shall follow you so we put inside there telling God that you know these sign believe if the lay hands on the sick they shall recover I plead that promise to you Lord Jesus for the sake of the boy's life no change come at all I said Thank You Lord the old father raised up and said Lord I'm so grateful to you ever grateful for healing my son and he reach around the mother and fell into his arms his mother he said dad think of it he's going to be well now yes I stood and looked and they were happy and rejoicing and weeping the boy was just low as he could be they said oh it's wonderful and the little nurse look around she look at me she said I believe you misunderstand the doctor's orders she said I believe you misunderstand the boy's dying oh the old man said no he's not dying he's going to live so she said look sir I appreciate anyone having faith like that but how can you laugh and go on like that and you see there's no difference in The Boy The Boy will die he can't live well we don't see how he has lived this long said it's never been known among sick people or science rather than a person ever went that low with a heartbeat like that some kind of cardiogram or something that ever come back again I'll never forget that old man he put his hands upon her shoulder just like a father to a daughter he said look my dear child that cardiogram is what you are looking at that's what you are trained to look at that's what all you know about is that cardiogram but I am looking at a Divine promise the boy is married and got three children now it depends upon what you look and I want to play that song Jesus pour in the oil and the wine play
