[32:16] and jeremiah speaking more of the word
[32:17] of the lord came to me saying go and cry
[32:19] to the age of jerusalem
[32:21] saying thus saith the lord i remember
[32:23] thee in the kindness of thy youth the
[32:25] love dinos puzzles when the winters
[32:27] after me in the wilderness in the land
[32:30] that was not sown
[32:32] israel was holiness unto the lord and
[32:34] the first fruit of his increase
[32:35] all that devour him shall offend the
[32:37] evil shall come upon them saith the lord
[32:40] hear the word of the lord o house of
[32:42] jacob and all the families of the house
[32:44] of israel
[32:44] thus saith the lord what iniquity
[32:48] have your fathers found in me that they
[32:51] are going far from me
[32:52] and i've walked after vanity and have
[32:55] become vain
[32:56] neither said they where is the lord that
[32:58] brought us out of the land of egypt
[33:01] that led us through the wilderness to a
[33:02] land of desert and of pits
[33:04] through a land of drought and shadow of
[33:06] death to a land
[33:08] that no man passed through where no man
[33:10] dwell
[33:11] and i brought you into a plentiful
[33:13] country to eat the fruit thereof and the
[33:15] goodness thereof and
[33:17] when you entered you defiled my land and
[33:19] made my
[33:20] heritage an abomination and the priest
[33:23] said not
[33:24] where is the lord and they that handle
[33:27] the lord knew me not the pastors
[33:29] also transgressed against me and the
[33:32] prophets prophesied by bear
[33:34] and walked after things that do not
[33:36] profit wherefore
[33:38] i would yet plead with you saith the
[33:40] lord and with your children's
[33:42] children will i plead for pass over the
[33:45] eyes of chittiman see
[33:47] send unto kida consider diligently and
[33:50] see if there be such a thing
[33:51] at a nation change their gods which are
[33:53] yet no gods
[33:54] but my people have changed their glory
[33:57] for
[33:58] that which dot not profit be astonished
[34:01] oems
[34:02] at this and be horribly afraid be very
[34:05] desolate say the lord
[34:06] for my people have committed two evils
[34:10] they have forsaken me the fountain of
[34:13] living waters
[34:14] and i've hewed them out systems
[34:18] broken systems that can hold no water
[34:22] or what a condition to be in after all
[34:24] these years
[34:25] and my spirit is still tonight because i
[34:30] i realize how far the church is from
[34:33] what god require and what god must have
[34:36] of us
[34:37] and we have to come up to line with
[34:39] god's requirement and god's program
[34:41] o pray is the name of the lord and i
[34:43] trust that all of you would have
[34:45] listened to the
[34:46] bible study we have was very important
[34:47] bible study about uh
[34:49] the will of god for you to be sanctified
[34:52] so if you have not listened to it
[34:53] please do amen but obama was praying
[34:58] and he was talking about men and on
[35:00] position and then he switched to the
[35:02] ministers
[35:04] and as my brethren standing this morning
[35:06] i prayed at each of these
[35:07] ministers in here these ministering
[35:10] spirits that god hear my prayer and i
[35:13] pray
[35:14] that you will purge that gift that's in
[35:17] them
[35:20] purge that gift
[35:24] that is in them if they are preachers
[35:26] make them better preachers
[35:28] if the evangelists make them better
[35:30] evangelists if their teachers make them
[35:32] better teachers
[35:33] if their pastors make them better
[35:35] pastors god grant
[35:36] that they'll be filled with the spirit
[35:38] of god and they'll be energized by the
[35:41] great
[35:41] supervine that will give them life
[35:44] eternal
[35:44] and power to minister with and to touch
[35:48] the needy world
[35:49] as it so needs today or give the lord
[35:52] some praises
[35:54] isn't that something he said forgive us
[35:57] of our shortcomings
[35:58] forgive us of our narrow-minded beliefs
[36:02] and little sectarian ideas and let us be
[36:04] baptized into one big brotherhood
[36:07] into one big fellowship that the kingdom
[36:09] of god might be
[36:10] furthered by our coming together this
[36:12] day we asking jesus what a prayer
[36:15] oh glory to god hallelujah
[36:18] thank you lord you love him tonight
[36:21] hallelujah
[36:22] and that's what the matter is if it's an
[36:24] order the church
[36:26] it's got the mechanics ready it only
[36:29] needs the dynamics tonight
[36:30] if we can get the mechanics ready get
[36:34] your hearts right here we go the things
[36:37] that we can do
[36:40] that's where i get that from get the
[36:42] mechanics ready
[36:43] our hearts right what is that the things
[36:48] that we can do then you say follow him
[36:50] in every word
[36:51] follow him baptism falling in every
[36:53] order he told us to do
[36:55] get every mechanic ready and stand there
[36:58] then we are ready for the dynamics to be
[37:00] lit off
[37:01] and only god can do that and that's to
[37:03] drop into our hearts
[37:05] the fate that says i am now healed
[37:08] oh give the lord some praises tonight so
[37:11] malachi 4
[37:12] the scripture we read he came to tie up
[37:15] the loose ends in the church
[37:17] isn't that right that we could get a
[37:19] message that we could be prepared and be
[37:20] ready
[37:21] for the coming of the lord isn't that
[37:22] right hallelujah
[37:24] and god in the loose ends was to release
[37:26] what the power back in the church
[37:28] because god could only use the conduit
[37:30] of his word
[37:31] and because the word was scattered
[37:33] through seven ages he then seven ages
[37:35] from eternity
[37:36] to gather all that scattered word and
[37:38] bring it back and tie back into the word
[37:40] that he can release the fullness of the
[37:42] holy ghost and the fullness of the holy
[37:44] ghost
[37:44] has visited a church making manifest
[37:47] luke 17 30
[37:48] this son of man back again in this last
[37:50] day
[37:51] oh glory to god and i believe the angel
[37:53] of god the manifestation of the holy
[37:55] spirit is that angel
[37:56] trying to get the people back to the
[37:58] word because he could only vindicate the
[38:00] word
[38:01] and now he's here to gather up and tie
[38:04] all the loose ends in your life
[38:06] so tonight you have to be under
[38:08] expectation
[38:09] for your loosens for your looseness to
[38:11] be tied up
[38:12] because before you could get that full
[38:14] manifestation of introducing the messiah
[38:17] the sixty you have to tie up all the
[38:18] loosens and before you get your portion
[38:21] before you get your inheritance before
[38:23] you get your baptism
[38:24] before you get your fire before you get
[38:26] your dynamics
[38:27] you have got to tie up the loose ends in
[38:30] your life
[38:31] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[38:33] hallelujah hallelujah
[38:35] he said he will do for you the same you
[38:37] don't want to adoption if you will stand
[38:39] here we go
[38:40] after you receive the holy ghost and
[38:42] make yourself
[38:43] a christian you don't born a christian
[38:46] you're the joint church and become a
[38:47] christian
[38:48] you say i make yourself a christian
[38:51] you have something to do because we give
[38:53] the lord a shout tonight
[38:55] make yourself a christian and act like a
[38:57] christian should
[38:58] if you put your face in god's word and
[39:01] your eyes towards heaven
[39:02] and let your pants be batted at the
[39:04] knees and be reverent
[39:05] before god there will be someday that
[39:08] god will
[39:08] take you over to a side and give you a
[39:11] power and a gift
[39:12] that the whole world will know he's been
[39:15] with you
[39:18] placing a son in position oh blessed be
[39:20] the name of the lord you love him
[39:26] tonight
[39:31] so the bible said his wife not the
[39:33] jewish members
[39:36] the scripture his wife had been yourself
[39:38] ready
[39:39] the church members will just continue on
[39:40] being church members but the wife
[39:42] she want to make
[39:46] herself ready
[39:50] so many says if the lord will take this
[39:52] evil spirit from me
[39:54] from drinking or from gambling or from
[39:57] lying
[39:58] or stealing i will serve him but that's
[40:00] up to you
[40:04] you see you have got something to
[40:06] something to do something too
[40:08] dare to overcome inherit all things they
[40:11] don't overcome
[40:12] you have power to do it
[40:16] that's the word now that is the word now
[40:19] i don't care what you feel or what you
[40:21] think this is the word now
[40:22] the word tell me that that you have
[40:26] power to do it
[40:27] the words say that and the word can't
[40:30] lie
[40:32] let your feelings be a lie tonight not
[40:34] that word
[40:35] that word is true
[40:40] you have power to do it but you must be
[40:43] willing
[40:44] to lay it down she has made herself
[40:47] ready
[40:48] oh my when i see and i'm seeing it more
[40:51] and more how far
[40:53] churches and and people has fell away
[40:55] from god
[40:56] fell away from the principles fell away
[40:59] from the spirit fell away from the
[41:00] expectation
[41:01] and it's all mechanical and intellectual
[41:04] and just
[41:05] it's it's astonishing that's why god
[41:08] said in jeremiah it's astonishment
[41:11] i bring you all to bless you and
[41:12] everything else and like my people
[41:14] leave and find other gods

[41:22] heal them out systems
[41:24] broken systems that can hold no water
[41:28] they leave the living fountain
[41:31] you see god could not push us through a
[41:33] little pipe
[41:34] and pull us out the other side and say
[41:36] blessed is he that overcome it
[41:39] you have nothing to overcome so i want
[41:41] to rip the entitlement over you
[41:43] that you believe a message are you
[41:45] entitled to what you're entitled to
[41:46] fight
[41:48] for every single inch that is what
[41:50] you're entitled to
[41:53] the entities are no rapture you're
[41:55] entitled to the resurrection

[42:00] like the special thing not what he would
[42:02] say in here you have to have rapture in
[42:04] faith
[42:05] that's the ticket you have to have it to
[42:07] leave here who gives the lord a shout
[42:10] not teaching you have to have that
[42:13] that's why you said malakai for to turn
[42:15] our hearts back
[42:16] to the faith of the fathers that are
[42:18] living faith that a living god
[42:20] that a reality a manifested reality
[42:23] of the glory of god was in their midst
[42:26] or give the lord a shout
[42:28] that a person their spirit when they
[42:30] beat them they went back and pray
[42:32] and the building shook and they were
[42:34] refilled with the holy ghost
[42:36] that's why the prophet said the dynamic
[42:37] that this church will be a refilling of
[42:39] the holy ghost
[42:40] oh glory to god hallelujah get your soul
[42:43] on fire

[43:07] he just pushed you through but you've
[43:09] got to make decisions

[44:20] respects
[44:21] to god abraham was promised a child but
[44:24] he was maintained this promise for
[44:26] 25 years the ups and downs he had
[44:29] the temptations in those 25 years but he
[44:32] held to the world of promise
[44:33] and israel was promised a promised land

[44:49] healing god has got the power to heal
[44:51] you

[44:58] and he will do it but you have to fight
[45:00] every inch of your way

[51:48] word have to filter down to your very
[51:50] life
[51:50] it's not paul when he churchill is
[51:52] following you
[51:54] are when paul was in you and paul is a
[51:55] new one powering you and powering all of
[51:57] us when we come together there's power
[51:58] in the church
[51:59] because there's power in the individual
[52:04] what did he say about revival the people
[52:06] of the bring the revival where they're
[52:07] beginning from
[52:08] in their homes that we start with
[52:10] nothing in your homes you start to boot
[52:11] up that devil
[52:12] you boot up the magazine don't worry
[52:14] applying the token all the filth
[52:16] all the trash get kicked out your house
[52:18] oh glory to god that applied to tv shows
[52:20] and movies too
[52:21] or to cut them things off because those
[52:23] are doorways and entrance to
[52:25] spirits
[52:29] whether you say amen or not i still say
[52:31] nation
[52:35] god hits a powerless religion it's got
[52:38] to have power in it
[52:40] it's got to have sincerity sincerity
[52:44] brings power
[52:49] how could you be sincere when you're in
[52:50] iniquity
[52:53] or you could be sincere when you're
[52:54] doing the wrong thing
[52:57] how you could be sincere when you know
[52:58] in your heart you're wrong
[53:00] you can't be sincere you could be
[53:02] sincere to repent
[53:04] and then you get right then you could
[53:07] ask god
[53:08] if your heart condemned your god greater
[53:09] than your heart your heart condemning
[53:11] you
[53:13] so god want to release you from that
[53:14] condemnation to bring you into a
[53:16] cleansing that's why
[53:18] go back and listen and study back that
[53:20] message that we talk on tuesday
[53:23] about sanctification what god wants for
[53:25] your life
[53:26] and that is the will of god for your
[53:28] life sincerity brings power a long time
[53:31] you hear that like that
[53:32] sincerity that's why god tell the
[53:34] prophet what be more sincere
[53:36] when god examined the heart and god put
[53:38] all his instruments and so on
[53:39] everybody externally saying big prophet
[53:41] and prophet and prophet but when god put
[53:42] his binoculars and do his zoom zoom and
[53:44] zoom inside there he said i want you to
[53:46] be more sincere
[53:48] that is the realm of the spirit there's
[53:50] the realm of people getting delivered
[53:52] that is in that realm there and that was
[53:55] jesus i sanctify myself for dear sake
[53:58] you have got to make a sacrifice you can
[54:00] sit down like you some king on some
[54:01] throne
[54:02] and god entitled to do this for you and
[54:04] do that for you god entitled to do
[54:05] nothing for you
[54:06] he entitled he sent a prophet and he
[54:08] shall turn half and he put a message
[54:10] here
[54:10] for us to take and apply or give the
[54:12] lord a shout he said hear me when i'm
[54:14] taminacker
[54:15] not talking about his token you've got
[54:17] to apply the token
[54:18] oh glory to god and the token have to be
[54:20] displayed
[54:22] not just applied but displayed it means
[54:24] that you have to take it
[54:25] act upon it and then you have to have it
[54:27] so activated it's had to come back out
[54:29] to you
[54:30] to reflect the very thing that you apply
[54:34] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[54:38] but genuine power worship to know your
[54:41] past from death unto life
[54:43] god wants to perform his word by his
[54:45] power and when the church denies his
[54:47] power
[54:47] how can he perform and vindicate his
[54:50] word when the church explains it away
[54:52] and see from some other day who wants to
[54:54] fulfill that word
[54:56] oh hallelujah praise beaten
[54:59] them of jesus hallelujah loose ends make
[55:03] the church weak
[55:04] powerless loosens in your life making

[1:00:32] in front secure but what you didn't
[1:00:34] secure was the back door
[1:00:35] you have to tie up the loose ends
[1:00:39] could we say amen all right
[1:00:42] a man under pressure is what he is when
[1:00:45] he's under pressure
[1:00:46] his real true characteristics will show
[1:00:49] when he's under pressure get him all
[1:00:52] riled up and stood up
[1:00:53] you will see the real man come out if he
[1:00:55] got temper it will show itself
[1:00:57] if he's meek and gentle the ritual
[1:00:58] itself put him under pressure once
[1:01:00] and god puts all his children
[1:01:04] on the test to see whether there is any
[1:01:07] flaws in them
[1:01:08] flaws before the test coming this flows
[1:01:12] i mean that's coming to expose more
[1:01:14] flows
[1:01:14] what a position interesting to embarrass
[1:01:16] you know
[1:01:18] you got to know where the floors are at
[1:01:19] to tie it up
[1:01:24] to get it covered to get protected
[1:01:28] you're the story your life thinks oh
[1:01:29] lord i can't hear your words
[1:01:31] whatever you are the life that you live

[1:01:36] you may impersonate the wrong thing or
[1:01:38] impersonate the writing
[1:01:39] you may impersonate a christian but they
[1:01:42] will by and by come a time
[1:01:44] when the strain will be put on then it
[1:01:47] will show what you
[1:01:48] are a chain is as strong as his weakest
[1:01:51] link
[1:01:53] so then he talked about the virtues now
[1:01:54] this is why he's such a perfect man
[1:01:56] he's talking about no matter how strong
[1:01:58] this is built up and that is built up if
[1:02:00] he got a weak link
[1:02:01] there's where she breaks so you could be
[1:02:03] strong in faith
[1:02:04] i'm gonna fit you speak any word and
[1:02:06] whatnot and then
[1:02:08] you see temperance whoo

[1:02:22] practice all the time it runs straight
[1:02:23] out

[1:02:26] calls for charity to burn the
[1:02:27] perfectness
[1:02:28] to seal the whole building that there'll
[1:02:30] be no leaks in the building
[1:02:32] after your feet virtue and knowledge and

[1:03:28] god has that have been positionally
[1:03:30] placed
[1:03:31] with the pillar fire veiled oh glory to
[1:03:33] god
[1:03:34] what a thing to look forward to what a
[1:03:36] thing to expect
[1:03:37] hallelujah they ought to be nobody tired
[1:03:40] and they
[1:03:40] struggling and they automatic oh you're

[1:03:48] things going to come
[1:03:50] hallelujah nations against nation wars
[1:03:52] and rumors of wars
[1:03:53] earthquakes and diverse places
[1:03:55] pestilence and all kinds of stuff
[1:03:57] but this gospel must be preached and
[1:04:00] then shall the end come
[1:04:01] no no coming until this gospel is
[1:04:04] preached
[1:04:04] oh glory to god and the only way this
[1:04:06] gospel is preached is that bright
[1:04:08] positionally placed with power
[1:04:10] to preach his gospel with signs one of
[1:04:12] the miracles reproducing the original
[1:04:14] green
[1:04:15] proven hebrew state in it that jesus
[1:04:17] christ is the same
[1:04:18] yesterday today and forever oh give the
[1:04:21] lord some praises tonight
[1:04:23] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:04:26] hallelujah
[1:04:27] so you have to have all these virtues
[1:04:29] inside of there he said when you
[1:04:30] surrender your complete being
[1:04:32] then the holy spirit just pours through
[1:04:34] you watch
[1:04:35] in these virtues you are living
[1:04:38] tabernacle
[1:04:39] you see oh this is a concrete tabernacle
[1:04:41] you becomes a living tabernacle because
[1:04:43] the whole spirit is flowing through you
[1:04:44] why because all the virtues inside of
[1:04:46] you so he's using his own word
[1:04:48] or glowing no no flesh and blood trying
[1:04:50] to play a tango or trying a little thing
[1:04:52] it's not that it's the holy spirit
[1:04:54] flowing through the word inside of you
[1:04:56] you become a conduit you become a branch
[1:04:58] and divine life is flowing through you
[1:05:01] they preproduce fruit that's a man full
[1:05:04] of virtue then people look
[1:05:05] and see that's a man full of virtue
[1:05:08] knowledge he believes the word
[1:05:09] temperance patience
[1:05:11] godliness brotherly kindness full of
[1:05:12] love of of the holy ghost
[1:05:14] what is it a stature that the
[1:05:16] unbelievers can look and say there's a
[1:05:18] christian
[1:05:19] there's a man or woman who knows what
[1:05:22] they're talking about
[1:05:23] you've never seen a kinder sweeter godly
[1:05:26] person
[1:05:26] you are sealed i see your shoes on both
[1:05:29] sides
[1:05:29] whether you're coming or going you are
[1:05:31] sealed just the same
[1:05:32] there you are when a man or woman
[1:05:34] possesses this then
[1:05:36] the capstone comes down and sees them
[1:05:39] into the kingdom of god
[1:05:40] which is the holy ghost i know you know
[1:05:44] here taught much but when a man
[1:05:45] possesses
[1:05:46] this what this fate of birthday kindness
[1:05:48] then they kept
[1:05:49] charity the holy ghost itself comes down
[1:05:51] seal the man inside the idea
[1:05:53] then that must speak for his servants
[1:05:54] christ failed oh hallelujah
[1:05:57] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:06:01] now to fix a problem you have to
[1:06:04] recognize
[1:06:05] that the problem exists
[1:06:10] i think that would say in a game to fix
[1:06:14] any problem
[1:06:15] you have to understand a problem exist
[1:06:18] because if you don't think the problem
[1:06:20] exists you can't fix it
[1:06:24] you can't fix if you don't know there's
[1:06:26] a problem
[1:06:30] but david said i acknowledge my
[1:06:32] transgression
[1:06:34] and my sin is before me so the first
[1:06:38] thing
[1:06:38] is to identify and acknowledge your
[1:06:40] loose ends
[1:06:44] no that's not my losers like yours i am
[1:06:47] mind satire
[1:06:49] everybody have their own to tie up i'm
[1:06:52] not hearing you
[1:06:53] whether you say amen or not you still
[1:06:55] have to tie it up
[1:06:56] because if you don't tie it up the devil
[1:06:58] will tie you up
[1:07:00] or give the lord a shout is either you
[1:07:01] tie up your loose ends or the devil tie
[1:07:03] you up
[1:07:04] because enticing spirits and classical
[1:07:06] spirits going to follow loosens
[1:07:14] identify the loose ends and deal with
[1:07:17] them by the word
[1:07:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:23] oh glory to god but as human nature
[1:07:27] we avoid or deny many times we go into
[1:07:31] denial we don't want to accept this is
[1:07:33] so
[1:07:34] this is how we going through or this is
[1:07:36] what taken us or this one overtaking us
[1:07:38] we don't want to admit it
[1:07:41] hallelujah loosens can be spiritual
[1:07:45] physical emotional
[1:07:49] intellectual or logical
[1:07:53] sometimes it's not a pleasant thing
[1:07:56] loose ends is what we push aside
[1:07:58] loose sense is what you don't want to
[1:07:59] deal with right loosen the water you
[1:08:01] prefer to sleep and to deal with it
[1:08:04] so you sleep longer why do these people
[1:08:07] go and drink
[1:08:09] do people go on booze they're certainly
[1:08:11] loose ends and
[1:08:12] issues that they don't want to deal with

[1:08:54] completion you have to
[1:08:56] finish you have to meet the demands of
[1:08:58] what it demands of you
[1:09:02] you come like there's a leak in the roof
[1:09:04] and and
[1:09:06] i don't want to go there but i'm there
[1:09:08] already

[1:09:11] there i said kevin leake
[1:09:14] yeah and there's a lot up there
[1:09:19] another way the rings had to fall you
[1:09:21] get bigger and bigger one month past two
[1:09:22] months past one year past two years past
[1:09:24] three
[1:09:24] years when you're ready to stick up last
[1:09:26] on top of it
[1:09:28] it's still there we got to study the
[1:09:30] other girl ladder you go on top of the
[1:09:32] roof or get somebody to go up the roof
[1:09:33] and fix it but it has to be done
[1:09:35] so a lot of things that you have that
[1:09:37] need to be done after tonight
[1:09:42] confession of sins hidden for years
[1:09:46] whatever it means it means to tie up
[1:09:50] those loose ends oh hallelujah
[1:09:53] could we continue a little more god
[1:09:56] tempered this bride together with the
[1:09:58] spirit the tempest the individual
[1:09:59] together with that spirit
[1:10:01] when you are born into that kingdom very
[1:10:03] life that is in his church
[1:10:05] that was in life was in the vine jesus
[1:10:07] is inside of you
[1:10:08] isn't that right what body do you belong
[1:10:11] to the body of christ i want to skip
[1:10:13] down
[1:10:13] and watch he said no watch there can be
[1:10:16] a leak up here somewhere there can be a
[1:10:18] leak in your patience
[1:10:19] let somebody smite you on one side of
[1:10:20] the face and you turn the other one
[1:10:22] but you said that dirty hypocrite then
[1:10:24] there's a leak somewhere
[1:10:25] so you see somebody smite here and then
[1:10:27] it's exposed where you're leaking
[1:10:29] he said we better leave that alone now
[1:10:31] when you are sealed into the
[1:10:33] the body of christ then you are
[1:10:34] spirit-filled and you're a son of god
[1:10:37] now when closing i might say this
[1:10:41] anything different from this is a broken
[1:10:44] system
[1:10:45] and will finally leak out what you put
[1:10:47] in it
[1:10:48] if you are putting all your hopes all
[1:10:51] your time and everything
[1:10:52] in one of those stagnated systems they
[1:10:55] are broken systems
[1:10:56] and they will leak out their people put
[1:10:58] their hopes in churches
[1:11:00] hopes and pastors and ministers they
[1:11:03] hope not in christ
[1:11:05] and they will be disappointed because
[1:11:08] man will feel them
[1:11:09] and churches will feel them but jesus
[1:11:13] never fails so your hope has to be built
[1:11:17] in jesus christ
[1:11:18] and his righteousness isn't that right
[1:11:21] hallelujah
[1:11:22] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:24] praise god
[1:11:26] so if we could only be in the objective
[1:11:28] of this pentecostal move i'll just get
[1:11:29] down
[1:11:30] you talk about samson right and blinded
[1:11:33] and they stood there as big bulk of
[1:11:36] frame
[1:11:36] powerless and helpless all at once he
[1:11:39] began to something
[1:11:40] feel something happening every five of
[1:11:42] his body began to be filled with the
[1:11:44] power of god
[1:11:45] if the church could only get to that
[1:11:47] again all the way from the preacher to
[1:11:49] the deacon
[1:11:50] to the laity every fiber every member of
[1:11:52] the body
[1:11:53] will be filled with the holy ghost those
[1:11:56] bronies
[1:11:57] muscles straighten out and he crushed it
[1:11:59] all together let me die with them lord
[1:12:01] let me die with them you raised me up to
[1:12:03] destroy it
[1:12:04] no i've built myself along it let me
[1:12:06] destroy myself with it
[1:12:07] my reputation whatever it is let me
[1:12:09] destroy it i want to see the power of
[1:12:11] god again
[1:12:12] always when the power of god comes in
[1:12:15] the walls that you built around you fall
[1:12:19] your denominational walls will crush
[1:12:21] that's why we know it's no power wrong
[1:12:23] you know because
[1:12:24] walls building up them have some stone
[1:12:26] masons just going with the walls
[1:12:30] and every every every year the walls
[1:12:31] going higher and higher and higher
[1:12:33] as if they put taken those inside the
[1:12:34] deal with the walls
[1:12:36] but you have a rain coming you have
[1:12:39] water coming
[1:12:40] not i didn't say that and that's
[1:12:41] prophecy you know and the ducks will
[1:12:43] swim
[1:12:44] over the walls there's a great moving
[1:12:47] spirit going on happen you know
[1:12:48] that going to break upon people you know
[1:12:51] you're going to hear more about it on
[1:12:52] sunday
[1:12:53] hallelujah hallelujah because you see
[1:12:56] the people i see the gaussian life yet
[1:12:58] when that light begins to gush forget it
[1:13:01] every pedestrian
[1:13:02] seat have to connect with that because
[1:13:04] they are the life itself
[1:13:06] is the spirit of the seed that is in
[1:13:08] them
[1:13:09] let me say they're again good they're in
[1:13:11] churches now
[1:13:12] but that is not where they belong they
[1:13:15] belong into the logos
[1:13:16] which is the full body word which is the
[1:13:19] fullness of the atonement
[1:13:20] they belong to this message it's not
[1:13:22] just a message you know there's a
[1:13:23] message in the message
[1:13:25] and the message in the message is the
[1:13:26] bride's message because this message
[1:13:28] called tree kind of believers
[1:13:30] but there's a message in the message
[1:13:32] that is exclusive for the bride
[1:13:34] oh glory to god and it it will take the
[1:13:36] life to leave here
[1:13:37] he said this being this statue when it's
[1:13:39] completed
[1:13:40] is the servant of god in the church of
[1:13:42] god that's going on a rapture he said
[1:13:44] nothing but
[1:13:48] oh glory to god when it is completed
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:52] that means you have to start they have
[1:13:53] to complete inside of you
[1:13:55] and then that is what going to the
[1:13:56] rapture i'd like to say this way it's
[1:13:58] not you bullying rapture you know

[1:14:24] you can't borrow anybody if you think
[1:14:25] about it you can't borrow anybody's feet

[1:18:14] right
[1:18:15] why you cannot take communion something
[1:18:17] is wrong
[1:18:18] resolution in your life because
[1:18:20] everybody is supposed to
[1:18:21] take communion and the only reason that
[1:18:24] you're not taking it is because
[1:18:25] something is wrong in your life we need
[1:18:28] to get to that
[1:18:29] you need to get to that deal with that
[1:18:33] get right with god and partake of the
[1:18:35] bread
[1:18:36] another wine remember this christ
[1:18:40] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:18:42] the book of acts
[1:18:43] and the book of revelation shows how the
[1:18:45] antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:18:47] church and defile it
[1:18:48] making it how lukewarm formal
[1:18:52] and powerless it exposes satan
[1:18:55] revealing his works uh the attempted
[1:18:57] destruction of god's people
[1:18:59] and if and and he fights and and right
[1:19:01] down to the time he's cast in the lake
[1:19:03] of fire
[1:19:04] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:19:07] knows here we go
[1:19:08] if the people get the true revelation of
[1:19:11] the true church
[1:19:12] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:19:15] that she
[1:19:16] can do the greater works she will be an
[1:19:19] invincible army
[1:19:20] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:19:23] spirits working within the framework of
[1:19:25] the christian church
[1:19:26] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:19:29] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:19:31] and i was thinking about this thing
[1:19:32] about this word design and how there's
[1:19:34] such a great need of this illness
[1:19:36] because you have in this wilderness will
[1:19:37] protect you from spirits and deceivers
[1:19:40] ask god for diseasement designment of
[1:19:43] spirit
[1:19:44] oh hallelujah by god's spirit discern
[1:19:47] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:19:49] satan will be powerless before her he
[1:19:51] will be definitely tortured today
[1:19:52] as when christ withstood his every
[1:19:54] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:19:55] desert
[1:19:56] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:19:59] it
[1:19:59] where true revelation allies the gates
[1:20:02] of hell
[1:20:02] cannot prevail against it but we will
[1:20:04] prevail against them
[1:20:06] oh glory to god when the church
[1:20:10] allowed herself to move away from the
[1:20:14] original
[1:20:15] like adam and eve dead set in
[1:20:18] there was no strength in her she has
[1:20:21] become a monstrosity
[1:20:23] the minute the church moved towards form
[1:20:27] and ceremony and towards priesthood by
[1:20:30] organizing the ministers into a
[1:20:32] group that decided leadership apart from
[1:20:35] the holy spirit
[1:20:36] and his word that very moment dead
[1:20:38] entered
[1:20:39] and she started to get sick and as she
[1:20:42] got sick
[1:20:43] here we go she changed to a powerless
[1:20:47] group of
[1:20:48] people whose only weapon was argument
[1:20:56] only weapon i write you wrong
[1:20:59] mysteries you don't have none i have
[1:21:01] this you have that you have this only
[1:21:03] argument
[1:21:05] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[1:21:08] for her hopes were built on program and
[1:21:10] not faith in his word
[1:21:12] they sold program they reprogram the
[1:21:15] supervision
[1:21:16] the repertoire children so whatever you
[1:21:19] need to do
[1:21:21] to close and to tie up that loose end
[1:21:24] go do it i ain't talking about
[1:21:27] talking all this is getting into action
[1:21:29] this is you confronting yourself
[1:21:31] and sitting down because our enemy come
[1:21:33] in
[1:21:34] and you have to know how you're going to
[1:21:36] wage war and if you have what it takes
[1:21:38] to deal with what's coming
[1:21:42] don't think it's business as usual
[1:21:45] this coronavirus confirm is not business
[1:21:48] as usual
[1:21:49] all demoting is business as usual
[1:21:50] getting flogged fair
[1:21:52] it is not business as usual okay
[1:21:58] i'm finished you could play something
[1:22:04] what are loose ends the untidy stuff
[1:22:08] the area of weakness the area
[1:22:12] of leakage and when
[1:22:15] those areas are tied up the weakness
[1:22:18] disappears and you feel that strength
[1:22:22] coming back to you again
[1:22:26] hallelujah illusion in the garment or
[1:22:30] dress
[1:22:31] an area of weakness that make you dress
[1:22:33] weak and it provokes the avenue for
[1:22:36] further weakness
[1:22:38] when the devil find that weak spot and
[1:22:40] he hit your dear he come back again
[1:22:44] he want to break you and destroy you
[1:22:49] that leakage is where you lose
[1:22:53] the energy where you become less
[1:22:56] productive
[1:22:58] keeps you in a depressed mode you just
[1:23:01] don't know
[1:23:02] what to do you just don't have the
[1:23:04] strength and everything else
[1:23:06] but when they begin to tap the loose
[1:23:08] ends power comes back
[1:23:11] strength come back you have to be able
[1:23:14] to identify
[1:23:17] and acknowledge your loose ends
[1:23:20] is not right and to deal with them
[1:23:24] whether it's painful whether it's
