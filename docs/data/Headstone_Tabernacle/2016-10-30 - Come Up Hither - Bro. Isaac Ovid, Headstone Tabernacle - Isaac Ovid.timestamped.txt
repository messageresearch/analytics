[4:13] from verse
[4:14] one says, "Make a joyful noise unto God,
[4:18] all he lands. Sing forth the honor of
[4:21] his name. Make his praise
[4:24] glorious. Say unto God, how terrible art
[4:26] thou in thy works. Through the greatness
[4:29] of thy power shall thine enemies submit
[4:31] themselves unto thee. All the earth
[4:34] shall worship thee, and shall sing unto
[4:36] thee. They shall sing unto thy name,
[4:39] sailor. Come and see the works of God.
[4:42] He is terrible in his doing toward the
[4:44] children of men. He turned the sea into
[4:47] dry land. They went through the flood on
[4:50] foot. There did we rejoice in him. He
[4:54] ruleth by his power forever. His eyes
[4:57] behold the nations. Let not the
[4:59] rebellious exalt themselves, sailor. Oh,
[5:03] bless God our God, ye people, and make
[5:07] the voice of his praise to be heard,
[5:09] which holdeth our soul in life, and
[5:12] suffereth not our feet to be moved. For
[5:15] thou, oh God, has proved us. Thou hast
[5:17] tried us as silverish tried. Thou
[5:20] brought us us into the net. Thou laid us
[5:24] affliction upon our loins. Thou has
[5:26] caused men to ride over our heads. We
[5:29] went through fire and water, but thou
[5:32] bringest us out into a wealthy place. I
[5:35] will go into thy house with burned
[5:38] offerings, and I will pay thee my vows,
[5:41] which my lips have uttered, and my mouth
[5:43] had spoken when I was in trouble. I will
[5:46] offer unto thee burned sacrifices of
[5:48] fatlings, with the incense of rams. I
[5:50] will offer bulocks with goats sailor.
[5:53] Come and hear all ye that fear God and I
[5:56] will declare what he hath done for my
[6:00] soul. May God add blessing to the ring
[6:03] of his word. Are you here to offer a
[6:05] sacrifice of praise unto the Lord this
[6:07] morning? Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh
[6:11] hallelujah. Let's just enter into the
[6:12] spirit now as we want to pray and call
[6:15] upon the name of the Lord this morning
[6:17] for the service today. Oh hallelujah.

[7:52] come into your house with thanksgiving
[7:55] and enter into your courts with praise,
[7:57] Lord, Father, a praise on our lips,
[7:59] Lord, and a song in our hearts, Lord,
[8:01] Father, about how you brought us
[8:03] through, Lord, Father. How you bring us
[8:05] out, oh God, Father, and how your blood
[8:08] is here this morning, Lord, speaking
[8:10] better things on our behalf, Lord.

[8:17] speaking for us this morning. Oh,
[8:19] hallelujah. We celebrate your name this
[8:21] morning. We pray, Lord, that your
[8:23] presence would come down in this place
[8:25] when we anoint your people and inspire
[8:27] them. Lift us up, oh God, Father, as we
[8:30] welcome your presence in this house, oh
[8:32] God. Have your way with each one, Lord,
[8:34] Father. Bless each one, Lord. Those that
[8:36] are on their way, Lord, Father, those on
[8:37] the internet, Lord. May anointing just
[8:39] flow through this morning, Lord. And may

[34:32] longer with you. I made up my mind to go
[34:36] God's way the rest of my life.
[34:42] Oh god, for the last time. Goodbye
[34:46] world.
[34:48] Goodbye.
[34:53] Oh, goodbye. Pleasures of
[34:57] sin. I stand no longer with you. I made
[35:01] up my mind to go God's way the rest of
[35:05] my life.
[35:07] Oh, made up my mind to go God's way the
[35:11] rest of my
[35:13] life. Can the church give the Lord a
[35:15] shout of praise in the presence of the
[35:18] Lord this
[35:19] morning? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[35:24] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[35:27] Lord. Feels good in here this morning.
[35:30] Feels good in here this morning. Tomb
[35:33] devils are on the run. Oh, we are in the
[35:36] spirit of the Lord on the day of the
[35:39] Lord. It's the Lord's day and it is a
[35:42] good day. It's a wonderful day. I was
[35:45] glad when they said unto me, "Let us go
[35:48] into the house of the Lord." Is that how
[35:51] you feel this morning? Hallelujah.
[35:54] Glory. Blessed be the name of the
[35:57] Lord. We do have one note of praise from
[36:00] the Ruskin Cummings. I want to thank
[36:02] everyone for their prayers from last
[36:03] week. I'm feeling much better. Amen.
[36:06] We're so happy to hear that we thank the
[36:08] Lord this
[36:09] morning. So I greet you this morning in
[36:12] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[36:14] Christ. It is certainly a great
[36:16] privilege to be in the house of the
[36:18] Lord. I like to go straight to the word
[36:22] reading from one portion of
[36:27] scripture reading from the book of
[36:30] Revelation chapter 4. Thank you
[36:32] musicians. Thank you brother Anthony for
[36:35] such an anointed song service. You
[36:37] appreciate brother Anthony and the
[36:39] musicians. How many appreciate the
[36:41] service last week? You appreciate our
[36:43] pastor.
[36:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. So Revelation chapter
[36:49] 4 reading from verse
[36:52] 1. After this I looked and behold a door
[36:56] was opened in heaven. And the first
[36:59] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[37:03] trumpet talking with me, which said,
[37:05] "Come up hither, and I will show thee
[37:07] things which must be hereafter." And
[37:12] immediately I was in the spirit. And
[37:15] behold, a throne was set in heaven, and
[37:17] one sat on the throne. And he that sat
[37:20] was to look upon like a jasper and a
[37:22] sardine stone. And there was a rainbow
[37:25] round about the throne in sight like
[37:27] unto an emerald. And round about the
[37:29] throne were four and 20 seats. And upon
[37:32] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[37:34] sitting clothed in wide reignment. And
[37:38] they had on their heads crowns of gold.
[37:41] And out of the throne proceeded
[37:43] lightnings and thunder rings and voices.
[37:46] And there were seven lamps of fire
[37:48] burning before the throne, which are the
[37:50] seven spirits of God.
[37:53] And before the throne there was a sea of
[37:56] glass like unto crystal. And in the
[37:58] midst of the throne, and round about the
[38:00] throne were four beasts full of eyes
[38:03] before and behind. And the first beast
[38:06] was like a lion, and the second beast
[38:08] like a calf. And the third beast had a
[38:11] face as a man, and the fourth beast was
[38:13] like a flying eagle. And the four beasts
[38:15] had each of them six wings about him.
[38:18] And they were full of eyes within and
[38:20] they rest not day and night saying,
[38:22] "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
[38:25] which was and is and is to come." And
[38:28] when those beasts give glory and honor
[38:30] and thanks to him that sat on the
[38:32] throne, which liveth forever and ever,
[38:35] the four and 20 elders fall down before
[38:38] him that sat on the throne, and worship
[38:40] him that liveth forever and ever, and
[38:42] cast their crowns before the throne,
[38:44] saying, Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to
[38:46] receive glory and honor and power, for
[38:49] thou hast created all things, and for
[38:51] thy pleasure they are and were created.
[38:55] Can we bow our heads for a word of
[38:56] prayer? Our gracious heavenly father, we
[38:58] are so humbled this morning to be in
[39:00] your presence. Father, Lord, many of us
[39:03] had, Lord, all kinds of a week this
[39:05] week, Lord, with ups and downs and
[39:08] trials and testings and strains and
[39:11] stresses and Lord, it has not been an
[39:13] easy journey, but we thank you that your
[39:16] grace has brought us here this morning.
[39:18] We didn't come by our own strength. We
[39:20] are not here by our own ability. We are
[39:22] not here because we are stronger than
[39:25] anybody but better than anybody. But it
[39:27] is your grace and your blood that made a
[39:29] way for us, Father. Oh wretched men that
[39:32] we are, Father, that you would call us,
[39:34] Lord, to this marvelous light, Father.
[39:36] Now, may you walk out the pages of the
[39:38] Bible and speak to your people, Lord, in
[39:41] a way they have never heard before. May
[39:43] they hear that voice, that voice that
[39:45] summoned Lazarus. May they hear that
[39:47] voice, that voice that spoke to John.
[39:49] May they hear that voice that spoke to
[39:51] your prophet, Lord. May you speak to
[39:54] each one here this morning. May you use
[39:56] me as your instrument. Take me out of
[39:58] the way. I don't have a message of my
[40:00] own. It is your message. May you come to
[40:02] life to your people this morning. May
[40:04] you, Lord, break the chains of the
[40:06] captives in the house this morning.
[40:08] Lord, there are those that are sick.
[40:10] They are weary. They are tired. Lord,
[40:12] may heal and rain pour out this morning.
[40:14] If there's a backslider here this
[40:16] morning, Father, may you deliver them,
[40:18] Lord, from whatever is binding them.
[40:20] Father, we curse every foul spirit,
[40:23] every unclean spirit, every negative
[40:25] spirit. We come against it by the power
[40:28] of the Holy Ghost in the name of the
[40:30] Lord Jesus Christ. Uh, and we declare
[40:33] this ground to be a delivery room this
[40:35] morning, a delivery room to deliver your
[40:38] sons and daughters from the clasp of the
[40:40] enemy. House of hell, give way to the
[40:43] name of Jesus. May you anoint the
[40:45] reading of the word. May you anoint the
[40:47] opening of the word to your people. And
[40:49] may we leave this place with a shout.
[40:51] May we leave this place in the spirit.
[40:54] May we leave this place inspired. May we
[40:56] leave this house motivated. May we leave
[40:59] in courage. Uh may we leave on another
[41:01] level. Uh may you lift us up like the
[41:03] eagles fly Lord to where we really
[41:06] belong. We have been living under our
[41:08] privileges for a very long time. Uh but
[41:11] today is a new day. Uh we are in the
[41:14] Lord's day today. Father, may you drop
[41:16] down the shikina glory. May the august
[41:20] presence deity himself. Uh Lord, may he
[41:22] reveal himself to sons and daughters. We
[41:25] commit the service into your hands in
[41:27] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[41:30] the church says And the church says
[41:33] amen. You may be seated in the presence
[41:35] of the Lord. Uh, anybody excited to be
[41:38] in the house of the Lord? Uh, anybody
[41:40] excited to be a Christian? Excited to be
[41:43] called in such a time as this?
[41:45] Hallelujah. What's your identification?
[41:48] The hot trials, that's your
[41:50] identification. The pressures, that's
[41:52] your identification. Because God is
[41:54] going to have some diamonds. Uh, he's
[41:56] going to have some pearls. He's going to
[41:58] have some jewels. And all of these
[42:00] things have something in common. It
[42:02] takes a certain amount of pressure to
[42:04] bring out the best in us. So we thank
[42:06] God for the pressure. We thank God when
[42:09] we are forsaken. We thank God when we
[42:11] are desolate. We thank God for when we
[42:13] are empty because nothing could happen
[42:15] that God does not allow. Your trials,
[42:19] God allowed it. Uh because your back is
[42:21] broad enough to handle it. Your trials
[42:24] has your name written on it. Uh don't
[42:26] try to avoid it. It's for your good.
[42:28] It's for your edification. It's for your
[42:31] strengthening. It's to define who you
[42:33] are. It's for you to get the stamp of
[42:35] approval that your character meets the
[42:38] requirement uh that God has for you. So,
[42:41] I'm excited this morning because the
[42:43] trial that you have right now is not
[42:46] worthy to be compared uh with the glory
[42:48] that's going to be revealed in you. So,
[42:50] lift your head up uh square your
[42:53] shoulders back. Walk the way you're
[42:55] supposed to walk because you are sons
[42:58] and daughters of the living God. I
[43:00] didn't ask what you did yesterday. Sons
[43:02] make mistakes. Uh I didn't ask what you
[43:04] did last week. Uh daughters make
[43:06] mistake. Uh your conditions, your past,
[43:09] your mistakes have nothing to do with
[43:11] who you are. You could try to change
[43:13] your name. But in God's mind, you have a
[43:16] name. Uh and there's a new name coming.
[43:18] He's looking at you right now. And he's
[43:21] calling from the east. Uh he's calling
[43:22] from the west. He's calling from the
[43:25] north. And he's calling from the south.
[43:27] And if any man hear my voice, he said,
[43:29] "All that the father had given me must
[43:32] come." There's a voice that's calling
[43:34] this morning. And when that voice begins
[43:37] to speak up, there is no kind of
[43:39] rebuttal. There's no kind of answer.
[43:42] There's no coming. When that voice said,
[43:45] "Lazarus, come forth." Lazarus was tied
[43:48] up and he had to come. He was bound and
[43:51] he had to come. He was wrapped up, but
[43:54] he had to come. So even after Jesus
[43:57] called him, he had to tell him, "Loose
[43:59] him and let him go." He is free, but he
[44:02] doesn't know it. He's on fire, but he
[44:05] doesn't know it. He has been dead, but
[44:08] now he's alive. Uh, and by the end of
[44:10] this service, oh, you don't hear me this
[44:12] morning. By the end of this service, uh,
[44:15] somebody's going to be alive. Uh,
[44:19] not
[44:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[44:24] Let me warn you this morning. I don't
[44:26] know what's going to happen, but God
[44:28] knows what's going to happen. And that's
[44:30] what excites me because he knows the
[44:32] beginning and he knows the ending. He
[44:34] knows what you're going through. And he
[44:36] said all things work together for good.
[44:39] To them that love God to them who have
[44:42] he called according to his purpose. Uh
[44:44] the fact that you are here this morning
[44:47] is evidence that you have been called
[44:49] according to his purpose. So why are you
[44:52] living under your privileges? Why the
[44:55] sad faces? Why the depressed faces? Why
[44:58] the poor me? No, it's not poor me. I
[45:03] am. Can the church say amen? You may be
[45:08] seated. It's good to see you in the
[45:10] house of the Lord. This is where you're
[45:13] supposed to be every Sunday. It's not
[45:15] supposed to be a pressure to come to
[45:17] church. You're supposed to be excited
[45:19] from Monday morning. You're supposed to
[45:21] be excited to come to church the next
[45:24] Sunday. What you could get here, your
[45:26] employer cannot give you. No bonus could
[45:29] give you, the news reporter cannot give
[45:32] you, the psychologist cannot give you,
[45:35] the doctor cannot give you, a movie
[45:38] cannot give you, a book cannot give you,
[45:40] a friend cannot give you. This is
[45:43] eternity. This is eternal. Everything
[45:45] else is temporary. Everything else will
[45:48] come to an end. So, we are here to
[45:50] partake of eternity this morning. We're
[45:53] here to eat mana, hidden mana from under
[45:56] the seventh seal, fresh food this
[45:58] morning so we could continue along the
[46:03] journey. Why? Because he who started the
[46:06] work in you is more than able to bring
[46:08] it to pass. You may be
[46:10] seated. Do you understand? It's not your
[46:13] ability. It's not your strength.
[46:19] It's not your achievement. Brother
[46:21] Brandham said if it's anything to
[46:22] happen, it wouldn't even be your prayer.
[46:24] It'll be the grace
[46:26] of God. No wonder the headstone will
[46:29] come with shouting crying grace. When
[46:32] they wrote me off, there was grace. When
[46:35] they said I couldn't make it, there was
[46:37] grace. When the doctor gave up on me,
[46:40] there was grace. When my neighbors gave
[46:42] up on me, there was grace. It is grace
[46:45] to serve the
[46:47] Lord. Grace in your trial, grace in your
[46:51] testing, grace when you have no money,
[46:54] grace when you're feeling sick, it's
[46:56] still the grace of God. You may be
[47:00] seated. So, I'm under great expectation
[47:03] this morning. And every day, my ex my
[47:06] excitement grows. Amen. Amen. Amen. to
[47:10] realize that we are one day closer to
[47:12] the rapture. Yes, sir. One day closer to
[47:15] the resurrection,
[47:17] one day closer to seeing believers who
[47:19] we don't see anymore because they are
[47:20] waiting on us. They're not dead. They're
[47:22] waiting on us. They are just sleeping.
[47:25] They are waiting with a time when we
[47:26] could reunite again.
[47:29] I'm on the expectation for a visitation
[47:31] to the young people. And it's good to
[47:33] see so many young people here this
[47:35] morning because God promised a
[47:38] visitation. He promised to give you a
[47:40] charge, an anointing, an experience with
[47:43] God that a book cannot give you, a
[47:45] professor cannot give you, a mentor
[47:47] cannot give you. It's an experience on
[47:50] the inside. I'm under expectation for
[47:53] dynamics. I'm under expectation for
[47:55] power because we have had word upon
[47:58] word, line upon line, precept upon
[48:01] precept for years. But what we need is
[48:03] this word to come alive. And brother
[48:05] Brandham said, "One day the right words
[48:07] will be spoken and something is going to
[48:10] happen and somebody somewhere will dash
[48:13] into the presence of almighty God. May
[48:16] this day be your
[48:19] [Applause]
[48:20] day, backsliders being restored.
[48:24] To him that overcome it will I make a
[48:26] pillar in my house, a pillar in my
[48:30] temple." And the Bible said you'll go no
[48:32] more out. So there comes a point in your
[48:35] walk with God where there is no thought
[48:37] of backsliding. There is no thought of
[48:39] going back to the the ability, the
[48:41] desire, the the the the weaknesses that
[48:43] you feel will no longer exist because
[48:45] there's an anchor that holds in spite of
[48:48] the storm. He didn't say the storms
[48:50] would stop coming, but the anchor is
[48:52] going to hold despite of the storm. He
[48:55] didn't say the winds would not get
[48:57] contrary, but the anchor will hold
[49:00] despite the windsh blowing you this way
[49:02] and blowing you that way. And when it
[49:05] looks as if all hope is gone, the anchor
[49:07] is going to hold.
[49:09] Can the church say, "Amen."
[49:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, are you
[49:15] happy this morning? So, as excited as I
[49:18] am, God is more excited.
[49:21] Hallelujah. Because he's been looking
[49:22] for this day for a long time. until you
[49:25] like the prodigal son could come to your
[49:28] senses
[49:31] because that's something only you could
[49:32] do you know only you could come to your
[49:34] senses your neighbor the pastor cannot
[49:37] come to his senses for you or your
[49:39] senses for you there's no such thing but
[49:42] you have to come to your senses to
[49:45] realize that there's more in you than
[49:47] you realize to realize there's more for
[49:49] you than against you to realize that you
[49:51] have been predestinated for such a time
[49:54] is this. Can the church say amen?
[49:57] So, I have a title this morning. I was
[49:58] just testing the temperature
[50:01] to see who's here, you know, and people
[50:03] who are absent from the body but not
[50:06] present with the Lord. They're just
[50:07] sitting there. So, I want to make sure
[50:09] everybody is here and on their post of
[50:12] duty with their swords drawn because we
[50:14] are in spiritual warfare. Amen. So my
[50:17] title this morning is taken from
[50:21] the first verse of Revelation 4. My
[50:25] title is come up hither.
[50:28] And my subject the voice of God and my
[50:32] inspiration the
[50:34] voice of deliverance.
[50:37] Can the church say amen? So God is going
[50:40] to have a bride. I just want to lay a
[50:42] foundation before I get to my text. And
[50:44] that bride will be a word bride. Amen.
[50:48] There has never been a bride like this
[50:50] bride. And there will never be one like
[50:51] this bride. And what's about to happen
[50:54] could not have happened before because
[50:57] in the back part of his mind, he saw it
[50:59] all play out. And God could afford to
[51:02] look and sit back and not watch it
[51:04] unfold because brother Brandham said God
[51:07] could tie up the devil anytime.
[51:11] And that's what God has done. He has
[51:12] really tied up the devil because the
[51:14] devil can only see at a certain level.
[51:16] But God is watching your victory and
[51:18] he's smiling because it looks like
[51:20] you're not going to make it. And you
[51:22] know who? Who? He who have the last
[51:24] laugh the best.
[51:28] God is looking smiling saying he he's
[51:31] already made it. He's already overcome.
[51:34] Because that's what fornowledge does. He
[51:36] knows the end before the beginning.
[51:38] That's why he wrote your name in blood.
[51:42] And there's no eraser. There's no liquid
[51:45] paper. There's no backspace button.
[51:48] There's no delete button. There's no
[51:50] mistake and the file gone missing. Your
[51:53] name has been written in blood.
[51:57] Can the church say amen?
[52:00] So the Holy Spirit today, the
[52:02] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[52:04] angel trying to get the people back to
[52:07] the word. Amen. Because the Holy Spirit
[52:10] will only vindicate a word. And that's
[52:13] why I challenge you in your daily walk
[52:15] to apply the token. But the Brandham
[52:17] said is to apply every word.
[52:21] Don't just hear the message or say I
[52:23] believe the message, but apply every
[52:26] word to your life. Apply it to your
[52:29] house. When it looks as if nothing is
[52:31] changing, apply it anyway because that's
[52:34] your responsibility. You got to say,
[52:36] "I'm going to be filled. my son is going
[52:39] to be restored. That's applying the
[52:41] token to your life because full
[52:43] obedience to every word of God will
[52:46] entitle you to the token. Can the church
[52:48] say amen?
[52:51] And that word will defeat the enemy any
[52:53] place, any time, under any condition.
[52:57] Can the church say amen? So wonderful.
[53:02] So we read the
[53:03] scripture about
[53:06] John having an experience with
[53:09] God. And John is very interesting
[53:12] because the more I find myself in the
[53:15] scripture, I find it's it's so powerful
[53:17] what is said and what is not said. And
[53:18] when you really go deeper, when you look
[53:20] at David and you look at Caleb and you
[53:22] look at through the Old and the New
[53:24] Testament, the experiences that these
[53:27] men of God had gone
[53:29] through. And this book of Revelation, I
[53:32] believe, was written over a period of
[53:33] about 3 years. And John found himself on
[53:37] the aisle of Patmos. Found himself in
[53:40] exile because they didn't know what to
[53:43] do with him.
[53:46] Amen.
[53:47] They tried boiling him in oil and they
[53:49] couldn't kill him.
[53:52] They tried throwing him out and doing
[53:53] this to him. But the Brandham said they
[53:55] call him a witch, but that didn't stop
[53:56] him.
[53:58] And after about 62 years after the
[54:00] crucifixion, he is banished to the aisle
[54:03] of Patmos with with criminals because
[54:05] it's a exile island where where the
[54:08] worst of the criminals find themselves.
[54:11] He was not like the others. He wasn't
[54:13] there for robbery. He wasn't there for
[54:14] killing somebody. He wasn't there. But
[54:16] the Bible said he was there for the word
[54:18] of God and the testimony of Jesus
[54:20] Christ. What a reason to be in prison.
[54:23] What a reason to be in exile. The Bible
[54:26] didn't tell us if there were other
[54:27] brothers to encourage him. If he had a
[54:29] prayer group, but what we know, he was
[54:31] there by himself and and he's struggling
[54:34] because it's not easy. He wasn't on a
[54:36] couch or a hammock, but in that exile
[54:38] state, he would have been working. It
[54:40] would have been a hard experience. It
[54:42] would have been a tough experience. It
[54:44] would have been a rugged place.
[54:47] I don't know if he had a day off or not,
[54:49] but the Bible said it was the Lord's
[54:51] day.
[54:53] And he was in the spirit of the Lord's
[54:55] day. His prison didn't stop him from
[54:58] being in the spirit. His prison didn't
[55:00] stop him from worshiping. His prison
[55:02] didn't stop him for recognizing that it
[55:05] was the Lord's day. He might have had a
[55:08] hard day before, but that didn't change
[55:10] the fact that he was in the Lord's day.
[55:13] Can the church say amen?
[55:16] Blessed be the name of Is everybody with
[55:18] me this morning. So your situation, your
[55:21] circumstance, your problem, your trial
[55:23] is no excuse.
[55:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And while he was
[55:29] there, the Bible said he heard a voice
[55:31] say, "Come up hither." And when John
[55:34] heard that voice, the Bible says
[55:36] immediately, hallelujah, he was in the
[55:39] spirit. I want to drop off something to
[55:41] you this morning. It's one thing when
[55:44] you're in the spirit because you pray it
[55:45] up and you're in the spirit because
[55:46] you're in the word. But when you hear
[55:48] that voice speak to you directly,
[55:51] immediately you get in the spirit, you
[55:54] can't put it on. It's it's not a show.
[55:57] It has nothing to do with anybody else.
[55:59] But there's power in that voice. And if
[56:02] that voice he said it was the first
[56:03] voice, it was the same voice he heard in
[56:06] in Revelation 1. It was the same voice.
[56:08] And that voice said, "Come up, Heather.
[56:10] John, I know you have the Holy Ghost,
[56:13] John. I know you are chosen, John. I
[56:15] know you're anointed, but I got
[56:17] something more to show you. I got
[56:19] something higher to show you. So come up
[56:21] hither. Come above your situation. Come
[56:24] above your problem. Don't exist down
[56:27] there, the aisle of Patmos. I don't want
[56:29] to talk to you when you're down there in
[56:31] your dumps. You come up here. Come up
[56:33] hither. Raise up. Get shake yourself up.
[56:36] Come up hither. I got something I want
[56:38] to show you. I can't show you when
[56:40] you're in your pity party. I can't show
[56:42] you when you're focused on your family.
[56:44] I can't show you when you're focused on
[56:46] the job. So, come up hither. Can the
[56:48] church say amen?
[56:51] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh,
[56:55] hallelujah. There's John by himself.
[56:58] John has nobody with him. He is there in
[57:01] isolation. He is forsaken. He is alone.
[57:05] He is in exile. There's nobody say,
[57:08] "Come on, John. You can make it." John
[57:10] is there by himself, but he doesn't
[57:11] forget who he is. He is there by himself
[57:15] and he doesn't forget where he comes
[57:16] from. John is there by himself. And
[57:18] while he's there working, I'm sure he
[57:21] could remember hearing Jesus in Matthew
[57:23] 16 saying, "Who do men say that I am?"
[57:26] John is there, but he's connected to who
[57:28] he is because nothing could shake him.
[57:30] Brother Brandham said God had to allow
[57:33] John to reach into that condition for us
[57:36] to have a book of revelation. So if God
[57:39] will let John go through that hard trial
[57:42] for us to have a book of revelation so
[57:44] we could know what's about to happen.
[57:46] What do you think God will do for you
[57:48] and your family? What will God pass you
[57:51] through? You don't hear me this
[57:54] morning. If you may be seated.
[57:58] And John, if you could dare say,
[58:03] you know, the Bible said, "Esau, Jacob,
[58:06] I love, Esau, I hate
[58:08] it." God is sovereign. He could do
[58:11] whatever he wants. But out of all the
[58:13] disciples, we hear a lot about Peter and
[58:16] Peter's faith. But John was the one they
[58:18] said Jesus loved.
[58:22] Amen. In fact, his love for John was so
[58:25] much that the disciple asked, "What will
[58:28] happen to this
[58:29] one called John?" And Jesus said to
[58:33] them, "What is it to thee
[58:36] if he tries until I come?" And those
[58:40] brothers say, "But wait, it look like
[58:41] John will never die." Jesus loved John
[58:44] so much. Just this John this and this
[58:47] same John God allowed him to be exiled,
[58:51] persecuted, bear the reproach of
[58:53] isolation, nobody to preach to, nobody
[58:56] to preach to him. He's in solitude. But
[58:59] many times God has to strip everything
[59:01] away from us to get our attention. And
[59:05] while John is there on the Lord's day, a
[59:07] voice says to his, "Come up here. I got
[59:10] to show you something that's about to
[59:12] take place." Can the church say amen?
[59:15] So, I want to encourage you something.
[59:17] No matter where you are right now,
[59:19] there's a higher place for you.
[59:21] No matter your position, how long you've
[59:24] been in a message, how long you've been
[59:25] a Christian, there's higher for you this
[59:27] morning. There's more power, there's
[59:30] more grace, there's more anointing,
[59:32] there's more filling, there's wave after
[59:35] wave after wave. So, I encourage you
[59:37] this morning to come up hither.
[59:41] John was being brought to a place he'd
[59:43] never been before. And in that place, he
[59:45] saw myriads of redeemed people. He was
[59:47] caught up. Uh he saw the throne room. Uh
[59:50] and he saw somebody on the throne. And
[59:52] he recognized that king on the throne.
[59:55] Can the church say amen?
[59:58] And brother Brandham, he typed it out in
[1:00:00] the book Revelation chapter 4, chapter
[1:00:03] 1, and chapter 2. And he speaks about
[1:00:05] after this, I looked and behold a door
[1:00:07] was open in heaven. And the first voice
[1:00:10] which I heard was as it were of a
[1:00:11] trumpet. He said that trumpet is the
[1:00:13] voice of God. It's a it's a voice of war
[1:00:16] saying come up hither. I will show thee
[1:00:18] things which must be hereafter.
[1:00:21] There was no secret God was given back
[1:00:23] from John. And the Bible said
[1:00:25] immediately I was in the spirit. And
[1:00:27] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:00:30] one sat on the throne. And brother
[1:00:32] Brandham said that everything was tied
[1:00:35] up in that room. that that throne room,
[1:00:39] he said it was lightning and thunders
[1:00:41] and flashings. He said it was not a
[1:00:43] throne of mercy. It was a throne of
[1:00:45] judgment.
[1:00:46] He said because at that point in time,
[1:00:48] it was after the church ages. But he
[1:00:51] said right now that throne has blood
[1:00:52] over it. So because of the blood on the
[1:00:55] throne, that throne is now a mercy seat
[1:00:58] that if you want mercy, you could go to
[1:01:00] the throne. But at that time because
[1:01:01] John represented a bride and John being
[1:01:05] called to come up hither was a type of
[1:01:07] the rapture. But before the rapture
[1:01:09] could take place there's blood.
[1:01:12] There's blood on the throne. There's
[1:01:14] mercy on the throne. Come all ye who are
[1:01:17] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[1:01:19] There's mercy for you. There's mercy for
[1:01:22] your family. Can the church say amen?
[1:01:26] You may be seated.
[1:01:28] Praise. Amen. On the throne. The Bible
[1:01:32] speaks about Jasper and Sardine. Speak
[1:01:34] about the throne and speak about the
[1:01:36] stone that speak about the types. And
[1:01:37] brother Brandham said you can run it
[1:01:39] through the scripture a few weeks ago
[1:01:41] when we were speaking about Caleb. We
[1:01:43] talked about how whenever those Hebrew
[1:01:45] mothers would give birth and say
[1:01:47] Ephrame and they would say their name,
[1:01:50] they were positionally placing
[1:01:53] that child in the promised land. Do you
[1:01:55] remember that? Amen. When Manasseh and
[1:01:58] and Judah and Simeon when the name was
[1:02:00] called, they were being cried out in
[1:02:02] birth pain.
[1:02:04] But not only were they being placed, but
[1:02:06] brother Brennham said that their birth
[1:02:08] also came with a stone.
[1:02:12] And that stone was going to represent
[1:02:14] every tribe. So the high priest when he
[1:02:17] had the
[1:02:18] urim, there were 12 stones which
[1:02:20] represented the 12 tribes. So whenever
[1:02:23] you have a prophecy or a dream, you
[1:02:25] bring it before the high priest and when
[1:02:28] you stood before the high priest and you
[1:02:30] prophesied or you told whatever
[1:02:32] experience you had, if it was of God, a
[1:02:35] supernatural light would flash over the
[1:02:38] urine from him and if all 12 stones lit
[1:02:42] up, then they knew it was of God. That
[1:02:45] was God's way of showing them that is of
[1:02:47] God. Can the church say amen? And
[1:02:49] brother Param said when John stood in
[1:02:51] the throne room and he's looking at this
[1:02:53] whole display of stuff that's about to
[1:02:56] happen, God was tying the Old Testament
[1:02:58] and the New Testament to beginning and
[1:03:01] the end. And he said Jasper and Sadine
[1:03:04] represented the stones from the old
[1:03:07] patriarchs from the firstborn to the
[1:03:10] last born. God was showing John that he
[1:03:13] is the alpha and he is the omega. He is
[1:03:16] the beginning. He is the ending. And
[1:03:18] John is standing there seeing emerald,
[1:03:21] seeing amber, seeing God's deity, seeing
[1:03:25] the
[1:03:26] 24, the four beasts and the 24 elders
[1:03:29] and seeing what's about to happen.
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:34] You may be seated. And brother Brandon
[1:03:36] been preaching these two messages. He
[1:03:38] said these messages are to stabilize
[1:03:40] you. It's not just to come to church and
[1:03:43] say I'm happy, I'm joyful. know it to
[1:03:44] stabilize you for you to understand that
[1:03:47] you are part of a royal priesthood
[1:03:49] that you are royal seeds of Abraham and
[1:03:52] if you are child of the king you have to
[1:03:54] walk like one you have to talk like one
[1:03:57] you have to be in the spirit you have to
[1:03:59] walk in the
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:02] spirit so I pray this morning the same
[1:04:05] voice that John heard that said come up
[1:04:08] hither that same voice will speak to
[1:04:10] your heart this morning it's the same
[1:04:12] voice that Lazarus heard It's the same
[1:04:14] voice that when the boat was rocking and
[1:04:17] Jesus was asleep and they thought they
[1:04:19] were going to die and they don't know
[1:04:21] what to do, they said, "Let's wake
[1:04:22] Jesus."
[1:04:24] The winds are contrary. All hell is
[1:04:27] against me. When they woke, Jesus, Jesus
[1:04:29] looked at them. What you worried about?
[1:04:32] Peace. Be still. And he turned back and
[1:04:35] went back to sleep. He didn't even
[1:04:37] wonder how it were going to work out
[1:04:39] because when he spoke, something has to
[1:04:42] happen. And the disciples asked
[1:04:44] themselves a question. What manner of
[1:04:47] man is this? We have never seen man like
[1:04:50] this before. No book has it. No
[1:04:53] encyclopedia has it. What manner of man
[1:04:56] is this that even the winds and the seas
[1:04:59] obey him? But it was that voice. It was
[1:05:02] that same voice that said, "Let there be
[1:05:04] light." That same voice is the voice
[1:05:07] that called John. That's the voice that
[1:05:09] called you because you couldn't be here
[1:05:11] this morning if the father didn't call
[1:05:14] you. He called your name and you
[1:05:17] answered.
[1:05:19] Can the church say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:05:23] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:05:32] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:34] Hallelujah. So you couldn't even be here
[1:05:37] this morning unless God called you. You
[1:05:40] couldn't be here this morning unless you
[1:05:42] heard your name because there are many
[1:05:44] people who want this. There are people
[1:05:46] who want to be free but they cannot be
[1:05:48] free because they are not predestinated
[1:05:50] to be free. There are people in
[1:05:52] denomination in churches having a form
[1:05:54] of godliness. They want to be in church.
[1:05:57] They are religious people but they are
[1:05:59] not predestinated. Their names have not
[1:06:01] been called uh but not you. Your names
[1:06:03] have been called out. Brother Brandham's
[1:06:06] message, a shout message, was to call
[1:06:08] names. His message was a message of name
[1:06:11] calling. And whenever you hear your
[1:06:13] name, uh, there's got to be something on
[1:06:15] the inside that has to
[1:06:18] respond. You may be seated. Oh,
[1:06:21] hallelujah.
[1:06:23] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Have you
[1:06:25] ever been walking down the street and
[1:06:27] somebody call a name, but it sounds like
[1:06:31] your name? Maybe you don't know who they
[1:06:33] are, but but maybe Anthony, you're
[1:06:34] walking down the street and hear
[1:06:35] somebody say Tony and you look around
[1:06:37] and and you're wondering if it's you,
[1:06:38] but there's another person that they're
[1:06:40] calling. But it's something inside of
[1:06:42] you. You have to respond because since
[1:06:44] you know yourself, you have responded to
[1:06:46] that name. Well, that's what's going on
[1:06:48] this morning. Whenever we hear
[1:06:52] adoption, whenever you hear
[1:06:56] perfectionist, whenever you hear the
[1:06:58] Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost, but that's that's the only name.
[1:07:02] And overcomer, you turn around. You got
[1:07:05] to be talking about me more than a
[1:07:07] conqueror. Who's calling my name? Who's
[1:07:10] calling my name this morning? Son of the
[1:07:13] king. That's high priest.
[1:07:17] Can the church say amen? Am I talking to
[1:07:20] anybody this morning? Do you recognize
[1:07:23] who you are? That's why the problem said
[1:07:25] the moment the bride recognizes who she
[1:07:28] is, it'll be a national showdown. The
[1:07:30] devil is
[1:07:33] finished. Every word, every promise,
[1:07:37] every promise in the book is
[1:07:39] mine. You may be seated. So I want to
[1:07:42] challenge you. It's so powerful because
[1:07:45] the Bible said life and death is in the
[1:07:48] power of the tongue. I don't want you
[1:07:49] answer to high blood pressure no more.
[1:07:52] Don't answer to diabetes no more. Don't
[1:07:55] answer to fei. That's not your name.
[1:07:58] Don't answer to being tired. I am
[1:08:00] depressed. You do. You can't say that.
[1:08:02] That's not your name. I'm backslitten.
[1:08:05] That's not your
[1:08:07] name. Who are you? Who are you this
[1:08:10] morning? You are not Jacob. You are
[1:08:13] Israel. That's who you are. Maybe you
[1:08:16] didn't know it, but it's time we
[1:08:19] recognize who we
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:24] are.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:08:31] I'm an overcomer. I am more than a
[1:08:34] conqueror. I am victorious. Uh I am
[1:08:37] healed. Uh my son is delivered. Speak it
[1:08:40] present tense. We have gone past will
[1:08:43] be. We are speaking it as it was.
[1:08:45] Lazarus come forth. It's not a question.
[1:08:48] It's not a request. It's a command
[1:08:50] because we know who we
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:54] are. Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:08:58] What's happening this morning? We are
[1:09:00] climbing higher. We are responding to
[1:09:02] the word come up hither. Come out of
[1:09:04] your condition. Come out of your sin.
[1:09:07] Come out of condemnation. come out of
[1:09:09] your past. You may be see that it's
[1:09:11] messages like these. The prophet would
[1:09:14] speak and people would, you know what,
[1:09:15] put down their wheelchair because he
[1:09:17] would speak to them and they'd realize,
[1:09:19] wait a minute, this sickness is not my
[1:09:22] name. It's not who I am. This lust, this
[1:09:25] demon, this spirit, that's not who I am.
[1:09:28] House of hell, give way to the name of
[1:09:30] Jesus.
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:36] Hallelujah.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] My John, a type of the
[1:09:45] bride. Amen. Is there in a throne room
[1:09:49] and we have an appointment with the
[1:09:50] throne room to him that overcome it will
[1:09:54] sit with me in my throne. You are part
[1:09:57] of him as much as he is part of you. How
[1:10:00] could my hand be upset to the rest of my
[1:10:02] body? It's a part of me. It's an
[1:10:03] extension of who I am. You might see my
[1:10:07] face, but my hand is still my hand. And
[1:10:09] you might think you are the least part
[1:10:10] of the body, but you are part of the
[1:10:12] body. And wherever the body goes, you
[1:10:14] have to
[1:10:15] go. You don't hear me this morning. So
[1:10:18] if my foot is giving trouble, he can't
[1:10:20] say, "I'm staying here." And the rest of
[1:10:22] the body is going here. So even if I
[1:10:25] have to use a crutches or use a sling,
[1:10:28] you're still going. I don't think you
[1:10:30] got that yet. Amen.
[1:10:33] Amen. It doesn't matter what's go. If
[1:10:36] you had a little finger in the body
[1:10:37] that's giving trouble this morning,
[1:10:38] you're still going because you cannot
[1:10:41] even separate yourself from the body if
[1:10:43] you wanted to. So the rest of us, we are
[1:10:46] carrying you because you are part of the
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:51] So there are some little fingers in here
[1:10:53] this morning. They don't think they are
[1:10:54] much in their little pain, little
[1:10:56] trials. But you know what? You're still
[1:10:58] going because the head, Christ himself,
[1:11:02] has taken property, has taken ownership,
[1:11:05] have taken command of the body, and the
[1:11:07] body has got to go wherever the head
[1:11:09] goes. He is head of the church. Christ
[1:11:12] is head of the church.
[1:11:14] You may be seated.
[1:11:18] This position, this place this morning
[1:11:20] that we have reserved for us, we have
[1:11:23] not or cannot obtain it by good works.
[1:11:26] It's not merit. I'm not standing here by
[1:11:29] merit. I'm not standing here by works.
[1:11:31] I'm standing by the grace of God. And I
[1:11:34] stand here because it's been purchased
[1:11:36] by the blood of Jesus. It has been paid
[1:11:39] for. I am property of somebody. I belong
[1:11:42] to somebody. That's why when the devil
[1:11:45] touches me, he has to get permission to
[1:11:47] touch me because I don't belong to him.
[1:11:49] He has to get permission. A permission
[1:11:52] slip. Can I mess with Isaac? Can I mess
[1:11:55] with brother George? Can I try him and
[1:11:58] see what he's made of? And you know what
[1:12:00] God does? No
[1:12:02] problem because he's just like Job.
[1:12:06] He's just like
[1:12:07] Job. Try him. Take away what you want
[1:12:10] from him.
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:19] You may be seated.
[1:12:21] When you really look at Job, brother
[1:12:23] Knights, it's really a perplexing
[1:12:25] situation, you know, because God start
[1:12:27] the whole thing, you know.
[1:12:33] God start the whole thing. He say,
[1:12:35] "Satan, where are you?" He say walking
[1:12:38] to and fro, just up and down. You know,
[1:12:41] when you have a child, it just got sit
[1:12:42] still. Just run in here, there, move
[1:12:44] this, touch this, pull this down. Come,
[1:12:46] come, come, come, come, come. Look. Have
[1:12:48] you considered
[1:12:50] terrorizing,
[1:12:54] bothering, stressing out this man called
[1:12:57] Job,
[1:13:03] I thought about it. No, but when I look
[1:13:05] at the hedge, when I look at the
[1:13:07] protection, when I look at the
[1:13:09] anointing, when I look at the way Job
[1:13:11] walks and the way Job talks and Job's
[1:13:15] prayer life and the way Job encourages
[1:13:18] himself. Amen. I tell myself, "Not that
[1:13:20] one."
[1:13:24] So when the nights God say, "All right."
[1:13:26] Amen. I'll remove the hedge. I'll remove
[1:13:29] the protection. Go touch him. Just don't
[1:13:31] touch his life. Do what you want to him.
[1:13:33] And I can imagine God smiling. Am I
[1:13:35] ready yet? They know my son Jojo. God is
[1:13:38] boasting because he's proud. No matter
[1:13:41] what the pressure is, you lose the car,
[1:13:43] you lose five tires, and you're driving
[1:13:45] on on iron.
[1:13:49] You're still smiling. The point was why
[1:13:52] why you smiling? You have no idea.
[1:13:55] Though he slay me yet still
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:14:06] like Hallelujah. And you know like your
[1:14:09] notifications on your phone. Hallelujah.
[1:14:11] You get one email, you get a WhatsApp,
[1:14:12] you get a text, you get everything.
[1:14:14] One after the next they bring in the
[1:14:16] report for Job. Animals, your children,
[1:14:19] the farm, the truck break down, the bank
[1:14:22] account frozen, the credit card not
[1:14:24] working, the M strip not working, you
[1:14:26] can't pay for this, you can't do that,
[1:14:28] you can't the doctor cancel every
[1:14:34] and God is smiling because his strength
[1:14:38] is made perfect
[1:14:41] in our weakness.
[1:14:45] Because when you think it's about you,
[1:14:46] it's about him. That's why he said for
[1:14:49] his name's sake. You see, God doesn't
[1:14:52] play with his name in them. You see,
[1:14:54] years ago, there were no written
[1:14:55] contracts. There were no written, there
[1:14:57] were no lawyers who would say sign here
[1:14:59] and sign here. Your name was your bond.
[1:15:01] So when you tell somebody, I will buy
[1:15:04] that land. That was the contract. Your
[1:15:06] word was your bond. And because you want
[1:15:09] to protect your word, which is your
[1:15:11] name, you would make everything happen
[1:15:13] to make that transaction happen. And God
[1:15:16] is very old school.
[1:15:19] So when he says, "I'm going to deliver
[1:15:21] you for his name's sake," he's going to
[1:15:23] do
[1:15:25] it. When he said you're going to get the
[1:15:28] Holy Ghost for his name's sake, because
[1:15:30] he can't lie and he he never did it and
[1:15:33] he can't start now. So when he said
[1:15:35] you're going to be adopted for his
[1:15:37] name's sake,
[1:15:41] he has got to do it. Can the church say
[1:15:44] amen?
[1:15:47] Hallelujah. So we are predestinated
[1:15:50] friends to climb higher from faith all
[1:15:53] the way to charity. Can the church say
[1:15:55] amen? Come up hither.
[1:15:58] Predestinated until such a time as this.
[1:16:01] God allowed you to come into your
[1:16:03] family, come into your neighborhood, go
[1:16:06] through the school you went through, go
[1:16:07] through the jobs you went through, meet
[1:16:09] the people that you met, all of that to
[1:16:12] bring you to a spot for you to climb
[1:16:13] higher, to climb out of your condition.
[1:16:17] Can the church say amen? Remember
[1:16:19] Abraham said in the message revelation
[1:16:21] chapter 4 in part one he said this
[1:16:24] fourth chapter is right after the le the
[1:16:27] leotian church age and he said the
[1:16:29] leotardian church is the most messed up
[1:16:31] church age of every age. He said you
[1:16:34] know why because this church that was
[1:16:37] supposed to be Christ church put Jesus
[1:16:39] outside
[1:16:41] of the
[1:16:42] church.
[1:16:44] Could you imagine you build something
[1:16:46] and it's yours and your people put you
[1:16:48] out
[1:16:50] in the business world? Steve Jobs
[1:16:52] started Apple company and for years
[1:16:54] Apple was being built. It wasn't going
[1:16:56] too well. Then they throw him out the
[1:16:58] company and they tried for years and
[1:17:01] they recognized they need to bring him
[1:17:02] back in. And it's only when they brought
[1:17:04] him back in the company did better than
[1:17:06] it ever did before. And here it is.
[1:17:08] Jesus builds his church inaugurated on
[1:17:11] the day of Pentecost. And through the
[1:17:13] passage of time by the Leodysian church
[1:17:16] age, he is not invited
[1:17:18] into the church. He meets a closed door
[1:17:23] and he is forced to say, "Behold, I
[1:17:25] stand at the door and knock."
[1:17:29] And if any man would open, I will come
[1:17:32] and suck with him.
[1:17:36] And after that passage, brother Brandham
[1:17:38] said, "Here we find John in chapter 4.
[1:17:43] dealing with the God of heaven being put
[1:17:45] out of his own church.
[1:17:49] John on the aisle of Patmos as it
[1:17:52] were 30 mi from the coast about 15 miles
[1:17:57] roundabout and it was an exile for the
[1:17:59] Romans to put prisoners out there. But
[1:18:01] the B said and John was out there for
[1:18:03] what? What did he do? Did he steal
[1:18:05] something? No. They put him out there
[1:18:07] because he was disturbing the people of
[1:18:08] doing something evil. No, he was there
[1:18:10] for the word of God. and his testimony
[1:18:13] for preaching the gospel.
[1:18:17] Make let that be your testimony that you
[1:18:21] are persecuted because you stood for the
[1:18:23] gospel. You stood for the truth. You
[1:18:26] stood for what is right. Can the church
[1:18:27] say amen?
[1:18:31] And begin the fourth chapter. After
[1:18:33] this, I looked and behold, a door was
[1:18:34] open in heaven. And the first voice
[1:18:36] which I heard was as it were a trumpet
[1:18:38] talking with me which said come up
[1:18:40] hither and I will show thee things which
[1:18:42] must be
[1:18:44] hereafter. And brother Brandon said
[1:18:45] we're going to take it verse by verse.
[1:18:47] He said I got a lot of scriptures here
[1:18:49] that I want to get to you. He said and
[1:18:52] all this from hereafter now will be
[1:18:54] pertaining will take place on earth
[1:18:57] after the rapture of the
[1:18:59] church. Amen.
[1:19:02] You see after the rapture, this is going
[1:19:04] back now to pick up Israel after the
[1:19:06] church age, after the ages of the
[1:19:08] church.
[1:19:10] And then he goes on to talk about the
[1:19:12] marriage of the lamb in this great
[1:19:13] wedding. Let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:19:15] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:19:17] the lamb has come and his wife hath made
[1:19:19] herself ready.
[1:19:21] So, brother Brandham is using all of
[1:19:23] this to create a sense of urgency and as
[1:19:25] preached last week, it's later than we
[1:19:27] think. Amen.
[1:19:29] Amen. And we must know exactly where we
[1:19:32] stand because if we don't because
[1:19:34] brother taught us teaching places the
[1:19:36] believer. So you have to understand your
[1:19:39] position. Understand where we are at so
[1:19:42] you know what you need to do.
[1:19:46] And brother said, "Blessed are they
[1:19:47] which are called to the marriage supper
[1:19:49] of the lamb."
[1:19:52] There's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:19:53] one of these days in that sweet, sweet
[1:19:56] by and by. Just stay ready. Keep
[1:19:58] yourself ready. Purge your heart from
[1:20:00] all evil thinking. Have faith in God. No
[1:20:02] matter how dark it looks, how many
[1:20:05] laughs and makes fun and says you're
[1:20:07] making a mistake. Keep right on living
[1:20:10] holy and living for God. Just keep more
[1:20:13] moving on. The hour will arrive.
[1:20:16] [Applause]
[1:20:21] Brother Brandham said that John saw that
[1:20:24] door and brother begin to type it. He
[1:20:27] said, "Behold, I've set before thee an
[1:20:29] open door that no man can shut."
[1:20:31] Hallelujah. And no man could open. No
[1:20:34] preacher could shut it and no preacher
[1:20:36] could open it because that door is
[1:20:38] Christ. He says, "I am the door to the
[1:20:41] sheepfold." And the Bible said that door
[1:20:44] is the Holy Ghost. He said there's only
[1:20:46] one door to the church of the living God
[1:20:48] and Jesus is that door. He said I am the
[1:20:50] door. I am the door to the sheepfold. I
[1:20:53] am the way. All right. Amen. Brother
[1:20:57] said he said this to the church age. He
[1:20:59] said it to the Methodist and they turned
[1:21:01] away and went into organization. But
[1:21:04] I've set before you an open door.
[1:21:08] He said I put an open door which is the
[1:21:10] Holy Spirit that by one spirit we are
[1:21:13] all baptized into one body which is
[1:21:16] Christ. Amen. He said that message
[1:21:18] before the Methodists. They turned it
[1:21:20] away. They come up to sanctification and
[1:21:22] they refuse the Holy Ghost. That open
[1:21:25] door. How do you get into Christ? By one
[1:21:27] spirit. The Holy Spirit which is Christ
[1:21:31] spirit. I want to nail it on. We have
[1:21:33] entered it not by hand shaking, not by
[1:21:36] sprinkling, but by one Holy Ghost
[1:21:39] baptism. We are all baptized into one
[1:21:42] body and made partakers of that body.
[1:21:46] Can the church say amen?
[1:21:48] So, brother Brandham is beginning to
[1:21:49] dramatize as he's laying out this
[1:21:51] message. He's making sure that they
[1:21:54] understand where he's coming from. Yes,
[1:21:56] sir. And he's saying John is in Patmos
[1:21:58] and he's caught up after the church ages
[1:22:01] has ceased and he hears a voice and he
[1:22:03] looks up towards heaven. He sees an open
[1:22:05] door and the first voice is a trumpet.
[1:22:09] That voice, brother Abraham said, is the
[1:22:11] same voice that walked in the seven
[1:22:13] golden candlesticks. It's the same voice
[1:22:15] that spoke of the church ages.
[1:22:19] Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:22:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:25] Amen. But the random goes on to speak
[1:22:28] about that door. And he said,
[1:22:30] listen, let me skip
[1:22:36] this. He said, "All right." He said, "I
[1:22:38] want you to notice the voice heard
[1:22:40] speaking to him had the clearness of a
[1:22:42] trumpet." You know how a trumpet sounds?
[1:22:44] It gives a shrill sound. What does a
[1:22:46] trumpet mean in the Bible? It means war.
[1:22:50] Anytime you see a trumpet blow in a war
[1:22:53] in the Bible time, it sounded meant a
[1:22:55] war. Either a revelation or something
[1:22:57] takes place. And after the church ages
[1:23:00] was over and everything was come ready,
[1:23:02] made ready the setting of the fourth
[1:23:04] chapter. The church ages was done. He
[1:23:07] had done left the earth sea. Remember
[1:23:09] the voice that spoke to him behind him
[1:23:11] in the seven golden scanner six the work
[1:23:14] is finished and now that same voice is
[1:23:16] speaking up in heaven. What was it he
[1:23:18] had done redeemed his people. Amen. His
[1:23:21] earthly work was finished and he was in
[1:23:24] glory calling to John come up hither. He
[1:23:26] said but the Bible said that makes me
[1:23:28] feel like shouting on the eve of the new
[1:23:30] year. Oh my there you are. See come up
[1:23:32] here. This is the setting of the great
[1:23:34] battle. Listen to how he describes it.
[1:23:38] The people that rejected God's message.
[1:23:41] Amen. Rejected the Holy Spirit. The
[1:23:45] messenger of the seven church ages. Who
[1:23:47] is the messenger of the seven church
[1:23:48] ages? The Holy Spirit is the messenger
[1:23:50] of the seven church ages. The one that
[1:23:52] had rejected this message of grace had
[1:23:55] nothing left but judgment. Oh, while he
[1:23:58] is making ready to pour out the plagues
[1:24:00] upon the earth now, he says, "Come up
[1:24:02] hither."
[1:24:04] So this message this morning of come up
[1:24:06] hither is not just for you to get into
[1:24:08] the spirit. It's really preparing you
[1:24:10] for that call that one day will say come
[1:24:12] up hither to call to the rapture to call
[1:24:15] to the resurrection. Is that what you're
[1:24:17] looking for this morning to get called
[1:24:19] out of this world before the terribel
[1:24:21] plague strike before the judgment
[1:24:23] strikes.
[1:24:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[1:24:28] Brother Brandham saying this scripture
[1:24:30] while he's making ready, listen
[1:24:32] carefully, to pour out the plagues upon
[1:24:34] the earth. Come up hither and I'll show
[1:24:37] you what's fixing to take place. Christ
[1:24:40] rejecting godless sinners. I'm going to
[1:24:42] pour out my wrath upon them. Watch the
[1:24:45] setting. Oh, as we go down through the
[1:24:47] night, you'll get more of this. We can't
[1:24:49] get everything in here. We have to keep
[1:24:50] referring from place to place. how it's
[1:24:53] going to be a terrible thing for those
[1:24:56] when the last trumpet sounds. When the
[1:24:59] last battle is fought, when the last
[1:25:00] sermon is preached,
[1:25:03] when the last song is sung and we stand
[1:25:07] at the judgment seat of Christ, you're
[1:25:09] going to be asked, "Why didn't you
[1:25:11] receive it?" All right? What did you do
[1:25:13] with the life that I give you? You'll be
[1:25:16] asked to give a reason. What then?
[1:25:18] You've heard me sing that song or tried.
[1:25:20] What then? What then? When that great
[1:25:23] book is open, what then? When the ones
[1:25:25] that reject the message will be asked to
[1:25:27] give a
[1:25:28] reason. What
[1:25:30] then? What is your excuse? What will
[1:25:33] your reason be? When you come to service
[1:25:36] after service and you hear the word, you
[1:25:39] hear the warnings. You hear about a
[1:25:41] throne room. You hear that it's a throne
[1:25:44] that a king sits on. It's a throne of
[1:25:46] judgment. And it's only because there's
[1:25:48] blood on the throne, there's mercy.
[1:25:50] Amen. Amen. But it'll not be mercy
[1:25:53] forever. Amen. And when mercy runs out,
[1:25:56] it runs out. He who is filthy,
[1:25:59] filthy still. He who is holy, holy
[1:26:02] still. A snapshot taken of your life.
[1:26:05] What will your excuse be? I was too
[1:26:08] tired. I was too busy. I thought I was
[1:26:11] okay. When the word this morning is
[1:26:14] saying, "Come up hither. Come higher
[1:26:16] than your situation. Climb out of your
[1:26:20] condition. Climb out of your condition.
[1:26:22] This
[1:26:24] morning, brother Brandham goes
[1:26:28] on. We'll be asked to give a reason.
[1:26:30] What then? Going to stand there just as
[1:26:34] certain as this book is written. You're
[1:26:37] going to stand there and be asked for a
[1:26:39] reason. Oh, it pays us, my brothers,
[1:26:41] sisters. It behooves us as sons and
[1:26:44] daughters of God to check up on
[1:26:46] ourselves every hour of the day.
[1:26:51] How many people are checking
[1:26:54] themselves every
[1:26:57] hour of today? What a
[1:27:01] challenge the amount of different things
[1:27:03] we check every hour of the day. But are
[1:27:07] we checking up on
[1:27:08] ourselves every hour of the day to make
[1:27:13] sure that we are ready for when he
[1:27:16] comes?
[1:27:18] I tell young people all the time, it's
[1:27:20] it's all right to get ready for school.
[1:27:22] It's all right to get ready to study,
[1:27:24] but don't mix that up with being ready
[1:27:27] for when he comes. Brother Brandham
[1:27:29] taught us live as he is coming tomorrow.
[1:27:32] Planned for 20 years. How many of us are
[1:27:34] really living if God were to come
[1:27:36] tomorrow, this evening in 2 hours?
[1:27:39] Or would we be caught with our work
[1:27:43] undone? Oh, it pains us, my brother,
[1:27:45] sister. It behooves us as sons and
[1:27:48] daughters of God to check up on
[1:27:49] ourselves every hour of the day. Paul
[1:27:52] said, "I die daily, yet I live, not I,
[1:27:55] but Christ lives in me." You see, be
[1:27:58] checked up because you don't know what
[1:28:00] hour you're going to be summoned to
[1:28:02] answer on
[1:28:04] high. So, brother Brandham is
[1:28:06] traumatized and he says, "So, the voice
[1:28:07] is speaking to John. John, come up
[1:28:10] here." And the Brandon goes, "And I
[1:28:12] showed you the church ages on earth.
[1:28:14] Now, come up here. I'm going to show you
[1:28:15] something take place." See, Christ had
[1:28:18] left earth already.
[1:28:20] So really what brother Brandham is
[1:28:22] showing here what John was experiencing
[1:28:25] was actually long in the
[1:28:27] future. And brother Brenam I'll see if
[1:28:29] we get to it later on he said when in
[1:28:31] Matthew 16 Jesus said to his disciple
[1:28:34] there are some among you that will not
[1:28:36] see death until you see the son of man
[1:28:38] coming.
[1:28:40] And then by Matthew 17, Peter, James,
[1:28:43] and John are there on Mount
[1:28:45] Transfiguration. And Jesus is standing
[1:28:47] there. And then Elijah comes and Elijah
[1:28:50] and there's Moses. And Moses is
[1:28:53] representing Brother Baron said, "For
[1:28:55] our day, the six ages that went past the
[1:28:58] sleeping saints." And Elijah is there
[1:29:00] representing the raptured saints.
[1:29:02] Hallelujah. And when they get the great
[1:29:04] revelation to build three tabernacles,
[1:29:06] they only see Jesus.
[1:29:08] Come on. Amen. Come on now. We're in the
[1:29:12] word now this morning. Put on your
[1:29:14] spiritual hats this morning. We're going
[1:29:16] somewhere. Amen. Amen. John was standing
[1:29:19] there. All right.
[1:29:21] And when Jesus told them, "What is it to
[1:29:24] thee if
[1:29:26] John would see me if I let him tarry
[1:29:30] until he sees me?" Here it is. But the
[1:29:31] Bible said in Revelation chapter 4, John
[1:29:34] is there seeing everything as a
[1:29:37] rehearsal. He is seeing the whole thing
[1:29:39] played out in front of him. He is seeing
[1:29:42] the church ages. He is seeing the
[1:29:44] rapture. He is seeing the
[1:29:46] judgment. What an experience.
[1:29:50] Caught up into the mind of Christ.
[1:29:53] Caught up into the spiritual realm to
[1:29:55] see everything unfold.
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:01] No wonder John could write the book of
[1:30:04] Revelation the way he did. Amen.
[1:30:08] Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] Hallelujah. Amen. And brother go say,
[1:30:14] "Listen, whenever that voice speaks to
[1:30:17] you, he's dramatizing. When you hear the
[1:30:19] voice of God speak to you, something
[1:30:21] happens." Oh, did it happen to you like
[1:30:23] that? It did to me. But when I said 31
[1:30:26] years ago, and I've never been the same
[1:30:28] since. Oh, will he said, "Come up to me
[1:30:31] all ye that labor and have laden and
[1:30:33] I'll give you rest." It changed me. Is
[1:30:35] that your testimony this morning? Amen.
[1:30:38] Amen.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise God.
[1:30:42] Don't be satisfied, friends. Hallelujah.
[1:30:45] With just coming to church. Don't be
[1:30:47] satisfied with just one experience.
[1:30:50] Don't get satisfied with just one touch.
[1:30:53] Don't get satisfied with one healing.
[1:30:55] There's more where that comes from.
[1:30:57] There's more grace where that come from.
[1:30:59] There's more anointing. There's more
[1:31:01] power. There's more experiences.
[1:31:04] And John immediately he was in the
[1:31:06] spirit. Friends, you could never get
[1:31:08] anything unless you are in the spirit.
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. And how do you get in the
[1:31:17] spirit? You respond to that voice. Amen.
[1:31:20] Many times brother Brandon would speak
[1:31:21] and it said respond. Hallelujah. He
[1:31:24] would say stand up. Claim your healing.
[1:31:26] But you have to respond. Do something.
[1:31:28] Even if you don't understand, respond.
[1:31:30] It's a sign of response. It's an action.
[1:31:33] Don't just sit there and say a nice
[1:31:35] service. You can get nice services all
[1:31:37] over. But when the word, the voice of
[1:31:39] God comes to you with clarity and calls
[1:31:41] you from your sin and calls you from
[1:31:43] your past and called you from your
[1:31:44] mistake. Let somebody say hallelujah.
[1:31:47] That's me.
[1:31:49] It has nothing to do with your feeling.
[1:31:51] It has nothing to do with what happened
[1:31:52] to you. But you are identified with the
[1:31:55] voice with that word of God concerning
[1:31:58] you. Amen. Can the church say amen?
[1:32:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And brother
[1:32:06] Brandham is dramatizing. I want you to
[1:32:07] understand. I want you pick from this
[1:32:09] for your own walk. God cannot. Brother
[1:32:11] Brandham said God will not come down to
[1:32:13] your level.
[1:32:16] He said you have to come up to God's
[1:32:18] level. And for you to climb higher, you
[1:32:20] have to let go all the weights in your
[1:32:22] life that are keeping you down.
[1:32:25] For some of us, it's our job. For for
[1:32:27] some of us, it's our excuses. Someone
[1:32:29] says our past is whatever it is. It
[1:32:30] doesn't matter what it is because each
[1:32:33] of us are different
[1:32:34] individuals. You got to know what it is
[1:32:36] in your life that's weighing you down.
[1:32:38] And you got to drop it
[1:32:40] today that you become so light that when
[1:32:43] the rapture comes, there's no hindrance.
[1:32:46] There's no obstacle. There's nothing
[1:32:48] stopping you. You're ready to go. Don't
[1:32:50] be so attached to your house, to your
[1:32:52] car, to your reputation, to no because
[1:32:56] you want to go somewhere. This world is
[1:32:58] destined to be destroyed. Heaven and
[1:33:00] earth will pass
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] away. I John, this same John is the one
[1:33:08] who saw that holy city.
[1:33:12] That same John saw the earth, saw the
[1:33:15] atmosphere being burnt up. The same John
[1:33:18] we are talking about saw that new city
[1:33:20] coming into view. That same John saw
[1:33:23] tens and thousand time thousands of
[1:33:26] worshippers
[1:33:28] saying holy, holy, holy. That same John
[1:33:31] saw the 24 elders draw down their
[1:33:34] crowns. That same John saw behold the w
[1:33:38] the life the wife of the lamb.
[1:33:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what are you
[1:33:47] saying? Preacher John, he saw you.
[1:33:50] Yes. Yes, he saw you. He saw you. He saw
[1:33:54] you in the rapture. He saw you in the
[1:33:57] wedding supper. He saw the things
[1:33:59] hereafter. So shake yourself this
[1:34:01] morning and climb higher. Climb higher
[1:34:05] and give God praise because you are
[1:34:07] going to make
[1:34:09] it. Oh my. Oh glory. You may be seated.
[1:34:16] I'm waiting to see that day for when the
[1:34:18] voice of God will speak to you and your
[1:34:20] testimony will be like John. The moment
[1:34:23] I heard the voice immediately I was in
[1:34:25] the spirit. There was nothing to stop me
[1:34:28] from being 100% in the spirit. I wasn't
[1:34:31] 90% in the spirit but immediately I
[1:34:34] forgot everything else around me. I
[1:34:36] don't know if John was working, if he
[1:34:37] was walking, if he was praying. But when
[1:34:40] that voice called his name immediately
[1:34:43] he was in the spirit bring us to that
[1:34:45] kind of a service where the voice of God
[1:34:48] the voice of the archangel where Christ
[1:34:50] himself would speak to your heart and
[1:34:53] immediately you'll be in the spirit.
[1:34:57] You may be seated and God could show you
[1:35:01] things
[1:35:03] because you'll never see it in your
[1:35:05] human spirit. You'll never see it in
[1:35:07] your carnal walk. You'll never see it if
[1:35:09] you're not in the spirit. If you're not
[1:35:11] in the spirit, it's just intellectual.
[1:35:13] It's just another scripture. That's
[1:35:15] another quote like most people in the
[1:35:17] message. But when you're in the spirit,
[1:35:19] all of a sudden, you get a joy. You get
[1:35:22] a peaceuh. You get an assurance because
[1:35:24] this flesh is carnal. This flesh is
[1:35:27] physical. This flesh is natural. But in
[1:35:29] the spirit, it's your theophony. It's
[1:35:32] who you really are. There's no pain in
[1:35:34] the spirit. There's no fear in the
[1:35:36] spirit. There's no doubt in the spirit.
[1:35:39] There's no sickness in the spirit.
[1:35:41] There's no depression in the spirit.
[1:35:43] It's your
[1:35:44] identification. Let us make man in our
[1:35:47] image, in our likeness. It's back to
[1:35:50] Genesis
[1:35:51] 1. Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[1:35:59] seated. That's why when you're in the
[1:36:01] house of God and you're in the spirit,
[1:36:03] you could have walked in here tired. But
[1:36:05] when you're in the spirit, all of a
[1:36:07] sudden, you can't explain it. The
[1:36:09] tiredness got to go because you are
[1:36:11] connecting to who you really are. Listen
[1:36:14] this morning, you are not seeing me. You
[1:36:16] are seeing a shell, but inside of the
[1:36:18] shell is the real me in the image of
[1:36:21] God. I'm from the God class. I'm a son
[1:36:24] of God. Angels are subject to my
[1:36:27] command.
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[1:36:45] may be seated. I'm not trying to work
[1:36:48] you up in the spirit. No. No. No. No.
[1:36:50] No. No. No. No. It's a little higher
[1:36:52] than that this morning. The word of God,
[1:36:55] the voice must get you in the spirit.
[1:36:58] The word has to get you in the spirit.
[1:37:00] The Pentecostals, they just make noise
[1:37:02] and in the spirit of what they in. This
[1:37:04] is different. This is the word divinely
[1:37:07] revealed, divinely interpreted food,
[1:37:11] spiritual food, rightly dividing in due
[1:37:14] season. Christ himself, the voice of the
[1:37:17] archangel speaking to your situation.
[1:37:19] When you hear that voice, immediately
[1:37:22] you get in the spirit.
[1:37:27] You may be seated. Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] Hallelujah. You may be seated. But I got
[1:37:34] to explain something to you. That's why
[1:37:36] I love about this because John is a type
[1:37:38] of the bride. But John is also an
[1:37:40] individual. God doesn't call the group.
[1:37:43] We we we we know this. We have been well
[1:37:45] taught. God is not about the group. He's
[1:37:46] about individuals. So it's all right if
[1:37:49] the person next to you hasn't heard it
[1:37:51] yet. But if you hear it, if you hear
[1:37:54] something this morning,
[1:37:57] If you hear, if you see your name this
[1:38:00] morning,
[1:38:03] this is not between you and the pastor,
[1:38:06] you and the minister, you and the elder.
[1:38:08] This is between you and God saying,
[1:38:10] "Almighty God, you mean to tell me you
[1:38:13] put my name on the lamb's book of life
[1:38:16] in my wretched condition. You saw me
[1:38:19] overcome. You saw me in the rapture. You
[1:38:22] saw my family. You saw me filled with
[1:38:24] the Holy Ghost. You saw me delivered.
[1:38:27] You saw demons flying out of my life.
[1:38:30] You saw the house of hell subject.
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:40] No wonder when John saw his name, uh, he
[1:38:43] said, "All in heaven, all on the earth,
[1:38:46] even the devils under the earth heard me
[1:38:48] shout because I saw my name. And because
[1:38:51] my name is written, I can be redeemed."
[1:38:54] Because my name is written, I can have
[1:38:57] power. Because my name is written, I can
[1:39:00] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:02] and fire.
[1:39:18] Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah.
[1:39:21] Hallelujah. I pray that by the end of
[1:39:25] this service, listen, you may be seated.
[1:39:28] For those of you who are battling with
[1:39:30] condemnation and your mistakes and your
[1:39:34] failures, listen, Jesus, when he started
[1:39:37] his ministry, he saw Peter, he said,
[1:39:40] "Come."
[1:39:41] [Music]
[1:39:45] And Peter dropped everything. That's
[1:39:46] right. And started to follow.
[1:39:50] He picked up Andrew. He picked up James.
[1:39:54] Even Matthew the tax collector who the
[1:39:56] brothers had a challenge but he said
[1:39:58] come. They looked at Matthew and well
[1:40:00] all right if Jesus call him you got to
[1:40:02] be good because Jesus is in a name
[1:40:04] calling business. Come come. John
[1:40:09] himself was told to come. But this call
[1:40:11] that John gets on the aisle of Patmos is
[1:40:14] not just a come. It's come
[1:40:16] up. And many of you you have come this
[1:40:18] far. You have come. You have come to the
[1:40:20] message. You have come to church. You
[1:40:22] have come to the revealed word. But I'm
[1:40:24] saying come up hither. He wants you
[1:40:27] where he is. Oh my. He don't want you
[1:40:30] come to church. He wants you to come to
[1:40:32] where he is because you are heavenly
[1:40:35] creatures. You are just like him.
[1:40:38] Attribute sons of God that
[1:40:42] rotated off of God.
[1:40:47] [Applause]
[1:40:50] Woo!
[1:40:52] Everybody feeling good? The devil is
[1:40:55] scared of you, brother Mike. He is
[1:40:57] trembling this morning because you are
[1:41:00] sons of God. Listen, you may be seated.
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:14] In the Bible, Amen. The Syrians had a
[1:41:19] conundrum whenever they were discussing
[1:41:22] strategy on how to take out
[1:41:25] Israel. For some reason, Israel seemed
[1:41:29] to know what's going on in the secret
[1:41:34] war chambers of the king. Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] And brother Shane, the king cannot
[1:41:39] understand because it was his inner
[1:41:41] circle he was talking to. He knew these
[1:41:44] men for a long time and he couldn't
[1:41:47] believe that one of these men would sell
[1:41:49] him out to the Israelites.
[1:41:52] Hallelujah.
[1:41:55] They launch a commission of inquiry and
[1:41:57] somehow they found out that there's a
[1:41:59] man in Israel called Elijah.
[1:42:03] And this man had the ability to move
[1:42:05] through space and time because that's
[1:42:08] what prophets do. That's
[1:42:14] You may be seated. Before the doctor's
[1:42:16] hand touches my wife, the tumor will go
[1:42:19] down. Space is not an issue. Distance is
[1:42:22] not a problem. Sister Hat right. I give
[1:42:25] you your two boys. Why? I'm a son of
[1:42:28] God. I don't want to hear about the
[1:42:30] problem, the trial, the
[1:42:33] situation. You may be seated.
[1:42:37] There's power here this morning. You
[1:42:39] feel it right.
[1:42:41] Demons are trembling this
[1:42:43] morning. We have backed the devil in a
[1:42:46] corner this morning. House of hell give
[1:42:49] way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:51] Christ. You may be seated.
[1:42:54] So the Assyrian and Assyrian army, they
[1:42:57] came to surround Elijah. Amen. And
[1:43:00] brother Andrew, he woke up that morning
[1:43:01] as is custom. Maybe he's having
[1:43:03] breakfast and he has a little young boy
[1:43:05] named Jazzy.
[1:43:08] All right. And as this boy looks
[1:43:09] outside, he sees the whole host of the
[1:43:11] army and he comes in panicking. Elijah,
[1:43:15] Elijah, the enemy is around us. And I
[1:43:18] can imagine Elijah is doing an omelette
[1:43:21] and he takes his time and he flips the
[1:43:24] omelette in slow
[1:43:27] motion because he has nothing to fear.
[1:43:30] You know many times in the Bible Jesus
[1:43:32] said, "Fear not. Fear not." Even in the
[1:43:36] book in the New Testament said, "For I
[1:43:38] am not giving you the spirit of fear,
[1:43:39] but of
[1:43:41] adoption." What are you afraid of?
[1:43:44] You're afraid you're not going to get
[1:43:45] well. Forget about it. You are going to
[1:43:47] be
[1:43:48] healed. What? What are you talking
[1:43:52] about? You may be seated.
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:00] It's something powerful when you watch a
[1:44:03] man who knows his position and knows his
[1:44:06] authority and knows what he's connected
[1:44:08] to.
[1:44:10] And I can imagine that that that you may
[1:44:12] be seated that little boy was wondering
[1:44:14] where is Elijah getting this confidence
[1:44:16] from.
[1:44:18] Hallelujah.
[1:44:20] And Elijah looked at he said,
[1:44:22] "Listen, Lord, open up this boy's eyes."
[1:44:26] And when this boy looked again the
[1:44:28] second time, he said, "But wait a
[1:44:31] minute, they are more for us than
[1:44:35] against
[1:44:37] us." You may be seated. I challenge you
[1:44:41] this morning to look at your situation
[1:44:44] for another time.
[1:44:47] I challenge you this morning to look at
[1:44:50] your problem for a second time. Lord,
[1:44:53] open up these people's eyes to see that
[1:44:55] there are more for us than against us.
[1:44:59] There's more for us than what's going on
[1:45:01] in your home. There's more for us than
[1:45:04] what's going on in your family. There is
[1:45:06] more for us than the sickness in your
[1:45:09] body. There is more for us than that
[1:45:12] thing you cannot break.
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:17] We are the warriors. We are the sons of
[1:45:19] God. We are the fighters this morning
[1:45:22] who want to fight for their families.
[1:45:24] Fight for the kingdom. Fight for the
[1:45:27] power of God. Where are the sons of God?
[1:45:30] Where are the elders? Where are the
[1:45:31] deacons? Where are the ministers? Where
[1:45:34] are the sons of God?
[1:45:46] If you may be seated.
[1:45:55] Listen, I want to drop something off to
[1:45:57] you. Amen. Those were
[1:46:00] angels that the servant saw
[1:46:04] and
[1:46:05] sons give instructions
[1:46:08] to angels.
[1:46:10] Because angels are servants, but sons
[1:46:13] are
[1:46:14] royalty. Sons are
[1:46:17] princes. Sons give
[1:46:19] commands. Sons give
[1:46:23] instructions. Oh, you don't hear me this
[1:46:25] morning. No wonder. But the pran could
[1:46:28] say, you may be seated right now. We lay
[1:46:30] hands on the sick.
[1:46:33] But when the sons are manifested
[1:46:37] one more time, you will command the
[1:46:40] demons because it's in our nature to
[1:46:43] command because we are just like our
[1:46:46] father. Let there be son stand still.
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:53] [Music]
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:46:58] Peace. Be still.
[1:47:01] You may be seated.
[1:47:03] So I want to challenge you this morning.
[1:47:06] They say
[1:47:07] practice makes perfect. So I want to
[1:47:11] challenge you to start to
[1:47:13] practice speaking the way you will be
[1:47:19] speaking. So I want you to begin to
[1:47:21] speak to your storms. Speak to your
[1:47:24] situations. Speak to your body. Speak to
[1:47:28] your house. Say like Joshua, as for me
[1:47:31] and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[1:47:34] Begin to speak to those demons in your
[1:47:37] house. They've got to go today. Serve
[1:47:40] them. Notice time is up. Time is
[1:47:48] up.
[1:47:49] Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. You may
[1:47:55] be seated.
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:02] John had experienced many things.
[1:48:06] John was a witness.
[1:48:09] When Jesus was preaching and the service
[1:48:12] ran kind of late, brother Benjamin, it
[1:48:14] was longer than normal and by that time
[1:48:16] all the shops were closed, high low was
[1:48:19] closed or massi stores or whatever it
[1:48:21] was was closed. And Jesus asked a
[1:48:23] question, what? We can't let the people
[1:48:25] go back hungry. There are no places
[1:48:27] open. It's too late to cook. He said,
[1:48:28] "What do you have?"
[1:48:32] And I can imagine a deacon come and say,
[1:48:34] "Listen, Jesus, we have five loaves and
[1:48:36] two fishes.
[1:48:38] And one of the anointed brothers say but
[1:48:40] what are these among so many
[1:48:46] Jesus had a experience with those
[1:48:48] brothers they seeing miracles and yet
[1:48:51] them brothers still they already catch
[1:48:53] really what going on and Jesus blessed
[1:48:56] it and he had tell him what's going to
[1:48:58] happen say just share it.
[1:49:00] I want to know the deacon who started
[1:49:01] sharing because he had the hardest job
[1:49:04] you know because he would have been
[1:49:05] looking at five loaves and two fishes
[1:49:09] seeing 5,000 and telling himself how do
[1:49:12] I start to share this but could you
[1:49:16] imagine he takes one piece and break it
[1:49:18] and when he breaks it is like the piece
[1:49:20] come back
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:24] he
[1:49:29] Could you imagine that experience?
[1:49:35] You may be seated. Could you imagine
[1:49:38] Peter and this you see
[1:49:41] and Jesus just there just watching
[1:49:46] just watching.
[1:49:48] John was there to experience that.
[1:49:51] John was there on the boat when Jesus
[1:49:54] was so tired. The Bible said that they
[1:49:56] carried him to the boat. And in the
[1:49:59] original Greek, brother Nathaniel, that
[1:50:00] word carry meant to physically lift. In
[1:50:03] other words, the God of creation was so
[1:50:06] physically tired, the disciples had to
[1:50:08] prop him up and literally carry him to
[1:50:11] the boat. So tired was he that when the
[1:50:15] storms came, he didn't even wake up.
[1:50:22] Amen. But yet when it became too hot to
[1:50:25] handle, they decided the only option was
[1:50:27] to wake Jesus.
[1:50:31] John was there when he saw that
[1:50:38] John was there in the garden of
[1:50:39] Gethsemane and he had fallen asleep with
[1:50:42] the rest of the brothers.
[1:50:46] Oh, how he loved Jesus and how Jesus had
[1:50:48] loved him. But within his own human
[1:50:51] frailty and his own human weakness and
[1:50:53] doing the very best that he could, the
[1:50:55] very best that he could do was not even
[1:50:58] good enough. And like the rest of
[1:51:00] brothers, he fell asleep. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:03] Hallelujah.
[1:51:05] But John was also there when he saw a
[1:51:08] resurrected Christ and for 40 days he
[1:51:11] heard Jesus open their understanding to
[1:51:14] the scriptures. All right. And he now
[1:51:16] possessed a clarity that he never had
[1:51:18] before because he had walked with Jesus,
[1:51:21] loved by Jesus. Undoubtedly, things
[1:51:24] would have been shared to him that only
[1:51:25] he was privy
[1:51:27] to and he was there in the upper room
[1:51:29] and the Holy Ghost poured out. But I
[1:51:32] want to challenge you, as great as all
[1:51:34] of that was, there was no experience
[1:51:38] like when he heard the words come up
[1:51:40] hither.
[1:51:42] Because for the first time, he's able to
[1:51:44] go straight up into the mind of God.
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:49] Because the Bible said, I want to read
[1:51:52] it carefully to you so you understand
[1:51:55] the context of what God allowed John to
[1:51:59] see to understand how deep it
[1:52:03] was. Come up here and I will show you
[1:52:06] the things which must be
[1:52:08] hereafter. And it's unfold to him things
[1:52:11] that are to be
[1:52:16] things concerning the bride. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:18] Things concerning your walk with God.
[1:52:20] And he has to hold all of that and watch
[1:52:23] it all unfold.
[1:52:25] Because God promised that somebody would
[1:52:27] see it. And it's written in here in
[1:52:30] secret for us for such a time as this.
[1:52:32] How blessed are we this morning,
[1:52:34] friends? Amen. So I want to challenge
[1:52:37] you friends as all of the experiences
[1:52:39] you have had in your journey to this day
[1:52:42] is nothing to be compared for that call
[1:52:45] to come up hither.
[1:52:48] To hear that voice call you from this
[1:52:50] state into another state. Amen. The
[1:52:53] rapture is on the inside and then what
[1:52:55] we have preached about becomes a reality
[1:52:57] to us that is mortal could put on
[1:53:00] immortality.
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:03] Amen. It sounds almost like a fairy
[1:53:06] tale, but it's going to happen. Friends,
[1:53:11] can the church say amen? Can the Lord
[1:53:14] give the Lord a hand of praise?
[1:53:17] Do you love the Lord this morning? Do
[1:53:19] you love the word this morning? You see
[1:53:21] how blessed we are?
[1:53:27] So, I want to kneel this down so you
[1:53:29] understand it clearly. But I'm in the
[1:53:30] same message. Revelation chapter 4 part
[1:53:33] 1 chapter 125. Oh, and notice John being
[1:53:37] taken up immediately after the church
[1:53:39] age was a type of the rapture church.
[1:53:43] Immediately after the church age is
[1:53:44] over. This leards and church age then
[1:53:47] comes the rapture. The church goes up
[1:53:49] like John did into the presence of God.
[1:53:53] Amen. But everybody said my that just
[1:53:56] wins my soul around caught up at the
[1:53:58] rapture of the church. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:54:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah. I'm getting ready to wind up
[1:54:07] in a short
[1:54:08] while, but the papa said no.
[1:54:20] You know, and in that same message, but
[1:54:22] said there's hope we don't run out of
[1:54:24] time too quick here now that we can get
[1:54:26] right into this.
[1:54:29] And we want to see how that flows into
[1:54:31] the human being. It's a beautiful story.
[1:54:33] Hallelujah.
[1:54:34] Jesus. So brother Brandham was given a
[1:54:37] type. He said some time ago and he's
[1:54:39] given a story. I want you to catch this
[1:54:41] now. A bunch of ministers Oral Roberts
[1:54:44] was one of them. Cecil be the mill when
[1:54:46] he wrote this ten commandments. I'm sure
[1:54:47] we've all seen ten commandments. He
[1:54:49] called up brother Shakarion, brother
[1:54:51] Roberts, many preachers across the land.
[1:54:54] any preachers that could come. And he
[1:54:56] invited them to come into the studio
[1:54:59] before the picture was ever released and
[1:55:02] let them see the rehearsal of it before
[1:55:05] it was ever showed out. When they were
[1:55:07] charging $25 a ticket, they seen the
[1:55:10] rehearsal of it that they might pass
[1:55:13] their opinion on whether there was any
[1:55:16] critics about it or what could be said
[1:55:18] and so forth. They seen it before the
[1:55:22] public. Amen. Could see it. Amen. All
[1:55:25] right. You catch that now? So when the
[1:55:26] ten commandments is made, Cesy Mill is
[1:55:28] finished. He he doesn't want to show it
[1:55:29] to everybody unless he gets some support
[1:55:32] from the preachers of the day. They say,
[1:55:33] "Brothers, come and look at this and
[1:55:35] tell me if you think this ten
[1:55:36] commandments really brings out the story
[1:55:38] of Moses and the Exodus and stuff. And
[1:55:41] the brothers come and they see a
[1:55:42] rehearsal of what takes place before the
[1:55:46] public sees what takes place. And
[1:55:50] brother Brandon begins to connect this
[1:55:51] to John now. So he said when Jesus says
[1:55:55] some of you standing here will not taste
[1:55:57] death until you see the Solomon coming.
[1:55:59] He said, "What Jesus was talking about
[1:56:01] is calling John aside and giving John a
[1:56:05] rehearsal of ten commandments or the
[1:56:08] unfolding of time before the bride was
[1:56:12] even here before the church age is even
[1:56:15] played out. So John was seeing it
[1:56:18] firsthand
[1:56:21] to give according to what brother said
[1:56:24] to see if there's any critics or opinion
[1:56:26] or or what is going to happen in the
[1:56:27] world to tell people you should go and
[1:56:29] see this thing man. This thing end up
[1:56:31] good. All right. This thing is a good
[1:56:33] thing to see. So John wrote out his
[1:56:36] testimony through the book of revelation
[1:56:39] of how good these things are that he saw
[1:56:41] when he was caught up. Amen. Amen. And
[1:56:44] in there he sees everything including
[1:56:46] the spirit and the bride say come.
[1:56:49] He sees and writes everything out. And
[1:56:52] he shows how the devil is going to be
[1:56:54] destroyed. He talks about the new city.
[1:56:56] So what's our excuse? Amen. That book of
[1:56:59] revelation is already happened in
[1:57:01] rehearsal.
[1:57:03] The tape is already recorded.
[1:57:06] It's only now. There's no more editing
[1:57:08] to the tape.
[1:57:10] I don't think you catch that. There's no
[1:57:12] more. The tape is finished, but it's
[1:57:14] even it's it's the movie is finished.
[1:57:17] The only thing going on now is it's now
[1:57:19] playing in the correct timing, but we
[1:57:23] know the end.
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:31] We already know the end of the story.
[1:57:34] And that's why Satan is mad
[1:57:38] because he can never change his part in
[1:57:40] the story.
[1:57:42] And that why you should be glad because
[1:57:44] nobody could take you out as a character
[1:57:47] in the story. In that story you are
[1:57:51] shouting in that story. But a terance
[1:57:54] there's no more arthritis.
[1:57:56] But a nicho in that story that foot has
[1:57:58] no more pain. Oh you don't hear me s
[1:58:02] sister Christine in that story those
[1:58:04] eyes open back up. That's that's on the
[1:58:07] tape. That is it's playing right now. is
[1:58:11] going to get to the part where you get
[1:58:12] the Holy Ghost. It's going to get to the
[1:58:14] part where your husband is get
[1:58:16] delivered. It's going to come to the
[1:58:17] part where your wife gets
[1:58:19] delivered. But the Ruskin is going to
[1:58:21] come to the part where you are healed.
[1:58:24] Oh yes. But the Mike Blackman is going
[1:58:26] to come to the part where your family
[1:58:28] gets delivered. Oh yes. It's coming.
[1:58:32] It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.
[1:58:36] Let the tape play. Let the dogs bark.
[1:58:39] This caravan is moving on. We are going
[1:58:42] to the rapture. We are going to the
[1:58:43] resurrection. We are going out of here.
[1:58:46] Come up hither. Climb higher. Possess

[1:58:52] bless
