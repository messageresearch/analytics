way for me praise the name of the Lord God bless you amen so we get ready we have just closed a big meeting of Five Nights at the Tabernacle where by God's grace and by his help I have tried hard by the scriptures to set in order the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ as we believe at the brandham Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say is that the pastor is always in full charge of the Tabernacle in my absence and I only look to the pastor when I return so he is in full charge to change or to do whatsoever he thinks its best under the leadership of the Holy Spirit while I am away we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for our peoples of this day we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all of the signs and the Wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returns we believe in those things and believe that they are to be set in order that the church has its order and each church has its doctrines and Order and discipline our church has no members as joiners we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and sisters and all people are always welcome regardless of what denomination they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at eth and Penn Street in Jeffersonville Indiana we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 for Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the the person has been Sanctified the unclean habits is gone from the person he's the believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer it's just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking it up ready for to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to The Sinner he's still filthy then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the alar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is uh not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gift I believe at the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we're born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we're even become adults while we're yet children the gifts that we have of God is in a sand and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts the gifts in operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians 12 now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in ever local church although in such we have found throughout the world that there's much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be uh Apostolic Believers just as they are other orders and so forth we have Fanatics that's been all along we've had those to the ages they had it in the apostolic day and as Paul said there that how that some had come and persuade them away after other doctrines and so forth but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else and what he had taught let be a curse so we as the brandom Tabernacle at ath and Pinn Street year try to follow the teachings of the New Testament for we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was a called and chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order now we believe in water baptism in the brandom Tabernacle by nursing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic uh teaching of the Bible and may all members of the or comers to the brandom Tabernacle who desire such May at any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus May consult the pastor if they have repented and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the Fellowship of the Believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is giving to every man to prophit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring a reproach which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days Paul said when there come a stranger Among Us and we've all speak with tongues won't the man go away and say we were mad but if one would prophesy and make KNN the secret of the heart then they would fall fall down and say truly God is with you am now we believe that the spiritual gifts among the Believers is the order of the dayl we cannot believe that a man can preach under inspiration and then or be an inspired teacher and then Deni the gift of healing or the gift of Prophecy or speaking with tongues or interpretation of tongues or any of these other gifts so therefore here is my belief in God's word the way the brandom Tabernacle at eth and Penn Street year in jonville should be operated I think the first thing and believe that these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the Bram Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord and if at any time these this would be question the person who is in question about it may consult me if they cannot get to the pastor or they could consult the pastor if I'm home off for some of the trips I'll be glad to to help either the leoty or the pastor at any time and these things are scripturally and I believe it's the order of the church I think first that every every member or every worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man all man will know you're my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for the other and we believe that it's the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth to die for us all God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life and the everlasting life here is God's own life because we become Sons and Daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised now the next thing we believe that these worshippers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues and people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever began the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights and at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services began I believe the brandom Tabernacle at all time should have a spirit filled pianist who would come early filled with the Holy Spirit and would play softly very softly Spiritual music such as down at the cross where the Savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name something on that order near my God to thee Rock of Ages cleff or me or near The Cross or something on that order softly slowly as he is meditating constantly on the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it may be then I believe that the worshippers coming in should be met and their hanger coats and hats sh to their seats with h Hospitality that only ushers are deacons filled with the Holy Spirit can do and in love to see the Church of the Living God go on these worshippers should not talk one with another and be talking across and making noise in the church they should come together first slip up in silent prayer amen perhaps at the altar for a few moments no loud praying you interrupt someone else silent prayer you're in worship put that soak in worship Him in your spirit then return to your seat or you do not have to go to the altar just go in and get your seat sit down Listen To The Music close your eyes bow your head and be in silent wor worshiping God all along then if the spirit should reveal something to another or or someone be filled with the spirit to a place where they would speak with tongues then this person should rise and give the message and everyone must hold their peace until the interpretation comes when the interpretation comes it must not be just quoting of scripture or something that has no meaning it must be a message directed to the church or we think that it would be in the flesh we see so much of that and I I believe the the spirit was to speak only for the edifying of the church and now it would be a message something on this order Perhaps Perhaps the people are gathering by this time some sick people has come in perhaps there's a man laying paralyzed or something you've never seen him before but when the interpretation would come would be something in this order when the interpretation of the one who has just spoke would say uh well thus saith the Lord the man who is in our midst has come from a certain certain place and describe the place and would say that he is paralyzed because three or four years ago or whatever it may the case may be he did something evil like left his wife and children and run off from him and he's fell from a trussle or something like that order and got hurt and paralyzing thus saith the Lord if he will repent of that and will promise to go to his wife and reconcile himself to her then he shall be healed now and returned to his family and then before anyone says anything there must be at least two or more man are peoples in the building who are spiritually solid and gospel Doctrine who has a good discernment of spirit shall rise up and say that it is of the Lord and if this thing doesn't take place then tongues should not be mentioned in the church if the person speaks with tongues Paul said there be no interpreter and so forth let them speak at at home or wherever they may be for they're only blessing themselves and it's not for edification of the church then this person after speaking in the interpretation and then two or three judges according to St Paul's doctrine of the Bible that it must be judged by two or three judges then let the person whom it calls upon to go it maybe it might designate a certain person or the pastor or someone to go lay hands on this person and it it's sick or Afflicted and they will be healed then let the pastor or the other person whoever it may be it was designated by the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of faith let them go and minister to the person according to what the spirit has said then at that time the person and whatever the Holy Spirit has said it shall take place immediately then just as the Holy Spirit has given then the people could rejoice and be thankful and praise and worship God because God wants to be worshiped then they must then they must bow their heads and be in prayer again to see if there be another message that the holy spirit will want these gifts to manifest before and then if any time that a person would speak in tongues and interpret and the the judges would send the person to take to do whatever it was said to be done and it doesn't come to pass then the whole group of them shall go to the Altar and they pray God to take that spirit away from them because there's no one would want a spirit like that we would know it would be false and would be of the enemy and not of God because God can only tell truth let that be clearly understood by the church before you start this this new order then perhaps maybe it would be something like this the message would say to a certain brother maybe it say would live by a railroad track or something to have him to move out because there is going to be a wreck on the road or something or anything in that order and let the judges after they give the church permission to speak or to exercise this uh message that just went forth if their judgment is it's of God then watch and see if it comes to pass and if it comes to pass thank God and be very graceful graceful in your heart toring and give him praise and worship and be humble Above All Things be humble don't never get yourself puffed up to a place where you know more about it than your pastor or the church that you're worshiping in if you get to that place then I'd advise each one of you to get another place to worship with because I am asking the pastor never to permit anything outside of the Bible order a way we have seen it here in the church and then we want these gifts to be operated in place and the worshippers if it's carried on correctly according to the word you'll see a mighty wonderful church and operation for our Lord Jesus Christ now then the next thing shall take place will be that if these people who have that gets out of order uh during these times that a deacon or some uh Usher that's filled with the Holy Ghost and got lots of Grace in their heart shall go to the person reverently fatherly like and shall correct them in this manner are the pastor whoever it may be which would be more essential for the deacons to do so for the pastor at this time while these spiritual services are going on should be in the prayer room or somewhere a Praying these messages then if there's no messages going on no Revelations then the people would be privileged if they desired to raise and give a testimony a testimony only for the glory of God they're not bound to do this but testimony should be given before the message or any song service starts or anything testimonies in these worship services do you understand church that in doing this you have the whole church in the spirit of worship before the word comes in to be taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the word and manifests God through the word to be a confirmation of your worship now then after this uh time for the pastor to come on if messages are going on say the pastor should come out exactly say 7:30 and or quarter of eight and if these messages are still going on before the pastor comes to his out of his study or wherever he may to take his place at the platform some brothers should instruct him because the Saints knows that when the pastor comes on the platform it's his time then for the service and that gives plenty ample time for all the manifestations of the gifts to bring the spirit of God into the the congregation and if any unbeliever would happen to be there be disorderly a kindhearted person would go to them such as an usher or a deacon and would tell them if they would they would ask to be kept reverent or be reverent while the service is in order because the spirit is in the building and the gifts of of God are being made manifest for the edifying of the church and this person must be told in love and not harshly unless it would come to a place where they were drinking or some disobedient or something another that would be interfering with the worship of of the Lord uh which the gifts are then are being manifest then the person should would should be led out to one side to one of the back rooms or somewhere and be talked to and dealt with kindly now while the pastor comes to the platform as the pastor comes to the platform I would suggest as the brandom Tabernacle here that the pastor lead the congregation and at least one or two good songs for we have found it so that when too many are trying to operate the in the church it brings on only trouble I would suggest as I did while I was pastoring at the church I led the songs myself and I feel that it would be a good thing if the pastor did so himself and in all prayer meetings where they're gathered together groups of prayer meetings the pastor must be at each one it should never be left to any individual to go lead such meetings for we have found it so that they get off the track on Doctrine and then it call bring it right back into the church and many time bring heresies and so forth which doesn't belong in the Church of the Living God and the pastor should be at all prayer meetings and so forth where congreg Gatherings are and the pastors should never take sides in the meeting the saying that one group is this way and one that way the pastor should stand between both of them and go to them and get them reconciled immediately and if he can't get them reconcile let him take a deacon with him and then if the they W you neither Pastor nor Deacon then it should be told to the church and as Jesus said let them be unto you as a heathen and a Publican and whatever you buy on Earth said Jesus I'll bind in heaven and what you loose on Earth I will loose in heaven now when the pastor comes to the platform let the pastor then lead at least one or two songs and go straight to the word not no time for these long testimony meetings and everybody get up and a word to say that does not prosper in in the brandom Tabernacle if any peop who are listening to this tape and you it has prospered in your church well that's perfectly all right and we're very glad of that that it does prosper in your church but in our church it does not it only causes confusion I've been pastoring here for 20 some odd years and I have found that it only causes confusion if you've got a testimony give it before the in the congregation of the people while spiritual blessing and so forth are the real way to testify is not in the church is out in Dark Places let your light shine where it's dark go to Road houses and different places and where sin and thing is heaping then let your light shine there is the place to do it but however if the Lord has blessed you and give you some great special blessing or something that you have to tell the people do it in time of the other service the pre-service the preliminary or when the spirit is blessing and giving testimonies and Revelations and tongues and interpretations and so forth in the worship of the Saints before the word of God is being brought forth then the pastor after leading this him shall immediately lead the church in prayer and a congregational prayer himself as he stands at the platform asking the rest of them to Bow their heads in prayer this we have found to be a greater blessing and a more ruy and operating in the church and then the next thing the pastor should do then after if they had a real spiritual meeting with the gifts making manifest many secrets of the people's hearts and things which should be done by the gifts in the meeting then the spirit of God is in the meeting and it's very easy then for the pastor to find the spirit of God which is already in the meeting on the word of God as he reads and starts preaching the pastor then preach anything that the Holy Spirit would put on his heart whatever he wishes to do standing there but the congregation is the only they can rejoice as he is preaching of course or say Amen when the word comes forth but as far as getting up and giving uh uh messages and tongues and and interpretation while the Holy Spirit is working through the pastor the scripture condemns that and said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet the pastor then must call this individual down and ask them to be reverent and to keep their place the pastor must be a man that has got a very humble way about him but not too humble for what he could be like the Lord Jesus Christ when he seen wrong going on in the church he platted ropes and ran them out of the church and now the Church of God is the house of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the Elder and the Elder gives it to the people the Saints in their gifts shall have their place first the worship and come together which brings as I have said before the spirit of the Lord in the building for the pastor and it makes it much easier for the Holy Spirit to work through him then when a good spiritual meeting has just proceeded his teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets into the word and teaches the word has just been manifested by the gifts and then the older call is being made then afterward and many then will see and know according to the working of the Holy Spirit and the word of God which a pastor places it on that you are the the Church of the Living God and if Paul said of all he'll fall down and say truly God is with you now in these things let it be done with reverence and now to the pastor to our brother Neville at this time remember he is the full head of the church brother nebble has a right to exercise any Authority that the Holy Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit would tell him to say in other words in the church he has a right to anything that God would lead him to do he also has a right over his Deacon board he can change the Deacon board the trustees or or pianist or any other office in the church that he desires to the change feeling led by the Holy Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does I'll recognize it as he I believe to be a godly man I'll recognize it to be of the Lord and will sanction the saint therefore it gives him the authority then to operate the church the way he feels led to do it now are any office in the church if he desires to to to uh switch uh positions with people well he has the authority to do that which I trust that this will always be lovely and never have to be you now may the Lord bless you all and I trust that this will be uh carried out to the very best of your knowledge and may the Holy Spirit watch over each one of you and may every officer of the church fill his post of Duty knowing this that God is going to hold you responsible for how you help your office in the church each one will have to give an account and to the leoty and the dear gifted Saints that's in our church those who who prophesy or speak with tongues or interpret or have Revelations we are just so happy to have you in the church and we will give you full cooperation in everything that the Holy Spirit shall prove that he has said to you and we love you and we believe that these gifts are in you and that if you have the right opportunity and the scripturally presentation of it that you will make great workers in our midst and may the Lord bless you all is my sincere prayer Christians since listening to this tape I have a one thing that I seen I left out and that is this that while people are speaking with tongues that must be in the courses of two or three according to the scriptures that is there's only two or three messages to be given in each single service after that according to the scriptures that these course this must be only two or three so may you carry these things out accordingly a way the Holy Spirit has directed it in his Bible and this is the the best in my knowledge the way to do it Paul said let them be by courses two or three when they're speaking the Lord bless you praise God let's hold stand I appreciate the message this evening church order thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen let's just sing that song Because He Lives amen let's just raise our hands is [Music] God because I know oh he holds the [Music] future and life is worth living just because he lives one more time hallelujah oh I can face [Music] tomorrow

it and Inspire it our hearts in Jesus name amen verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world let's just bow our heads and close our eyes praise God Heavenly Father Lord your people are gathered here this evening Lord to take part lord of the communion service father where we partake of the Bread and Wine father Lord we pray that you would
