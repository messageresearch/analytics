came and see s we would see Jesus they didn't Point them to themselves they didn't Point them to a man they Point them to Jesus and Jesus pointed them to the Cross where they have to die out to themselves that they could truly see the Lord may we see you tonight in all of the glory granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you and welcome thanks for coming you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to uh three portion of scripture tonight one from second Peter 1 4-7 1 John 22-13 and 1 Corinthians chapter 13 one verse there verse 11 reading from 2 Peter 1 verse4 whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance the temperance patience the patience godliness the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity 1 John 2 want to read verse 12 and 13 I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i r write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 11 it reads whether I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child uh when I became a man I put away childish things let us pray one more time father God we thank you for your presence and your word and and Lord it takes you to make this word come alive and come real to your people father we're not here for games we're not here for performances we're not here for entertainment we are here to hear truth Lord because you said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free we're not here for old talk we're not here to kill time we here to hear from Heaven father may you drop down and speak to your people tonight we wait upon you we are needy have your way I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you amen you may be seated praise God have a context scripture like to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and this is Paul speaking from 4 to 7 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power what was the purpose of that verse 5 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the found the world unto our Glory oh praise God now this verse here verse 6 in the Amplified says here yet when we are among the full grown there's an echo here brother Francis yet when we are among the full grown or spiritually mature Christians who are right in understanding we do impart a higher wisdom the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age nor of this world nor of the leaders and the rulers of this age who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away so this scripture here when we talk about how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect that perfect is to them that are mature amen amen fully grown amen spiritually mature and the title I have tonight is the question of growth Christian maturity and another subject why miss the Mark I you know what you know what sin is right to miss the mark to miss the target to miss the objective of what God want you to strike and hit that's what sin really is okay now Paul writing to different churches each Church representing different levels amen the foolish Galatians he called them the Hebrew babies the carnal Corinthians all these different groups or churches represent let's say different stages or growth or experience expences so the caral church at that time was the Corinthians church the church lacking growth the babies and so on was the Hebrews church the legalistic church galatian church but the ideal church was the Ephesians church amen Paul had no issues with those Believers at Ephesus now the Pinnacle of God's ideal church is Ephesians or Ephesus and that is where we are going back to another Ephesians Alpha and Omega the original have to come back again in other words the corn of seed that went down into the ground it went through processes and come back up bring back the corner seed in this last day again because God works just as nature works hallu you have a seed you plant it it go through processes and it comes back to the original amen so the church Ages was the expression of the unfolding of the mystery of what was lock up in the seed and so is your life Hallelujah your life itself goes two processes amen for you to come to maturity the objective is to come to maturity Hallelujah so he said I write you children that's a stage I write to you young men that's another stage I write them to you fathers that's another stage the object is to get it to fatherhood because you know him from the beginning the object is not for you to come to church a lot of people get old in church they're not mature they haven't grown he objected for you to grow in God because asking to be closer to God that's our desire I want to be closer to you you want to be closer to you he give you Faith Oh Glory to God to St you to get closer then after Faith he give you virtue Oh Glory to God you're getting closer to him then he give you knowledge you want oh you're getting nearer to him now then you get Temperance you get patience Peter talk about these things by these divine nature we become partaker of his divine nature in order to come closer to God and a brotherly you're ready there to T the Holy Spirit right on top of there and then charity come now the bond of perfectness to cover you with that robe to seal all those virtues inside of you that there be no leaks in the building when I was a child I spake like a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things I pushed them aside because I'm coming into Christian maturity could we give the Lord some Praises tonight this is beyond your back with sin come on now we not talking about battle with sin no you're going past that this is you coming to grow in God to come into where God want you to be positionally place as a son and daughter of God in the last days knowing you have inheritance knowing where you come from knowing where you're going and knowing in whom you have believed oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so after the the foundation of the Old Testament God saw it fit to start the church in the in the beginning this original Pentecostal Church light them up on the day of Pentecost and then the out the light went out through the Dark Ages and God bring up Luther Wesley and you know the story and here we are now so God choose these Seven Ages to take us home I see some things here that just blowing my mind here we not at the beginning we at the end of God choose Seven Ages to take us back to Eden because that is where we going back to we're going back to the original because that is where God put man in the beginning to have dominion and power but man fell but he said I will restore so no devil hell could stop the restoration of God when God say he going to bring you back he going to bring you back when God say he can deliver you he'll deliver you one thing God cannot do is lie God can't lie oh give the Lord some Praises God say he going to heal you he going to heal you God going to set the family free he going to set your family free because God can't lie we have confidence in him we trust him when we don't understand we trust him when we don't know what's going on oh give the Lord a shout in the house that is when we sure our trust in him oh glory to [Applause] God so when we talk about perfection we talking talking about maturity a mature son a mature daughter this is what God desires sons that can receive his intelligence to know what the father once done with his word in other words the anointing Supreme anointing to know what and how that's what Jesus had he knew exactly what he had to do he even told uh Joseph and Mary I must must be about my father's business and during his ministry he could said my hour is not yet come you can't touch me you can't touch me because my hour is not yet come and when the time come he said my hour has come oh give the Lord some Praises in other words he was in contact with intelligence which is the mind which is of god and in your situation right now what you're in there's a mind of God for it you may not know it but there's a mind of God you're not lost is not impossible when Moses was brought to the Red Sea mountains on both sides and Pharaoh coming down breathing on his back there was a mind of God behind it Moses sought to cry out and say God what's going on Moses sought to do that God said why cry speak and move forward God saw a way where there was no way God saw a way through the Red Sea and sometime you're looking up you're looking down you're looking around and God going and bust a hole and make away oh give the Lord a shout you're getting me exciting tonight Hallelujah you making me Be Inspired tonight oh hallelujah what was God telling Moses get out the humanistic realm stay in the spirit don't let them complainers and backsliders throw you off the anointing stand still and see the salvation of the Lord your God give me some maturity give me some mature Sons speaking Sons anointed Sons [Applause] Hallelujah but your sons that can receive this his intelligence to know what the father want done with the word real Christianity mature Christians not just from a knowledge of the word but from the intimacy of knowing him the person hallah huj what we have now is an intellectual Bunch people that have a lot of knowledge just knowledge shall increase you have people who know quite a lot but they don't know him and not the knowledge is life to know him is life the person Hallelujah are you with me now glory to God so Hebrews 5 says for when for okay uh Paul there's an example Hebrews 52 12 for when for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one tissue again which be the first principle of the Oracles of God and have become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that is use that milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe so baby is a stage child is a stage young man is a stage isn't that right and fathers is a stage Hallelujah hallu so he said but strong meat belongeth to them that are fool ag even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern yes both good and evil so what does that tell you about somebody who can't discern good and evil they're not mature they need to grow something is lacking so this is beyond the battle with sin and that's truck Sunday when I just said some myself but never said that before this is not talking about overcoming sin and sin and sin no this is grow now and to grow you have to get birth to grow bir then grow isn't that right now the word to miss the mark in the Greek Lexicon is a word called hamaa h a m a r t i e it means to miss the mark am to to be mistaken right to miss or wonder from the part of of uprightness and honor to wonder from the law of God to violate God's law and sin a violation of Divine Law in thought or in act the miss the mark describe falling short of God's standards or commands I just love this tonight because this have nothing to do with church church folks like to go to church they just go to church like a ritual for years we not talking about that we talking about the Living God hallelujah I try to show you over and over the promise that God gave Abraham to deliver his people and they come out and 400 years and so on it be a Strange Land and so on that is a promise God gave to Abraham okay The People Under Pressure the under Pharaoh but they don't know God God spoke to Abraham Abraham knew God Isaac knew God that's why he said the god of our fathers the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob these men met God spoke to God you understand I'm saying then them million people there know nothing who this God Is So when God commissioned Moses he said bring them to this mountain so I could reveal myself to them by my law by my word that's right that they will know who I am How I Live what I stand for he tell Moses put some barricas around the mountain if an animal cross it kill it don't let nothing come cross that line when Moses hit the ground he said take off your shoes because this is not your ground this is not your land you on right now any land I touch is Holy Ground show me is God your servant it's God you're worshiping in other words I'm From Another Dimension I'm not from your plane Oh Glory I come down to the deliver I'm sending you and the people were partying and carrying on why Moses was getting the Ten Commandments written by the Finger of God hallelujah oh give the Lord I shout hallelujah hallelujah Moses come down with the Ten Commandments and see the people on we know the story who's on the Lord's Side come to me who don't want it they stay and party and then the Earth open up and swallow them the people saw all of that these people saw the plagues that hit Egypt they saw the plagues that hit pharaoh and they still be bad because the Bible said the heart is desperately wicked and who can know it but God oh glory to God you could wear the best suit the best side the best dress but who could know that heart but God so he said I'm going to give you a offer a new heart I will give you oh glory to God a heart towards my word a new spirit I will give you that you can live and agree with your neighbor and then I will give you my spirit that formula a change when you shake it up so is the same formula a new heart a new spirit and my spirit oh give the Lord I shout in the house God has changing for nobody God is not a Trinidadian God is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word is here tonight and the word become flesh and dwell among us and that word want to come in your flesh oh give the Lord some Praises don't sit down and do like I'm not talking about you I am talking about you this word can't stay in the Bible this word had to become flesh in you oh give the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah glory to God hall hallelujah hallelujah hallelu to miss the mark falling short of God's standards or commands as in the scriptures to miss the markah this implies not just making mistakes but failing to live up to the moral and ethical standards set by God James 4:17 says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin amen so he's not talking about you going and do sin he's talking about so that sin can also be a failure to do what is right think on that tonight sa take a pause on that we not talking about going do wickedness and El but failure to do what is right and that's why when people don't do all that they're supposed to do which is the mechanics getting your heart right doing what is right you can't have full confidence you can't present Amen to God your full faith am because you are shorten him if you're not praying you're not studying you're not reading you're not in the word you're not in the spirit you're coming you're loing then you're loing and other people praying you will tell others to pray for you and you're not even praying for yourself you're lazy Hallelujah but nobody want to tell you that I tell you [Music] thatl that is not maturity that you are slacker my father long time when somebody AC slack you see slack on chiny pants whatever the expression it is I just say slacker on a Chinese pants you real slack 1 John 34:9 says what whosoever committed sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know he was manifested to take away our sins and and in him is no sin look how this word is being presented okay sin you're breaking the law but he was manifested to take it away from us that we in other words he dealt with the same question we we shouldn't have to deal with that again oh Glory my God we should close off right here right now you could shout on that one tonight Jesus when he paid the price on Calvary he de with the same question once this man hey offered his blood once and w perfected forever them that are Sanctified oh God help me tonight oh glory to God I'm in Heavenly places tonight he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified in other words he answered the question of sin at Calvary now we have a question of growth oh give the Lord a shout that's a question Oh Glory to God if you're going to stay in this way forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I did wrong and forgive and you're inside of there or you want to grow in God hallelujah am like how God tell Abraham walk before me and be th perfect and he know he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth had not seen him neither know him little children let no man deceive you he that doth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he commits sins of the devil for the devil sinned from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that's right whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for his seed remain in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God now here this in the Amplified everyone who commits practices sin is guilty of lawlessness not just commits but practices that is what sin is lawlessness the breaking violating of God's law by trans transgression or neglect being unrestrained unregulated by his commands and his will in other words you do your own thing and still come to church right because you have no accountability and nobody's looking over your shoulder and that's why people like legalism Pastor that's why they like generals and militant generals because they don't have internal internal discipline and they want somebody to discipline them to bring a whip and they beat them and they straighten up left turn right turn and whatnot and they expose this they expose that and they feel good about that because somebody and the external amen is doing it Hallelujah but that is what the law was Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal that was external and it still couldn't work oh glory to God so he said I'm going to put my laws inside your heart oh give the Lord a sh because the law on the outside couldn't work th sh not cover the neighbor wife Thou shalt not cover the neighbor's Goods oh give the Lord a shout the law couldn't work Hallelujah so then God bring Grace in the person of Jesus Christ to give an opportunity to get that law that was the outside and the inside that you can get the internal restraint or [Applause] discipline hallelujah what I want to show you the external couldn't bring them to matur even Jesus told them I have to go if I don't go the comforter will not come I am with you but shall be in you he knew the power they needed to withstand the devil the power they needed to overcome had to come on the inside the anointing they had to share in his ministry was temporary power but he was promising and permanent power oh give the Lord I shout out of your bellies shall flow rivers of Living Water oh give the Lord a shout in the house he that believeth on me as the scripture had [Applause] saides God above us God With Us God in us amen God coming down Hallelujah Hallelujah unrestrained unregulated by his commands and his will you know that he appeared in visible form and became man to take away upon himself sins and in him there's no sin for six this is the part I want to get to no one who abides in him who lives and remains in communion with and obedience to him deliberately knowingly habitually commits or practices sin no one who habitually sins had either seen or known him and he went down deeper recognize perceive or understood him or had an experiential acquaintance with him that's how deep it is I love this tonight I hope that this is edifying to you boys lad let no one deceive you and Lead You astr he who practices righteousness who is upright conforming to the Divine will and purpose thought and action living a consistently conscientious life is righteous even as he is righteous Hallelujah no one begotten of God deliberately knowingly habitually practices sin for God's nature abides in him his principle of Life the Divine sperm remains permanently within him and he cannot practice sinning because he is born or begotten of God and the Bible says that was not born of the will of man nor of the will of flesh but of B but of God so your birth have to be Supernatural your birth can't be coming to church and say what you believe I don't care what you believe something supernatural has to happen on the inside oh give the Lord a shout born of God just as you was born of a woman you have to be born of God born of the word and born of the spirit oh the flesh profited nothing oh give the Lord some Praises tonight oh do you love him tonight you have to love him in to serve him oh glory to God hallelujah motivated by love Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah let's go Hebrews 3 ver 7 I can't say sorry I'm reading all these things tonight this is where I get to preach it tonight Hall and I felt like this was for like a Sunday I tell myself Lord you have more meal you have more food for Sunday and know I bringing this tonight normally this this sort of thing here I will leave for Sunday but I a say say Lord he have a he have a a c a thousand hills he have more land he have more food he have more on menu he have more things to feed and eat let me give them this one time this is let let them Eagles put the the beak inside this meat and rip it out tonight oh glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah Hebrews 3:7 says wherefore as the Holy Ghost sayth today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in a provocation in the day day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me so God speaking when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they always do H in their heart for and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath in his anger they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren least there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God and this heart blow my mind and exalt one another daily I don't know I Des script the only time I exalt one another daily while it is called today least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin let's hear the Amplified on that therefore the holy spirit says today if you would hear his voice do not Harden your hearts as happened in the rebellion of Israel and their provocation and embitterment of me in the day of testing in the wilderness where your fathers tried my patience and tested my forbearance and found I stood their test and they saw my works for 40 years and so I was provoked displeased and sorely grieved with that generation and said they always H and the let strain their hearts and they have not perceived or recognized my ways and become progressively better and more experient exp mentally and intimately acquainted with them accordingly I swore in my Roth and my indignation they shall not enter my rest hear this one therefore beware Brethren amen take care amen lest be any of one of you a wicked unbelieving heart which refuses to cleave to trust in and rely on him leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the Living God but instead here we go one admonish urge and encourage one another every day it didn't say breakdown it didn't say gosip it didn't say back talk it didn't say whisper in somebody's ears negativity about brother or sister it didn't say that it say urge to encourage one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened into settled rebellion and I have seen that people get hardened in their Rebellion they get hardened and you rebuke not even affecting them no more because they Harden in their possession watch least you be hardened into subtle Rebellion by the deceitfulness of sin by the fraudulence the stratagem the trickery which the delusive glamour of this sin may play on him to miss the mark hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah William brand the key of vision the word of the Lord there is nothing can change or stop it so when God presents a vision a word Vision doesn't matter who say what who criticize that's why I don't bother with any voices outside yes Hallelujah I know whether with the critics who say we this and that and what not let them talk dog the car move on why big glass somebody say put ony air conditioner keep driving am let the dogs just back amen amen but you're moving

supposed to take pictures because of who they are they train for that something like that amen well we don't know who we are God come down to bring the word to bring a revelation that we could begin to walk into who we are he don't expect it to walk backwards in sin backwards where it come from you leave the world to come into church you leave the world to come into the word you leave the world leave the world there don't put a hook and like you towing something you're a tow truck Hallelujah you're towing your past you're throwing your memories you're towing your failures I remember brother long time every time I meet him he start to talk about these sins and this happened and that happened and I used to feel sorry for them because some Pastor because of manipulation keep reminding them

all that's all preach the word and see who are Fai to take it because when the word was preached in Moses time they didn't mix the word with Fai that's why they backslide that's why they couldn't make it true because the word they heard all of them he the word but it wasn't mixed with faith and what God sent a prophet to do to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers that when the real word come it could mix with the faith inside your soul oh give the Lord a shout and make bread on the table hallelujah hallelujah shoe bread on the table hallah amen and amen hallelujah if you miss that miss being a son and daughter of God you miss the mark to miss the word sin means to miss the mark miss the Mark I'm shooting a Target I drive an attack at 50 yards I shoot and take my gun down and shoot I miss it four five Ines what happened my gun needs tuning up there's something wrong if I miss faith in God if I miss being a Christian God put you here to be a Christian and I can tell you tonight straight you are not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire and when God put the desire for you to be a Christian then it's you falling short because he desire for you to break through all the Angels trying to encourage you and prop you up to make you through make it but you got to make the decision you got to open the door you got to make a way you got to surrender you got to yield it's your choice question of growth that's your choice wow hall hallelujah God put you here to be a Christian if you're off to one side come back and get C up when you meet them back side is tell them come and get tune up the engine knocking tap it Knocking they need a oil change they need some Spock plugs hallelujah or they need to change the battery cannot move in our fathers had the TAC wildness and God desire to have a tabernacle Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in Temple made with hands as sayth the prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stool what house will you build me say the Lord or what is the place of my rest but a body has thou prepared me what is a tabernacle now a body God tabernacling in a body God once up high and when he come down on the mountain even a bulock or cow touch the mountain he had to be killed because God is Holy now a holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain where God was then God was made flesh and dwell Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son give his life here we go and the blood cell of God was broken and the life might come out of the blood to us through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life into the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us change changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit the ministers can't change that brother punch they could flip the script and flip Mysteries and flip histories and all kind of stuff they can't change that your nature is changed by Holy Spirit not by Mysteries and histories Give the Lord a shout disy place a shout youel this is the place to make [Applause] noise by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God and Jesus said at that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me I in you amen the question of grouped mature Christians Matthew 13 Jesus speaks about the parable of the seed and this part I get want to take up here he that receives seed among Thorns they not Wayside or rocks we talking about the T people now that the people we have in the message just weite done out them pass through G Rockies has comeing and jump a while Hallelujah glory and they disappear we're not talking about that this last two is what we're looking at here he that receive seed among the torns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it become unfruitful he that received seed and a good ground is he that Hearth the word and understanded it which also bear fruit bringing forth some 100 fold some 60 some 30 no bokor you know born is right when you peel everything out even my grain waste of time the Amplified of that says and for what Pur among torns this is he who bear hears the word but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and Glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the word yields no fruit so you're talking about environment now hearing the word in church hearing the message hear seals Thunders new name Revelations Mysteries but choked yes Hallelujah and as for what was shown on good soil this is he who hears the word grasp comprehends it he indeed hears bear fruit yield in one case 100 times as much as was sown in another 60 times as much in another 30 so you realize God is Progressive God not subtraction and division he's the multiplication blessing add act to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and Temperance so you cannot tell God you give me this and look look it back here that man who bu the talent I bury it here the same thing I give me 20 years ago I have the same thing nothing nothing nothing move no growth yes yes Hallelujah no interest no addition don't be caught there I can't see people going in Rapture not growing you know I can't I can't really can see that you know you're staying right here with the tribulation the rest of the tribulation SCS Enoch walked with God yes and was not for God took him Enoch walked and he was climbing the pyramid and

one that is taken other than that tribulation Sint do you comfort one another St John 15 so much of scriptures tonight yeah this's the word man I am the True Vine J Jesus speaking and my father is the husband man I am not husband man he's my father is husband man every branch in me in the message in Trinidad cool getting frighten am every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away and every branch that bear fruit he Purge it clips clips you call it a pruning knife a pruning instrument every branch in meet a buried fruit he purchased it to bring forth more fruit so he have fruit but he want more fruit now you are clean Through The Words which I've spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abide in me and I in him the same bringing forth much fruit so there's fruit more fruit and much fruit what are you seeing tonight growth increase and what's the last scripture here is if he abide in me okay and if a man abide not in me is cast for as a branch is wiard and Men gather them and cast Into the Fire and they burn if you abide in me and my words are abide in you you shall ask what you will it shall be done unto you and hear the bum heing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so fruit is not good enough more fruit is not good enough my father is glorified by shout it out much fruit shout it out much fruit shout it out one more time much fruit Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God Amen Let's see we get home stretch here hallelujah all right the sunlight is sent to the Earth in the natural to ripen the grain for the advancing Harvest each Day brings forth a new sun the sun that is shining today bringing the wheat up in Canada that same Sun it didn't have no more Sun than that this coming July or August it could never ripen the green it's got to be stronger and more powerful each day as it grows and matures to bring the green on so the son have a job the sun job is to bring that grain to maturity so that's why the prophet talk about the hot July sun because when the grain is green and the shock hole in it is green you don't know who is who but when the sun start to hit it so the Shar start to dry up and the grain becomes golden brown by the same Sun Hallelujah so that sun dries up one and ripens another oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God so the seed in you will come to maturity by this son this s so n this Holy Spirit Dynamics to the mechanics this Pillar of Fire Oh Glory to God will dry up the church member and go to ripen the elect to give the Lord some Praises oh how many feel good with this world tonight oh you have been elected and predestinated you call for this hour woo hallelujah hallelujah hallu if the grain itself it begins to mature the grain comes on it stays right what each day the husk around it the part of calcium whatever it goes in it builds right into the green as the sun gets stronger but you take the Sun that shines in August and put it on the wheat to day it will kill it so the July Sun August Sun can't work on the February wheat it will kill it it's too much of heat God had to make sure things dry around you that you're ready for that son now some people can't handle the son they want to cuss they want to leave they want to give up and everything else because the heat upon them but the elect the child of your faith is more precious than gold that perisheth God put heat for your faith faith that can't be tested can't be trusted so God has test your faith that it can be trusted oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah oh glory to God I believe in all my my heart God will get some ripen seeds some mature seeds and the question of growth will be answered you're growing in God hallelujah hallelujah the grain is matured with the light if it goes ahead with the light hallu the bread that we need is the Bible it is the complete revelation of God's plan it is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ we add nothing to it take anything from it whosoever does his name will be taken not of the book of life we don't need any Creeds to add to this it's written just the way it's supposed to be we don't add nothing to it take nothing from it preach just the way it is and God will manifest it I believe that with all my heart God will vindicate his word this is not my word this is God word that tumor have to dissolve that cancer have to go that blind I have to pop open the deaf have to hear the dumb have to speak the have to walk dead have to be raised up oh glory to God Hallelujah when the thoughts of God drop down and it hit the mouth then it's God's word and my word shall not return me void oh give the Lord some Praises you talk about sons of God coming forth brother said oh God help me lift to see it woo he didn't live to see it he saw it by Vision but you want to see it you want to live to see it the manifestation of the sons of God when born Sons mature Sons fill Sons seal Sons speak and their word is created just like that back to Eden because the book is on the earth the same book Adam lost has been restored we will vindicate and prove that book is on the earth oh glory to God sun come out and Shine for days Vindicated the book on the earth little fish I give you back your life vindicate the book on the earth before the doctor un touches my wife the tumor will go down that vindicate the book on the earth wait till them seven Thunders H their voices of that group they're going to slice and

glory to God Luther Wesley and the Pentecostal musicians get ready to come hallelujah hallelujah hallu the Pentecostals restoration of the gifts but now we have promised the restoration of the original grain Hallelujah the same grain that W down in the ground that's why I keep saying I don't want no less pay than what Peter had same pay same life same sensation same action what they have we have to have nothing less than that I ain't taking no message talk I ain't taking no book talk I want what Peter have Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have give it unto thee that is what he had we going to have the same [Applause] [Music] thing the Angels came down to Abraham after 25 years not to change him yet but to bring a comfort I will return to thee according to Time Of Life S I laugh and the prophet says that he told the doctor doctor I want to ask you a com you tell me I eat food every day and it turns to blood blood cells his life I renew my life every day she that's right but why is I eat the same food when I was 18 and that much food when I was 18 I become stronger and bigger I'm eating the same food I'm getting weak all the time because what God Said death is upon us it's not the food so his wife said you know Bill you you know you're getting almost completely baldheaded I said I knew it but glory to God there's not one here perish I said she said what I said not one of them perish she said where are they where was they before they come on my head Hallelujah they in the same place God knows where they at and he will give them back to me again in the resurrection now I have to give it this because this is food for your soul God when he brings a little baby in this earth he let it grow to maturity he is painting a picture in his great infinite mind he sees that young man man or young woman is just at its best when they are standing there at their best and that's the way I want them in the resurrection Hallelujah you have a baby yes young child teenager and then at the peak whether 18 19 at the very best that is how we will be God give a sample run of how we will be at your best no gray hair no stoop shoulder no lost teeth no false teeth no amen bald head you will be at your best this should make you leave here with your hands up in the air [Applause] tonight watch this mother you have a great time 20 23 years old about time you get 25 you're not the boy you used to be you say mother you didn't you notice some wrinkles are coming under your eyes what's the matter death set in that's right God ordain it so but the only thing that death can do is to pull you in this corner and that corner after a while it's going to take you but that's all it can do in the resurrection death is destroyed death have no power in the resurrection Hallelujah and what you was at your best that is what you will be I'll come I'll give you a word tonight what you was as your best is what you will be in the resurrection oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah there's a mystery unfolding here tonight god brother kangali was going to do the Abraham and all his seed by what he did to Abraham and Sarah that's right did you catch that so Abraham being changed back to a young man Sarah being changed back to a young woman is an example of what God will do to the seeds of Abraham there's going to be a Rapture there is going to be a resurrection God can't lie oh give the Lord a shout tonight Hallelujah hallo Hallelujah ABR was 100 Sarah was 90 and God said I'm going to show the world in other words what I'm going to do to you and to your seed after you he turned Abraham and Sarah from an old man and woman back to a young man and woman my God we have courage tonight we have faith tonight I the songwriter said death have no power over the Blood Washed ones Oh Glory to God hallelujah he made a brand new man he made a brand new woman Oh Glory to God hallelujah Halle Hallelujah he said I could see Abraham say honey do you know your shoulders are straightened up your hair is becoming black again and she said Abraham my Lord I notice your shoulders are straightened up your hair is becoming a young man again oh glory to God hallelujah I'm going to close with this Hallelujah but I'm talking about Elijah Hallelujah Juniper Tre struggling angel food and then he needed a rest how we need in this journey and we are now to find a place of rest and to Feast on the word of God so that it will give us strength night after night go to the room and rest come back next morning fresh eat more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church I believe that we have been children long enough God is going to turn his church into manhood now we have played and Frolic as children but now we are going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity I believe it was Paul who said when I was a child I spake as a child because he thought as a child but it's time that we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business so the church here we go is not in its right state yet we have to remember that it is not matured so we just have to linger and do the best we can and there is no one here we go there is no one can bring it to maturity only the Holy Spirit as we listen to it I don't believe it will ever come by man it will come by God oh glory to God so Jesus he was the first son all right two minutes Hallelujah that come to full maturity to be in God and because he was the first God pick him up yes and wave him Hallelujah as a wave sheath as a testimony that other Sons will come and be matured oh give the Lord some Praises so Jesus was the first son with mechanics and Dynamics come into maturity and God wave him as the wave shave and he said you are promise according to Luke 17:30 that the word is to wave over the people that the de tradition of men is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and giving us life give we stand and give God some Praises begin to play something father God we thank you tonight for your word and your spirit we thank you for the word Lord and I pray your
