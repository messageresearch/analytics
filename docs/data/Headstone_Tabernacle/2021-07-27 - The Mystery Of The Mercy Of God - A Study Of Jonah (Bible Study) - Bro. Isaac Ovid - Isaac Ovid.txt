yesterday today and forever lord so may you walk out the pages of the bible tonight and may you speak to our hearts in a lord new and living way father a refreshing of your presence upon us all lord we thank you for each one that's here tonight and lord the sacrifice and the effort lord to be here we commit this study into your hands lord may you inspire each one may you give us the focus and lord the right attitude lord your word teaches us that the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass so lord as we get into one mind and one accord and forget the distractions forget the hustle and the bustle and the news and the pandemic and all these things that so could easily be set us father we want to focus on what you want to see to us tonight lord take be completely out of the way and may you speak lip to hear to your children may you encourage us from your word that we commit this meeting into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be back in bible study and to be behind this sacred desk albeit virtually recognizing that uh during this whole time that we're living in god has food for us and encouragement for us and um i have not had the opportunity to speak in in some time and it's good to be uh here in fellowship with everyone tonight those that i can see i appreciate that those that i cannot see i appreciate you as well and i pray that god will bless you in your homes in your families in your walk on this battlefield this great battle that beloved was speaking about and permitting last friday night this this good fight this good fight it's a good fight and um and i want to encourage you all to keep fighting the good fight of fate and that we are born to fight i'm not going to be too long with you tonight we are now starting back school and you know there i remember when school used to start back that first day of school you know things used to be kind of a kind of easy class now you know so tonight we have an easy class to start the term off as we coming post convention and i'd like to take this time to really thank god for the wonderful convention and for the efforts and the sacrifice um both near and far for all who certainly were part of this great work of god in such a time as this when there's darkness and a creeping darkness everywhere but in the midst of that we are challenged and encouraged to arise and shine for our lights has come so i want to encourage that as well and certainly it will be remiss of me there are so many greetings and salutations that are deserving um so many birthdays and anniversaries and different celebrations but it would be remiss of me to not acknowledge that yesterday was the birthday of the first lady of headstone tabernacle sister anne-marie ovid who is the wife of our pastor um but if i'm saying when god call a man he call his wife and i could i could i could speak from a position of authority when i say that beloved will not be the man he is today if it wasn't for the sister of it so i certainly want to thank god for her and for her birthday and for another year of her life and i am also a direct beneficiary of her ministry you know so we really love and appreciate it and we wish her so many more years of labor as god has really blessed her to be able to raise a god-fearing family in this dark and terrible day that we're living in to know that it takes more than just words but it has to be a life that inspires us into action so we really appreciate that and we love and appreciate everyone here tonight and those that may not have been able to connect but will hear the tape that despite whatever challenge or trial or situation that you are faced with you are born for a greater purpose and if you see everything else as a distraction and you keep single-eyed and focused on what god has planned for us then good things are in store for us so tonight without any further hesitation i have a thought tonight the mystery of the mercy of god the mystery of the mercy of god a bible study i i don't want to identify the character we will study just yet um because i want to start and i'm going to read a scripture to kind of give the background to where this is going to go tonight but the mystery of the mercy of god a study of and we're gonna get to the character in a second but i want to start and we're gonna move to a few scriptures before we get to our substantive text tonight but i want to start in matthew uh 12 um if you have your bibles you should have it because it's a bible study and matthew 12 and we're going to read from verse 38 tonight just to kind of lay a background to what we will study tonight and to kind of see what god wants us to learn from this um we know bible study for us is a very practical very hands-on it's a practical class it's not just theory and we are looking to see what changes god wants in our behavior in our hearts and our lives our last study was job we did a part one and a part two and we were able to you know kind of see what god wanted to achieve through job and tonight we want to see what god will achieve but i want to kind of build a background before i get into who we will study tonight so matthew 12 and verse 38 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seek it after a sign and there shall be no sign there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas now i want to read it in the amplified now these are not regular people speaking to jesus these are scribes and pharisees so these are learned the scribes were those who would be diligent at taking notes and records and history in the historical context and they would have a very clear expectation and an understanding of what should be taking place and of course the pharisees were on order unto themselves but in the amplified it says then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we want to see a sign and the amplified said a testing miracle so by a sign they wanted to see a display of something that they could see they were they were not satisfied with just the words that they were hearing they want to see a sign from you proving that you are what you claim to be so it was not just a sign that they wanted it was a sign as a challenge you know to say if you saw this saying then we will believe you so it was a sign of a childhood and it really disturbed jesus and he responded a certain way but he replied and said to them an evil and adulterous generation that is morally unfaithful to god craves and demands a miraculous sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah verse 40 for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold are greater than jonas is here the queen of the salt shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold are greater than solomon is here in jesus's earthly ministry he will reference only four writing prophets he would reference isaiah he would reference daniel he will reference zechariah and he would reference jonah jonah is unique because he receives more than just a mention the passage we read allows us to see that jesus identified himself with this prophet's three-day journey in the belly of the great whale noting it as a foreshadow of his own death that jesus would spend three days in the heart of the earth before his resurrection it is interesting to note that jesus was also identifying himself with the lowest or one of the lowest points of jonah's own life and ministry he was identifying himself not with a high point in jonah's life or moment of celebration for jonah but a moment of all the almost crushing defeat a moment of highlighting a man who was not where he was supposed to be we could argue the lowest point of his life teaches us something about god and the way he operates by now we should kind of know where i'm going so i'll complete my title the mystery of the mercy of god a study of jonah the book of jonah stands as an important link in the call of the prophetic chain giving us a glimpse into the death and resurrection of christ and a type that existed hundreds of years before jesus was actually on the earth our substantive text will be in jonah but before we get there the introduction to jonah is not found in jonah the introduction to jonah is found in the book of second kings so we can go to second kings 14. second kings 14 to verse 23 lay another foundation to what we want to speak about jonah here tonight second kings 14 verse 23 and it says in second kings 14 23 in the 15th year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria and reigned forty and one years and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebuch who made israel to sin we would have read this when we were studying kings many bible studies ago he restored the coast of israel from the entering of muhammad unto the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel listen which he speak by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amitai the prophet which was of gather so we see jonah's ministry is not just captured in the book of jonah but his ministry also had a duration his ministry had a timing there were words that were spoken from jonah that is captured outside of the book of jonah rebuilding a little bit this location of gath peter near nazareth in the area that would later be known as galilee makes jonah one of the few prophets who healed from the northern kingdom of israel so we know a few things in building into and i'm building a background of what led to jonah 1 1 you know jeroboam ii is king he sits on the throne as one of if not the greatest king outside of solomon by pure domine of israel although he did evil in the sight of the lord the boundaries of israel had spread to the most expansive since king solomon was on the throne the blessings that would have flowed from abraham all down to that generation about sea possessing the gates of his enemy and where you put your foot is yours and these things were still in force although they were out of order the kingdom of israel was still spreading with jeroboam ii on the throne and with jonah as the prophet this would have been after the time of elijah assyria 500 miles to the east was a constant threat to the kingdom of israel israel constant ups and downs had created an issue with assyria that even the prophet hosea would have spoken of the interaction between israel and assyria even before the time of jonah and had declared that god would use assyria as an instrument of discipline or punishment against israel we can go to hosea 11 we're still trying to get to jonah but i want us to see the background so in hosea 11 and verse 1 we see hosea speaking describing a journey hosea 11 verse 1 when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt so jose is speaking on behalf of god here when israel was a child so when israel was young in the early stages of israel then i loved him and i called my son out of egypt as they called them so they went from them he's describing the sacrifice on the balaam and burned incense to graven images i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that i healed them so here we see god taking issue with the fact that although he was doing things for them they weren't even acknowledging what he was doing for them you see how god takes note of it this is now after the fact he is still taking note of the behavior along the journey verse 4 i drew them with calls of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meat unto them so this is this is not the narrative of reading joshua and reading the people's perspective of what god was doing this is like god's side of the story describing how god is seeing how he was handling them i drew them with chords of a man with bands of love in other words they were out of their bondage i give them love and i was to them as they that take off the yolk on their jaws in other words i was the one who was freeing them liberating them and i laid meat unto them i give them food he shall not return into the land of egypt so god is saying i'm not going to send israel back into bondage but the assyrian shall be his king so hosea is speaking that there will come a time when it will not be the captivity or the punishment of egypt but it will be the punishment of the assyrians upon them why because they refused to return and his return is to return to the lord so anybody who was aware of the scriptures of what would have transpired and as you read through the bible there's this repetition of reinforcing the journey the journey out of egypt the journey through different places and the pathway to reach the way they were so any patriotic loyal israelite would have longed for the destruction of the assyrians because the assyrians would have been mortal enemies to israel and would have been viewed as them who would have been given a mandate to punish israel can we go on so now i'm building into jonah prophets of israel are known to serve god and the people of god this was the job description they would intercede for the people they would cry out for the people they would lead the people in repentance this was expected this was understood this was normal after all you were born into israel your birth would give you access to certain benefits and the prophets who were appointed and placed by god were the mouthpiece of god prophets would bring messages of warning and then judgment with a purpose it wasn't just warning and judgment there was a purpose behind it and the purpose was always about turning the heart of the children to their fathers the purpose was always about reconciliation this was a great responsibility it was a great honor not to be taken lightly right with me we're building a little bit as you study the relationship between god and his prophets it is clear to see that god chooses how and when and what he communicates to his prophets i'll say it one more time it is clear that god chooses how he communicates when he communicates and what he communicates to his prophets but abraham said one time that the angel came to him he hadn't seen him in six months and the angel just looked at him and didn't say a word so i want us to pause and consider for a moment this solemnness the sacredness that comes with that point in time that interruption that breaking routine when the word of the lord comes to a prophet we have spoken about the sacredness the awesome presence the responsibility that will come to a prophet that typically would be a word to bring healing to their people everybody with me and i can imagine the day the hourly minute when jonah was interrupted the pause the alertness the attention the waiting on what god wanted jonah to do and as the lord spoke to jonah i don't know if jonah was taking notes i believe he was just taken into his heart but i want to see the picture i don't know how long jonah was waiting to hear a word from the lord but here it is finally god comes to speak to jonah the hesitation the growing sickening feeling in his stomach the nervousness as jonah processed what god wanted him to do many describe jonah as the unwilling prophet but most don't understand why jonah wasn't willing or what he was unwilling about let's go to jonah 1 1. now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of ametai saying so we know he's same son of amata we know you say him jonah who is who is prophet under king jeroboam the second arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me nineveh is effectively the capital of assyria so the job assignment that was given to jonah was to bring mercy bring judgment bring an opportunity to a people that was not his own this effectively was outside of jonah's job description i want us to process this for a minute this was not jonah being told to go to the tribe of judah or the tribe of benjamin or go this was to go to the people of nineveh and cry against it for the wickedness has come up unto me we will find out later on that this was not a monologue it was not a one-sided conversation but jonah actually was given a response to god when he was speaking this to him jonah had some issues he had some real issues with this jonah wasn't running because he just didn't want to do it there was a reason why he just did not want to be responsible for dealing with these assyrians i want to still process this for a minute when the call of god came to jonah he could not see beyond his issues that he had with the assyrians jonah couldn't understand why god would come to him and ask him to do something that was against everything he jonah believed i want us to process this for a minute almighty god comes to jonah and jonah knows it's god the question is not if is god talking to me the question is not a word of the lord because it's clear and the word of the lord came to jonah the debate is not who was talking the debate is not what god wanted him to do the issue was jonah had a question and an issue and jonah allowed his personal issue to affect what god was telling him now this is massive i want us to process this the question wasn't if is god talking the question was not what the instruction was that was very clear the issue jonah had now this is not a member of a church this is not an elder this is not a deacon this is not a fifo minister this is not a pastor this is a prophet a placed position prophet who and i'll get it later in my notes who hears the word of the lord and has issue with what god once done that's that's that's profound how could god want him to take a message of mercy to the assyrians jonah is there trying to understand how could god have mercy on miami oh my oh my now we cannot how could god send me to bring a word to people who have been out for us how could god send me to bring a word to people who have hunted us who have abused us who have oppressed us our mortal enemies jonah could not deal with it anybody with me so jonah was of the view that mercy and i comment now into the message in a little bit that mercy was reserved for certain people jonah could not process the fact that god and he knew and we read it jonah knew the moment god spoke to him that god was sending mercy to them and jonah listen to me carefully didn't want them to get mercy my lord we we're going to see this scripture this prophet this bearer of the gospel this bearer of the good news because of maybe how he grew up hearing about the assyrians when the confrontation came with his test because this was a test for jonah when the test came for jonah he would have given words to jeroboam he would have did but when the test came for jonah and said jonah now your tests come i need you to display what we would say the virtue of our age and carry mercy and forgiveness to people who are not your own they are not of abraham they are not of israel but i want to give them mercy jonah say i am not with that program you know god loves to interrupt our expectations of how he is supposed to operate oh you don't hear me tonight i'm building it to something god is sovereign he is so sovereign he forces the issue to make you love your enemies he forces the issue to bring mercy and to bring love to the unlovable and at that point in jonah's life he could not reconcile is god that he served to do that act so jonah wasn't running because he didn't want to go he was running because he didn't want to bring mercy to them anybody with me all right let's build a little bit so now the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amitai saying go to nineveh that great city and proclaim judgment against it all right crying against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up so he makes a decision now to flee onto taxes which is like literally tarshish is like the furthest if you study map then this stash is like spain so he leaves the almost the extreme the extremity of their domain he's gonna go as far as he possibly could go to tashish from the presence of the lord but iran i preach a man running from the presence of the lord and went down to dropper and he found a ship going to tashi so he paid the fear thereof and went down into it to go with them onto taxes from the presence of the lord you know how much stuff this word so let me bring another person now the only thing the word wants us to do the word requires us to do that goes against certain things that we hold dear to us so in in jonah's case is what his belief of what should happen i want to see is what should happen of to the assyrians what they deserve the the judgment that they're supposed to get what they're supposed to pay for what should happen to them and what he thought should happen to them all jonah wanted to ascend judgment judgment judgment judgment and god is saying no no it's not so i want you to go and deliver the people and i say listen this deliverance ministry right now is that my ministry i want us to see it now so and the word of god comes to us coming tonight coming every service to challenge us and our closely held beliefs not just about the message and scripture but what god demands from us anybody with me god's expectations of us that may be beyond our comprehension our understanding and our limited perspective of what god wants to achieve anybody with me tonight so let's go verse 4 but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god lowercase g all right so everybody call into their deity and cast for the wares or the goods or the luggage that were in this ship in the sea to lighten it of them but listen to this jonah was going down into the side of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep now you see this kind of sleep this is the kind of sleep when you want to lock up the world it have a kind of sleep that you sleep when when you want to avoid things people go too different you see when you're under a certain kind of stress somebody pressure you and you see you know what let's go and you don't want to so jonah so shut off the external world that are storm shaking all right so that he sleeping so verse six so the shipmaster came to him and said to him what meanest thou o sleeper in other words in the amplified it says so the captain came up to him and said how can you stay asleep in other words the captain is shocked that his ship is about to break and this man so want to ignore his responsibility ignore his calling ignore the the the challenge he has to face that he has wheeled himself into a deep summer so sound so seemingly safe that the captain is perplexed that this man could be asleep and all this russian going on outside arise call upon thy god if so be that god will think upon us that we perish not so these sea men were trying to stack the odds in their favor they did not know which god would answer so they say let us all call on whichever version of god we believe so right now we're missing whoever you believe in because so far we have had no deliverance from this thing so perhaps the god yusuf might be the one who could stop what's going on anybody with me anybody here and they said everyone to his fellow come and let us cast a lot that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and a lot fell upon jonah so whatever they choose to throw around they recognize this thing this thing fall upon jonah then they said unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us and listen i love the questions what is that occupation when's come as thou what is thy country and of what people are dull i love it you see your car get away i almost losing my voice i'm getting excited here they asked jonah listen where's your occupation what is your occupation who are you because you have to be somebody for this thing to be affecting us this way where you're coming from what is your country and what people you're from and he's saying to them i am an hebrew and i feared the lord the god of heaven which had made the sea and the dry land then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why has doubt done this for the knew that he fled from the presence of the from whence coming down where you're going whether he let them know anybody with me he let them know that he was running from the presence of god everybody with me i think i just got disconnected there for a brief moment so this so he had let them know that he was running from the presence of god are you hearing me again yeah okay then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be common to us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous so in other words what shall we do because the sea was becoming more and more violent it says in the amplified so there's an increasing intensity of what is going on so as jonah talking the ps not slowing down it actually getting more and more intense all right and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall they see me come unto you for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon us this great tempest is upon you nevertheless listen so i wanted to note that after jonah told them to throw me overboard verse 13 nevertheless the main road had to bring it to the land in other words they actually did not want jonah said trust overboard and then decide let me roll harder to get out of this thing but they could not for the sea wrote and was tempestuous against them so in other words in the amplified it says nevertheless the men rode hard breaking through the waves to return to land but they could not because the sea became even more violent surging higher against them so their effort to save jonah start to work against them anybody with me all right wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech the o lord we be cg let us not perish for this man's life and lay not upon us innocent blood for doubt all lord has done as it please thee in other words listen we don't want to show this man overboard but it look as if you want to move on board so whatever please you don't hold it against us and verse 15 so they took up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging then the men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the lord so this for them was immediate conversion immediate conversion those men got delivered right there and then at that point was the deliverance the men fear the lord they see as lord the beginning of wisdom fear the lord exceedingly so it wasn't just fear it was exceedingly fear exceeding fear and offered a sacrifice unto the lord and made vows they pledged what they're going to do from that day on as evolved verse 17 on the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights now let's build jonah chapter two then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly now we reach the fish's belly brother branham said jonah was backslidden powerful statement he said jonah there's a direct quote but everybody said in the belly of the wave jonah was backside that blow me away completely because people seem to think that the higher you go in ministry the more immune to backside than you become so i want to bring a thought here that but everybody said jonah baxter this is not an apostle a past study by the teacher this is a prophet still in his office but backslidden but iban said this multiple times still in his office of a prophet god didn't remove the officer from him but he was making bad decisions still in his office and allowing personal issues to affect his judgment what he was going through was the product of personal issues affecting his judgment still in his office check this ignoring a direct word of the lord jonah 2 1 then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me so now jonah now starting to get some level of reconciliation no all right and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heard us my voice for thou has cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods come pass me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me then i said i am cast out of thy sight anybody with me yet i will look again toward thy holy temple so jonah is in the middle of his whale belly experience but jonah is getting in the spirit he is not where he needs to be just yet but he is warming up anybody with me he he now kind of starts in the he in some trouble but he not moping in self pity in his trouble he is starting to realize that he have to do something about his situation he may have messed up but he's not going to let that just get to him he said i cried by reason of mine affliction of the lord and and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and i heard is my voice so he knows he is in communication now he is he is he is beginning to reattach some wires that have been disconnected anybody with me for dow has cast me he's acknowledging that though has cast me to the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods can pass me about all thy billows and thy ways pass over me then i said i am cast out and i said yet yet although i know you're taking me through a process yet i will look again toward thy holy temple thy waters can pass me about even to the soul and the depth closed me around about the weeds were wrapped above my head i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was above me forever yet has thou brought up my life from corruption oh lord my god when my soul fainted within me i remember the lord is there anybody tonight who could give that kind of testimony when my soul fainted within me i remember the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into that holy temple they that observed lion vanities forsake their own mercy but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that i have vowed salvation is of the lord and the lord spake unto the fish i want us to notice it is it is in context when job reached that point where he said i will pay that i have vote i will keep what my promise supposed to be salvation is of the lord and the lord spake under the fish and it vomited our jonah upon the dry land anybody with me i told there's an easy class tonight right and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time now we're building saying arise go on to nineveh that great city so this second time is is now a different journal listen god not finished with him yet but it's a different jonah from college jonah one jonah right this is a different journal the word of the lord came with the jonah the second time saying arise go on to nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bit thee so jonah didn't have his own message the sermon was given to him you see it the preaching that i bid thee so so the message the title the subject the inspiration the scriptures god give him the message and say all i need to do is go and deliver this so jonah arose and went on to nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and none never shall be overthrown verse five so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them this is powerful now right forward came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe with him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his noble saying let neither man nor beast heard nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god this is not tribe of israel people this is gentile people let them tune everyone from this evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell listen to the king would who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not and listen to verse 10 and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he will do unto them and he did it not you you hear that now you can see why jesus could say the people of nineveh would rise up in judgment against the generation because they repented all right so most people have a understanding of jonah to a point but i want to now go to the last chapter of jonah i told you that is an easy class and it is the first time somebody has a job a responsibility a target and when they hit the target they get frustrated they get upset jonah chapter 4 verse 1 but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry oh my whoo this is the first person who hit a goal and get vexed because they achieved success usually when somebody hits what it's supposed to achieve they're really happy that they achieve the goal so this first verse here shows that jonah was preaching and hoping people do repent that's why i call this the mystery of god's mercy because although jonah went through his experience and come out a little better he still had an issue with who god should help oh lord help us he still had a problem with who god should give mercy to so jonah chapter 3 was jonah preaching a message from the lord but in his heart he was hoping oh god i don't wanna repent a preaching repentance a preaching judgment but i don't want him i don't want him to do it along the way isn't it so listen carefully now but it is please jonah exceedingly this is not just displeased jonah a little bit you know he is furious he was very angry and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee oh lord this is where i say that the conversation in jonah 1 1 was not a one-sided conversation listen to jonah's words and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee oh lord was not this my saying in other words at 12 years old when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto so we see now jonah is admitting why he fled he said i told you so and what did he tell god for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slaughter anger and of great kindness and repentance be of the evil so when jonah was given the commission to go to nineveh jonah knew the god himself he said our god is too forgiving he slaughter anger the moment you repent he ready to pull back judgment from you anybody in the house tonight so jonah understood the mercies of god to israel and say if god sent me to the assyrians they too will get mercy because this god i served or changed it doesn't matter who he's dealing with he is slow to anger you you reading this thing you want to tell me god can help everybody listen for i knew so imagine so i want us to rewindly take back to jonah one when the word of the lord came to jonah and jonah getting the word and jonah started to actually answer gordon because he's saying i pray thee was not this my saying did i not tell you lord i told you when i was yet in my country and this is why listen to jonah this is prophet jonah this is why i fled on to tashas for i knew that though out of gracious god anybody know he's a gracious god and he jonah had a revelation that the graciousness of god was not limited to those who were born of abraham by blood jonah had a revelation that the graciousness of god was bigger than what god could do for him and his own people kind of church amen and merciful slaughter anger and of great kindness and repentancy of the evil now listen to how bad it get to jonah jonah's issue with the assyrians was so bad listen to this most people never read this before verse 3 therefore now oh lord take i beseech thee my life from me only thing is joke jonah had an issue jonah said this mercy and graciousness is too much for me to handle kill me take my life from me i can't process this your graciousness is too much these people don't deserve this kind of mercy isn't this profound look how you can have stuff locked up in your heart look how god can deliver somebody and they're in church and you're still looking at them funny oh my oh my oh my and it eaten you up because you don't know how god could turn that person's life around and but they messed up so much and and now they're in church worshiping and and you get a fight with them you cannot you can't even worship you whole service you've ex because they are worshiping god because god wasn't for them and you can't rejoice with them at all because as far as you concerned is judgment they're supposed to get this is not before jonah went into the wheel no jonah went through his own trial still come out of his child and still saying lord i can't deal with your mercy and your grace to them i could accept your grace to me but i can accept it to them oh come on now anybody hearing me tonight jonah was comfortable with acknowledging what god did for him and god's mercy to him but jonah could not deal with god's mercy to somebody else this rips the rug under judging how god could use somebody it doesn't matter what they did or what god used them to do god was pulling the rug in scripture in precedent and in jonah's world of how he could reach out to anybody despite what the assyrians had done to israel god went to the capital of assyria and turned around the heart of the king and all the people there now prophet jonah have his issues imagine heaven rejoicing because people repenting and jonah the prophet go and having a mind battle and having now suicidal thoughts verse 3 therefore now oh lord take ibcg besieged means beg it's not just a request he begging the lord take i mean it's easy my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live then the lord then said the lord do as thou well to be angry you know in in other words do you have a reason to be angry in other words what are you upset about i am sovereign i choose to redeem them i choose to restore brother so and so i choose to restore sister so-and-so i put their name on the book you don't know what name they have on the book you hear angry because i blessed them i want i want this to go deep enough because jonah was not allowed into the mind of god considering the assyrians so his limited perspective of the plan of god was limited to his understanding of what amos said and hosea said and the history and what happened in the message and what happened 20 years ago and that he was in that church and he didn't believe and he have a fourth doctrine and all this stuff kind of jonah had jonah ready to die verse four we almost done short class easy class abc class then said the lord do as thou well to be angry so jonah went out of the city jonah so disturbed he cannot stand to see these people rejoicing and free and liberated that the word listen the message and what does the paradox say you preach a message see people at the altar delivered see people set free and you walk out the building because you can't believe they repented the message you preach bring deliverance and you outside the building of vex that people are crying out into the lord so jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a boot and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city so jonah there waiting for them to undo undo their repentance oh i done i done tonight you see why god has to walk with all of us what would become of the city in other words jonah is there trying to figure out what would happen would they repent what god said judge them he's still looking for some measure of judgment and the lord prepared a god which is a plant and made it to come up over jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so jonah was exceedingly glad of the god he planned but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smote the god that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a vehement east wind that the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and wished himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live so you will recognize that the story of jonah nineveh and what happened is really the second plotter is ready jonah is the issue here jonah is this is the book of jonah for a real reason because it's jonah just like job where the the job one man and the man at the end of job is two different men god already dealing with a prophet and the fact that prophets have to come to maturity just as god can tell by the random you need to be more sincere that is why your faith cannot rest on man you have to trust god you have to pray that god bring all of us into maturity verse nine we're almost done and god said to jonah do his though well to be angry for the god and he said i do well to be angry even unto death so in other words jonah is now vexed that the plan gone so israeli jonah already have some issues that god trying to help him out through it then the lord said though has had pity under god for the witch dog has not labored in other words you didn't plant it neither made us it grew which came up in a night and perish in the night and should not i spare nineveh that great city wearing a more than six core thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and all so much cattle and that's how the book of jonah ends so god was showing jonah one you can't question me two how you could be angry now you're angry about a plan that you didn't put in place so god was saying to him is i raise this city up you know if i want to deliver them i could deliver them so i want to kind of close this session out to encourage and kind of just bring out some highlight points out of this in closing on the surface on a surface level we see jonah a man running from the presence of god we call him the unwilling prophet almost grudgingly or being good and in a very surprising twist in the story as it were becoming actually visibly angry when he is successful at his task his mission his mandate his job of turning the people of nineveh around the people of assyria the ninevites were enemies to israel so god's command to jonah was against as we said everything he believed in it was nothing that he expected he would be ever called to do so he was being challenged to do what he never thought he had to do and jonah even as a prophet had trouble reconciling the word of god concerning his mission because of his personal issues this challenges us all to look at what personal issues decision thoughts feelings we have that actually hinder us achieving the mission and the mandate that the world gives us our accomplishment this day apart from the fear that jonah would have at what the assyrians could be or should do jonah by the time you read jonah iv his deepest fear which is which is really a paradox his deepest fear was actually the fear of success because jonah understood that if the people repented they would be shown mercy so jonah was preaching with our almost self-sabotaging agenda you know you struggle sometimes with wondering if people are really happy for you and here it is jonah until god was finished with him was operating and really hoping that these people don't make it through really really powerful to really think about jonah understood that the god he served as we read it before is a gracious god merciful slaughter anger of great kindness and will repent of evil once people repent i challenge us tonight in so many different ways one many of us running from the presence of god running from the accountability of god running from the word of god and deeper than that are the issues in our lives that hold us back from achieving the purpose of god i'm finished tonight like i said is a short introductory class back to bible study tonight let us bow our heads forward of praying our gracious heavenly father lord we thank you tonight for this short teaching tonight on the mystery the divine mystery lord of your mercy this mystery of the mercy of god that is tied to sovereignty the fact that you are sovereign god you could deliver who you want to deliver you could set free who you want to set free you can show mercy to whom you want to show mercy and lord we have to check ourselves because it's so easy for us to put our perspective and thoughts on how people should be judged and who should be judged and what god should do or shouldn't do how he should act and lord we see jonah struggling with how you wanted to show mercy to who would have been as it were the enemies of israel lord even as a man on a mission he secretly was wishing for failure as it were being upset when people actually turned around and was shown mercy and lord how lord you would redeem jonah as it were and tie yourself to him and tie yourself to that moment when jonah was in the will as a type of lord of of of your lord death burial and resurrection that in the divine plan of god you was using jonah lord just as you use so many characters through scripture lord we looked at how true matthew 1 lord you use so many lord lord you use rahab lord you use tamar you you use all these different broken people as it were to help bring life and hope and redemption to other broken people lord we can't even judge jonah tonight lord because he was part of a divine plan but we want to take a lesson tonight to look in our hearts lord to check what makes us hold back what makes us do certain things lord against your word and your will you sent a prophet to us to tell us how to go how to prepare and lord help us to have bigger hearts as it were to be more inclusive lord to not have our perspective on how you should move and how you should operate lord and to trust you lord to know that you could deliver anyone from any situation lord because you showed it here you even delivered the enemies of israel lord you brought freedom and deliverance to mortal enemies as it will help us lord as you challenge us when you are on the earth that our mind it is to love our enemies to do good to them that despise us to turn the other cheek as it will it's a powerful message of forgiveness and redemption and restoration and of your goodness and your gracious god a merciful god help us to have that kind of mercy help us to be slow to anger help us to be of great kindness and lord help us to be quick to lord repent of evil and to let things go may you be with it one tonight may you touch your people lord in this little bible study tonight lord may you minister to families to homes to situations lord if forgiveness needs to happen in a home may that forgiveness take place if peace needs to come in a home may that peace take place may you bless the service lord tomorrow night and the prayer meeting on friday and the service is coming sunday lord be committed people into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen may the lord richly bless you tonight thank you for being a wonderful audience have a wonderful night we love you and appreciate you god bless you richly
