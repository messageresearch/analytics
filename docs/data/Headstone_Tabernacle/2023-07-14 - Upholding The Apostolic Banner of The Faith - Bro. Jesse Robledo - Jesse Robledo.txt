the wonderful musicians and all the ministers from a board not fair uh may God bless you all richly and we just bring a little grit in from the word of God our words will fill and um but God's word will never fail and I just want to take a short portion of scripture found here in Saint Luke chapter 4. uh familiar scripture where man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that is what the word is what gives us the feet Faith coming by hearing the word of God amen and the scriptures say Jesus and Luke chapter 4 Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being faulted is tempted of the devil and and in those days he did eat nothing and when he were they were ended afterwards he hung God so what led him into the Wilderness we know this is his son in whom God was well pleased brother that was the lamb coming to be washed brother that was the word coming to the prophet John animal Jordan brother Heaven and Earth hogged and kissed Hallelujah it was a great experience only body boxer Jordan John said behold ilama God Christ was correctly pointed out Hallelujah he was correctly identified brother that the bride wouldn't miss him amen and brother G John said I have need to be baptized of G and Jesus said suffered to be so far become at us to fulfill all righteousness so as a bride of God many things we will understand but we fulfill the word of God hallelujah when that great event took place the eyes of that great Eagle Hallelujah met the eyes are journal what an experience that was in the water at that time Hallelujah and brother The Voice the heavens was open and the spirit of God descended like a dove and said this is my beloved Son Hallelujah this is the one and whom I'm well pleased and that Spirit we know the dove always leads us into battle so the dove immediately led the eagle Into the Wilderness to be tempted for what it is Hallelujah we know Forte is a judgment number Hallelujah but Forte also at the end of 40 days a lot of things come out Moses and Imam for 40 days a lot of Revelations came out at the end Hallelujah so the end of your trials there's a great Revelation coming forth and at the end of those 40 days brother he was a hunger the professors when we really fasting with God we can't get tired we don't get hungry but at the end of The Fast brother the devil was entitled to a punch and he came and Jesus being a perfect man he was a hunger Hallelujah and the devil came to him and he said no if thou be the Son of God if thou be he didn't really know the ministry was now starting he said if God be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread Oh Glory not if thou be the Son of God he was the son of God Amen brother he was the son of Abraham as his son of Abraham he was heir to Palestine the Royal Grant amen as the son of man he was yet in yet as his son of David he's here to Detroit brother and a son of God he's here to All Things Hallelujah all things was under his feet amen brother Jesus then clung for the Devil the devil then hallelujah he didn't know the power that was locked up inside of him that was Emmanuel God in flesh with us hallelujah and Jesus now at the end of the 40 days he resorted to the one and he told Satan Hallelujah now Satan quoted the word c-o-a-t hallelujah he tried to court the word brother body Bride quotes the word q u o t e Hallelujah we go back to the world amen and Jesus went back to the word at the end of the 40 days in Deuteronomy chapter 8 in the Old Testament Moses was showing them that God allowed you all to to sojourn these 40 years in the wilderness all right so Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 2 thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God let these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove he to know what is in thy Hut so it wasn't that God didn't know but he allowed the test to see what is really inside of you and all that didn't believe the word the characters perish in the wilderness isn't that right look at it God's bread is now proud bride he humble them and suffered into hunger she had a thank God for hardships because true hardships and help you to be more humble Paul was given an informative flesh to keep him humble because of the abundance of Revelation to keep the humble Hallelujah and February Egypt didn't have manner Oh Glory which don't know it's not neither did I find us know that he might make it to know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord that man left Hallelujah so look at this at the end of the 40 years of sojourning this scripture came out man shall not live and at the end of Jesus Is 40 days fasted the scripture came to life again Hallelujah so it is of great importance to us and not just the same scripture we're saying said Luke chapter 4 verse 4 is the same scripture in Matthew chapter 4 verse 4 so Matthew brother presented him as a king brother Matthew 4 4 is the same thing man shall not let my brother Lord look who presented him as a man man shall not let my brother alone so it is of importance to us Hallelujah so you cannot satisfy a spiritual fight with a natural meal Hallelujah not bread alone but by every word that every word that proceeded not proceeded that proceeded it is continuous tense Hallelujah that word is still proceeding today brother we need the word made flesh Hallelujah that is Christ today proceeded out of the mouth of God that man LED man shall not live who is man Hallelujah man was the first man that was made was Spirit man it cannot be tempted that theophony cannot get hungry so that is not the man he was talking about Hallelujah but this man that is trapped this is the pesos this can get hungry but there's an inner man locked up inside of here for as much emphasis as we place on the outer man there's an inner man that will take care of that man Hallelujah you see man man was made only sixth day isn't that right six is an incomplete number all right sexual suffering you will work six days but the seven talk of arrest six years they were labor six years they were planned but when his seventh year is The Lord's release six is a number of men if you're lucky in the Bible brother they had the statue that the bell of Daniel that was an image to a man it was 60 cubitai by six cubits wide so six was the image of a holy man that was he popped back then but we see the pope down in place of the Son of God he sits on a seat and his numbers add up to six six six six sixes incomplete but God sent a power to come back 666. he sent us brother William Marion Branham 777 to come back 666 [Applause] the believer when the believer dies the highest we could go is in his sixth dimension all right boys I believe when we die it's in his sixth Dimension but God is in the servant so there's something called into the servant right now we are living in the sixth day brother but he's seven days just ahead where there will be no more tears no more path no more sorrows so the seventh is calling us glory be to God in the highest you're watching Prophet Suffering The Prophet suffered all his life but this girl was only six inches long he always looked for the seven inch of that animal and your sixth note came down and it's just Queen the mother dreamed brother but the seven Dove is the one that brought the healing so that man is a supernatural man he's incomplete and what completes a messy word of God need the word of God to live by Hallelujah man shall not lay thy bread alone but by every word we need the word present tense and this bride brother is a eighth zebrae just to close quickly you know what that means every letter the alphabet running your finest Pride brother she abides by the word [Applause] upon the word all right it's a bit difficult for those it comes up so the letters in English is this bread abides by the word hallelujah she is Anointed by the word oh glory be to God in the highest being she is born by the word isn't that right where is our birth in the word of God we're not born by Creeds we are a word pride amen see she has called by his name she is called by the word doesn't the word call you Hallelujah it is calling us to come up higher tonight we receive our correction from the word see amen see she has dedicated to the word of God Oh Glory Peter her Dynamics is found any word of God is she is the word of God she is edified by the word of God Hallelujah she said full to the word of God even aren't you Faithful called Chosen and faithful brother she's fortified by the word it's not right the word is our fortification Hallelujah the word was like fire any prophets born he said I won't talk no more but the world is like fire in US Oh Glory gee we are Guided by the word thank God for a guide hallelujah it's brother we hold on to the word Hallelujah by his word I am healed glory be to God we walk in harmony with God's word David said Thy word have i hidden my heart that I won't sin against thee I we are identified by the word you were to Define our identification in the word of God Hallelujah inspired by the world Oh Glory Jay we are justified by the word Hallelujah the word judges us and bring brother the end that old serpent that all desires he brings it under subjection in our lives okay we know what he once done with his word hallelujah Glory glory be to God the bride keeps his word she lives by his word she loves this word she lines up with this word glory be to God she's a manifestation of the word of God today and a brother her name as any word oh she is obedient daily word Hallelujah she's obligated to the world and that only P brother she's purified by that word she's a prisoner to that word she's pregnant by that word she proves his word today Q she's quickened by that word all glory be to God in here yes oh she's a reflection of that word she starts reproach for that word she recognizes his word oh Glory s she's submitted to the wording she speaks his word she stands for his word she's Sanctified by the word she scares what the word she's stimulated by the word this is Try by the word hallelujah she's transformed by the word you she is United under the word foreign she is filled by the word of God Hallelujah I mean she's Vindicated by the word of God you she's Washed by the word hallelujah X you're no word for X but she's the word express glory and why she's your to the word she's yielded his word and said brother she's zealous of that word hallelujah her eyes are zeroed in on that word may you

fight to get here and uh but I am waiting for that call from prison to power oh yes oh yes oh yeah so but anyway I've done taking care taking over the actual prison house it took over prodiper's house by the grace of God and God is still working so we'll see amen but I want to greet you all all my Minister friends that have come from around the world it is certainly a great privilege for me to see you once again and I trust that before the meeting is out I get a chance to at least greet you and Shake Your Hand um we are here for a real I believe a special appointment with the supernatural what good would it be if we were here and he did not come would just be gathered uh you know saying hello to one another but I'm looking for that angel to come Among Us amen and do the things that he promised to do especially in this day in hour where the restoration of the original faith is Promised Amen in this day this is not a message of Wesley Luther he did not have this message amen this is our time our season amen our inheritance by the grace of almighty God Amen so what can we say about our precious brother uh Peter Chandler God richly bless you amen what a masterpiece I'm always blown I'm always under anticipation uh when brother Peter Chandler speaks because uh he's deep you know in his own way he has these slides he says it's for the young people brother Chandler is for me amen I enjoy it amen so it makes it a reality so I I certainly do appreciate uh your church and everyone I mean I could be here all night but you know I was so blessed to hear this young Minister come forward and I said well it gives me less time to speak and he could actually speak all night long if he wanted to Amen to I know my pet I know my place and I know my limitations I'm not as young as I used to I'm a little slower amen so perhaps maybe tonight a little shorter in fact I hope so because I think dinner is after and I don't want to lose anybody amen remember how brother Brown was talked about the cathedral Cathedral Vision the cathedral Forest he's preaching and preaching and preaching preaching people got restless and tired he got hungry they left and he said where are you going amen people just laugh because they're getting hungry and but here's what I told the church last week he said you know the angel told him don't worry they'll be back they'll be back in the evening time he said because I haven't struck my climax yet amen that climax is gonna be strong [Applause] and God's people everywhere will be present those that are predestinated to be present God richly bless you thank you musicians I don't know I think this is probably one of the best musicians that I have ever had the Privileges of I I I've often said as I get older I like to sing but I'm kind of intimidated these musicians are just a little too uh good for me so but maybe we will try one day so greetings to all I bring greetings from our little church in Valley Stream New York um the original Faith Gospel Tabernacle greetings from my wife sister Rebecca she had what I've loved to have been here and our people but we are we are a small group waiting for the coming of the Lord I like when brother Branham would greet the different ones in the Rapture tape there's a group over in Arizona this group way over there waiting for the coming of the Lord another group over there waiting for the coming of the Lord amen so no matter how bigger or big your group is just make sure you're waiting for the coming of the Lord that's the most important thing so God richly bless you amen once again if I forgot any anything or anyone uh I please forgive me and I was I wanted to say this I I haven't seen a good friend of mine in a while brother Lino Dorado I saw him just the other day God bless you brotherly no wherever we we've trans he's translated for me for many many messages around South America and God willing although my time is limited in travel uh I trust and pray that God will open doors for me to return to South America and if it's just a weekend or two then it would be worth it I love the people in South America amen and around the world because they have been so good to me and sadly I you know you have to live uh and you have to work to live I always say it's a thing you live to work and work to live and and so therefore God knows all things so therefore we are unhappy I am a happy person I'm going to tell you something because I've told the Lord I said I am not complaining about the cross I just ask you to help me to Bear the cross amen as long as I have to work for Pharaoh may he be gracious to me and I know that God will us take care of the rest so I don't want to keep you long I just have an hour message or so it's already 51 minutes I have it counting down and uh so God bless you we'll turn right to the word and we are uh so blessed to be speaking on this great thing of the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I like the brother who said it was delivered once I'm going to say that again it was delivered once and brother brother Branham said that Paul once he laid the foundation he himself could not fool his own church because the foundation was laid and the word says if me or an angel comes speaking any other thing let him be accursed amen the foundation was laid so we have got to find those landmarks we've got to find those uh promises that pertain to us and and nail them down amen and content for them amen so Ephesians chapter 4 and we'll have you seated is Ephesians chapter four we're going to start with verse 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace and ironically this uh word endeavoring means to earnestly try to succeed and to strenuous strenuously uh to make a strenuous effort and Earnest attempt so this is what we have come to do to contend and to earnestly content for this Faith because I will say this that that faith is here now just waiting to be released we're often say that okay uh it's coming and you know and just we put things off uh at long distance but you know brother Brown said one day we'll be standing sitting preaching and love will come down and all that is wrong will be made right amen what is that that uh you know that perfect faith and remember perfect faith the faith rapturing faith is all the same thing uh Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God it is impossible to please God with our faith so he had to have rapturing faith Amen in order to be found not amen so uh there is one body so let me just start there there is one body one Spirit even as he are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of us all who is above all and through all and in you all may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us have a word of prayer our heavenly father we have come Lord to this place and this portion of the service Lord which is a preaching of the word Lord we are absolutely helpless unless you come down and speak through our mouths and use our vessels dear God to speak something that would be uh anointed to your people Lord and we know that anyone can read this word but unless the spirit follows this word and make it alive to the people then it just sits on Stony grounds or Stony Hearts whatever but father I pray my prayer dear God is that you would uh every seed that would go forth May a find good ground May the people water it dear God and apply it to their hearts and their lives and say this is mine because you promised it and Lord may we push feelings aside may we push thoughts aside dear God because we realize right now our surrounding this assembly surrounding this house there are deeming powers all over wishing that they could enter in to this place but they cannot because there's too much power in the house of the Living God Amen but they try to make us doubt they try to use our minds to question your word father May a perfect Faith drop down tonight dear God in such a way where the cripples will walk in the blind will see and those that are captive dear God those that are depressed an oppressed Lord I pray that they would find a freedom and a liberty that they have never experienced before a father God for he who the son of man has set free is free indeed and we know that we are in that time father God land possessing time so we ask Lord God that you would Grant the things and do the things that you promise to do Lord and we know because we are believers father God and that takes Faith to operate their God your gift and your word we believe in your word the father we pray Lord that by the time the service is over May our hearts say did not our hearts burn within us Lord and everybody dear God go with their portion back to their respective places Lord and may we truly say oh my God the Holy Spirit did speak to my heart amen tonight and it's something special for me we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated for a title for just uh 45 minutes I have now upholding the apostolic Banner of the faith upholding the apostolic Banner of the faith and I got this inspiration by I was I was driving to one of our sites that we have we have plenty of sites and I have the tapes on all the time and then of course sometimes I have to pull over to the side and and jot a couple of notes and just put that over to the side but brother Branham uh brother Ovid put out the announcement and he was talking about the uh the faith amen uh original faith and he said uh here's the quote that brother Branham uh actually um it was on the actual invitation or the actual video that was made of the invitation Jesus never questioned when he came back would he find respects although many seek respects they want to be respected people it's okay I often said if Jesus made himself of no reputation then what respects do we really have yeah but he was obedient to the cross so he never questioned whether he'll find Saints which he probably would find you know self-righteous people and things like that and he never questioned whether he would find righteous but what Jesus questioned whether he'd find or not is what I'm trying to uphold so I like what brother Peter Chandler did this morning there's a lot of things I'm gonna I guarantee you by the time this convention is over you're going to know everything about uh the faith the original faith when the son of man cometh willifying faith and the faith Etc but brother Peter Chandler come from a different angle here and a little different anger and I'd like to perhaps come a little bit from a different angle it's still the faith now amen so but brother Branham said this is what I'm trying to uphold so the real question that I would like to ask he said he says this is what I'm trying to uphold will I find faith when I come back and then he said that Faith uh in the message faith is a substance so we have something to uphold for too long the message has been trampled on and I'll be honest with you uh in general the message is more divided than it has ever been and brother Branham never taught that you know that so we're listening to another voice somewhere and so we have to understand that when a country sends their uh people their military their Fighters to War what do they have they have a flag and everyone unites around a flag and uh and for a while everybody has their own little Flags into different individual states to have uh all kinds I'm not even going to go into that because I don't have the time you know they have all kinds of beliefs all kinds of little Flags but when War comes they have to unite under one flag amen and when they go into the enemy's ground then they're United knighted under that one flag you see that's the banner in which we are and we have to withhold as long as we uh expect to be a United Army we have to fight under that flag you may come from a different Church you may come from a group you may come from with a denomination amen your flag is not the representation where people will fight under we've got to be United under one head and that head is Jesus Christ and that head is love that head is Charity praise God and charity never fail us amen whether it be tongues as shall cease whether they be prophecies they Shall Perish and they will cease to happen but charity never failth amen so if he sends his army out he's going to have to send them under the correct banner and love conquers all let me say that again love conquers all amen Love Will Conquer The Bull praise be to God Amen the bull had a plan to Amen to run into brother Branham and to flip him over and give him a couple of thoughts but when that bull ran into that atmosphere of love amen he ran into a cement wall of love praise be to God there's something about love amen when the bees amen went you know when brother Branham and I love how brother Branham uh you know he he lived and he could speak to Creation you know he had that kind of experience with God Amen when he was mowing the lawn and he accidentally uh ran over the Beehive and the beehives were the the bees were upset about their High being uh destroyed and you know knocked over and so forth oh they were angry you know and you know bees make beehive to make honey amen you find the best honey in the beehives and so forth amen but when they went over and began to surround brother Branham you all know the story I'm not gonna get into detail amen they ran into the sweetest honey that they ever [Music] [Applause] oh ho ho ho ho ho ho they ran into the sweetest honey that they have ever experienced in their life amen because that is a charity the amen that has got to be uh the bride has got to be Anointed with charity Love Will Conquer All Things love is the answer and we're gonna come down to a quote here just the minutes if the Lord will permit is that it shows that without love you cannot have faith so if we are if we are striving for that perfect love if we're striving for a love that Faith the original faith we cannot get there without having that perfect love impossible impossible amen hallelujah see and I like what brother Brown says in the message here God's preparation the kingdom of God shall rule how many believe that amen listen we are not working with I said just a few moments ago temporarily I am working for pharaoh amen but that's not my kingdom I belong to another kingdom amen that is where I I earn a living hey amen but that is not my kingdom Hallelujah even Jesus said when he was speaking to Pilate and pilate asked him amen he said to you so you're a king he said you have said it you have said it you see and he a pilate thought he was smart you know amen listen and he said if I was a king and my kingdom was of this world man would fight for me in this sign but my kingdom is not of this world listen if men would not fight for Jesus because he had no Kingdom on this Earth I'm not fighting for nobody because my kingdom is not of this world I fight for Jesus Hallelujah I contend for the faith praise be to God amen amen the kingdom of God shall Rule and reign as might down every nation every flag I live in New York and I'm by uh with every periodically go by the United Nations that building you know how many flags are flying uh in front of that building and every nation is represented by a flag amen and there's so many Flags uh and yet within that uh Nation there are so many little Flags within the major plague brother Isaac I almost was tempted to ask you can I can I get you get you to bring me a Trinidadian flag I wanted to illustrate something to you because the thing is no matter how much we unite under a flag there are other little little Flags that to people is more important now I am not talking about politics because I don't believe in politics I have one flag that is a bloody bleeding Lamb of God flag amen the robe of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but you have these policies politics politicians and so forth who are hypocrites oh yes you have to fight for our flag you have got to do this and that the other amen no that is a lie amen I fight for no Nation amen my kingdom amen Jesus said the kingdom is not of this world and I'm going to tell you something we as fifo ministers must preach a kingdom or every action our Behavior should be Kingdom based [Applause] Hallelujah should be Kingdom based is it good for the kingdom not good for my church not good for my group amen is it good for the kingdom because a true faithful Minister amen he has an objection amen objective amen he is called amen until we all come to the unity of the faith amen he's working for the kingdom he's laboring for the kingdom he's preaching for the kingdom until we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God amen hallelujah and don't you tell me there's no Holy Ghost to be had oh no no no no no no no you're too late devil there is a real Holy Ghost to be had by experience amen I'm saddened sometimes What I Hear amen all you have to do is believe amen just write your name on a book amen you no longer have to boohoo and cry at the altar amen you know what I have to tell you that is a devil that's the devil amen because brother Branham said amen you have got to receive the Holy Ghost by an experienced that you and God know s Hallelujah that's why churches come back and they're packed out there's no more tearing there's no more or whatever amen listen remember the Palmer worm the caterpillar is always working to take away but listen I'm here to uphold amen the apostolic faith the original faith brother Branham said if God would not permit his own mother into flesh and so forth not that he was his own mother but he God used Mary to Bear Jesus if he would not permit her to go to heaven unless she went up to the upper room and receive a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost Revival in her soul amen the Holy Ghost is what does it it's what makes the difference I've been preaching the Holy Ghost for over 40 something years and I still believe it I believe it today as a as it was a first day praise God that I appreciated hey amen there is a holy ghost to be had amen hallelujah amen do you believe that I feel I'm preaching to Believers amen glory be to God yes sir amen I can never be deceived by something like that no sir it is impossible amen because the seed of God listen uh our precious Brother Thompson have preached a message for in our church just before coming here he says only the predestinated will be considered for Redemption [Applause] let me just say it one more time only the predestinated will be considered for Redemption and you look around and you say well why me if you are predestinated you are considered for Redemption God is not asking you whether you are good or whether you are sinless or whether you did not fail amen you are considered for Redemption and Redemption is to bring back to a original place where you fell from Hallelujah oh Blessed Be His holy name [Applause] others are not considered so you pray and you pray and you pray and you wonder Lord what is going to happen what is going to happen to these Believers all we can do is pray because the program of God will continue we have no authority to to cast anyone out or bring them in that's not our we're not in charge of God's Redemption plan hallelujah oh no no no no that's up to God your car can take the violent sinner amen God can take somebody come on now you don't hear me God can take somebody that you think oh no that person is never ever ever ever gonna make it amen well God will turn around and do something for that individual set him on fire set her on fire praise be to God Amen there'll be better Christians in half of us here today when you receive the mercy of God and the amazing grace of God there's something that happens on the inside you become more appreciative don't take advantage of the grace of almighty God if God has poured out grace to you we should never come to service one service without thanking God because we owe it to him we owe it to him we're trying to make up for lost time Hallelujah amen and when God puts you through a trial amen listen he doesn't feel sorry for you that's part of his Redemption stop crying [Applause] remember job oh he was I mean he lost everything and I mean this was a tough trial now he lost everything in a matter of one day his family everything his wealth he lost it all he was down on laying on his ass sheep and he was ready to curse God and die what happened every single morning I gave offerings to God to amen for my family for my everything amen and God come down one day job was having a pity party and naturally in probably you know Justified you know he was feeling bad but God had a question for him this is why I say God does not feel sorry when he's testing you [Applause] because he knows that you're going to be a better person when you're done so why should he feel sorry for you [Applause] he asked job one question and that question was where was thou when I lay the foundation of the world and the sons of God was shouting for Joy where was thou listen job I don't even want to know where you are now I'm not asking you where you are now but I was uh what I'm asking you where was town God is not interested where you are now but where was thou oh Hallelujah and whenever you get a revelation amen that you come from God and you're going back to God brother amen can a devil stop you from returning back because you are considered in Redemption oh Hallelujah to the lamb hey [Applause] hey [Music] Hallelujah to the lamb oh when he got a revelation he got up from the ash Heap amen he amen he dressed himself like a man he walked different he talked different why Revelation makes a difference Revelation makes a difference when you get a revelation of Who You Are then the devil will never stop you Hallelujah all kinds of devils will come against you to try you the brother was speaking here if thou be a son of God you can imagine date you know Satan's been around a long time huh it's been around a long time and he know that went pay way back in the first Adam said you know he saw Adam do that he saw Adam do the works of God but if you be the son of God turn these stones into bread why did he ask that is because he saw it before he saw somebody do it before Hallelujah Adam amen was a God on Earth do you understand that we live many times way below our privileges we think sickness is normal we think our backaches are normal we think covet is normal oh no no no that's Devils that are trying to take over this Earth is polluted and you know it brother Branham said hey God does not have to destroy man man will destroy himself oh yes he will but you see here's the thing we are going back we're going back to our original condition you may be seated so the main question I like to ask you amen what are we upholding we as ministers I trust I wanted to just everybody I'm talking about everybody not just ministers we all have brother Branham said in discernment of spirit that if you want to know what a minister a person if you want to follow somebody if you want to put your shoulder to the wheel find out what his objective is what is he trying to achieve for the kingdom not for his church for the kingdom see because here I'm stressing the ministry of Jesus Christ of Ephesians chapter 4. and there's been a lot of impersonations and a lot of teachings on Ephesians chapter four but I'm going to tell you something these individuals who are actually true fifo ministers have one purpose and one purpose and heart and that is the kingdom of God [Applause] and I don't know if you know this or not but a true faithful Minister can Minister Universal his ministry is effective universally you know why because he's sent to the body of Christ and the body of Christ is universal Hallelujah Universal I'm so happy to see amen people that come from everywhere amen enjoying everybody's welcome everybody is welcome everywhere we go everybody is welcome amen we're not crazy people we love this message we preached the promises of almighty God we believe in a prophet Hallelujah we contend for the same faith we may disagree here and there but it's still we should be still United under one head because we are fighting a common enemy you are not my enemy I am not your enemy brother Brandman was talking the other day and said you know if you had a bunch of people in Missouri shooting the Indiana and the the Hoosiers and so forth and the devil will stand by and just look and just wait for you to kill each other he has nothing to do you know why because you're killing one another and then when you finish killing one another he'll just clean up what an easy battle that was I don't even have to do anything amen so we've got to stop fighting one another that's what I preach that's what I believe I vow I will love my brother so the main question what are what is it that we are appalling now brother Branham says here now let's get uh I have 20 minutes as I promise 21 minutes I represent the faith this is a a quote that brother Brown says here and God has a provided way and now we're moving right uh right on into another great age brother Branham was looking for this age now way back in 1954. but he says something so profound so mind-blowing that he never I I've checked it out but he's never quite said it this way before but he made a point he dropped this seed for you and I tonight amen he said uh and now we're moving right in uh on into another age the coming of the Rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of restoration of gifts see restoration of gifts he said and it stumbled many of their big fine churches it sent nazarenes backwards in May frenetics of a lot of Pentecostals amen but just the same see God is not responsible for people that fall back and get confused about the program of God he's not responsible for that he's responsible to keep his word remember only the predestinated are considered in Redemption see it's it's set Nazarene backwards and made Fanatics out of Pentecostals but just the same God is moving right on bringing in rapturing faith for his church that's right rapturing faith and it'll take those seven unknown Thunders brother random said amen what we have now is not enough to actually transform this body amen into a position that we can be translated now Enoch had it Enoch is your perfect type in the Bible there's no other type not Elijah no other Ty Enoch is your perfect height because Elijah although he was translated and so forth not transl taken up into fiery horses and so forth that he has to come back in Revelations to experience death Moses body was uh he died and the and the angels hid it and of course we know that there was a great debate as to a great fight over his body but Enoch he walked with God and he was found not listen one day you're you're not going to be found you're not going to be found Hallelujah amen no the FBI will find you CIA won't find you the Secret Service here and the island won't find you you know why you'll be so far past the moon past the start Pat you're going to a place where they cannot follow you oh Hallelujah it was a rapturing faith you see and Enoch had this testimony that he pleased God and the Bible said it is impossible Amen to please God without faith so so Enoch had that kind of translation Faith so uh so now let's continue so just the same God is moving right on bringing in the rapturing faith for the church that's right so tonight I represent that faith [Applause] the faith that was once only once delivered to the Saints in a way of a Divine gift so the Divine gift that God gave brother Branham and told him that no one else will have it was the gift of the faith because you can't impersonate that this is why brother Bram said no one's going to have it as long as I'm alive and the other people who's going to have it or the Bride of Jesus Christ because it's not going to be impersonated you're going to have to die out like he died out you're going to have to live like he did Amen in order to have this gift from God [Applause] Hallelujah brother if that'll make you happy I don't know what will amen by way of divine gift amen which to my opinion gifts and columns he says is not my opinion but the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance there's nothing you can do about it see God gives it to you you're predestinated in other words let me explain this to you God knows every single person that is going to be at that wedding supper in fact he knows it so well your name is already written on the seat reservation no one can sit in your chair [Applause] do you know when you have wedding ceremonies and so forth and the bride and the bridegroom they get they have mind battles where are we going to put this one and what we and you have placement cards and when they come in the guests oh where am I sitting and they're looking for their name they're actually looking for their name so I'm here to tell you God has placed your name [Applause] already reserved and let me give you another word of encouragement amen oh that the father has given me will come I'm not gonna lose one I don't care what the devil's telling you amen if you come from God you've got to go back to God again Hallelujah to the lamb amen why you are a part of God [Applause] oh my do you realize that you have seen you're already over the devil do you realize that how many knows that before the devil was I am you are [Music] you were you were away before there was a star a moon whatever you were in God's in the back part of God's mind and the devil has limited memory you know although you think wow he really can remember 20 years that's nothing you may have done something 15 20 30 years ago amen and he wants to bring that up to you amen as though it happened yesterday oh because he has a vivid memory but you know what what's so beautiful is that he fails to realize that uh we go way back way back I think I've said this before in Trinidad but we go way back before there was a moon before there was a star and you know as a train as it were the Redemption train going way back way back way back after a while the devil has to jump off that train because he was not represented in the back part of God's mind [Applause] and your name ends up in the blood section of the book your name has been transferred from The Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life where your marriage certificate your wedding certificate is laying dipped in blood [Applause] you know in the judgments when the books are open amen and God has to oh God is the only just judge you know amen no man can judge you because he doesn't know all things only God knows all things he has recorded all things except those things that have been erased by the blood of Jesus Christ so when he says you did this you did that you did this so don't you remember you did that okay let's play the video tape and here you have an attorney your attorney is Jesus Christ [Applause] father or he's speaking to the judge okay uh I claim that this man is innocent okay present your case well play the tape and there is nothing absolutely blank on the tape so then that Jesus Christ who is your attorney he then becomes also your judge and slams The the gavel down and says case dismissed saved by grace praise be to God oh Hallelujah I represent that Faith by way of divine gift amen so you realize amen the prophet represented the Faith by way of divine gift now listen rapturing faith perfect Faith the faith the prophet had uh I have 11 minutes amen it was all wrapped up in the Capstone of love that we all see here why did Brother Branham say that nothing but perfect love will make it there nothing but perfect love now here's what I want to say you have to forgive if I told you that you have to forget I would be preaching false Doctrine because only God can forgive and forget brother Brown said that he's he's not made us that way and the only reason we remember is for a lesson it shouldn't change our character it should still make us uh forgive regardless but I'm going to tell you something you'll be very dumb to walk in the same trap because you've learned nothing we forgive but we don't forget amen only God can put your sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness and remember them no more and that is only a benefit to the Bride of Jesus Christ every one of that's not in the land's Book of Life their sins will be remembered oh Hallelujah to the lamb amen hallelujah amen what time is it don't worry about I have to worry about it amen amen so now listen okay thank you brother Isaac listen now this is this is uh something I want to bring over there's only one gospel one message we all have gathered under this roof here today one message one gospel not two Gospels not two messages not uh version a b and c of of the message one message delivered by one prophet Malachi 4. amen Saint Luke 17 30. amen Revelations 10 7 and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and every believer in this message should say Amen to that you're flying your own little amen so therefore establishing the kingdom of God the biggest chance we see the coming can I say that again Kingdom Menace they're very it's not a shame of a good old-fashioned experience they're not ashamed to come down to the altar amen and and cry out to God with with I remember years ago in the revivals people would run up amen oh God Jesus have mercy on me amen and there was nodding from the nose and everything and nobody was concerned about that because they had opened their hearts to God Almighty amen and God was listening and God filled them with the Holy Ghost and Fire what we need today is a good old-fashioned heartfelt holy ghost devil chasing true blue red hot bloodboard Jesus Revival you take the holy ghost out of a church that church died that church gets cold because the Holy Ghost is the blood in the church you take the blood out of the church that church dies there's no more forgiveness of sin there's no more nothing amen it turns cold and starchy you can't even get them to raise your hand you take the blood out of a man you do I have to no you don't have to amen but have you seen your name in the Lamb's Book of Life amen nobody can help you but nobody can put your hand down Hallelujah to the lamb it's important to God it's important to God that we receive the Holy Ghost by experience it's important to God amen because that is amen the actual formula repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to those that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and if you have faith for yourself then have faith for your children [Applause] I don't care if your child is back sitting amen apply the token for them amen one day Peter was resting on the on the rooftop amen and there were a bunch of a gentile Cornelius you know the story amen they were considered in God's sight although they were Gentiles they were righteous people you know why because they prayed always God loves When you pray God will amen amen prayer breaks the barriers of all kinds of oh this group that group well you start to praying earnestly where your prayers comes up to God God is going to remember your prayers amen and you think GPS just came uh uh you know a few years ago no GPS today is an impersonation of what God had years ago [Applause] how many know that to be the truth hey amen oh sure sure amen they were waiting and praying to God and and the angel had come down to Cornelius go find Peter go ask for Peter you'll find them in such a such a street and so forth he's a Peter the Tanner and so forth told him exactly where to find Peter [Applause] now Peter we all have a Peter inside of us God has a way of of of sometimes we don't listen right away but if you notice with God God dealt with uh with Peter in threes threes all the time Peter slayney no I've never eaten anything that's unclean wow Peter and Jesus loved Peter you know here comes the second time Peter slay and eat no wow did Peter think he was going to get away with that that the Angels get offended said okay that's it I'm not going to deal with no brother Bram said if God tells you to do something you might as well do it because somehow one way or another you're gonna do it you can run but you cannot hide but at the third time a man Hallelujah Peter finally understood that there was a need there was a deep calling to the Deep there was a need people needed to be filled with the Holy Ghost and that's how it worked on the day on on the in Apostolic times amen and he told them listen there's gonna be this is God knew Peter there's going to be people at your door don't ask questions no more questions just go amen because there was a need Amen to the Gentiles that group that gathered together amen and guess what uh when they finally made the connection through GPS God's global positioning system amen told them where to go amen and he knocked on the door said okay I'll go because I was already told that you'll be coming for me amen so he went now if God if that was the end of the story that would be the end of the story amen but there was something that needed to be fulfilled the sea germ was in Peter's body and I don't care how that much they fight this listen the seed term is in the bride somewhere somehow somewhere don't you tell me God don't fill with the Holy Ghost anymore amen the seed word seed germ is in the body [Applause] and while Peter yet spake the word the Holy Ghost fell upon them they spoke in tongues amen amen they were filled with the Holy Ghost praise God Amen and they were oh Peter was perplexed wow how can these Gentiles amen received the Holy Ghost as we have received them but I'm going to tell you what we've got to learn how to be a little independent whenever you have to call somebody from somewhere else another country is it okay to do this that the other no Peter had no time Peter heard from the angel the angel told them to go they're never said oh hold on let me let me get a hold of people in Jerusalem see what they think about it if he had done that he would have never gone because whenever you get men involved I'm going to tell you something Hallelujah they will ruin the program of God listen to the angel we're going to have to learn how to uh listen to thus saith the Lord whether you call headquarters or no headquarters listen I have no headquarters I'm so thankful the only headquarters I have is Jesus Christ amen when he tells me Amen brother bran said all they needed was a nod from God Amen and off they went praise be to God Amen of course so then he went back later on and explained to the the apostles in uh Jerusalem and they all uh understood it because they were one in Vision one and purpose one in Doctrine should not create a division so here is my oh I've already sorry your kingdom this Kingdom Jesus Kingdom is not of this world don't so don't try to please anybody in this clean Kingdom or in this world our Focus should be Kingdom focused kingdom of God base Jesus himself had a kingdom see but it was not of this world and in John 18 and 36 Jesus speaking to pilate he said my kingdom is not of this world and if it was and if my kingdom were of this world then would my servant fight that I should not be delivered Amen to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence so therefore if they did not fight and Jesus did not want them to fight because Peter pulled his sword out and cut one ear and Jesus and his grace of the temple guard he took that ear in healed that uh the ear of the temple guard he didn't want you to fight especially one another we're brothers we're coming to The Headstone now the coming of the Lord is at hand we have got to be so much like Jesus Christ until the bride and the bridegroom are united together we're blending in so don't tell me about your Doctrine don't tell me about all your Revelation unless it comes back to this I'll say good thought you know why because my Bible says there's one body we're all baptized into that one body amen one Lord not three how did we divide them all what what what what what part of the message are you in it should not be part of anything it should be in Christ Jesus Christ you see one Lord One Faith one baptism see so I'm here to preach unity and I hope that you understand one God one father amen of All Above All and through us all praise be to God see now I'm going to close I all right here here's what I want to say love produces faith I'm closing love produces faith not Faith love you have to love first before you can have faith we're talking about perfect Faith we're talking about the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen we've got to love first the problem is is that oh well I will apologize when they do it first you'll be waiting for a long time but the Bible tells us we love him because what ah when we were unlovable he taught us when we were unlovable when we were not even thinking about God he loved us then and if he did that why can I so therefore I don't care go back to your church go back to say I love you my brother I love you my sister and mean it in your heart mean it in your heart I will guarantee you're gonna feel a whole lot better because the devil don't want you to say that or do that you see you'll feel a whole lot better you see and I'm not telling you as I said I'm not telling you oh yes just forget about everything in it yeah don't in other words don't let your memories affect you saying I love you see because that's the devil but say it with all your heart and do it with all your heart see so therefore you could join all the churches in the country anywhere you want it and make all the confessions you want but there but if there isn't genuine real Holy Spirit born again love in your heart your faith is in vain oh no matter how much you confess that you believe God that you have nothing uh that has nothing to do with it has got to be born in the human heart then you've got eternal life can never be separated from God oh my let me close with this okay you can stand to your feet I want to close with this amen because we're all I told the church I've heard many messages I've heard many wonderful powerful sermons anointings that would come down and yet you wonder what will it take for a real true Unity of the faith you wonder sometimes only God can bring a Unity of the faith and it can only be be based on his word you see no good lesson no good sermon can bring the unity the faith see it will take the Dynamics it'll take the renewing of your mind and your heart and your spirit amen to be in condition to receive now brother Brown said this and I'm believing it to this day 1957. I believe it's coming a time where Paul said where there's prophecies that shall fail where their tongues they shall cease I believe it's coming to a time till when the saints get together like this and just a love spirit will just sweep over the audience and just every person in there oh that's wrong will be taken out he said this back in 1957. see It'll be such a presence of the Holy Spirit so it'll take the presence of the Holy Spirit to do that and to transform us because we need to be inoculated yeah we have gone through the pandemic we've gone through a lot of things but the sickest body that brother Brown said he knows is the body of Jesus Christ and he's a real baptism of love so never forget this when we're striving for perfect love when we're striving Amen to come back to the original faith amen we've you we cannot eliminate the most important thing that is love what did now I spoke and at Harrisburg just recently about landmarks how the landmarks were set by our forefathers see and the Bible says don't move your neighbor's landmark whatever you do don't move that's an offense you know so for too long landmarks have been moved around and I want to say this that that brother Branham you may argue with me but I'll have a scripture to show you brother Branham didn't come to set new landmarks he came to reveal those that have been already established by the forefathers Hallelujah because it had been buried for so long you've taken this is why who was that was smoking a cigarette and or pipe or whatever Luther whatever and drinking everything they had to measure it but they had to work at that time amen but they didn't have a perfect word see but it's coming to Perfection coming to Perfection now amen he come to reveal the landmarks and now we know what belongs to us we perfectly know what belongs to us and I'm gonna tell you in case you forgot adoption is ours Perfection is ours rapturing faith is ours seven Thunders is ours the Seven Seals is ours Hallelujah every promise that was promised to be revealed is ours is our inheritance it falls within the boundaries of our inheritance Hallelujah this is why I'm going after it by the grace of almighty God amen don't you move your neighbor's Landmark whatever you do amen God richly bless you I ran out of time amen I'm sorry I have kept you a little later than than usual [Music] [Applause] [Music] when brother Branham made it to the other side let me finish with this this is why brother Bram said when he got over to the other side he wanted to see Jesus and of course he couldn't see him because he was in another dimension and he asked one important question will Paul's group be judged you remember that huh well so yes yes he'll be judge every group will be judged but he was specifically asking us well Paul the original landmark the one who said if me or an angel come preaching any other thing let him be a curse Hallelujah and he said well praise God I preach what Paul preached [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah it didn't matter uh about anyone else he said I preach what Paul preached because Paul laid amen the landmarks of the Apostolic Church amen there's a song we
