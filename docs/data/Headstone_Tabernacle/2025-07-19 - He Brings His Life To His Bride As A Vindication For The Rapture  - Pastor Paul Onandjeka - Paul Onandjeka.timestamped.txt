[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; This is our church.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate pastor?
[1:03:35] We love him. We do appreciate it.
[1:03:40] From our hearts,
[1:03:43] you know when we were in Abigan,
[1:03:47] there were many miracles and
[1:03:51] during the convention, the Easter
[1:03:52] convention.
[1:03:54] It was so glorious.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:59] Christ. Praise God. We glorify
[1:04:03] and we magnify.
[1:04:06] What can we say
[1:04:08] we so far
[1:04:14] love? It was wonderful. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:19] and brother coming behind.
[1:04:24] Bless him. Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; What can we say about our elder
[1:04:40] in a mighty way? Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] You may take your Bibles
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; in the book of Genesis 1 verse 26.
[1:04:54] It read this wise. And God said, "Let us
[1:04:57] make man in our image,
[1:05:00] after our likeness,
[1:05:04] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:05:05] of the sea, and over the fall of the
[1:05:08] earth, and over the cattle, and over all
[1:05:12] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[1:05:14] that creepeth upon him." So God created
[1:05:18] man in his own image,
[1:05:20] in the image of God,
[1:05:23] created him male and female,
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:26] And God bless them. And God say unto
[1:05:29] them, "Be fruitful
[1:05:32] and multiply, and replenish the earth,
[1:05:36] and subdue it,
[1:05:38] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:05:40] sea, over the fall of the air, and over
[1:05:43] everything
[1:05:45] that moveth upon the earth."
[1:05:49] Let's go to Colossians chapter 3
[1:05:54] reading from verse 10.
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:09] that created him
[1:06:20] where there is neither Greek nor Jew
[1:06:23] circumcision nor circumcision barbarian
[1:06:27] bound or free but Christ is all and in
[1:06:30] all.
[1:06:41] Put on therefore as the elect of God,
[1:06:44] holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,
[1:06:46] kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
[1:06:49] longsuffering,
[1:07:00] forbearing one another, and forgiving
[1:07:03] one another. If any man have a quarrel
[1:07:05] against any, even as Christ forgave you,
[1:07:08] so also do ye. Let us bow our head.
[1:07:13] Almighty God,
[1:07:16] bless the word that we just read.
[1:07:19] Bless every believer,
[1:07:22] take me out of the way, Lord.
[1:07:26] Speak through me to this church, Lord.
[1:07:29] Bless Pastor Topulus.
[1:07:32] We love him. with our heart
[1:07:35] and receive all the praise, all the
[1:07:38] glory in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:07:41] pray thee for thy own glory.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:07:47] What a message.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; What a time we are living in. This is a
[1:07:53] glorious time.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; This is a wonderful time.
[1:07:57] I have a little message.
[1:08:03] He brings his life to his bride
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; as a vindication for the rapture.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And as an inspiration, the supernatural
[1:08:15] is in this. And we have seen this
[1:08:18] morning
[1:08:20] and we saw him yesterday
[1:08:24] seeing God in action.
[1:08:27] because he's alive.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; What can we say
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; about our elders?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Pastor Toposit.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; What can we say about Pastor Raymond
[1:08:43] Thompson?
[1:08:49] These people, these men are our
[1:08:53] we
[1:08:56] And we do appreciate them likewise with
[1:08:59] all our hearts.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Brother says in the seven church ages,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; he say all the ministry
[1:09:10] is about the supernatural.
[1:09:14] How can people say that they are
[1:09:17] Christians
[1:09:20] and then deny the supernatural?
[1:09:23] Because our God,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; our creator
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; is supernatural.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Elohim
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; is supernatural.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is supernatural.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:43] in the queen of
[1:09:46] he said through all the ages
[1:09:48] God had men
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and he had also his ministry
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; in every age
[1:09:58] God
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; is supernatural
[1:10:02] and if you believe
[1:10:04] if you believe in all our ages
[1:10:07] can you dance
[1:10:09] and give a hand of praise to Jesus Yes,
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; they are our elders.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And you must give them respect
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; because when they were believing this
[1:10:26] glorious message,
[1:10:28] they were not even born. Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And you must and you must respect them
[1:10:36] with all your heart.
[1:10:39] When pastor
[1:10:45] when they were believing this message,
[1:10:48] some of you were not yet born.
[1:10:50] So we have to respect them and we
[1:10:54] believe in them and no demon
[1:10:58] can separate us from those
[1:11:01] no matter who is they can never
[1:11:06] separate us from
[1:11:08] Because we have the vision
[1:11:11] and we had the revelation, no man. No
[1:11:15] matter who he is
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; can never separate us from our elders.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:26] Blessed be the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:11:29] bless the name of Jesus.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And we believe that God is real
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; and he is God
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and he's alive.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it right
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; in this message?
[1:11:48] He said, "Now check the anti-dolivian
[1:11:50] wars."
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; When God rose up
[1:11:54] and then he stretched out his hands
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; a world that he created,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; he created heaven and earth.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; He created man.
[1:12:06] He made everything
[1:12:09] according to his great miraculous plan.
[1:12:13] And the life of God is in man. The life
[1:12:17] of God is in man.
[1:12:21] Can I hear an amen?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; The very life of God is in man.
[1:12:28] When you look at the stage of the
[1:12:30] perfect man, the faith of God, the
[1:12:34] virtue of God, the knowledge of God,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; the temperance of God, the precious of
[1:12:40] Jesus, and the godliness of Jesus and
[1:12:43] the kindness of Jesus when it is in you
[1:12:47] and then you are a candidate, you are a
[1:12:50] candidate for the rapture and no man and
[1:12:55] no man
[1:12:57] can dissuade you.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; You are a candidate
[1:13:02] for the rapture.
[1:13:04] Give me an amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Can I hear your amen?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; My God. Mount you.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:13:18] Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; 537
[1:13:20] watch
[1:13:25] is coming to the spot where the life is
[1:13:28] in the body
[1:13:30] which is the vindication.
[1:13:34] The rapture is near
[1:13:36] that. The rapture is at hand.
[1:13:40] When you see the head
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; and the body,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; the headship
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and the body
[1:13:48] becoming one.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And the fullness of the measure
[1:13:53] of his manifestation
[1:13:55] shows
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; that the body
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; is about ready
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; to be received
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; through the headship
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; to be received
[1:14:07] through the headship
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing your amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] See what I mean?
[1:14:19] He has be to give life unto his body.
[1:14:24] The one that he has redeemed,
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; the mediatorial work is done
[1:14:32] and is bringing his life to the body
[1:14:35] as authentication
[1:14:38] for the rapture.
[1:14:40] When you have his life in you, when you
[1:14:43] have the life of God,
[1:14:45] And then you are vindicated
[1:14:48] for the rapture and no man, no minister,
[1:14:54] no man can can take you back.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; You shall be raptured.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You shall be raptured. Then no demon,
[1:15:04] no power
[1:15:06] can dissuade you.
[1:15:08] You shall be in the glory.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; You shall be in the glory. Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Can I hear your amen?
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Give me an amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; I feel religious.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Have I have I not sent you? Paragraph
[1:15:30] paragraph seven he say this.
[1:15:36] He said, "But the Greek word that is
[1:15:37] used
[1:15:39] for eternal life,
[1:15:43] it is the same life meaning the life of
[1:15:46] God." The same word meaning the life of
[1:15:48] God. It is the Zoe.
[1:15:51] He that has eternal life. It is Zoe.
[1:15:57] God's own life
[1:16:00] that makes you
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; his own son
[1:16:04] his own daughter
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; because you are born of him.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; The life of God
[1:16:12] is in you then.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; The life of God is in you.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:16:20] The fedication
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; of the rapture.
[1:16:24] It is the statue of a perfect man that
[1:16:28] is in you. And then no, no sickness
[1:16:34] can dissuade you there.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And then the life of God is in your life
[1:16:40] and every demon,
[1:16:43] every demon
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; will be under your feet.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Every demon
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; under your feet.
[1:16:54] And if you believe it
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; and then you can stand up
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and you can shout a man
[1:17:01] because it is his own life. It is not
[1:17:05] your life. It is not your life. It is
[1:17:09] the very life of God. It is the life of
[1:17:12] your father. It is his glory. It is
[1:17:15] authority
[1:17:17] that is in you that is in you. And every
[1:17:21] demon
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; will be under your feet.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Every sickness,
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; under your feet,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; every demon

[1:25:01] no demon can hold you down.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; I said this convention
[1:25:07] 2025
[1:25:09] is a supernatural meeting.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; And then if you believe it,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; I say stand up then stand up where you
[1:25:16] are and then open your mouth
[1:25:20] and give me an amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; I said this conventional
[1:25:25] is supernatural.
[1:25:27] No matter your condition,
[1:25:30] no matter your sickness, you are healed,

[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; the supernatural is there,
[1:26:17] the supernatural
[1:26:20] manifest itself.
[1:26:22] When you see brother Tom,
[1:26:25] many healings
[1:26:27] in the ministry. Likewise, brother,
[1:26:30] many healings,
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:34] many healings in the ministry,
[1:26:37] but they are humble and simple men. They
[1:26:40] are humble men. They are humble men. But
[1:26:44] God is using them mightily
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and gloriously.
[1:26:50] No demon.
[1:26:52] It can't hold them down. They are
[1:26:54] anointed.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; They are anointed men and they are our
[1:26:59] elders.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; They are our elders respect
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; and I I I give them respect and then no
[1:27:06] demon can hold them down. Can't hold
[1:27:10] them back. They are sons of God. They
[1:27:12] are sons of God. If you believe it
[1:27:15] right,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; give me an amen.
[1:27:19] In this message,
[1:27:22] the queen of the south paragraph
[1:27:24] paragraph 21.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Now God
[1:27:29] throughout the ages
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; has always manifested himself
[1:27:34] through supernatural
[1:27:37] ask
[1:27:41] every reader of the Bible.
[1:27:43] All the theologians
[1:27:46] that are honest,
[1:27:48] they will tell you
[1:27:50] when the supernatural is present, it is
[1:27:53] the presence of God. It is his presence.
[1:27:57] It is the glory of God. It is the
[1:28:00] dynamic. It is the anointing
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; and it is charity. It is Jesus Christ.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; That is you.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; It is convention.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; You are healed. You are delivered. No
[1:28:14] demon
[1:28:16] can hold you back. You are anointed.
[1:28:20] Anointing is in your life.

[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; When he manifest himself,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; it is by the supernatural
[1:28:37] and he is doing it because he loves
[1:28:41] he he love to separate the believers
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; from the unbelievers.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; The believers
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; from the unbelievers.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; You are a believer.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You are a son.
[1:28:56] You are a son.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You are a son.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And you are a child of God.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Stand up.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; And shout amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Oh you.
[1:29:18] A church
[1:29:20] that doesn't believe in the supernatural
[1:29:23] will die.
[1:29:25] But you you believe in the surprise
[1:29:29] because the life of God is in your own
[1:29:31] life.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; This is the life of your of your father.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; This is the life of your God.
[1:29:38] This is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:41] that is growing up
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory,
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; glory to glory.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And then charity
[1:29:50] will come down in your life.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And then you shall be adopted.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; You shall be glorified.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; You shall be glorified.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You shall be lift up. And then no demon

[1:30:15] taking God at his word.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that man
[1:30:22] when he's born of God,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; he becomes a son of God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; The supernatural power of God
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; dwells in him.
