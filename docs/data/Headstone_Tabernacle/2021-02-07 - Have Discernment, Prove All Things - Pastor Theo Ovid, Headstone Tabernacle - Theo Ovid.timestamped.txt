[32:10] uh first john chapter four i want to
[32:12] read verse one one verse there
[32:14] and first thessalonians chapter five i
[32:17] want to read from verse 14 to 23.
[32:26] first john 4 1 says beloved
[32:30] believe not every spirit but try the
[32:33] spirits
[32:34] whether they are of god
[32:37] because many false prophets are going
[32:40] out into the world
[32:42] i read from first thessalonians five i'm
[32:45] going to read from verse 14.
[32:48] now we exhort you brethren warn them
[32:50] that are unruly
[32:52] comfort the feeble-minded support the
[32:55] weak
[32:56] be patient toward all men see that none
[32:59] render evil for evil
[33:00] unto any man but ever follow that which
[33:03] is good
[33:04] both among yourselves and to all men
[33:07] rejoice ever more
[33:09] pray without ceasing in everything give
[33:12] thanks
[33:12] for this is the will of god in christ
[33:15] jesus concerning you
[33:16] quench not the spirit despise not
[33:19] prophet signs
[33:20] prove all things and hold fast that
[33:23] which
[33:24] is good abstine from all
[33:27] appearance of evil and the very god of
[33:30] peace sanctify you holy
[33:32] and i pray god your whole spirit
[33:35] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[33:38] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[33:40] may god bless his word let's pray one
[33:43] more time father we thank you for the
[33:44] scriptures
[33:45] you know what's up in my heart this
[33:46] morning lord and i pray that the holy
[33:48] spirit will take it
[33:49] and and speak to the people father take
[33:51] me out of the way
[33:52] i may they hear direct from you this
[33:54] morning in jesus my ask it
[33:56] amen you may be seated god bless you and
[33:59] thanks for coming out
[34:00] praise god what a time what a year 2021
[34:06] 2020 was one for the books i guess
[34:08] everybody was looking for an exit
[34:10] out of 2020 but we still we're still in
[34:13] that channel of
[34:14] of getting things together and god is
[34:17] good
[34:18] and this year for the oldest night
[34:20] service we had the gates of hell shall
[34:22] not reveal
[34:23] against this last day bride and i
[34:25] believe that would have been still some
[34:26] level of confidence that god will take
[34:28] care of you
[34:29] and the battles that you're in right now
[34:31] is only temporary all what you go to is
[34:33] temporary
[34:34] if you could only see that temporary
[34:36] trials temporary discontemporary
[34:38] just temp oh praise god you're fighting
[34:41] to live and you're living today
[34:43] oh hallelujah and then we have another
[34:45] message but isaac divine strategy
[34:47] versus principalities powers rulers and
[34:49] spiritual weakness
[34:51] then we have the bright reproach for
[34:53] believing this revealed promise of
[34:55] dynamics

[42:12] prove all things that's the title this
[42:14] morning
[42:15] have discernment prove all things
[42:19] and have an inspiration a spiritual
[42:22] awakening to this illness that's the
[42:25] inspiration of spiritual
[42:27] awakening to this illness
[42:30] so the prophet was talking about woman
[42:32] bob and here and so on like that
[42:34] he said we need to discern it by the
[42:35] word the word is right
[42:38] take god's word god word is always right
[42:41] we can't deserve by what people think
[42:43] what intelligence tells us
[42:45] what psychiatrist tells us we have got
[42:48] to go by what god says
[42:50] man channeling by bread alone by every
[42:52] word that proceedeth the mouth of god
[42:55] not designing the lord's body many are
[42:57] weak and sickly many are asleep
[42:59] spiritually dead the last plague that
[43:01] hit egypt was dead
[43:03] the last plague they are going to hit
[43:04] the church is spiritual that they are
[43:06] books on faith but they're dead
[43:07] they're going into the church but
[43:08] they're dead spiritual that you're not
[43:10] the same amen but they're dead
[43:12] there's the last play you have to run
[43:14] from that you know
[43:15] run from spiritual death you know you
[43:17] want to know you're alive unto god
[43:19] you're quickened unto righteousness
[43:21] you're quickened to the word
[43:25] every time i come behind this people are
[43:26] fighting for my life
[43:28] are you running from death are you
[43:30] running from the normal
[43:32] casual i don't want to be like that
[43:33] that's why you go too far back 20 years
[43:35] ago that too far
[43:36] i want to know what god doing last night
[43:39] i want to know what god doing this
[43:40] morning
[43:41] i can't afford to go far back he's the
[43:43] same yesterday and today this morning
[43:45] i don't have tomorrow i have right now
[43:47] no faith is i
[43:48] do have yesterday yesterday go on
[43:51] tomorrow i don't know what couldn't take
[43:53] training out may have an earthquake
[43:54] tomorrow but you see though
[43:56] you see right now i could get healed
[43:58] this morning i could get delivered this
[44:00] morning
[44:00] fire could shut up in my bones right
[44:03] this morning
[44:04] yes yes yes yes yes you can get a
[44:05] revival in your system this morning
[44:08] right now
[44:09] oh give the lord a praise offer
[44:13] all right what we needed today
[44:16] is a spiritual awakening a spiritual
[44:19] awakening to this woman prophet said
[44:20] that
[44:21] now here we go our eternal destination
[44:25] is not all together determined by what
[44:27] we see
[44:28] or what we hear but it is determined
[44:32] on what discernment we have of what we
[44:36] see
[44:37] and what we hear so eternal destination
[44:40] is based upon the designment
[44:42] of what you see and what you hear you
[44:44] see that woman
[44:45] at the well when she came to jesus
[44:48] she said our father and this and she
[44:50] talking religious talk he said go call
[44:51] your husband
[44:52] she says sir and she when she tell him
[44:54] when he told her about her condition she
[44:56] says sir
[44:57] i perceive you a prophet oh glory to god
[45:00] and jesus tell her i that's speaking to
[45:02] you am he
[45:04] he reveal himself to a prostitute woman
[45:07] oh glory to god and leave them church
[45:08] members all by themselves we'll give the
[45:10] lord some praises
[45:11] you know why her name is in the book and
[45:14] she has a desert meant to know
[45:16] she was a predestinated seed not by her
[45:18] flesh
[45:19] not by a spirit but what was inside her
[45:22] soul
[45:23] and i cash out and i can't praise god
[45:28] you've got to be kidding
[45:32] is the greatest message to strike the
[45:34] earth
[45:35] look how much of them false prophets
[45:36] still have a bunch of people following
[45:38] them
[45:39] all over the world false prophets dead
[45:44] false
[45:46] hear one of them said not because the
[45:47] man prophecy fault he's a false prophet
[45:51] so not because a man like another liar
[45:54] not a man still a man stealing another
[45:56] teeth
[45:58] the prophesied force but another false
[45:59] prophet force
[46:03] false prophets are not people any
[46:06] message following their foolishness to
[46:07] you
[46:09] yeah yeah like i keep donald trump and
[46:11] same trump
[46:15] god is not a republican as i might see
[46:17] the devil only republican
[46:19] and satan only democrats
[46:23] pick one you know i said
[46:28] satan running democrats and the devil
[46:29] running the republicans
[46:31] pick one they are crazy mucho loco they
[46:35] plumb off the beaten path hallelujah
[46:39] so watch your discernment of what you
[46:42] hear
[46:43] and what you see so this morning service
[46:49] i hope it addresses three things for you
[46:54] three things three specific things
[46:57] one it make you stop what you're doing
[47:03] it makes you continue what you are doing
[47:06] or what makes you change what you are
[47:09] doing
[47:15] there are some things you will know you
[47:16] have to stop then stop it
[47:19] if you're in position and engage
[47:21] continue
[47:23] and if you know you need to change it
[47:25] say
[47:26] god put it in me to change it
[47:31] so every service should bring you to
[47:34] that
[47:35] to examine yourself on second
[47:36] corinthians 13 5 says
[47:38] examine yourselves whether ye be in the
[47:42] fate
[47:42] prove your own selves know ye not your
[47:46] own selves
[47:47] how that jesus christ is in you except
[47:49] to be reprobates but i trust that he
[47:52] shall know
[47:52] that we are not reprobates now i pray to
[47:56] god
[47:56] that you do know evil not that we should
[47:58] appear approved
[48:00] but that you should know what is honest
[48:03] though we be not
[48:04] though we be as reparates for we can do
[48:06] nothing against the truth
[48:08] but for the truth for we are glad when
[48:10] we are weak and we are strong
[48:12] this also we wish even for your
[48:13] perfection therefore
[48:15] i write these things being absent least
[48:17] being present i should use
[48:19] sharpness according to the power which
[48:21] the lord had given me to edification and
[48:23] not the destruction
[48:24] find me my brethren farewell just paul
[48:26] speaking
[48:29] be perfect be of good comfort
[48:32] be of one mind live in peace and the god
[48:35] of love and peace shall be with you
[48:39] that is paul speaking could we say amen
[48:42] now let's run that scripture in the
[48:43] amplified
[48:44] and you'll see a fuller meaning of it
[48:47] paul was saying
[48:48] examine and test and evaluate your own
[48:52] selves to see
[48:53] whether you are holding to your feet and
[48:56] showing the proper
[48:57] fruits of it test and prove
[49:01] yourself not christ do you not yourself
[49:05] realize and know thoroughly by
[49:07] increasing experience that jesus christ
[49:09] is in you
[49:10] unless you are counterfeit disapproved
[49:13] on trial
[49:13] and rejected but i hope you will
[49:16] recognize and know
[49:17] we are not disapproved on trial and
[49:20] rejected
[49:21] he said i pray to god that you may do
[49:23] nothing wrong
[49:24] not in order that we our teaching may
[49:27] appear to be approved
[49:28] but that you may continue to do it right
[49:30] so he's saying it's not that you've
[49:31] indicated over teaching is right
[49:33] but he wants you to continue doing what
[49:35] is right he said though we may seem to
[49:37] have failed
[49:39] and be unapproved for we can do nothing
[49:42] against the truth
[49:43] not save any party or personal interest
[49:45] but only for the truth
[49:47] which is the gospel but we are glad that
[49:49] when we are weak
[49:51] unapproved and you are really strong and
[49:54] this we also pray for your all-wrong
[49:56] strengthen
[49:57] and perfecting your soul so paul was
[49:59] saying in other words this is not about
[50:01] me
[50:02] even if i am weak i want you to be
[50:04] strong
[50:05] i want you to be approved i want this
[50:08] thing for you
[50:09] and that is why i said the fifo ministry
[50:11] is not for themselves
[50:13] is that what men are saying on the
[50:14] throne is for the perfection of the
[50:16] saints come on now
[50:17] for the work of the ministry come on now
[50:19] for the idea
[50:20] you are so important to god go to the
[50:22] fine man
[50:23] beat them up roll them over fix them up
[50:26] to
[50:26] get that word to you give the lord a
[50:28] show
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:35] let me escape what is his inmate
[50:39] the ability to decide between truth and
[50:41] error
[50:42] right and wrong the ability to think
[50:45] scripturally
[50:47] search the scriptures judge everything
[50:49] by the scriptures
[50:51] and that's why i said prove all things
[50:53] and we'll fasten that which is good
[50:56] training
[50:56] [Music]
[50:59] this here's something to run with it not
[51:02] investigating to prove it
[51:04] but our responsibility is to prove all
[51:06] things and if a good holy fast don't let
[51:08] it go
[51:09] that that grip you hold it fast isn't
[51:12] that right why
[51:12] because many false prophets have gone
[51:15] out into the world
[51:16] many thousands because false prophets
[51:19] are spiritual
[51:20] when them spirit fallen and 400 prophets
[51:23] elijah they almost
[51:24] line a line spirit as permission to drop
[51:26] on all of them
[51:28] and when all of them get the same
[51:29] anointing all them provide the same
[51:31] thing
[51:35] the importance of discernment
[51:39] hallelujah that he wouldn't be misled oh
[51:42] my
[51:43] so therefore discernment is not just
[51:45] between right and wrong and error and
[51:47] truth
[51:48] this true discernment not is only
[51:51] distinguishing between right and wrong
[51:53] or good and evil it means distinguishing
[51:56] from what is important from what is most
[51:58] important
[52:03] this distinction assists you in
[52:05] prioritizing what you do now
[52:07] for what you leave later that is what
[52:10] this evening is all about
[52:12] how could we give the lord some praises
[52:16] this difference this discernment
[52:20] makes show you what is temporary and
[52:22] what is permanent
[52:24] so you can decide what you want to put
[52:26] your vote on what you want to put your
[52:27] strength on
[52:28] isn't that right it means between
[52:30] distinguishing good and better
[52:32] even better and best between good and
[52:35] perfect
[52:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah between church
[52:38] member and bride that's his ailment
[52:40] oil and oil is what you want hallelujah
[52:43] you must have it isn't that right
[52:46] and the psalmist david in psalms
[52:49] 1 1966 says thou has dealt well with thy
[52:52] seven to lord according to thy word
[52:56] okay let me just get that back
[53:01] one second only good psalms
[53:06] 119 and a 66.
[53:11] teach me good judgment and knowledge
[53:14] for i have believed thy commandments
[53:18] and the amplified he said teach me good
[53:20] judgment wise
[53:21] and right designment and knowledge for i
[53:24] believe
[53:25] and trusted and relied on and clung to
[53:27] your commandments
[53:29] oh hallelujah so this is a prayer that
[53:30] david had and this is a prayer that you
[53:32] must have
[53:33] to give your designment oh glory to god
[53:36] in
[53:37] all areas of your life if some husbands
[53:39] have diseasement they want to treat
[53:41] their wife differently
[53:42] if some wives had discernment they might
[53:44] have responded to the husband
[53:45] differently
[53:46] and things might be different in that
[53:47] very home you need discernment
[53:49] that's why the bible talks about
[53:50] dwelling with a woman with wisdom we
[53:52] need discernment
[53:54] or give the lord some praises glory to
[53:57] god
[53:58] you need these certain men to see if
[53:59] that is the right business partner to
[54:00] get
[54:01] because someone as crooked as you could
[54:03] get or give the lord some praise as you
[54:05] need the hand of god in your life
[54:07] praise god the right person to choose
[54:09] the right person to respond to
[54:11] you need discernment or give the lord
[54:13] some praises
[54:15] hallelujah in all areas of your life you
[54:17] need it
[54:18] glory to god amen hallelujah praise
[54:22] god certain discernment it doesn't mean
[54:26] judgmental it doesn't mean that because
[54:29] matthew 7
[54:30] 1 jesus said judge not this is in red
[54:32] that shall be not be judged
[54:34] for with what judgment you judge you
[54:35] shall be judged and without
[54:37] measure ye meet it shall be measured to
[54:39] you again
[54:40] and why be holy though the moat in thy
[54:42] brother's eye but consider it's not the
[54:45] being that is an own eye
[54:46] hold those heads to thy brother let me
[54:48] pull out the mood of the night and
[54:49] behold a beam is in thine own
[54:51] the hypocrite who has cast out the beam
[54:54] out of thy own eye and though shall see
[54:56] clearly the castle remote which is my
[54:58] brother's eye
[55:00] so this in the amplified says do not
[55:02] judge and criticize and condemn others
[55:04] so that you may not be judged and
[55:05] criticized and condemned yourself
[55:08] for just as you judge and criticize and
[55:10] condemn others you will be judged and
[55:12] criticized and condemned
[55:13] and in accordance with the measure you
[55:15] deal with others it shall be dealt out
[55:16] to you
[55:18] oh glory to god so that has been
[55:19] judgmental but what he's talking about
[55:22] i'm continuing wrong
[55:22] in verse six now give not which is holy
[55:25] unto the dogs
[55:27] neither cast your poor before swine
[55:29] leave they trample them on the feet
[55:31] and they turn against you so you say
[55:33] have discernment
[55:34] and don't cast the person before shrine
[55:36] you have to have a desert as a swine and
[55:37] there's a dog
[55:38] and you wouldn't put what is precious to
[55:40] them or give the lord some praises
[55:43] do you understand what jesus is saying
[55:45] here oh glory to god your dessert will
[55:48] protect you i wouldn't waste your time
[55:50] with some people
[55:51] waste your time oh glory to god no
[55:53] caster pull
[55:54] before swine oh hallelujah praise be to
[55:58] jesus
[55:59] thank you lord jesus do you love him
[56:02] so discernment comes like a protection
[56:05] discernment oh praise god
[56:07] oh hallelujah give it the liberty praise
[56:10] god won't go into some stuff i could
[56:11] tell you some stuff
[56:12] but let it go a brother years ago but i
[56:15] just know i'm talking about
[56:17] he blamed me of a prophetic anointing
[56:18] upon him so when i came in the room
[56:21] and he talking and he talked in his
[56:22] channel and whatnot
[56:24] he said don't doubt me and he talking
[56:26] this with our next brother
[56:27] in doing so and when i reached that the
[56:29] lord spoke to my heart he said he have
[56:31] an old
[56:31] pentecostal prophet's prayers on him
[56:33] don't listen to him
[56:38] and i and he and he um
[56:41] i say you have all pentecostal prophet
[56:43] spirit and don't listen to him never
[56:44] listen to him
[56:45] today he's out there in the world normal
[56:47] but he calls so much a havoc
[56:49] with the spirit because people fear him
[56:50] because he said you have a gift to cast
[56:51] our devils and he have a gift that he
[56:52] deserves and never give to this and i
[56:54] watch them guys
[56:55] so you have to go by the discernment and
[56:57] god will prove it is right or wrong
[57:00] hallelujah are you with me oh praise and
[57:03] lord
[57:03] proverbs 14 says as corner secret wisdom
[57:07] and finds it not but knowledge is easy
[57:10] unto him that
[57:12] understand it go from the presence of a
[57:15] foolish man
[57:16] when thou perceive us not in him the
[57:19] lips of knowledge
[57:20] the wisdom of the prudent is to
[57:22] understand his way
[57:24] but the folly of fools is deceit let's
[57:26] look at the amplified than that
[57:28] a scoffer sees wisdom in vain for his
[57:30] very
[57:31] attitude blinds and deafens him to it
[57:34] but knowledge is easy to him who is
[57:36] teachable and understands
[57:38] go from the presence of a foolish and
[57:40] self-confident man for you will not find
[57:42] knowledge on his lips
[57:44] the wisdom godly wisdom which is
[57:46] comprehensive insight
[57:48] into the ways and purposes of god of the
[57:50] prudent
[57:51] is to understand his way but folly or
[57:54] self-confidence
[57:55] is fools is to deceive so our prayer
[57:58] should be psalm 119
[57:59] 125 i am thy servant give me
[58:02] understanding
[58:03] that i may know thy testimonies and the
[58:06] amplified said i am your servant
[58:08] give me understanding discernment and
[58:10] comprehension
[58:11] that i may know which is discern and be
[58:14] familiar with the character of your
[58:16] testimonies
[58:17] we need this element and i trust this
[58:19] give you a quick name
[58:20] an awakening to something called
[58:22] spiritual discernment
[58:23] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[58:26] hallelujah
[58:28] glory to god so let's go but the man i'm
[58:31] praying
[58:31] from this limit of spirit you saw
[58:33] heavenly father i want to express if i
[58:35] can this morning how in my heart
[58:36] i feel towards one the holiest of holy
[58:39] coming down to the earth
[58:40] and to redeem a sinner like myself and
[58:43] i'm sure that these ministers that are
[58:44] present now
[58:45] can feel the same way that it was by
[58:47] your grace that we have been made the
[58:49] ministers of this
[58:50] covenant thou has given with adam
[58:51] foreign and we are here this morning
[58:53] father
[58:54] gathered for no other purpose but to
[58:55] know and to study to know the will of
[58:58] god that we must do
[58:59] or make christ real to the people of
[59:02] this generation
[59:03] surely that in this day of judgment we
[59:06] will be brought face to face with this
[59:07] generation
[59:08] and being ministers we will be judges
[59:11] and the people to which we are spoken to
[59:13] and their attitude towards the word that
[59:16] we bring them will determine their
[59:18] eternal destination
[59:20] therefore lord in that day we would be a
[59:22] judge
[59:23] for or against the generation that we
[59:26] preach to
[59:26] father god please through jesus name let
[59:29] us not say one word
[59:30] that would be wrong but may we have
[59:32] sincere hearts and open minds
[59:34] that we might receive the things that's
[59:36] yours that we might be
[59:37] able to go out into our different fields
[59:40] of work after today
[59:41] and be better equipped because of our
[59:43] meeting with you this morning granted
[59:45] lord
[59:46] won't you come and be our speaker and
[59:48] our ears and our tongue and our thoughts
[59:50] let the meditation of my heart and
[59:52] thoughts of my mind
[59:53] all is your humble brown praying he's so
[59:56] clean and
[59:56] and clear he's praying he said we might
[59:59] leave here this morning
[1:00:00] so filled with the holy spirit that we
[1:00:02] will be no more determined than ever
[1:00:04] before to carry the message to the dying
[1:00:06] generation
[1:00:07] that we're living in lord we speak
[1:00:09] through us to thy word
[1:00:10] in jesus name so this year is the core
[1:00:12] on the main part of this
[1:00:14] menu here this morning that i want to
[1:00:16] get into i wonder today who is going to
[1:00:18] be the next president
[1:00:20] the election is coming up this is his
[1:00:22] time here and you know who is going to
[1:00:24] be president
[1:00:25] this next term what if i knew
[1:00:28] there's only one that does know and
[1:00:29] that's god what if god would reveal to
[1:00:32] me
[1:00:32] who is going to be the next president
[1:00:34] and i stood here in phoenix
[1:00:36] and made a prediction that such and such
[1:00:37] a man would be an expressed united
[1:00:39] states
[1:00:39] and they were placed in newspapers and
[1:00:41] so forth i would hit it right on the dot
[1:00:44] it would be perfect it will be all that
[1:00:46] i said would come to pass
[1:00:47] but what good would it do what good is
[1:00:51] it
[1:00:52] anyhow if i should do such a thing the
[1:00:54] papers would advertise it it would
[1:00:56] go out maybe and such a person would
[1:00:57] make such a prediction it would be true
[1:00:59] all newspapers magazines would pass it
[1:01:01] on but you know what that god doesn't do
[1:01:03] things like that
[1:01:05] god doesn't use his power and his gifts
[1:01:07] for foolishness
[1:01:11] [Applause]
[1:01:13] it's going to be whatever president it
[1:01:15] will be
[1:01:17] and to know which would be president
[1:01:19] wouldn't help us one penny
[1:01:21] that's why i say the devil in charge of
[1:01:23] democrats and seated and charged with
[1:01:24] republicans
[1:01:25] it wouldn't help us to for any or give
[1:01:28] the lord some praises
[1:01:30] so i am hooking up promising with no
[1:01:33] prophecy with trump and hooking the
[1:01:34] prophecy with nobody
[1:01:35] but no they might save god peoples all
[1:01:38] of them
[1:01:41] he wouldn't do us one better good to
[1:01:42] know who is going to be president so
[1:01:43] therefore god doesn't do things like
[1:01:44] that
[1:01:45] if i made such a prediction as that and
[1:01:48] it comes to pass
[1:01:50] and the newspapers packed it and the
[1:01:52] magazine then it would be
[1:01:53] to my glory people would say look what a
[1:01:56] great prophet brother branham is
[1:01:58] he told us long before it happened who
[1:02:00] would be president
[1:02:01] and what would be to my glory but god
[1:02:03] doesn't want that he's not interested in
[1:02:05] working things to my glory
[1:02:07] god is not interested in working things
[1:02:10] to my glory or any other man's glory
[1:02:13] he's interested to work things to his
[1:02:15] glory
[1:02:17] oh glory to god and that's why he said
[1:02:19] paul said do i speak with the tongues of
[1:02:21] men and angels
[1:02:22] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:02:25] if we speak with tongues and do not have
[1:02:27] interpreter what good does it do
[1:02:28] we need to glorify ourselves so whatever
[1:02:31] it is it wouldn't do a bit of good to
[1:02:32] tell
[1:02:32] it would be best for me just to keep
[1:02:34] still if i didn't know
[1:02:37] not to try to publish it because there
[1:02:38] would be no reason for me to do it cause
[1:02:41] it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't
[1:02:44] make much of a difference
[1:02:45] who is going to be president
[1:02:48] let's continue so there's a backdrop now
[1:02:50] so god when he uses his gifts
[1:02:52] he uses them for his own glory and for
[1:02:54] the glory of his people
[1:02:56] for the glory of his church for the
[1:02:58] defining of the body of christ for the
[1:03:00] glory of the kingdom of god
[1:03:01] that is why he gives these things in his
[1:03:03] church why he has teachers
[1:03:05] and prophets and evangelists and pastors
[1:03:07] they are for the edification of the
[1:03:09] church and for the glory of god
[1:03:11] the prophet is not to get out and mingle
[1:03:13] with the world try to take a gift like
[1:03:15] balaam did and make havoc
[1:03:16] or money out of it no i think it's a
[1:03:19] good thing for us as ministers to follow
[1:03:22] our order
[1:03:23] when we see such things in the world as
[1:03:25] we see today and we have an order from
[1:03:27] god
[1:03:28] is for discerning of spirits he called
[1:03:31] it
[1:03:31] try the spirits we read the scripture
[1:03:35] from first john 4 1 try
[1:03:37] the spirits isn't that right he says
[1:03:39] don't watch
[1:03:40] he says now and we have our order from
[1:03:42] god this on god now
[1:03:44] is for discerning of spirits try the
[1:03:46] spirit and i believe that
[1:03:48] a very good lesson for the church today
[1:03:50] is to try the spirit of
[1:03:52] anything
[1:03:55] of of
[1:03:58] anything have discernment of spirit i do
[1:04:01] not think that we should ever
[1:04:03] by any means ever try to judge a person
[1:04:06] by the denomination to belong to
[1:04:08] or by the group that they've assembled
[1:04:10] with whether they be methodist
[1:04:12] baptist presbyterian pentecostal or
[1:04:14] whatever they are
[1:04:16] we should never say never
[1:04:19] never judge a man by the denomination he
[1:04:22] belongs to
[1:04:23] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:04:26] he has
[1:04:28] oh give the lord a shout
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:31] always because inside here we have three
[1:04:34] kind of believers and more
[1:04:38] so you can't judge this church by one
[1:04:40] cuckoo
[1:04:43] one not case you can't judge it like
[1:04:45] that you have to judge people by their
[1:04:47] spirit
[1:04:49] or glory to god so you can understand
[1:04:52] why the prophet said
[1:04:53] are rather a man wrong in doctrine and
[1:04:56] right in his spirit
[1:04:57] than to be right and doctrine and wrong
[1:04:59] in spirit
[1:05:00] is your spirit
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:04] not your teaching not your daughter's
[1:05:06] spirit
[1:05:07] very important they wanted a rebuke but
[1:05:10] a man of her sister playing piano which
[1:05:12] is just
[1:05:12] a little short she said but you say but
[1:05:14] she have a fighting spirit you're going
[1:05:15] to have them with a long dress trainer
[1:05:17] right on the ground on this place
[1:05:18] the spirit terrible okay we give the
[1:05:20] lord a shout out
[1:05:22] so we have to whether he is lattering
[1:05:25] for marine
[1:05:26] inner altering knowing whatever it might
[1:05:28] be we should
[1:05:29] never judge him like that but by his
[1:05:31] spirit
[1:05:32] we are to discern spirits watch what the
[1:05:36] manner is mine
[1:05:37] what is he trying to achieve if the man
[1:05:40] here we go
[1:05:40] this is important you know all this is
[1:05:43] part of the warfare all this is part of
[1:05:44] the
[1:05:45] the the upon this rock i've built my all
[1:05:47] this is part of that
[1:05:49] okay so listen to this here we go all
[1:05:52] right
[1:05:54] you see now if i want to get this to the
[1:05:57] show this morning which is different
[1:05:58] denominations you are here
[1:05:59] you are still the church of the living
[1:06:00] god together and this is the thing i
[1:06:02] want to get to you
[1:06:03] that we are not really divided we are
[1:06:05] stones
[1:06:07] that are cut in different forms all to
[1:06:10] the glory
[1:06:11] of god you see so god shaped some people
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] i'm saying god use penny sometimes the
[1:06:16] car you say we are all like changed in
[1:06:19] godhead
[1:06:20] some are silver dollars some are pennies
[1:06:22] but god uses penny sometimes
[1:06:24] so you can't dismiss depending you can't
[1:06:26] miss dismiss which one
[1:06:27] because god used them god use them to
[1:06:29] baptize some some people win you to the
[1:06:31] lord and not even
[1:06:32] wrong why think about that
[1:06:35] somebody get you to the gospel and
[1:06:37] they're not even they're boxing and
[1:06:38] you're still
[1:06:39] wrong god use them to get to you
[1:06:42] you can't condemn them god made a way
[1:06:46] for you to get that breakthrough isn't
[1:06:48] that right
[1:06:49] so watch so there's so much in the day
[1:06:52] here we go
[1:06:52] that we live in pertinent gifts so many
[1:06:56] people judge people by gifts that they
[1:06:58] have well i believe these things are
[1:07:01] gifts i believe what we see take place
[1:07:03] is gifts and they're god-given gifts
[1:07:05] but if we do not use them in the right
[1:07:07] way
[1:07:08] that god intended them to be used then
[1:07:10] we do more harm
[1:07:11] with the gifts than we should if we did
[1:07:14] not have the gifts
[1:07:15] the other night i made a statement in
[1:07:16] the purpose saying i would rather see
[1:07:18] brotherly love existing among the church
[1:07:23] if we didn't have one case of divine
[1:07:26] healing
[1:07:27] or anything else
[1:07:32] and if you talk about brotherly kindness
[1:07:33] now they think of that light
[1:07:35] thing that vial sees trumpets woes woman
[1:07:37] in the sun
[1:07:38] this is rather have broadly love than
[1:07:42] praise god healing and i've broken here
[1:07:45] is another quote from the with our
[1:07:46] fellowship
[1:07:47] i would rather have a church listen just
[1:07:49] a moment i would rather have a church
[1:07:51] that knows nothing about any spiritual
[1:07:53] gift
[1:07:54] and just be so in love with each other
[1:07:56] and with christ
[1:07:57] i would rather have that than every
[1:08:00] spiritual gift
[1:08:02] operating in the church now that might
[1:08:04] sound high in a pentecostal group
[1:08:06] but i would rather have it where there
[1:08:08] is gifts they will feel
[1:08:09] where there is gifts there will bring
[1:08:11] confusion where there is gift they can
[1:08:13] be questioned
[1:08:13] but where there is love it is perfect
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:17] and if you have perfect love you will
[1:08:20] have perfect gifts
[1:08:22] so work with love first and hear the
[1:08:25] bomb
[1:08:26] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[1:08:28] bring gifts
[1:08:31] come on give the lord a shout oh glory
[1:08:34] to god
[1:08:36] i'll feel a fire on that one glory to
[1:08:39] god
[1:08:40] work with love first
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:08:45] so you see how the devil called people
[1:08:47] aside and had them in the corner by the
[1:08:49] self
[1:08:55] that is not different from the guy who
[1:08:56] called up any mountain thinking a lord
[1:08:57] coming
[1:09:00] jesus calling for him to go any mountain
[1:09:02] reasoning becoming a lord
[1:09:03] you see but love have to bring
[1:09:04] fellowship and love the commandment
[1:09:07] brethren first
[1:09:08] charity begins at home if you can't love
[1:09:11] who you see how you go love god who you
[1:09:13] can't see
[1:09:14] you don't have to love me love your
[1:09:16] brother love your sister
[1:09:18] jesus even tell him my all men shall
[1:09:21] know that you are my disciples
[1:09:23] when they could argue and fuss no when
[1:09:25] you have loved one for another
[1:09:27] love is not talk love is expressed love
[1:09:30] is something to feel
[1:09:32] love is something to experience glory to
[1:09:35] god
[1:09:36] hallelujah
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:39] how are you talking men have to talk
[1:09:41] bull language
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:46] that we are talking about language that
[1:09:47] by god have the prophet to forget his
[1:09:49] gun
[1:09:49] when he personally feels ridiculable you
[1:09:52] say if he had the gun
[1:09:54] shoot the bull peter but god wanted to
[1:09:57] speak the language of love
[1:09:59] and the only way we could do that to set
[1:10:00] it up that there is nothing to
[1:10:03] rest back on so he carries back on the
[1:10:05] gun he carries back on the human element
[1:10:07] he says something came over him
[1:10:10] something have to come over you
[1:10:12] it was the love of god glory to god the
[1:10:15] bull coming down for him
[1:10:17] and he could talk to the bull but
[1:10:19] understand the language
[1:10:21] it wasn't words it was the power or give
[1:10:23] the lord a shout
[1:10:25] it was more than talking to bull oh not
[1:10:28] just talking to the letter
[1:10:30] it was love spirit hey
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:40] now if a man comes and he has a great
[1:10:42] gift no matter if it belongs to our
[1:10:45] denomination or another denomination
[1:10:47] don't judge him by what denomination he
[1:10:48] comes from
[1:10:49] how he dresses what you want to see
[1:10:52] is what he's trying to do with that gift
[1:10:56] what purpose he has if
[1:10:59] he's trying to take his influence and
[1:11:02] build himself a great name out of it
[1:11:04] i'll have this element of spirit enough
[1:11:06] to know that's wrong
[1:11:08] amen no matter how great a teacher he is
[1:11:12] how powerful he is how intellectual he
[1:11:15] is how his gift operates if it
[1:11:18] isn't trying to achieve
[1:11:21] something for the benefit of the body of
[1:11:24] christ your own
[1:11:25] spiritual dissident will tell you that's
[1:11:26] wrong no matter how
[1:11:29] accurate how perfect
[1:11:32] how it is it is wrong if it is not
[1:11:35] used for the body of jesus christ
[1:11:38] to achieve something maybe he's got a
[1:11:41] great gift that he could draw people
[1:11:42] together
[1:11:43] with great intellectual or spiritual
[1:11:46] power
[1:11:46] that he could draw people together and
[1:11:48] maybe he's trying to take the gift and
[1:11:50] make himself famous
[1:11:51] so you have a big name so that other
[1:11:53] prejudice look up to him
[1:11:55] as some big person that's wrong that's
[1:11:57] why saying have no
[1:11:59] uh sub man some son of man and lois
[1:12:01] other man a new son of man
[1:12:03] and i explain a man god sent one prophet
[1:12:05] elijah
[1:12:06] to turn her hearts back to the faith of
[1:12:08] the father
[1:12:09] and until we get back to the faith of
[1:12:11] the fathers we have finished fulfilling
[1:12:13] the message yet
[1:12:14] he elijah gonna turn our hearts back to
[1:12:17] the faith of the fathers
[1:12:18] and the father fathers wasn't talk it
[1:12:20] was silver and gold
[1:12:21] have i none such as i have
[1:12:25] that was the fate of the fathers oh
[1:12:28] glory the faith of the fathers
[1:12:29] wrought i'm not a book of acts and no
[1:12:32] man was in charge of the book of ass
[1:12:34] could we give the lord a shout
[1:12:36] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:12:39] are you with me maybe he is trying to
[1:12:42] edify a certain thing
[1:12:44] and he wants everybody else to get out
[1:12:46] of the picture
[1:12:47] and let him and his group be the picture
[1:12:50] that is wrong
[1:12:51] regardless of how annoying anointing is
[1:12:53] or how revelation you would
[1:12:55] how much revelation you have how many
[1:12:57] mysteries you have if you're trying to
[1:12:58] shave
[1:12:59] you know so anytime i hear a man saying
[1:13:00] a group or what he have is the bride
[1:13:02] like trouble there's confusion
[1:13:05] because it's not working so no man can
[1:13:07] have the bride
[1:13:09] the bride is a mystery it's the mystical
[1:13:11] body of jesus christ
[1:13:13] you can't lock down the mystical body of
[1:13:15] jesus christ nobody could head the
[1:13:17] bright that is madness
[1:13:19] nobody can be in charge of the bride we
[1:13:20] have one head
[1:13:22] christ is that head and that head is
[1:13:24] hell of he
[1:13:25] coming down atop the pyramid give the
[1:13:27] lord our show
[1:13:29] glory to god glory hallelujah
[1:13:33] all right so here it is now watch
[1:13:37] now if he has a gift of god and he's
[1:13:40] trying to edify the body of christ then
[1:13:42] i don't care what it belongs to
[1:13:44] you are not discerning the man you are
[1:13:47] deserting the spirit
[1:13:49] the life that's in the man what god told
[1:13:52] us to do
[1:13:52] not one time was we ever commissioned to
[1:13:54] deserve the man's group
[1:13:56] but we was constrained and commanded by
[1:13:59] god to deserve the spirit in the man
[1:14:01] what he's trying to do what the spirit
[1:14:05] in his life is trying to lead him
[1:14:06] and then here we go if we find out he's
[1:14:09] trying to lead the people
[1:14:10] not to break them up but to bring them
[1:14:13] together
[1:14:14] and to bring to the church of the living
[1:14:16] god not all to one denomination
[1:14:18] but to an understanding one a fellowship
[1:14:22] to and a unity of spirit
[1:14:25] there will know what be one group
[1:14:26] internationally that will not exist
[1:14:29] oh glory to god but we get our
[1:14:31] fellowship we can come to unity the
[1:14:33] spirit
[1:14:34] we fight in the same devil we fight in
[1:14:36] the same war
[1:14:38] we're looking for the same promise what
[1:14:40] promised the promise of the father
[1:14:42] oh glory to god the promise of the holy
[1:14:44] ghost the promise of dynamics to the
[1:14:46] mechanics
[1:14:47] praise god i appreciate it all these
[1:14:48] years are still preaching it oh glory to
[1:14:50] god we're going to have it
[1:14:52] oh glory to god the sick will be healed
[1:14:54] there'll be one more ride
[1:14:55] nothing going to stop it a super church
[1:14:58] a super bright
[1:14:59] as we near the headstone oh give the
[1:15:02] lord some praises
[1:15:04] hallelujah so you're looking for this
[1:15:07] then if he is for marine
[1:15:09] lazarene whatever it is his spirit and
[1:15:12] his purpose is right
[1:15:13] and the spirit that's in him no matter
[1:15:16] what move he belongs to
[1:15:18] the spirit that's in him is trying to
[1:15:20] point the people to calvary
[1:15:22] away from himself away from anything
[1:15:25] else but his own achievement
[1:15:27] he has he's pointing the calvary he
[1:15:29] doesn't care whether he's even known or
[1:15:31] not
[1:15:31] he doesn't care whether even his own
[1:15:33] movement which is fine
[1:15:34] he doesn't care what is he trying to do
[1:15:37] the purpose of his heart
[1:15:39] what he's trying to get when you see
[1:15:41] what is the man life
[1:15:42] whether his motives his denomination is
[1:15:44] so his denomination
[1:15:45] when it's for himself whether it's for
[1:15:47] worldly fame whether it's a big name i
[1:15:49] predicted that come to pass you see
[1:15:51] that's wrong right
[1:15:52] there if he's trying to use what god
[1:15:53] gave him as a teacher or a prophet
[1:15:55] or a seer now the new testament prophet
[1:15:58] is the preacher we all know that
[1:15:59] he said every man ought to have a church
[1:16:01] home you ought to have a place not just
[1:16:03] a flute or wrong compel at the post
[1:16:05] have somewhere where you go to church
[1:16:06] where you call it your church
[1:16:08] somewhere you pay your tights somewhere
[1:16:09] where you help support the cause
[1:16:11] take your choice here we go here's the
[1:16:13] partner but then
[1:16:15] don't never disfellowship the other man
[1:16:18] because he doesn't belong with your
[1:16:19] group
[1:16:20] discern his spirit and see if he's got
[1:16:24] the same purpose
[1:16:25] in heart then you got fellowship one
[1:16:27] with another we are working for one
[1:16:29] great cause
[1:16:30] that's the cause of christ oh blessed be
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:34] name of the lord you love him second
[1:16:36] peter too
[1:16:37] it says but there were false prophets
[1:16:39] among the people even as there shall be
[1:16:41] false teachers among you
[1:16:43] who privily shall bring in damnable
[1:16:45] heresies even denying the lord that
[1:16:48] brought them and bring them upon
[1:16:49] themselves swift destruction and many
[1:16:51] shall follow their pernicious ways
[1:16:52] by reason of whom the way of truth shall
[1:16:55] be evil spoken of
[1:16:56] said amplified but in those days they
[1:16:59] arose false prophets among the people
[1:17:01] just as there will be false teachers
[1:17:03] among yourselves
[1:17:04] who will suckly and stealthily introduce
[1:17:07] heretical
[1:17:08] doctrines destructive heresies even
[1:17:10] denying
[1:17:11] and disowning the master who brought
[1:17:13] them and bringing upon themselves with
[1:17:14] destruction
[1:17:16] oh my so watch the scripture says
[1:17:19] if it's contrary but to my fate
[1:17:23] and yet the scripture says so the
[1:17:25] scripture is right
[1:17:27] and i am wrong the scripture is always
[1:17:31] right and the only way you can do
[1:17:33] anything is come back to the scripture
[1:17:35] you see people know what baram say but
[1:17:37] they don't know what the scriptures say
[1:17:38] but he came to reveal the scripture
[1:17:40] he came to brought the revealed word oh
[1:17:42] glory to god he couldn't bring nothing
[1:17:44] outside the word
[1:17:45] so when the angel came to him he had to
[1:17:46] check out what the angels say with the
[1:17:48] scripture could we give the lord a shout
[1:17:50] that's why paul said if an angel come
[1:17:52] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[1:17:54] paul is saying i come back and try to
[1:17:56] change the gospel
[1:17:58] let me be a chris oh glory to god the
[1:18:02] time chained where your first say
[1:18:04] because what you said is god oh
[1:18:05] hallelujah are you with me
[1:18:07] thank you lord jesus no watch
[1:18:11] now wait prove all things whole faster
[1:18:13] that which is good when anything is
[1:18:15] proven
[1:18:16] it will be even proven right or wrong
[1:18:18] there's no in between
[1:18:21] so when we say have this element and
[1:18:22] prove all things
[1:18:24] when is this proven is that that right
[1:18:25] or wrong have no in between half right
[1:18:27] half wrong it doesn't have that you know
[1:18:30] it has to be dusty at the lord it has to
[1:18:32] be god said so
[1:18:34] isn't that right all right so watch so
[1:18:36] when anything is proven the question we
[1:18:38] should prove it until you find out what
[1:18:40] is right
[1:18:41] and when you find out what is right hold
[1:18:43] fast and always grip it
[1:18:44] don't turn it loose no it is possible
[1:18:46] here we go
[1:18:48] that staunch christians fine people
[1:18:52] whole sometimes things that are wrong
[1:18:55] they hold to the wrong thing thinking it
[1:18:58] is right
[1:19:00] and then these things should be proven
[1:19:02] whether they are right or wrong
[1:19:04] and it is the duty of all of us as we're
[1:19:07] expecting to go to him
[1:19:08] when jesus comes and is the minister's
[1:19:10] duty when a question is brought up
[1:19:13] that he solves this out and then proves
[1:19:15] it before the people
[1:19:16] that they might understand because no
[1:19:18] one wants to be found
[1:19:19] holding the wrong thing now watch
[1:19:23] this is 20 years of no denomination
[1:19:25] their dying lamb
[1:19:27] may never do that if i go in this
[1:19:30] generation
[1:19:30] may the people who believe this message
[1:19:32] never stand still for the nomination
[1:19:35] you will die right in your truck
[1:19:38] remember
[1:19:39] the very hour that you mentioned
[1:19:40] denomination among you
[1:19:42] i don't care how sincere you are you
[1:19:44] take a man
[1:19:45] for your leader instead of the holy
[1:19:47] spirit to confirm this word
[1:19:49] that's the hour you die the genuine seed
[1:19:53] cannot
[1:19:53] because there is nothing left after the
[1:19:55] seed it's the same thing was back there
[1:19:57] in the beginning
[1:19:58] it's the bride that fell into the ground
[1:20:00] to bring forth the corner wheat again
[1:20:02] how many understand that the original
[1:20:04] church was the corner of the belonging
[1:20:05] to the ground
[1:20:06] how many understand the seven church
[1:20:07] ages was just processes to bring us back
[1:20:09] to the original seed
[1:20:11] how many understand alpha and omega is
[1:20:13] the same how many stand the same pride
[1:20:15] that was in the beginning
[1:20:16] could be the pride that he ended nothing
[1:20:19] less than that
[1:20:21] oh glory to god that's why the bible
[1:20:23] said when a church is believing the holy
[1:20:25] ghost is just as real
[1:20:27] because the same holy ghost that struck
[1:20:29] them on pentecost have to strike the
[1:20:30] bride in the last days
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:34] and all this press come down and united
[1:20:36] nations then waiting for rain too
[1:20:38] the whole world waiting for rain los
[1:20:40] angeles have to sink that breathing for
[1:20:42] rain too because it's a seed to spend
[1:20:44] all the more
[1:20:45] and we are waiting for rain too oh glory
[1:20:48] to god a perfect man's seed
[1:20:50] that was planted inside of you and i
[1:20:52] [Applause]
[1:20:58] oh my hallelujah
[1:21:01] glory ephesians 6 10 to 14 the amplified
[1:21:05] in conclusion
[1:21:06] be strong in the lord be empowered
[1:21:08] through your union with him
[1:21:10] draw strength from him and strength
[1:21:12] which is boneless might provide
[1:21:14] put on the whole armor the armor of a
[1:21:16] heavy armed shoulder
[1:21:18] which god supplies that you may be able
[1:21:20] to successfully
[1:21:21] to stand up against all the strategies
[1:21:24] and the deceits of the devil
[1:21:26] for we wrestle us against flesh and
[1:21:27] blood containing only with physical
[1:21:29] opponents
[1:21:29] but against despotism against powers
[1:21:32] against the master spirits who are the
[1:21:35] world rulers
[1:21:36] of this present darkness against the
[1:21:37] spiritual forces of wickedness
[1:21:39] in the heavenly supernatural sphere
[1:21:41] therefore put on the
[1:21:43] whole complete armor that you may be
[1:21:45] able to resist
[1:21:46] and stand your ground on the evil day of
[1:21:48] danger and having done all the stand

[1:21:51] stand therefore hold your ground having
[1:21:53] tightened the belt of truth
[1:21:55] around your loins have alone put on the
[1:21:56] breastplate of integrity the moral
[1:21:58] attitude and right standing with god oh

[1:22:44] jambis will
[1:22:45] withstand moses it's going to be a
[1:22:47] spiritual battle
[1:22:48] a conflict and there will be some just
[1:22:50] continue on
[1:22:51] the denominational church will just move
[1:22:52] right on into nomination and go on the
[1:22:54] way it goes but i
[1:22:55] mean the real true believer is coming to
[1:22:58] that battlefield and you
[1:22:59] better be versed and know what you're
[1:23:02] doing or you will take an evil spirit
[1:23:04] so easy and not know oh glory to god
[1:23:07] you're coming to what a battlefield
[1:23:09] not coming to a church bench not coming
[1:23:11] to this church not coming to a church

[1:23:16] we have hard times ahead last day was
[1:23:19] tough it have tougher times coming
[1:23:21] a pressure is coming cut shutting on the
[1:23:23] churches are coming
[1:23:24] it will take our power to be among the
[1:23:26] people oh glory to god but i'm
[1:23:28] not here to declare jesus christ god

[1:23:32] declare jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:23:34] today and forever oh hallelujah praise
[1:23:38] god amen
[1:23:39] may be seated satan knows
[1:23:42] that reasoning and where reasoning is to
[1:23:45] be an
[1:23:46] effectual witness of his resurrection
[1:23:49] this is good
[1:23:50] this is very good to be an effectual
[1:23:54] witness of his resurrection
[1:23:57] he knows satan it will take the holy
[1:23:59] ghost
[1:24:01] because man can't do these things so he
[1:24:04] equipped his army
[1:24:05] with the holy ghost to do those things
[1:24:08] to make known the secrets of the heart
[1:24:09] as he promised
[1:24:10] you can't do that with any kind of
[1:24:12] training you've got to do it by the
[1:24:14] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:24:17] the armor of god so the baptism is the
[1:24:20] armor
[1:24:21] so when he said put on the whole armor
[1:24:23] he's saying put on the baptism
[1:24:26] of the holy ghost and the baptism the
[1:24:28] holy ghost is from faith to charity
[1:24:31] oh give the lord a show
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:39] he said to he said this is the evening
[1:24:41] light to make hebrews to tonight a
[1:24:44] reality
[1:24:46] it would take more than a train you can
[1:24:48] read words
[1:24:49] and read words and read words it will
[1:24:52] never make it come to pass
[1:24:53] until you have the holy ghost here to
[1:24:56] manifest that oh
[1:24:58] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:25:01] until
[1:25:01] that church becomes both dynamics and
[1:25:04] mechanics
[1:25:05] the spirit of god that move him do the
[1:25:06] same thing he did if he hit on 16
[1:25:09] cylinders
[1:25:09] so will the bride so he said john 14 12
[1:25:12] the same works
[1:25:13] that i do shall do also i will give a
[1:25:16] charge of my dynamics
[1:25:17] in his mechanics and the world will not
[1:25:20] be able to withstand it
[1:25:22] the books and tips is one thing but this
[1:25:25] dynamics
[1:25:26] that come into charge of the bride the
[1:25:28] world

[1:30:59] church
[1:31:00] and defile it let's say the message not
[1:31:02] just church so in general
[1:31:04] antichrist spirit will come into the

[1:31:16] it he knows yeah what he knows
[1:31:19] if the people get a true revelation

[1:32:05] god's spirit
[1:32:06] discern and withstand
[1:32:09] if you don't have a discernment you
[1:32:12] can't get the design
[1:32:13] and withstand when you deserve the
[1:32:16] gossiper you know they're standing
[1:32:17] against that
[1:32:17] where you gonna read that why are you

[1:32:24] chat your discern
[1:32:26] and you withstand oh give the lord some
[1:32:29] praises
[1:32:30] glory to god discern and withstand the
[1:32:33] antichrist spirit
[1:32:34] satan will be powerless
[1:32:37] before them christ withstood his every
[1:32:40] power to give power over him in the
[1:32:41] desert yes
[1:32:42] i'm closing so we have reached the end
[1:32:45] whoo my my my mind
[1:32:49] you love him this morning but abram i'm
[1:32:52] closing with this iframe don't want to
[1:32:54] stay
[1:32:55] here manager gets over here you say my
[1:32:57] lord gave me a good corn field
[1:32:59] here comes over here wait a minute i'm
[1:33:01] supposed to raise oats but i'm going to
[1:33:02] get corn too
[1:33:03] you ain't got nothing to do with corn
[1:33:06] get
[1:33:07] oats oats is your power to raise you
[1:33:10] ain't supposed to hurt sheep when you're
[1:33:11] supposed to eat cackle
[1:33:13] god wants to place his church but every
[1:33:15] one of them wants to do the same thing
[1:33:17] he's only but but but is he go to nature
[1:33:19] he said the church is supposed to be
[1:33:21] predestinated on the adoption
[1:33:22] of children musicians can't please god
[1:33:25] can take a man
[1:33:26] here we go and adopt him into the family
[1:33:30] and give him something who did that
[1:33:33] god could take a man any man and adopt
[1:33:35] him and put him in family
[1:33:37] what do we do first he said
[1:33:40] first not second not third
[1:33:43] first try that
[1:33:46] you mean believers anybody supposed to
[1:33:49] try that
[1:33:50] yeah i might make a claim you can just
[1:33:52] say he claimed that that is so
[1:33:54] let me dig it up now let me drill it
[1:33:56] down there
[1:33:57] a man said angel talk to him i don't
[1:34:00] know where the angel come from
[1:34:01] is that vision below what happens the
[1:34:04] only way we could check out if it's from
[1:34:05] above is to check that through the
[1:34:06] scriptures
[1:34:07] because angel satan is disguised as an
[1:34:09] angel of light
[1:34:11] so we are one of i see a light if you
[1:34:13] see that light boy
[1:34:14] was so bright yeah what do you like to
[1:34:16] see what do you
[1:34:18] i don't want to hear what you see you
[1:34:19] know i want to hear what he talked
[1:34:21] because he mocked just give him away
[1:34:24] hell not he calls you
[1:34:26] he could disguise in a real nice way but
[1:34:28] what that angels say
[1:34:30] so when the child come out you could
[1:34:31] check the scriptures then you know if
[1:34:33] you would or not
[1:34:34] is that right so he said no if a man
[1:34:37] claims something
[1:34:38] try the spirit the man came and said
[1:34:41] something
[1:34:42] try it see if it is right
[1:34:45] if it is right move right with it then
[1:34:47] say lord send us something
[1:34:49] else keep moving just keep moving till
[1:34:52] every fellow take his place
[1:34:53] then you're going to see the church of
[1:34:55] god begin to get this place then is
[1:34:56] where the philistines will go to backing
[1:34:58] up
[1:34:58] the shorts will go down here will go
[1:35:00] down shorts will go off here will go
[1:35:02] down
[1:35:02] face will be washed singers will be
[1:35:04] missing that's right when the church
[1:35:06] begins to get in its mighty power
[1:35:08] that is when you see the holy church
[1:35:09] stand together positionally placed sons
[1:35:12] of god
[1:35:13] oh my adoption there's my spirit flowing
[1:35:16] freely
[1:35:16] i can work here get another one over
[1:35:18] here place him i can place him who's
[1:35:21] doing that
[1:35:21] god is doing that not the church doing
[1:35:23] that not the church vote doing that
[1:35:25] not the believers love the pastor and
[1:35:27] he's adopted not them doing that
[1:35:29] this is not for you to do this is father
[1:35:31] and son business
[1:35:32] oh glory to god are you with me this is

[1:35:56] that but i mean
[1:35:57] real manifestation of sons of god when
[1:36:00] god manifests himself
[1:36:02] he sends him out then he goes out
[1:36:04] musician could begin to play something
[1:36:07] what he does is the truth what he does
[1:36:10] he manifests christ how do you judge him
[1:36:13] how he judges man by the way
[1:36:17] he stays with the word
