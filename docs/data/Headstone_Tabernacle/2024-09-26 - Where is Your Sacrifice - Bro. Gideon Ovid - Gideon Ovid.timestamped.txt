[32:25] verses there
[32:33] Romans 12 just verse 1 and two and it
[32:36] says I beseech thee therefore Brethren
[32:40] by the mercies of God that he present
[32:43] your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[32:46] acceptable unto God which is your
[32:48] reasonable
[32:49] service and be not conformed to this

[34:16] blessing to your people in Jesus name we
[34:18] pray amen amen you may have your seats
[34:22] you love the Lord tonight my I believe
[34:24] we're in for a time I believe something
[34:27] good good is about to happen and
[34:29] something good is in stored I don't
[34:31] believe we gathered together in vain I
[34:33] believe he has something predestinated
[34:35] and specially in store for us tonight
[34:38] amen
[34:40] hallelujah after reading that
[34:44] scripture I just want to say God isn't
[34:46] asking too much of
[34:48] you he's asking for what's reasonable
[34:51] amen he has a special desire for you to
[34:54] to be blessed but he also desires a
[34:56] sacrifice amen he desires that you give
[34:59] certain things up he desires that you
[35:02] live a particular way he desires that
[35:04] you operate a particular way Amen in
[35:07] saying that I want to say in in the
[35:09] natural if if you want to lose weight
[35:12] they say you need diet and exercise
[35:14] sometimes you need to give up some of
[35:15] the things that seem cool some of the
[35:17] things that you might like some some of
[35:19] the things that that you find oh gosh I
[35:21] can't do without this but you need to
[35:23] cut those things out because you have a
[35:24] goal of losing weight likewise if if you
[35:27] want to learn to cook or learn a trade
[35:29] or some something new sometimes you have
[35:31] to put aside extra time to take a class
[35:34] or a course or or you know to get some
[35:37] level of schooling or tutorship or so
[35:39] but you may need to sacrifice time where
[35:41] you could have been doing other things
[35:43] in order to upskill or rescale or
[35:45] retrain yourself amen so the the same
[35:49] thing would apply if you have to pass an
[35:50] exam sometimes you have to take time
[35:53] when everybody else is playing to to
[35:55] review your work and to do it over and
[35:57] to to make sure quote unquote they burn
[35:59] the Midnight Oil to ensure that you are
[36:01] prepared amen so you me you may need to
[36:04] sacrifice in different ways and at the
[36:07] same time if you want to be filled with
[36:08] the Holy Ghost you need to to to make
[36:11] certain changes you make need to make
[36:13] certain decisions you need to make
[36:15] certain sacrifices right and you need to
[36:17] put those things in place because you
[36:19] have a goal and objective and ambition
[36:21] to achieve particular things now God has
[36:24] outlined certain sacrifices that he want
[36:27] of
[36:28] and in this scripture we read Paul said
[36:29] listen he beg you he beseech you he call
[36:34] you he say by the mercies of God he want
[36:36] you to present your bodies a Living
[36:39] Sacrifice so he say listen I want you to
[36:41] be holy acceptable unto God he said that
[36:44] is your reasonable service so that's the
[36:47] sacrifice we want to talk about tonight
[36:49] your reasonable service the sacrifice
[36:52] that God has called you tonight to make
[36:54] in order to achieve the blessings and
[36:56] the things that he have set out for you
[36:58] amen now if you ever ever study the
[37:02] subject of Economics there's a concept
[37:04] called opportunity cost and that concept
[37:08] basically says what you give up in order
[37:11] to gain something
[37:12] else right and when you evaluate that I
[37:17] went and I even checked the meaning of
[37:19] sacrifice itself that that almost almost
[37:22] encapsulate or is the epitome of
[37:24] sacrifice because it says sacrif rice
[37:28] refers to the act of giving up something
[37:32] which is valuable so you're not going to
[37:34] give up anything he don't want your
[37:37] spare change he don't want your your off
[37:39] time that that you're not really so so
[37:40] busy so you give him that time no he
[37:43] want the valuable something to be given
[37:46] up he wants you to give up something
[37:48] that may seem meaningful to you when
[37:51] everybody else is doing it but you can't
[37:53] and you choose not to because you give
[37:56] that up and it goes go on to say or
[37:58] Surrender an offering for a sake of
[38:01] something that's regarded as more
[38:04] important amen so that's what we want to
[38:07] look at tonight the fact that God has
[38:09] called us to sacrifice something in
[38:13] order to gain something else that's
[38:15] deemed to be more important amen the
[38:18] same way if you have to get the Holy
[38:20] Ghost that must be more important than
[38:23] Ling with your friends that must be more
[38:25] important than watching TV
[38:28] that must be more important than
[38:29] spending time on social media that must
[38:32] be more important than some of the
[38:34] things you you you believe to be
[38:36] interesting some of the things you
[38:37] believe to be important you must find
[38:41] these things of God are so important so
[38:43] valuable that you're willing to give up
[38:46] the things that seem valuable to you
[38:51] amen I I know last Sunday you heard
[38:53] about the value of your home and the
[38:55] fact that Satan wants to div value that
[38:58] he wants to devalue you he wants you to
[39:01] to to feel less than you actually are
[39:04] but God wants to see appreciation God
[39:07] wants to see the value increase God
[39:09] wants you to see you apply the promises
[39:11] that he left for you to your life that
[39:14] you could become perfect that's his
[39:16] objective that's his goal he want to
[39:19] look down and say Hey There is my spirit
[39:21] flowing freely he want to look and see
[39:23] hey that's my son there he want to boast
[39:26] about you he want to say look I
[39:28] duplicate myself there you know look
[39:30] they they're doing Greater Works they're
[39:32] doing more they have a kind of faith
[39:35] that we could only compare to to to
[39:37] those of old the kind of Faith they have
[39:39] now I haven't seen this kind of Fai for
[39:41] a long time amen that's what you want to
[39:44] see and I want to take us back to the
[39:47] Old Testament when we look way
[39:51] back at Canaan Abel and there we would
[39:55] have seen they were called upon had a
[39:57] desire to make a sacrifice unto God
[40:00] simple Sunday school style Cain and Abel
[40:03] two brothers at the time called to make
[40:05] a sacrifice and in Hebrews 11 verse 1-4
[40:10] it says now Faith is the substance of
[40:12] things hope for you know the scripture
[40:14] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[40:17] it the elders obtain a good report
[40:20] through faith we understand that the
[40:22] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[40:26] that things which are seen were not made
[40:28] of things which do appear and in verse
[40:30] four he said by faith Abel offered unto
[40:34] God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[40:38] by which he obtained witness that he was
[40:41] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[40:44] and by it he became dead he being dead
[40:48] yet speaketh so what we learn here is
[40:51] that there are sacrifices that could be
[40:54] made but there's also a more excellent
[40:56] sacrifice
[40:57] is the kind of sacrifice that God could
[40:59] look at and be pleased and say that is
[41:02] what I desire that is what I want once
[41:05] again it's not my opinion and my idea
[41:08] but what does God want for me what does
[41:11] God want from me you know just before I
[41:14] slip past and I almost forgot my title
[41:16] tonight is where is your
[41:18] sacrifice because a time comes when God
[41:21] calls you to make a sacrifice and he
[41:24] wants to see it and he asks you where
[41:26] where is it you had all the time to
[41:29] prepare you had all the time to work on
[41:31] it but I come to assess it now where is
[41:33] your sacrifice so that's the question
[41:35] tonight where is your sacrifice and
[41:39] speaking of of Cain and Abel there the
[41:42] prophet in a message end time the end
[41:45] time paragraph 40 he said I'll review a
[41:49] certain thing here I said last night if
[41:53] God only required religion if that's all
[41:56] he required then and Cain was justified
[41:58] so that's not it Cain Come Just As
[42:01] believing just the same as Abel believed
[42:04] Cain come with a sacrifice just the same
[42:07] as Abel came with a sacrifice but Cain's
[42:10] sacrifice was by works he raised his
[42:13] garden brought his fruits the best he
[42:15] could find by works but Abel was
[42:18] justified by faith he come with a lamb
[42:23] watch you'll see where fanaticism began
[42:26] you'll see where every one of these
[42:27] Cults begin you'll see where all this
[42:30] confusion begin and by God's help May
[42:32] the Holy Ghost place it in every heart
[42:35] here this afternoon I say tonight so
[42:37] deeply it'll never come out right so God
[42:40] is not in confusion he wants things very
[42:42] very clear and he's hopeful that by the
[42:45] end of this that you'll be so clear as
[42:47] to what is required of you you wouldn't
[42:49] wouldn't make a mistake you wouldn't be
[42:52] mixed up and confused as to what he
[42:54] requires down in paragraph 44 he says
[42:57] they were brothers in the same church so
[42:59] church is not it group is not it
[43:02] Association is not it it still comes
[43:04] back to an individual Revelation amen he
[43:08] said there were brothers in the same
[43:09] church amen oh I love the word look it
[43:13] sets life in you notice that's God's
[43:15] word now when Cain offered his sacrifice
[43:18] religious bowed down in worship and as
[43:21] far as fundamentally he was just as
[43:24] fundamental in his religion as Abel was
[43:27] so he had a form of godliness he did all
[43:31] the right things he knew the right
[43:33] things just like Abel if God talk about
[43:38] fundamentalism God requires worship can
[43:41] worshiped God requires sacrifice cane
[43:45] give a sacrifice but he did it in the
[43:48] wrong
[43:49] way we're going to start with this cause
[43:52] I see times moving quickly now let's
[43:55] start with these two Vines right here I
[43:57] can take anything that you wish to
[43:59] that's on Earth today and show you in
[44:02] Genesis and she's coming to the seed now
[44:05] that's why we got so much confusion so
[44:07] we don't want confusion tonight it's
[44:09] putting out otherwise see like a grain
[44:11] of wheat started with a grain but it
[44:13] ends up with many grains that's where
[44:16] all these isms come from all this
[44:18] nonsense come from where all this
[44:20] adultery come from where all this
[44:21] immorality come from it began in Genesis
[44:24] in the beginning skipping down to to
[44:27] paragraph 46 notice these two coming now
[44:30] out of Genesis let's bring them up there
[44:33] he was Cain as soon as he seen that God
[44:36] blessed Abel he became jealous is that
[44:39] right a religious worshipper becoming
[44:43] jealous imagine that now Cain died but
[44:47] not his
[44:48] Spirit then he come over and killed his
[44:51] brother is that right perfect type of
[44:53] Judas and Jesus again see let's bring
[44:56] them on further we could bring on Bring
[44:59] It On Through To The Ark all the way but
[45:02] I want to get something to you before
[45:04] it's time to get away notice let's bring
[45:07] them up on through the
[45:09] Bible watch in the days God called
[45:13] Israel out of Egypt perfect type of the
[45:15] church and when he already come out God
[45:18] that night give Israel a command by a
[45:20] lamb to make a sacrifice kept up 14 days
[45:24] must be found without blemish and was
[45:26] killed in the evening time all Israel
[45:29] laid their hands on him and then he was
[45:31] killed the blood was put on a little old
[45:33] doors and so forth and went it under the
[45:36] blood and stayed under blood once it
[45:38] stayed under the blood until the
[45:39] marching time come perfect type of
[45:42] Christ no one could find any fault in
[45:44] him pilate said Bring Me Some Water I'll
[45:48] wash my hands of him the Roman Centurion
[45:51] truly that's the Son of God speaking
[45:54] about about Jesus Judah said I betrayed
[45:58] innocent blood no one could find fault
[46:00] in him the perfect sacrifice he was the
[46:03] faultless Lamb of God that was tried
[46:05] before the wicked rulers of this world
[46:07] then in the evening all Israel give
[46:10] witness to his death let his blood be
[46:12] upon us and our children and he was
[46:14] killed there wasn't a bone broken in his
[46:17] body the sacrificial lamb of course
[46:19] perfect type so here it shows God is not
[46:23] just looking for a a sacrifice he's
[46:26] looking for perfection ction he's
[46:27] looking for a perfect sacrifice you know
[46:30] too many of us want to be blessed we
[46:32] want to see the rewards we want to see
[46:34] the results but we're not willing to let
[46:36] go and to sacrifice the way God wants us
[46:39] to we're not willing to trust him and
[46:41] take him at his word it's your
[46:44] reasonable service Paul said he said
[46:46] listen he want you give your body a
[46:48] living sacrifice for it's your
[46:50] reasonable service that's what's
[46:52] required of you when we look at Abraham
[46:58] in Genesis
[46:59] 22:9 he say they came to a place which
[47:03] God told them of now this is when God
[47:06] tempted a Abraham to sacrifice his son
[47:10] he said they came to a place where God
[47:13] told him of and Abraham built an altar
[47:16] so it wasn't just make a sacrifice
[47:19] before your sacrifice you need to build
[47:21] an altar you need to make an altar
[47:24] before you sacrifice amen you say there
[47:27] and laid the wood in order and bound
[47:29] Isaac his son and laid him on the altar
[47:32] upon the wood and Abraham stretched
[47:34] forth his hand and took the knife to
[47:36] slay his son and the angel of the Lord
[47:39] called unto him out of heavens and said
[47:41] Abraham Abraham he said here here am I
[47:45] in verse 12 and he said lay not thy hand
[47:49] upon the lad neither do thou anything
[47:52] upon him for now I know that thou feest
[47:55] God seeing thou had not withheld thy son
[47:58] thy only son from me and Abraham lifted
[48:01] up his eyes and looked and behold behind
[48:03] him a ram caught in the thicket by his
[48:05] horns and Abraham went and took the RAM
[48:09] and offered him for burnt offering in
[48:12] instead of his son and Abraham called
[48:15] the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as
[48:17] it said to this day in the Mount of the
[48:20] Lord it shall be
[48:22] seen in verse 15 and the angel of the
[48:25] Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven
[48:27] the second time and said by myself have
[48:30] I sworn said the Lord for because thou
[48:33] had done this thing and hath not
[48:35] withheld thy son thine only son that in
[48:39] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[48:41] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[48:44] the stars of heaven and as the sand
[48:46] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[48:49] shall possess the gates of the enemy so
[48:51] there we see it's not just about
[48:53] building an altar and making a sacrifice
[48:56] but that yielded instant results the
[49:00] angel said listen in blessing I Will
[49:02] Bless thee in multiplying I will
[49:05] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[49:07] heaven so it means your sacrifice has
[49:10] the power to impact your seed and your
[49:13] generations to come it's not just about
[49:16] you your sacrifice for your seed and
[49:19] your Generations as well it's that
[49:21] important it's important to them they
[49:24] don't even know it but it's important
[49:26] that you do it to ensure their success
[49:30] to ensure their blessing cuz it said in
[49:32] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[49:34] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[49:38] the stars of the heaven and as a sand
[49:40] upon which upon the seashore and thy
[49:44] seed shall possess the gates of the
[49:46] enemy so if you want your seed possess
[49:48] the gates of the enemy the sacrifice
[49:51] came first the altar came first those
[49:54] things had to be in position for God to
[49:57] be able to bless this way
[50:00] now in a message and thy seed shall
[50:03] possess the Gate of his enemy paragraph
[50:07] 55 it says now I want you to notice that
[50:10] this promise that God made Abraham
[50:13] wasn't only just to Abraham I want you
[50:14] to catch this now but it was to his seed
[50:17] after him now many people say oh if I
[50:22] had have to be like Abraham if I had
[50:24] been where God had talked to me and give
[50:26] me the Assurance like he did Abraham
[50:28] then I would have you know I would
[50:30] really have faith brother brandom if I
[50:33] just had if God had talk to me like he
[50:35] did Abraham but you listen you have the
[50:39] same promise that Abraham had that is if
[50:42] you are Seed of Abraham then you say but
[50:45] brother brandham I'm a gentile I could
[50:48] not have the Seed of Abraham listen the
[50:52] Seed of Abraham wasn't the natural seed
[50:55] this is for you now it was a spiritual
[50:57] seed for the circumcision of that was
[51:00] nothing the promise he even give him
[51:03] before circumcision but it was given to
[51:06] him before circumcision and it wasn't
[51:08] because he was circumcised and in the
[51:10] Covenant with God that way is because
[51:13] Abraham believed God and the scripture
[51:16] said that when we are dead in Christ we
[51:19] become Abraham's seed Paul speaks of it
[51:22] and that which is Jew is not Jew
[51:24] outwardly but Jew inwardly therefore if
[51:27] you are born of the spirit of God you
[51:29] are Abraham's seed and are HS with
[51:32] Abraham according to the promise see
[51:35] therefore every promise that God give
[51:38] Abraham is yours because spiritually you
[51:41] are Abraham's
[51:42] seed so God listen God love you so much
[51:47] that he gave the example of Abraham to
[51:50] show the connection between you and him
[51:53] to show that you are the Seed of Abraham
[51:55] so the same promises he made to Abraham
[51:58] are applicable to you today amen is he
[52:01] places such great value on your
[52:04] sacrifice you know we've gone through
[52:05] the story of Moses many many times and
[52:08] we talk about the burning bush and the
[52:10] attraction and and God hearing the cries
[52:12] of the people and come down but one of
[52:14] the things he often said he said listen
[52:17] I don't want you to go and take them out
[52:19] of Egypt and send them to the promised
[52:22] land because I want to do that he said
[52:24] but I want them to come there to make
[52:27] sacrifice unto
[52:28] me not just come because I want them to
[52:31] take a trip I want you to take a journey
[52:33] no no no no no I want you to move them
[52:36] for a reason they can't make sacrifice
[52:39] unto me in Egypt and need them in
[52:41] position and need the altar to be
[52:43] rebuilt for this sacrifice to be made in
[52:47] Exodus
[52:48] 3:14 it says and God said unto Moses I
[52:51] am that I am and we know it and he said
[52:54] that thus shalt thou say unto the
[52:56] children of Israel I am had sent me unto
[53:00] you and God said moreover unto Moses
[53:03] thus shal thou say unto the children of
[53:05] Israel the Lord of your fathers the god
[53:08] of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[53:12] Jacob had sent me unto you this is my
[53:15] name forever and this is my Memorial
[53:18] unto all generations go and gather the
[53:22] Elders of Israel together and say unto
[53:24] them the Lord God of your fathers the
[53:27] god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob
[53:29] appeared unto me saying I have surely
[53:32] visited you and seen that which is done
[53:35] unto you in Egypt and I have said I will
[53:38] bring you up out of the Affliction of
[53:41] Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
[53:43] and the Hittites and amorites and
[53:45] perizzites and hivites and jebusites
[53:47] unto the land flowing with milk and
[53:49] honey that's a Promised Land amen and
[53:52] they shall hearken to thy voice and thou
[53:54] shal Come Thou and the Elders of Israel
[53:57] unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say
[54:00] unto him the Lord God of the Hebrews had
[54:02] met with us and now let us go we beseech
[54:06] thee three days journey into the
[54:09] Wilderness that we may sacrifice to the
[54:11] Lord Our God that was the purpose that
[54:15] was the message let us go let's travel
[54:17] for three days that we may offer
[54:20] sacrifice unto God
[54:24] Amen now often
[54:28] times even though we are called to do
[54:30] these things there are voices competing
[54:34] interests distractions that may come
[54:37] along the way to shift us off course to
[54:40] get us away from the Target and just
[54:44] like that we
[54:45] found that same scenario took place and
[54:49] and brother brandham expressed it in in
[54:51] modern events and made clear by prophecy
[54:54] paragraph 109 he says now we find out
[54:58] bam of course he couldn't see he went
[55:00] out and looked upon the people and said
[55:03] now just a minute we are a great big
[55:06] people up here you're just a scattered
[55:08] Bunch you see and we all we all believe
[55:11] the same God sounds nice that's true
[55:16] they all believe the same God they all
[55:19] worship Jehovah look at balam's
[55:22] sacrifice seven altars God's perfect
[55:24] number the seven Church pies see seven
[55:27] Rams speaking of the coming of the Lord
[55:30] fundamentally he was just as fundamental
[55:33] as Moses was but you see there wasn't a
[55:36] Divine
[55:39] Vindication in there but they were both
[55:42] prophets but under Moses Ministry there
[55:46] was a supernatural Pillar of Fire a
[55:48] light that hung with a camp there was
[55:51] Divine Healing there was a shout of the
[55:53] king in the camp Great Signs Divine
[55:56] Healing and wonders and things performed
[55:59] among them it was a sign of a living God
[56:01] among his people fundamentally they were
[56:04] both right and balam tried to persuade
[56:07] the
[56:08] people he
[56:10] tried and bewitch them into it when just
[56:14] before they reach the promised land just
[56:18] when they are on the verge of the
[56:19] Breakthrough just when it seems like
[56:22] you're almost there he comes to distract
[56:25] you
[56:27] he say but now I'm afraid this is a hard
[56:31] day or two they'd be in the promised
[56:36] land you say but now I'm afraid this is
[56:38] a hard Mark to make some of these days
[56:41] I'll shut for it but remember this the
[56:44] churches are being Bewitched by this
[56:46] equal Council he's taking you right into
[56:49] it saying you're the same group you're
[56:52] not the same group come out from among
[56:55] that stuff and be separated certainly is
[56:59] it's true we to keep away from that
[57:01] stuff as far as you can from it bam said
[57:06] we're um let let your children marry
[57:08] together because after all we believe
[57:10] the same God how can two walk together
[57:14] because after all we Les they they be
[57:17] agreed how can you walk with God L
[57:20] you're agreed with his word how can you
[57:22] add Creeds and so forth to it when
[57:25] you're ordained not to do it or
[57:27] commanded not to do it you can't do it
[57:31] there's no way of doing it brother
[57:33] sister you can't mix the leaven with the
[57:35] unleavened oil and water will not mix
[57:38] Darkness and Light will not mix light so
[57:42] much powerful it's just put the darkness
[57:45] out and so we cannot mix it together
[57:48] neither can you mix sin and the world
[57:50] together you can't mix the church and
[57:52] denomination together you can't mix
[57:54] church and Creed together
[57:56] you can't mix the world and the gospel
[57:58] together it won't mix come out from
[58:01] among them be separated said God I'll
[58:04] receive you to myself you'll be my sons
[58:07] and daughters I'll be God to you we can
[58:10] never do it until these things are
[58:12] manifested and the word of God for the
[58:14] always proed to be the truth following
[58:17] the footsteps amen
[58:20] amen so it proves your
[58:23] faith when you could be obedient to to
[58:26] the word of God and make sacrifice as he
[58:29] desires as he requires and not be
[58:31] distracted by every win and Doctrine and
[58:34] every fancy word and every fancy tongue
[58:38] amen I want to quickly move to
[58:41] Elijah and in the book of First
[58:44] Kings chapter 18 it says and Elijah said
[58:48] unto all the people speaking of another
[58:50] sacrifice here and just to to to to
[58:53] paint a picture here we had 400
[58:56] so-called prophets spending some
[58:59] time trying to get God to come and
[59:03] consume their sacrifice trying to get
[59:05] God to approve what they had laid before
[59:08] him and Elijah came and in in verse 30
[59:11] it says Elijah said unto all the people
[59:14] he said everybody come come near unto me
[59:17] and all the people came near unto him
[59:20] and he repaired the altar here we see it
[59:22] again the first thing he did was rebuild
[59:24] the altar get it in the condition it was
[59:28] before before the unbelief before the
[59:31] distractions he had to rebuild it when
[59:33] he build it up and he repaired it this
[59:37] altar is the one that was broken down
[59:40] and in verse 31 and Elijah took 12
[59:43] Stones according to the number of the
[59:46] tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom
[59:48] the word of the Lord came saying Israel
[59:51] shall be thy name and with the stones he
[59:53] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[59:56] and he made a trench about the altar as
[59:58] great as would contain two measures of
[1:00:01] seed and he put wood in order and cut
[1:00:03] the bulock in pieces and laid him on the
[1:00:05] wood and said fill four barrels with
[1:00:08] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[1:00:11] and on the wood pour it all over and he
[1:00:13] said do it a second time just in case
[1:00:17] just to ensure that I don't take the
[1:00:19] praise that IID don't take the glory and
[1:00:21] we don't say you know it's a heat spell
[1:00:23] and perhaps at this this time this hour
[1:00:26] the sun is so hot it it might catch a
[1:00:28] fire no pour some more water make sure
[1:00:31] it have no chance of unbelief and doubt
[1:00:35] make sure we're very sure what is taking
[1:00:37] place here make sure nobody else could
[1:00:40] take the glory amen he said do it again
[1:00:43] do it a second time and they did it the
[1:00:46] second time and he said do it a third
[1:00:48] time and they did it a third time and
[1:00:52] the water ran round about the Altar and
[1:00:54] he filled the trench of Al with water
[1:00:57] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:00:59] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:01:01] Elijah the prophet came near and said
[1:01:04] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel
[1:01:08] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:01:10] God in Israel and I am thy servant and I
[1:01:14] have done the things at Thy word this is
[1:01:16] not a doing my own ideas and I doing my
[1:01:18] thoughts and I trying to follow follow
[1:01:21] what what brother so and so doing know
[1:01:22] because I like that program no no no he
[1:01:24] said listen I am following at your word
[1:01:27] at your word I will do as you require of
[1:01:30] me I will rebuild the Altar and offer a
[1:01:33] sacrifice the way you want
[1:01:35] it in verse 37 he said hear me oh Lord
[1:01:39] hear me that this people may know that
[1:01:42] thou art the Lord God and thou has
[1:01:45] turned their heart back again amen then
[1:01:48] the fire of the Lord fell and consumed a
[1:01:51] burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[1:01:54] stones and the dust and picked up the
[1:01:56] water that was in the trench and when
[1:01:59] all the people saw it they fell on their
[1:02:01] faces and they said the Lord he is the
[1:02:04] god the Lord he is the god that's what
[1:02:07] we need today brothers and
[1:02:09] sisters listen in a message God's
[1:02:11] provided way the prophet said paragraph
[1:02:14] 146 he said that's what we need that's
[1:02:16] what we need bring every believer
[1:02:18] together just like Elijah brought the
[1:02:20] people together he said bring every
[1:02:22] believer every believer together and
[1:02:24] preach the gospel
[1:02:26] don't hold anything back but preach a
[1:02:29] full gospel of Christ until the baptism
[1:02:32] of the Holy Ghost is poured up upon the
[1:02:34] whole church that's the only way to have
[1:02:37] a Revival so here you get the
[1:02:40] prescription if you want to Revival this
[1:02:42] is what you have to do get everybody
[1:02:44] together and preach in season out of
[1:02:47] season friend or no friend line upon
[1:02:51] line precept upon precept and you'll see
[1:02:53] the Revival come not by the minister but
[1:02:57] by the people getting together in one
[1:02:59] mind one Accord he said now get
[1:03:01] everything together get me a stone here
[1:03:04] to represent each one of them put his
[1:03:06] sacrifice upon it walked out there and
[1:03:08] he said now Lord let it be known that
[1:03:11] thou art a god of heaven and I am your
[1:03:13] prophet and the fire Begin to Fall
[1:03:17] brother when the Methodist can forget

[1:03:47] you're poured or what whe whether you do
[1:03:49] this and everybody get together forget
[1:03:51] all about all them little old things and

[1:04:47] out of your mind and let God word his
[1:04:50] word be the provided way that's the way
[1:04:52] we do it not a Methodist ritual not
[1:04:56] this and and that that ritual this
[1:04:58] theology or that theology let the Bible
[1:05:00] be right God said let my word be true

[1:05:12] Lutheran everybody else I'll pour my
[1:05:14] spirit upon All Flesh come out from
[1:05:16] among them my people that you not that
[1:05:19] be not partakers of their sin I will
[1:05:22] receive you amen that's the call of God
[1:05:25] tonight T yes sir you know at the end of
[1:05:28] the day this call to bring a sacrifice
[1:05:31] unto God is not just a command it's
[1:05:34] something that must be done out of love
[1:05:36] because you love God and you want to
[1:05:38] please him you sacrifice and you do it
[1:05:41] the way he wanted he desires that you
[1:05:43] present a perfect sacrifice because you
[1:05:46] love him that's what he wants from from
[1:05:48] you as we know Jesus is the ultimate
[1:05:51] sacrifice in John 3:16 it says for God
[1:05:55] so Lov the world that he gave his only
[1:05:57] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:06:00] him should not perish but have
[1:06:02] everlasting life amen amen and in the in
[1:06:05] a message of token paragraph 82 he says
[1:06:09] and now how could there be a more
[1:06:11] perfect sacrifice than God himself
[1:06:14] becoming the atonement himself when God
[1:06:17] was made flesh in his own creative blood
[1:06:21] that the only way that a life of God
[1:06:24] could ever come back because all of us
[1:06:26] were born by sex and therefore the life
[1:06:29] that's in there is of the world and that
[1:06:31] life will not stand amen it's the thing
[1:06:34] that's already judged and condemned you
[1:06:36] can't patch it up there's no way to
[1:06:39] patch it up there's no way to smooth it
[1:06:41] out there's no way to make it better
[1:06:44] it's got to die that's the only
[1:06:46] requirement there is it's got to die
[1:06:50] this old flesh man has got to die and
[1:06:53] the substitute a life of Jes Jesus
[1:06:55] Christ has to come into you which is the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost God's token that you have
[1:07:01] accepted the blood of his son Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ amen so many examples before us
[1:07:08] musician could get get ready we're just
[1:07:10] about winding down
[1:07:13] amen now in a message power of
[1:07:17] transformation that's what we need to be
[1:07:21] transformed amen paragraph 256 say is
[1:07:24] that right he said listen you can't
[1:07:26] cross that line he don't want you to
[1:07:28] cross that line he gives you an
[1:07:30] opportunity now to part yourself to him
[1:07:33] to surrender to him to be obedient to
[1:07:35] his word amen he say like the children
[1:07:38] of Israel did in their Journey coming
[1:07:40] through the Wilderness Israel did the
[1:07:42] same after they heard moses' message and
[1:07:45] seen it Vindicated listen to a false
[1:07:48] prophet that said oh now look children
[1:07:51] we were all the same and we went through
[1:07:53] just now we should marry one one among
[1:07:56] another and we should do this and that
[1:07:58] and and Moses told them differently just
[1:08:01] like the prophet today the prophet
[1:08:03] message is there as a as a really
[1:08:05] specific guide you have all the books
[1:08:08] and tapes and it's accessible but at
[1:08:11] times we choose to be distracted and
[1:08:13] inadvertently we are distracted but we
[1:08:16] have a call tonight to go back go back
[1:08:19] to his word back to the Bible back to
[1:08:22] the message back to the promises that
[1:08:24] are yours
[1:08:26] amen Moses told them different and seen
[1:08:29] God vindicate it because bam seemed to
[1:08:32] be a more instructive man than Moses was
[1:08:36] see he had come from a great nation
[1:08:38] where there was a great people and was
[1:08:40] all organized together the land of Moab
[1:08:43] great armies and great things that the
[1:08:46] people in them days would have fared and
[1:08:48] here come a prophet down a prophet
[1:08:50] anointed one false anointed one see come
[1:08:53] down to an anointed one look how close
[1:08:57] and taught the people and many of them
[1:09:00] went after that don't you never forget
[1:09:02] that see went after the thing that
[1:09:05] wasn't the word the Vindicated proven
[1:09:08] word don't let someone come in here and
[1:09:11] tell you something different watch what
[1:09:13] God is vindicating and proving now if
[1:09:17] them people look back and say Moses god
[1:09:19] appeared in the skies and a man spoke
[1:09:22] into existence fleas flies frogs took
[1:09:25] out of existence boils and diseases open
[1:09:27] up the Red Sea and we came and fed us
[1:09:30] Mana Out of Heaven oh that's our Prophet
[1:09:34] but here come another Prophet down glory
[1:09:36] to God I'm a prophet too say now you all
[1:09:40] I tell you no now you understand I use
[1:09:43] better grammar than Moses and am this
[1:09:46] way and that way see and so forth and
[1:09:49] the first thing you know they fell for
[1:09:51] it that's why we study the scripture
[1:09:54] that's why you study the message I will
[1:09:56] study the Bible so you can say just what
[1:09:59] the tapes say that you could hold on to
[1:10:02] every promise of God
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:06] Amen now you
[1:10:08] say I use better grammar than Moses I'm
[1:10:11] this way and that way and so forth and
[1:10:13] the first thing you know they fell for
[1:10:15] it and every one of them perished right
[1:10:17] in the wilderness not one of them lived
[1:10:21] they never did they won't be in heaven
[1:10:23] not one of them Jesus said they said our
[1:10:25] fathers eat Mana in the wilderness and
[1:10:28] he said
[1:10:29] see Pentecostal is
[1:10:35] right see they had really come through
[1:10:38] all the
[1:10:39] experiences see Pentecostal is right
[1:10:41] they come true all the experiences they
[1:10:43] are a f man in the wilderness he said
[1:10:45] and they are everyone dead death is
[1:10:48] eternal separation they'll never rise
[1:10:50] again although they had been through all
[1:10:53] these experiences with Moses
[1:10:55] figuratively speaking they had spoken in
[1:10:58] tongues danced in the spirit and
[1:11:00] everything but when it come to the
[1:11:02] showdown between the word and the two
[1:11:05] prophets between the two prophets one of
[1:11:07] them on the word and the other one off
[1:11:09] the word both of them Prophets You
[1:11:11] Understand
[1:11:12] amen one on the word the other one off
[1:11:15] the word both of them prophets proven to
[1:11:18] be prophets but one with the word see
[1:11:21] false anointed ones in the last days
[1:11:24] prophets both to them prophets one on
[1:11:27] the word Vindicated by the word and the
[1:11:30] other one not Vindicated by the word
[1:11:33] Cain and Abel
[1:11:35] again see two faults one false one true
[1:11:40] all right you see when God calls for
[1:11:44] your sacrifice I want you tonight to
[1:11:47] remember Romans 12 that scripture read
[1:11:50] where Paul said I beseech you therefore
[1:11:52] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:11:55] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:11:58] we've seen all the examples we've seen
[1:12:00] the byproduct of having your sacrifice
[1:12:03] the right way of rebuilding the altar of
[1:12:06] giving up and the blessing associated
[1:12:09] with that when you not be tossed to and
[1:12:11] through when you could believe and stand
[1:12:13] fixed and firm on the word of
[1:12:16] God he say holy acceptable unto God
[1:12:20] which is your reasonable service and in
[1:12:23] verse two said and be not conform to
[1:12:26] this world don't just try to be like you
[1:12:29] like like the world because somebody
[1:12:31] else being blessed because somebody else
[1:12:34] look and they sound a particular way no
[1:12:36] no no no no at the end of the day you
[1:12:39] have to stand by faith knowing that he's
[1:12:42] the same yesterday today and
[1:12:44] forever he said be ye transformed by the
[1:12:47] renewing of your mind that you may prove
