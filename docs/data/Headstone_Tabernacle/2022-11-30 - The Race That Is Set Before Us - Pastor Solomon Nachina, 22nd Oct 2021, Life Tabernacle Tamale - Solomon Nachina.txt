have been blessed right now father to your glory in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen you love him tonight praise God that is what we want Church to be praise God we come in the presence of God where he comes to manifest himself praise God amen so as we turn to the scriptures tonight shall we look at my Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 Isaiah chapter 40 and then First Corinthians chapter 9. praise God Hebrews 12 1-2 he said we're foreseen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the scene which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the Rays that is set before us looking unto Jesus The Altar and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and he set down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen praise God amen and then Isaiah chapter 40. verse 31 he said but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as they need as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint praise God hallelujah what a promise to those that are with Christ Jesus and our last reading tonight First Corinthians 9 24 to 27 he said no ye not that they which run in a race run all one receive it but one received the price so run that ye may obtain praise God and every man does Private for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible Usain Bolt is running and is the best runner about all the things he's obtaining are corruptable crowns but brother our race we obtain an Incorruptible crown I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection less that by any means when I have preached to others I'm I myself should be a Cast Away praise God may the Lord add a blessing to the love his word [Music] amen amen praise God our sound is just spray I don't know whether the air conditions are affecting the sound Hallelujah but uh can you hear me praise God will have it anyhow praise God so I want to take a title tonight from Hebrews 12 2 the race that is set before us that's my title praise God the race that is set before us and my subject is Find the meaning of life in the light of God's word Find the meaning of life in the light of God's word and for inspiration let us run with patience praise God hallelujah so tonight are you are you ready for a race are you ready to run are you ready to run the race praise God hallelujah you may be seated tonight amen now Paul is telling us that we are Compass about with so great a cloud of witnesses praise God hallelujah so many witnesses have gone before us because this race is a relay you are not running you are not the first to start that race and you will not be the last praise God until the trumpet sounds and we receive the crown we are going to keep running praise God hallelujah so the race is not it's not a Sprint it's a relay Hallelujah is started in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah and he's going to finish at the resurrection when that trumpet sounds in the Eastern sky that is when the race will finish praise God so until then we are running until then we are present and to them we are moving until then we are not giving up until then we are pressing the battle because we must run to win the race praise God hallelujah so Paul said in Corinthians 9 24 he said knowing not that they which run in a race run all praise God everybody is running praise God but in the mid at the end of that race is one that receives the price praise God hallelujah everything is running but the body of Christ We Are One body praise God oh so we are all running but the spirit is coming by one Spirit we are baptized into one body so at the end of the race is the body of Christ that wins the crown oh come into my rest it is not you nor your brother but it is the body of Christ it is all of us together but pies in the body oh come on now so I'm encouraging you come on we can make it come on we can make it come on we can make it Hallelujah we are here to encourage one another hold one another pull one another to the battle we are going to get to the Finish Line the devil can stop it there's a race that is set before us it is not by might it is not by power but it's by my spirit the spirit of God is here to give you power to overcome power to win that race oh blessed be the name of the Living God Hallelujah Oh Glory so Pastor only one guess the crown no it's not just one it's the body of Christ hallelujah oh Hallelujah and tonight God is rich in Mercy oh all those that he foreknew he predestinated and all those he predestinated he called all those who call he justified all those who Justified he has Sanctified all those who have sent over he has already already already already glorified [Applause] praise God so tonight we are set in the race I'm not running by myself

that I can be redeemed today oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah praise God so tonight the race that is set before us is a race of perfection it's a race of Dynamics it's a race of power praise God at the end he has promised Hallelujah I send the promise of the father before you but you've got to tarry in the city of Jerusalem and we are parrying here today in the word in his presence to receive the promise of the father nothing is going to stop it Oh Glory to God hallelujah I feel good tonight Glory Hallelujah oh we live in a deceitful age Hallelujah we live in such a time that everything is falling to the left and to the right but the believer we are looking to the coming of the Lord hallelujah there's no shaking our faith is not wavering but we are running that
