[1:05:19] first tree and 4
[1:05:29] reiden said mark chapter 7 read in verse
[1:05:34] 1 then came together unto him the
[1:05:37] Pharisees and the sitting of the scribes
[1:05:39] which had came from Jerusalem and when
[1:05:41] they saw some of these ciphers eat bread
[1:05:43] but defiled that is a satan with
[1:05:46] unwashen hands they found fault for the
[1:05:50] Pharisees and all the Jews except they
[1:05:52] wash the hands off to eat not hole in
[1:05:54] the tradition of the elders and when
[1:05:57] they come from the market except they
[1:05:59] wash they eat not and many other things
[1:06:01] there be which they had received a hole
[1:06:03] as the washing of cups and pots brazen
[1:06:07] vessels of tables then the Pharisees and
[1:06:10] described asked him why walk not by
[1:06:14] disciples according to the tradition of
[1:06:17] the elders but eat bread with unwashen
[1:06:20] hands he answered and said unto them
[1:06:22] well si had desires prophesy of you
[1:06:25] hypocrites as it is written this people
[1:06:28] honoureth me with their lips but their
[1:06:30] heart is far from me albeit in vain do
[1:06:34] they worship Me teaching for doctrines
[1:06:36] the commandments of men for laying aside
[1:06:40] the commandments of God you hold the
[1:06:42] tradition of men as the washing of pots
[1:06:45] and cups and many other such like things
[1:06:47] II do and he said unto them full well
[1:06:50] you reject the commandment of God that
[1:06:52] he may keep your own tradition for Moses
[1:06:55] said honor thy father and thy mother and
[1:06:57] who have acoustic father and mother let
[1:06:59] him die the dead but you see if a man
[1:07:01] shall see it is bad mother it is common
[1:07:04] that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou
[1:07:06] mightest be profited by he shall be free
[1:07:08] and you suffer him no more to do aught
[1:07:11] for his father or his mother making the
[1:07:13] Word of God of none effect through your
[1:07:15] tradition which you have delivered and
[1:07:18] many such like things do ye and when he
[1:07:21] had called all the people unto him he
[1:07:22] said unto them hearken unto me every one
[1:07:24] of you and understand there is nothing
[1:07:27] from without a man that entering into
[1:07:29] him can define him but the things which
[1:07:32] come out of him those are they that we
[1:07:35] fire the man
[1:07:36] if any man have ears to hear let him
[1:07:39] hear
[1:07:39] and when he had entered the house on the
[1:07:42] people he disciples asked him concerned
[1:07:44] a parable he said unto them ye saw
[1:07:47] without understanding also do you not
[1:07:50] perceive that whatsoever thing from
[1:07:52] without entering it into the man it
[1:07:54] cannot defile him because it entered not
[1:07:57] into his heart but into his belly and
[1:07:59] going out into the draught personal
[1:08:02] meats he said that which cometh out of
[1:08:04] the man that defileth the man forward in
[1:08:08] out of the heart of men proceed evil
[1:08:10] thoughts adulteries fornications murders
[1:08:13] thefts covetousness wickedness deceit
[1:08:17] lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy

[2:24:55] righteousness won't be accepted if you
[2:24:57] quit smoking
[2:24:58] well I better quit smoking because I
[2:25:00] profess Christianity Gordon I accept it
[2:25:02] you quit lust enough the woman just
[2:25:04] because you are making yourself do it
[2:25:06] God won't accept it if that's your works
[2:25:08] you have to accept Christ then something
[2:25:12] has to work in you to bring you out of
[2:25:15] what you in is not just you stop this
[2:25:17] and you stop this it's the operation of
[2:25:19] God Oh hallelujah
[2:25:22] Ephesians 4 something says this I say
[2:25:25] therefore brethren testify in the Lord
[2:25:26] that he answered walk not as other
[2:25:28] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[2:25:30] mind having the understanding darkened
[2:25:32] being alienated from the life of God to
[2:25:35] the ignorance that is in them because of
[2:25:37] the planets of the heart who being past
[2:25:39] feeling have given themselves over the
[2:25:41] last offences to work all uncleanness
[2:25:42] with greediness but he have not so
[2:25:44] learned Christ so if be you have heard
[2:25:47] him and I've been taught by him as the
[2:25:49] truth is in Jesus that you put off the
[2:25:51] former conversation the old man which is
[2:25:55] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[2:25:58] and that word conversation I want to get
[2:26:00] it in the amplifier you just ship
[2:26:02] yourselves of your form Anita put off
[2:26:06] and discard your all unrenewed self
[2:26:09] which characterized your previous manner
[2:26:13] of life and becomes corrupt to lust and
[2:26:17] desires that spring from delusion but be
[2:26:20] constantly renewed in the spirit of your
[2:26:22] mind having a fresh mental and spiritual
[2:26:25] attitude you have to do it
[2:26:28] Oh glory to God not just come to church
[2:26:31] but have an attitude or glory to God
[2:26:34] hallelujah
[2:26:36] therefore rejecting all falsity and
[2:26:38] being done with it
[2:26:40] let everyone express truth with his
[2:26:42] neighbor be zombiefied so we are part of
[2:26:44] one another members one of another when
[2:26:46] angry do not sin they will ever let a
[2:26:48] rat your fury lasts until the Sun Goes
[2:26:52] Down leave no room or foothold for the
[2:26:55] devil
[2:26:56] no opportunity for him let them that
[2:26:59] steal steal no more Marilla rather let
[2:27:01] him be industrious making an honest
[2:27:04] living with his own hands so that he may
[2:27:05] be able to give to those in need it's
[2:27:08] more blessed to give than to receive
[2:27:09] if you don't have the can't give if I

[2:31:35] is a work of God not a work of man so I
[2:31:38] am preaching to you but the Holy Spirit
[2:31:40] of the operate the word to you by giving
[2:31:42] you revelation and breaking upon your
[2:31:44] life you could do it you know or you

[2:31:48] you could do it when you get home you
[2:31:49] can do when your only way to the job but
[2:31:51] is the Holy Spirit upon your life
[2:31:57] business it has been the Holy Spirit at
[2:32:00] mini Ephesus church it was the Holy
[2:32:03] sprit uplifted the Smyrna church is the
[2:32:06] Holy to do all of that believe that
[2:32:13] there are no watch when in the
[2:32:16] individuals these virtues and things and
[2:32:17] knowledge that is added to faith then
[2:32:19] when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit
[2:32:23] cement step together
[2:32:24] there is the baton Holy Spirit that's
[2:32:26] why it's so short today from your faith
[2:32:29] up to the Holy Spirit seeing you in
[2:32:31] Christ then you become one and then that
[2:32:33] day you shall know I'm and the father
[2:32:35] the father me iron you you and me then
[2:32:37] that's a sealed unit of the Lord God no
[2:32:39] and then they are vindicated I'm pleased
[2:32:42] when that time comes takes place they
[2:32:46] become vindicated sons and vindicated
[2:32:48] taught us listen this watch the two
[2:32:51] spirits will be so close in the last
[2:32:52] days they'll be very see very elected
[2:32:55] the people can so live people can live
[2:32:57] clean listen holy life not be sinful
[2:33:00] adulterers drinkers liars gamblers they
[2:33:02] can live above that and still not with
[2:33:04] it this is the age of life personal life
[2:33:08] of Christ so I like how he's bringing it
[2:33:11] because it doesn't put no groans with a
[2:33:12] sit down and sit back and relax it
[2:33:14] doesn't have that it have a push in and
[2:33:16] oppression into this glorious kingdom of
[2:33:19] or believe that hallelujah
[2:33:22] no the second work of sanctification the
[2:33:25] word means the clean and set aside for
[2:33:27] service well notice when the unclean
[2:33:30] spirit gone from a man he walks in dry
[2:33:32] places and it's clean it's pure and
[2:33:35] everything else and then when that demon
[2:33:37] come back on City Hall scream it gonna
[2:33:39] get seven other devils worse than before
[2:33:42] this one to barge into the house and the
[2:33:45] man condition is worse than offense at
[2:33:49] first yet one demon no we have seven no
[2:33:55] works will never take the place of faith
[2:33:56] in God for our salvation works will show
[2:34:00] forth our faith already placed in him
[2:34:02] good works won't save you but they will
[2:34:05] come forth out of the sieve life as a
[2:34:08] fruit unto God I believe in good works
[2:34:10] even if the man is not saved he ought to
[2:34:12] do good works do the best he can what a
[2:34:14] harbor in the sight of God for man to do
[2:34:16] evil works and then see that they are
[2:34:18] doing the will of God nothing what the
[2:34:19] bishop and Pope's and high rocky of Rome
[2:34:21] were doing they were killing and maiming
[2:34:23] and doing all manner of evil in the name
