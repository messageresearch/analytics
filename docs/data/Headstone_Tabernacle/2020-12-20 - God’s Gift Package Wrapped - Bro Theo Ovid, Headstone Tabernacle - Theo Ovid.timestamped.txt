[35:44] 2
[35:45] 1-15 oh praise god i said
[35:48] enjoy i appreciate our christmas message
[35:51] this is my
[35:52] christmas message this morning to share
[35:54] something which you want to
[35:55] know will be a defined to you luke
[35:57] chapter two
[36:00] we want to read from verse one
[36:03] and it came to pass that they went out
[36:05] as decree of caesar augustus
[36:07] that all the world should be taxed and
[36:08] this toxin was first made
[36:10] when sarinius was governor of syria and
[36:12] all went to be taxed everyone into his
[36:14] own city
[36:16] joseph also went up from galilee out of
[36:17] the city of nazareth unto judea
[36:20] under the city of david which is called
[36:21] bethlehem because he was the house of
[36:23] the lineage of david
[36:25] to be taxed with mary his exposed wife
[36:27] being great with child and so it was
[36:30] that while they were there the days were
[36:32] accomplished
[36:33] that she should be delivered and she
[36:35] brought forth
[36:36] her firstborn son and wrapped him in
[36:39] smothering clothes and laid him
[36:41] in a manger because there was no room
[36:43] for them in the inn
[36:45] and they were in the same country
[36:46] shepherds abiding in the field
[36:48] keeping watch over their flock by night
[36:50] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[36:52] them
[36:53] the glory of the lord shone around them
[36:55] and they were so afraid and the angel
[36:57] said unto them
[36:58] fear not for behold i bring good tidings
[37:00] of great joy
[37:02] which shall be to all people for the you
[37:04] is born
[37:05] this day in the city of david a savior
[37:08] which is christ the lord and this shall
[37:10] be a sign
[37:11] unto you you shall find the beep wrapped
[37:13] in swaddling clothes
[37:14] lying in the mange and suddenly there
[37:17] were with the angel a multitude of the
[37:19] heavenly host
[37:20] praising god saying glory to god and the
[37:23] highest and an earth peace goodwill
[37:24] towards men
[37:25] and it came to pass as the angels were
[37:27] gone away from them
[37:29] into heaven the shepherds said one to
[37:31] another let us now go
[37:32] even to bethlehem and see these things
[37:35] which
[37:36] has come to pass which the lord had made
[37:38] known unto us you may be seated
[37:39] and we want to go straight to matthew
[37:41] chapter 2
[37:45] for a fuller context of this story and
[37:48] it applies to us today
[37:50] so we're not talking christmas just to
[37:52] christmas
[37:53] okay matthew chapter two verse one and
[37:56] now when jesus was born in bethlehem and
[37:57] judea
[37:58] in the days of herod the king behold
[38:00] they came wise men from the east
[38:02] to jerusalem saying where is he that is
[38:05] born king of the jews
[38:06] for we have seen a star in the east and
[38:09] we come to worship him and
[38:11] whenever the king heard these things he
[38:13] was troubled
[38:14] and all jerusalem with him so not only
[38:16] he was troubled jerusalem with him too
[38:18] and when he had gathered all the chief
[38:20] priests scribes of the people together
[38:22] he demanded of them where christ should
[38:24] be born
[38:25] so he heard someone like a believer
[38:27] right and they said unto him
[38:28] in bethlehem of judea for this is
[38:30] written by the prophet
[38:32] and though bethlehem in the land of
[38:33] judah at that the least among the
[38:35] princes of judah
[38:36] for out of thee shall come a governor
[38:39] that shall rule my people israel
[38:40] then herod when he had previously called
[38:43] the wise men inquired of them diligently
[38:45] what
[38:46] time the start appeared and he sent them
[38:49] to bethlehem and said go
[38:51] search diligently for the young child
[38:53] and when you have found him bring me
[38:54] word again that i may
[38:56] come and worship him also do we know
[38:59] that spirit behind that right
[39:00] and when they had heard the king they
[39:02] departed and low the star
[39:04] which they saw in the east went before
[39:06] them till it came and stood over
[39:07] where the young child was and when they
[39:10] saw the star
[39:11] they rejoiced with exceeded great joy
[39:13] and when they
[39:14] were coming to the house they saw the
[39:16] young child with mary's mother and fell
[39:18] down and
[39:19] worshipped him and when they had opened
[39:21] their treasures they presented unto him
[39:23] gifts gold
[39:24] frankincense and myrrh and being warned
[39:27] of god in a dream
[39:28] that they should not return to herod
[39:30] they departed
[39:31] into their own country another way and
[39:33] when they were departed behold the
[39:35] angels of the lord appeared to joseph in
[39:36] a dream saying arise
[39:38] take the young child and his mother and
[39:40] flee to egypt
[39:41] and beat out here until i bring the word
[39:43] for herod will seek the young child to
[39:45] destroy him
[39:46] and when he arose he took the young
[39:47] child and his mother by night
[39:49] departed to egypt and was
[39:52] dear until the death of herod
[39:55] that it might be fulfilled which was
[39:57] spoken by the lord by the prophet saying
[39:59] out of egypt
[40:00] have i called my son my god blesses
[40:02] would you love him this morning
[40:04] he's always a blessing and a privilege
[40:05] to be in the house of god and to serve
[40:07] him isn't that right
[40:08] oh blessed be the name of the lord thank
[40:11] you jesus
[40:12] hallelujah glory thank you lord give him
[40:15] some praises give him some worship
[40:17] oh glory hallelujah
[40:21] you know unwind nothing infinite dead
[40:23] church they know what that sill is
[40:25] no dead people we bury the dead let the
[40:27] dead bury the dead but we come here to
[40:30] amen to live jesus higher oh blessed be
[40:33] the name of the lord
[40:36] hallelujah glory thank you lord jesus oh
[40:40] glory
[40:41] so this morning i have a title god's
[40:43] gift package wrapped
[40:46] you know people like gifts and you when
[40:49] you get a gift
[40:50] people just choose something and say
[40:51] hold that no it normally is wrapped
[40:55] god gift package wrapped oh blessed be
[40:58] the name of the lord
[41:00] so uh the prophet is talking about
[41:02] christmas in our hearts we are so glad
[41:04] for this
[41:05] so happy to know that we are living on
[41:06] the nd when we see the signs coming
[41:08] again
[41:09] as it was and in that day of his
[41:12] approach
[41:12] and we humble our hearts and our
[41:14] presence let thy spirit read him
[41:16] supremely in our hearts
[41:17] and in our lives and you know when your
[41:20] joy is connected to something external
[41:23] you need something external to keep you
[41:25] happy and joyful
[41:26] but when you have joy on the inside
[41:29] there's nothing you don't need
[41:30] on the outside to give your joy on the
[41:31] inside they can put you anywhere anytime
[41:33] any place it's what's inside of you
[41:36] oh my that's when you know something
[41:37] beginning to work in your life
[41:40] when the external doesn't affect the
[41:42] internal
[41:43] amen praise god you have joy on the
[41:45] inside you could give it on the outside
[41:48] oh praise god you show it onto your side
[41:49] isn't that right oh praise the name of
[41:52] the lord
[41:53] so batman bethlehem prophet was a small
[41:57] tongue and there's a reason why
[41:58] god choose bethlehem because bethel
[42:00] bethlehem means house of god's bread
[42:02] and many people are guarded from all
[42:04] over galilee to come into the booth
[42:05] place where the bethlehem
[42:07] and trudeau province to be taxed of the
[42:09] roman government so number one god
[42:10] managed to make their move
[42:12] oh glory to god hallelujah the
[42:14] government had to issue the orders
[42:16] and it's not the government doing thing
[42:18] and doing that and doing that it's not
[42:19] that you know
[42:20] is god going and make a plan god has to
[42:22] get jesus in position to be born in the
[42:25] right place
[42:26] if jesus leave mary where she is the
[42:27] scripture will be broken
[42:29] and the scriptures cannot be broken and
[42:31] the only way to get joseph and mary in
[42:33] position
[42:34] is to extend the law to force them to
[42:37] come into position
[42:38] oh glory to god i would believe the lord
[42:41] shout
[42:42] so we're not here to fight the law he
[42:44] said national force
[42:45] will put to the the churches and the
[42:47] world cups the churches
[42:48] but the power of god will put the people
[42:50] in the pride so even if we dock national
[42:53] force we still need the power of god
[42:55] not some man of the or not some pastor
[42:57] man the power of god
[42:59] to put you in the pride you're not
[43:01] entitled to be in the bride
[43:03] you have to get the power to go in to be
[43:05] the bride oh give the lord a shout
[43:08] glory to god no entitlement god cut
[43:10] israel off because they believe they
[43:12] were entitled
[43:13] and god said not a bit of it we'll give
[43:14] the lord some praises
[43:16] hallelujah so they want to be taxed no
[43:19] matter what conditions
[43:20] they had to stroll along the road sick
[43:22] needy bedridden
[43:23] the leper the cancer the poor the lame
[43:27] the whole the blind all had to come
[43:30] because it was a government order
[43:34] and herod was behind it and it must be
[43:37] done
[43:38] oh glory to god isn't that right and
[43:40] we're in the east so a lot of things
[43:42] moving right now
[43:43] herod make his law joseph will marry
[43:45] trash and dunk to go into position
[43:47] and way in the east some wise men
[43:49] trusting away
[43:50] they on their way already took them a
[43:52] couple of years to reach but they
[43:53] underwear
[43:54] because they didn't meet that new baby
[43:56] the young and young child
[43:57] so all glory to god to their men packing
[44:00] up to to go to follow this star
[44:02] oh glory to god and planets line up and
[44:04] they're following it
[44:05] and when you follow that style it must
[44:07] lead you to where the messiah is at
[44:09] oh gloria and god had seven stars to
[44:11] seven ages
[44:12] and god put a malachi 4 stand any time
[44:14] you get it from that style you're in
[44:16] trouble
[44:17] any time a man can interpret what he
[44:18] starts saying that is trouble
[44:20] he said one star all glory to god to
[44:22] reflect the light of the uncommon sun
[44:25] and we only echoing what that sound
[44:27] speaks
[44:28] so the spirit the bride and the prophet
[44:30] say what the tapes say
[44:32] and what they say will already be said
[44:33] in the word oh glory to god so what
[44:36] you're getting this morning is direct
[44:37] prophecy
[44:39] oh hallelujah we're here to find it and
[44:41] tie it up
[44:42] that you can't miss it for nothing
[44:44] because jesus had messiah you're gonna
[44:46] have your messiah
[44:48] just as jesus says mary pack that gift
[44:50] you're going to pack that gift
[44:52] god will wrap it for you god will wrap
[44:55] you with it
[44:56] oh give the lord a shout glory to god
[45:01] hallelujah hallelujah praise god my god
[45:05] hallelujah

[45:50] package that was ever wrapped in all the
[45:51] world god wrapped it up
[45:53] god wrapped it up
[45:57] hallelujah and i want to break in on my
[45:59] thought and say the greatest thing that
[46:01] ever
[46:01] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it
[46:04] god
[46:05] himself wrapped his own self
[46:08] in a christmas package and sent it to
[46:11] the world
[46:13] oh glory to god did you hear that god
[46:16] himself
[46:17] wrapped himself in a christmas package
[46:21] and sent it to the world hallelujah
[46:25] hallelujah praise god why did they
[46:28] refuse it
[46:29] why couldn't they see it why didn't they
[46:31] turn off dinner down
[46:32] why is they didn't want it the same
[46:34] reason they don't want it tonight
[46:36] it wasn't handed to them in the custom
[46:38] that they were used of gifts being
[46:40] handed
[46:41] and that's the reason we checked it
[46:42] tonight is because it's not handed to
[46:44] the people
[46:45] in the custom they've been used to
[46:46] receiving gifts but god wrapped his own
[46:48] package
[46:49] he's got a right to do it he's the one
[46:51] that has given it
[46:52] he has a right to wrap it any way he
[46:54] wants to wrap it it doesn't make any
[46:56] difference how it is
[46:57] he's got a right to do it because he's
[47:00] the one that is giving it
[47:01] oh glory to god so nobody can tell you
[47:04] you can't make it
[47:05] don't let nobody write your picture for
[47:07] you or give the lord a shout in the
[47:10] house
[47:10] don't let nobody write your story you
[47:13] write your story yourself give the lord
[47:16] a shout
[47:17] [Music]
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:20] go read oh god amen let me send you a
[47:23] little bit is wanting for somebody to
[47:24] write your story you know is when you
[47:25] write and choose to write your picture
[47:27] you want to see
[47:29] but when them 10 spies come back you
[47:30] know what they say in our eyes
[47:33] we would like grasshoppers now when
[47:36] people talk and say you're small you're

[47:51] and so help me god you have to look at
[47:53] something different
[47:55] something bigger than you more powerful
[47:56] than you greater than you i'm convinced
[47:59] that god almighty is in the affairs of
[48:01] men
[48:03] when herod think you don't but taxes
[48:04] taxes taxes god's seeing everything

[48:24] and everything will come at an
[48:25] intersection
[48:26] where it all makes sense oh hallelujah
[48:30] sometimes
[48:30] it looks like this here not connected
[48:32] with this here

[59:01] baptize
[59:02] you with the holy ghost
[59:06] and with fire you see people cutting out
[59:09] the scriptures
[59:10] they could quote william branham from
[59:12] home no till never worry from naughty
[59:13] tribulation
[59:14] that is in the scriptures and the
[59:16] prophet came to read the scriptures
[59:18] whatever we have we have to go back in
[59:19] the scriptures it have to have a fire
[59:22] to power us out of here
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:28] courts can't do it tax can't do it
[59:32] nice bastard can't do that
[59:36] you and your pastor will go straight
[59:37] into tribulation and you can solve
[59:39] another contribution saying i'm not with
[59:41] that tenant
[59:44] i going up i want the oil
[59:47] because the oil has to get fired up yes
[59:50] yes yes yes yes you see you see when you
[59:52] have the oil
[59:53] water is depleting oil and set your hat
[59:54] on fire so then you burn in and you
[59:57] dip inside the oil that light can't come
[1:00:00] out
[1:00:00] because it's coming from the oil the oil
[1:00:03] coming up every service
[1:00:05] oil coming up or to leave here you have
[1:00:08] to go to fire you up
[1:00:10] light the match and put fire under there
[1:00:12] and say take that satan
[1:00:14] you're going to leave smoke in the
[1:00:15] devil's face oh will you have a good
[1:00:17] time this morning
[1:00:19] hallelujah my listen let's continue
[1:00:23] he wasn't wrapped in fine little in
[1:00:24] jesus this almighty god swap then cloth
[1:00:28] where they put the racks around the oak
[1:00:30] neck and keep it from rubbing blisters
[1:00:31] on his neck
[1:00:33] she has no diapers no pampers i forget
[1:00:36] what these what is it called a long time
[1:00:37] pampers and pampers on campus
[1:00:39] the soft things no diapers no armed
[1:00:42] them will take nice fluffy black blanket
[1:00:45] no swaddling clothes
[1:00:47] hallelujah and they could not receive it
[1:00:50] because they taught more of the crease
[1:00:52] than they did of the gift
[1:00:53] and that is the way today people can't
[1:00:55] accept divine speaking with tongues in
[1:00:56] their church they will ruin their creed
[1:00:58] the context of divine healing the
[1:01:00] baptism holy ghost such greater
[1:01:02] evangelical doctrines are possible
[1:01:03] truths
[1:01:04] because their creeds condemn it how
[1:01:06] foolish to take the paper the package is
[1:01:08] wrapped in
[1:01:09] and threw away the gift like the
[1:01:14] take your band and toward the gift and
[1:01:16] pull it up man because it's springy
[1:01:35] no wonder there was no room for many inn
[1:01:38] it wasn't wrap rights
[1:01:40] wasn't wrapping the classical people
[1:01:41] around it it was wrapped as a gift as a
[1:01:44] gift from god
[1:01:45] sent from god a god that they didn't
[1:01:47] know nothing about
[1:01:48] see that is the problem israel didn't
[1:01:51] know god
[1:01:52] a man named moses come and drop fleas
[1:01:54] and flies and frogs on pharaoh
[1:01:56] they saw miracles but they didn't know
[1:01:58] where it come from
[1:01:59] they saw miracles but they don't know
[1:02:01] who was behind the miracles
[1:02:02] who was behind that man called moses and
[1:02:05] moses god tell moses bring them to the
[1:02:07] mountain
[1:02:07] i like to teach them who i am that they
[1:02:09] can learn my ways and learn my laws
[1:02:11] you are born with this thing you will
[1:02:13] grow up in this thing
[1:02:15] you have to be taught baptized
[1:02:18] firebombed
[1:02:23] that were the only believers on fire
[1:02:24] fasting praying every week all kinds of
[1:02:26] that afterwards people have booked
[1:02:28] i remember the early days i couldn't
[1:02:29] wait to get the book
[1:02:31] you couldn't wait to get that tape a new
[1:02:32] book come out oh my god
[1:02:34] your whole life you're kissing that you
[1:02:36] can't finish read the book
[1:02:37] know everything there and people just
[1:02:39] you know this day any message
[1:02:44] no room in our religious circles for
[1:02:47] holy ghost meeting
[1:02:48] when last year message because holy
[1:02:50] ghost meeting
[1:02:52] that's the quotient that's the quotient
[1:02:55] holy ghost meeting
[1:02:56] no man raring for us because you have a
[1:02:59] mouth i'm not talking about that
[1:03:02] i'm talking about holy ghost meeting
[1:03:05] when people come and cry at the altar
[1:03:06] tell me lord
[1:03:07] see me lord baptize me lord
[1:03:11] change me lord
[1:03:16] jacob money couldn't change him
[1:03:19] he was very wealthy after ripping off
[1:03:21] everybody had everybody
[1:03:23] could rip off his report
[1:03:24] he's a ripoff artist and yet god says
[1:03:27] jacob i love
[1:03:30] because jacob god knew what was inside
[1:03:32] that man when he showed uncommon jacob
[1:03:34] say with him and my brother you could
[1:03:35] kill me but you're richer than me and
[1:03:36] you had to change it
[1:03:38] god catch jacob alone and that's the
[1:03:41] problem with some of you can't get
[1:03:42] caught alone yet
[1:03:44] they're still talking friends and family
[1:03:45] and this one and down where i talk to
[1:03:47] this one
[1:03:47] go there catch you by yourself here
[1:03:49] where you could deal with you
[1:03:52] when you could see you and ask yourself
[1:03:55] if you want to continue as you are
[1:03:56] because some people
[1:03:57] like how they are they have religious
[1:03:59] spirits upon them
[1:04:00] they in church they need message but
[1:04:02] it's religious spirits upon them it's
[1:04:04] demons
[1:04:06] make them feel they're okay
[1:04:10] jacobs had a wrestling touch angel hold
[1:04:12] on angel that didn't change anymore
[1:04:14] is when the angels had a we would go
[1:04:16] want to go he said
[1:04:17] not letting you go try to change me you
[1:04:19] know all this wrestling holding i was
[1:04:21] representing the angel that is nothing
[1:04:22] you know
[1:04:23] another man went to all kind of
[1:04:25] presently come back and see him all
[1:04:26] foolish we're not counting like that you
[1:04:27] know
[1:04:29] so it's not a matter
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:33] yeah all that is good
[1:04:36] but after that you're better than you
[1:04:39] walk
[1:04:40] you're better when you talk
[1:04:41] [Applause]
[1:04:45] when jacob's had to lock that angel leg
[1:04:47] and foot and hand
[1:04:48] he's had to go he said you can't go
[1:04:50] until they change me
[1:04:52] then the angel pulling away he said
[1:04:53] you're not going serious
[1:04:55] you see what is test shield to see if
[1:04:57] you really mean business
[1:04:59] guess what when the angel touch him so
[1:05:01] he everybody can see some men
[1:05:02] oh god how are you looking silver
[1:05:06] looking
[1:05:17] but name change broken
[1:05:21] but inside change he can face anything
[1:05:25] but he walking broken people can laugh
[1:05:28] at him
[1:05:29] he's okay keep on laughing people can
[1:05:31] mock him
[1:05:33] oh glory to god doesn't matter who hate
[1:05:34] him
[1:05:36] hallelujah you're free on the inside
[1:05:40] a transform walk a transformed talk a
[1:05:43] transformed life
[1:05:46] oh glory to god amen
[1:05:50] jacob was six after that why
[1:05:53] he wrestled all night with the angel
[1:05:56] no preachers put something in his head
[1:05:59] oh hallelujah
[1:06:00] there's no room for holy ghost meeting
[1:06:02] they don't want it it belittles them in
[1:06:04] the sight of the classes of the country
[1:06:06] it belittles them to think here we go
[1:06:08] that they have to humble themselves
[1:06:10] to come down to the altar and cry and to
[1:06:13] tarry dear until they are filled with
[1:06:16] power from on high to rise up with the
[1:06:19] newness of life
[1:06:20] to let their hair grow out
[1:06:24] to act like a woman ought to mend
[1:06:26] through the cigarettes away and so on
[1:06:28] instead of receiving god's gift god's
[1:06:30] christmas gift
[1:06:31] they say i'd rather have a creed than
[1:06:33] with the gift they'd rather have the
[1:06:34] paper than the gift
[1:06:36] he was wrapped in a dirty cloth a
[1:06:38] swaddling cloth
[1:06:40] and he was wrapped today here we go he's
[1:06:42] wrapped today in the same thing
[1:06:43] which they call holy ruler fanaticism
[1:06:47] a bunch of heretics it is wrapped up in
[1:06:49] swaddling clothes
[1:06:51] that's why how could they handle that
[1:06:53] peter numbers ignorant and on a limb
[1:06:55] and them staggering in the upper room so
[1:06:57] like that like junkman if peter come
[1:06:59] back drunk man they go on who's he you
[1:07:00] know
[1:07:01] in this message they put this sat down
[1:07:06] pillow fire knocked down moses you know
[1:07:09] hit moses and gave moses revelation of
[1:07:10] genesis
[1:07:12] same pillar fire came down over israel
[1:07:14] same pillar fire knocked down paul
[1:07:16] they're giving revolution in the new
[1:07:17] testament same pillar fire to hit
[1:07:19] william branham
[1:07:21] trivial every mystery and we are called
[1:07:23] into that same pillar of fire
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:25] not a man you know that's the pillar of
[1:07:27] fire are we talking about
[1:07:29] there's a high calling oh glory to god
[1:07:31] christmas present is because they know
[1:07:33] what what they said watch he said they
[1:07:35] don't want it it will make woman act
[1:07:36] different

[1:07:45] you'll have to clean up your life you'll

[1:07:53] although they may know it's right they
[1:07:55] don't want it it brings too much truth
[1:07:57] to them
[1:07:58] it uncovers their sin it's going to cost
[1:08:02] you
[1:08:04] you're going to cost people anything
[1:08:05] they don't want nothing to do with
[1:08:07] that's the way it is today
[1:08:08] they're going to cost you your bunker
[1:08:09] parties big times cigars duty jokes all
[1:08:11] the feel things of the world
[1:08:13] but i'll give you a name written in the
[1:08:14] lamb book of life
[1:08:16] that faded not away when they refused
[1:08:19] the holy ghost here we go
[1:08:21] when he refused the holy ghost they
[1:08:23] refuse christ
[1:08:24] they refuse god's program they refuse
[1:08:27] the messenger
[1:08:30] when they see the holy ghost they refuse
[1:08:31] the messenger watch they refuse
[1:08:33] everything so therefore they have they
[1:08:35] are left in their sins
[1:08:37] there is nothing left but judgment he
[1:08:39] said
[1:08:40] they have refused christ they refuse
[1:08:41] this program they refuse a spirit he
[1:08:44] tried for 50 years
[1:08:45] and that's the holy ghost to fall in
[1:08:46] america and they refuse it for 50 years
[1:08:49] another particular thing i think one of
[1:08:50] the most pathetic words that jesus ever
[1:08:52] said
[1:08:52] he said father i sanctify myself that
[1:08:55] they might be sanctified in other words
[1:08:57] he had a right as a man
[1:08:58] you had a right to a home you're the
[1:09:00] writer of family you as a man as much
[1:09:02] man as you are or i
[1:09:03] am as much human and as mannered as we
[1:09:05] are he had a right to it
[1:09:07] but he had trained 12 men that was going
[1:09:09] to take the gospel to all the world
[1:09:11] so he sanctify himself watch i signify
[1:09:15] myself for their sake
[1:09:16] he say a gift of god keeping himself
[1:09:19] sanctified then cry out all gifts of god
[1:09:23] you people who claim that you receive
[1:09:25] his spirit
[1:09:26] keep yourself sanctified keep
[1:09:29] away from the things of the world be
[1:09:32] sanctified
[1:09:33] oh my the love of god how god unfolded
[1:09:36] himself
[1:09:37] and come in a christmas package was laid
[1:09:39] on straw
[1:09:40] the first thing oh my he was later in
[1:09:43] straw the last thing he was a torn crown
[1:09:45] on a with a dirty rag wrap over his eyes
[1:09:48] hit on the head saying
[1:09:49] if you're a prophet tell us who hit you
[1:09:51] and he was attacked to the cross
[1:09:52] love reaching out when his own children
[1:09:54] is crying for his blood
[1:09:56] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:09:58] what they're doing the church don't want
[1:10:00] it they want a creed
[1:10:01] we need love the church is dying by
[1:10:03] creeds
[1:10:05] glory to god here brother kangaroo the
[1:10:06] church is dying by creeds
[1:10:08] if it can only live by love and
[1:10:11] and yet people want to force you to
[1:10:13] believe what they believe
[1:10:15] doctrine could never bring love it takes
[1:10:18] the holy ghost to bring love
[1:10:20] [Applause]

[1:26:36] i wanted a night if you would like to
[1:26:37] look on the inside of that package
[1:26:40] and see if there's somebody in here who
[1:26:43] loves you
[1:26:43] somebody who died for you somebody who
[1:26:45] gave their life for you
[1:26:47] who would you willing tonight to take a
[1:26:48] sweating cloth off of him
[1:26:50] that dirty clothe that call him fanatic
[1:26:53] and holy rule and wrap yourself in it
[1:26:55] and take the way with the lord and this
[1:26:57] fight
[1:26:59] you say what does that have to do with
[1:27:00] us this christmas story i'm almost
[1:27:02] finished here now
[1:27:04] listen to this here now this one with
[1:27:06] cena stand in the east and come to
[1:27:08] worship him
[1:27:09] when christ jesus was being formed in
[1:27:13] mary
[1:27:15] that is when the persecution set in
[1:27:23] uh-huh so now we can tie it to us here
[1:27:25] now
[1:27:26] all right and it's the same thing in you
[1:27:29] galatians 4 19 says when christ
[1:27:32] the hope of glory is being formed in you
[1:27:35] christ is being formed in you
[1:27:36] when you are dying and christ is coming
[1:27:40] to life
[1:27:42] watch the persecution second trouble is
[1:27:45] that on every hand
[1:27:47] watch the devil go in a rampage
[1:27:49] certainly
[1:27:50] when christ is being formed in you
[1:27:55] so no minutes that could fool us no man
[1:27:57] can't fool us
[1:27:58] we under no persecution we are not
[1:28:00] pressure we are not timer lingering to
[1:28:02] get
[1:28:03] right with god die out and let christ
[1:28:06] start to form in you
[1:28:08] then watch the laws begin to move in
[1:28:10] watch everything begin to change
[1:28:13] let's continue and when christ
[1:28:16] was being formed in mary quickly come
[1:28:18] the king's commandment
[1:28:20] all you people she said the christ was
[1:28:22] becoming a full baby
[1:28:24] ready to be delivered right then the
[1:28:27] great persecution
[1:28:29] here come the prophecy now now the baby
[1:28:31] had been formed for a long time
[1:28:33] in the womb but this has come in the
[1:28:35] last days
[1:28:36] when the completeness when the fullness
[1:28:39] of the godhead
[1:28:40] when the fullness of christ is to be
[1:28:44] manifested among his people
[1:28:47] that's the reason our great social lives
[1:28:50] and things can understand that
[1:28:51] it is foolishness to them now watch
[1:28:55] they are forming the congress of
[1:28:56] churches just the time
[1:28:58] when the church is beginning to get to
[1:29:00] his feet
[1:29:01] where the supernatural is beginning to
[1:29:04] work
[1:29:06] now they're going to try to stop stop
[1:29:08] this stuff
[1:29:09] remember one summer telling you the
[1:29:11] government got closer it's done for
[1:29:12] having books and tape and preaching the
[1:29:13] message that's foolishness
[1:29:15] that makes no sense you're not enough
[1:29:16] man people are wrong with all kind of
[1:29:17] crazy stuff
[1:29:21] the only time you press came down is
[1:29:22] that when they're stuck in the upper
[1:29:23] room
[1:29:24] bomb said the devil said leave them
[1:29:26] they're only having a great time
[1:29:28] you know when the press comes on them
[1:29:29] when peter says silver and gold
[1:29:31] have i none such as i have and that was
[1:29:35] peter said
[1:29:35] only kill jesus but the package that
[1:29:38] jesus had
[1:29:39] he gave me and i received that christmas
[1:29:42] gift
[1:29:43] and now he is in me and what i have in
[1:29:46] me i could give you
[1:29:47] so i'd have to actually want it i could
[1:29:50] give it
[1:29:51] because i have it i can't give what i
[1:29:54] don't have
[1:29:55] such as i have i give rise up and walk
[1:29:57] in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:09] wait wait till that didn't happen this
[1:30:11] message
[1:30:13] you can see who's your friend
[1:30:17] when that to jump and leap and wait and
[1:30:20] carry on
[1:30:21] mom said the devil get up and said we
[1:30:22] had to stop this you know yeah so the
[1:30:24] devil jumped on them pharisees and
[1:30:25] scribe
[1:30:26] and said put some legs on them and then
[1:30:27] stop that because they think likes could
[1:30:29] stop them
[1:30:30] they take licks could beat all the holy
[1:30:31] ghosts they think the legs go stop the
[1:30:33] anointing
[1:30:34] they take blows and pressure when them
[1:30:36] fellas went back into the prayer meeting
[1:30:37] they are missing this after that you
[1:30:39] know
[1:30:39] they say lord god send the power one
[1:30:41] more time give us strength that we could
[1:30:43] go back out and testify
[1:30:45] and the bible said they were refilled
[1:30:47] with the holy ghost refilled
[1:30:49] refilled yes yes you heard me he said
[1:30:51] the dynamics of this church
[1:30:53] will be a refilling
[1:30:56] of the holy ghost no press can't come no
[1:30:59] no
[1:31:01] nobody can close the church are they
[1:31:02] gonna do that with no power
[1:31:04] we goose
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:09] if they close that we go scoop not even
[1:31:12] coroner my rescue closes down
[1:31:15] the church open right through
[1:31:18] who is the church upon this rock come on
[1:31:21] now i'll build my church
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:26] it's the rock inside of you come on can
[1:31:29] preach back to me somebody
[1:31:30] it's the faith that's inside of you
[1:31:35] so upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:31:37] and the case of hell
[1:31:40] never prevail against it
[1:31:44] glory says only when the supernatural
[1:31:47] begin to manifest itself
[1:31:48] then that could cause the laws to change
[1:31:51] that they will do something about it
[1:31:53] because what would be manifested is
[1:31:54] beyond what pentecostal have and all
[1:31:56] them crazy charlatans and hypocrites and
[1:31:58] false prophets that have all ruled today
[1:32:01] if we don't know like that we are bright
[1:32:03] in action
[1:32:04] you say what means who is this who is
[1:32:07] this
[1:32:08] oh god is this this is that that the
[1:32:10] prophet william branham speak of
[1:32:12] who is this kind of people who are we we
[1:32:14] are the hearts of the children
[1:32:15] we are the children who have hearts have
[1:32:17] returned literally
[1:32:19] back to the fate of the father
[1:32:26] that's why you say what we need is
[1:32:27] thousands of live voices the thunder of
[1:32:29] god
[1:32:30] walking in sweetness and humility the
[1:32:33] devil don't care about a nice message
[1:32:35] i said god they adopted a sermon their
[1:32:37] only only men would only possibly
[1:32:39] adopted them
[1:32:40] god adopted our life you hear what i say
[1:32:44] nothing money you know go on adopting a
[1:32:46] good message a man preacher good message

[1:32:51] that god adopted never see it so it has
[1:32:54] to be a life

[1:58:29] came
[1:58:30] how he lived how he grew up it was not

[1:58:36] promised to
[1:58:37] pause in the last days has its own
[1:58:39] rapping i'll be wrapped in you and i how
[1:58:41] a powerful testimony that god could
[1:58:43] overlook this one and overlook that one
[1:58:45] and overlook your neighbor and overlook
[1:58:47] somebody else to put that gift inside of
[1:58:50] individual sons and daughters of god
[1:58:52] that's something to give god
[1:58:53] praise and thanks for this morning
[1:58:56] amen what a season what a time we're
[1:58:59] living in so may the lord bless you
[1:59:01] we before we get to the prayer request
[1:59:03] we have some
[1:59:04] notes or praises
[1:59:09] i want to read this know the praise this
[1:59:11] is from sister christine
[1:59:13] see torah i'd like to give god all the
[1:59:15] praise on and glory he is real and
[1:59:17] answers prayer
[1:59:18] since the beginning of this year i have
[1:59:20] been praying for god to speak to me and
[1:59:22] show me
[1:59:22] if i'm doing anything wrong if i'm not
[1:59:24] doing what i'm supposed
[1:59:26] to in the way that i'm supposed to do it
[1:59:28] and let me know what changes i had to
[1:59:30] make in my life
[1:59:31] as i did not want anything to keep me
[1:59:33] from receiving the holy spirit
[1:59:35] and being adopted into his kingdom i
[1:59:38] also prayed for him to teach me how to
[1:59:40] pray and what to pray for
[1:59:42] i cannot say that kovit is a blessing
[1:59:44] but i believe all things work together
[1:59:46] for good to them that love god
[1:59:47] and are called according to his purpose
[1:59:50] during this time
[1:59:51] the bible studies have been shown me
[1:59:53] what i should do how i should behave how
[1:59:55] i should speak and more
[1:59:57] it is amazing to actually be part of the
[1:59:59] prayer meeting
[2:00:00] when god is speaking to his servant
[2:00:02] during the exhortation teaching me how
[2:00:03] to pray with fate
[2:00:05] desperation and so much more and to feel
[2:00:07] the presence of god in our home
[2:00:09] i would like to thank god for using his
[2:00:11] servants in such a mighty way to answer
[2:00:13] my prayer
[2:00:14] my god is real and answers prayer god
[2:00:16] bless you i love you sister christine
[2:00:17] you appreciate that this morning
[2:00:23] amen and another note of praise
[2:00:26] from sister susan rajkumar there seems i
[2:00:28] want to thank god for his mercies and
[2:00:30] grace thus far
[2:00:32] uh for the past two weeks i've been
[2:00:33] wrestling to give this testimony
[2:00:35] that all lying devil kept telling me
[2:00:37] don't do it
[2:00:38] about two months ago i lost a bag of
[2:00:40] keys for a building in san diego
[2:00:43] spare keys and all i searched the entire
[2:00:45] house repacked all the drawers and
[2:00:47] vehicles no keys
[2:00:48] i kept that bag in the vehicle in a
[2:00:51] particular draw
[2:00:54] i prayed about it but no definite answer
[2:00:57] a sister was testifying how the neighbor
[2:00:59] found her keys immediately
[2:01:01] i mentioned about the bag of keys and i
[2:01:03] believe that i threw it away in the
[2:01:05] garbage and that i'm in big trouble
[2:01:07] i told i'm going to ask god to create
[2:01:09] the same bag of keys and place it in the
[2:01:11] same drawer
[2:01:12] as a matter of fact it's already done
[2:01:14] three days later
[2:01:15] in sleep i heard a voice telling me go
[2:01:17] to the drawer i forgot all about it a
[2:01:19] few days passed
[2:01:20] as i pulled the draw it fell down tilled
[2:01:22] over and out came the same bag of keys
[2:01:24] given

[2:01:31] god
[2:01:32] you believe he's a god of the impossible
[2:01:35] if thou canst believe he said it's
[2:01:37] anything too hard for the lord
