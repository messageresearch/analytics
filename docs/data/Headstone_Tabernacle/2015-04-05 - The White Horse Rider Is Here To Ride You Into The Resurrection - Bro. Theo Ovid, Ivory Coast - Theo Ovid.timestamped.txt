[20:34] my friend here, brother
[20:36] Etien. Thank him for the
[20:39] translation and these mighty men of
[20:41] valor on the
[20:43] platform. Brother Olu and brother
[20:46] Conte, I call them mighty men of
[20:50] valor. Warriors of the
[20:53] faith. Brother Bannon prayed that
[20:56] prayer. Raise up mighty
[20:59] men. Raise up mighty warriors of the
[21:01] faith.
[21:04] and pray that prayer.
[21:06] Not weak men.
[21:09] Not men without backbone,

[21:13] men, but strong
[21:16] men, warriors of the

[21:43] Lord. Praise God. So, we want to go into
[21:47] the word. Could we
[21:49] stand? We want to read Isaiah
[21:53] 61 verse one and
[21:55] two. Isaiah
[21:58] 63 1 verse verse 4.
[22:01] And Revelation
[22:03] 19 verse 11-
[22:06] 16 says we read Isaiah
[22:09] 61 verse 1 and
[22:18] two. The spirit of the Lord God is upon
[22:20] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[22:22] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[22:25] had sent me to bind up the
[22:26] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[22:29] the captives, the opening of the prison
[22:32] to them that abound, to proclaim the
[22:34] acceptable year of the Lord, and the day
[22:36] of vengeance of our God, to comfort all
[22:39] that mourn.
[22:54] Isaiah chapter 63:4,
[22:59] "For the day of vengeance is in my
[23:00] heart, and the year of my redeemed is
[23:09] come." Revelation chapter 19.
[23:26] reading from verse 11.
[23:30] And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a
[23:32] white horse, and he that sat upon him
[23:34] was called faithful and true, and in
[23:37] righteousness he did judge and make
[23:41] war.
[23:47] His eyes was a flame of fire. On his
[23:49] head were many crowns. He had a name
[23:52] written that no man knew but he
[24:00] himself. And he was clothed with a
[24:02] vesture dipped in blood. And his name is
[24:04] called the word of God.
[24:10] And the armies which were in heaven
[24:12] followed him upon white horses clothed
[24:14] in fine linen, white and clean.
[24:24] And out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[24:26] sword, when with it he should smite the
[24:29] nations, and he shall rule them with a
[24:30] rod of iron. And he treadth the wine
[24:33] press of the fierceness of the wrath of
[24:35] Almighty God.
[24:45] And he had on his vesture on his thigh a
[24:47] name written, King of Kings and Lord of
[24:54] Lords. Let's bow our heads a
[24:58] prayer. Almighty God, we love you
[25:01] tonight and we thank you for your word.
[25:05] Your word have life and strength and
[25:07] power in it. We pray you interpret your
[25:10] word among
[25:11] us. Confirm your word with
[25:14] signs,
[25:16] wonders,
[25:18] miracles, heal the sick in our midst
[25:20] tonight. May virtue, powerful service be
[25:24] released among the people
[25:26] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[25:30] amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Oh,
[25:34] praise God.
[25:36] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Have a
[25:38] title. The white horse rider is here
[25:43] to ride you into the
[25:50] resurrection and have an
[25:53] inspiration. The third
[25:56] pull. Praise God. We thank God for the
[25:59] message this
[26:00] morning. A call to the
[26:03] resurrection and a call to the
[26:06] resurrection is a call to
[26:09] perfection. Because if there's no
[26:12] perfection, there is no
[26:14] resurrection. We are going to be
[26:16] perfect. It takes
[26:18] perfection to bring on the resurrection.
[26:21] Isn't it right? A call to the
[26:24] resurrection is also a call to become
[26:28] the white horse
[26:30] word. Did you hear that? We have to
[26:35] become the white horse
[26:37] word that the white horse
[26:40] rider could mount us to come upon us and
[26:45] ride us into the
[26:47] resurrection. There's going to be a word
[26:51] prayer. There's going to be a scriptural
[26:53] prayer.
[26:55] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[26:58] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[27:01] Hallelujah. You are going to become the
[27:04] word and the spirit will come upon you
[27:09] because the spirit comes upon the word.
[27:13] The spirit is not coming for
[27:15] interpretation. The spirit is not coming
[27:18] from enda. The spirit is coming upon the
[27:22] word. And that's what Jesus said. The
[27:25] spirit is upon me. Who is he? He is the
[27:29] word. His name shall be called the word
[27:33] of God. We going to crown him. We're
[27:37] going to crown him. King of kings. Lord
[27:41] of lords. Oh, glory to God. Oh,
[27:45] hallelujah.
[27:49] Oh, blessed. You may be seated.
[27:52] It's
[27:53] amazing how the Bible could say, "The
[27:57] year of my redeemer has come.
[27:59] and vengeance is in my heart. You know
[28:02] what that means? The year of the
[28:05] redeemed. It means he going to redeem
[28:08] your
[28:09] soul. He going to redeem your spirit. He
[28:12] going to redeem your body. That's what
[28:14] it means. It means there's going to be a
[28:18] rapture. It means that we are leaving
[28:20] here.
[28:22] Oh, glory to God. Amen. You may be
[28:25] seated. This is brother Brandham.
[28:28] from the breach. He said, "This book is
[28:31] a mysterious
[28:32] book. It's a book of
[28:34] redemption." And when the seven angels
[28:36] begin to
[28:38] sound, he winds up the loose
[28:41] ends and the mysteries of
[28:44] God come down from
[28:46] God as the word of
[28:49] God and reveals the entire revelation of
[28:53] God. Now, you may be
[28:55] seated. Now, listen to this.
[28:58] The prophet who wrote the word
[29:00] that the song of the seven church
[29:04] age the loose ends that they probe
[29:09] that will be wound up together.
[29:13] Here we go. And when the seals are
[29:16] broke and the mystery is
[29:19] revealed, down come the angel,
[29:23] the messenger,
[29:26] Christ setting his foot upon the land
[29:28] and sea,
[29:30] the seventh
[29:31] angel is on the earth at the time of his
[29:36] coming. What does that mean? The Lord
[29:40] has descended.
[29:48] Africa. Africa. Are you hearing me?
[29:51] [Applause]
[29:57] William Brham. William. He came to
[30:00] introduce Messiah.
[30:04] Messiah is on the air.
[30:08] [Applause]
[30:18] Oh my. You may be
[30:21] seated from uniting time and
[30:24] sign. What the madam said, God sent the
[30:28] seven seals
[30:30] and give us a sign by
[30:33] air and send seven
[30:35] angels out of heaven to come to bring
[30:39] back that scattered
[30:40] word in them
[30:43] denominations and tie it back into the
[30:46] world to bring down the Holy
[30:49] Spirit to the seven angels that came
[30:53] from eternity. They came to gather
[30:56] up all the
[30:58] loose, all the scattered way. It has to
[31:02] come back to the world,
[31:05] the full
[31:07] way.
[31:09] Hallelujah. Do you understand?
[31:12] seven angels. In other words, the Holy
[31:17] Spirit
[31:18] couldn't come back until the entire
[31:22] world was restored.
[31:25] The voice of God was in seven
[31:29] ages. God and was the
[31:32] gather all the seven parts to bring back
[31:36] one voice, the voice of the archangel.
[31:40] and William Brana that Elijah was sent
[31:45] to introduce
[31:47] Messiah. Messia is on the earth. The
[31:51] pillar of fire is on earth. The pillar
[31:54] of fire is here
[31:57] tonight. The pillar of fire is upon you.
[32:01] [Applause]
[32:16] Glory. Hallelujah.
[32:19] Praise God. Blessed. You may be seated.
[32:23] Hallelujah. Brother,
[32:26] is this the time sir?
[32:29] He said Revelation 3 and 4. Revelation
[32:32] 10 3 and 4. Seven thunders. Notice they
[32:37] brought forth those
[32:38] voices with one foot upon the land,
[32:42] one foot upon the sea.
[32:44] But if the ministry of the
[32:48] mysteries is finished,
[32:50] then what of those seven mysteries
[32:52] coming
[32:55] forth? in a homaly church like
[32:58] ours that almighty
[33:01] God has come and regarded the lowest of
[33:05] his people.
[33:08] You say, "I don't think so. It might not
[33:12] be." But what if it is then time has run
[33:17] out? It may be later than you think.
[33:20] Brother, say it again. Your message will
[33:24] wind up the loose
[33:26] ends. Listen and introduce the Messiah
[33:31] before his coming.
[33:34] Messiah before the coming. That's not
[33:38] some
[33:39] man's. That's not some man. That's the
[33:43] mighty angel. The one with the swept
[33:46] back wings. The one with the seven seal.
[33:50] That's the Messiah.
[33:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[33:57] Glory. You may be seated. From feast of
[34:01] the trumpets. Brother Brandon and
[34:04] brother spoke a little bit on it. Go
[34:07] into the prophet's
[34:09] chamber. Watch them seven steps. Where
[34:13] did the God meet the
[34:15] challenge to bring the come the presence
[34:17] of the
[34:19] king at the top of the
[34:21] step on the seventh step and that shows
[34:26] the same spirit that was upon John had
[34:30] introduced a Messiah? We have got to
[34:33] come to a
[34:34] place something that's going to
[34:37] introduce Messiah.
[34:39] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Now here
[34:42] it
[34:42] is. How will you know the
[34:46] Messiah unless you are consciously in
[34:49] the
[34:50] word? You have got to know you have to
[34:52] be in the
[34:53] word because the
[34:55] Messiah comes according to the
[34:59] scripture for the time and
[35:02] season. Every scripture have a time and
[35:05] season. everything under the earth
[35:08] according to Ecclesiastical 3. There's a
[35:11] time and season for everything under the
[35:14] sun. There's a time for you to be
[35:16] healed. There's a time for you to be
[35:19] healed. There's a time for you to be
[35:21] delivered. There's a time for you to be
[35:24] filled. And I am believing today is that
[35:28] time. Now is that time. There's a time
[35:31] for God to come amongst his people.
[35:35] There's a time for God to bring a
[35:38] shaking shaken on the earth. Maybe it
[35:42] will start here right in ivory coast. A
[35:47] shaking a power coming amongst the
[35:50] people where man will speak the word.
[35:54] Man will speak the word and it will
[35:57] flash like
[35:58] that. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. What
[36:02] is it?
[36:04] It's the third P.
[36:06] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to
[36:09] God. Glory to you. Hallelujah.
[36:11] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham and proven
[36:14] his
[36:15] word. He said he is the
[36:17] word is not right. Revelation the 19th
[36:21] chapter coming bride and groom.
[36:25] His vesture dipped in
[36:27] blood. His name is called the word of
[36:30] God. He is the quickening power.
[36:34] He is the Holy Spirit. That's the
[36:37] dynamics to come to your
[36:39] mechanics. He Christ is the quick power.
[36:43] He is the Holy Spirit. You shall receive
[36:47] power. When when the Holy Spirit come
[36:51] upon you, then you're going to be a
[36:53] witness. The Holy Ghost, not shake some
[36:56] minister hand. The Holy Ghost, not
[37:00] believe some teachings. The Holy Ghost.
[37:03] The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost and fire.
[37:06] Holy Ghost and power. Holy Ghost. Holy
[37:09] Ghost. Holy Ghost. Same old time
[37:12] singing. Same old time shouting. Same
[37:15] old time preaching.
[37:25] Glory. Wow. from harvest
[37:28] time. Brother Brandham said the word
[37:31] it's a chain and you are hanging over
[37:35] hell by one word. You hang over hell.
[37:41] When you're walking on the word, you're
[37:43] walking on a bridge. If you break that
[37:46] word, you will fall into hell. We stand
[37:50] on the way. man shall not live by bread
[37:53] alone but by every word that comes out
[37:57] the mouth of God and the mouth of God is
[38:01] not some
[38:04] fivefold the mouth of God is the
[38:07] prophet and the fivefold could only
[38:11] echo what the prophet have
[38:14] said we are not following
[38:16] men we are following the word as spoken
[38:20] by a prophet like the party
[38:32] prophets. You may be seated. The
[38:35] five-fold
[38:37] and the people will become the voice of
[38:40] God will become the voice of God in the
[38:44] last days. But men,
[38:47] imposttors,
[38:49] impersonators, want people to follow
[38:51] them. We are not called to follow a
[38:54] group, no group, no group. We called to
[38:58] follow the
[38:59] world. Oh, glory to God. God call
[39:05] Israel as a nation. But the Gentiles,
[39:09] God scatter us across the world to call
[39:13] us as
[39:15] individuals. That is why
[39:18] you have to hear your name. It's not a
[39:22] group name. It is your name. And when
[39:26] you see your name, you're going to get
[39:31] your anointing. See, because your
[39:33] anointed coming to you, Jesus said, The
[39:38] spirit is upon me. This is my anointing.
[39:42] The spirit upon the word for the hour.
[39:56] Brother Brandham said it this way. Man
[39:58] shall hang over
[40:00] hell by every
[40:02] word that proceed out of the mouth of
[40:04] God.
[40:06] Second Timothy 4. It says, "I charge you
[40:09] before God.
[40:11] Preach the word. Be instant in season.
[40:19] Rebuke,
[40:21] reprove,
[40:22] exalt with all longsuffering and
[40:24] doctrine.
[40:26] For the time will come." Here we go.
[40:30] The time will come that they will not
[40:33] endure sound
[40:35] doctrines but after their own
[40:38] lust. There's a lust in them to hear new
[40:42] things to hear mysterious things to hear
[40:45] things the prophet didn't
[40:48] speak. Hallelujah. The time will come
[40:52] that they will their door sound
[40:54] doctrine,
[40:56] but after their own
[40:58] lust shall they heap to themselves
[41:01] teachers, having itching
[41:04] ears, and they shall turn away from
[41:06] their ears from the
[41:08] truth, and shall be turned into
[41:12] fables. Paul warned them. Be careful of
[41:16] those teachers that bringing all kind of
[41:19] crazy
[41:21] stuff to stimulate your intellect,
[41:25] to stimulate your
[41:26] mind. And afterwards, you start to
[41:30] believe in
[41:31] fables. Oh glory, Acts
[41:34] 20 verse 27. Listen what it says. Paul
[41:39] said, "I have not shunned to declare
[41:42] unto you all the council of
[41:45] God. Take heed therefore unto
[41:49] yourselves and to all the
[41:52] flock over which the Holy Ghost had made
[41:54] you
[41:56] overseer to feed the
[41:58] church. For I know
[42:00] this, after my departed,
[42:04] grievous
[42:05] wolves will enter in among you.
[42:08] not sparing the flock.
[42:11] [Music]
[42:12] Listen to
[42:13] Paul also
[42:16] of your own
[42:18] selves in your own inspiration,
[42:22] of your own
[42:23] selves. Men shall rise up speaking
[42:28] perverse
[42:29] things to draw disciples after
[42:32] themselves.
[42:35] Therefore, watcher and
[42:38] remember for three years. I cease not to
[42:42] warn
[42:43] you night and day.
[42:47] So poor. I was to warn the people of
[42:51] wolves, of
[42:53] snakes, of evil workers, of false
[42:57] prophets, of false
[43:00] pastors, of men that God didn't even
[43:04] call. Oh, hallelujah. You have to warn
[43:08] them. And if Paul warned them, we going
[43:11] to warn you of men with lying spirits.
[43:17] They should be out of the pullpit.
[43:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[43:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[43:27] seated on the fourth seal.
[43:30] Brother Brandham. Now the antichrist
[43:33] is on a pale
[43:35] horse mixed
[43:37] colors. A horse represents a
[43:41] power. It is national
[43:44] powers, religious
[43:46] powers, demon
[43:48] powers, all kind of powers. That's a
[43:51] mixed
[43:53] horse. But Christ is on a solid white
[43:56] horse.
[43:59] Christ is on a solid
[44:02] white unadulterated word from the
[44:05] beginning.
[44:07] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[44:10] Oh, glory to God. So, brother Brandham
[44:13] was preaching about Christ being that
[44:17] pure word, unchanging word, original
[44:21] word, not mixed with interpretation, not
[44:24] mixed with men's idea. That's the white
[44:27] horse. and listen to his prayer.
[44:31] Lord, how thankful we
[44:34] are. I'm so glad, so happy for you and
[44:39] your people. You purchase our salvation
[44:42] on Calvary.
[44:45] Lord, try us by your spirit. And if
[44:50] there any be evil among
[44:53] us, any unbelief of the
[44:55] word, any person in
[44:58] here that would not
[45:00] punctuate every promise of God with an
[45:05] amen, may the Holy Spirit come down now,
[45:10] the white horse rider.
[45:13] The prophet identify the Holy Spirit as
[45:18] the white horse rider.
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:26] So you are going to be the word. You are
[45:30] going to be the word that the Holy
[45:33] Spirit going to ride down to the
[45:39] resurrection. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:41] Glory to the Lord. Hallelujah.
[45:44] Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[45:48] Praise God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:51] So that means a bride has to become the
[45:55] white horse word. Isn't that right? The
[45:58] third pull, opening of the word. Praise
[46:02] God. Oh my. You may be seated from the
[46:06] seventh seal. Brother Brandham, he said,
[46:09] "If you want to do
[46:11] something, don't tell anybody about
[46:14] it because Satan will hear it."
[46:18] Now, watch. I I I have people do a
[46:20] certain
[46:22] thing and watch the devil try to cut it
[46:26] off. Here we go. This is good. Satan
[46:31] will try to
[46:32] impersonate. He will try to impersonate
[46:36] everything that the church will do. We
[46:39] notice through the
[46:41] antichrist. But this is one
[46:43] thing. He cannot imperson it. There will
[46:47] be no mimics to
[46:49] it
[46:52] because he don't know
[46:55] it. There is no way for him to know it.
[46:59] It is the third P.
[47:12] So
[47:13] church we have come to a
[47:16] spot what we are breaking
[47:19] into. There is no
[47:22] impersonation
[47:24] nowhere. They cannot impersonate
[47:28] it. Oh
[47:31] hallelujah. He said he
[47:33] listen he knows nothing about it.
[47:38] See, he doesn't understand it.
[47:42] [Applause]
[47:49] You may be seated. So, brother
[47:52] Brandham in vision he said, "I see the
[47:56] light in his 10
[47:58] vision. I see the light. Leave me and go
[48:02] into the building." And a voice said, "I
[48:06] will meet you in
[48:07] there." And that will be the third
[48:10] pole. Why? It will not be a public
[48:14] show. And all the things he
[48:16] said connecting to the third
[48:19] pole have a
[48:21] scripture to
[48:23] identify. So he identify five things at
[48:27] the third pole.
[48:29] Number one, the 10
[48:31] vision, the scripture. I will meet you
[48:34] in there. The prophet got Matthew
[48:38] 66. When thou prayest in thy closet,
[48:43] shut thy door, pray to thy father which
[48:47] is in secret, and thy father which
[48:52] seek shall reward thee
[48:54] openly.
[48:56] Superas Matthew 6 and tie that in to the
[49:01] 10th vision.
[49:03] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[49:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number two,
[49:10] he identify
[49:12] the spoken word as the
[49:15] temple. Before the doctors and touches
[49:18] my wife,
[49:20] the tumor will go
[49:21] down. That's the spoken word. In the
[49:26] scripture in Mark 11:23,
[49:30] if you shall say to this mountain, be
[49:35] moved and don't doubt in your
[49:37] heart, you can have what you say.
[49:42] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[49:46] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number
[49:50] three, he
[49:51] identified the king sword as the third
[49:55] power. The king saw not a king but he
[50:01] king. The king saw and he
[50:05] identified. S John
[50:07] 15:7 if he abide in me and my words
[50:11] abide in you. Ask what you will. He
[50:15] identify. Hebrews
[50:17] 4:12. The word is quick and powerful and
[50:22] sharper than any two-edged sword. Oh,
[50:26] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:29] Praise God.
[50:32] You may be seated.
[50:34] Number four, he identified the third P
[50:37] as the opening of the word scripture.
[50:41] Luke 24 verse
[50:44] 27 at beginning at
[50:47] Moses and all the prophets speaking
[50:50] about Jesus. He expounded unto them in
[50:54] all the scriptures the things concerning
[50:59] himself. Luke
[51:01] 24:45 then open their
[51:04] understanding that they might understand
[51:06] the
[51:07] scriptures. That's the scripture for the
[51:10] word being
[51:12] open. And the last one, number five,
[51:16] souls in prison.
[51:18] And the scripture, first Peter 3,
[51:22] verse 18, for Christ suffered once for
[51:27] sins, the just for the
[51:29] unjust that he might bring to
[51:32] God, being put to death in the
[51:36] flesh, but quickened by the spirit.
[51:40] Here we go. by which also
[51:43] he went and preached into the spirits in
[51:47] prison which sometimes were disobedient.
[51:52] Oh hallelujah. Could we give the Lord a
[51:54] hand of praise?
[51:56] Glory to God.
[51:59] Glory to God.
[52:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother
[52:04] Brandham, sir, this is a time I know
[52:07] James said
[52:09] greater, but you couldn't do nothing
[52:11] greater.
[52:14] You could only do more.
[52:17] He was one
[52:18] person. Now he's in a whole church
[52:21] now. More than this shall you
[52:25] do. For I go to my father.
[52:28] is is if this is the
[52:32] temple then there's a great ministry
[52:34] liner here.
[52:36] Oh glory to God. So
[52:39] first was little birds.
[52:43] Isn't that right? Then was
[52:45] doves then the third was angels.
[52:49] And from
[52:51] indictment he said may they come for a
[52:54] revival of the just.
[52:56] Here we go. and great
[52:59] power come among the church. So we can
[53:03] expect that
[53:04] tonight because that's a promise. That's
[53:07] a promise. We can expect the sick to be
[53:11] healed tonight because this is the word
[53:14] here. This can't
[53:16] fail. Listen to this. May there come a
[53:19] revival of the just
[53:21] and great power come among the church
[53:25] just before it's going.
[53:29] Listen, it's not hard to pray
[53:33] that because you promised it and we are
[53:37] looking Lord for that third pull that we
[53:41] know will do great things in our
[53:46] midst. Oh hallelujah hallelujah brother
[53:49] Brandham I'm looking for the third pull
[53:53] for something to happen to start that
[53:55] third
[53:56] pull and if we want to see that third
[53:59] pull really do among
[54:01] us it's a coordination with every one of
[54:04] us to humble ourselves before
[54:07] God confess our wrong and pray for these
[54:12] things oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh
[54:15] glory glory oh glory Glory. Hallelujah.
[54:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[54:21] Glory.
[54:23] Hallelujah.
[54:25] Brother Brandham, he had a first pull
[54:28] healing. He had a second pull
[54:31] prophesying and rebuking spirits and he
[54:34] had a third pull to open the word. Isn't
[54:37] that right? He had that ministry. And
[54:40] the bride will have that ministry. So
[54:42] you cannot just say first P.
[54:47] He's sweet.
[54:49] He's not talking doctrine.
[54:51] Son of righteousness.
[54:53] A rise of heal on his wing.
[54:56] He is going
[54:57] everywhere. Everybody love brother
[55:00] Brown. Everybody love the
[55:02] prophet. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He even
[55:05] using the word
[55:07] trinity among them. But after a
[55:10] while, I hold back no more.
[55:14] Trinity is of the devil.
[55:16] He said there is no part in the Bible
[55:18] like God said trinity. He start to bust
[55:21] them. He start to rebuke them because he
[55:25] was coming into the message.
[55:28] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. In other
[55:30] words to catch the bride.
[55:37] You know what caught you?
[55:40] takes the third pull
[55:42] to pull the
[55:46] bride. Only the bride.
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:53] You may be seated.
[55:55] One time Jesus had 82
[55:59] disciples. Once Jesus had 82
[56:03] disciples. And when Jesus give a
[56:06] word, eat my flesh and drink my
[56:09] blood, 70 walk
[56:12] away, 12
[56:14] remain and one was a
[56:16] devil. Isn't that
[56:18] right? But watch when he died and rose
[56:23] from the
[56:24] dead in his resurrection
[56:27] ministry. He only came to his
[56:32] elect. I I'm not hearing
[56:35] you. When Jesus rose from the dead,
[56:40] he didn't appear to no make
[56:43] believer. He didn't appear to no
[56:45] unbeliever. He appeared to his
[56:49] disciple that was going to get
[56:52] power. Jesus, the voice of the
[56:55] archangel, the third Bible, the open of
[56:59] the word.
[57:01] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[57:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Understand this.
[57:08] When Jesus died at Calvary. That was
[57:13] Friday. Saturday. It looks like nothing
[57:17] happened. Nothing happened. Jesus went
[57:21] down to the souls in prison and he had
[57:25] to preach. I am the man Noah was talking
[57:30] about.
[57:32] I am the
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:42] man. So
[57:44] all all the proud
[57:47] and arrogant
[57:50] in this message
[57:53] have to hear the
[57:54] gospel preached.
[57:57] Oh my. The bride is not waiting for
[58:02] signs and
[58:03] wonders to confirm who they
[58:06] are because the
[58:08] revelation places you who you are
[58:11] reveals to you who you are. When
[58:15] Godam said when the door is
[58:19] shut, God will anoint the church.
[58:23] In other words, when the
[58:25] redeemed is coming
[58:28] forth, vengeance
[58:30] is coming
[58:33] forth. When the
[58:35] redeem is coming forth, the wrath of God
[58:40] is coming
[58:41] forth. And Jesus when he read that
[58:44] scripture in Isaiah
[58:47] 61, he left he leave out a part to
[58:50] declare the day of
[58:52] vengeance of our
[58:54] God. No man could declare that. No man
[59:00] could accomplish that. When Christ
[59:03] feeling a bride, eyes of fire out of the
[59:07] mouth, a two-edged sword, the word of
[59:11] God, the world going to be
[59:14] shaken, rocking under the impact of the
[59:18] word being spoken word by word by word.
[59:32] So brother is speaking. A woman lives in
[59:35] worldly
[59:37] pleasure is dead while she is
[59:39] living. And if she rejects
[59:42] mercy, she can cross the separating
[59:45] line and there's no place for her no
[59:48] more. And what when she cross that
[59:51] line, there is no way to come
[59:55] back. But There's got to be a
[59:59] ministry preached to her. The ones that
[1:00:03] cross the
[1:00:04] land still have to be preached
[1:00:07] to the ones that don't
[1:00:10] believe they have to hear it. That's why
[1:00:13] Jesus said,
[1:00:16] war, rumors and war, not
[1:00:20] yet. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:23] Earthquakes, not yet. But this
[1:00:27] gospel must be preached and then shall
[1:00:30] ye come. And the gospel is
[1:00:35] not in word
[1:00:37] only, mysteries only, deep teachings
[1:00:41] only. The gospel is in power and
[1:00:47] demonstration. The gospel is the
[1:00:51] demonstrate the power of God.
[1:00:55] I suspect
[1:01:02] you. So said there's got to be a
[1:01:06] ministry preached to her. But remember
[1:01:08] at that time, it's over. It's done. It's
[1:01:14] just a
[1:01:15] haunting. The lamb took the book. His
[1:01:18] redemption is over.
[1:01:22] Jesus first preached
[1:01:24] and was
[1:01:25] rejected and went and haunted those that
[1:01:28] were there
[1:01:30] that could not
[1:01:32] repent. No time for
[1:01:35] salvation. That same ministry will have
[1:01:38] to repeat
[1:01:39] again. What if that could be the third
[1:01:42] pull to the eternal loss? Oh
[1:01:46] glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His
[1:01:50] temple, Jesus staple was when he
[1:01:54] preached to the lost who could not be
[1:01:57] saved no
[1:01:58] more. That's why you should be shouting
[1:02:02] and praising God for the blood of
[1:02:04] redemption.
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:16] You
[1:02:18] do you realize
[1:02:21] that the bride will be God's
[1:02:23] representative on the earth?
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:40] After a while,
[1:02:42] you get nothing except through the
[1:02:45] bride. But Brandham said, "By and
[1:02:49] through the
[1:02:50] bride, by and through the
[1:02:53] bride will be accomplished."
[1:02:57] All that was spoken.
[1:03:00] The bride, Mrs. Jesus, the elected have
[1:03:05] to pick up scripture that Jesus did not
[1:03:08] finish. The pride have to pick up the
[1:03:12] day of vengeance of our
[1:03:14] God. The pride have to pick up a hidden
[1:03:18] mystery. In Revelation
[1:03:21] 22:17, Revelation
[1:03:23] 2:17 is a hidden mystery. In the time of
[1:03:27] judgment, the voice of God into your
[1:03:31] family, go into your loved ones. The
[1:03:34] spirit and the bride, they come.
[1:03:38] Whosoever will
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:53] come, not speaking in tongue.
[1:03:57] Not by dancing in the spirit,
[1:03:59] not by joining church. It's by the word
[1:04:02] living.
[1:04:04] If they only looked,
[1:04:06] he was Messiah.
[1:04:10] He was the living
[1:04:11] word made manifest. Manifest. Oh, glory
[1:04:15] to God. Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:19] The third pearl was the opening of them
[1:04:22] seven seals
[1:04:24] to reveal the hidden truth that been
[1:04:27] sealed in the word and the mysteries of
[1:04:30] God come down from God as the word of
[1:04:34] God and reveal the whole revelation of
[1:04:36] God. The mysteries of God don't come
[1:04:39] down and say as mysteries
[1:04:43] once it come down it becomes word and
[1:04:46] when we preach the word we are preaching
[1:04:48] the mysteries to you the mysteries going
[1:04:52] past the
[1:04:53] intellect mysteries the voice of God
[1:04:57] speaking to your soul the mysteries not
[1:05:01] addressing your spirit your flesh but
[1:05:04] the mysteries coming to fit inside your
[1:05:07] soul
[1:05:08] But Jesus told the disciples. Jesus told
[1:05:11] the disciples the mystery is this. The
[1:05:15] word is a seed. It's how you know the
[1:05:18] mysteries. This the beginning of the
[1:05:19] mysteries. You got to know the word.
[1:05:22] It's a seed. And if the word which is a
[1:05:25] seed, it's the good soil is going to
[1:05:29] bring forth.
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:35] So, brother Brandham, I'm about to
[1:05:38] close.
[1:05:40] He said, "I've got my
[1:05:41] mind set on this
[1:05:44] message." That's that third
[1:05:46] pole. And it's the one I must be loyal
[1:05:50] and reverent
[1:05:51] to. So, this third pole when he preached
[1:05:55] to the
[1:05:56] Lord, they couldn't be saved no more.
[1:06:00] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:02] Hallelujah. Glory
[1:06:05] tree is perfection.
[1:06:07] The ministry
[1:06:09] comes to its perfection
[1:06:12] when it reproduce
[1:06:14] Christ again in the natural amongst
[1:06:18] human being. Men claiming to be God. Men
[1:06:22] claiming to be the Holy Ghost. Men
[1:06:24] claiming all kind of stuff. But
[1:06:27] brotherham said tree is perfection.
[1:06:31] The ministry comes to its perfection
[1:06:35] when it reproduced Christ. We saw Christ
[1:06:39] in William R. You could take any book
[1:06:43] and see how we live, how we acted, how
[1:06:46] we treated people, how he forgive, how
[1:06:50] we restored, how we pray. You can read
[1:06:54] that. That is Christ. You have to see
[1:06:58] that reproduce itself.
[1:07:12] I
[1:07:13] think I think people forget what
[1:07:15] Christian is.
[1:07:18] I think people for Christian is what you
[1:07:21] could
[1:07:23] talk. I think people people no longer
[1:07:27] receive a live voice is the thunder that
[1:07:30] shakes the
[1:07:31] devil. It look like the more we
[1:07:34] talk we think the devil is shaking with
[1:07:38] that. The devil just laughs at
[1:07:41] that. He he laugh at them in the upper
[1:07:44] room. He said they just having a good
[1:07:47] time. They just stagger him. They
[1:07:50] looking like drunk men. Satan said,
[1:07:54] "Don't bother with them." But then Peter
[1:07:57] walked out. You can't stay in the upper
[1:07:59] room. You got to walk out. You got to
[1:08:03] walk out. You got to walk out. That's
[1:08:06] when things begin to start.
[1:08:09] When we walk out and we are walking out
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:21] next when Peter walked out the upper
[1:08:25] room on his way, he saw the man.
[1:08:29] Everybody knows that man. Everybody
[1:08:32] accustomed giving coins to
[1:08:33] God. Everybody knows that man.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Peter
[1:08:41] doing what you're accustomed to do.
[1:08:44] He put his hand in his pocket
[1:08:47] and that apostle was
[1:08:49] broke. He had no
[1:08:52] money. He
[1:08:54] eas said go. I don't have what I have
[1:09:00] God gave me. And what God gave me, I can
[1:09:04] give you. Rise up and walk.
[1:09:22] Listen. When that was done,
[1:09:26] those demons said, "You see that? You
[1:09:29] see that? That's Jesus again.
[1:09:41] We thought
[1:09:43] Satan sought
[1:09:45] but we killed the man
[1:09:48] but it looked like his
[1:09:50] spirit his spirit is now upon other
[1:09:56] men Jesus multiply himself.
[1:10:06] Oh, the devil is in trouble.
[1:10:09] The devil is in trouble. The devil is in
[1:10:12] trouble.
[1:10:13] Listen to this. Listen to this. The
[1:10:18] devil can't get
[1:10:21] stronger, but you can. You can get
[1:10:26] stronger.
[1:10:42] Let's go.
[1:11:02] Watch
[1:11:05] the Pentecostal
[1:11:07] can impersonate anything that can be
[1:11:09] done. But when that time comes, when the
[1:11:13] squeeze come
[1:11:14] down, what you have seen
[1:11:17] temporarily will be
[1:11:19] manifested in its
[1:11:21] fullness of its power. He is
[1:11:24] prophesying.
[1:11:26] What I am
[1:11:27] doing that's
[1:11:29] temporary but when the bright time come
[1:11:32] when the year of the redeem come when
[1:11:35] the time of power come when the
[1:11:38] anointing
[1:11:39] strike when the dynamic strike has come
[1:11:42] when the
[1:11:43] spirit comes upon the
[1:11:53] breath. Understand this
[1:11:56] soul.
[1:11:59] The
[1:12:00] soul sealed.
[1:12:03] The soul sealed
[1:12:06] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:09] The seed inside the soul.
[1:12:12] Your
[1:12:13] spirit sealed.
[1:12:16] Seven
[1:12:17] spirit replacing your human spirit.
[1:12:21] There's only one thing left.
[1:12:24] the redemption of the body.
[1:12:33] So what going to happen?
[1:12:36] There's going to be fire on the inside
[1:12:39] and God represent
[1:12:40] charity. Charity fire
[1:12:44] on the outside
[1:12:46] and your
[1:12:47] body in a moment in a twinkle of an
[1:12:52] eye shall be
[1:13:10] saved. Oh glory.
[1:13:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[1:13:15] close with this final quote.
[1:13:18] Now, if you know peoples around
[1:13:20] here that is
[1:13:23] sick and wants to be prayed
[1:13:26] for, you bring them here
[1:13:28] tonight and you have to bring them
[1:13:31] anyway. Bring them here tonight.
[1:13:34] If the people want to be prayed for,
[1:13:38] the Lord willing, will we be here to
[1:13:40] pray for
[1:13:41] everybody cuz I feel that third pull is
[1:13:47] beginning to
[1:13:48] move within
[1:13:50] me and I want to pray for
[1:13:53] everybody. The prophet said he is
[1:13:56] feeling the third pole moving and we
[1:13:59] feel
[1:14:00] tonight. Jesus Christ the same
[1:14:04] yesterday, today and forever. If he heal
[1:14:08] in times past, he has got to heal
[1:14:12] tonight. If the
