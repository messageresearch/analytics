again in one you have let it be a sweet sweet child yeah God bless you and thanks for coming and such an atmosphere here this morning we want to go into the scriptures we want to read from Saint Mark chapter 7 what are we from 1 to 23. we want to read Psalms 24 1-6 and we also want to read psalms 43 Verse 3 and 4. reading said Mark chapter 7 reading verse 1. then came together unto him the Pharisees and the sitting of the scribes which came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of the disciples eat bread were defiled that is to say with unwashing hands they fall forward foreign for the Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands off eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things they be which they had received a whole as the washing of Cups and pots Brazen vessels of tables then the Pharisees and describe ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashing hands he answered and said unto them well prophesy of you hypocrites and it is written this people honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me albeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandments of God your whole the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and he said unto them full well ye reject the Commandments of God that he may keep your own tradition for Moses said honor thy father thy mother and who's ever Christian father and mother let him die to death but you see if a man shall see it his father or mother it is common that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou might just be profited by he shall be free and you suffer him no more to do or for his father or his mother making the word of God of non-effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them to me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can Define him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man if any man our Bears stay here let him hear and when he had entered the house from the people the disciples asked him concerning the parable he said unto them so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entering it into the man it cannot defile him because it entered not into his heart but into his belly and going out into the drought put in all meets he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for within out of the heart of men perceive evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye a blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man you go to Psalms 24. want to read verse one to six the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for yet founded it upon the Seas and establish it upon the floods who shall Ascend unto the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o Jacob sillah and last scripture from Psalms 43 was three and four oh send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy Holy Hill unto thy Tabernacles then will I go on to the altar of God unto God my exceeding Joy ye upon the harp will I praise thee o God my god let's bore her one more time father we read your word and I I I I I I I I I I ask that you helped me today Father take me out of the way you know what's up in my heart you know what you lay upon me Jesus you'll be writing me for a while and Lord I've been gonna speak on it today and I pray a blessed and interpret it to the hearts and lives of your children and Jesus you may ask it amen you may be seated praise the Lord all right [Music] I'm a title who shall Ascend unto the hill of the Lord that's the title the question who shall ascend unto the heavy Lord our subject Clean Hands and pure heart and I have an inspiration the voice of the archangel thank you I want to appreciate that song from the Sunday School holy holy holy I want to see you I didn't know what Sunday was going to sing but I was so glad to hear that because we want to see him and Jesus said in Matthew 5 8 I believe it is blessed other pure in heart for they shall see God are you ready for the word this morning all right so here we go I'll see what the Lord will do I am so dependent on him this morning all right this is Brother Branham and this is praying for the message God keep his word Our God we come to thee in the name of thy beloved Son who has bitters to come see knocks the father anything in my name I will do it and we come in Jesus name the first repent of our own sin and our shortcomings to ask thee to cleanse us from all our iniquity and to purge our thinking that we will think upon the things that are right and pertaining to the kingdom of God and may your thoughts be tonight on something that would better the kingdom of God Amen would better the people that are in the kingdom and may our hearts be purged from all full things we desire to walk upright before thee with Clean Hands and a pure heart oh God Alone can do this we pray father to cleanse our hands and purify our hearts wash Us in the waters of separation from the things of the world by the word and made through the word that was said you are cling to the word and we pray that the world will switch deep into our hearts tonight and when cleanse us from all unbelief that our hearts be renewed in the holy spirit that he may bring us tonight those things that are profitable to the kingdom of God help Lord those who are feeble along the way find it difficult and believe in the word I know God in this dark and treacherous hour we are living as we look ahead for the world crisis we only see Darkness ahead but dawah said look up when these things begin to happen for Redemption is joined now Mary be exalted tonight and by the Holy Spirit to take this to heart to look up in the face of the god of Heaven who has promised our Redemption at this time and as Jonathan the part most prayed even so come Lord Jesus we pray that you will grant these things to us tonight and heal all the sick and Afflicted Comfort the sins call Sinners to repentance and renew all of us as we go on from here tightening on the full armor of God to go as soldiers before prepared for the back that lays before us and As We Gather tonight each and pray and the ban over us the Morning Star leading away and the host of the enemy has camped and camped also their great Challenger comes out and makes us both saying these days Americans are passed but God raise up as David a warrior a challenger and me that Spirit Well in every heart richly for we ask in Jesus name amen what a prayer tonight Oh Glory to God hallelujah he says search me and try me we want to serve you with a pure heart and Clean Hands for we know not what hour you may call us and summon us on high Oh Glory to God up to your heart a heart push of hypocrisy a heart put some corrupt desires I had careful to get approved before God oh glory to God Hallelujah the scripture we read who have not lifted up his soul to vanity no sworn deceitfully who does not value or desire the vein things of life such as honor and riches and Pleasures but make God his portion God I want you to be my portion I want you to be my joy I want you to remind everything Oh Glory to God hallelujah do you believe that Hallelujah but Ibraham said this from the voice of the sign he said no one was a sign I was going to skip down you may have the biggest church in the country you may have more money than you ever got that ain't got one thing to do with it you might associate with what you call Better intellectual crowd you might wear a better suit of clothes but brother God wants a clean heart and a Clean Hands he want a cleaned up church that he can show himself you see the early church was a pure church because the self-christ here was to have to go and get an alliance then they bring out the stake so to be to be a Christian at that time you have to be killed you knew he was going to be killed so the church had no room for Hypocrites had no room for compromises because I will take her to the stake they will burn you on fire the church was pure because there was a persecution one says persecution the church is pure and quarters and fire upon your lights Oh Glory to God hallelujah he will send it Oh Glory to God when God spread forth his wings and shows his power that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to God and you have to have that representation in You by predestination and we preach about it on Wednesday night my God for knowledge he predestinate you he knew you because he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he knew you would receive the word he knew that you were not going to receive the word just ultimately and formally but inwardly and willingly or give the Lord a shout he knew you would receive the word not awkwardly and formally but inwardly and willingly Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah Jesus was the Living Word and when he came the church WIll rejected him the Sinners receive him now here is bum this little woman with a pure heart that's one of the well up your heart and I be fired buddy and the Pharisee with the pure body and a desired heart it condemned one and save the other or give the Lord a shout everybody see that woman shattered the five body she was a little prostitute almost but God saw what was in our heart that's why Jesus can tell her go call your husband because he wanted to pinpoint what was a motive what was objective and whenever it enters her life he saw where she was doing her stuff because she had a minor children or give the Lord a shout sometimes it's more than midi eyes you can't judge by whatever I see but you have to go down and see what God sees in the heart and when you look inside the heart of the Bride he see his Gene is he a seed he see a strum and that is why we can praise God tonight that is why we can Rejoice not because devils are subject but because our names it's written in the blood section of the book oh [Applause] all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord who shall stand in his holy place he shall he that had Clean Hands on a pure heart who had not lifted up his sold the vanity no sworn deceitfully vanity what is Vanity excessive Pride admiration of one owns appearance or achievements Hallelujah it is self-conceit it is self-love it is self-absorption self-obsession self-centeredness egotism that is Vanity where you feel you're alone nobody can tell you nothing you have two piece of papers you have to be some money yeah whatever you have two piece of what but the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof all glory to God so you will have nothing or glory to God what you think you have you

Heaven is open [Applause] make me [Applause] I don't know vanity fruitlessness profitlessness Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah this heart this thing called This Heart a pure heart you hear what Jeremiah 17 9 10 say the heart is deceitful perfectly Wicked it somebody can't trust your own heart yeah you could save this one look what she do and look what he do and look what he do and he do what you don't know what you're going to do the Bible said the heart that same hat in that hat wickedness [Applause] you don't have to say Amen you know it's still the truth because this is the word God don't lie if God said a heart Wicked it Wicked that's why you say a new heart I will give you [Applause] did you hear that he said a new heart I will give you [Applause] Glory Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so everything Clean Hands and pure heart I wonder how much going up that hill yeah [Applause] who who gonna climb it we're going to ascend onto this hill of the lord it's not my Hill it's not something hell it's not some problem no it's the hill of the Lord and I believe this morning a voice is calling come up here I believe our voice is coming not the Archangel The Voice [Applause] cannot believe us Hallelujah for Glory to God God will separate those who are called from those who are chosen or give the Lord some Praises here hallelujah you will be seated Jeremiah 7 9 and 10 says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it but the Lord sets the heart I tried the Rings even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doing and when he was going on mentioned about the pope and all what the pope is doing people don't think he will do it and he will begin my heart of a beast and in the Bible had a man who when the prophet prophesied all the wickedness he will do he deny it but that is exactly what he went and do because them things inside the heart is not by going into the man defiled man is what must come out of the man is what must come out your system hold glory to whatever the Bible says there's a man thinking his heart so he is also is he you could get a transformation today you can be there with a different beat than your soul in your spirit in your heart in your mind [Applause] you shall ascend into the hill of the Lord Oh Glory to God this is a kind of difficult message but if I know I preach on it I I had no contact so get around it but we're going to be here because this is what uh brought upon my heart this is the first time I learned by heart my God I could have repeat this time from first one straight down the whole time the Earth is the Lord the fullness that rubbed the world and all that do you know any Psalm At All by her I don't mind my early Christian experience this was the first Psalm I gotta speak the whole entire Sound by heart I know I'm preaching on it foreign into the hill of the Lord this scripture can be applied to all ages but has a special place in this hour of adoption and manifestation of the sons of God Hallelujah God there is no holy holy it's a holy God on the hill there is no Holy Mountain it's a holy God on the mountain makes the mountain holy whenever God come along in our place he said take off thy shoes for the place that he was standing is Holy Ground or give the Lord a shout whenever God comes down wherever he comes down that place becomes holy Oh Glory of God hallelujah Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there has always been a Holy Hill a mountain where God met and dealt with man foreign landed and saw the rainbow Abraham was to sacrificed his son on Mount Moriah monk Sinai is where Abe Moses received the Ten Commandments guys when Moses saw the Promised Land Mount Carmel is where Elijah called on fire montransfiguration is where the voice said hey him there is always a hill or a mountain that we have to go and we have to climb a place where Man meets God who shall Ascend unto the hill of the Lord who shall stand foreign [Applause] [Music] churches that's why the prophets that I did not come to build another denomination I came to bring individuals into the statue of a perfect man that day can become a Powerhouse [Applause] a Powerhouse [Applause] remember season when you become a pause you don't plug into nobody sounds sustaining effervescent you let Artisan well he said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly out of his inner being out of his heart out of his life will flow rivers rivers rivers rivers of Living Water not dead water Living Water [Applause] who shall ascend into this he'll love the Lord so the object of the message is not to say my church your church today no no no when the fire came down 1933 when but Obama was baptized in the back of our River and the pillar fire came down and the voice broke out he said as John the Baptist was sent over on my first coming you have a message that would for run my second coming so we are preparing for the coming of the Lord I don't know what you're preparing for oh but the coming of the Lord he is coming let's continue something that I put down here [Applause] it seems you don't have to live anything anymore in this message life is no longer required all you need is to show a book you believe a prophet you believe message you believe Dr live anything just believe the message just believe the doctor it's no different than being a Catholic or a baptism Methodist there's nobody different than having a Watchtower magazine with this I'm a Catholic I'm a baptism here the ring to Bell I'm Adventist I keep this sabbath so you see all them have the doctrine Jesus meant that he met people with Doctrine Pharisees scribes these scenes statutes all of them go to take John and don't call him zechariah's just call him John ceremony willingness scripture the voice of one crying the willingness so Johnny willingness nobody know why he likes willingness nobody knows what he's doing there all of a sudden he step out just like that after 30 years he come out repent just like a madman camel skin talking [Music] raw eating locusts and honey and why look at my free bed for the kingdom of God is at hand but churches get so settled now there is nothing there everybody just cool everybody come there was no innocence there's no end there's no desperation people's plot for lazy dead just doing what they normally do keeping the Commandments of men that's what Jesus found foreign [Music] hands often until they have a question about why Jesus disciples are so radical and so opposite to what we know in this message of Moses for all these years and we find their behaviors a little different and Jesus had to hit them hard he said you think what Outside the Fire in a man coming inside you washing pots and pans and doing this and the elders doing that and everybody mentioned doing this but the disciple is doing something completely different he says what comes out of the heart what comes out of the man hat so you can be praising and shouting but praise God you're a devil inside a deer that's why he said no shout wait listen live as high as your show you want to shout to hit the roof live that high if you tell him that high just hold him hold it down hold here man don't know don't go too loud no just keep it low [Applause] let me see but there must be an individual the individual or people or church must be ready Amen to go up that Holy Hill I want to see it good Holy Hill an Ascent of the righteous those with Clean Hands and pure heart few will Ascend to the hill of the Lord hands are what we do heart is what God sees you can have a clean hand you could have a clean appearance you could wear a dress long and don't cut your hair that is the Clean Hands and the clean path but you have to be corrupt thank you underneath that long dress underneath [Music] I hope you let me preach this morning because

mind having the understanding Darkness being alienated from the life of God to the ignorance that is in them because of the planets of the heart who being passed feeling have given themselves over to Las Vegas to work all on Clements with greediness but you have not swollen Christ so if be you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful loss and that word conversation I want to get it for you you said strip yourselves of your former nature put off and discard your whole

able to give to those in need it's more blessed to give than to receive if they don't have you can't give if it don't work you don't get in order to give you said one to be a giver that means you want

you give the more God gives you you become a channel a pipe a flow of God's blessing Friday open up and they keep giving and they're giving and they're giving that's why you have to go the extra mile

hell or give the Lord a shout foreign [Applause] and grieve not the Holy Spirit do not offend the facts or sadden him by whom you were sealed or marked this is a growth and a place to come into to get into the place of of you're wanting to please God so much you don't want the Holy Spirit to be affected some people some people the Holy Spirit can't affect them because they have they know when they're the Holy Spirit make a powerful statement he said when the spirit leaves some people would even miss it because they never knew what it was this spirit is what brings conviction to your heart if you feel convicted today you are blessed you are blessed you're feeling bad you're feeling conflicted in your heart you want to get God gave you a clean heart your God want to straighten out your

bitterness and indignation and wrath and passion and reach and bad temper and resentment and anger and animosity and quarreling and brawling and climate convention and slander he was speaking abusive or Blasphemous language be banished from you with all malice spiked ill will and pieces of any kind become useful and helpful and kind to one another tender-heartedly compassionate understanding loving hearted forgiving one another readily and freely as God and Christ forgive you oh praise God Matthew 5 8 let's send it appear in heart for they shall see God oh my hallelujah praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't stick on the virtues you can't stick on these feathers it has to come from inside out by the power of the holy spirit so what has to work on you is a work of God not a work of man so I am preaching through you but the Holy Spirit have to operate the word to you by giving you Revelation and breaking upon your life he could do it here no he could do it here on your way home or you could do it when you get home you can do it when you're on the way to the job but there's the Holy Spirit upon your life all right this one is it has been the holy spirit that made the Ephesus Church it was the Holy Spirit the Smyrna Church is the Holy Spirit to do all of that do you believe that I'm gonna wrap up my time Hallelujah there's no watch when in the individuals these virtues and things and knowledge that is added to Faith then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit seems it together there is the Battle of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in Christ then you become one and then that day you shall no arm in the Father the father and me and you you and me then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now and then they are Vindicated and pleased when that time comes takes place they become Vindicated sons and Vindicated daughters listen this watch the two spirits will be so close in the last days they'll be very seized very elected the people can so live people can live clean listen holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers Liars gamblers they can live above that and still not with it this is the age of Life a personal life of Christ so I like how he's bringing it because it doesn't put no grounds for you to sit down and sit back and relax it doesn't have that it have a pushing and oppression into this glorious kingdom of God or do you believe that Hallelujah now the second work of Hope sanctification the word means the clean and set aside for service well notice when the unclean Spirit going from a man he walks in dry places and it's clean it's pure and everything else and then when that demon come back and see the house clean it go on and gets seven other Devils worse than the first one to badge into the house and the man condition is worse than the first at first he had one demon now we have seven plus one no words will never take the pit for our Salvation works we fade already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of the same life as a fruit unto God I believe in good works even Mr man is not saved he ought to do good works do the best he can what a horribleness sight of God for a man to do evil works and then see that they are doing the will of God that is what the bishop and popes and hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing and maiming and doing all man of evil in the name of the Lord and that is why why Gamble the people are getting into their life at the white Throne judgment in the second Resurrection are people that did it by bright nice and true divide with respect because it was the bride and they said but you say when did you do that when when when they asked when you say you when I was sick you positioned me as you had done the leads to this one you've done nothing to me why gamble treat people nice all people I don't care if they Jehovah Witness the Baptist they may message they really succeed I'm still no steal they'll stop believing the message treat them nice treat them right you don't know when gonna flip them over turn them around you don't know when salt turn into Paul you don't know [Applause] treat everybody good let God be the judge if your men if your enemy hungry feed him if your enemy turns to give him drink [Applause] don't say Richie dead no give him treat him nice hallelujah praise God I know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service that is the right place for it because without love all works are not accepted that his hand is going again you're doing this you're doing this you're doing this you're doing this for the church it's a business [Music] yes hands going shooting this is treating you doing this you know why they ask me to ask somebody else to do it yes behind it [Music] you have no you want to get you know Hallelujah with your body woman the woman who your husband come home and your husband come home and Friends Day and and she wants to bring food they let it fall in a grown glass falling and whatnot and she's singing and singing and singing and thinking afterwards I see you see you see I tell you she's a Christian try that no no you break him and that's the last time you first come back in the house because they will know verbally and by manifestation not to come back in that house this is where we had to get away from all that behavior you just behave right but we say all I'm sisters one husband and one boyfriend everything else water Elise and make a prayer Lord anytime they're drinking water bring water and feed my caramel and get me water to drink and and help me let that be the girl for my Isaac is plenty scissors all them pretty all them nice all them looking good all them Hands Clean but he don't know the heart so the prayer addressing the heart [Music] because it takes a certain heart to have the kind of compassion and entry to treat that man right who is a servant of Isaac now here come with big bangers and bees and all kinds of things like that everybody know he's a rich man so I wanna I wanna be that man right he looking ordinary my normal like a traveler and he there you know nothing and he's just waiting there this is the past worship up and down yeah see that is why people don't understand the power of relationship they live in such a self-centered Island World they don't know that person connected to this person contacted this person who could help you and do something and bless you and open a door for you so because of your bad attitude you don't want this person your blood Catholic this person and because your black can't take this person this person that no this person can get to you so all your remainment is your own person and you're on your own all glory to God but this world is not like that hallelujah praise God hallelujah all who passed the man by all who the sister
