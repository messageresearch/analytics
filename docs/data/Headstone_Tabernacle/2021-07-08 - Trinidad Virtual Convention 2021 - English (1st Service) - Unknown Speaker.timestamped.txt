[3:51] on behalf of the headstone tabernacle in
[3:54] trinidad and tobago
[3:56] we'd like to welcome you to our virtual
[3:59] convention 2021
[4:01] the dispensation of another ephesians
[4:07] this year we are going to experience
[4:09] four powerful days
[4:11] with ministers
[4:13] creators
[4:14] singers and worshippers from all around
[4:17] the world
[4:18] we stand on the expectation to have a
[4:20] glorious time in the lord may god richly
[4:23] bless you as you worship with us
[4:26] [Music]
[4:39] [Music]
[4:50] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[4:52] will of god to the saints which are at
[4:54] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[4:56] jesus
[4:57] grace be to you and peace from god our
[5:00] father and from the lord jesus christ
[5:03] blessed be the god and father of our
[5:05] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[5:06] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[5:08] places in christ
[5:10] according as he has chosen us in him
[5:12] before the foundation of the world that
[5:14] we should be holy and without blame
[5:16] before him in love
[5:18] having predestinated us unto the
[5:20] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[5:22] himself according to the good pleasure
[5:24] of his will to the praise of the glory
[5:27] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[5:29] accepted in the beloved
[5:31] in whom we have redemption through his
[5:33] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[5:36] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[5:38] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[5:40] and prudence having made known unto us
[5:42] the mystery of his will according to his
[5:44] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[5:46] himself
[5:49] but we're promised according to
[5:51] revelations 10 and according to malachi
[5:53] 4 and saint luke 22 17 and so forth that
[5:56] there is got to come
[5:59] on ephesians to this
[6:01] there is promise to friends
[6:03] there must come an ephesians
[6:07] that these
[6:09] seven full mysteries of the word of god
[6:12] must be unfolded
[6:14] and it's in the ladies and age that this
[6:17] takes place
[6:19] believe that we're
[6:21] we're there
[6:22] i believe we're right in the shadows of
[6:25] the coming of the son of god
[6:28] [Music]
[6:29] and at joshua
[6:32] just before
[6:33] uh the ephesians uh raised up so did
[6:36] john the baptist raise up just before
[6:39] the next ephesians
[6:40] and we're promised
[6:42] a another
[6:44] another uh ephesians
[6:46] is predicted here in the scripture
[6:48] therefore i think that we are living in
[6:52] the ephesians again
[6:55] back again
[6:56] to we are promised that what was left
[6:59] off doing over seven ages now you cannot
[7:03] add nothing to the book or take nothing
[7:04] from it revelations 22 18 says so
[7:07] whoever will add one word
[7:10] or take one word this part will be taken
[7:12] from the book of life now we cannot add
[7:15] or take so therefore we know that luther
[7:18] could not get to it west end and so
[7:20] forth the reformers knocked penny calvin
[7:22] on down so forth they didn't get it all
[7:24] but what they had was the gospel truth
[7:27] but now in the last days we are given
[7:29] the understanding by the word that we
[7:32] are going to understand it because is
[7:34] there a common ephesian age to it
[7:43] [Music]
[7:50] god bless you saints and believers
[7:52] around the world
[7:54] i want to read a scripture from
[7:56] first samuel chapter 3 verse 1
[8:00] and it reads and the child samuel
[8:03] ministered unto the lord before eli
[8:06] and the word of the lord was precious
[8:08] in those days
[8:10] there was no open vision
[8:14] and
[8:17] but abraham talk about what a vision is
[8:19] then it's the direct word of the lord
[8:23] and we believe
[8:24] we have the direct word of the lord from
[8:26] our 20th century prophet
[8:28] that identify
[8:30] this big drama
[8:32] of the church
[8:33] coming to this dispensation
[8:36] of ephesians i want to share something
[8:38] with you
[8:39] he says
[8:40] so luta preached justification he let it
[8:42] run awhile because he didn't live long
[8:44] enough they organized the church luther
[8:47] never organized it after luther when the
[8:49] resurrection fought an afflue wesley
[8:51] they got the wesleyan church and after
[8:54] that come john smith the baptist
[8:56] alexander campbell and so forth but the
[8:58] men
[8:59] the reformers didn't live long enough to
[9:01] get it all together
[9:03] so you could see clearly
[9:05] there was something to get together
[9:07] because it was lost
[9:09] so this is what he said though so
[9:11] a lot of loose ends left like when they
[9:14] did it for instance the world of baptism
[9:16] that john smith brought back
[9:17] an immersion but using titles many of
[9:20] those things was left loose but then
[9:23] when we come to the end here we go the
[9:26] last message is supposed to straighten
[9:28] that all up
[9:30] to bring these things to one fate
[9:33] one lord
[9:34] one baptism see
[9:36] so what he is saying
[9:38] everything supposed to straighten it up
[9:40] to bring it to one lord one fate one
[9:43] baptism
[9:44] what is it
[9:45] another ephesians
[9:47] and
[9:48] he was speaking about a disability line
[9:51] and not knowing nothing about you
[9:54] not even knowing that's a strange man
[9:56] that come here it will absolutely be a
[9:59] paradox something done
[10:01] something you ought not to have done or
[10:04] something you should have done
[10:06] it would have to be a paradox because
[10:08] there's no way anybody to know that
[10:10] outside of the revelation of the unseen
[10:13] that's right
[10:14] and he will do that for you between you
[10:16] and i
[10:17] so that the audience
[10:19] not a show
[10:21] but they might see the ephesus is here
[10:24] and that this is the thing
[10:27] that bridges between denomination and
[10:29] glory land
[10:31] so this is what he says here
[10:32] not for sure but to see that the ephesus
[10:36] is here
[10:37] and this is the thing
[10:39] that bridges between the nomination and
[10:42] glory land he promised it
[10:45] so ephesians
[10:46] is the bridge that bridges between
[10:48] denomination and glory land so here we
[10:51] are at we see nations breaking israel
[10:54] awakening the signs that this bible
[10:56] foretold for this day we see the
[10:58] mechanical things taking place
[11:00] now the spirit here we go the dynamics
[11:03] of that promised word
[11:04] to get into his church and drive them to
[11:08] calvary yonder unto the rapture so it's
[11:10] not we going from word to the rapture
[11:13] know the spirit the dynamics of what
[11:16] what was promised the promised word to
[11:18] get into the church and drive them with
[11:20] the cavalry under and there we are the
[11:23] promised word is what another ephesians
[11:26] so this morning today it's a privilege
[11:29] and blessing for me
[11:30] uh to introduce and to have all these
[11:33] ministers both greeting and print
[11:35] ministers preaching the word and if you
[11:37] notice they're not pointing to
[11:39] themselves or to the group or ministry
[11:42] they're pointing the people to the
[11:43] promised land the kingdom
[11:46] the inheritance another ephesians by way
[11:49] of calvary
[11:51] and jordan and debt itself so before we
[11:54] begin we'd like to introduce you with
[11:57] [Music]
[12:08] greetings the lord richie bless you
[12:12] i greet
[12:13] you in the lovely name of our lord and
[12:15] savior jesus christ
[12:17] both your local
[12:19] and international audience
[12:22] this is pastor albert green from
[12:24] bethlehem tabernacle trinidad and tobago
[12:27] appreciating the invitation
[12:30] from our precious brother theo
[12:32] ovid
[12:33] uh
[12:34] to bring greetings
[12:36] to trinidad virtual convention
[12:40] the inspiration
[12:42] the dispensation
[12:44] of another ephesian
[12:47] a careful look
[12:49] at the
[12:50] quotation supporting the inspiration
[12:54] another
[12:56] another is described as one
[12:59] or more of the same
[13:03] another
[13:05] speaks are very similar to
[13:09] the quotation further carries us
[13:12] tells us of an ephesian again
[13:16] and again is described as another time
[13:21] or
[13:22] once more
[13:25] it is therefore important of us
[13:28] to look
[13:30] at the ephesians
[13:33] the very ephesians that give rise
[13:36] to the inspiration
[13:38] that strike our precious minister and
[13:40] servant
[13:42] that quotation of an inspiration
[13:46] again that quotation of another ephesian
[13:52] it beholds us to look at that ephesians
[13:56] that gives rise to the thought this
[13:59] morning
[14:01] or wherever you are what hour of the day
[14:03] it is
[14:05] the ephesians
[14:07] were a solid gospel church
[14:12] the ephesians
[14:13] were at church in order
[14:18] the ephesians were not babies
[14:23] they were grown-ups
[14:27] the ephesian
[14:28] church was a church that was just 12 in
[14:33] number
[14:35] yet
[14:36] there is no greater record
[14:39] to surpass
[14:41] the ephesian church
[14:43] that is spoken of in the bible
[14:46] it beholds us to conclude
[14:50] how much was done
[14:52] with 12
[14:53] completely
[14:55] surrendered
[14:56] what could be done
[14:58] today with us
[15:01] this is the group
[15:05] the apostle paul
[15:08] in his address
[15:11] a group
[15:12] that had certain characteristics
[15:18] a group
[15:20] that the apostle paul
[15:22] had no trouble
[15:24] with a group
[15:27] that never had to be put in order
[15:32] it beholds us to look and see
[15:37] are we
[15:38] that group
[15:41] god's prophet asked a question
[15:45] or
[15:46] draws
[15:47] in the question and answers on the seals
[15:50] to something that we need to take note
[15:52] of
[15:55] it tells us here
[15:58] we ought to live above the sort here
[16:03] and all this age now
[16:06] we are back into something now that
[16:09] god's revealing the hidden mysteries
[16:13] that has been put
[16:15] on the book
[16:16] before the foundation of the world
[16:20] and those who have obeyed in these small
[16:24] things
[16:26] amen
[16:27] will catch in these other things
[16:31] and if they haven't it will go over the
[16:33] top of your head
[16:35] as far as the east
[16:37] is from the west
[16:40] that are with that group
[16:43] amen are we that group
[16:47] why are we still fighting with the
[16:49] common things
[16:51] are we still having a fight with the
[16:54] carnal things
[16:56] you know it beholds us to
[16:58] get a glimpse this morning
[17:01] what is this message all about
[17:05] you know
[17:06] is the message just baptism in the name
[17:09] of our lord jesus christ
[17:12] but that's acts 238
[17:15] that's written right in the script here
[17:18] as god's prophet tells us you don't need
[17:22] a revelation amen on water baptism
[17:26] it's right there steering you in the
[17:29] face
[17:30] so you know is this message
[17:34] just
[17:35] a mod of dress
[17:38] amen is it just that
[17:41] is it wearing garments
[17:44] put not wearing garments putting into a
[17:46] man or a woman
[17:49] do we need a revelation for those things
[17:52] those things are staring us
[17:55] in the face
[17:57] so this ephesian group since
[18:01] this is
[18:02] a group by the grace of the lord
[18:05] amen this is the group by the grace of
[18:07] the lord
[18:08] it's not like cain
[18:10] you see because cain had a knowledge of
[18:13] all these scriptures he had on our
[18:15] knowledge from the lord about what is
[18:18] the right thing to do
[18:19] and still he couldn't do it
[18:22] so we gotta look and and search
[18:25] ourselves to see if we are really that
[18:28] ephesian group
[18:30] the group
[18:31] for which amen the closed book has
[18:35] become
[18:36] an open book
[18:39] so we see here
[18:41] amen the apostle paul
[18:45] in speaking to that division
[18:48] as we look for another ephesians
[18:51] in speaking to that ephesians
[18:55] those
[18:56] things that are called
[19:00] saints that are preserved
[19:03] sins that are set aside
[19:08] here
[19:09] the speaking was not to unbelievers
[19:14] for we know of the truth
[19:16] the the words
[19:18] of this message cannot be quickened
[19:21] in an unbeliever's heart
[19:25] so we gotta understand when we're
[19:27] looking for another ephesian
[19:29] amen courts
[19:31] we can call them all
[19:33] they are not for professors
[19:37] but they are for possessors
[19:40] they are not for babies
[19:43] but they are for those
[19:45] who are meant to eat meat
[19:49] look at the message
[19:51] paradox
[19:52] paragraph
[19:53] 67
[19:56] and god's prophet is showing us here
[19:58] from the inspiration
[20:01] there has got to be
[20:05] and ephesians also
[20:08] of this journey
[20:10] there's got to be an ephesians also of
[20:13] this journey
[20:15] just as there was of other journeys
[20:18] there has to come an ephesians
[20:21] an ephesians ephesus and ephesians of
[20:26] this journey
[20:28] we want to trust god this morning today
[20:32] wherever we are as we look at another
[20:36] ephesian
[20:37] as we look at an ephesian again
[20:40] as we look at these thoughts that are
[20:43] dedicated to the believer
[20:46] here it was these are people were told
[20:49] who they were before the foundation of
[20:51] the world
[20:53] this is the people
[20:55] was told what god did for them before
[20:58] the foundation of the world
[21:01] this was the people that paul spoke
[21:04] the great things too
[21:07] paul spoke to them
[21:09] the great mysteries
[21:11] of predestination of eternal security
[21:14] of unconditional covenant
[21:16] how god saw you in glory
[21:19] before the foundation of the world
[21:22] this is what is set aside
[21:25] for the overcoming
[21:27] ones
[21:29] so this morning
[21:31] as you look
[21:33] today
[21:35] whatever we are in the time zone
[21:38] the inspiration
[21:41] another efficient
[21:44] the inspiration
[21:46] and ephesians again
[21:49] because prophet tells us
[21:53] it is great
[21:55] when people can be taught
[21:58] the deeper things
[22:01] it is great
[22:03] when people can be taught
[22:06] the deeper things
[22:09] amen it is great
[22:11] it is great
[22:12] those of us who are looking for another
[22:14] efficient
[22:15] when people
[22:16] can be taught the real
[22:19] thing
[22:20] it is great when we can be taught the
[22:23] real thing
[22:24] it is great
[22:26] when the holy ghost
[22:28] can anchor great things in your heart
[22:32] as
[22:33] we come to a close
[22:36] we are stolen paradox paragraph 89
[22:39] we are promised according to revelation
[22:41] 10 and paul into malachi 4
[22:44] and so forth there's got to come an
[22:46] ephesians to this it's a promise
[22:49] there must come an ephesians that is
[22:52] sevenfold mysteries of god
[22:54] must be folded
[22:56] unfolded another ephesians friends
[22:59] and ephesians again
[23:02] amen it is for special people
[23:05] that god will share these truths too
[23:09] now remember
[23:11] as we close
[23:12] not another corinthians
[23:16] it's not another corinthians
[23:18] it is another ephesians
[23:21] and if another is used to refer to
[23:25] an additional person
[23:27] the same type
[23:29] the one already mentioned
[23:31] so it's not another corinthians
[23:34] corinthians as we know had to be spoken
[23:37] to us children
[23:38] corinthians cannot take orders
[23:41] the corinthians cannot be kept straight
[23:44] the corinthians were babies they had to
[23:46] be treated as babies
[23:48] they couldn't take the solid word
[23:52] remember another ephesians
[23:55] god bless you
[23:57] god bless the minister and servant so
[23:59] when you speak
[24:00] i was inspired to bring the word to the
[24:03] people

[58:57] eternity god bless you
[59:00] your inspiration was set
[59:04] the dispensation of another ephesians
[59:08] and as i said in my prayer
[59:11] may it become
[59:13] your personal
[59:15] dispensation
[59:17] in your life
[59:20] just to
[59:21] make a little background
[59:23] for the theme
[59:25] the dispensation of another ephesian
[59:28] we have to realize
[59:30] said when a church age ended
[59:34] a church dispensation like in the
[59:37] in the time of the law of moses
[59:42] and
[59:43] there was a change in the dispensation
[59:47] and we are again
[59:49] in another change of a dispensation
[59:52] and it is god's way
[59:55] to announce this change
[59:58] and he said he's sending a prophet he's
[1:00:00] doing nothing without sending a prophet
[1:00:03] and declare it
[1:00:05] to his people
[1:00:06] and he was sending a prophet in that
[1:00:08] time
[1:00:09] in the old time and the law changed
[1:00:12] to the new dispensation of jesus christ
[1:00:15] and
[1:00:16] this prophet
[1:00:18] john the baptist
[1:00:20] he
[1:00:22] introduced
[1:00:24] this new dispensation
[1:00:26] i call it
[1:00:28] the kingdom of god on earth
[1:00:30] and he said
[1:00:32] the kingdom of god is near it's coming
[1:00:35] near repent
[1:00:37] is the only way
[1:00:38] to to come before god
[1:00:40] with your heart
[1:00:42] open it
[1:00:44] and repent and if you don't have this
[1:00:47] i give you a
[1:00:48] clue how you can have it
[1:00:51] if you ask your heavenly father
[1:00:54] to give it to you an experience of dying
[1:00:57] at calorie
[1:00:59] this is the greatest experience that you
[1:01:02] can ever make
[1:01:04] because this finish
[1:01:06] your own life
[1:01:09] your own thoughts
[1:01:11] your imagination your own program
[1:01:15] see sometimes we
[1:01:17] we
[1:01:17] try to handle the promises
[1:01:20] with our own program
[1:01:23] the pharisees at that time say
[1:01:26] try to live the word
[1:01:29] but
[1:01:30] they had their program how to do it
[1:01:33] and when the whale of the temple
[1:01:36] rendon twain
[1:01:37] when jesus died at the cross
[1:01:40] then
[1:01:41] something new started
[1:01:44] a few days later he rose
[1:01:47] appeared to his disciples
[1:01:49] he went to heaven and he sent down the
[1:01:51] holy ghost
[1:01:53] on pentecost
[1:01:55] and then
[1:01:57] there it happened it started a new
[1:02:00] dispensation
[1:02:01] opened
[1:02:04] when the holy ghost came down
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:09] we call this new dispensation in
[1:02:12] ephesian
[1:02:14] ephesian
[1:02:16] the book of ephesians the letter to
[1:02:18] ephesians is not so much a letter to a
[1:02:21] local church as
[1:02:23] other letters in the new testament
[1:02:25] but this
[1:02:26] book
[1:02:27] that shows
[1:02:29] this dispensation that shows that
[1:02:31] dimension
[1:02:33] where jesus lives
[1:02:35] where
[1:02:36] we enter
[1:02:38] when we are dead to ourselves
[1:02:40] as we
[1:02:41] heard in the message from brother rename
[1:02:44] we cannot be born again without being
[1:02:46] dead before and so we have to have a
[1:02:49] personal experience of dying
[1:02:52] and it's very important and god gives it
[1:02:55] to us if we want that
[1:02:57] because it's his will
[1:02:59] and if we pray according to his will we
[1:03:01] have faith that he will give it to us
[1:03:04] so
[1:03:05] it's called an ephesian
[1:03:07] it's called the dispensation of the
[1:03:09] fullness of time
[1:03:10] it's written in ephesians chapter 1
[1:03:12] verse 10
[1:03:14] speaking about the dispensation
[1:03:16] of the fullness of time
[1:03:18] open for the newborn church
[1:03:21] and it actually was a love of god
[1:03:25] coming down in the hearts
[1:03:27] of the
[1:03:28] people god's own love
[1:03:32] where we were before the foundation of
[1:03:33] the world where i was
[1:03:35] maybe you can say it also in your heart
[1:03:37] you know it in your heart said you was
[1:03:39] there in his love
[1:03:41] then it makes it easy to receive it
[1:03:43] again
[1:03:44] that was blacked out through sin
[1:03:47] and through our birth
[1:03:49] and so we we actually killed the lamb
[1:03:53] we strangled it
[1:03:54] islam like nature
[1:03:56] and with our uh sexual
[1:03:59] born life when we when we came to this
[1:04:01] world speaking lies growing up
[1:04:04] and and uh
[1:04:06] it is actually the love of god
[1:04:08] coming down burning in its fullness
[1:04:13] and this this was holding
[1:04:16] about
[1:04:18] 25 years
[1:04:21] and it was holding in this ephesian
[1:04:23] church
[1:04:25] there was maybe only 12 12 brothers or
[1:04:28] what
[1:04:29] a small church
[1:04:31] but it was
[1:04:32] it was holding
[1:04:34] and then
[1:04:35] and then
[1:04:36] things crept in
[1:04:39] and paul
[1:04:40] writings with him
[1:04:42] because
[1:04:43] in revelation
[1:04:45] is told as
[1:04:46] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:04:48] says he have lost
[1:04:50] the first love
[1:04:54] and
[1:04:57] we are in a time now
[1:05:02] where
[1:05:03] we find back
[1:05:05] said first love
[1:05:13] i prophesy we will fall so in love
[1:05:17] with jesus
[1:05:19] said he can do us whatever he wants to
[1:05:22] do
[1:05:25] so
[1:05:26] this is
[1:05:27] because
[1:05:29] we are coming to this where ephesians
[1:05:31] started
[1:05:34] the fullness of his love
[1:05:37] his fullness of my savior's love
[1:05:41] the fullness of god's
[1:05:44] own love
[1:05:45] coming coming into a human being
[1:05:50] when he's going through the process at
[1:05:52] calvary
[1:05:54] that's the only way to receive it we
[1:05:56] cannot get it by our intellect
[1:05:58] we cannot
[1:06:00] get it by imagination
[1:06:03] it's not possible we cannot catch it
[1:06:06] but if we ask him
[1:06:08] in the name of jesus his son he will
[1:06:11] surely come and give it to us
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:17] so these believers
[1:06:19] realize their position in christ jesus
[1:06:21] it was direct and personal revelation
[1:06:28] the fountain of love say came from above
[1:06:30] before this world began this love
[1:06:33] became present tense
[1:06:36] there is no sin in that love
[1:06:38] no accusation
[1:06:40] no nothing no no shadow in it
[1:06:44] and this love
[1:06:46] is able
[1:06:49] to handle all things
[1:06:52] to forgive all things
[1:06:56] we are not able
[1:06:58] in our human life to handle all things
[1:07:02] when opposition comes
[1:07:04] we try to argue as humans
[1:07:06] and we fail
[1:07:09] but here in this ephesian time
[1:07:12] in this new ephesian time
[1:07:15] when when the love of god
[1:07:17] is abiding
[1:07:20] and brother brahm said it's since 33
[1:07:22] years
[1:07:23] he is in heavenly places and never came
[1:07:25] out
[1:07:26] it was abiding
[1:07:28] he made mistakes we are making mistakes
[1:07:31] but it was
[1:07:33] in the foundation abiding
[1:07:36] this is love
[1:07:37] and this love
[1:07:39] is able
[1:07:40] to handle all things
[1:07:44] it is such a blessing
[1:07:45] to be delivered
[1:07:48] from myself
[1:07:50] if i'm delivered for myself it's such a
[1:07:52] blessing
[1:07:54] if you are delivered from yourself
[1:07:56] and people don't know what to do they
[1:07:58] know it's a problem they have a problem
[1:08:02] but ask your heavenly father to give it
[1:08:04] to you and he will give it to you
[1:08:06] because you are in the will of god and
[1:08:08] the assurance comes upon you he gives it
[1:08:10] to me and you can testify to others what
[1:08:14] happened to you and how everything
[1:08:17] changed in your personal contact to the
[1:08:20] lord jesus
[1:08:22] many times we try to handle the promises
[1:08:26] as i said
[1:08:28] according to our program we fail
[1:08:31] we have to fit in god's program and only
[1:08:34] the word the holy spirit by the word
[1:08:36] knows it what his program is
[1:08:40] we have to find out
[1:08:42] where god's word
[1:08:44] belongs in our life
[1:08:47] the prophet said we are we full gospel
[1:08:49] people he called himself he said we full
[1:08:51] gospel people we believe the promises
[1:08:55] but it's not enough
[1:08:59] it's not enough
[1:09:01] love is even greater than faith
[1:09:04] yeah
[1:09:05] no the bible says the greatest is is
[1:09:08] love
[1:09:10] so
[1:09:11] we have to
[1:09:13] come into that realm into that kingdom
[1:09:17] in this in they said abiding place of
[1:09:21] glory
[1:09:22] we have to stay there day and night and
[1:09:26] god will give it to us
[1:09:28] and we will find
[1:09:30] where god's word belongs in our life not
[1:09:34] only to know the promise and thank you
[1:09:36] and i believe it
[1:09:39] my theme is and i must finish but i want
[1:09:43] to say this as a theme
[1:09:46] song in my life is goodness and mercy
[1:09:49] will follow me all of my life
[1:09:52] as a theme song
[1:09:54] and
[1:09:55] but if this psalm
[1:09:57] only would stay in my knowledge i know
[1:09:59] it's written in the bible and will
[1:10:01] follow all of my life no i have an
[1:10:03] experience with it
[1:10:05] i
[1:10:06] i connect it to my life so we have
[1:10:10] to connect the promises
[1:10:13] to our life
[1:10:15] and we can only do it
[1:10:18] when we die
[1:10:19] at calvary
[1:10:21] and have an experience of dying
[1:10:26] so
[1:10:27] it's a new land
[1:10:29] and we will hear
[1:10:31] maybe much from all the other ministers
[1:10:33] and i am expecting to
[1:10:36] to enter
[1:10:38] into their messages and be with them
[1:10:40] when they speak
[1:10:42] and it's a new land
[1:10:46] it's another ephesian
[1:10:49] you live in that promised land
[1:10:52] and and
[1:10:54] i call it the love of god
[1:10:56] and i let me finish with this
[1:11:00] jesus prayed
[1:11:02] in john 17 26 father
[1:11:05] i declared unto them thy name
[1:11:09] and will declare
[1:11:12] do you feel something
[1:11:15] then you know when you have an
[1:11:16] experience with the name of jesus
[1:11:20] when you say jesus in your heart
[1:11:24] something happens
[1:11:26] jesus said i declared
[1:11:29] your name and will declare
[1:11:32] why
[1:11:33] that the love
[1:11:34] wherewith thou has loved me
[1:11:38] may be in them
[1:11:40] and i
[1:11:41] in them
[1:11:43] this was the beginning
[1:11:46] of ephesians
[1:11:47] and it changed their lives

[1:23:14] we should be holy
[1:23:16] and without blame
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:30] but this is the message that he heard
[1:23:34] from the beginning

[1:23:46] jude 1 3
[1:23:49] beloved when i gave all diligence to

[1:24:03] earnestly
[1:24:04] contend
[1:24:06] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:24:10] unto the saints
[1:24:26] therefore
[1:24:27] from whence thou art fallen
[1:24:30] and repent
[1:24:32] and do
[1:24:33] the first works

[1:28:17] hallelujah
[1:28:18] and i understand
[1:28:20] the original ephesian church
[1:28:23] was just a few people
[1:28:25] i'm not mistaken about 16. it says so
[1:28:29] but they were so powerful
[1:28:31] amen and we we give god glory
[1:28:34] to aspire
[1:28:36] to be like them
[1:28:38] and therefore the title the original

[1:28:43] we have been speaking just last sunday
[1:28:47] about israel
[1:28:49] and how very soon
[1:28:51] we shall go back
[1:28:53] to that original tree
[1:28:56] and we see uh
[1:28:57] we see the nations are breaking
[1:29:01] and uh we see israel's awakening
[1:29:05] uh the the the things we have seen
[1:29:07] online
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:22] the taking
[1:29:29] [Music]

[1:29:43] the 144 000.
[1:29:46] there you are
[1:29:47] bring back
[1:29:49] the original tree
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:32] evidently something
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] had left their mind
[1:30:38] it's called amnesia
[1:30:41] he says they have forgotten something
[1:30:45] be careful you don't forget
[1:30:46] something who you are
[1:30:49] that the rapture won't be long
[1:30:51] don't forget something
[1:30:54] he told them
[1:30:55] to turn back in their minds
[1:30:59] to their point of origin
[1:31:03] and that's what i'm saying to you today
[1:31:05] go back to your point of origin
[1:31:08] god has predestinated you
[1:31:12] to be blameless
[1:31:14] before him in love where did you start
[1:31:18] don't leave that first love
[1:31:21] amen the origin
[1:31:23] of the first age
[1:31:25] was pentecost
[1:31:27] now they had fallen
[1:31:30] from it
[1:31:31] they had forgotten
[1:31:33] the glory
[1:31:35] and the wonder
[1:31:36] of it
[1:31:38] now it was time to go back
[1:31:41] in mind
[1:31:53] amen for me to live
[1:31:56] it's not success for me to live
[1:31:59] it's not just to to do things
[1:32:02] and to to to make money
[1:32:04] but for me to live
[1:32:06] is christ
[1:32:08] hallelujah
[1:32:09] for me to live
[1:32:10] the
[1:32:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:32:26] and i i i understand
[1:32:29] he said in gabriel's instructions
[1:32:32] that he will send elijah
[1:32:36] before that day comes
[1:32:38] at the end
[1:32:51] turn them back to the original
[1:32:55] that's what it's about
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:58] that's why he came
[1:32:59] to turn you back
[1:33:01] to get your focus
[1:33:04] on what the original was
[1:33:20] this one
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:34:30] to return
[1:34:44] to the place where i first received you
[1:34:48] oh lord take me back
[1:34:51] to the heart of worship
[1:34:53] when my worship comes from my heart
[1:34:56] and not just a church form
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:14] yeah
[1:35:15] and look it might not we we've said
[1:35:17] malachi 4.
[1:35:19] the elijah
[1:35:21] but yeah it might not just be one person
[1:35:25] but it will be a
[1:35:26] message the church
[1:35:29] the holy spirit
[1:35:31] in the church
[1:35:33] to swing
[1:35:35] that faith
[1:35:37] back to the original faith
[1:35:40] back to the rock
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:53] but we want to swing back that faith
[1:35:57] to the original faith
[1:35:59] that's my burden

[1:56:52] we shall never be a denomination
[1:57:22] that is the unveiling amen
[1:57:25] that is when things get unveiled

[1:57:30] is in the bride of jesus christ

[1:57:48] john the baptist
[1:57:50] raised up
[1:57:51] before the next episode
[1:57:54] and we are promised
[1:57:56] another ephesian
[1:57:59] another ephesian
[1:58:00] the original faith
[1:58:02] it's got to be here

[1:58:16] that what was left off
[1:58:32] message
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:54] those divine mysteries
[1:58:56] are reserved for the end time
[1:58:59] we understand those things
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:14] ephesians
[1:59:23] because we only have seven church ages
[1:59:25] we're not preaching eight church ages
[1:59:28] so we have to
[1:59:41] see
[1:59:42] it cannot be counted eight days you
[1:59:45] can't do it
[1:59:47] it cannot be counted
[1:59:49] because there's only
[1:59:51] seven days
[1:59:52] in the week
[1:59:54] count it anywhere you want to
[1:59:56] but
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:38] we can't
[2:01:03] musicians where are you raise your hand
[2:01:05] musicians
[2:01:06] where you're sitting
[2:01:07] you tell me
[2:01:08] can i say a
[2:01:11] b
[2:01:13] c
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:14] d
[2:01:16] e
[2:01:18] after two high
[2:01:20] f
[2:01:35] i've got to go back to the beginning
[2:01:38] i can sing a b c d e f g
[2:01:41] but then i i can't continue
[2:01:45] with i
[2:01:46] e
[2:01:47] a j h i can't do it i must go back to
[2:01:51] hey
[2:01:53] i must go back to the original
[2:01:56] if i don't
[2:01:57] then i'll be inventing new music
[2:02:00] i have to go back to me first
[2:02:08] amen this is the law of jubilee
[2:02:11] you have to go back to the beginning
[2:02:14] hallelujah
[2:02:15] after 50 years
[2:02:17] the year of jubilee came
[2:02:19] after the year of jubilee
[2:02:21] everything
[2:02:22] went back to his original
[2:02:25] beginning again
[2:02:26] all the slaves
[2:02:28] they went back to the original again
[2:02:44] in the jubilee
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:03:00] what a great feeling
[2:03:02] i'm here now
[2:03:04] but i'm free
[2:03:05] like i was 50 years ago
[2:03:08] now brought free
[2:03:09] praise be to god
[2:03:11] we don't travel back in time
[2:03:13] we are here now
[2:03:15] but we are free amen
[2:03:16] what can we say to these things
[2:03:18] amen god is with us
[2:03:21] amen all the slaves
[2:03:23] they went back to the original beginning
[2:03:26] they just stopped
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:41] what do we say to these things
[2:03:43] even if a man was homing in the field
[2:03:47] and the trumpet sounded
[2:03:48] he would throw down the hole
[2:03:51] he would say
[2:03:52] in 2021
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:04:08] on the ground he had to get off the
[2:04:10] ground
[2:04:11] that's all
[2:04:12] because the original
[2:04:15] it automatically automatically exposes
[2:04:18] the impersonator
[2:04:20] just like isaac
[2:04:22] automatically
[2:04:37] when you are the original
[2:04:39] you will expose everything
[2:04:42] because you are the original
[2:04:44] if a squatter was on the ground
[2:04:46] he had to get off
[2:04:48] that's all
[2:04:49] he got off the ground why
[2:05:04] who can
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:18] amen
[2:05:31] you can't add to the bible
[2:05:45] as it was years ago
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:59] god cannot make a decision today
[2:06:03] and make a better decision
[2:06:05] because his first decision
[2:06:08] is perfect
[2:06:09] his original decision
[2:06:11] is perfect
[2:06:13] you just have to go back there
[2:06:36] [Music]
[2:06:39] he says jesus
[2:06:41] he took the original five loaves
[2:06:44] and the two fishes
[2:06:46] he began to break them
[2:06:48] from the original
[2:06:50] he made bread
[2:06:52] is that correct
[2:06:54] and it fed 5 000 people
[2:06:56] is that right he said i got a fish
[2:06:59] give me a fish
[2:07:00] it was a fish
[2:07:02] to begin with
[2:07:03] and he took from that fish
[2:07:06] another fish
[2:07:07] and another fish
[2:07:09] and he fed 5 000.
[2:07:38] and it was there
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:08:05] that is what we are preaching there was
[2:08:08] nothing
[2:08:09] i tell you even if it looks ridiculous
[2:08:12] speak the word
[2:08:14] it will come into existence
[2:08:16] hallelujah just say the word
[2:08:19] hey man
[2:08:20] let it be there
[2:08:22] he says oh
[2:08:23] his word is infallible
[2:08:25] it has to be fulfilled
[2:08:28] listen to this
[2:08:29] i could tell you
[2:08:31] things
[2:08:32] that would shake you
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:09:28] and god drops the seed of this
[2:09:30] confession
[2:09:32] into the blood
[2:09:34] of his own blood
[2:09:36] and forgives that sin
[2:09:39] and he replaces
[2:09:42] in that man
[2:09:44] the original
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:10:12] he
[2:10:25] the creative power of god
[2:10:29] should be in the church
[2:10:31] amen you have nothing
[2:10:33] but you speak it
[2:10:34] that's the face we've got speaking
[2:10:36] conditions
[2:10:38] amen
[2:10:39] it breaks every wall of sin
[2:10:42] it breaks it down
[2:10:44] praise be to god
[2:10:45] now
[2:10:46] yes brother brad i'm talking
[2:10:48] amen in the message deep calls too deep
[2:10:52] if he can reveal
[2:10:54] what your
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:20] and that spirit knows
[2:11:36] and i don't
[2:12:04] that's what the purpose is
[2:12:06] amen so so that's what it's about
[2:12:09] it says that that's what the reason is
[2:12:15] to show
[2:12:16] there was a spirit
[2:12:18] here
[2:12:31] there is a spirit here that knows you
[2:12:35] man that's what you need to catch
[2:12:38] there's a spirit here
