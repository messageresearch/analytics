[25:49] verse 11 to 12.
[25:51] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[25:55] to 18 revelation 10 1 to 4
[25:59] and revelation 6 18 12
[26:04] to 17. so let's read isaiah 21
[26:07] 11 and 12. the burden of duma
[26:10] he called me to me out of seer watchman
[26:14] word of the night
[26:15] watchman what of the night the watchman
[26:18] said the morning comet
[26:19] and also the night if he will inquire
[26:23] acquire return come
[26:26] first thessalonians chapter 4 reading
[26:29] from verse 13
[26:30] from english scripture but i would not
[26:32] have you between ignorant brethren
[26:34] concerning them which are sleep that you
[26:36] sorrow not even
[26:38] as others which have no hope for if we
[26:40] believe that jesus died and rose again
[26:42] even so them also would sleep in jesus
[26:45] will god bring with him
[26:47] for this we say unto you by the word of
[26:49] the lord that we which are alive and
[26:51] remain
[26:52] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[26:53] prevent them which are asleep
[26:55] for the lord himself shall descend from
[26:58] heaven
[26:59] with a shout with the voice of the
[27:01] archangel
[27:02] with the trump of god and the dead in
[27:04] christ shall rise first
[27:06] then we which are alive and remain shall
[27:09] be caught up together with them in the
[27:10] clouds to meet the lord in the ear
[27:13] so shall ye ever be with the lord
[27:15] wherefore comfort one another
[27:17] with these words revelation chapter 10
[27:22] and i saw another mighty angel coming
[27:23] from heaven clawed with a cloud and a
[27:25] rainbow was upon his head his face
[27:27] was at the wooded sun his feet just
[27:29] spilled the fire
[27:30] and he had in his hand a little bit open
[27:33] he set his right foot upon the sea
[27:35] his left foot on the earth and cried
[27:37] with a load voice
[27:39] as when a lion roared and when he had
[27:41] crime seven thunders after their voices
[27:44] when the seven thunders had uttered the
[27:46] voices i was about to write
[27:48] i heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[27:50] me seal up those things with the seven
[27:52] thunders
[27:53] uttered and write them not we want to go
[27:57] to
[27:58] revelation chapter 6. i want to read
[28:01] from verse 12.
[28:04] and i beheld when he had opened the
[28:07] sixth
[28:08] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[28:12] and the sun became black as sucklet of
[28:14] here
[28:15] the moon became his blood and the stars
[28:18] of heaven fell into the earth
[28:20] eema's a fig tree casted on timely figs
[28:24] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[28:27] the heaven
[28:28] departed as a scroll when it is rolled
[28:31] together
[28:32] every mountain an island will move out
[28:34] of their places
[28:36] and the kings of the earth and the great
[28:38] men and the rich men
[28:40] and the chief captains and the mighty
[28:41] men and every bond man every
[28:44] free man hid themselves in dens and in
[28:46] the rocks
[28:48] of the mountains and set to the
[28:50] mountains and rocks fall on us
[28:52] and hide us from the feast of him that
[28:55] sitteth on the throne
[28:56] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[28:59] great day of his right is come
[29:01] who shall be able to stand may god bless
[29:04] his word you may be seated
[29:06] o praise the name of the lord of a title
[29:09] tonight
[29:10] the morning comet and also the night
[29:14] what was the question watchman what of
[29:16] the night
[29:17] but the answer came kind of strange the
[29:20] morning comet
[29:22] and also the night and that
[29:25] sixth seal of judgment is coming
[29:29] it's on its way oh praise god but we
[29:33] bless god
[29:33] today that christ has slipped down
[29:37] under the seventh seal to deliver and
[29:40] redeem
[29:41] this end time bride who praise god so
[29:44] for a message
[29:44] i think this is a token he was speaking
[29:47] about the animal life
[29:48] he couldn't come back upon a human being
[29:50] when the blood was shed
[29:52] and the blood is the chemistry of the
[29:54] life but the life is something different
[29:55] from the blood
[29:56] but the life is in the blood and the
[29:59] animal life could not come back upon the
[30:00] worshipper
[30:01] so all the lambs and the bulls and the
[30:03] goats and whatever they was offering
[30:05] that spirit life couldn't come back upon
[30:07] the worshipper
[30:08] but watch he said because it could not
[30:11] come upon
[30:12] it could not come upon a human being
[30:14] because the animal life doesn't have a
[30:15] soul
[30:16] the animal doesn't know he's naked he
[30:19] doesn't realize sin
[30:20] it knows none so therefore it's a living
[30:23] being but it's not a living soul
[30:25] therefore that animal life couldn't come
[30:27] back upon a human being
[30:28] because it didn't have a soul in that
[30:30] life or where there is life a blood a
[30:33] life
[30:33] and a soul in that life the soul is the
[30:37] nature of that life
[30:38] but this glorious place under this
[30:41] covenant there's a
[30:42] difference between the blood
[30:45] and the life the token
[30:49] for the believer today is the holy ghost
[30:53] let me say it again the token for the
[30:56] believer today
[30:58] is not i believe the message i believe
[31:00] but the banner am i going to church
[31:02] the token for the believer today
[31:05] is not like my pastor is is the holy
[31:08] ghost
[31:09] not blood chemistry but is the holy
[31:13] spirit of god
[31:15] that is the token and god requires
[31:18] of the church today and must
[31:22] god here we go must see this
[31:25] token he must see it in every one of us
[31:29] this has nothing to do with what the
[31:30] pastor see what the elders see what the
[31:32] deacons see
[31:33] what your neighbors see what your wives
[31:34] see god
[31:36] must see the token in every one of us
[31:40] therefore here we go as the evening
[31:43] shadows are appearing
[31:45] and the rat is ready to be poured out
[31:48] from on high
[31:50] upon the ungodly nations upon the
[31:53] ungodly believers
[31:55] and upon the professors
[31:58] without a possession upon these things
[32:03] i've tried to unfold myself live right
[32:06] among it
[32:07] to see where it is standing before i
[32:09] said these things
[32:10] no we are living in the shadows and the
[32:13] rat
[32:14] is ready to strike and god is requiring
[32:17] a token
[32:18] that you yourself have received this
[32:20] token the holy ghost
[32:21] it's the only way and the only sign that
[32:24] god will ever pass
[32:25] because it is the literal life
[32:28] of jesus christ return back
[32:31] into the believer i think this word
[32:34] quote and again
[32:35] because it is the literal life
[32:38] of jesus christ return back upon the
[32:41] believer
[32:42] oh my so therefore judgment is coming to
[32:44] professors
[32:46] without a possession claiming we believe
[32:48] and we have not received
[32:50] is not good enough you have to have
[32:51] possession they came out of egypt
[32:54] into a land that they could walk on and
[32:56] say this is my land
[32:58] it wasn't pointing at it it wasn't
[32:59] prophesying about it
[33:01] it was possessing it oh glory to god and
[33:04] you have to possess
[33:05] what you know is your own and how you
[33:07] could know is your own
[33:08] is when it's revealed to you and how
[33:11] it's revealed to you is from your father
[33:13] that is what jesus said not an
[33:15] understanding of it
[33:16] but a revelation of it understanding and
[33:18] revelation is two different things
[33:20] many people understand a lot of things
[33:22] but they haven't heard from heaven yet
[33:23] when you hear from heaven nobody could
[33:25] change that nobody could
[33:27] cancel that that is your father upon
[33:29] this rock i will build my church
[33:31] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[33:33] against it
[33:34] i believe in the grace of god but look
[33:36] no matter what
[33:38] your faith is you are not going to be
[33:41] judged by your
[33:42] faith you're going to be judged by your
[33:44] works and when you die
[33:46] debt does not change your spirit
[33:50] it only changes your dwelling place it
[33:53] only changes
[33:54] houses for you and if you die in your
[33:57] sins
[33:58] you go to a worse habitation than you
[34:00] are living in now
[34:02] if you die in christ you will be with
[34:04] christ for he is the way
[34:06] remember when you die that soul leaves
[34:09] you
[34:09] it never changes no sin death doesn't
[34:12] change the soul
[34:13] it doesn't change the spirit it doesn't
[34:15] change the soul
[34:17] it never watch it just changes the
[34:19] dwelling place
[34:20] it's still the same soul so if it isn't
[34:23] born again or a part of that eternal
[34:26] spirit of god
[34:27] it had a beginning and anything had a
[34:29] beginning had an
[34:30] ending and that's the reason god is the
[34:32] only thing that is eternal
[34:34] because being born again being an
[34:36] eternal life coming into your being
[34:38] oh praise the name of the lord death
[34:41] doesn't do nothing to a man
[34:42] but changes dwell in place it doesn't
[34:44] change your nature
[34:46] it doesn't change your fate it doesn't
[34:48] change nothing in you but your dwelling
[34:50] place
[34:50] so whatever way your nature is this
[34:52] morning if you are
[34:54] daughter of god's word you'll be a
[34:55] daughter over there and i don't care
[34:57] whole you are
[34:58] how you live how good you live it
[35:00] wouldn't change you one bit to die
[35:02] just your dwelling place and if you
[35:04] cannot accept the whole word of god
[35:07] the way it's written you wouldn't do it
[35:09] so no don't worry you won't be there
[35:11] oh glory to god you have got to accept
[35:14] it
[35:14] in its fullness in the power of its
[35:17] vindication and revelation of what it is
[35:20] then you are part of it and only his
[35:23] word
[35:23] that he'll raise up so he as he did his
[35:26] word
[35:27] as he did his word on the first easter
[35:30] morning only his word come forward
[35:32] oh praise and he was that's why i keep
[35:33] saying the rapture is in you
[35:35] oh glory to god what are you coming for
[35:36] is what is in you when the token is in
[35:38] you
[35:39] and that big super magnet pass it picks
[35:42] up what is magnetized to it and because
[35:44] your flesh is around that you go into
[35:46] but you have to have it inside of you
[35:48] you can't rub it on the outside
[35:50] nope inject it inside your head you have
[35:52] to have this thing inside of you
[35:54] oh could the lord broke somebody get
[35:56] some god praises
[35:57] so eve corrupted the whole human race
[36:00] by physical death how by rejecting the
[36:03] word
[36:04] and accepting something almost like it
[36:06] she caused all physical that because she
[36:08] left the true word
[36:09] and believed the true word all but a
[36:12] little bit one
[36:13] little disagreement with the full word
[36:16] of god
[36:17] caused every heartache every death
[36:19] everything has ever been on the earth
[36:21] eve done it
[36:22] she's the mother of death now you see
[36:24] where we are coming
[36:26] the mother of that notice she
[36:27] disbelieved what the word
[36:30] hallelujah isn't that right we know
[36:33] what the devil told her right god said
[36:35] and god didn't didn't mean that and so
[36:37] on
[36:37] and god said that settle but whatever
[36:39] god said that settles it
[36:41] and i think we have to come right back
[36:43] to that whatever god said
[36:44] that's it we don't need an
[36:46] interpretation of it
[36:47] let god manifest what he said there will
[36:50] be a revival
[36:51] there will be a revival there will be
[36:53] signs all the miracles there will be
[36:54] signs and more miracles there will be a
[36:56] fight for ministry there'll be a
[36:57] fightful ministry
[36:58] all glory to god we shall have a unity
[37:00] of the faith they're going to be united
[37:01] to defeat our hearts will return back to
[37:03] the faith of the fathers he sent a
[37:04] prophet to do that though our hearts
[37:05] will be turned back to the fate of the
[37:06] fathers
[37:07] whatever god said he will do
[37:11] amen that settles it it started with a
[37:14] little misconstruing of the word
[37:15] and the same thing it's the ending the
[37:18] same way notice
[37:19] that physical debt is the uniting of
[37:23] mother eve and satan
[37:25] together by disbelieving god's word
[37:28] they united and brought the product of
[37:31] debt
[37:31] debt is the product of united satan and
[37:35] eve together
[37:36] eve had the word satan is against the
[37:38] word and look almost
[37:40] 99 and 99 hundreds of it satan admitted
[37:44] was right
[37:44] so close the bible said in the last days
[37:46] that we see the very elective
[37:48] possible see how it come in how it

[46:07] none
[46:08] waiting for the manifestations plural
[46:11] of the sons of god when god will make
[46:14] himself
[46:15] known hallelujah so he's not talking
[46:18] about revelation
[46:19] he's not talking about unfolding
[46:21] mysteries he's not talking about
[46:22] teaching teaching teaching he's not
[46:24] talking about
[46:24] explanation when god will make himself
[46:27] known
[46:28] when they will stop sickness they will
[46:31] stop
[46:31] cancer they will stop diseases you think
[46:34] can say something
[46:35] the bible said there is common a time
[46:37] when men will rot right in their flesh
[46:40] and the buzzers would eat off carcasses
[46:42] before they even die
[46:44] cancer is a to take the words coming but
[46:46] remember
[46:47] that horrible thing was forbidden in
[46:48] that day to touch those that had the
[46:50] seal of god
[46:52] that is what we are striving for now to
[46:54] get in
[46:55] and be positionally placed into the
[46:57] kingdom of god
[46:58] before these horrible big strike oh
[47:01] we're getting the signs of it but
[47:02] they're coming
[47:03] night time it's coming oh hallelujah
[47:06] oh glory to god here's the plan of it we
[47:09] talk about the seals first seal second
[47:11] seal
[47:12] third seal the book was sealed the book
[47:14] is broken and now
[47:15] seal after seal being tore off isn't
[47:17] that right you said here's the plan of
[47:19] it
[47:19] the first thing happened announcement in
[47:21] heaven first what happens
[47:23] a seal is open or not what happened a
[47:25] mystery is full
[47:26] unfolded and when a mystery unfold the
[47:28] trumpet songs it declares war
[47:30] a plague falls a church is open what is
[47:33] the war part for
[47:34] the angel of the church catches the
[47:36] mystery of god not
[47:38] fully yet revealed and when he does he
[47:41] catches this mystery of god
[47:42] he goes forth to the people after the
[47:44] mystery has been given to him
[47:46] he goes for to the people what does he
[47:48] start out there he begins to proclaim
[47:50] that message
[47:50] what does it start a war so every word
[47:54] message declares a war starts the war
[47:57] hallelujah praise god that's a war a
[47:59] spiritual war
[48:01] and then he said now watch and then god
[48:04] takes his messenger
[48:05] with the elect of that age lays them
[48:07] away the sleep
[48:08] then he drops a plague upon them who
[48:10] rejected it temporary
[48:12] judgment and when that is over then it
[48:14] goes on did he nominate
[48:16] bring a denomination and start off with
[48:18] the man's work like wesley all the rest
[48:20] of them
[48:20] and all of a sudden they scrabble again
[48:22] and then another mystery unfold what
[48:23] happened another messenger arrives on
[48:25] the earth or church age
[48:26] and then he arrives the trumpet songs he
[48:29] declares war
[48:30] when that happens he is caught away and
[48:32] when he's laid away a plague falls
[48:34] destroy them spiritual death
[48:37] hits the church and she's gone that
[48:39] group
[48:40] now it's amazing that all these
[48:42] different groups that have been called
[48:44] out
[48:44] through the ages it started with god
[48:48] it started with a messenger it started
[48:50] with a word committed to people
[48:53] but once that age switches
[48:57] or a new word of message from god comes
[48:59] and they don't move with it
[49:01] it remains dead it changed the debt
[49:04] hallelujah my god so it goes to show you
[49:07] have to continue with the word
[49:09] you have to follow with the flow of the
[49:12] word you have to move with the pillar
[49:14] fire hallelujah and then he went on to
[49:17] say
[49:17] the last angel come to the last angel he
[49:19] has no certain mystery
[49:21] but he gathers all that had been lost in
[49:23] the mother ages all the truths
[49:25] that wasn't truly revealed yet as the
[49:27] revelation come
[49:28] he revealed those things if you want to
[49:31] read it
[49:32] read revelation 10 1 4 you will get it
[49:35] this alone
[49:36] the mysteries of god is the ministry of
[49:39] the seventh angel
[49:41] it have no man to come afterwards to
[49:43] reveal any new mystery the
[49:45] mysteries of god alone is the ministry
[49:48] of this seventh
[49:49] angel isn't that beautiful tonight
[49:52] hallelujah
[49:53] so now there are seven churches there
[49:55] are seven plagues seven seals
[49:57] seven trumpets a trumpet represent war
[49:59] and by god's help
[50:01] with the book of history i can prove to
[50:03] you
[50:04] that we are living at the seventh
[50:06] trumpet for the seventh plague
[50:08] and the seventh seal to be open and the
[50:11] seventh vial
[50:12] to be poured out when the six one song
[50:15] the ceiling away and he said the world
[50:17] war that six trumpets sounded exactly
[50:20] and the mystery was revealed in deer for
[50:22] the
[50:23] baptism of the holy ghost oh glory and
[50:26] the people then
[50:27] how the church did not move up so he's
[50:30] saying
[50:30] when god dropped the baptism of the holy
[50:34] ghost which is
[50:34] 1906 the people didn't move up what
[50:38] happened
[50:39] and those who moving refused to walk in

[53:35] glory to god hallelujah question
[53:38] i've got one i believe that christ comes
[53:40] forth to claim his
[53:41] material work now wait a minute will the
[53:43] foolish virgin be saved
[53:45] no whatever happens happens no after
[53:49] that time
[53:50] she's in a state she will have to go
[53:53] through
[53:53] the tribulation period we talk about
[53:55] people in this message
[53:58] i don't know what baptist and medicine
[54:00] panic i'm not talking mother
[54:02] i'm talking about virgins i talk about
[54:05] people that receive this word
[54:07] hallelujah here's it now she will have
[54:09] to go to the tribulation period
[54:11] and the reason of it is because she has
[54:14] rejected
[54:15] the atonement in its fullness she is a
[54:18] believer
[54:19] a professed believer but she will have
[54:21] to go to the tribulation
[54:23] hallelujah and the bible said the rest
[54:25] of them the dragons splitted water of
[54:27] the mouth
[54:27] what are all what that is and then you
[54:29] talk about never have them in a time
[54:31] that people have been hungry for the
[54:32] baptism of the holy ghost i wanted that
[54:34] will come back around what
[54:35] people recognize but listen to all these
[54:37] books all these tapes all this hearing
[54:38] and teaching
[54:39] and in church and whatnot and and things
[54:41] taking place and what i have now what i
[54:43] have could what do what i have
[54:45] could face the challenge of the hour
[54:46] what i have to get now oh glory to god
[54:49] maybe maybe we missed something maybe
[54:51] maybe we could have to go back for it
[54:53] maybe maybe maybe this oil is really
[54:54] real maybe you have to get an original
[54:57] experience like you have a little
[54:58] pentecost
[54:59] hallelujah i know they didn't talk much
[55:01] about it but maybe there is something to
[55:03] it
[55:03] yes there is something to it because the
[55:05] difference between the wise version and
[55:07] the foolish version the wise was wise
[55:09] enough to get extra oil the wise had the
[55:11] wisdom of revelation
[55:12] to god the wise had the wisdom of
[55:16] revelation
[55:17] to go get that oil oh give the lord some
[55:19] praises tonight
[55:20] not join your church and wake up to a
[55:22] pastor hallelujah but go get that oil

[55:27] get some oil
[55:28] hallelujah praise god hallelujah

[55:39] set seven thunders systems they built
[55:42] around systems systems
[55:43] the system don't have life it's the word
[55:46] have life
[55:48] and we challenge the system
[55:54] don't ever look to please man always
[55:57] look to please god
[55:58] that man ball cry criticize them laugh
[56:02] mock that is man but it's god you have
[56:05] to fear
[56:06] because when that place placed out a
[56:08] rock under the night time
[56:10] they will hide they say hiyos from the
[56:13] wrath of the lamb
[56:14] oh glory to god hallelujah hide us
[56:18] dense and caves that go behind them oh
[56:21] glory to god

[56:29] done
[56:30] who praised god if the church is saved
[56:33] even though she does not go in the
[56:35] rapture i believe you taught
[56:36] she must go through the tribulation for
[56:38] purifying but what about these that are
[56:40] dead how will they be preferred
[56:43] answer the bride don't need no
[56:45] purification
[56:47] she is already purified and they are
[56:49] dead back there
[56:50] these that go through they never receive
[56:52] the light that this church obtained has
[56:54] received
[56:55] they live under justification
[56:57] sanification and so forth
[56:58] they lifted the light that they had in a
[57:01] way they suffered and whatever they went
[57:03] through
[57:04] but now here we go in this
[57:07] rapturing time like this there will have
[57:10] to come a time
[57:12] now that this bride this is message
[57:15] people
[57:16] that reject the head part of the bride
[57:20] will have to suffer for her rejection
[57:24] hallelujah because the gospel wasn't
[57:26] made plain to them back there
[57:28] but it's been made plain to you today so
[57:31] you see it so plain
[57:32] you've done all had all these years and
[57:35] examples

[1:03:58] one could get that book
[1:04:00] all creation was gone she just simply

[1:04:32] paid the price of redemption
[1:04:34] every man was born of sex born in sexual
[1:04:36] desire he was in the original sin
[1:04:38] satan and eve so he could not do it
[1:04:41] there's nothing in him
[1:04:42] no holy pope no holy priest no holy
[1:04:45] doctr divinity

[1:11:46] this very image
[1:11:48] in the order in order to be united with
[1:11:51] him
[1:11:51] that's the purpose of the image god had
[1:11:53] bled him with something not like him
[1:11:55] that's why the dove and the lamb
[1:11:56] connects it has to be the same kind of
[1:11:58] nature
[1:11:59] that is him have the connection had to
[1:12:01] be kind of rough and gruff and carrying
[1:12:02] out with foolishness
[1:12:03] god not united with that it have to be a
[1:12:06] living fate
[1:12:07] living virtue living knowledge living
[1:12:09] temperance that's the logos
[1:12:14] all those virtues they will be
[1:12:18] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:12:21] the living god
[1:12:23] so when people reading text the text
[1:12:25] will be living
[1:12:27] the bride will be walking texts text
[1:12:30] made flesh
[1:12:32] hallelujah oh glory to god do you
[1:12:35] understand
[1:12:36] that now the bride will be the living
[1:12:38] text
[1:12:39] that's what jesus did you know you sit
[1:12:40] down for 18 years hearing them making
[1:12:42] all kind of fancy revelations then into
[1:12:43] petition
[1:12:44] and when it's time come fire take him
[1:12:47] power take him
[1:12:48] anointing hit him on the bank of the
[1:12:50] jordan river
[1:12:51] dove dropped upon him hallelujah then
[1:12:54] that dove led him into the wilderness
[1:12:56] to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of
[1:12:58] the flesh the power of life
[1:13:00] because god's pattern is that before god
[1:13:02] gave a man power
[1:13:04] and authority over others he has to have
[1:13:06] power over himself
[1:13:09] glory to god do i hear a shout
[1:13:12] everywhere let me say it against god's
[1:13:14] pattern
[1:13:15] it's before he gave a man power over
[1:13:18] others and other things
[1:13:19] he has to have power over himself
[1:13:22] if you can't conquer yourself who you
[1:13:24] want to conquer if they can't be in
[1:13:25] charge of yourself who you want to be in
[1:13:26] charge of that's the problem with
[1:13:27] governments
[1:13:28] and kings and prime ministers and
[1:13:29] presidents they can't control itself
[1:13:31] they want to
[1:13:31] mash up the country and control this one
[1:13:33] they have no temperament they don't have
[1:13:34] no life
[1:13:39] they will be the very manifestation of
[1:13:40] the word of the living god
[1:13:42] the nomination can never produce this
[1:13:44] they produce their creeds and dogmas and
[1:13:46] so on
[1:13:46] he said i believe on next one god is
[1:13:49] bearing record of his word
[1:13:50] we know that this is a day of salvation
[1:13:53] where god is calling
[1:13:54] men from the world from a life of sin on
[1:13:57] the life of service
[1:13:58] and in the day that god has poured out
[1:14:00] the spirit from on high
[1:14:02] great signs and wonders
[1:14:05] are to accompany the ministry of this
[1:14:08] day
[1:14:08] when the former and later reign are
[1:14:11] falling together
[1:14:12] what's supposed to happen great signs
[1:14:15] and wonders
[1:14:16] now the church god doesn't deal with the
[1:14:18] church as an organization
[1:14:20] he doesn't deal with the church of the
[1:14:21] group of people hallelujah he deal with
[1:14:23] the church as individuals
[1:14:25] each individual in the church that
[1:14:27] extracted message yet
[1:14:28] because ministers had them wronged up
[1:14:30] like if there's chickens in a barnyard
[1:14:32] and they're controlling the flock that
[1:14:34] is strike yet
[1:14:35] hallelujah the god is dealing not as a
[1:14:38] group
[1:14:38] but as individuals hallelujah so i am
[1:14:41] different from
[1:14:42] everybody else they can't connect me
[1:14:44] with anybody else
[1:14:45] hallelujah and god made me he eat your
[1:14:47] witty mole
[1:14:48] hallelujah praise god you are individual
[1:14:51] in god hallelujah praise god
[1:14:54] god doesn't deal with the church and
[1:14:56] organization he doesn't deal with the
[1:14:57] church of a group of people
[1:14:58] it's no secret here we go we all see it
[1:15:02] when a man proves and god loves him
[1:15:05] he takes him out somewhere to himself
[1:15:08] there in the front of angels he does
[1:15:11] something for him
[1:15:12] he lifts him up in the presence of god
[1:15:14] and gives him
[1:15:16] and fills him and sets him out that's
[1:15:18] the age
[1:15:19] we are living in oh glory to god same
[1:15:22] holy spirit that saved the lutherans and
[1:15:24] signed me by the methodist and battle of
[1:15:26] the pentecostal is now set in order the
[1:15:28] coming of the lord jesus
[1:15:29] will be so powerful that body will come
[1:15:31] into this group a church that will draw
[1:15:33] the rest of them from the grave there
[1:15:34] will be a resurrection
[1:15:36] that is what the holy ghost is for day
[1:15:39] without us not made perfect
[1:15:40] is that right final quote and i'm done
[1:15:42] tonight
[1:15:44] god is trying to place his church in
[1:15:46] position to manifest himself
[1:15:49] that's what his battle was all about all
[1:15:51] our minds and thoughts god can't take
[1:15:52] that in my thoughts and go to us it's
[1:15:54] not the same thoughts
[1:15:55] we'll have to knock that out god will
[1:15:57] give us experiences to flush us out
[1:15:59] pull it just out sometimes it's take 30
[1:16:00] years to make a man 30 years to grind
[1:16:03] things out
[1:16:03] like a grinder
[1:16:07] 30 years to get a man in shape for a six
[1:16:10] month ministry
