Corinthians chapter 6 this is 9 to 11 and then Romans chapter 8 verse 50 praise the Lord Amen thank you Jesus hallelujah Heavenly Father we pray bless your word as we read it now O Lord and bring divine revelation to our hearts at this time let's say people we ask it in your precious name Amen praise God 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 to 11 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God this 11 and such were some of you but ye are washed can we say men but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God can we say man tonight Prince called you over to Romans chapter 8 verse pity moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen lor bless well tonight we pray in Jesus name Amen you may be seated tonight so a few minutes a mandrill fort but I wanna share tonight is the pure virtuous sinless Bride of Christ amen praise God now whatever we do as Christians whatever we achieve can only be done through faith and faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you can we say amen amen so without faith is impossible to even please God amen and Cain was very religious he built altars he offered sacrifices he paints tides he went to church he did everything that any other religious man would do he was sincere but Cain locked revelation he lacked faith in God so he could not please God no matter how what he did or how hard he tried my revelation of the word which is God is the only thing that God honors can we say men tonight it's the only thing that will stand true revelation divine revelation amen and Jesus said upon this rock of Revelation I will build my church and the gates of hell can never prevail against it a man of Florida Gori man hallelujah Hell itself will come against you two hundred thousand thousand Devils are loosed against you a man but they are not going to prevail over you tonight hallelujah glory to God they can prevail tonight cannot prevail tonight because on Christ the solid rock I stand hallelujah can we say man tonight hallelujah so pray for divine revelation tonight he meant no matter what you do you pray for divine revelation amen praise God so 1st Corinthians 6 we read it these adult reside on us fornicators fruits of the flesh tires and rock biters whatever it is we were born into this world and given a human nature by our first parents through a natural birth can we say man and with this human nature our desires were to do the things of this world you don't have to teach the 300 how to tell lies amen it's just in him amen that's the human nature we come into this world speaking lies hallelujah so there's a law of nature within our members pushing us to do evil things oh god help us tonight a man hallelujah but inside of man there's a thirst a deep crying out for God can we say man tonight hallelujah so here's God's Word through a preacher and he accepts the Lord he gets saved but the old Connor Adamic nature is still there same nj9 hallelujah where bottom says from the message you approach to God polishing up join in church reading a lot of books don't mean that you're converted come on now hey man hallelujah your intellectual mental conception of who God is still does that make you a Christian just yet can we say man tonight hallelujah you might go to church often you might put your name on a book praise God you are still out of the line with God because that all no.13 nature of the world is telling you say man tonight hallelujah take a lamb feeding on grass and a pig eating slop if you take the pig and polish him up and reform him and perfume him and give him grass to eat within a short space of time you will run right back to his wallow and slop praise God amen right doctors always a man my the only way to get the pig to change permanently from eating slop to eating grass is to take out the pic nature hallelujah and then take the nature of the lamb and put it inside of the pig or chlorine of God tonight a man in other words the pig must get a change of nature can we say man Henry say man hallelujah so you'll come to church for years since yeah you be applied but still not a Christian the picnic is still in there amen Paul said when I want to do good evil is present with me deep down inside of me I delight in the law of God but my human nature is warring against the deep inside of me Paul cried out o wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this body of death amen and maybe tonight some brother some sisters crying out for deliverance amen don't let its night pass you by tonight Amen hallelujah hallelujah don't go into 20-19 in the same old condition tonight can you say Amen hallelujah you begin to speak to God desperately in your heart hallelujah praise God Amen yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah just like that Pig needed a change of nature soon as the signal Amen not all human nature must die and you must must must be born again can we say men tonight you must be born again hallelujah praise God Peter spent many years in church with Jesus even healing the sick and fellowship and with a bredrin but before Calvary Jesus said to Peter after you are converted then strengthen the Brethren my men you mean after all these years Peter was still not converted a man this is serious now a man hallelujah a man playing games are over tonight a man and the prophets had real conversion is when the Holy Ghost moves the old nature out on a new nature comes in which is a Holy Ghost itself praise God tonight hallelujah amen I ran a man is truly born of the Spirit of God he has eternal life amen praise God amen yes Lord hey man notice only when you have a personal contact with Christ that changes your heart and nature and all things are passed away and all things become new only then you are a Christian a man Henry's a man tonight a man brother the nature of the world I stirred I'd die a man not divorced and brought out at some occasion a man also a man but totally dead a man then you must be reunited with a divine nature can we say men tonight hallelujah how do we become partakers of the divine nature from the message' position of a believe in Christ parabrahma look at it Jesus was bruised wounded torn open on his side with a Roman spear what for in order that by the Holy Spirit we could be baptized and his body and become partakers of His divine nature can miss a man tonight hallelujah Loreena golly man how can you cheat and steal and lie and backslide and cross the line and everything else with the divine nature of Christ in you he says impossible amen let us sing for a minute amen impossible glory to God but all things after possibly no more wars and fussing and stewing and arguing and tempers Amen all those things are passed away behold all things become new a man can be say man hallelujah my and maybe tonight you're struggling with contrary desires from the message God making his promise he says if you want to change your desires you have to change your nature amen let me say it one more time if you want to change your desires you have to change your nature can we say man hallelujah amen he says if you want to be a Christian just ask Christ and you will take your own nature out and put a new nature in amen then you don't have to impersonate anything no more hallelujah can be saying man praise God praise God maybe that will help somebody tonight man glory but I want to get to something I want to talk to the real you tonight because you are not the real believer that all nature's just for the flesh it's what we inherited from our parents from the natural birth a man but every true believer and you are a true believer tonight say I am a true believer tonight one more time say I am a true believer tonight Amen praise God what since are you coming here tonight if you can't believe that you're a true believer me man my faith is revealed to you Amen hallelujah don't look at your flesh and your mistakes but deep down inside of you there is a seizure that God put in there before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a hallelujah God had already put that seed in you so give him praise tonight hallelujah thank you Jesus yes Lord amen amen amen yes Lord so don't let it devil tell you you

two totally separate words a man come on now a man hallelujah for example you heard that I got drunk and did some real evil things and he was seriously offended by what I did and you are angry with me then you approached me about it and I confess that I did it and I apologized then he said okay brother I forgive you and I'm so happy and grateful for your mercy and for your forgiveness you forgave me for the wrong that I did to you that's forgiveness amen but if ur and you approached me I told you that I was out of the country at the time I did not do it I don't know anything about it and you turn and say I forgive you brother Stephen I would say forgive me for what I never committed the offense I'm not guilty are you crazy or something if I did it then I'm guilty and you could forgive me

said my days I guessing many now soon I'll be 5200 cells from 1960 I said lord I want to be faithful I want to be true to the end around the world many nations many peoples colours races and many creeds and things see how they're mixed up and they all in different little fusses and frustrations when in those places there's many true children mixed up in all fluster issues and things but there are two children and their true seed in it crying out for a reality in this message through seed that will do real revival that are praying for something that come from the law Harlan Lee the Prophet said he knew it for fact something is coming forth from the law and there's true seed out there looking for revival prophecy a said he said many children women in these places or in the hybrid fielding that truly don't want to be there they think they're doing God's will he said but I pray thee father this morning the take away all doubts from my little group here today I repeated God take away all dirt out here tonight know and from the rules who be listening on the tapes of sword take away all a man-made creeds and as Jesus when he came the first time he found them teaching things that wasn't sold from the beginning from the beginning so while God made it pure and unadulterated but man had take God's Word and made it of none effect by teaching the Creed of man and father so it is now and at the ner of coming of Jesus again see he said just like a vine that the bank puts was a branch on that branch was a Pentecostal branch filled with the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders the fruits followed that branch isn't alright because it was up pure branch is now he said if that vine ever puts forth another branch it'll be the same kind of branch we know that father by nature itself we know that if it graph any fruit is pretending to into that vine it'll it by the vine see and we know that we can take an orange tree grow citrus fruits of different kinds 7:08 we can put lemons on it isn't that right I don't go true citrus fruits it'll grow grapefruit it'll grow any kind of other tangerine it'll run any other citrus fruit but if that tree brings forth its own branch again it'll be an orange he said Lord it would be like the first one was the property here is now he said and we believe that there is to be a church and these last days that will receive Pope for monitoring the world in this laude CH right here we're living there be another true church in it here's what he says it'll be a church that's called back to the original painting car it'll profit it'll be a church that I have Jesus Christ walking in it you mean that's gonna come a time when that same Jesus it's gonna be walking and fail in a church brother I want to see that kind of church I believe tonight we are walking into it right now 20:19 here we come a church with Jesus Christ walking in it talking in it reaching out in it healing the sick raising the dead on our travels Oh hallelujah that's the original church and we are going back to that tonight we are going back to that right now right now tonight we are earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the stage and if it was want to lever it will be deliver again if the signals heal then they will be healed now they've got to because it's the same Jesus doing the same things he did in the Apostles in the Bible we talk about heroes of faith we talk about Joseph Wright we talk about Joshua Wright we talk about a your honor Abraham and men who stood the Bible said they had like passions just like you and I but they were pointing their age and then leave something they manifested something they weren't super special they were human means but God visit to them in their day and their age and in that dispensation of time and what I'm trying to tell you tonight is what you look around and see normal people but all these people sitting here tonight are heroes of faith you ahem you right here our heroes effect standing in this lousy C&H and there's a promise over you to put for another original patch but the same size the same wonders with the same miracles same promise same holy ghosts same healing the sick same raising the dead same personal temples he is gonna be in you you are not gonna be sick forever you're not gonna be where if I ever when the revival comes brother a little sweet people off

on an expectation tonight for the supernatural to take all of your heart your soul and give you don't purge or the baptism of the Holy Ghost Oh keep raising I'm almost finished hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he says he oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost Carla - in a 28 but all the Telos ins failed to do in 3,000 years he waits the prophets had to wait until the anointing of the church really strikes home for that fateful little remnant after the toes of the chant Isis clothes oh he said God will anoint a church then he will anoint it he's gonna anoint you because hands was anointed because hands are so quicken and whatever he spoke was anointed when he touched the sick they were here for sure anointing was coming out of them coming out of his skin God was leaking out to them everywhere they went even Peter shadow we will be in here shadow I'm saying tonight that God's gonna have young people was gonna have Caleb's in this church on this island in

world back again one more quote and I'm finished you could play something softly he said put your name on a Lamb's Book of Life today by the blood of Lord Jesus Christ and it won't be an uncertain sound he said now we hear the sounding of trouble coming atomic palms hanging everywhere this stress between nations perplex of time he said why would we worry about about about a job while we worry about home while we worry about anything Jesus never told us to worry but said when you see these things begin to come to pass he said lift up your heads and rejoice lift up your heads tonight and

preachers preach your appreciate but it's evil Oliveri your precept our hands in your Brian a man so just for a quick thought just to bring the countdown if you tell them quickly with me to two portions of scripture I want to get that out and then have a few comments and when every from Hebrews 10 just Hebrews 10 just one verse of scripture in there and reading from Ephesians six we read from Ephesians first actually Ephesians six and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil Ephesians six reading verse from verse 12 now for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God I'm reading Hebrews 10 and verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which had great recompense of reward be the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his work and we bow our heads over the frail heavenly founder your word has been preached to us tonight Lord with power with demonstration and clarity the way your prophet would want it to be preached father and lo we thank you for the word has already gone forth father we pray it'll be a blessing to the people and it will find good ground and father as we transition into the new year may you open our understanding to who we are in you may you break every chain may you break every shackle may you break doubt and unbelief may you lift the veil of tiredness for the next few moments that we can come into the new year Lord in a right place in the right time in the right perspective on things may you bless the wood that has just been read Lord may you walk on the pages of the Bible and speak to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may

be announced at the Lord having been involved in a serious accident yesterday god be praised and after better Anthony was talking about the angels they don't sleep they are always an assignment wherever you call a home the Bible says the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him they don't have a choice in their eyes there are at this patch they're on assignment they are on a mission when you are sleep on a mission when you wake up be on a mission when you walk into your child here on a mission to protect you to make sure that you get what God promised for you can the church say Amen also from sisters civil I want to find the scenes with Leah prayers which were answered by speedy relief speedy relief of my symptoms God be praised with his finished work that's the core be searched by my my my my mind but a George Maharis yet but the George do you mind sending God bless you with the George for those of you who don't know how to put a George Mahone 77 years old I want you to hear this testimony be going out this year with a shout Tory on Friday the 13 of December I started experiencing a slight pain on the left of my chest later in the evening it became very severe I could barely walk or talk I began gasping for breath my daughter took me to the sangre granny hospital and he put me on a stretcher to lie down for observation all my organs had started to shut down and the doctor told my daughter that most likely I was going today he told her and I had a major and very severe heart attack and that I had to be transferred to the section for patient that were in a very bad state the hospital had a lot of patients and was overcrowded so it happened that I remain in the same spot for over 50 minutes after 15 minutes the doctor passed by again and examined me he was in awe he told my daughter this is a man of God he said God likes this man there's gonna like you it's not why you made it to this season is this why you made it to this hour you maybe see that what the doctor didn't get his not caught like SimCorp loves him and it's because he loved him he died for him because he loved him he made a way for him because he loved him he heal them you may be seated the doctor said the miraculous and drastic improvement and he saw in me he had never seen before dr. Satcher reached after eyes haven't seen years after him before with a person of my age 77 years old you know it is 77 I'm Cornelia you mean your work not done yet [Music] captured semen seen before with a person of my age who had experienced such a massive heart attack in just 15 minutes the recovery was 15 minutes thank God for God was in control they kept me for four days to do other tests on Tuesday morning the doctor asked me if I wanted to go home he did a final test and said mr. monk you are ready to go home I just want to present an NGO to be alive today thank you for healing me I am a walking miracle tonight Thank You seeds and the ministry for all the prayers and the support god bless you better charge caring is another shout of praise [Music] you maybe see them for a few minutes so I want to greet you tonight in a precious theme of Jesus Christ on behalf of our pastor beloved and sister Ovid who in Ghana right now but they extend their greetings on behalf of the pastoral office we really want to wish you a happy and blessed New Year and may God richly bless things be upon you your household your families and me the pyramid of your lives be kept made a chains that have held you for how long they have held you be broken in this season may the sickness and the baggage that you have carried be dropped off in 2018 and not reached 2019 and may be that the Egyptians you have seen for all your years because they would have seen the Egyptians for a long time but this day Moses said you will see them no more forever can the church shame and so I have a small fort and I'm gonna try to get it done in a few minutes and we cross the new year with this thought and by the gorge I have to admit you helped inspire the thought and the thought is connected to Ephesians having done all to stand the stand so I took a text tonight still standing still standing after I went through all I went to I'm still standing after I lost health I'm still standing after I made this mistake that mistake the devil thought he had me out I'm still standing when they thought I would backslide and never come back to church I'm still standing when they thought that the devil had me and nothing would freak me out or what I was in I'm still standing I'm not where I'm supposed to be but I'm not where I used to be but by the grace of God at the end of 2018 I'm still standing oh can the church shame him oh and that has been the testimony you may be seated of every hero that better Anthony spoke about Paul was shipwrecked but when he wrote this he was still standing he had been bitten by the Sun's up but even though he had been bitten the poison of the supper cut stop him he was still standing there boya-chan in oil and when they turned the oil off and tony was dead he walked out of here he was still standing and whatever trial situation problem persecution nothing past present takes to come could knock you down and even if you fall you will still get strength to struggle back up and looked at devil in the face and say Satan I'm still standing I'm standing on the promise of God I'm standing on Malachi fourth message understanding you may be seated just a few more minutes told you already that the preaching I'm just giving you new year greetings job lost everything he lost his children he lost his money he lost his property he lost his own health and at the end of the day he was still standing the Hebrew boys it was because they were still standing they put him in the fiery furnace he would not bow down he was still standing and because they were standing they put him in the fire and in the fire they were still standing when the man ended up SIA and tonight we are still standing on the promise world has brought by the prophet of Malachi for you maybe see this for a minute anybody sleeping if tab can make sure they're not sleeping because you can't go until 2019 sleeping make sure they're not sleeping you made me see that one Tanner is a school teacher and she had a boy in the class who was giving trouble he kept standing up sitting down standing up to me he's in sit down he kept standing up this sit-downs kept standing up she hit him eyelashes stop Danny Lee's had a smile he was sitting on but he was smiling she said what you smiling for because I'm standing up inside so you may not have strength to stand up all the time but stand up inside is that's a prophecy you lose your teeth you come the devil you use your foot somebody help me somebody you gotta shout of praise hallelujah still stagnant when they sent all the men to get something it was about 3000 or whatever to one man they thought that 3,000 men would take out Samson but when they came upon Samson Samson found a little jawbone dr. brother branham said that trouble would have collapsed if it had hit what the helmets these men had but when he annoyed he came upon Samson listen it was not his train to Adam standing but it was the Holy Ghost had him standing you have not been carrying yourself it's so Holy Ghost has been carrying you you don't have strength to carry yourself but when the Holy Ghost gets up on you you can have it all you stand you may be seated I'm about finished we're almost there listen friends that scripture is such a study having done all to stand it means when you have done everything you could do the command and stand goes beyond your ability to even stand having not all to hold it together still wanted a stand having done all to stand is that point when you want to give up because you did all you could to policy and stand when the doctor said you did everything and you should know turn it in and by the mahasiddhas to see you're in a bad state but something was holding him he couldn't operate on himself he couldn't change the situation around but God was standing for him and if you stand for God he'll stand for you he has never feel he will never feel he is a God of his word he's a car of his promise hallelujah you take a little more Televi platino stop sinner you can't tell me a time there's somebody somewhere no starter jumper there's somebody somewhere knows isn't excited for 2019 I've got to be excited because I'm looking for the sick to be healed I'm looking for the blind eyes to pop open I'm looking for you to be blessed until your cup run over I'm looking for you to see the Holy Ghost all over you and the church see him give the Lord a shout afraid give the Lord a shout of praise listen friends you cannot feel because God cannot feel I'll say that again you cannot feel because God cannot feel you heard it's already tonight you are not a believer but in Stephen said that the word seed in you that's the believer that's who is saying Amen that's who's standing it's not your flesh standing but the seed in your soul you didn't even put it there your mother didn't put it here your father didn't put it here but call himself what the seed in your soul I mean that word seed is healing in that word seed is deliverance in that word serious power in that would see this dynamics in that word seed are the attributes of God that will be made manifest in your life the devil is in trouble turn to your neighbor and tell them the devil is in trouble because you belong to God the devil is in trouble because you don't belong to the devil the devil is in trouble because even though you might be back slither you're still standing you see standing don't listen you can have cuts on your body understand me you can be tired and you still standing you can tie yourself to the pole and you still standing the important thing is you made it those 120 disciples the immediately open he made it to the right place at the right time the Bible says they were afraid they were hiding but then all of a sudden they came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and fill the whole house where they was setting and all we have been waiting for for all these years is to come to the Upper Room experience as tri-c's for the same Holy Ghost because when the branham's had the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was in the day of Pentecost I'm not preaching on new Holy Ghost I'm not pitching a new message it's the same Holy Ghost it's the same anointing it's ashame power it's the same spirit it'll make you stop your lion it'll make you forgive your brother it'll send the terror flying it'll make you lift your hand and I'll make you give God praise hallelujah listen friends I'm getting ready to close out sickness have a beginning and must have an ending don't have a beginning and must have an ending but a Branham taught us everything that had a beginning must have an ending but you never had a beginning because you are eternal you come from the eternal section of course mine so you never had a beginning you are part of Cora when God existed by himself you were there when he created the Sun you were there when he put the Oh somebody help me [Music] you may be set up set it before you know what that makes you it makes you older than the devil because you existed before the devil because you are in the eternal section of God in the back part of his mind in his thoughts as he was thinking he had you there waiting for the right season for flesh of my flesh born of my born spirit of my spirit and for all these years when you are born you're born with amnesia you're born with an identity crisis as well as even preach you wake up in a barnyard barnyard in your house wherever your host is he was upon you even if you're born any message it was a banya because you have to know who you are your identification is not peace and who your father is who your mother is or if you bought any message it has nothing to do with that but one day when you hear the Eagle call and say wait a minute have Allard rock rock music I've heard jazz music I've heard R&B music I've heard slow music but this Eagle music is different I bet in the world I've done this but this this anointing is different that's where the Anthony said this method and Hennessey this method I'm alcohol is better than drugs there's nothing like this joy there's nothing like this there's nothing like this victory [Music] so as we get deeper into 2019 I want to encourage you to go deeper than you've ever gone before go deeper in your prayer life go deeper in your worship go deeper in your sacrifice good teapot to go after your family go deeper to go after your loved one get excited about your healing if your foot has had a brightness for a long time start to move it in advance move it in advance because it's about to be healed or you don't hear me this morning we've already reached morning welcome to 2019 so you might as well start a practice you might as well start a practice if you have body pre inside to tell you what it means accounting don't I just making sure that you're still there because I let you know you have to go somebody preach back to me depression has got to go frustration has got to go lust has got to go sin has got to go your pass has got to go your mistakes have got to go this is the year Jubilee this is the year of my redeemer stop give the Lord a soda praise [Music] I'm still standing listen I'm closing up standing not on my idea of my interpretation or my opinion but I'm standing on the promise would of malachi for this message is real it works every time if you apply it and that's a problem with us you know you're not Trinitarians when you buy something people like to start to use of an already manual people and the first thing they say it's not working they've getting device years ago before people understand what vcr was it they put it in the planting and thing and i see you not but i think i'm not working but if you really manual I see well dunes and somebody warned you do not connect this part before you do this I mean II realize you don't mess up because you choose to not really instructions on how to
