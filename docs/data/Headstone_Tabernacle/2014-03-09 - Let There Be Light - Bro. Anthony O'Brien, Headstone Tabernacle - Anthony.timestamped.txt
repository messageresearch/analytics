[15:12] spirit you're going to redeem your body
[15:15] hallelujah when he died he paid for you
[15:18] all of you
[15:19] he will redeem all of you
[15:21] your imagination your conscience your

[15:52] how many feel like raining this morning
[15:54] ruling this morning
[15:56] overcoming this morning
[15:58] being straightened in the inner man this
[16:00] morning
[16:01] that's what they're here for this
[16:02] morning to be edified to be built up
[16:06] to be strengthened oh glory hallelujah
[16:09] amen thank you musician
[16:11] amen
[16:12] praise god blessed be the name of the
[16:15] lord well i know you're in for a
[16:16] blessing this morning
[16:17] but anthony gonna be preaching to us
[16:19] this morning
[16:20] amen i appreciate anthony
[16:23] oh god has blessed him
[16:25] and a special blessing to me and the
[16:27] church i know you
[16:29] bless him amen
[16:31] thank god for the gifts and talents that
[16:33] god has placed among us and just want to
[16:36] read something here before he comes on
[16:38] from god keeps his word he said in here
[16:40] and long ago the lutherans did have the
[16:42] torchlight to the world what happened if
[16:44] you would run out in the world you look
[16:46] to run people at one time at the first
[16:49] reformation what happened to you your
[16:50] light what what what did it go out
[16:53] this is the reason it went out is
[16:55] because you left god's word you believe
[16:58] that joshua led by faith absolutely the
[17:00] truth then along came the methodists and
[17:03] they had the torchlight of
[17:04] resignification you did hold the
[17:06] torchlight a great revival that's true
[17:08] but what happened what happened to the
[17:09] methodist church because you let the
[17:11] light out your pre-signification second
[17:13] worker grace and then came the
[17:15] pentecostal with the restoration of
[17:16] gifts and they made a doctrinal to that
[17:19] what happened your light's gone out
[17:21] what's the matter is because you feel to
[17:23] stay with the word
[17:25] so when we feel to the stay with the
[17:27] word the light goes out
[17:29] i'll say it again when you fail to say
[17:30] with the word light goes out
[17:33] watch god words will unfold in here we
[17:36] go and we must
[17:39] unfold
[17:41] as god word unfolds
[17:44] we must unfold
[17:47] as god word unfolds as time unfolds as
[17:52] signs unfolds
[17:54] this man is the same man he was six
[17:56] thousand years ago when god made him
[17:58] sementa intellectual same intelligence
[18:01] he's the same man with the same senses
[18:04] that he was thousands of years ago but
[18:06] look at the progress that he has made in
[18:08] the past 50 years
[18:10] look what the fallen sons of god has did
[18:13] automobiles radio electric lights atomic
[18:16] bombs and here
[18:18] the church back some old church creed
[18:20] stand there when god listen wants us to
[18:24] unfold the word
[18:26] this is what god wants us to do your
[18:28] life to unfold the word so you will be
[18:32] truly be a written epistle
[18:34] rather known of all men and somebody
[18:36] asked by the brahmana and these seven
[18:38] thunders when is revealed will it be
[18:40] something to get us closer to god he
[18:42] said no it's something that they missed
[18:43] back there because people were looking
[18:45] for instant cure
[18:47] they're looking for some way to avoid
[18:49] place of trying
[18:50] to avoid the death of a corn or wheat
[18:53] so they taught do they know all
[18:54] mysteries and they have all knowledge
[18:56] they have everything only the final paul
[18:59] already handled that
[19:01] he still say you need charity so the
[19:03] information or knowledge or revelation
[19:06] that's not good enough you have to die
[19:08] out still and paul said it i die daily
[19:12] you have to repent still you have to
[19:14] humble yourself still isn't that right
[19:16] he said now watch he said we are back he
[19:18] said now watch he said what it is grace
[19:20] we should be unfolding
[19:22] god's spirit pouring out
[19:25] not just one little gusher
[19:27] not just one little baptism but baptism
[19:31] after baptism
[19:32] not a revelation joshua by faith or
[19:35] signification or the gifts of spirit but
[19:38] revelation after revelation
[19:40] power after power
[19:42] glory after glory for we ought to be way
[19:45] up the road ready for translation
[19:47] so that is what god wants unfolded
[19:49] revelation after revelation power after
[19:52] power glory after glory in other words
[19:54] we get in rapture and condition to get
[19:57] out of here
[19:58] praise god as we get press in our way
[20:01] we're supposed to see the satan grip on
[20:03] our life loosed
[20:05] praise god he's supposed to be relaxing
[20:07] his hand
[20:08] when he having a luck jock jawed here to
[20:11] lock you up here we supposed to be he'll
[20:13] see it and break in his hands because
[20:15] you are getting more powerful
[20:17] remember the devil cannot get any
[20:18] stronger but you can
[20:21] i'm not hearing you this morning
[20:23] praise god hallelujah hallelujah praise
[20:27] god amen amen
[20:29] praise be to jesus hallelujah so we're
[20:32] supposed to be unfolding the word
[20:34] power after power revelation after
[20:36] revelation not depression after
[20:38] depression and frustration after
[20:40] frustration and fed up after fed up not
[20:42] that
[20:45] oh hallelujah are you with me oh blessed
[20:48] be the name of the lord praise his holy
[20:50] name
[20:51] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[20:54] name of the lord say love him this
[20:56] morning
[20:57] praise god so we supposed to be
[20:59] unfolding that word
[21:00] twisting and hungering for god
[21:02] and brother braham said the intellectual
[21:05] cannot in any way bring any person to
[21:07] god
[21:08] the intellect
[21:09] he's talking about and he spoke about
[21:11] the lie detector
[21:14] that connects with the condition of the
[21:15] soul
[21:17] not the mind
[21:18] but the heart i think we're talking
[21:20] about it tuesday night and when you
[21:22] connect that like detected and actually
[21:24] question your line the machine starting
[21:26] to make us say that noise like light
[21:27] light light light light start to see a
[21:28] lie and you're lying you're lying
[21:30] because even though you're talking soft
[21:33] even talking words and whatnot the
[21:35] pressure goes up you you know you're
[21:37] lying yourself
[21:38] and the machines say you're lying too
[21:40] so there's a confirmation choose a
[21:42] witness you know and mushy no
[21:45] so therefore he was saying the intellect
[21:47] doesn't govern that channel
[21:50] so when somebody dies the intellect
[21:52] breaks up
[21:53] all the thinking oh what the money they
[21:55] have on the degrees and how people see
[21:57] them in the world and you know your
[22:00] reputation all that breaks up because
[22:02] at the intellectual level
[22:04] but the soul start to raise up so before
[22:07] god
[22:08] and the soul is the condition that comes
[22:10] right up to face god not what you
[22:13] believe you believe whatever you want to
[22:15] believe i believe the apostle creed
[22:17] how'd he catholic say that believe in
[22:19] holy mary and what not mother of god
[22:21] that is just belief that's here but your
[22:23] soul is what grace up to god remember
[22:26] you're not an animal
[22:27] you have a body
[22:28] you have a spirit
[22:30] you have a soul the intellect is what
[22:32] breaks up
[22:34] hallelujah
[22:36] god takes the heart
[22:38] the devil takes the head
[22:41] let's cut off that head intellectual and
[22:43] let's start to believe what god couldn't
[22:45] do for us in our heart
[22:47] it has to come back to your heart as a
[22:49] man think in his heart so is he
[22:51] not so much as head what you want in
[22:53] your heart you want a revival this
[22:54] morning you got you got it
[22:56] you want a breakthrough this morning you
[22:58] got it
[22:59] if you have that in your heart you want
[23:00] to be changed this morning you got it
[23:02] oh glory to god so watch
[23:05] it seems to me
[23:06] and by the word god could only work
[23:08] within his laws
[23:10] even on earth
[23:12] and now he said it before
[23:13] that when abraham lied
[23:15] and abraham say was his sister and the
[23:18] king wanted to take abram a wife to be
[23:20] white because she was so beautiful
[23:22] god shut up the wombs in that house and
[23:24] said listen restore that prophet his
[23:26] wife
[23:27] and let him pray for you
[23:29] that that could lift off of you
[23:32] in other words god was working through a
[23:33] certain system
[23:34] and you can't break that system
[23:36] god's going to walk to the brine
[23:38] and you can't break that either
[23:40] i'll say this we're going to work
[23:42] through you
[23:43] and you can't break that either
[23:45] that means god going to get you in
[23:47] condition
[23:48] by any means hallelujah are you going to
[23:50] get you in condition you've got to get
[23:53] in condition that means the word have to
[23:55] be opened up to you
[23:57] which word are you ready
[24:00] your
[24:03] my words a bomb this morning
[24:05] you're wondering where we are going with
[24:07] that right which word your word because
[24:09] when your word come yo would come
[24:11] until his word came the word of the lord
[24:13] tried him but when joseph word come
[24:16] nobody could keep you in prison not when
[24:18] your word come
[24:19] that word come to get you out of prison
[24:22] that would come to set the captive free
[24:24] that would come to heal the sick that
[24:26] would come to raise the dead when your
[24:28] word come no devil could hold you back
[24:31] when you're overcome y'all come
[24:33] could we give the lord a shout i pray
[24:36] glory to god amen
[24:42] hallelujah
[24:44] i'm finishing around
[24:46] john the baptist had to wait for the
[24:48] call to go in the wilderness he knew he
[24:50] was different because he had a different
[24:51] name from zechariah hezekiah whatever
[24:53] ayah or whatever it is his name was
[24:54] called john he made a name all together
[24:57] but he had to get the call to go into
[24:58] wilderness to become the voice of one
[25:00] crown of wilderness his word had to come
[25:03] to place him positionally where he's
[25:05] supposed to be his word had to come and
[25:08] when his word come nobody could stop him
[25:10] from going to wilderness he knew once he
[25:13] hit the wilderness messiah is on his way
[25:15] because he had to come from the
[25:16] wilderness to introduce messiah and you
[25:19] have to come from the wilderness to
[25:21] return in the power of the spirit
[25:23] when you hit the wilderness you know
[25:25] power is coming when you're in calvary
[25:27] you know power is coming when you hit
[25:30] the death of a corner wheat come on now
[25:32] dynamics is to drive the people to
[25:34] calvary i'm 10 in the rapture you know
[25:36] you're getting somewhere when you are
[25:39] dying and christ is coming to life
[25:50] that
[25:51] they have to take a hold upon you and
[25:54] that is separation rotten brings forth
[25:56] the new bird
[25:58] so first the dead comes to cut it off
[26:00] the tree and then it falls on the ground
[26:02] on your rock you're right to this you
[26:03] rot to that we have to die
[26:05] and i know that haven't struck the bride
[26:07] yet this thing called death people want
[26:09] a free ticket like a passport just put a
[26:11] stamp in your book you move through but
[26:14] unfortunately there's a program that god
[26:16] have and that program said activate
[26:18] virtue and to virtue knowledge and we
[26:20] cannot get around this program no matter
[26:22] how much we try every time you think
[26:24] about it that's it that's you there
[26:26] see you don't know that's you yet
[26:28] because that wouldn't come to you the
[26:29] way it's supposed to come here when that
[26:31] would open to you you will want that
[26:33] just to be you
[26:34] not your ungodliness but godliness not
[26:36] your impatience but that's you dear
[26:38] that's your word express that's what you
[26:41] have to become that's what you're
[26:42] striving into you're striving to be the
[26:44] statue of a perfect man that is you
[26:47] i am telling you that's you
[26:52] that hateful anger temper and you have
[26:54] psychological problem and all kind of
[26:56] problem that's not you
[26:57] that's just mind games and that's just
[26:59] all kind of crazy stuff and hereditary
[27:02] stuff forget about that that's you there
[27:04] that's what you have to become and
[27:05] you're shy that's not you this is you
[27:07] yeah this this this what is that to you
[27:10] that's what you're going to become
[27:12] hallelujah and you become what you
[27:13] behold
[27:14] hallelujah we see in a glass and then
[27:17] praise god face oh we become what we
[27:19] behold
[27:20] you have to see a reflection to become
[27:22] that
[27:23] you see the reflection is the perfection
[27:25] not the talking not the preaching the
[27:27] reflection is the perfection these
[27:30] virtues have to be reflected
[27:36] anthony going to come to us now
[27:38] oh hallelujah these virtues have to live
[27:42] i know you'll be hearing that but it's
[27:43] the truth
[27:44] you see we think confession is going to
[27:46] live confession means uh saying we
[27:48] believe this and that's our confession
[27:51] our testimony and so on but you see the
[27:53] authority to believe doesn't give you
[27:54] the authority to live
[27:56] a lot of people believe a lot of things
[27:58] and they're not living anything to do
[27:59] with what they believe it doesn't even
[28:00] connect because believing have to do
[28:02] with intellect
[28:03] but life have to do with the heart
[28:06] hallelujah that's why jesus could ask
[28:07] the wonder well go call your husband
[28:09] question
[28:10] she had a choice
[28:12] she had a choice to play mind games with
[28:14] him and she had a choice to speak the
[28:15] truth
[28:16] she chose to speak the truth
[28:19] he said you speak the truth
[28:21] and you had five and the one you're
[28:23] living with is not yours and that's what
[28:25] god wanted he wanted her heart
[28:28] to speak
[28:30] a lot of us we have not yet come to the
[28:32] place that we could speak our hearts
[28:35] and for ministers
[28:37] they don't even want honest conversation
[28:39] they're not supposed to speak you're
[28:40] supposed to say tremendous every message
[28:42] is tremendous more tremendous most
[28:45] tremendous tremendous tremendous
[28:47] tremendously management but that's not
[28:48] so
[28:50] that's not true
[28:51] some message doesn't be trending at all
[28:54] it has to be disturbing and troubling
[28:56] and troublesome and and make your spirit
[28:58] get funny up because it's not tremendous
[29:01] and that's the truth
[29:02] and that's what we have to come place to
[29:03] no truth i want to be edified i want to
[29:06] be built up i want to be strengthened
[29:08] when i leave here i want to know i could
[29:09] run after the devil i said get out
[29:12] i want to hear i want to leave you i
[29:14] feel like an overcomer

[29:24] go back and hear my fussing wife

[29:34] not patience when things are nazi and

[29:46] cool when everybody's upset and
[29:48] hot-headed and you demonstrate
[29:50] temperance that is when it thunders
[29:53] so you're not looking for everything to
[29:54] be nice know these virtues are nothing

[37:25] so
[37:26] amen
[37:28] so you can find genesis 1
[37:31] we'll start from there
[37:39] amen genesis 1
[37:41] and verse 1
[37:43] says in the beginning
[37:45] god created the heaven and the earth
[37:49] and the earth was without form and void
[37:51] and darkness was upon the face of the
[37:53] deep
[37:54] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[37:57] face of the waters
[37:59] and god said let there be light
[38:02] and there was light
[38:04] and god saw the light
[38:07] that it was good and god divided the
[38:10] light
[38:11] from the darkness
[38:12] and god called the light day
[38:15] and the darkness he called night
[38:17] and the evening and the morning with the
[38:20] first day
[38:21] let's go over now to isaiah 60.
[38:25] reading from verse 1.
[38:30] amen isaiah 16 and verse 1
[38:36] amen which says arise and shine
[38:40] arise shine for thy light is come
[38:43] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[38:46] thee
[38:47] for behold
[38:48] the darkness shall cover the earth
[38:50] and gross darkness the people
[38:53] but the lord shall arise upon thee
[38:56] and his glory shall be seen upon thee
[38:59] and the gentiles shall come to thy light
[39:02] and kings to the brightness of thy
[39:05] rising amen let's go over last later ii

[39:28] says
[39:29] uh
[39:31] for we have not followed amen second
[39:33] peter 1 16
[39:35] says for we have not followed cunningly
[39:37] devised fables
[39:39] when we made known unto you the power
[39:41] and coming of our lord jesus christ
[39:44] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[39:48] for he received from god the father
[39:50] honor and glory
[39:52] when there came such a voice to him
[39:55] from the excellent glory
[39:57] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[40:00] pleased
[40:01] and this voice which came from heaven we
[40:03] heard
[40:04] when we were with him in the holy mount
[40:07] we have also a more sure word of
[40:11] prophecy
[40:12] where unto ye do well that ye take heed
[40:15] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[40:19] place
[40:19] until the day dawn and the daystar arise
[40:23] in your hearts may lord have a blessing

[46:25] that's why that's the first thing that
[46:27] god declared
[46:29] when he saw everything in its void and
[46:31] his darkness everything in its chaos and

[48:36] he said it was good
[48:39] oh hallelujah it's a good thing to be in
[48:41] the light
[48:43] hallelujah you are not of them that walk
[48:45] in darkness
[48:46] hallelujah hallelujah when jesus came on
[48:48] the scene the bible said them that sat
[48:51] in darkness saw a great light
[48:53] hallelujah praise god and his lights
[48:55] praise god was a life of man
[48:58] hallelujah and when the darkness saw it
[49:00] they didn't understand it
[49:04] that's why jesus amen i admire jesus how
[49:06] he used to move
[49:08] he didn't move with the crowd of that
[49:10] day
[49:11] the crowd of that day was the pharisees
[49:12] and the sadducees and them who was great
[49:15] uh studios of the bible and so on but he
[49:18] wasn't moving in that realm he was in a
[49:20] different realm
[49:21] he wasn't in that ecclesiastical realm
[49:23] with those kinds
[49:24] he was in that intellectual realm with
[49:26] those fellas he was somewhere else
[49:29] lost in the spirit hallelujah i do
[49:31] nothing except the father show me that's
[49:33] why he could find himself somewhere at
[49:35] the 11th hour
[49:37] sitting at a well
[49:38] waiting for our ill-famed woman
[49:42] hello ain't many many man
[49:46] the bible says she was ill-famed
[49:48] holly i can imagine what she looked like
[49:50] i could imagine how she used to dress
[49:52] and carry about herself she probably
[49:54] wasn't the kind of woman that you would
[49:55] like to be seen hanging around with
[49:57] hallelujah but her name was on the book
[50:00] she was a seed that was in itself in the
[50:02] earth
[50:05] hallelujah hallelujah she was waiting to
[50:07] be called out she waited to be separated
[50:10] she was waited to be anointed to go into
[50:12] the upper room but she had to wait
[50:16] oh hallelujah i don't know how long she
[50:18] waited the bible said she had five men
[50:21] and the one that she was with was not
[50:22] her own a little but she was waiting on
[50:25] something she was destined for something
[50:28] or one day she come to the well it
[50:30] looked like an ordinary day because
[50:32] that's normally the hour that she would
[50:34] come to the well hallelujah and jesus
[50:37] hallelujah had his gps set up because he
[50:39] knew when she would leave home he knew
[50:41] when she would take the maxi hallelujah
[50:44] when she would take the car coming down
[50:46] the road so elohim positioned his lights
[50:49] at the well because he knew that there
[50:52] was a sea to be called out
[50:55] in our time inner season
[50:58] praise god
[50:59] hallelujah
[51:00] her day had come
[51:02] glory to god and your day is here this
[51:04] morning i don't care how you feel
[51:07] i don't care how you woke up this
[51:09] morning we are here to declare the light
[51:11] day
[51:12] and the darkness night praise god
[51:14] hallelujah let's cast off the work of
[51:16] darkness let us put on the arm of light
[51:30] amen i'm just floating this morning
[51:32] wherever god wants me to move out that's
[51:34] where i move
[51:35] amen amen but he spoke to the woman at
[51:37] the well he said woman yahweh cometh
[51:39] when the true worshipers will worship
[51:41] the father and spirit and in truth
[51:44] because they will have the light of the
[51:45] revealed word to declare their hour and
[51:48] their season hallelujah he said the hour
[51:50] come and now is when the true worshipers
[51:53] will worship the father i declare that
[51:56] now is that our
[51:57] now is that day
[51:59] jesus said on that day you shall know i
[52:01] am in the father you and me and i and
[52:03] you the light is here to declare the day
[52:11] oh hallelujah get a little praise amen
[52:14] glory hallelujah
[52:21] so god saw that the light was good amen
[52:24] and he separated the light
[52:27] from the darkness
[52:28] he called a light day
[52:30] and he called the darkness light
[52:32] so right there we see that god
[52:35] caused a separation
[52:38] between a light and a darkness
[52:40] amen there are things that are of the
[52:41] light
[52:42] and then there are things that are of
[52:44] the darkness
[52:45] amen young people
[52:47] you have to know which is which
[52:49] and the word will show you what is light
[52:51] and the word will show you what is
[52:53] darkness
[52:54] that's why you have to be in the word
[52:56] i like whatever it said earlier amen
[52:58] from the quotes amen he said if the
[53:00] light leaves amen amen you're in
[53:02] darkness amen however you have to leave
[53:04] your word you're in darkness so you have
[53:06] to come to your word isn't that right
[53:08] hallelujah that you'll not walk in
[53:10] darkness amen because we are not
[53:12] children of the darkness
[53:14] we are the children of the light
[53:16] hallelujah you are called to this
[53:18] glorious light amen light hallelujah
[53:20] praise god i sprung up amen isn't that
[53:22] right
[53:24] hey many man okay

[53:28] story here
[53:30] brother branham spoke
[53:33] amen i'll read okay amen i'll read this
[53:35] story here but abandon spoke on a
[53:36] message turn on the light
[53:38] amen it's big at the very beginning of
[53:40] the message
[53:41] and he said something and it really
[53:42] struck me and i'll just read it
[53:45] he says uh you know mr mcconnelly i
[53:46] think he's present i see his truck
[53:48] outside some time ago
[53:50] he said we're setting
[53:52] one of my first trips here to arizona to
[53:54] go hunting
[53:55] and we were sitting out there near the
[53:57] superstitious mountain
[53:59] he said and i heard of it for a long
[54:01] time
[54:02] and heard of many of the legends that
[54:04] have been told about the superstition
[54:07] i remember looking for it
[54:09] the first time and it was before day so
[54:11] it was it was it was still dark
[54:14] so it's before day and he said and a
[54:16] great ghostly shadow hung at the east of
[54:18] me which was known as the superstition
[54:22] and i heard about the indians how they
[54:24] would they wouldn't go near it
[54:26] how they were afraid how the spanish had
[54:28] mistreated them in the early days and
[54:30] they were hunting gold and so on and
[54:32] they claimed that these evil spirits
[54:33] were living in it
[54:35] and all this stood my curiosity but i
[54:38] only had a flashing light to see the
[54:40] superstition at first
[54:42] so and then i watched until after a
[54:45] while
[54:46] the the majesty of the sun
[54:49] began to move upon the darkness
[54:52] and when it did it separated the
[54:55] darkness from the light
[54:57] and pressed the darkness back
[55:00] finally she raised to her highness
[55:03] up over the top of the mountain talking
[55:05] about the sun and it showed superstition
[55:08] just what it was
[55:10] it all lit up and showed what it was
[55:14] and all the spooks
[55:16] and fears that i had of superstition
[55:19] when the sun was shining in its power
[55:22] upon it it fled away
[55:25] he said the sun is the king of all the
[55:27] lights on this earth
[55:29] in the natural lights no matter how much
[55:32] artificial light that we have
[55:35] and how many great electric rays that we
[55:37] can produce
[55:38] when that sun rises
[55:41] all the rest of them dim out
[55:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[55:48] and i feel like today we're living in an
[55:50] age of a lot of superficial lights
[55:54] a lot of superficial lights hanging
[55:55] around here and there
[55:57] amen and it was prophesied that many
[55:59] will come in my name and say i am christ
[56:00] and deceive many superficial lights
[56:03] isn't that right
[56:04] but he said amen when that sun rises all
[56:07] of the rest of them dim out
[56:10] that's the same thing it is with the
[56:12] word of god oh here we go now he said
[56:15] when the word of god rises
[56:17] he said all superstitions
[56:20] denominational fanaticism and fantasism
[56:23] and things spread away
[56:25] and it just shows just exactly what it
[56:28] is
[56:29] god in the beginning said let there be
[56:32] light
[56:33] and the light only comes he said the
[56:35] true light the king light comes by the
[56:38] word of god
[56:39] and god separated the light from the
[56:41] darkness in the beginning and the word
[56:44] of god listen to this now said the word
[56:46] of god
[56:47] made manifest always separates the light
[56:51] from the darkness
[56:52] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[56:55] the word of god i'll say that again the
[56:56] word of god made manifest always
[57:00] separates the light from the darkness
[57:02] hallelujah so what are we waiting on a
[57:04] manifestation
[57:06] we've had a revelation for a long time
[57:08] coming on to something coming on to
[57:10] something what are we coming on to a
[57:12] manifestation and when a word of god is
[57:15] manifested
[57:16] one day your word will come to you
[57:19] one day you're gonna rise up
[57:21] the son of god hallelujah will rise up
[57:25] inside of you that day star arising in
[57:28] your hearts hallelujah one of these days
[57:30] you're gonna be known as you are known
[57:33] and you're gonna manifest the same life
[57:35] the same signs the same wonders the same
[57:38] miracles that he manifested
[57:40] and when that word of god is manifested
[57:43] it will separate the light from the
[57:45] darkness
[57:46] oh hallelujah there's a lot of darkness
[57:48] in this message
[57:49] there's a lot of darkness and confusion
[57:51] going around what are we looking for a
[57:53] manifestation
[57:55] of the word of god for this hour a
[57:57] manifestation of the word of god for
[57:59] this day to separate the light from the
[58:01] darkness
[58:04] so you mean to tell me brother anthony
[58:06] there's another ministry coming they are
[58:08] going to separate the light from the
[58:09] darkness how about manifestation of the
[58:12] world
[58:13] to declare the light of their hour and
[58:15] their day
[58:16] to call the light day at the colder
[58:18] darkness night
[58:22] hallelujah amen do you believe that
[58:25] praise god that's what it's about amen
[58:27] okay i want to switch over here now amen
[58:29] please go on hallelujah
[58:31] he many man do you love him
[58:34] hey man are you enjoying the word so far
[58:38] amen priest god
[58:40] okay
[58:42] all right so let me read this here now
[58:44] says from god god's word called for
[58:45] total separation said now in the
[58:47] beginning
[58:48] genesis 1 3 said we find that there was
[58:50] darkness amen upon the earth amen and
[58:54] the spirit of god moved upon the water
[58:56] and said let there be light
[58:58] and there was light and god saw that the
[59:01] light was good and god separated the
[59:03] light from the darkness
[59:05] so the word of god began to separate the
[59:07] light from the darkness from the
[59:09] beginning
[59:10] um says so does it remain till this day
[59:14] he said now when the earth okay when god
[59:17] was going to use the earth and it was in
[59:19] total darkness the spirit of god spoke
[59:22] out and said let there be light
[59:25] and he separated the light from the
[59:27] darkness and it has been doing that ever
[59:30] since separating light from darkness
[59:34] god's word also separated the water from
[59:37] the land in the beginning god spoke and
[59:39] the water was separated from the land
[59:42] amen land this way and water this way is
[59:44] that right said so that he and he had a
[59:47] reason for that
[59:48] and god never speaks a word unless he's
[59:51] got a reason for speaking that word
[59:54] he says he's not like you and i we just
[59:57] he said we speak so many foolish things
[59:59] he said but god speaks every word with a
[1:00:02] meaning
[1:00:03] and with something that he's trying to
[1:00:05] achieve
[1:00:06] and will achieve it by his word and it
[1:00:09] will perform exactly what it will do
[1:00:13] amen isn't that right so if god sends
[1:00:15] out a word there's a a mission for it to
[1:00:18] accomplish there's something that it has
[1:00:20] to achieve
[1:00:21] it is not a mindless order amen amen is
[1:00:24] not some chaos amen hallelujah is a word
[1:00:27] spoken in due season how pleasant and
[1:00:30] how good it is amen we have a word in
[1:00:32] our season we have a word for our day
[1:00:35] isn't that right praise god hallelujah
[1:00:37] hallelujah amen brother was talking
[1:00:40] earlier he said joseph when he come the
[1:00:41] word of the lord tried him until his
[1:00:44] word came that same word tried him amen
[1:00:48] amen he knew he was to come into a
[1:00:49] position of power isn't that right he
[1:00:51] knew he was to come into a position of
[1:00:53] authority but he had to die hallelujah
[1:00:56] to his intellect die to his beliefs die
[1:00:59] to all that he thought he was a many man
[1:01:02] hallelujah and stay in the glory of that
[1:01:04] light until become beaked out until he
[1:01:07] become ripened hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:10] hallelujah until something in him die
[1:01:13] hallelujah hallelujah praise god isn't
[1:01:15] that right
[1:01:16] hallelujah then his word come
[1:01:19] amen isn't that right
[1:01:21] hallelujah so the word of god will
[1:01:23] accomplish isn't that right
[1:01:24] he said no if god said
[1:01:26] let there be light and there was no
[1:01:28] light then he said that it wasn't god
[1:01:31] said
[1:01:32] said
[1:01:33] that wasn't god that said that see
[1:01:35] said when god says anything
[1:01:37] he must back up what he says
[1:01:42] must back up what he says
[1:01:44] oh is that why when joshua was waiting
[1:01:46] around jericho
[1:01:48] and god told him that he was gonna take
[1:01:50] the land and occupy the land and joshua
