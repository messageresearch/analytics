almost ripped a reed and let the preacher this morning I'm doing a minister to you please go and weather Isaac having a great time in Nigeria at a tremendous blessed you can go for that a real powerful service last length praise God so God is good and tongue good for this message and tongue good presenting us a prophet message that belongs to all of us he has nobody have a copyright on it does nobody have a have a right in it and more right than others it doesn't have all that sort of foolishness his God said behold I send you the world Elijah the prophet we are privileged to receive that Elijah that that prophet message what I want to say is that um Jesus ministry started first with healing and then prophecy are the second part of his ministry and then you know his ministry was the triple priestesses in prison and so the brides have that similar ministry for the Branham K made a sign to the brain and bring words of prophecy and we had to be puffy sign all these years and you prophesy before it happens if you prophesy of your healing before it happened you prophesy of deliverance before it happens and you can only do that if you go and get the book this book is if you call upon the name of the Lord and we we shared something uncommon um on Sunday about Caleb Tuesday writing permitting and you said ask it shall be given unto you all these words that Jesus spoke about vain words your card has beam on money just hoping some day and hoping God knew something no he said ask it shall be given unto you if God come down this morning and say ask what's going to ask him for what is the desire of your heart but what is posited in your spirit that is what is important ask and you have that because you acts not because you're asking you know you're not asking and full feet and believe in but you have to ask in order to get see if you have to get your breakthrough you get your blessing you have to ask God because hope go delivery when you have to ask Ord that core deliver your children that's why Caleb said give me my mountain I want it I am asking faith that's why the voice there the John go to the angel said give me the book look once that money in just watch the books it give me the book therefore you have to have a revelation as to what you have to possess so that is what church is all about church is to reconcile you back to your God church is not for

oh god my god people don't believe it but there is power in the blood Deborah salvation in the blood everything livers in the blood there is healing the blood Roman Asansol message this is some kind of Pentecostal sit down a minute daddy problem today's Ida problem right there the people are so educated the head we don't okay from say we emphasize too much the mechanics not enough on the dynamics so they have to have a switch in where we feel so inspired oh you see you but a burning on God send some possums you can put them in front about the brown home see what I wanna do after Wednesday's you know who was it like I send them to use the prefer them how much mystery up with statements a little fishy I give you back your life I must talk after prophecy before the Turkistan the wife of a big human being like a drip Fugees on your operating theater the duck is about to come down with that night and I mind spoke a word before the doctor son touches my wife the tumor will go down another damn hand come Onaga to mark of England [Music] Jesus took bread and five those two fishes and take it and blessed it and brake it and share it no complication no complications Tigra two fishes my problem no complication but I thank you for this bread blessed know he tell you that was to share it share what I wrote on two fishes yet after the multi-platinum fish cut somebody next to you I'm gonna share I'm going to share it work but all with my testimony is small just show what I have in my hand is small just seven even ask you to multiply you can talk to the sheriff and if you said you find your motor ship I forgive you find you a more together hallelujah sell what you have it's not complicated oh my I can't get to what I want to get through the challenge we have is dead but abandom said God was so mysterious let's change up what mysterious to complicated that he wanted to make himself simple to be understood by the simple so that was go challenge how do i how do I reveal myself I'm so mysterious although I always been the word became flesh but we could handle him you could touch Hallel all this were the mystery and book we could handle him because now the word they become more worthy what becomes less but then the word spoke out a mystery I had unfallen words and we have it because God notice the lecture is we have words we have books and we call it books we got a big argument I don't find so I like it so I do agree with that so intellect but yet before that word in the beginning was the word that was in the beginning but before the beginning there was a rainbow there was spirit so we fought about any argument this big debate or dispute there was the Spirit of God rainbow we have to go back to the rainbow could I see I told you you know grunting on come on but a brand new edition to teach now towards the end of the 4-h with the invasion of Constantinople by the Turks they sent the limits colors of the east to get the Greek manuscripts to the west the purity of the world and the teachings of true believers were thus disseminated not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the mud press produce the production of books does we find great hunger and demand for the Bible could be answered God raise up many mighty men of wish Peter was but one the about lieutenant Liu tan Yu da luta was not the only one many many men Goethe was one of them and Alvin and swingley and the two other luminaries besides there were many many more who I'm not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty work of God was actually hindered death by these very men ha ha that is something you know will the age come for books and printing and everything has a name Envy for the Lord but listen to a deeper insight of this watch the mighty work of God was actually hindered by these very men for one thing they did not oppose the church state marriage of the Nicene council but actually fostered that union you see the devil is very tricky if he got hit young one let me take an image level this is what but a man says here the defense of the gospel by the state was welcomed door there was no word for hit they come by the government is of the devil and the government under protect Christianity here is it what is this see turn fighting for God God can work so what he said you know the defense of the gospel the state was welcomed though there was no word for it so whatever is being done there must be a word for it so you have to get back to the scriptures because what a man'll came to reveal the scriptures the entering I said what a bounce a ball around said no he come to review this so what he said could go back into this give me a way better of it is that a mystery scripture a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed with a supernatural element over it despite the revelation but the first part is a mystery in Scripture so the defense of the gospel by the state was welcomed do there was no word for it and though we can see the wrath of man praising God in such a friends as henri de taking of the republic reformation and rejection of papal Authority it was a far cry from the truth of Pentecost and the protection of an omnipotent God in spite here we go in spite of looters constant teaching against the outside interference is local to its matters The ministers fight this they don't want this affinity of the local church they want bishops to take over and claim to be a fool as if God commissioned a bunch of mental pic overreaches that is bringing back Nicoletta and bringing back room all over again but in a modern way in a message we listen to what he said in in spite of ludus constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of Bishop Archbishop concept of church government does the church took one step in the right direction but remain shackled so in short she was imprisoned in the same dungeon when she attempted escape still the cup of our abominable works was not yet full not only Luther comport judgment inside the battle and thereby cause the death of multitudes but swingley party persecuted in the prison the godly dr. Hugh Maia and though it did not convert him to the stick it was actually responsible in great measure for his eventual death by sire house then did no less but remanded the arrest of Civitas who have been seen and taught the oneness of the Godhead the state then tried his brother and the Calvinist may even bring a distinct lies when they connected the government charge a big lemon church they heard boom and destroy could I go any further what was done if there ever a time of the nomination ordeal it was this tragic time the worth of convenience described much of his era and his route wanting needful and that's what I title is anything today once in visa he compares the world to a labyrinth which is a maze and modular weapon and shows that the way out here we go do we out the way out for your life right now this morning the ryote is to leave what is needless and choosing the one thing that is needful don't waste your time kill what is needless and begin to see what is needful what you need to do how you need to act what you need to say you take the side of what is needful isn't that right and choosing the one thing needful which Christ the great number of teachers he says is the reason of the molecule of sex for which we shall have so no more names left each church reckon itself as the true one or at least the purest Jewish part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with bitterness hatred no no reconciliation is to be hoped between them they meet enmity with irreconcilable enmity out of the Bible forged the different trees these are their fortresses and boulevards behind which they and change themselves and resist all attacks I will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases they are they are so that they are so bad in themselves they become so yeah why because in that they feed the fire of enmity only by putting them away altogether only by putting them are we all together would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church to the labyrinth of sex and various confessions others belongs the love of disputations which is argument the love of it love it some people love it the guy just listen and talk normal they have to argue de Geste l.o.v.e it what is obtained by it the question has a single learner strife ever been settled never the number has only been increased argument between husband 'likes and i going down the line they argue another argument rocket or a Zeppelin or baguette wait what does he wants a husband or you know already but for edification sake I will see it again husband love your wife wife respect your husband if your husband love you and you don't respect him how do I look dialogue go get bunks against that this is my girl and afterwards you love will fall short but if it work in harmony with the Scriptures you will see an improvement you would see a whole different thing altogether Satan I'm almost done Satan is the greatest sophist and that word sophist means color Mystica here splitter and I got a new word doctrine eeeh never heard of one before and the doctrine is somebody that is rigid inflexible unbending and dogmatic if you say someone is a doctrinaire or was a doctrinal attitude your disobey of six principles which is right of force on other people I believe it so and you should be so cool so you are Peter and I happen to be poor with different go Andrews Andrew Peter is Peter James and James is none right so watch season is the greatest sophist or scholar or doctrinaire oh yes paternity cur he at watch he has never been overcome in strength of words so don't take for one minute that you want to debate the devil no but I already said this is the thunder that shakes the devil what is it a live voice not mode voice not Dapitan voice a live voice that is the Thunder that gonna shake the devil is your life consecrated dedicate the god you can't say one word about that person so sweet so humble so we're living that's the thunder that shakes the devil Neverland senior multi feeling your spirit I want your vibes out isn't I rang so he has never been able to overcome in cyber words here we go in divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one chatez only pieces or kill time by linen disquisitions and that word means the beat speeches and Athene and disproven the view of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become a partaker of his divine nature second be the one for scarcely anything a said nothing is said about the virtues Bordeaux's rainbows about the life not entirely ending yourself but watch scarcely ending a said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of Beynon all the pollution remains the sacraments the symbols of unity of love and of our life in Christ have been made the occasion of bitterest conflict a course of mutual hatred SEC tourism in short Christendom might become a labyrinth which is a means a weber jungle the fear has been split into a thousand little parts and your leader heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only do only one thing needful return the Christ look at the Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps second aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the field regions for 13 as the heavenly father and the heavenly master built everything on the ground of the scriptures so shall we leave all particularities our special confession and be satisfied with the revealed Word of God which belongs to all of us with the Bible in our hand we should see we should cry I believe that God has revealed this book I will obediently keep his commands that I play holding this ole Miss's when I don't I hope for that which he has promised Christians can hear there's only one life but that comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one Christ but a toast Antichrist so don't know and so Christian them what is the one thing needful either the alternates back to Christ or your go to destruction of the Antichrist you go out wise a little you would follow the leader of life letter Stan [Music] hold it hold it why don't all Oh what I believe nobody was doing this [Music] [Applause] you [Music] Paul who claimed I pancake my [Applause] and transform came my way whoa whoa whoa to

never spit on a sidewalk I never crystal Bonnie I never had I'm in their eyes all of that is not this money though although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something's got to happen the new birth Oh hallelujah thought to happen is that is an experience it's something that takes place it's not talking about it it's not some new doctrine not some new form new theology or new idea no no no no no listen you said it's so it not that it frees it so it's not that that brings a new book them good things he said now the different churches they'd say well if you accept this or believe that then it's all right but it isn't he says now to begin with the base path the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us that we are all born in sin amen Bible teachers an image we are all born in sin there's none righteous there's none holy for honor nothing could you - or honor will ever come for anything oh we also get that out of your mind or there's none good there's none righteous hallelujah hallelujah when John was in the vision he look around who was ready to take a book who is ready to take the book their oven the proclamation was going out in their eyes and when you look around to the left there was nobody when you look to the right there was nobody when he look behind there was nobody the Bible said John wept because there was no man ready to take a look he weepy crime or on earlier it seemed hopeless the situation seemed on earlier forsaken for long or honor there was none worthy to take this book because in this book Lee his freedom in this booklet his right to be called the son of God and his book his ability to contact God and this book was the way back and this book hallelujah allowed us a connection back to God the inheritance the D the right Honoria was all in this book hallelujah and there was none worried to connect us back but somebody tap John on the shoulder and said don't weep John behold a line of the

book Oh hallelujah but he took it Oh halt in heaven hi John [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory glory do you see it now that's why we could worship Baal that's why we could praise cloth nothing good that we have done it brings up all of the same levels whether you are rich or poor whether you are born or free you needed Jesus I needed Jesus but he came and paid the price Oh on calories and he set us free oh you could worship the bridge cause you can come into his presence through the block [Applause] oh my oh my no hallelujah we are all born in skin shaped in iniquity and comment to this world speak in life except so they're not shoulder that our nature to begin with it's sinful to start with and we're no good to begin with so who are we anyway one time David said who is man that thou art mindful of him Who am I whoa Nelly and I could call myself anything I am nothing except for the grace of God I couldn't even stand here today if God did love me ah but you are here and we are here as hoping of His grace and as testimonies of the love of God that God will inch oh honey the rewarder of them that diligently seek it oh you'd have never made it it caught in that for you you don't never made it or if he didn't make a way for you this morning hallelujah honey that's what season oh man whoa how we are the praising how we ought to worship Him this kills self-righteous attitude this kills your pride this kills your human spirit who you are what you've accomplished you are nothing you have never been something if it wasn't for I so get that to yourself you are nothing oh it's a grace of God I call you it's a greater border brought you out it's a greater corner you have breath in your body this morning you could never worship what if it was a boy love if it wasn't for His grace if it wasn't for his mercy there are people who wish they could be where you are now oh they are found and change what's on a raise up of pride so go and break those change this morning Poosh are performing Oh hallelujah hallelujah was looking for people a man oh my I'm no good no good I need a wool eagle just like everybody else Peter Paul zing John all of them needed the Holy Ghost the same way they had to come to the same baptism he had to pay the same price Mary couldn't say when I gave birth to Jesus I have special privilege as though she had to receive the same Holy Ghost she had to get out same penny Oh Alleluia she had to pay the same price and all of us have got to pay the same price Rita fort Leslie fought on earlier because of fight also we've got to pay the same price Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Honoria whoa earlier you must be born again it's nice that we're no good to begin with so we cannot even claim anything is a profit now by all sweetness or as all sincerity or how great we are how little we are or whatever more we are altogether wrong to begin with and there is nothing at all that we can do about it you cannot jesus said who by taking thought can add one cubit is stature one measure to such a rather you can take all the thoughts do all the dreaming of it read it study it examine it and everything else and you can't help yourself one iota so that just throws it all out he said I'm so glad it does because if it's laid in the thought of knowing something or how smart we will see we poor illiterate people would be left out so we wouldn't have a chance but God change it or rather he said never had it that way in the beginning the churches have always make it complicated but God makes it simple oh the churches always make it complicated we have the man trying to explain a table as if in some four-legged structure a construct that neither blueprints Oh hallelujah and it makes it dependent on a man so the man has all the knowledge the man knows all the mysteries and you have to come to him to find out who God is but that's not the way God intended it God makes it simple for hallelujah so that you could see the vision and run with the vision whoa alleluia alleluia alleluia [Music] but God makes it simple so that it's brought down to a place where all of us can see it oh do you hear this morning all of us can have it it's for whosoever will and now not one man could see the other I love that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah not one man could see the other so now it makes no difference what anyone else tries to say no man could save another no matter how smart or what his office is let him be a pastor or priest a bishop or Cardinal our Pope he cannot have one thing to do with saving any man's life because he is a sinner himself born in sin shaped in iniquity coming the world speaking lies he's a liar to start with that's a strong word he's alive to start with and any word you would say would be alive if it was contrary to God's Word and God's plan but God made a plan here we go for man to be saved and man cannot add anything to that plan because it is oh oh he can't add anything to it that's why Moses couldn't save the people it took God to come down in a burning bush that was God's way of doing things Moses tried and you only kill one man a runaway for 40 years that's all man could do but when man come to the end of himself when you have nothing else to do when you have nowhere else to turn to that's when called Jepson that's when poor drops down won't any other because it's right in fourth time it's right in both order and you can't interrupt it Oh a many men in their eyes you can't add anything the god's plans cause plan and that's the plan that we are want to study this this morning what God's plan you said let every man's would be alive that might be true therefore we'd be danced to change one sentence or to make it something else no matter how much or rituals and so forth reads we've got to forget that this is God's Word just can't be done no other way what has a plan imagine alright okay second four inches tree says now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty oh there's freedom in our house this morning freedom to worship freedom to praise car Oh hallelujah praise God a Maronite the blood of Jesus sets you free from the law of sin intense human spirits woman seven is nice when you will you would not when you would do good evil is present with you but when you break over to Romans 8 we see the grace of Almighty God for the law the spirit of life in Christ Jesus is what sets you free from the law of sin and death it is what raises you up above how you feel above your fails above your shortcomings above your circumstance above who you want to be who you're trying to be praised ha hallelujah but we all will open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into that same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the law amen amen eleven okay I'm good here on what it takes to make a Christian life he says but in the word I find that God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ and I think in doing that with that in mind and in God's program we will never be successfully no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program where the Holy Spirit Oh Anna is the center of God's program Oh hallelujah Jesus at the center of it all oh I the center of every motion at the center of every decision every idea Oh hallelujah and the captivity to the word bar into the spirit upon hallelujah hallelujah that's wonderful with message last week that's why we ought to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit who honors so we are fighting this morning to live in that inspiration we are not fighting for some man's idea no no no we're not fighting for own ideas that every man's would be alive and that God would be true we want God's Word we want to raise the standard in this last day of the word in this hour Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory amen Oh mine please God he said now realizing that this is no new thing to preach on it's something that's been preached on many times but the way we approach it and the way we take it see we still we take it still thinking that that is the Holy Spirit control Church and yet we put my intellectuals mixed with it and then we get a conglomeration of both the Holy Spirit and intellectuals I know when the Holy Spirit desires to do a thing and degrade something or lift something up it causes petty jealousy among the people which proves that they haven't got the Holy Spirit every man would want to be in his place Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but over talk about a car on a race porn and manasseh wanna race corner everybody wanna raise corn to it you're not doing what God had for you to do what are you looking at somebody else and a man is now trying to do their lot all of you but when you find your place and you are effective in God's kingdom I'm brother Branham said I want my little finger to be there is that I want my little toe to be there every part is important to me and that's all God feels every part is important to him no matter how small a pop machine no matter how limited that pop machine quarter to lose it Oh hallelujah poise on us for his glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen we met nine oh my my where was I hallelujah praise God he says a petty jealousy and so forth okay amen every man wanted in this place right now in this the people has a reason because it seems so much in nomination so much different dictators as it was spiritual dictators and a church to see does endure but the Holy Spirit has placed each one into the party of Christ and here is what he said we are helpless to maneuver without every member of our body we have to have our we have to have my hands my arms my mouth my my eyes everything that's in me to operate to make my body function perfectly he said and then if God wanted his body the church to be governed by his spirit then he's got to have got to be some way or some program that we've got to enter into other than what we have already had he's another Bible today Zico speaking is equal to the prophet and he said a new heart I'll give you each an and I like it always brought speaking of something new that he's going to do he didn't say now that he will meant he just he didn't say he didn't mean that he will patch up an old condition that's not what we're talking about he's not going to take some old you and just put some power in it and seal it up no no no no put a little piece on it or put a little bandage on it human beings like to do that hallelujah put a plaster on it we'll think about it later put a bandage on it we'll think about it later that's not what we're talking about he said it's not a man he said it's not uh you say now a new heart I'll give you he didn't say he was a patch up an old condition but a new heart I'll give you and I'll take away the stony heart which you have and a new spirit will I give you oh no you never said he would give it a facelift in the old church he said he would have a new thing a brand-new thing behold I make all things new Oh hallelujah a new creation Oh hallelujah terra-that all flesh Tara not all hearts to Tara that all desire God's gonna perform excavation this morning God wants to take out all the old flesh take out all of your always all of your all ideas through the way you want it to be and how you want it to be forget about it praise God forget about your porch and you begin to comment Accords do program corn has away this morning he has a provided way this morning Oh hallelujah are you gonna have a new nature a new creation a new thing pulsating inside your heart the pillar of fire Oh hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right Oh Holley it's an experience it's something that comes inside Oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't all right pizza was a truncus all hot spot special man is not right because nobody if it was no good but yet brought Jesus calling said Peter compel it comes they walk with Jesus with you and a half yes didn't know who he was isn't that right oh honey I took a revelation from God dropped on your people's heart I'd say Paul at the price son of the Living boss Jesus turned to Peter I say passion blood has not revealed to you but my part in heaven every village we take pause to reveal to you who Jesus is that's vitally coming to church and doing nice things but beyond that the revelation there's a supernatural element that remains Oh hallelujah and Peter did all the right things Peter did some nice stuff Peter walked on water because brave Peter was outspoken holiday in a little hasty sometimes but he was a good brother Oh hallelujah hallelujah but still when the crunch time comes he denied Christ isn't that right he couldn't take his fan he couldn't do what was required of him in that taste and he knew it Jesus knew it so our air before the crows will deny me thrice jesus said you got to do these things but he said when you are converted strengthen the Brethren you means Peter walking with Jesus three and a half years and he is not converted no he still have something to get he still have something to receive he's still hard to be firebomb it has happened in his life he had to receive the thing yet but when Peter was in the upper room he was all praying there was always blue they were carrying in his name they were looking for something they were under expectations with something and then all of a sudden town from the dynamics and an anointing dropped on Peters ha the Bible said each one received a little pile whoa hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're looking for this morning it's more I come in a church but have you received you since you believe you come to church you pay attached but have you received food since you believe I don't care how good you are so the matter what could you do Oh hallelujah you need the Holy Ghost still need a person of Jesus Christ any your soul Oh alleluia alleluia alleluia Oh hallelujah [Applause] because I have it to give it you gotta have it to show the token has a gone public display it's not just talking about it but the person of Jesus because the Holy Spirit is not fought but around for the Holy Spirit is a person it is an actual person with behavior and with characteristics and with a lightness there's a way that he talks there's a way that he walks there the way that he does things and we have to come into that program we haven't seen that yet but that is what we need in the church one more time is the person of Jesus in the brother in the sister in the Deacons any illness in the passes in the minister the person of Jesus to forgive and to love and to reach out as a help and to strengthen and to edify Oh says we would see Jesus we come all this way but we need Jesus one more time we need Jesus in every heart we need Jesus in every life we need Jesus and every soul we need Jesus walking in on this Oh Holly we are and we are oh yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] his nature his being how he lives how he walks with people with what we've seen in this message we have not seen Jesus we have seen spread of man's do what they want say what they want find the churches find the people with intellect and ideas and this and that but sirs we need to see Jesus one more time it was Jesus in the Apostles when Ananias and Sapphira coming to church lied Peter said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost and they were shocked ed is now right but upon him sending a message he said we're going to have another Ananias and Sapphira us and a few of them he said then we'll it's what wore off say God's will be missing but church will be moving in its mighty power Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah as a board to up down in his awesome power we've seen blessings here and there but we haven't seen God in its fullness yes coming to the church and I remember one time they were spending some rumors of something about Moses I think isn't that right Aaron amen and Miriam I think it was was brought before the pillar of fire the answer for what has taken place they had a problem Moses his wife and I think the superior or dropped down and shot leprosy upon hand Moses pleaded before God hallelujah to not despair and so on and and then God told him I let her go to the camp about seven days or so and then come back isn't that right that's corn in his judgment that's quad for Cillian righteousness that God fulfilling bringing his church bringing his people into a level of holiness we haven't seen that yet Oh hallelujah Halloween happen one of these days it's gonna switch over or it's gonna sit in the throne of the hearts of man Oh hallelujah hallelujah uncharged uprightly and judge in righteousness people come to church halfway people come when they want to people come how they want to but you haven't seen part in its fullness yet Oh hallelujah Oliver when

nothing mayors have prostrate before God I let you tile to yourself Oh hallelujah stand there praise God like Samson and said let me time with my Philistines I don't wanna time I don't to live no more but I want to see Christ live in me Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he-man hallelujah he said Jesus oh it's not a faceless hallelujah is that Jesus taught the same thing in Luke when he said you kind of put new wine into old bottles you can endow it sometimes hard for me to understand before they came a missionary generated clothes he said to see what bottles and so forth in air oh I thought well the bottle what we call a bottle it would just wouldn't get all the glass bottles regular bottles did your custom to see but in a Palestinian country and during this time especially the bottle the bath then was an animal that had to be tanned and so up and tied up in places see and the skin contained a liquid and so forth they put it in water wine and oils and what they carried in the skin now when the skin became old well it was dry and when Jesus is speaking put new wine in old bottles they would both perish you would lose your wine and lose your bottle now you might be able to put water in an old bottle but you can't put wine into an old bottle because water is the ashes of hydrogen and oxygen which remains and so forth if anything it windows the way it shrinks its substance of water that is has no life but it is still see ashes and so on and as onaji explains it he said but wine has life in it and wine what new wine especially it's fermenting yet in other words it's still moving it's still fermenting it's still expanding his all right and he said it might spread out a little and he said if it goes to pushing in the old bottle and he all dry hide it will burst and fly open now that he said and then the height is ruined and the bottle is see the bottles ruined the wine is spilled he said now that stuff about the picture we have before us today you can come to an old form a bunch of intellectuals and your ideas and try to adopt God's program into your intellectual program he said it just won't work the old Reich are hide will just blow up because it can take it he said but now a new bottle here we go he said is a new hand high he said in a new town heart still has the animal oil in the hand he said and then when I knew I'd goes into that new bottle and then when the new wine begins to swell the new bottle kids and the new bottle pushes out because it's got oil in it Oh alleluia alleluia so we looking for new parcels this morning we don't want no all halle-loo bottles of your mind can't do this and can't do that no no no no I knew how to give you a new spare I'll put within you a new bottle new wine hallelujah hallelujah with life inside of it something moving inside of its water move inside of you and expand a little put your knowledge I begin to expand and expand on that new Potter to begin to kill to the life of Jesus Christ or if God wants to add to your fate you can expand a little more that's what God's looking point is our Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah whoa then we get to take one another form then if you get to swell a little and what's inside of you gets bigger it gets better it begins to look more like Jesus left like the world and more like Jesus we will begin to take notes that you had been with Jesus not just talking about it but your life begin to express something that you have been with Jesus that you have spoken about Jesus that you were there when the pillar of fire touch you you were there when cause it's only for you then you become a witness of God hornier [Applause] whoo hallelujah oh my hallelujah I'm almost finished and it ever was a time when the church needs an oil in its today a Holy Spirit oiling new wine and now when the Bible said Jesus is the same yesterday and forever his healing powers just as great to be as it ever was and the oil intellectuals would blow up there's a no such thing dr. John said that the days of miracles is past that settles it but when new wine is put in a new bottle completely softly and then when it begins to ferment the life begins to work in from the old out psychology that we used to study and then we see the Word of God in its divine promises instead of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the new wine would say hallelujah your bottle will say glory to God spell out give room that's what we get Oh hallelujah hallelujah the 11:00 this morning whoo hallelujah never eat something quick a before we close Susie will see Jesus he said a Holy
