once thus shall doubt do six days and seven presa Bethea before the ark seven trumpets of the ram's horns and the seventh day he shall come pass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with that rhymes with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout on the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him and I want to skip down to verse 9 and verse 9 says and the armed man went before the priest that blue with the trumpets and the river and the reward came after the Ark and the priest going on and blowing with the trumpets and Joshua her commander of people saying ye shall not shout no make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you to shout then shall ye shine amen don't got up less room is good let's just bow heads now Heavenly Father

everyday Brom went on was another day closer to Isaac it was a day closer and you are they closer to the dynamics you are they closer to the holy knows you art a closer one day closer we are one

one day you're gonna walk right into that hospital room and one day the rainbows are gonna be all around you one day you're gonna walk in there and watch the devil scream but Oh hallelujah they know they're just waitin on one word from you because cord is inside whatever you see calls because the authority of code we failed or I'll end up topped it sons of God hallelujah hallelujah not man's ministry but the Holy Ghost whoa let me drop this off here real quick and closer Moses had a mighty ministry is now the people sauce hands people so honest the people saw miracles the people saw that that danger passed through people saw plagues and flies frogs all manner of things it was untouched undoubtedly that God was among this this man caught Moses God made us it's distinctly and clearly identified himself with this man hallelujah is neurons and this mighty ministry was so powerful in that thing that it proved the very arms of hero so much sort of fear himself with his own mount said take a cattle take your people take your flocks take whatever belong to you I don't want to see you I don't want to hear you I don't want to look at you because your fixation to me take your people and call when the devil get so fed up of a bride marching in step of a pride marching in power when you begin to flex your real muscles I'm talking about your fake muscles I'm talking about your natural muscles no no I'm talking about your fake muscles oh seven thunders give pitch to call for the power I'll put you power to live this Christian thing yeah when the devil she's - we gonna give him a run for his money we're gonna run him out of town we're gonna run him off our land we got a running plumb out of the church oh he won't have anybody to hold no more he won't have anybody to use for more oh I like the devil will be bound for a thousand years because he won't have no party to use only if you could use me Lord use me I'm longing for the tail there's gonna come a church it's gonna come up people they're gonna be used by God mine party and soul so coated over with the Spirit of God Oh hallelujah one word from God he'll go cause if he caught failing them it's not right amen let me keep on now two and a half million people come on Egypt out of this powerful ministry that Moses had and after all I was done and so time would come for God to switch over and here was that Moses had brought them out but he couldn't bring them in and God knew that two and a half million people coming out he wasn't gonna go in because of their unbelief yeah come so far up to the promised land that was promised to their fathers I was promised a lot of possession a land flowing with milk and honey a land flowing with good things I'll and flew in with wonderful promises a land flowing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a land flowing with signs wonders and miracles a land flowing with all the promises of God in reality in a manifestation something you could see and taste just like grapes Oh hallelujah hallelujah but because our the unbelief it couldn't go on it's not right I'm just pop raising this story here unless we come down to the end we see Moses is passed away and God didn't take a coffee break God didn't take a vacation go all those longing to see his children come into the place where there won't be wet always belong into their position into their authority into the police he always had it in his mind for them God said Moses my 7 is 10 now therefore take the people over no time to wait no time come on let the dead bury the dead but this caravan is moving on we've got a revival to see about Oh hallelujah oh we've caught a hallelujah we've got a sec the hill we've gotta tell to me race we gotta plan to see hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] onami hurry on quick so mooses ministry switched over to Joshua after the death of Moses God told Joshua said moves myself isn't there now therefore arise and go over this Jordan down all these people onto the land I do give them even to the children of Israel and every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon God have I given unto you as I said unto Moses so footprints means possession you are not possessing anything until you put your foot on it you are not really possessing anything until you've been there until you've tasted the grapes until it's a reality you can claim anything or you can't clean any ministry unless called him unless you are possessive hallelujah in the real and truest sense there's got to be some evidence of called moving in and out among the people there's got to be some evidence somebody's got to happen something's gonna take place it's got to be proven scripturally before you could clean anything [Music] so Joshua meditate day and night so now Joshua on a strike this heal quick is the Old Testament and the Old Testament he's in am either a man that we're talking about is now right this man called Joshua but in Ephesians perilous Joshua is now and Joshua is actually the Holy Spirit is now in the book of Joshua is now right the Holy Spirit is actually being depicted as a great warrior Joshua as a great warrior spirit whoa overcoming spirit he is the one that's leading the charge and checking his instructions from the unseen captain himself he's a great warrior how the Holy Spirit is a great warrior a great warrior just like Joshua was that's what His Holy Spirit is today so when God was finished with Moses he didn't none trust the church really to a man but that church has now has been entrusted in the hands of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the endtime leader that was sent to take the people over and the place the people positionally in the promised land and the Old Testament it was a man but in Hell right in this Asia now right in his Ephesians time right in this pride age the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the same place the people positionally yeah it from here back up in here the Holy Spirit no longer mine I hear me tonight God use a man as a shadow or type in the Old Testament but in the New Testament we cross over and we see the power brother Branham points our eyes to the Holy Ghost so now that endtime leader is not a man it's not some ministry it's not on five for ministry it's not some dis or some that but it's the Holy Ghost in the Apostle or Holy Ghost in the pasta and the teacher it's what we be doing the work and tonight we need a Holy Ghost back in the church the Holy Ghost and the young people it'll make you walk straight it'll make you a crutch it'll make you say the right things it'll make you do the right thing it'll make you jump it'll make you shout it'll make you pray it'll make you go on your knees and I'll make you scream and I'll make you cry the Holy Ghost will change the way you want it'll change your nature it'll change how you worship it'll change how you approach a service no more dead services and now you're alive unto God now you're on fire for Jesus because not only does the holy olio in your life somebody praise them [Applause] [Music] all right I'm running away two minutes and I'll strike it this great warrior Joshua he knows no retreat he knows no surrender there are no prisoners with this great warrior Joshua when the devil I took wall is running for all these years when the Holy Spirit is ready to ride his trail one more time the devil better get out the way tonight because God is getting ready shall ride his trail one more time two hundred thousand Thousand Devils God's gonna cut a path clear true this Red Sea tonight you are gonna go free your children are gonna go free every young person gospel will be preached in its power [Applause] hallelujah listen listen Joshua speaking to the priests city Kaliyuga covenant I'm passing for the people watch and it took up the Ark of the Covenant I went before the people I love the scripture here let me read a crate he said on the Lord said unto joshua this day when I begin to magnify he and all the sight of Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so would I be with t this is a beautiful scripture tonight because when we when we look a remark I for said then we see that Joshua represent a holy spirit there's gonna come a time when the Ministry of the word is gonna switch over to the Ministry of the Spirit and the Holy Spirit it's gonna be so magnified before the people that all fate will be inspired and all confidence will be fully in the leading of the Holy Spirit and his ability to lead us through the wilderness his ability to lead us through the trial to the testing to the persecution don't he slay me yet I trust him the Holy Spirit glory be to God the leading of the Holy Spirit not looking for any man more after the Prophet but just like the Prophet said Joseph in a Hebrew means Savior and he represents a promised endtime leader to take the church over and Caleb represents that true believer who stayed with Joshua oh and that's who you are tonight you are a true believer oh you wouldn't take no for an answer you didn't take the devil's lie in the beginning and we're gonna kick him out donkey as well whoa I ain't meant every word a meant every word I'm almost finished so our confidence is supposed to grow and the Holy Ghost ability to lead the church just as he did with the prophets the prophets that he waited on his office and he said you know what I'm waiting or I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord amen he didn't do nothing without a danger and the Holy Spirit will go everywhere with us when that dynamics time comes the leader Church hallelujah a man going everywhere confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles isn't that right that bride waiting for life to come to her god of a civil age but in obedience this is a feat woman that lives by faith the bride person here here he said Oh somewhere else he said some other church some other domination it's not somewhat up he said but believes the Word of God obediently waiting in love for the promise of the age should be confirmed she is waiting for it she is part of that word and she is waiting for her life to manifest that were pressuring can you see it he said I hope that didn't go over you he said the party is waiting which is a word waiting for a life which is a spirit to confirm or make it alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there and she knows that it's going to happen and then there happens the prophet section wakes up he said God let there be he said she'd comfort just like the first one come forward josè Joshua but attacks here quick he was waiting on instructions just for the Holy Spirit how Donna lo use commanded to do and they say we turn on instructions and the Prophet said he said no let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the Promised Land coming in sight he said it's narrowing the time to be given Joshua no Hebrew means Savior and so on he said Caleb represents a true believer God started Israel as a virgin with his word but he wanted something different so did the last day church he said but notice how God and move on with Israel until his own appointed time he said now listen it's gonna be something Joshua waited for that time no matter how much the people said God give us a land God promised now let's go and take it they might have said that Joshua lost your commission you're washed up what are you doing but he said you used to know they'll see the Lord and so on he said but this wise God sent prophets near the promise of God but also knew how to wait for that promise clear-cut decision from God for his time see these powers now watch he said I went a time come God give it to Joshua who stayed with him by the word and he could trust all others he couldn't trust others but he could trust him and so will it repeat amen hallelujah so God's gonna have a last day Brian that has the ability to wait I say wait on the Lord wait until hallelujah at a time appointed through it Terry wait for it it shall surely come to pass and Joshua waited and he waited on his office until all of a sudden you come an angel and an angel say take off your shoes and Joshua pull out his sword and see other force against us and I didn't just say no and I'm the captain of the Lord's hosts oh honey I'm here to show you how to take over and he told him walk around jericho once for six days but on that seven day when i pity - shouts genuine shouts in other words keep your silence don't worry about anybody the preacher what I want to preach they saying what they want to say huh let the gainsayers talk but when I pity - shouts that's when you're gonna shout let them run ahead let them mock let them laugh you ain't got none to show you ain't got no sign for holy a peace but when I pick it up then you will shout I went Joshua commanded of people all the people rose up and they shouted with a great shout and the walls come falling down brother tonight I believe God's gonna break the silence oh yeah in your life get ready get ready 20 18 God's getting ready to break the silence blow a trumpet in Zion god bless you finish Loreena

same forever can the church see man I don't have a title and he's have an inspirational text and it's the end of the walk the end of the war and I'm taking it from a corporate but the Branham said you know in this warfare between nations there's a great warfare going on beyond that and that's a warfare between God and Satan a great warfare that was the first warfare and it's still raging but oh I'm so glad it'll soon come to an end and that's what I want to speak about tonight the end of the war this war that started way back way back in heaven when Lucy four raised up because he wanted worship but Michael the Minister of Defense in heaven said he was not having it and there were some angels that were representing us that stood with Michael and the war that was a war of angels became a war of Menem and that war existed in Genesis it existed in Leviticus it existed in numbers and went to Deuteronomy it was the Anna book of Joshua it was there in the books of Kings it was the in the books of Samuel and now that war is still raging but it is gonna come to an end that war has been running for a long time rahama fell victim to that war just one fell victim to that war that war brought death that war brought pain that war brought heartache that war brought marital war that war bored warm your body war in your minor war in your spirit a people brother branham reached up with in the heavenlies and he looked at the whole chess play of God and said I'm so glad that war is about to come to an end I see the ending of your suffering I see the end of your depression I see the end of your frustration I see the end of what the devil took from you he has got to let it go you may be seated for a minute I greet you tonight in the precious name of Jesus I'd like to acknowledge the presence of our pasta in the house god bless you beloved welcome back he is tired he's weary but he made it to the house of God tonight god bless you were over I want to salute the believers in Merrell who I believe are connected the water cut them off the devil tried to stop this service he tried to stop me from coming to the message he's trying to stop you from getting the Holy Ghost but it's too late the war is coming to an end we serve notice tonight you may be seated I was having a conversation today about land and I see if you leave people on land for too long they can make a claim on the land and the devil has a squatter he has been there for a very long time but it comes a point where there's a little bit of time when he's been there for so long but it's even if you don't take action you can make permanent claim on the land so I be tonight we have come to take action and a few minutes are left to see Satan get off of my property get out of my body get out of my mind out of my house as for me at my house we want to serve the Lord now listen you may be seated I don't by anybody telling me the attire because there are people leaving home right now to have New Year's party I don't know where they got party from but party is when there's music and their celebration and there's joy de plátanos taught because it was party in heaven where was Tom when I laid a

more it means an athletic team has got to go [Music] glory to God you may be seated for a minute can I get a little more the monitors please thank you so against all odds you are here tonight against all odds when all hell was against you because it's never did everything he could do in his power to stop you but the Branum said you didn't even find a message God had to bring the message to you against all odds you grew up in the Baptist Church you grew up in the Methodist Church you didn't grow up in church and it was not by your put into our family but something in your soul was connected to something bigger than yourself there are people tonight who I hear because it's a ritual to them in their mind it's a ritual but you couldn't come here tonight unless there was a seed in your soul or you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me tonight because you are not in control you are not in control of your future he is the one who was controlling everything he said I am alpha and I'm the Omega I'm the beginning and the end turn every page I'm there in the middle of your trial I'm there David short is here too I make my bed in hell he is there it doesn't matter - ten thousand four oh you know hear me you may be seated I said it last week he attributes but the Jonathan that's locked up in God it's not for himself he doesn't need to be healed because he cannot get sick he doesn't need to be raised up because he doesn't get depressed oh you don't hear me tonight huh so the attributes that locked up and called to him to pour out to somebody God cannot get crippled so his ability to heal the is not for himself I don't care you can in mine crippled and body crippled and spirits and mate that same Jesus is the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever Oh hallelujah oh I'm getting ready to close out I'm - Liam I'm gonna be long hallelujah but it's against all odds in the Bible in the Book of Jeremiah 29 it says what thus saith the Lord in verse 10 that after seventy years we accomplished at Babylon I will visit you in other words after a period of time existed in your life of uncertainty after a period of time that existed in your life of whatever trouble you went through in this year or whatever period of time we're talking about he said I will visit you and perform my good would - what you he's not performing something to you that you didn't hear before he's performing his word to you in causing you to return to this place so I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil so when you are in his mind he is not thinking of punishing you he's not thinking of evil towards you but is to give you an expected end in other words at the end of your story he knows how it's gonna end and no devil no demon no sickness no boss no neighbor no lack of money no whatever it is will stop you from your expected end [Applause] and this is where changes in your life then shall ye call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places with the I am driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive turn to your neighbor and said timeout devil the war is ending the war is ending tell your other neighbor the war is ending the war in my house is ending the war in my family is ending the war my party is ending but a war bypass is ending the devil bring back my battles that war is ending the devil brings depression that war is ending the devil give your female condition that war is ending you have husband problems war is ending you have y problems war is ending mummy problems war is ending because he is your hova Tyrel he is a home Arafah he is your over Niecy halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah [Music] I'm not going to be too much longer so everything in your life has been the odds are stacked against you because his strength listen carefully is made perfect in our weakness so God is a jealous God he doesn't want to share glory with anybody so when you are strong and you are Baal and you go out there and do it your way he gets no glory but you see when you are weak then his strength can be made perfect he loves it when your back is against the wall and he gives you grace to move on that's what allows you to worship when you're all else is wrong you can worship anyhow because it's his strength you know when you lift your hands it's not your strength but it's his strength because he kept you alive to see this thing he kept you alive to see 2018 he provided and he will provide because you belong to him Oh hallelujah oh my hallelujah hallelujah God had a plan for Joseph and Joseph had his dream and everything but then he was sold into captivity and it seemed as if all was against him how does a man who is connected to God find himself locked up in prison find himself thrown there with people who we didn't expect to be with but when all else was against him God is working his way out God puts them in Potiphar's house and he again all hell comes against him he's minding his own business he didn't go after Potiphar's wife she came after him he ran for his life situation after situation came through but what was it God is working as well because what God was to push him into position and for him to get into position he has to go to trials and situations and false accusations and lies and declarations all of that was necessary because he could only be effective in his position he could helpless people when he was doing water streaming by himself but when he was put at the right hand of Pharaoh no he's in position to do what God wanted him to do so every trial every test every situation every lie every accusation every problem you have had was to push you into position that our God could use you oh my mother close out Samson Samson losses here Samson lost his joy Samson losses victory Samson could look back to when he was on fire for God he could look back over the years to when God was with him but in that moment just before the war ended Samson found himself reminiscent thinking back to when the lion attacked him and he don't know where his strength came from but his strength came from somewhere else because it was not in him it was not in us it was not mine over matter but something came over him have you ever had that something comes over you your back is against the wall and and you can remember that ins and something is remembering one time they cage him and all hell was against him he also against him but he took to get and not just move Decatur he put it on a hill so they need a crane and they need a team to bring it back it's easy to talk about the past but the random said is he easy to talk about the future but he said the treatment of God talk about the gore of now the core of the present tense and something there stood be in his cell and as he's thinking back to when the power of God rose over him just then he hears the gates open and a young boy says Samson it's time to go the people are waiting for you and in that moment something in his heart brother Branham said he saw a possibility he saw a possibility that God could work for him one more time he saw a possibility that he could access the same power that he felt once before you could not be here tonight unless you felt a power once before and Samson in his heart as he was ladies it take me to the pillars take me in other words I want to be in position my blessing cannot come unless I'm in position they have to be in the upper room they have to be in position and when Samson stood he said Lord let me die with the Philistines and if I have a prayer for you tonight it's that we die with 2017 we die to the feelings and emotions and desires on the complaints it's your choice what you carry into 2018 you cannot blame the devil for what happens in 2018 because you could cut him off you could cut him off tonight you could cut off the devil oh I know something you don't even get that but the Bible said resist the devil and he will flee that's the problem in the church we have been entered here in the devil but the Bible says resist him and when you push back he's got to go he has no power when you push him back o Europe [Applause] I'm about to close stop giving the devil coffee stop trying to be a gentleman with the devil it's a war kick him out kick him out tonight I said it before it's not my outrageous and you're all you know my batters what is not yours send it back to the devil see Satan keep it in 2017 not 2018 this year is my year the year of my regime has come I'm leaving as righteous in 2017 um and you gonna speak it he clear it and walking it and say once more Lord restore my joy restore my peace restore my victory I'm closing out so the odds were against David the odds were against the Hebrew boys the odds were against Moses and God stepped into each situation to work his way out by the same Holy Ghost that was there and in our day the odds were against Jesus to even be born where he was supposed to be born so God allowed a lot to be changed and made it hard but everything was the line of her purpose to get him into position the odds work ends the prophet he didn't have the education he didn't have the resources but the odds were against him but yet still God allowed a message to make it to a people and the odds have been against you for your whole life because the devil doesn't know who you are the same way listen if the devil didn't know who Jesus was you think he knows who you are he acts Jesus if thou be and he was hoping that Jesus give him an answer but there are some things that we ought to keep secret so Jesus didn't pull out a business card and say yes I am I am the one no that was not Jesus when the devil asked him a question in God's heart he said that answer is not for him and when they never try to get the response from Jesus Jesus it is written his response was it is written when he keeping anything it is written he say it is also written and brother Branham said it was like an electric volt hit the devil and the devil went away for a season the devil for the first time we took a serious vacation since even because the word is powerful by itself and this is a secret brother branham said the word is in the bride and the word is the conductor of the Spirit so when the pure word is in your soul and you claim it as yours all it takes is the Holy Ghost to drop down and use you as an instrument and then the devil is finished because it's word and spirit together that's what what the Anthony's talk about we have been under the ministry of the world for all these years but now the Ministry of the Spirit in 2018 I'm under expectation to see God move like he's never moved before we will not always be having services like these friends we're gonna have services where people are walking and they'll be healed yes very anointing where we will not lay hands on the sick there'll be no dead believers in that church if you are dead the Holy Ghost will resurrect you because that's the season we are moving into so I'm not worried I'm not confused I'm not afraid I'm not sad or depressed what depression you're talking about the devil is depressed tonight because you made it you made it the 2018 you made it to your destination you made it to the end of the war [Music] hallelujah if not you then who if not now then when you have to make up your mind to tell the devil enough is enough you have run your race for a long time Sanka wasn't there after Jesus came and poured out the Holy Ghost on their Pentecost he was there any Old Testament and he told himself every year every year when I plant and I reap the philistine come and take my blessing I am tired of seeing my children not have food off of my labor I prayed outside I've cried it's time to do something different but the Branham said Sangha was a farmer he said he might have been enough cover all you don't want em jumpers you don't see people where that's anymore but the random describes Shimon I was having a jumper and he says I'm gonna look around for the only teeka define it was a UPS cord but the pranam said doctor isn't a weapon it's used to push a to keep moving but when shunga look at the Ox code and look at the Philistines could you imagine if their eyes made for those fellows I see that man has got to be crazy the odds were against him but he didn't look at the situation he didn't look at the problem in look at the enemy and brother branham said he attacked them didn't a get chance to attack him he attacked them and brother branham said he beat them all now listen you know what makes this beautiful shunga was not a soul here he was a left right left push up push up no he was a farmer he understands Ivan celery and pumpkin but when it comes time for war and I say it's time for war oh you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me tonight so I'm calling the farmers I'm calling them mamas I'm calling the fathers I'm calling the children because God will make warriors out of you he will make soldiers out of you I'm trying to close out but this thing is too good the odds against you it's something else you see and that's what the problems are some of us you know we have had it too easy so but the brown said lightly sizzle if love doesn't get you desperate then conditions will when you analyze some guy's testimony for years he was tolerating it you know it had to come to a point where he said you know what I fed up it was not an overnight decision he made it was built up over time like a pressure cooker he taken pressure he take him strain until it came to a point that's why the purpose of the whole creation it's grueling it's true feeling not one years two years it's treason it's years since since Adam lost the book the whole creation know something not right and we're getting ready for a big explosion but whenever there's an explosion I'm trying to close out something's got a spark the explosion there's gotta be something that ignite it has to be what is calling in science but a Steven correct miracle a catalyst is this a right word a catalyst is so many triggers brother George and when the catalyst is activated then it becomes a chain reaction so you can put gunpowder there and the Kanpur is sitting on the air brother Anthony normal but you like a matches and put it next to the Gunpowder but a George you know what happens all the people in the church who does be dead when the Gunpowder come and contact with the fire there is no devil no fire extinguisher there's no force that could stop the explosion you could try to contain it listen when fire and gunpowder come together you have two options you either explore with it or your run for cover and I believe one of these things is 16 elements its prophesy to be not necessary anymore the change from motel to immortality so when this world is destined for fire these elements can handle any pressure because we're going to be changed before that time come I don't plan to be running for cover I plan to be part of the catalyst we will cause the explosion to happen I'm closing out I'm done I'm closed I'm finished but the random said if you can't have fit for a toothache for divine healing how can we have faith for the rapture so by deductive reasoning if a plus B equals C it means we can reverse-engineer a and B so it means that if we have to have fit for the rapture and fit for divine healing is a less of it it means that along the journey we have to see miracles along the journey we have to see the dead in the church raised up we have to see the blind eyes pop open and be encouraged Jesus I'm closing you could play something softly Jesus is their ministering and he meets a blind man the Bible says he meets the blind man and he deals with them and grandma gets heeled and the disciples Aksum who sinned that this man could be in this condition is it his mother his father his grandfather who he said this is not even about that he is in this condition that the works of God could be glorified and sometimes we think Lord it's only me in this position and why me and God assume you are blessed that I've chosen you to manifest my glory because God cannot open the blind eyes unless somebody is who was blind God cannot heal a unless there's somebody who is crippled so no matter what situation you are in tonight take courage and take fit that he who predestinated you is more than able to bring you to your expected end and the purpose of God will never be discouraged the purpose of God will never be stopped so Church of the Living God happy new year may God bless you in 2018 beyond your measure as David said may your cup run over may your cup run over tell your neighbors get blessed tell your family get blessed may this year God fill you with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire even till charity the bond of perfectness may you add the food using me seal seal you into the kingdom of God may his life be expressed in you and may this be the greatest time you have ever had as a Christian now listen there'll be rough moments there'll be tough moments even Jesus had his own rough moments he cried at the grave of Lazarus but when he said Lazarus come forth he showed he was more than man and I'm looking in this room tonight and I'm seeing modern man I'm seeing what manner of man is this because God has called you for such a time as this Church of the Living God he is the same
