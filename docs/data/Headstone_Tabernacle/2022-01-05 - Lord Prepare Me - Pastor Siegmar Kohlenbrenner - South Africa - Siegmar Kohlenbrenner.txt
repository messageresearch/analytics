deeds that i've done i want them to be all to the glory and honor of god there's many of the things as i we're approaching the new year that i i wish i could could forget about but i know that i've confessed them as wrong to him and and he put them in the sea of forgiveness and he will never remember them no more now see we're not made that way we'll always remember we can forgive one another but we we can't forget about it because we are we are we are made different but god can forgive it and forget it he can just wipe it out as though it never was see because he has access to that sea of forgetfulness but we don't just think of it that god cannot even remember [Music] my sins by the blood of the land of calvary [Music] he hath forgiven me [Applause] praise god you appreciate though

original faith that's restored hallelujah and brother that message spoke for itself and you could see the unity at the end of the meeting and having the ministers come up here brother you know the manifestation is going to be the interpretation and you know sometimes this word that we preaching about has to go into action it's not always going to remain a word brother it's going to become an action and it's going to become an action in each and every one individual's life see that word come to pass be able to forgive and i like what he said there loving forgiveness forgiveness and love goes together you can't have faith and say you love your brother or you love your brother but you you love god you say you love god but you you can't love your brother you haven't seen god but you've seen your brother and you can't love him or forgive him but brother theo those words must come to pass it was prophesied by the prophet messenger and it's going to be manifested in this last day pride

five said look at that and i made a statement i don't know why i made this statement i said i don't know what i'm going to be preaching but i will not be preaching what i've been preaching now that's a statement for a pastor standing in front of this congregation saying they say you can imagine what happened i knew what i had wasn't sufficient i knew what i had wasn't enough to sustain me i knew that i needed more and this message came in came into my life amen and i was willing brother to lose my whole church for this message and i knew nothing about her i never read a spoken word book never heard a tape of brother branham you know i knew nothing about the best my wife was reading the books these the old spoken word books you know she would be very at night reading these books and i would say honey you better put them books down and get your bible she said no this is the word i said no i'm going to stick with the bible [Laughter] but she kept praying for me so you coming i said i i

message of the hour amen until the lord come back and get us amen so god bless you may god bless you appreciate that brother wesker my what a blessing my uh the holy spirit touched him i remember back in those early years and uh brother robledo i think the first message brother wisco preached was speak the word only you remember that message speak the word only after he just came out of the pentecostal church came into the message in new york there and i think brother coleman had him speak and his message was speak the word only don't speak nothing else i don't know about this group and that group speak the word only so god bless you brother weskel and to see him still standing after all these years and uh been a real pioneer for this message and we trust that god will continue to bless him and give him strength so this time it's my privilege to welcome a very faithful friend brother sigma colin brenner my what can we say about brother sigma he's been such an inspiration in this message is a man that loves god's people he's a man that loves the message and man if the like brother says always man has always supported him brother branham if there's ever a man that supported this message his brother colin sigma azigma colin brenner and we want to welcome him his precious wife there we're so glad you came with cesarean first time in south africa and we're so glad

his heart god bless you for the sigma [Music] lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] pure and holy [Applause] to right and true with thanksgiving with thanksgiving i'll be a living sanctuary [Music] lord prepare me to be a sanctuary i want to be pure and holy to right and true and with thanksgiving i'll be a living for you sanctuary for you [Music] [Music] father we thank you so much said we can come to you and ask whatever is laid on our hearts and we just we are asking you prepare me to be a sanctuary for you and father you told us also through your son jesus christ when we pray we have to believe what we pray we have to believe that we will have this answer and we believe we will be a sanctuary for you we thank you for it take over now this little service here and this afternoon in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated hallelujah praise the lord now i'm not such a thunderbolt like brother oh it's this morning and but i everyone after the gift of jesus christ in his heart and so we are different but one thing brother obi i appreciate this this morning it was like a fresh wind came in when you said i'm not in south africa i'm in heavenly places that was set was from your heart and i like this this is where we are where we should be we should be in a place where there is no sin no sickness no trouble no filthiness and god sees this world like this and we should see it the same way it's this few is called the kingdom of god and we were born again we are in it brother branham said i'm since 33 years i'm in heavenly places and i never came out listen he said i never came out i checked myself and i have to do some repentance because this is something he said i never come out and have the confidence i said i will never come out in my life so he lived in that in that realm and peter and all of them first disciples they lived in that realm no demon could come into israel where they lived that was the presence of god with them all the time so praise the lord and i also enjoyed my son was showing me the video clip where i've said all the pastors came in front and uh and identified themselves we says let me read the scripture my title is lord prepare me and the scripture is found in chain saint john 17 24 and revelation 20. 22-20 saint john 17 verse 24 and she and here jesus says he is praying and remember you shouldn't even pray when you don't believe what you pray and just pray lord prepare me we shouldn't do this it's a prayer we pray we are singing it and we we believe he will prepare us and so jesus he believes what he is praying listen what he is praying father i will that they all also whom thou has given me be with me and where i am that they may behold my glory which so has given me for thou loves me before the foundation of the world and just before he said it is not only for them for these my disciples but also for them that will hear the word through them for them it is also and he prayed also for you and for me and his prayer will be fulfilled hallelujah and and if you get catch the inspiration this is not when the doctor says it's all finished this is for right now for this life to be with him all the time to have him with us all the time so we don't have to be scared and fear anything in jesus name god bless you you may be seated so praise praise the lord [Music] remembrance goes back to 1981 in december we were i think it was pretoria first pretoyah first and i have a special remembrance there brother coleman preached a message says speak to the rock and we have a quote also that i will mention after from speak to the rock and but what really touched me what i have in my remembrance was a song that sister gail was singing as a special and she was singing that was 37 years ago on the platform this song it sounds like this if i really have it in my remembrance make me pure make me clean this is a prayer so that you might be seen make me a blessing lord wherever i would be this is some part that i remember sister gail now eight weeks later i was in the hospital in intensive care with a diagnosed heart attack for three days laying there this song always day and night day and night been through me all the machines around me brother's sister whenever you sing a special thing from your experience you may not know what will happen what will be happening to these believers that are listening to the voice of an experience we have to become more sincere because the third pull has to do something with sincerity and with your heart it was sister heidi wright she spoke from the heart it was this brother look and uh these prosthesis fishes you know where the fish was come back to life they spoke to one another said we should go to this lady and tell her that we became christians and brother brennan when he heard it you see that was spoken from their heart and it it started something so it's so important to speak from the heart to truth and god does something he does something in these meetings this is very important brother coleman in port elizabeth 1981 is brother twine i'm here is he is he still here he was here i don't see him but who was there in 81 in port elizabeth oh oh we have good remembrance we have good remembrance brother coleman was standing behind the platform and it was a real quiet auditorium he wasn't used this because it was a complaint there that people made too much noise and so brother roscoe said to his his church people stay in the back and no clapping no amens this time brother corman came in in the pulpit and stand before a real quiet congregation and then he he's he talks a quote from daniel where daniel was at the vision of the man standing on the water and you remember this and he compared it to revelation uh 10 um to revelation 10 the angel coming down having his one his first foot on the water and one on on on the land and he compared it and he said i'm standing now before real quiet congregation and he said but if you don't want it then stand on me and proclaim time no longer and he said when joe got such a revelation he fell on his face but you go out and say it was a nice sermon and send the holy ghost in the people in the back couldn't keep it any longer they couldn't keep it any longer they come screaming in front and we had an outpouring of the holy ghost for about one hour you were there brother owen and yeah you were there and uh brother peter chandler was on the platform yeah he was he was here and and down you went brother peter in the glory of god was poured all over over the place now he spoke brother coleman spoke from his heart he said what he felt and he remembered but it is not right said we react like this when the revelation comes like this and the holy ghost in the people also made them do something real from their heart nobody had to tell them come come in front coming from do this jump or whatever it work by itself it works by itself hallelujah and it specially works in your home we need the same anointing behind the pulpit we need in our living room then our children will be filled with the holy ghost in the living room hallelujah not only in church we have to become more sincere so this is just a little preparation for tonight then brother contact single brother chandler also for the wonderful message and brother robledo you you are here i enjoyed it very much thank you we know each other and we appreciate it so much the clear voice a clear clear voice you understand what he is saying and also the same very clear and in a special way so thank you it was so enjoyed so uh and also thank you brother vesco for for the testimony i still remember this glorious time in new york god did so so many so many many things it felt my lot to stand here in the gap that was given to our precious brother olu actually and can we stand for for two minutes and just pray for the church there and for brother acuchobi that couldn't be here lord jesus here i stand and they may see this video whatever father and caesar our special friends rosa olu and brother ago that they could they couldn't make it to be here but father in spirit we are there and we pray a special blessing over them father for for their health for their situations in their life for their families for their churches father o great angel of god jesus christ the holy ghost may you come down father and overshadow them and give them a special day in jesus name amen hallelujah you may be seated so as i said my title is lord prepare me and and i i want to mention again the spirit of properly kindness uh on the pastors that came to the platform at the end of your message brother brother ovid could that be a sign for a beginning healing of the seekers body is the body of jesus christ healing comes to this body by two things the prophet said by brotherly kindness and by the world the word is restored and brotherly love is our part and if you don't know where you find it you find it at calvary all these glorious things you find at calvary hallelujah says the prophecy of brother branham as brother thompson mentioned uh in one of his messages brother branham is crying out he gets into a vision he says i see something they will be one of these days don't fear little preacher they will be one why jesus christ prayed he said say maybe one and his prayer will be fulfilled no devil can change this hallelujah praise the lord and there is a prayer of jesus christ in john 17 that will be fulfilled amen so the glory that jesus had with the father this is john 17 5 20 to 26 i don't read it you you know his prayer the prayer of our lord jesus in saint john 17. so he said so the glory excuse me so the glory is that jesus had with a father before the world wars is very important now in in saint john 17 17 he says he speaks about this he said father glorify myself with the glory that i had before you before this world came into existence so you have your idea about what kind of glory this is we would like to find out because there is a lot of promise in in a message from brother branham the glory of god this is a unspoken message only written out prepared for december 25 1965. he couldn't preach it anymore but in his notes he is he i got a copy from brother coleman or actually he allowed us to make a photo picture he had it on his table in his living room and he allowed us and but i feel it's so important that we should share this for the ones that never heard it as their brother branham had written out his glory came down to moses on a range in median four thousand years ago his glory came down to shepherds on a range in bethlehem two thousand years ago his glory came down on a range in arizona three and a half years open to us the seven sealed mystery of his words said had he written out on one page in his notes hallelujah so his glory came down see glory said jesus said glorify me with that glories that i had before the foundation of the world with you his glory came down and did something now if he did did it one time two times three times in a special race's third time so he can do it also for you and for me to do the same thing because we know in not a lot of of quotes and of the message and of the word but to catch the life in the world for our soul that's what we want hallelujah now god's glory is his divine nature it's his nature his glory is his attributes did you ever see this pyramid what's written inside said this is god's glory you will appreciate that and this makes us one as brothers with different ideas coming from different churches brother branham said the first 20 years or how it was in the first time after pentecost everybody was satisfied with jesus christ and and the great atmosphere in the hearts of the people and it sent it something started but became bigger and darker and darker all through the ages something started he said it started little fellowships somebody had the revelations on brother and they grouped around him his sister was very innocent he said they were not satisfied with jesus christ so she started to fellowship there with his brother or visit with that brother you see but the glory of jesus christ makes us one one again and this is what i want in all for all my life i want this so we so we know as you see if he knows the trick of the devil we are careful because it something can start very innocent and then it goes it goes by and by in the more and more in the wrong direction so how by hearing [Music] hearing his voice word promises this is the way we become partakers of his divine nature we know this intellectually luther martin luther had an experience and i say this because to said to show something martin luther has an experience he gave lessons to monks concerning psalms and scriptures and letters in the new testament and so he should speak to them about the roman letter to romans that paul was writing and so he got so nervous and angry with god and he said we as sinners we are so condemned and live in this condition how can we be such and you want us to be a righteous righteous as you are and he was angry against god and then the grace of god dropped down on him in the same way as the grace of god dropped down on him he the same grace can drop down on you and will drop down on you if you believe the world and if you obey the words very simple send all these things coming to pass so it's a grace drop down on him and he realized that when he believes this says god gives him his own righteousness and god's righteousness will work in him his eyes became open and and and he surrendered himself he started to believe his righteousness and it worked it worked in him he he told his friends he said it was like parodies was opening for me it was and it is it is paradise is opening for you if you start to believe the promise if you start to that you receive the holy ghost the holy ghost is for you if you started it is given to you before the foundation of the world is given and you start to praise him by faith it will come down hallelujah whatever you ask it will happen unto you but you have to believe it this is the key hallelujah and jesus gives the peter to key this is a key to peter sorry jesus gave him the key to open the kingdom hallelujah and he wrote it down he said by these promises you become partaker of his divine nature of his glory hallelujah by these promises hearing and hearing comes christ the word hallelujah and you hear the word and you say oh god so easy so easy when you until you surrender to it and it comes upon you this is god's way doing it very simple if you try to understand it you can never understand it it has it is his realm you see it is it's not possible hallelujah it's not possible [Music] like like we have no no access otherwise to this sea of forgetfulness as the prophet said so natural man has not and no access but if jesus christ is in you you go in that atmosphere said it's no more there it's forgiven jesus lived in that atmosphere all the time he lived all the time in the atmosphere when he came this atmosphere was coming with him when brother branham came this atmosphere was coming with him and the people stepped in this atmosphere and when you are coming this atmosphere is going with you because you will experiment your face and will believe it and start believing in oh god i never knew this glory c 7 thunderc 7 virtues this is your glory this is your nature oh god i surrender and send this nature gets you hallelujah hallelujah don't have to think how shall i receive it and how shall i add and and all says this will not work this will not just surrender to the world take me lord take me in let it be come on me lord jesus so shall it be like mary said it shall happen unto me it's a promise of god and you see try it try it once then you try it once and you see it works you you got a lot of exploits and your family will be changed your face will be changed everything will be changed hallelujah around you hallelujah the bible will become new all these things just believing it's a promises embrace it and say yes lord luther he experimented it experimented he said and it works to his reference it's the same with god's wisdom you see you just surrender it it starts working in you yeah hallelujah oh it's glorious and then and then in your living room it goes automatically hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah and your ma and your wife will join like sister coleman join brother coleman hallelujah we need this we need life we have to become more sincere we have to we have to go to the cross you see brother brother is it i i have to just kept some skip something here it is there's a tremendous quote you may be seated uh i i hope i find it here in my in different letters but but maybe i mean coming coming to it so uh let me see no there was another one so so you become a partaker of course nature isn't that something for me this is this is gold hallelujah and if if we are told if we make investment with this all things are possible in our life all things because this glory comes on us and controls us controls our family controls my mouth controls everything this is wonderful you see people especially young people in this message they say they give often they give up and say i cannot live it sure we can also not live it yeah we are we are sinners saved by grace and may make mistakes we cannot live it but to have this inside that lifts it that lifts it and if you make a mistake quickly we say lord jesus i come again under your blood here i am please lord i talked about this brother forgive me lord forgive me lord i did this here i i was angry i didn't didn't behave in your glory lord forgive me and then you grow that without repentance no growing without repentance no starting hallelujah this is a key this is a key hallelujah so god's nature god's attributes are his glory being a savior salvation is a his glory comes down on your soul he saved me his presence all these attributes healer he is my healer and this healing attribute comes down takes all the evil out the problem is we don't experiment enough in our personal life we think we go to church and send somehow we will get it somebody prays for us and and okay and however we don't take it really sincere we should be so advanced so advanced there are there are promises laying before our before us that we have no idea in such a greatness but we have to start and experiment with it so [Music] and here second corinthians 3 i give you this scripture but we always open face beholding as in a glass mirror the glory of the lord in other words his glory is reflecting in us you go in your little chamber close the door and such a chamber in as jesus said in palestine doesn't have a window it is a it is a little chamber with no window for uh for food to put food there to store foods here so it's a good example you go there nothing from the outside you you just be with him your glory lord i experiment this is for me your glory father in heaven you made it all this is we have to do this i do this and it's tremendous it is so tremendous it changes me and i know some of my children are doing this and it changes us is something real it's not something in the head we are changed into the same image in his image we are changed just let it let it down the channel here we are changed if you say it for yourself by face lord jesus i am change see his presence comes down his glory comes down confirmation comes down that's the ceiling and this is still in this business hallelujah the lamb like nature i want to speak something about it we have strangled it brother brother branham spoke about this this glory we have killed when we were when we were raised as children first lie the first stealing is the first anger all this killed the lamb like nature it's not a literal lamb brother brahm said but in his in his uh maybe i have it here it's in your own heart see if you feel something tingling at your heart that's what it is it said attribute trying to declare itself if you feel i'm missing something in my life i believe the lord jesus i go to church but i i need something this is stinging from that attribute and heavenly father he says take us now lord let the great shepherd the great redeeming shepherd the great shepherd who left glory listen knowing that some of the attributes was lost on them great valleys of sin where the wolves and the animals would soon divorce them devours him said little sheep but he left the golden corridors come down into the earth and was made one of us so he could declare the love of god to us sir he found them some of them in their denominations he found me there also some of them in the house of ill fame some of them on the streets blind some of them in the hedges and highway but he redeemed everyone that's a father had ordained him to redeem hallelujah hallelujah so jesus he loved sinners that's what the pharisees hated on him said he had so much fellowship we see with these sinners they didn't even try to lift up their their hand when they were praying said and and and felt condemned and the pharisees in the back say look you see he doesn't even lift his hand so but he loved these kind of people and he still loves them he still loves us when we are falling he loves us so much and we are very stupid if we don't come to him when a child falls it goes to mama or papa if he is close he knows he runs and and if we do a mistake we try to hide instead of quickly immediately like brother branham he was used to do this he said i came in the plane and i was i got angry about a child said always cried and i got angry i thought cannot the mother stop this child coming from india or somewhere and then he confessed to his church and said he said if i go on like this i will lose a favor with god so little things if we do these little things in our families it will become heavenly it forgive me and say calvary makes all the difference there is where we get the spark to our knowledge to the mechanic at calvary i believe this i got my spark i did not know how to repent because i was raised as a child in a christian home and didn't know really i prayed and believed you know many know my story and i had a problem i thought how can i get the baptism of the holy ghost because i met some people that had this experience and i saw this is real i also met some that was imitating but i met some that was real and i wanted said and i had the problem but i i said i don't want to be a hypocrite and kneel down and say i'm such a bad guy i didn't feel that i'm a bad guy raised up in a christian home praying and believing the word and all this but never had a real experience with repentance and then i confessed it in a group of christian businessmen and and some some of them some of some of these people said uh oh this is not a problem i said no problem i would i would rather be a drunkard on the street and have a really experience with the lord and i don't have this he said she said no no it's another problem if you really want it you pray heavenly father give it to me and he will give it to you this is this is it's an old pentecost hallelujah and and we did this because we wanted said my wife and myself and we met calvary hallelujah we prayed and god opened up and if you need anything just pray don't wait pray and believe remember always don't just pray without thanking god that he is doing this what you pray we should not all our singing also in we are praying in our singing we shouldn't just not sing like this and and but no when we sing thank you lord you are doing this you are doing this i it will be fulfilled in my life it is a continuous fellowship with the lord our life hallelujah forgive me that's my way that's how i build brotherhood i admire you you can drive it down brother condo also when he comes to tonight i believe he will drive it down hallelujah but this is my way and it works also hallelujah god bless you richly hallelujah continues and he said but he left the golden corridors came down into the earth and was made one of us he was made one of us isn't that something left his glory to be one of us and he said even father glorify me again and the voice came i have done it and will do it and the people heard asunder hallelujah we know this so and but he left the golden corridors came down into the earth and was made one of us so he could declare the love of god to us there he found them some in damnation i read it already some in the ill-famed house on the streets and he redeemed them all is that something his attributes got lost in the valleys of sin but he redeemed them and yeah praise the lord we know so much scripture and how much do we practice it in our personal life there's another scripture that i really came over it jesus said no man puts a piece of a new garment upon the old if otherwise then both in new make it surrender it runs and and the peace that was taken out of the new agrees not with the old so it is a problem in our life if you just take one piece one revelation and lean on that and then don't come to the fullness in our time this fullness his glory is promised us and this glory will bring the adoption the perfection the fulfillment of everything in the rapture i believe in this glory it is jesus christ his glory and there's where the power lays i believe surely is in the world sure all his glory lays in the world but there's two things you see you can say oh we have taken from his fullness everything he has given us free everything is true but did we receive it did we take it in this is the question brother branham said jesus is coming i hope i have it you you have patience with me here thank you but here i want to read the real the quote he says confess you wrong burst pains this is a secret isn't it something that god helps us if if we come before him and confess it it's so important it's so important he says confess your wrong birth pains it's hard to die but die right now die come out of your own unbelief and the devil wants to keep us with little things that we don't confess in in our unbelief and we confess then we have an experience against as his glory comes down in our soul and we are growing by that we become man and woman in the in in this in this in this message in this life come out of this conditions this is the word of god made manifest just as it was when jesus came on earth it is jesus christ again among you proven it is good to come to to church and to praise him and worship but also it's good to go in in a corner sometimes and say lord jesus you are living in me make fellowship with sincereness it is a serious thing it's not just polished up just trained it's a serious thing in the heart the third pull has to do with our hearts we will speak from the heart and things will happen we will just three standings here and the love of god will drop down and take all the evil out brothers we cannot afford to not love and i mean real love one another if we have this glory in our hearts that makes us always one under the shed blood it makes us always one and if you hear this pray about it pray about it it could change it could it could come to a revival it can bring a revival and here there is one thing before i close i want to read this brother branham said in the message burst pains 65 he said and jesus is coming again this is our subject will he find faith does the son of man find faith this is our subject of this convention now i read this here and jesus is coming again brother branham said that's his spirit thank you lord now you can do an experience with jesus coming this is my way still some may not agree i may have a better idea i don't know but i take it for myself said is his spirit he is so close to the earth so close to coming that he is ready to receive you if you are ready to receive him if martin luther would live in our day i believe he would experiment with his experience concerning the righteousness of god and and all these great characteristics of god he had experience there he hadn't we the time wasn't so it wasn't the season it must always be also in the right season for him so but if he would be in our season i believe he would experiment with his experience concerning the righteousness of god said open paradise for him he would experiment with this quote he is so close to the earth so close to coming said he is ready to receive you if you are ready if you are ready to receive him at least you should say in our heart lord jesus comes home comes home says the spirit and the bride says speaks the same thing see a turning in their hearts together in in the spirit and the bride says the same things come lord jesus comes home and it is it is a way a personal way to receive him brothers and sisters of god has given us a key in this little afternoon meeting if we use this it will change our life secures just believe subvert take it in your heart receive it yes so it shall happen to me and then wait and adore him and praise him and the glory of god will come down and seal it in your heart and then as a new life god bless you for a mighty service tonight this was just a little preparation all these things you find at calvary anyhow let me here i have it the last quote is okay that's cool here we know this a message speak to the rock that where brother brother coleman preached in uh pretoria here uh brother branham says the gospel came to us not in word only but through power we all agree demonstration of the holy spirit we heard it this morning would come and demonstrate the gospel bringing the word to a living reality that's that's our theme rather which brings the word to a living reality and then he continues this is what we want a living reality and here he continues if your trust receives the word so it's a different ways of receiving we if if you he said if you receive him he is ready to receive you it's a different way of receiving we must we must catch this now he said if you just resist the word by knowing the word that doesn't you any good this is what we learn in sunday school and and go through the process and then we go in church and grow up like this and this this is not doing any good to you select achilles the spirit give his life then you must be born again and then the holy spirit quickens the word to you yeah i know i must be born again but how can it happen to me you must be worried and saying the holy spirit quickens the word to you in other words like a grain of corn if it's laying in my hand it is just a grain of corn it will never be nothing else and here it comes but bury it sets why we died with him at the cross buried with him and resurrect with him but it is a process and it kills you and it has it has pains in it tremendous pains but bury it it comes listen it comes contaminated brother robledo did you know this quote yeah he said bury this corn this seed bury it it comes contaminated you know we don't want to see it being contaminated jesus christ the seed of god got contaminated at the cross say spit on him say did everything with him with his body with his soul his spirit everything it got contaminated and same thing with us we cannot go around this but bury it it becomes contaminated molds dirt all around and then it brings up another grain of corn just like it you see we speaking about the seed and the real seed and we once said because in the real seed the real seed has a power the power working so normal is a seeds the word seed has it in it but it's not working in us if we just know it it doesn't help so we must dive with our lamb and it's painful you have to tell him sis i'm so wrong you have to have your personal experience all all the time i'm so wrong father but you forgive me you are so great you're so glorious your glory is so great and you get a baptism you you you get another baptism another baptism in another ceiling is another feeling and we have to go through this process very it it becomes contaminated with our stinking ego our stinking own self-life what we are what we what we are self righteous and all this we know we know how we know how we are so if we come out of of this system uh god will help us this is our place where we all die with our lamb and there you get this power experience that he is the same for me that he was yesterday's same glory and you get an assurance said what what comes out of your mouth is from him you get an assurance what's come out of your face to your family is from him we need this let us be more sincere and let us prepare our hearts in this way god bless you [Applause] amen appreciate the words [Applause] is that your desire to be a sanctuary for the glory of god to be living in you not just in church but at home where nobody's looking just to talk to the lord just to have that eternal fellowship like the prophet had for 33 years never left it i believe that's our desire and if as your desire let's just sing a song i'm thine oh lord i've heard thy voice i am thine oh lord i have heard thy voice and a told thy love to me but i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer your faith unlocks his glory in your life [Music] [Music] the cross where thou hast died [Music] lord to thy precious [Music] let's just give him a hand of praise and just thank him thank him for the cross for his forgiveness for his loving kindness thank you jesus we love you amen at this time [Music] i was mentioned that it's a special offering so if you like to give something contribute something special that'd be much appreciated as the deacons comes for a special offering let's just sing a song how great is our god how great [Music] is our god come sing with me how great is our god oh when all the sea i will see how great is our god the name above all names jesus christ oh he's the name [Applause] above all knees jesus how we love you you are worthy to be praised oh and our hearts will sing how great is our god here's a sanctuary singing it now oh how great is our god [Music] come sing with me how great [Music] is god what final time just the people oh how great [Music] is our god [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] let's just worship him [Music] [Music] continue worshiping the walls
