[18:05] st. Luke chapter 14 reading from verse
[18:11] 16 st. Luke 14 and reading from verse 16
[18:24] then said he unto him a certain man made
[18:28] a great supper and beat many and sent
[18:33] his servant at supper time to say to
[18:35] them that were bidden come for all
[18:39] things are now ready and they all with
[18:43] one consent began to make excuse the
[18:48] first said unto him I have bought a
[18:50] piece of ground and I must needs go and
[18:53] see it I pray thee have me excused and
[18:57] another said I have bought five yoke of
[19:00] oxen and I go to prove them
[19:02] I pray thee have me excused and another
[19:07] said I have married a wife and therefore
[19:10] I cannot come so that servant came and
[19:16] showed his Lord these things and then
[19:18] the master of the house being angry said
[19:21] to his servant go out quickly into the
[19:24] streets and lanes of the city and bring
[19:29] in hither the poor and a memed and the
[19:32] halt and the blind and the servant said
[19:35] Lord it is done as
[19:36] has commanded and yet there is room and
[19:41] the Lord said unto the servant go out
[19:43] into the highways and hedges and compel
[19:46] them to come in that my house may be
[19:49] filled for I say unto you that none of
[19:52] those men which were bidden shall taste

[23:43] the greatest performance manager that we
[23:45] have ever seen whatever he said that
[23:48] he's gonna do he is obligated to do it
[23:51] oh somebody say man and God is looking
[23:54] for somebody this morning who will do
[23:57] what he has written for them to do
[23:59] he is looking outside the book he knows
[24:02] the beginning he knows the middle
[24:04] he knows the ending and nothing will
[24:07] stop the purpose of God than sinning you
[24:09] this morning so I don't know about you

[24:29] more room for doubt so much higher
[24:32] there's no room for tiredness so much
[24:35] higher there's no room for a crisis it's
[24:38] so much higher there's the room for back
[24:40] pain I up there's no room for heart ache
[24:43] up high there's no room to be
[24:46] backslidden in this service the
[24:48] backsliders will be restored I'm not
[24:51] talking maybe I'm not talking perhaps
[24:54] but in this service the house of hell
[24:57] has got to give way to the name of Jesus
[25:00] yes
[25:01] power in the name there's healing in the
[25:04] name of chance deliverance in the name
[25:06] oh you don't hear me this morning maybe
[25:09] you're in the wrong place or maybe in
[25:11] the right place but but the Branham
[25:13] taught us up you cannot ever come to
[25:16] church and remain the same he said you
[25:18] either get better or you can't worse but
[25:21] I believe in my heart is small and there
[25:24] are some people in the house
[25:25] who want to get better there one to
[25:28] change they want on or they want a new
[25:31] top they want an experience they want to
[25:35] meet the pillar of fire they want to
[25:37] hear from God for themselves somebody
[25:41] give God worship hallelujah
[25:44] you may be seated I'm gonna warn you
[25:47] this morning hallelujah God adores
[25:50] worship he requires worship the very
[25:54] definition of God is object of worship
[25:58] some of you playing games in here this
[25:59] morning because under different
[26:01] circumstances and at different times of
[26:04] you respond differently but when you
[26:07] come to the house of God we come to give
[26:09] him our all give him our everything
[26:12] becomes a push as we have never pushed
[26:15] before your identity could be our day
[26:19] and God loves it 20 years you reached
[26:22] out to him he loves it when you cry and
[26:25] sad he loves the touch when you screams
[26:29] as your Lord
[26:30] I've been messed up a long time but not
[26:33] today
[26:33] today is my day I'm not going home
[26:37] unless I get a touch from the Lord if
[26:39] that is your prayer then God to do
[26:42] something for you if that is your desire
[26:45] then God to do something for you you may
[26:48] be seated
[26:50] with a brand I'm in the message mighty
[26:52] God unveiled he said I am identified
[26:55] look at the prophets identification away
[26:58] with the dead churches and the message
[27:00] they have nowhere to go but the Branham
[27:02] said I'm identified with a group that
[27:04] feels the Spirit of God if you ain't
[27:08] feeling the spirits of God but the
[27:10] random has nothing with you
[27:11] he said I'm identified with a group that
[27:13] feels the Spirit of God
[27:15] I'm identified with a group that knows
[27:18] is unveiled up to know these unveil
[27:21] means that every mystery is revealed the
[27:24] mystery of who you are
[27:26] the mystery of who God is the mystery of
[27:28] where you come from the mystery of where
[27:31] you're going the mystery of why there's
[27:33] power inside of you right now that your
[27:36] sin cannot stop your situation cannot
[27:39] stop because that seed that's inside of
[27:42] you comes from God and it's going back
[27:45] to God can I get a witness and the house
[27:48] this morning
[27:49] though you may be seated he said he's
[27:52] the same yesterday today and forever and
[27:54] knows that this is not fanaticism these
[27:58] are not my words but returns I'm reading
[28:00] the Prophet with it's Jesus Christ the
[28:03] same yesterday today and forever
[28:05] I'm identified with that group they may
[28:08] be called a bunch of heretics fanatics
[28:11] on my account but I'm not ashamed of the
[28:14] gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed
[28:16] of shouting I'm not ashamed to worship
[28:19] I'm not ashamed to testify I'm not I'll
[28:22] see this if thank you Jesus
[28:24] I'm not ashamed of the trials I'm not
[28:26] ashamed of the testing I'm a regime of
[28:28] the reproach I'm not a shame this
[28:30] morning because this gospel is the power
[28:33] of God unto salvation
[28:37] [Applause]
[28:49] hallelujah hallelujah oh yes it's all
[28:53] right to worship it's all yes all the
[28:56] way down in the back it's all right to
[28:58] worship I love the high in the front
[29:00] it's all right to worship I'm looking
[29:02] for this place to be consumed entire
[29:04] that you can't go home the same way you
[29:07] could testify he touched me he touched
[29:09] me oh he touched me this is upper room
[29:12] kind of environment maybe you weren't
[29:15] there the upper room I wasn't there but
[29:17] this is what it was like because Peter
[29:19] couldn't help himself
[29:20] oh my mama that's what we need Jim
[29:26] Killeen's
[29:27] I blew Holy Ghost revival but the
[29:31] Branham didn't come first to have books
[29:33] and tapes he came to see a church in
[29:36] killing high blue holy ghost fire within
[29:41] the church this cannot stand
[29:45] being dead cannot stay in the church its
[29:48] resurrection power it's the power to

[32:56] deal it's gonna move from mental feet
[32:58] the spiritual feet you have heard the
[33:01] message by the hearing of the air but

[33:07] the dynamics to the mechanics
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:13] you may be seated
[33:18] [Applause]
[33:21] I'm an expectation to see a church that
[33:25] brother branham spoke about sure she
[33:28] said God will have a spotless church
[33:30] gonna have a super church those were the
[33:33] words that Malachi 4 used and I'm gonna
[33:35] use those same words a super Church he
[33:38] wants to see a super Church he's not
[33:40] defining it by this group and that group
[33:42] he's talking about the bride party an
[33:45] invincible army an unstoppable army what
[33:48] sin do you have this morning that could
[33:50] come in front of a super church what
[33:53] sickness do you have this morning
[33:54] nothing will stand up before a super
[33:57] church this than a Pentecostal church
[33:59] not a Methodist Church and a Baptist
[34:02] Church this is the house of God somebody
[34:06] say man he may be seated
[34:09] [Applause]
[34:16] so I have a title this morning my title
[34:22] is no more excuses cuts in and again no
[34:33] more excuses say it with me no more
[34:37] excuses one more time no more excuses
[34:41] one more time no more excuses I can't
[34:44] hear you no more excuses give the Lord a
[34:48] hand oh praise my subject recognizing
[34:55] who you are what you are called to do
[34:57] and that now is the time and my
[35:00] inspiration a manifestation of a super
[35:03] Church because that's our promise a
[35:06] manifestation of a super church now when
[35:09] you study the scripture and you read by
[35:11] the branham's message he said on the day
[35:13] of Pentecost they had a super church it
[35:16] was a powerful Church it was a Holy
[35:18] Ghost led church there was no sin in the
[35:20] church when Ananias came up to Peter he
[35:23] didn't realize at the pillar of fire had
[35:26] tabernacle itself on Peters hat and
[35:28] Peter was no longer in the driver's seat
[35:31] but the Holy Ghost was in the driver's
[35:32] seat so when he thought he was lying to
[35:35] pizza he was lied to the Holy Ghost and
[35:37] God killed him on the spot
[35:39] [Applause]
[35:41] in that super church Peter would walk
[35:44] and the light of the Sun would shine on
[35:47] Peter and Peter shadow people were being
[35:50] healing his shadow
[35:51] that's the attributes of a super church
[35:57] somebody helped me this morning Paul is
[36:00] preaching somebody falls dead
[36:02] he doesn't just call an emergency he
[36:04] prays challenge around keeps on
[36:06] preaching and that put us on fire you
[36:09] can't tell me that brother died in
[36:11] church God resurrected in church and sat
[36:13] there for the rest of the service good
[36:15] word City let me take notes about what I
[36:20] experienced no after he fell dead and he
[36:24] came back to life they couldn't stop him
[36:26] jumping I don't know if he heard another
[36:28] word that Paul said but he knew he was
[36:32] there he died and something came over me

[38:50] job is my job
[38:51] just come he sent out invitations come
[38:55] don't worry about what you're wearing
[38:56] come because in those days when you
[38:59] invited the provider robe for you so

[39:03] worry about the food there's no
[39:05] admission fee there's no cost to you

[39:17] and when you're having a big feast or a
[39:20] big convention or a big festival or
[39:22] whatever it is there's a lot of
[39:24] preparation that goes into it there's a
[39:28] lot of rifice there's lots of time
[39:30] it's what the planning and this great
[39:32] man this certain man he took a lot of
[39:35] time because he wanted his guests to
[39:37] have the very best treatment he didn't
[39:40] want to just have chicken you were the
[39:41] chicken and fish and steak and pork and
[39:44] shrimp and caviar
[39:46] he wanted to make sure it was a
[39:48] delectable cuisine of the finest
[39:50] selection because he was catering for
[39:53] the best of the best
[39:54] he was catering for royalty he was
[39:58] catering for individuals who had been
[40:01] selected who had been chosen
[40:05] you may be seated you may be seated
[40:08] so he came out an announcement he got
[40:11] his right-hand man he said all things

[40:18] is ready for the vegetarians is rice and
[40:21] tofu whatever you need is already no

[40:40] [Applause]
[40:43] you may be seated and one by one they
[40:49] start to make excuses and there's
[40:54] something about this thing called
[40:56] excuses because it excuses when you pass
[40:59] on the responsibility for your action on
[41:02] to someone else or something else and
[41:08] they are good excuses there are bad
[41:12] excuses these excuses were not horrible

[42:06] the end of the day God being a court of

[42:13] interested in only one thing
[42:14] results he's not interested in your
[42:18] reason he's an interested in your excuse

[42:31] so a woman calls out to the silver who
[42:33] comes back depressed and explains it to
[42:35] the masses listen go to the highways of

[42:46] tips that's too much anointed there's
[42:48] too much violence too much inspiration
[42:50] this there's too much hidden under the
[42:53] Seventh Seal that I prepare for all this
[42:55] time for there to be nobody to enjoy
[42:58] this food
[43:01] he said go out to the highways go to the
[43:04] Pirates go and fight people who look
[43:06] like they're not gonna make it but
[43:08] they're gonna make it go and fight some

[43:40] surfing came back is less than I went
[43:42] into that and yet his room I invited
[43:46] everybody in our circle but your dad's
[43:48] room
[43:49] he said quarterly hot go to the lame go
[43:51] to them who have read problems go to the
[43:53] hard cases those who people already give
[43:56] up on them and tell them they can never
[43:57] go to heaven go to them to my table will
[44:02] be full there will be a price revival
[44:05] there will be a manifestation of this
[44:07] message of Malachi 4 quad will raise up
[44:11] people who all the other against them
[44:13] but they couldn't make it
[44:15] they are gonna make it they are gonna
[44:18] overcome can the church say man I'm
[44:23] mother Branham said you may be seated
[44:25] I gotta find its way but but brother
[44:28] Brennan said it was excuses that they
[44:31] meet in the days of Luther because the
[44:34] standard was set but these are Luther
[44:36] they made excuses that's why they
[44:38] couldn't meet the simple and that's why
[44:40] the whole goes had to move on because
[44:41] they made excuses but the random even
[44:43] said excuses is denomination he said
[44:46] your Creed could become an excuse but
[44:48] I'm a deacon in this church that's why I
[44:50] can't go to that group and he said all
[44:52] of that is excuses
[44:55] [Applause]
[45:01] my weatherman said they made excuses in
[45:04] the days of Moses they made excuses in
[45:06] the days of Elijah
[45:08] they made excuses in the days of Christ
[45:09] and they make excuses today but the
[45:20] Branum said in the message is your life
[45:23] worthy of the gospel he said if Israel
[45:25] 2000 years ago would have accepted the
[45:28] invitation they were given there
[45:30] wouldn't be as they are today 2,000
[45:33] years ago Israel turned down the
[45:35] invitation to come to the wedding supper
[45:37] and they've turned it down and went into
[45:39] judgment wondering about Jesus when did
[45:44] this man get his learning what school is
[45:46] he from is this not the carpenter's son
[45:51] can the church say Amen but the branding
[45:53] whether he said Jesus was trying to tell
[45:56] them that they excuses was what killed
[45:58] the prophets
[45:59] that's a prophets word and what killed
[46:03] her right just to come
[46:04] he said they accepted their Creed's that
[46:06] men had given them instead of taking a
[46:08] word of God and by doing so have made a
[46:11] Word of God of none effect how much a a
[46:16] man
[46:17] so as a people we have become very good
[46:20] at making excuses I've made too many
[46:27] mistakes I've never done this before I
[46:30] don't have the right tools I don't know
[46:34] how to use the tools that brother
[46:38] stumbled me she started it he made me do
[46:45] it the neighbor did it I was good on
[46:49] Sunday you know all David's service was
[46:52] powerful but by Monday it was Nicole and
[47:01] I wasn't gonna respond but then she tell
[47:03] me that ting that was it excuses I
[47:11] didn't have time I don't have time I
[47:17] have work commitments I don't speak with
[47:22] that brother I'm not qualified I don't
[47:27] have an education I don't have any
[47:30] experience my family doesn't support me
[47:34] I don't have any friends what are these
[47:36] all excuses because what I want to see
[47:40] this morning at the end of the day when
[47:42] all your excuses finish you're still
[47:45] gonna get the Holy Ghost you're still
[47:47] gonna be delivered you're still gonna
[47:49] get your breakthrough you're still gonna
[47:51] have a reviler
[47:53] [Applause]
[47:55] you maybe see them
[47:58] we have excuses for why we why we have
[48:02] three why we didn't read the scriptures
[48:06] we have excuses for why we didn't pay
[48:09] our tithes we have excuses for why we
[48:11] lit so I wouldn't shake this brother's
[48:16] hand we have legitimate excuses in our
[48:19] minds of why we cannot forgive but we're
[48:23] in church every Sunday but there's a
[48:24] reason why I just cannot let it go
[48:31] excuses but the water this morning is no
[48:36] more excuses can the church say man
[48:49] cannot oh but Moses a little bit God had
[48:55] reached a point his limit
[48:56] with what was happening with the
[48:58] children of Israel so he said I've I've
[49:01] heard the cries of my people and I've
[49:04] come down and God had to find the right
[49:08] man
[49:09] the right person the right individual
[49:12] maybe didn't feel good about themselves
[49:14] but that didn't matter because God has
[49:16] his own plan and God had to interrupt
[49:18] his interrupt this man's life called
[49:23] Moses just the same record has to
[49:25] interrupt us so many times but put
[49:27] different situation in front of us to
[49:29] catch our attention because we get so
[49:31] used to the hustle and the bustle and we
[49:33] have to recognize the devil's job and I
[49:36] said this on Tuesday night remember the
[49:37] chapel's job is to use your job to use
[49:40] your neighbor to use the weather to use
[49:43] your paycheck to use your bank account
[49:45] do you think I'm not working to do
[49:47] everything in his power to give you an
[49:49] excuse to not see who you really are and
[49:52] not realize the potential that God has
[49:54] for you
[49:55] [Applause]
[49:57] so God has to interrupt Moses his life
[50:00] and chops down and consumes drops honor
[50:03] and a tree and fire comes down and an
[50:06] attraction in the mountain and Moses
[50:08] sees it you say this is something
[50:10] because it's on fire but it's not
[50:12] burning and Moses comes up there and God
[50:14] begins to speak to Moses I've heard the
[50:16] cries of my people there are some people
[50:18] who need deliverance Moses I've been
[50:21] living so long in the message 40 years
[50:23] in the message that he had lost the
[50:26] burden and God is saying to Moses after
[50:29] the cries of my people you have family
[50:31] down there that need a liver you have
[50:34] sons and daughters and neighbors and
[50:36] relatives people you grew up with who
[50:38] need deliverance I gotta send somebody
[50:39] but you gotta go you have got to go you
[50:44] have got to do it you have got to
[50:46] forgive you have got to love you have
[50:49] got to drop yours you have got to pray
[50:51] I've come down but you got to go let me
[50:54] see it again
[50:55] I've come down but you got to go I came
[50:58] down with a message through a prophet
[50:59] but you got to go I'm not going you got
[51:02] to go I've already come down seven

[51:08] but you got to go there's something that
[51:10] you got to do I've come down but you got
[51:14] to go
[51:16] you may be seated I went quite explained

[51:28] to use PowerPoint I don't know how to do
[51:30] presentations I never sell to anybody
[51:33] I never present to anybody I never tried
[51:36] I don't know how I'll tell them that
[51:37] they could be free I'm I've been feeling
[51:39] free how I could tell and I can't
[51:44] imagine cordis watch Moses talking I say

[55:32] maybe see that that attitude changes
[55:37] everything about you because the next
[55:42] excuses are way out but I realized
[55:44] something you see when you get desperate
[55:47] when you get that sway there's no room
[55:49] vex uses enough doors for men who had a
[55:52] friend who with the quitter condition of
[55:55] palsy he was shaking and trembling he
[55:58] create was an involuntary country he
[56:01] lost control and he heard that Jesus was
[56:03] in the town having a whole house eaten
[56:07] when they heard that brother Mikey they
[56:10] say we gotta get our friend to Jesus
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:13] didn't make his condition an excuse they
[56:16] found a way to put him on the bed they
[56:19] were walking on the road like this
[56:20] because he was shaken that wasn't the
[56:22] excuse your car could have three tires
[56:24] that's no excuse
[56:28] doesn't matter what the situation is
[56:31] there is no excuse for you getting what
[56:34] you came to get this morning you may be
[56:37] seated
[56:38] and brother Gerald when they got to the
[56:41] hosts meeting God loves to create
[56:43] situations to test if you're gonna make
[56:46] an excuse if you can have a reason for
[56:48] why and I praying
[56:49] why not sighing why in a desperate I
[56:52] mean they cut the other houses full
[56:54] convention overflowing
[56:56] there's no room those guys had a
[56:57] legitimate excuse we cannot get to Jesus
[57:01] but those brothers because of
[57:03] desperation they took the approach no
[57:05] excuses
[57:06] we got to get this man to Jesus they
[57:09] analyzed the situation I don't know you
[57:11] maybe see that if there was an engineer
[57:13] in the group you may be seen analyze the
[57:17] building he said well if we go up to the
[57:19] side and go to the top and we dig a hole
[57:22] with this circumference I don't know how
[57:24] they did it
[57:25] however they did it they found a way
[57:27] they didn't make an excuse they were
[57:30] probably shaking on the way of the house
[57:31] that didn't matter to them they were
[57:34] determined to get to Jesus you maybe see
[57:39] them when you take the approach as a
[57:41] Christian no excuses nothing will stop
[57:44] you
[57:46] you may be seated and that's why I
[57:48] realize a lot of people don't have fit
[57:52] I've said to the young people
[57:54] I said listen if the job that you are in
[57:57] is taking you away from God you are in
[57:59] the wrong job don't tell me you need
[58:03] this job to pay the bills if it's taking
[58:05] you away from God because if you make
[58:07] the decision to follow God he's gonna
[58:09] give you the right job
[58:10] [Applause]
[58:17] no more excuses
[58:19] you maybe see it so don't tell me
[58:21] because of your job is why it's good
[58:23] have to be on the edge right millimeters
[58:27] is this shift a little bit no more
[58:31] excuses I have to quote there may get it
[58:38] or not but the banner said that's why he
[58:40] preaches as hard as he can because of
[58:42] the Day of Judgment Corps don't want to
[58:44] hear your excuse
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:50] this is not man standard God accepts no
[58:55] excuses it's the life or nothing so you
[59:01] have to understand and that's why sent
[59:03] some to a couple months ago prove God
[59:06] [Music]
[59:07] prove God that's what the will need to
[59:11] see the unfeeling reality for the random
[59:13] breach of the Living God is either he's
[59:15] your vagina or he's not Jehovah Jireh
[59:18] but if he is your provider he is
[59:20] obligated to provide for you put them to
[59:24] the test no excuses no more excuses give
[59:31] me liberty or give me death I want to be
[59:35] a real Christian or no Christian at all
[59:37] no more excuses
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:48] God will force the issue in your life to
[59:51] bring his plan into accomplishment look
[59:56] at Gideon Gideon oh mighty man of Valor
[1:00:00] excuse number one i'm from the smallest
[1:00:03] tribe is that this is a triumvirate of
[1:00:09] excuses and from the smallest tribe and
[1:00:12] if you analyze you whole tribe
[1:00:14] my family is you smallest family in this
[1:00:17] small astray but not I want to go deeper
[1:00:21] than that smallest tribe smallest family
[1:00:24] and I'm the smallest one in my family so
[1:00:32] when you top of this
[1:00:33] Gideon Mike you might not follow this is
[1:00:36] somebody else gotta be talking about me
[1:00:39] and go they say you are the one going
[1:00:42] when your excuses finally run out and
[1:00:45] they have no more excuses you still go
[1:00:49] can the church say man
[1:00:52] I hope this sings down inside of your
[1:00:55] heart I'm tired of people telling me
[1:00:59] they don't have time to pray and and you
[1:01:04] have an excuse for that you don't have
[1:01:08] time to read the Bible it is is there an
[1:01:12] excuse for that you come to church when
[1:01:15] you want to is there an excuse for that
[1:01:18] where are you going when you don't put
[1:01:21] God what message do you believe when you
[1:01:26] have a excuse adjust if you get a reason
[1:01:29] for why I can't forgive husbands in the
[1:01:33] house there's no excuse husband love
[1:01:36] your eyes
[1:01:39] wives reverence your husband there's no
[1:01:42] excuse there's no there's no a B C or D
[1:01:45] pick one how much no more excuses give
[1:01:55] me liberty or give me dead
[1:01:58] it's good to shout and jump but there
[1:02:01] people in the house with what kind of
[1:02:03] stuff on the inside that only you know
[1:02:06] and guard know is there and that's what
[1:02:08] you wouldn't deal with this morning it's
[1:02:12] easy to talk about now it's your brother
[1:02:14] a sister somebody did you but there's
[1:02:16] some stuff that some of us carry on the
[1:02:18] inside and we don't want nobody to talk
[1:02:21] about we don't want nobody to address we
[1:02:23] want to mine it and grow it up until it
[1:02:26] becomes so big it takes you over
[1:02:28] completely many times we talk about the
[1:02:32] enemy on the outside and it's dissonance
[1:02:35] that's and it's dishonest that and it's
[1:02:36] dissing instead but what do you do when
[1:02:38] the enemy is on the inside it's easy on
[1:02:46] the outside do the whole show you know
[1:02:49] God bless you God with a Raymond
[1:02:51] Thompson I believe it was so beautifully
[1:02:53] at the convention center brandon rooze
[1:02:55] our love to go to the hills to the
[1:02:57] mountains because he got tired of
[1:02:59] shaking brothers hands who saying god
[1:03:02] bless you and he's seeing that there was
[1:03:03] no love him in their hearts so i'm going
[1:03:12] beyond visual this morning i'm going
[1:03:15] beyond the external this morning and i
[1:03:17] say there's no excuse for that MV
[1:03:22] there's no excuses for the jealousy in
[1:03:25] your heart there's no excuse for the
[1:03:28] animosity there's no excuse young
[1:03:31] brother young sister for how you
[1:03:32] disrespect your parents even if you
[1:03:35] don't see it but it's on the inside you
[1:03:37] wanna dig that up this morning you are
[1:03:42] who you are when you are alone by
[1:03:45] yourself that's a review all of mankind
[1:03:52] has the ability to act Trinidadians are
[1:03:55] uniquely gifted in that area we are very
[1:04:00] good actors put on a great show Sunday
[1:04:04] Thursday Tuesday Youth Service me them
[1:04:07] on the street able to switch quickly
[1:04:08] from work for macula to God bless you
[1:04:11] you read that book no more excuses the
[1:04:27] Bible said in this commune read that
[1:04:30] great man got angry at the excuses and
[1:04:35] understand this as I said earlier they
[1:04:38] were relatively legitimate you can tell
[1:04:41] a man to buy his land and dual- property
[1:04:45] and take care of his wife those are
[1:04:47] responsibilities but God is digging
[1:04:50] deeper to see you after prayers arise
[1:04:52] this specific invitation to the wedding
[1:04:56] supper this invitation to the Holy Ghost
[1:04:58] this invitation to the rapture
[1:05:04] let's the cares of this life shock you
[1:05:07] and while you may have good motives and
[1:05:10] good objectives and try to do the right
[1:05:12] thing and do be nice to people and read
[1:05:16] and pray and all the nice mannerisms you
[1:05:18] still miss the fundamental aspect of its
[1:05:21] the thunder the life that shakes the
[1:05:24] devil and if the talk of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] itself is what God is looking for when
[1:05:33] the purpose is put a mark upon those
[1:05:35] that sigh and cry for the abomination in
[1:05:38] the city we have become so insensitive
[1:05:42] to the abomination in the city now we
[1:05:46] accept it when the abomination should
[1:05:49] make us feel a certain way enough to
[1:05:52] make you sigh and cry when said you say
[1:05:55] no God have mercy you just see things
[1:05:57] and let's let it go without catching a
[1:05:59] burden for it what is your excuse this
[1:06:04] morning for not saying for not crying
[1:06:07] what is your Excuse this morning for not
[1:06:10] building a prayer altar in your house
[1:06:14] your wife cannot be your Excuse your
[1:06:18] husband cannot be your issues having no
[1:06:21] money cannot be your excuse not being
[1:06:24] able to pay the rent is not an excuse
[1:06:26] not having a house is not an excuse not
[1:06:29] having a husband or wife or a boyfriend
[1:06:31] or that's not an excuse
[1:06:44] you see when you really look now at the
[1:06:47] excuses from a deeper level you see it's
[1:06:48] it's real a decision is being made you
[1:06:51] know those that were invited made a
[1:06:56] choice not to go so the excuse is really
[1:07:02] an explanation of why you didn't do it
[1:07:06] so the question is warning is what is
[1:07:09] more important than this put another way
[1:07:17] what does it profit a man to gain the
[1:07:19] whole world and lose his soul
[1:07:27] so God so loved the world he sacrificed
[1:07:30] everything he gave His only begotten Son
[1:07:33] that we could have this access this
[1:07:35] morning there is nothing to gain without
[1:07:39] sacrifice
[1:07:43] there is no reward without sacrifice
[1:07:47] you won't success in your school you
[1:07:50] have to sacrifice how do you measure
[1:07:53] that sacrifice you study you go to your
[1:07:56] class
[1:07:56] you read you review that's the process
[1:08:00] that's the sacrifice sometimes you want
[1:08:03] to go and play sometimes you want to go
[1:08:05] out but you make a sacrifice because you
[1:08:07] have an exam coming up and because you
[1:08:09] want results and you won the reward you
[1:08:11] have to make a choice to sacrifice
[1:08:14] certain things because you want the
[1:08:18] reward you want to buy a house you want
[1:08:23] to buy a car you want to buy something
[1:08:24] of value you can't spend the same way
[1:08:28] you did really didn't want those things
[1:08:29] all of a sudden you decide to have a
[1:08:31] budget because your CV there's something
[1:08:34] there will be peace when you want to eat
[1:08:36] a KFC you want a trapeze which is set up
[1:08:40] in our snack pack to peace because
[1:08:44] there's a sacrifice it's also good for
[1:08:47] your health too because you want a
[1:08:52] reward but there's a misconception with
[1:08:58] the kingdom of God that people want to
[1:09:01] come to church and then they looked at a
[1:09:03] pastor pray for me
[1:09:08] they come to church and they expect
[1:09:11] things to happen that because they came
[1:09:13] to church they are now on this register
[1:09:16] that no opens up the daughter unlimited
[1:09:19] blessings unlimited favor without
[1:09:22] sacrifice and that does not exist
[1:09:29] you have to sacrifice the Bible says we
[1:09:34] bring a sacrifice of praise praise
[1:09:37] itself is a sacrifice some of you in
[1:09:39] here and we even want to praise and
[1:09:41] that's that's that's that's a sacrifice
[1:09:43] that you cannot yet that you must be
[1:09:45] able to do because a sacrifice of praise
[1:09:47] is when you don't feel like prison he is
[1:09:51] still worthy of the praise
[1:09:52] so you sacrifice your feeling you
[1:09:55] sacrifice what's happening in your life
[1:09:57] and it's a sacrifice of praise because
[1:10:00] you are knowledge and that he deserves
[1:10:02] the praise whether you have money or no
[1:10:04] money whether you're sick or not sick
[1:10:07] whether you're having a good day or
[1:10:09] party you need a choice of sacrifice and
[1:10:13] to give God praise and worship because
[1:10:15] He is God and there's none like him
[1:10:18] there's none higher than him there's
[1:10:20] none greater than him there's no God
[1:10:23] like Jehovah and it's a sacrifice of
[1:10:25] praise because when the praises go up
[1:10:27] the glory of God must come down
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:38] you maybe see them so having a random 12
[1:10:44] of those all-night peer meetings and
[1:10:47] that's why we're balanced said you could
[1:10:48] sing too much you could preach too much
[1:10:51] you could dance too much but you could
[1:10:53] never pray never pray too much I need to
[1:11:00] bring back the church to that level of
[1:11:03] sign and crying a church that is not
[1:11:05] sighing and crying is dying because
[1:11:11] they're shouting and jumping on the
[1:11:12] outside doesn't deal with the issues on
[1:11:14] the inside there's a surgery that needs
[1:11:19] to take place you can't go to a hospital
[1:11:23] surgery and do what you want before the
[1:11:24] doctor sell it before you come in for
[1:11:26] the surgery don't eat for 24 hours they
[1:11:29] certain things you have to do in
[1:11:31] preparation for the surgery that's just
[1:11:34] the way it is just what all the people
[1:11:38] sanctify yourself because in a few days
[1:11:42] we are going over you can do what you
[1:11:43] want no more excuses I pray that the
[1:11:52] light this morning would shine upon the
[1:11:54] Seas in your soul and you could
[1:11:59] recognize what turn away living it the
[1:12:03] woman with the issue of blood she had
[1:12:06] been in that condition for some time she
[1:12:10] spent her money she got results the
[1:12:14] doctor saw what was going on she spent
[1:12:18] more money and the condition wasn't
[1:12:21] getting better she could have blamed the
[1:12:26] doctor she could have blamed the
[1:12:27] medication she could have blamed stress
[1:12:29] she could have done whatever she wanted
[1:12:30] but when she heard Jesus was in town
[1:12:34] she had no excuse nobody was gonna stop
[1:12:38] up because she didn't want that
[1:12:40] opportunity to pass her by so she began
[1:12:45] a press so e to Jesus and her on Jesus
[1:12:50] was there are so many people she didn't
[1:12:52] make that an excuse she didn't make a
[1:12:57] crowd and excuse she didn't make what
[1:13:00] other people doing an excuse and that's
[1:13:02] why when God speaks to your heart you
[1:13:04] have to respond to God
[1:13:06] you know responding to me you spoil it
[1:13:08] to his word
[1:13:09] just something shrimps inside of your
[1:13:11] heart and you want to jump that's on you
[1:13:13] it doesn't matter if anybody else
[1:13:14] jumping anybody else shouted it's you
[1:13:17] and God give us more individuals who
[1:13:25] will be so focused and the promise of
[1:13:26] God that it would have no excuses thank
[1:13:39] you Jesus
[1:13:42] but the Branham said hear their excuses
[1:13:46] as their Creed's and denominations you
[1:13:51] see your belief could be an excuse I
[1:13:54] mean but about as long as the
[1:13:57] denomination your excuses try to shadow
[1:13:59] that seed that you know actually lays
[1:14:03] there you are taking the part of lot he
[1:14:06] said throw them things away and let the
[1:14:08] gospel light shining upon their the
[1:14:10] power of Jesus Christ
[1:14:12] keeping the light off of it will keep it
[1:14:15] from living because if the light ever
[1:14:17] gets to it it'll spring forth to life
[1:14:20] but it matters it that's the reason that
[1:14:23] people see it don't go to some of them
[1:14:24] kind of meeting they're afraid some of
[1:14:27] the light will strike one of their
[1:14:28] members but the man said remember the
[1:14:33] woman at the well she was a prostitute
[1:14:35] she stood there they stood the priest
[1:14:38] they have seen Jesus turn Nataniel I saw
[1:14:40] you when you were under the fig tree in
[1:14:42] order and this is a woman when she
[1:14:44] walked up there in
[1:14:45] immoral state at the well living with
[1:14:47] six men and when she walked up in that
[1:14:49] state jesus said bring me a drink the
[1:14:52] conversation started go get your husband
[1:14:55] and come here she said I don't have any
[1:14:58] you said the truth - you've got five on
[1:15:00] the one you live with not your husband
[1:15:02] she said I perceive that your prophet
[1:15:04] and that goes on belly-band said that
[1:15:08] settled when the light flashed across
[1:15:10] the seed laying in that little old
[1:15:12] harlot the holidays was over into the
[1:15:15] streets she went more if I am God she
[1:15:19] didn't make her pass an excuse
[1:15:21] she don't worry what anybody else said
[1:15:23] about her she said come see a man who
[1:15:25] told me the things I've done
[1:15:27] isn't this the Messiah what was it the
[1:15:31] light got to that seed back under the
[1:15:34] shadow of that prostitute shelter so
[1:15:37] Cortana wait for the light to get to
[1:15:41] that see God Himself you let me see it
[1:15:45] you have to understand God Himself lives
[1:15:47] by that no it's useless you know so it's
[1:15:53] not something just for you I'm gone
[1:15:55] don't live by those rules when it was
[1:15:58] time for court to do deliverance the
[1:16:00] Bible said he was so tired he said take
[1:16:03] me to the other side and he went to
[1:16:05] sleep on the boat and it was on the way
[1:16:08] to the other side that the devil come
[1:16:10] and bring him the storm they they they
[1:16:12] can I say let's go back to the shore on
[1:16:14] the other and go back to where we came
[1:16:15] from but God had a destination because I
[1:16:18] was a man on the other side who needed
[1:16:20] deliverance and these storm was not
[1:16:22] going to be an excuse Jesus tiredness
[1:16:25] was not going to be an excuse the Bible
[1:16:28] said he maybe see that Gina was so tired
[1:16:30] the word carried they use in the
[1:16:32] original language meant physically the
[1:16:35] lift
[1:16:35] so they physically lifted Jesus into the
[1:16:39] boat but you were so focused and
[1:16:42] delivering that one man
[1:16:43] the same he didn't let inspire this B's
[1:16:46] excuse the storm was an excuse and when
[1:16:49] he got to the other side there's a man
[1:16:51] screaming out for help with demons on
[1:16:53] him with name Legion and the Emotiv
[1:17:00] demons he had was also no excuse because
[1:17:02] when Jesus came to deliver there's no
[1:17:05] excuse he come to deliver and when Corps
[1:17:09] come to set you free the odds to be
[1:17:11] against you but there's no excuse you're
[1:17:14] gonna be deliver can the church same
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:25] she may be seated could he take some
[1:17:29] more on a drive his home this morning
[1:17:31] but the balancer let's compare something
[1:17:33] he said let's let s let us make a
[1:17:35] comparison let's compete a life of
[1:17:39] seeing Paul Paul the Apostle to the rich
[1:17:42] young ruler listen carefully to the
[1:17:45] Prophet he said the same light struck
[1:17:47] both men both had the same invitation
[1:17:52] from Jesus Christ the port was well
[1:17:56] trained in the scriptures they were poor
[1:17:59] theologians remember Jesus other young
[1:18:02] rich ruler keep the commandments he said
[1:18:04] what I've done these things from my
[1:18:05] youth he was a trained man so as Paul
[1:18:09] both were well trained in Scripture Paul
[1:18:12] we supposed to come early and he was to
[1:18:14] estrange Scripture but a well trained
[1:18:16] both of them had the word listen
[1:18:18] carefully one handed from knowledge the
[1:18:22] other had it from the gym of life in it
[1:18:25] so when the light flashed across in
[1:18:27] front of Paul he said Lord who are you
[1:18:29] he said I'm Jesus Here I am and he was
[1:18:33] ready the light struck both men one was
[1:18:35] Germanized
[1:18:37] and the other was not that's the way it
[1:18:40] is church spiritual and chillerz natural
[1:18:44] that's why brother Branham talks said in
[1:18:46] every church there are three kinds of
[1:18:48] believers so you can't get upset when we
[1:18:51] preach as hard as we can to liberate and
[1:18:54] people can meet the mark because in
[1:18:56] every church there are three kinds of
[1:18:59] believers is anybody with me this is the
[1:19:02] Prophet the rich man had his excuse he
[1:19:08] couldn't do it he was too weighed down
[1:19:10] with too many friends of the world
[1:19:14] remember Jesus discerned he said I kept
[1:19:17] his cell all you have gifted upon follow
[1:19:21] me and he couldn't do it and by the bath
[1:19:25] he couldn't do it because he had an
[1:19:27] excuse and after I said everything you
[1:19:30] cannot do there will be an excuse
[1:19:33] there's a reason for it so this man
[1:19:36] walked away sorrowful Jesus loved him
[1:19:41] but he had so many excuses he couldn't
[1:19:44] do it
[1:19:45] but the Bannock said notice the rich man
[1:19:48] had his excuses listen carefully he
[1:19:51] never forsake his testimony this is
[1:19:52] powerful he's in church living me but we
[1:19:57] find out that he went to great business
[1:19:59] he had knowledge he went to such a place
[1:20:02] till he had so much increase till he had
[1:20:04] to build new bands to put things in and
[1:20:07] when he died on some bachelor priest
[1:20:10] with his cover turn around preach his
[1:20:12] funeral no doubt and when he did he said
[1:20:15] they might have put the flags at
[1:20:16] half-mast mr. brand and said our dear
[1:20:19] beloved brother mayor of this city now
[1:20:23] he is in the arms of Almighty because he
[1:20:25] was such a great member of the church he
[1:20:29] did so and so and so and the Bible says
[1:20:32] the prophets in hand he lifted up his
[1:20:35] eyes being in torment and remember he
[1:20:39] still wanted to hold his profession in
[1:20:42] hell he seen Lazarus in the bosom of
[1:20:45] Abraham and he said father Abraham and
[1:20:47] where the brand took that he said still
[1:20:50] calling him father so what he knew or
[1:20:53] what he lived was so ingrained in him he
[1:20:56] had intellectually but I said he took
[1:20:59] his knowledge and winter and
[1:21:01] intellectual Church I went the light
[1:21:04] struck him he didn't get down but the
[1:21:07] brother said if that isn't a modern
[1:21:08] trend of the church today no matter what
[1:21:12] God flashes across their path the pillar
[1:21:16] of fire or whatever else it might be
[1:21:18] they're still with their knowledge they
[1:21:21] can explain it away and go to the
[1:21:24] intellectual group for some social
[1:21:27] standing listen to the Prophet
[1:21:29] if this doesn't apply to this day
[1:21:31] hallelujah
[1:21:33] but listen to the Prophet but Paul was
[1:21:35] already in the social standing with
[1:21:37] great knowledge a great scholar under
[1:21:40] Gamaliel a right hand to the high
[1:21:42] priests
[1:21:43] in so much till he went to the priests
[1:21:45] and that orders to put all them holy
[1:21:47] rollers in jail but when the light
[1:21:51] struck his path and he seemed that the
[1:21:53] same power of fire that led Israel to
[1:21:56] the wilderness was Jesus Christ he
[1:21:58] forsook all that he knowed and he came
[1:22:01] to the life and church say Amen
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:05] hallelujah glory glory glory my no more
[1:22:15] excuses from the message of wedding
[1:22:18] supper I just want to touch a
[1:22:20] description a little bit but about said
[1:22:22] as soon as the invitation was mean and
[1:22:24] giving out any excuses was made oh yes
[1:22:27] one married a wife or the other brought
[1:22:28] some oxen you know the story but that's
[1:22:30] the way it is today God made the supper
[1:22:33] ready
[1:22:33] send the preacher to preach defeat what
[1:22:36] happened oh I can't go because I'm a
[1:22:38] deacon in another church I just couldn't
[1:22:40] do that well I couldn't go because it
[1:22:42] would lower my prestige the Prophet said
[1:22:44] your prestige oh I couldn't go because I
[1:22:46] don't believe them all holy rollers
[1:22:48] that's acting like that I'm gonna live

[1:22:57] night I can go to church that's excuses
[1:23:01] today oh I'm afraid my husband wouldn't
[1:23:04] like it
[1:23:04] I'm afraid my wife would kick me out of
[1:23:06] the house she ought to if that's the
[1:23:08] kind of man you are
[1:23:10] that's right there you are excuses made
[1:23:13] many of them we could name excuses and
[1:23:16] when I said that was done from Luther on
[1:23:18] down to Wesley's age all kinds of
[1:23:20] excuses oh well because other things to
[1:23:24] do but then when the silver come back
[1:23:26] and said I done all this and they cut
[1:23:27] all excuses he said watch what he said
[1:23:29] to the preacher now he said supper is
[1:23:31] already fixed it's already past time in
[1:23:34] other words time is already gone there's
[1:23:36] no more time left to say run quickly I'm

[1:23:42] knock on the doors go wake up the people
[1:23:44] tell them time is at hand

[1:23:50] and brother branham said people are
[1:23:51] crying oh what's the matter with you
[1:23:53] preacher he said that's the light of the
[1:23:55] Bible go get the lame and the halt and
[1:23:59] an invitation church is going out this
[1:24:02] morning but I ran him in the message a
[1:24:06] blushing prophet he said it ought to be
[1:24:09] the happiest time in the world for the
[1:24:11] Christian times are going to change the
[1:24:14] all's gonna become young oh my dad's
[1:24:17] gonna freak away sickness will be no
[1:24:19] more no more prayer meetings for the
[1:24:22] sick no more parameters for the loss but
[1:24:24] God shall come and take the elect away
[1:24:27] from the four winds of the earth and
[1:24:29] shall gather them under his wings and we
[1:24:31] live and reign with him forever in his
[1:24:33] heaven oh brother sister friend of mine
[1:24:36] if you are not prepared tonight me
[1:24:40] you'll be prepared at this hour I give
[1:24:43] you an invitation to come to Christ
[1:24:45] Jesus tonight and receive you that's
[1:24:48] been different you wouldn't know that
[1:24:50] you're not where you should be with God
[1:24:52] these are the prophets would I invite
[1:24:54] you to the altar with myself and invite
[1:24:57] every one of you here to come here and
[1:25:00] not only see but to stay here until God
[1:25:04] has cleanse your soul from everything
[1:25:08] that's unlike him until you can go out
[1:25:11] of here a new person not with a corn
[1:25:14] plaster on but go out of here with a
[1:25:17] blood transfusion
[1:25:18] that purifies your blood and gives you
[1:25:22] new life and new hope go out with the
[1:25:25] baptism of the Holy Spirit go out not
[1:25:29] shouting not dancing not so much damned
[1:25:32] things are alright they all belong in
[1:25:34] the church they all belong in the Bible
[1:25:37] what I'm talking about is the Holy
[1:25:39] Spirit God's love can the church say man
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:48] but the Branham goes on in the wedding
[1:25:52] supper speaking about the robe he said
[1:25:55] how would it be if you get invited to
[1:25:58] this wedding supper and there's somebody
[1:26:00] sitting out at a fancy suit
[1:26:02] on this table and somebody with rags on
[1:26:04] this table and this one wearing what
[1:26:06] they want so he said it was the custom
[1:26:08] and the tradition and when you come to
[1:26:10] the house you are given a robe so that
[1:26:13] every single person who comes into the
[1:26:15] supper is looking the same way I mean
[1:26:20] the banham said that robe is nothing but
[1:26:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:26:26] when you come in the right way you
[1:26:28] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:32] but it's very difficult to preach the
[1:26:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't
[1:26:36] have it or if you've never experienced
[1:26:38] it you have to find a way to build a
[1:26:40] bridge above it who tried to dig on it
[1:26:43] but we want to go through weather kindly
[1:26:45] until every last one is sealed into the
[1:26:49] kingdom can the church say Amen to the
[1:26:52] invitation that out tonight friends and
[1:26:55] the call is out to see who would respond
[1:26:58] to the call and the angel of the Lord is
[1:27:01] here and he's handing out rose he's
[1:27:04] handing out the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:06] Ghost he is the one to give the
[1:27:08] experience not the preacher but he is
[1:27:11] the one but the man said that robe is a
[1:27:12] type that of Elijah and Elijah of Christ
[1:27:17] and His Church
[1:27:18] now when that mantle was dropped down
[1:27:20] the church was supposed to wrap itself
[1:27:22] under that canopy put on the whole armor
[1:27:25] of God but on the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:28] not just on the freshmen on the inner
[1:27:31] man so it'll be in the control tower
[1:27:35] and it's something that when every man
[1:27:38] has been invited by the pelham said you
[1:27:40] can go by the door of the church if you
[1:27:43] go by the door of the church you'll get
[1:27:44] mixed up in theology he said I am the
[1:27:50] door to the ship food
[1:27:52] he said it must be that you go through
[1:27:55] Christ but the man said he honest wonder
[1:27:58] how Jesus could be the door to the sheep
[1:28:00] fall and he brought out that the
[1:28:02] Shepherd would leave as the door now
[1:28:05] when the sheep come in he would lay
[1:28:06] across the entrance as the door so that
[1:28:10] if a wolf or anything try to get in you
[1:28:12] have to go through him and he is singing
[1:28:15] that you have to go to Christ it's not
[1:28:18] the church you go to it's not to your
[1:28:20] pastor is you must go through Christ you
[1:28:25] must go through the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:27] Ghost you must add the life it must be a
[1:28:29] living faith must be a living the virtue
[1:28:32] must be a living knowledge must be
[1:28:34] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:28:35] kindness charity there's no other way
[1:28:38] can the church say Amen there they will
[1:28:45] when this robe come on but the balance
[1:28:46] said I don't mean some big robe that's
[1:28:48] some company made out here that's on the
[1:28:51] outside for man to be seen but the road
[1:28:53] that Christ gives you he said you will
[1:28:59] be said the Holy Ghost that was in
[1:29:01] Christ comes into the believer that's
[1:29:03] got the invitation to the supper how
[1:29:07] many bad I said when that rope comes in
[1:29:08] there there's a little hidden power that
[1:29:11] comes down in your heart that all the
[1:29:13] devil in hell can't make you doubt it
[1:29:15] that hidden power not with a great big
[1:29:19] something across your forehead and a
[1:29:21] Doctor of Divinity it's an inside hidden
[1:29:24] power it's been caught program since the
[1:29:27] first lamb was slain in the Garden of
[1:29:29] Eden Samson had he had a hidden power
[1:29:32] what was it a touch of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:34] and by the Broncos in the talk was
[1:29:37] Sandi's head Samson had shoulders he's
[1:29:39] anything down shoulders like a make a
[1:29:40] plan and oh he said Samson was a little
[1:29:42] bitty mama's boy
[1:29:43] a little curly-headed shrimp he said
[1:29:47] that's what fool the people he was just
[1:29:49] an ordinary boy and had seven little
[1:29:51] curls hanging down his back looking like
[1:29:53] a little that's right everybody
[1:29:56] would laugh at him a type of the Holy
[1:29:58] Ghost Church and he was a weakling but
[1:30:00] when the hour come and God wanted to
[1:30:02] use him he was a giant brother God wants
[1:30:05] a church that he can lay his hand on I
[1:30:08] don't care how little it is to watch
[1:30:10] recut it in my name I'll be in their
[1:30:12] midst
[1:30:13] not just speak it then you see when we
[1:30:15] got in his name kind of church amen
[1:30:17] oh you made me see that
[1:30:20] he said I could see Samson he was on his
[1:30:23] Road to see his girlfriend little
[1:30:25] boy his little mummy fix his little
[1:30:27] curls up for the red moms and he was
[1:30:30] going to see his little girlfriend and a
[1:30:32] great big lion run out and roll at him
[1:30:34] he was helpless and the Bible said of
[1:30:36] the Spirit of God came on him and he
[1:30:38] grabbed that lion like was a little goat
[1:30:40] and toy into what a man he was when the
[1:30:44] Spirit of God come on him he had a
[1:30:46] hidden power that had been given him
[1:30:48] well that seems part of God is the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost it's a hidden power yes and he's
[1:30:54] food a lion as if it would have been a
[1:30:57] kid how powerful he was cuz he had a
[1:30:59] hidden power
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:05] ma can the church say man it's a power
[1:31:09] of the Holy Ghost that's broken by
[1:31:11] divine grace let me say that again it's
[1:31:14] the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:31:16] brought in by divine grace by God our
[1:31:19] Father that fill the individual with his
[1:31:22] presence you shall receive life eternal
[1:31:25] life so we God's own life dwelling in
[1:31:28] you oh what a hidden power can the
[1:31:31] church see man oh my somebody say man
[1:31:35] but the Branham calls on Daniel had it
[1:31:37] when the Lions run at him the hidden
[1:31:39] power sword itself and the Lions got
[1:31:42] scared
[1:31:43] Daniel had some hidden power the Hebrew
[1:31:45] children had some hidden power when the
[1:31:48] fires hazard to burn them it was hotter
[1:31:50] than the fire was the hidden power was
[1:31:52] hotter than the fire in a fiery furnace
[1:31:57] my my my
[1:31:59] pizza had it after Pentecost and when he
[1:32:02] went to the kid called beautiful dearly
[1:32:04] the man crippled his mother's womb said
[1:32:06] silver and gold have I none but I got
[1:32:09] some hidden power I will give you if you
[1:32:11] believe it
[1:32:12] and he picked him up by the hand and
[1:32:14] said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up
[1:32:16] and walk and you know what he projected
[1:32:18] hidden power and when that man's ankle
[1:32:21] bones got strong he leaped in the air
[1:32:23] like a heart and began to jump and
[1:32:26] praise God you know what it's all about
[1:32:27] it's a hidden power but the branch said
[1:32:30] that's the robe that was handed out how

[1:34:11] experience with God and receiving the
[1:34:13] Holy Ghost if the brand said is a theme
[1:34:17] of every apostle have you received the
[1:34:20] Holy Ghost since you believe Gauri's
[1:34:22] acts 19 but about a picture message what
[1:34:27] the Holy Ghost was given before he said
