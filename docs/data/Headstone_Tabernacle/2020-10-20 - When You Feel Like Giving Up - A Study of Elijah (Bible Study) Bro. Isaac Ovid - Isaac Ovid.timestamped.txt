[8:00] amen are you happy to be here this
[8:02] evening thank you brother anthony god
[8:03] bless you
[8:04] church uh certainly a great privilege
[8:07] to be able to gather one more time in
[8:09] his presence
[8:11] and together in this way um it almost
[8:13] feels as if we've been doing this for a
[8:15] very very long time
[8:17] as you know we have taken his steps you
[8:20] know during his whole time of
[8:21] uncertainty to be certain of god
[8:23] so at this time let us just borrow our
[8:25] heads for word of prayer
[8:27] as we welcome his holy spirit
[8:30] and commit the study tonight into his
[8:33] hands
[8:34] gracious heavenly father we deem it a
[8:36] great privilege tonight
[8:38] lord to be able to gather in one mind
[8:41] and in one accord to
[8:42] get a word from you a word of
[8:44] encouragement from you to think
[8:46] that lord you would take your thoughts
[8:49] and you would put it in the form of the
[8:51] word
[8:52] law that at any time we can get a
[8:55] glimpse
[8:55] into the way you think the way you
[8:57] operate lord you
[9:00] spoke through your prophets and your
[9:02] apostles and your
[9:03] representatives through different
[9:05] dispensations lord
[9:06] about how you think and how you operate
[9:09] and you even went on to say for my
[9:11] thoughts are not your thoughts and
[9:12] neither are my ways your ways for the
[9:15] heavens i had on the earth so my
[9:17] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[9:18] lord and father lord we
[9:21] are so drawn to be closer to you
[9:24] lord through the struggles of life and
[9:27] trying to
[9:28] make ends meet as it were trying to
[9:31] do what we need to do lord to
[9:34] lord to line up with your word for the
[9:36] hour lord to be ready
[9:38] to give an answer lord for this great
[9:41] message that
[9:42] you have placed in our hands lord it was
[9:44] not our desire
[9:46] lord that brought this to us but lord
[9:48] your love reached out to us lord the
[9:51] prophet said that the message would find
[9:53] its self in the hands of to be
[9:55] destinated and we
[9:56] lord we did nothing to deserve it
[9:58] there's there's not there's none of us
[10:00] that are worthy tonight but we thank you
[10:01] for your grace for your love for your
[10:04] lord your your your love that is so vast
[10:06] that
[10:07] lord you you you died and lord
[10:10] when you look through this blood that
[10:12] speaks better
[10:13] things for us you don't see our mistakes
[10:16] and our failures lord and
[10:17] father we are so grateful tonight that
[10:19] you are our healer
[10:20] you are our redeemer you are restorer
[10:23] lord you encourage us when
[10:25] lord we are down father and there are
[10:28] times when we are down
[10:29] there are times that we are in our
[10:31] valley there are times that we go
[10:33] through our
[10:33] different issues and father i don't know
[10:36] every issue here tonight but
[10:37] may tonight's teaching be lord a little
[10:40] different kind of teaching law that
[10:42] would
[10:42] really encourage your people lord and
[10:45] and and challenge them and
[10:46] and and help them to understand lord how
[10:49] you have operated true
[10:51] lord all of the ages we commit this
[10:52] study into your hands may you bless your
[10:54] people tonight in the
[10:55] precious name of jesus christ amen and
[10:57] amen amen
[10:59] well we thank god uh for another time
[11:03] another
[11:03] another bible study and an opportunity
[11:05] for us to come together
[11:07] uh in this way and i was sharing
[11:10] with brother ovid and i had mentioned it
[11:13] to myself as well
[11:15] um this has been quite a journey uh
[11:17] through scripture and i trust
[11:19] that you have also taken this to heart
[11:22] and
[11:22] take time to reflect on what god has
[11:26] been doing
[11:26] for us and through us and um and i
[11:30] encourage you
[11:31] uh to if you have not done if you have
[11:34] but but but when you can you make the
[11:36] time
[11:36] to go back and listen uh to both the
[11:39] bible studies as well as these
[11:41] there's a lot of food there's a lot of
[11:43] things
[11:45] that are that are said that the holy
[11:47] spirit brings out
[11:48] that are not planned that are not
[11:50] scripted
[11:51] and when you go back and you look at it
[11:53] and you look at it again and you look at
[11:54] it again
[11:55] you see more and more and more you know
[11:57] so i want to encourage you
[11:58] uh let the word be your source of
[12:00] inspiration let the word
[12:01] be your guide uh let the word be your
[12:03] place of refuge you know so
[12:05] may the lord bless you tonight as we
[12:08] about to approach the text
[12:10] i uh i had originally
[12:13] um desired uh after
[12:16] last week uh to to pursue
[12:20] a direction in solomona proverbs and i
[12:23] still
[12:27] that will not be tonight i feel led to
[12:30] go back
[12:31] into uh the book of kings
[12:35] i want to kind of draw something there
[12:36] because i think there's so many things
[12:38] that are happening
[12:39] that i want to be able to by the grace
[12:41] of god
[12:42] get some encouragement for us um in
[12:45] there tonight so
[12:46] we're gonna find our reading very
[12:48] familiar scripture but i just want to
[12:50] take our time
[12:52] and uh and go through it again
[12:55] so we will be in first kings 18
[12:58] tonight so i trust you have your bibles
[13:01] and uh we'll be in first kings
[13:03] 18 tonight you're going to touch on 18
[13:08] and we're going to touch on 19 tonight
[13:12] is everybody here on me i don't know it
[13:14] looks as if my connection might be
[13:16] sticking at times
[13:27] but anthony are you hear me
[13:38] we hand you clearly isaiah okay
[13:41] all right great all right so we are
[13:44] in the book of uh first kings 18
[13:48] and in the interest of time i'm not
[13:51] going to
[13:51] go back into 17 but uh chapter 17 of
[13:55] first
[13:56] kings is the introduction of elijah so
[13:58] i'm going to just quickly go through
[13:59] that because we really want to focus on
[14:01] the team but
[14:02] you know if you go back to the to
[14:04] chapter 17
[14:05] it is when we see the introduction of
[14:07] elijah he comes
[14:09] out of out of nowhere there's no
[14:12] uh there's no history of him growing up
[14:14] we have new information
[14:16] about where he went to school we have
[14:17] new information about um
[14:19] how we lived all of a sudden elijah who
[14:22] was of the tishbi just comes out of
[14:24] nowhere
[14:24] and says as the lord god of israel live
[14:27] it before whom i stand there shall be
[14:28] not
[14:29] be there will be what you are in these
[14:31] years according to my word
[14:33] and that word of prophecy would have
[14:35] just hung over
[14:37] all of the land and we know that god
[14:40] would have guided him
[14:41] uh to the brook of cherith where he was
[14:44] to hide and god was going to feed him
[14:46] and take care of him
[14:47] and when the brook found the water
[14:49] disappeared because
[14:51] of the whole drought etcetera god sent
[14:54] him to the white officers arafat
[14:55] who took care of him there um her son
[14:58] was sick gravely
[14:59] died and and came back to life um
[15:02] and and we know at chapter 18 verse one
[15:06] and we're going to take our time and go
[15:07] to it
[15:08] we are really trying to to bring us to a
[15:10] spot here with this teaching
[15:12] and if i were to give this teaching a
[15:14] thought tonight it's
[15:15] it's when you feel like giving up that's
[15:18] it that's the title tonight when you
[15:19] feel like giving up
[15:20] a study of elijah all right so when you
[15:22] feel like giving up
[15:24] a study of elijah
[15:27] uh so first kings 18 and verse 1
[15:31] and it came to pass after many days
[15:35] that the word of the lord came to elijah
[15:37] this is 18 verse 1
[15:38] in the third year saying go
[15:42] show thyself unto ahab and i will send
[15:44] rain
[15:45] upon the earth and i want us to first
[15:48] notice here in 18
[15:50] 1 that the word of the lord
[15:53] came to elijah in the third year
[15:56] concerning this matter of the rin
[16:00] you know and uh when you read the
[16:01] prophet's message
[16:03] you will see that there's one time and i
[16:06] love the quote where brother branham
[16:07] said
[16:08] he hadn't seen the angel for six months
[16:12] and he saw the angel the angel just
[16:14] looked at him
[16:15] turned around and walked away you know
[16:18] because many times
[16:19] people create the impression and and
[16:22] ministers in particular are guilty
[16:24] of creating this this impression so to
[16:27] speak
[16:28] that god is speaking to them every day
[16:30] 24 7.
[16:32] um and the prophet never gave that he
[16:35] never suggested that he never presented
[16:37] that
[16:38] we find elijah here on this matter
[16:41] hadn't heard a direction on how to act
[16:44] on this
[16:45] for about three years so i want us to
[16:48] understand that there are periods of
[16:50] time
[16:51] in our christian journey when
[16:54] uh it will be as if you don't hear a
[16:57] word
[16:57] on a specific matter that you're going
[16:59] through but your
[17:00] fate in the word of promise is what
[17:02] keeps you going you know so
[17:04] i'm building into something here now you
[17:05] know so i want us to understand that
[17:08] god's silence does not mean his
[17:11] disapproval
[17:12] or even his approval because of god's
[17:15] sovereignty
[17:16] he could choose to speak or he could
[17:17] choose to be silent
[17:19] you know and many times it is a case of
[17:21] us
[17:22] creating expectations and a big part of
[17:24] this teaching tonight
[17:25] is about managing our expectations
[17:29] uh the only way you could ever be
[17:31] disappointed
[17:32] is when an expectation is not met
[17:36] and many times we create false
[17:40] expectations of situations of people
[17:43] around us
[17:44] and and and sometimes we may have the
[17:46] best expectations but they may just not
[17:48] be
[17:48] the right expectations and i want us to
[17:50] understand
[17:51] that distinction between what we can
[17:53] control and what we cannot control
[17:56] all right so we are building here so so
[17:59] and it came to the past after many days
[18:01] that the word of the lord came to elijah
[18:03] in the third year so three years have
[18:04] passed and he's now getting a direction
[18:06] from the lord on it saying go
[18:08] show yourself unto ahab and i will send
[18:10] rain
[18:11] upon the earth verse 2
[18:14] and elijah went to show himself unto
[18:16] ahab
[18:17] and there was a sore famine in samaria
[18:21] now i want us to understand the context
[18:25] here this whole
[18:26] situation of famine and all this is out
[18:29] of god's displeasure in the rulership
[18:32] and leadership of ahab
[18:34] uh at the end of verse 16 we would see
[18:36] that ahab
[18:38] had a unique distinction of being named
[18:40] the worst king
[18:42] that israel would have ever seen that as
[18:44] bad as those who were before
[18:46] he was able to break the world record
[18:48] and be much worse
[18:50] and his choice of his wife was
[18:53] his decision that was counted as his
[18:56] worst decision
[18:57] because he married a wife who was a
[18:59] idolater idol worshipper
[19:01] who introduced baal and ashira and when
[19:04] if you recall our study of jehu and
[19:06] nebot
[19:08] the bible directly said that jezebel
[19:11] was directly responsible for the issues
[19:14] in ahab's life
[19:15] all right so i want us to understand as
[19:18] we're building this this is the backdrop
[19:20] as we're going here right
[19:21] so so verse two and elijah went to show
[19:24] himself unto ahab and there was a sore
[19:26] famine
[19:26] in samaria and ahab called obadiah
[19:30] which was the governor of his house so
[19:33] ahab called
[19:34] obadiah which was the governor of his
[19:36] house now obadiah feared the lord
[19:39] greatly so i
[19:43] first let let's let's let's continue
[19:46] verse 4 for it was so that when jezebel
[19:48] cut off the prophets of the lord that
[19:51] obadiah took 100 prophets
[19:53] and hid them by 50 in a cave and fed
[19:56] them
[19:57] with bread and water and i find it very
[20:00] interesting because many times we
[20:01] we brush through these scriptures and
[20:05] we don't really slow down to really
[20:07] process it here it is
[20:08] the worst king the very worst king of
[20:11] israel has ever seen
[20:13] that god is completely upset with that
[20:16] has introduced idol worshipper
[20:18] the idol worship his right hand man so
[20:21] to speak the governor of his house
[20:23] is actually a believer i wanted to see
[20:26] this for a second
[20:27] the governor of his house is actually a
[20:29] believer
[20:30] whose understanding of the word and
[20:33] scripture
[20:34] is such that he is like a secret agent
[20:36] in ahab's house
[20:37] we understand that god operates that way
[20:39] he is placed there
[20:41] but what i find is noble is that even
[20:43] though he is in ahab's house he hasn't
[20:45] lost his values
[20:47] he hasn't lost his compass he hasn't
[20:49] lost
[20:50] what he knows to be the truth because he
[20:53] as governor of ahab's house
[20:54] understand the position now understand
[20:56] the role he feels
[20:57] understand his access to what ahab would
[21:01] say and what jezebel would speak about
[21:03] understand that
[21:04] he may have been first to hear about the
[21:06] attack that would come
[21:07] to all of the prophets and yet he is
[21:10] in that position of leadership in an
[21:13] environment that is not ideal
[21:15] necessarily for a believer so to speak
[21:18] he makes a decision to go against what
[21:21] his
[21:21] quote-unquote master would want for the
[21:23] sake of
[21:25] his testimony his belief and of the
[21:27] prophetic class of that day
[21:29] so i want us to notice that many times
[21:32] we find ourselves in situations be it a
[21:34] job
[21:35] be it whatever it is where decisions
[21:38] will have to be made
[21:40] things will be taking place and it takes
[21:42] wisdom wisdom to know how to operate
[21:45] in that particular situation the most
[21:47] important point being here is that
[21:48] there's nothing to suggest
[21:50] that obadiah was being corrupted by what
[21:52] ahab was doing
[21:53] so i want to challenge us because i
[21:55] believe in practical scripture
[21:57] all right i believe in in the simplicity
[21:59] of the word
[22:00] to impact our day-to-day life i remember
[22:03] telling young people
[22:04] there are so many jobs that exist it is
[22:07] important for you to find a place that
[22:09] doesn't compromise what you believe it
[22:12] is important for you
[22:13] to be in a place that doesn't compromise
[22:15] because your blessings
[22:16] will not come from compromised
[22:17] situations you have to manage your
[22:20] relations you know you need to
[22:21] manage who you spend time with so here
[22:23] it was we don't know what situation led
[22:25] to obadiah being here
[22:26] but obadiah has has ended up in a
[22:29] position
[22:30] as a christian having a testimony in so
[22:32] much that he is operating that
[22:34] he has trust from ahab all right
[22:37] so verse 5 and ahab said unto obadiah go
[22:40] into the land
[22:41] unto all fountains of water and onto all
[22:44] brooks
[22:45] per adventure which means perhaps or or
[22:47] by chance
[22:48] we may find grass to save the horses and
[22:51] mules that we lose not all the peace
[22:54] so from this we see that the famine is
[22:57] so severe
[22:58] or so famine as the scripture said that
[23:00] the animals were beginning to die
[23:02] and ahab's concern for the animals was
[23:04] let us go and hunt and see if we find
[23:06] land
[23:07] let's find some place so that we could
[23:08] save some of the animals
[23:10] so verse 6 so they divided the land
[23:12] between them to pass throughout it
[23:15] ahab went one way by himself and obadiah
[23:18] went another way by himself
[23:20] that speaks of trust all right when you
[23:22] trust somebody you don't have to watch
[23:24] over their shoulder all the time
[23:25] so it means that ahab although obadiah
[23:28] was a secret agent
[23:30] for the lord under his care he was
[23:32] operating in such a way
[23:34] that ahab didn't have to worry what the
[23:36] agenda of obadiah would be
[23:38] because obadiah could have been left on
[23:39] his own i want us to just see these
[23:40] subtle messages
[23:42] here in scripture verse seven and as
[23:45] obadiah was in the way
[23:47] meaning in his journey behold elijah met
[23:50] him
[23:51] and he knew him in other words he
[23:53] recognized him
[23:54] and fell on his face and said ardou that
[23:58] my lord elijah
[24:00] so i want us to just build this because
[24:01] i'm going somewhere i don't want to
[24:02] spend
[24:03] too much time here because there were
[24:04] real places really we're trying to get
[24:05] to to
[24:06] to chapter 19 but i want i don't want to
[24:09] take it for granted
[24:10] that people have read this that people
[24:12] have studied this that people also
[24:13] understand this i rather
[24:15] take the time and go through it so that
[24:17] we could be grounded in this because
[24:18] when we speak of elijah friends
[24:21] remember we are in the days of elijah
[24:24] elijah as a prophet and the prophetic
[24:25] ministry of elijah is the only ministry
[24:27] that he could find repeated through
[24:29] scripture we have said it before elijah
[24:31] elisha
[24:33] as john the baptist as brother branham
[24:35] and then as elijah to the jews
[24:37] so the spirit of elijah the nature of
[24:39] elijah the
[24:40] operations of elijah is important for us
[24:43] to understand
[24:44] the spirit of the man because the spirit
[24:46] of elijah
[24:47] is what we are dealing with even to this
[24:49] day now okay
[24:51] so he said i doubt that my lord elijah
[24:55] verse 8 he answered him i
[24:56] am you know i am go tell thy lord behold
[25:00] elijah is here you know i just i just
[25:02] like that i
[25:03] i just like that statement because when
[25:06] you when you understand the context
[25:08] ahab was very aware that is elijah who
[25:12] has made this statement there'll be no
[25:13] due
[25:14] no rain until my word release it in
[25:16] other words i'm
[25:17] locking it up until i speak so the key
[25:20] to unlocking it
[25:21] was the word of elijah and i want to see
[25:23] the type true
[25:24] even our d the key to unlocking the
[25:27] rapture
[25:27] is the word of elijah the key to the
[25:30] adoption
[25:30] of the bride is the word of elijah the
[25:33] key to unlocking the the rain the
[25:35] lottery and the spiritual
[25:36] the dynamics is the word of elijah so
[25:39] the prophet would say rapture and faith
[25:41] is laying in your message so right now
[25:43] things are still locked up
[25:44] waiting for the word of elijah come on
[25:47] now
[25:47] to be handled by some sons all right
[25:50] because he said
[25:51] it's there somebody gonna pick it up all
[25:53] right okay
[25:54] so go tell thy lord behold elijah say
[25:57] that is
[25:58] i call that bad man talk because ahab
[26:00] has been looking for elijah and elijah's
[26:03] saying elijah is here
[26:04] all right so you have to look no more i
[26:06] reach all right
[26:08] and listen listen to obadiah's response
[26:11] all right
[26:12] verse nine and he said what have i what
[26:15] have i
[26:16] sinned in other words what have i done
[26:18] what did i
[26:19] do all right that dogwood has deliver
[26:23] thy servant into the hand of ahab to
[26:25] slay me in other words
[26:26] what have i done i was having a good day
[26:29] i was listening to my master looking for
[26:30] water
[26:31] what have i done that you come to set it
[26:34] up that ahab killed me
[26:36] and he goes on verse 10 as the lord
[26:39] as the lord thy god live it there is no
[26:41] nation or kingdom
[26:43] i want us to understand the level that
[26:45] ahab went to
[26:46] as the lord thy god live it there is no
[26:48] nation or kingdom
[26:50] whether my lord had not sent to seek
[26:52] thee in other words
[26:54] the known world as it were ahab had put
[26:57] a word to find elijah it was
[27:00] god's instruction that led elijah to go
[27:03] and hide
[27:03] so as the lord thy god liver there is no
[27:06] nation
[27:06] no nation no kingdom whether by lord had
[27:10] not sent a sigi
[27:11] and when they said in other words when
[27:14] they said he is not there
[27:16] he took an oath of the kingdom and
[27:18] nation
[27:19] that they found did not so he just take
[27:21] their word for it he make them swear
[27:25] put their life on the line that elijah
[27:27] is not here
[27:29] now verse 11 and now thou sayest go tell
[27:32] thy lord be holy elijah
[27:34] is here all right 12
[27:37] listen to verse 12 and it shall come to
[27:39] pass
[27:40] this is obadiah's assessment of his
[27:42] individual and it shall come to pass as
[27:44] soon
[27:44] as i am gone from thee that the spirit
[27:47] of the lord
[27:48] shall carry thee with her i know not
[27:52] and so when i come and tell ahab and he
[27:55] cannot find thee
[27:56] he will slay me but i
[27:59] thy servant fear the lord from my youth
[28:01] so obadiah is petrified
[28:03] he's had to plead his own case because
[28:06] he know the lord working with elijah
[28:08] he know with elijah everything could
[28:09] happen there's enough and the
[28:11] interesting thing is between
[28:13] verse verse 17 and 18 there is no
[28:18] explanation so to speak of the power of
[28:20] the minister of elijah really outside of
[28:22] the world and the declaration
[28:24] so it's not as if they would have seen
[28:25] it like just zipping back and forth so
[28:27] it means that obadiah is a true believer
[28:29] and you understand if god is with this
[28:30] man anything is possible right verse 13
[28:34] this is where obadiah had to pull out
[28:35] illegal documents now
[28:37] was it not told my lord what i did when
[28:39] jezebel
[28:40] slew the prophets of the lord how i hid
[28:43] a hundred men of the lord's prophets
[28:45] by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread
[28:48] and water in other words
[28:49] don't kill me this is why you i don't
[28:51] know where to kill me this is why i
[28:52] don't want to go
[28:53] and talk to ahab i don't want to deal
[28:55] with the situation and now
[28:57] thou sayest go tell thy lord behold
[28:59] elijah is here
[29:00] and he shall slay me and elijah said as
[29:03] the lord of hosts liveth
[29:05] before whom i stand i will surely
[29:08] show myself unto him today all right so
[29:11] so this put the matter to rest in
[29:13] obadiah's mind and heart you say listen
[29:15] i
[29:15] am it's important i'm on a commission i
[29:18] am operating on the instructions all
[29:20] right
[29:20] so i want and we'll see it later on in
[29:23] chapter 19
[29:24] this journey that elijah is taking
[29:28] to deal with what he's about to handle
[29:30] is scripture i want to use the term
[29:32] scripted by the lord in other words
[29:34] elijah is following a playbook
[29:36] you know we really bible says the steps
[29:38] of the righteous are ordered by god
[29:40] so elijah is walking in ordered steps he
[29:43] is not
[29:43] making this up he is not operating here
[29:46] on his own choosing now he is operating
[29:48] as god told him in other words when the
[29:50] lord told him to go and find ahab
[29:52] god would have told him this is what
[29:54] you're going to do when you meet ahab
[29:56] this is how you're going to operate and
[29:58] we'll seek confirmation of that later on
[30:01] so verse 16 so obadiah went to meet ahab
[30:04] and told him
[30:05] and ahab went to meet elijah
[30:08] and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah
[30:12] that ahab said unto him ad thou he that
[30:15] troublet israel
[30:17] you see now what is the trouble that
[30:20] elijah
[30:21] doing elijah only trying to get people
[30:23] back to god in him
[30:25] that's all elijah's motive his objective
[30:28] his desire his burden his interest
[30:31] is to get people connected back to god
[30:33] and that's what we are doing here
[30:35] tonight to get
[30:36] people connected back to god not
[30:38] connected to a church
[30:39] not connected to a group but to a
[30:41] relationship with god and that is the
[30:43] desire that elijah's operating with
[30:45] friends
[30:46] and he answered listen to his answer to
[30:49] elijah's answer in verse 18 and he
[30:51] answered
[30:51] i have not troubled israel
[30:54] but thou and thy father's house in that
[30:58] ye have forsaken
[30:59] the commandments of the lord and thou
[31:02] has
[31:02] followed bailism
[31:06] now therefore send and gather to me
[31:09] all israel unto mount carmel and the
[31:12] prophets of bell
[31:14] 450 and the prophets of the groves and i
[31:17] taught on this in a prayer prayer
[31:18] teaching
[31:19] this grove is ashira ashira is the
[31:22] female deity
[31:23] so in other words israel had gotten so
[31:26] corrupt that it was
[31:27] 450 priests who were serving the mailed
[31:31] idol bill and and another 400
[31:35] which was serving ashira the female of
[31:37] the growth
[31:38] which eat at jezebel stable so jezebel
[31:40] herself as a female what has
[31:42] been almost like a priestess of the
[31:44] grove all right so
[31:46] israel it was just horrible you have 850
[31:49] priests 458 for bail
[31:51] and 400 for shiro verse 20
[31:54] so ahab sent unto all the children of
[31:57] israel
[31:58] and gather the prophets together onto
[32:01] mount
[32:01] carmel i'm building here now
[32:05] and elijah came unto all the people
[32:08] and i would have taught this before and
[32:10] said how long
[32:11] hold ye between two opinions
[32:15] and i think i did a teaching just on
[32:16] this this issue here
[32:18] how long will you halt or they would
[32:20] have limp or move between two opinions
[32:23] if the lord be god follow him but if
[32:26] baal
[32:26] then follow him and the people answered
[32:29] him not a word
[32:32] and in processing it i'm wondering these
[32:35] people
[32:36] make no mistake about it they know their
[32:38] history
[32:39] it is one thing we know about the
[32:41] children of israel
[32:42] the tribe of judah the people of god
[32:45] they knew their history because
[32:46] up to even when jesus came he was able
[32:49] to make references
[32:50] to the queen of sheba he was able to
[32:52] make references of what would have been
[32:54] passed down
[32:55] by oral tradition what would have been
[32:57] passed down via scrolls
[32:58] so here it is they are being confronted
[33:02] with this one man called elijah
[33:05] on the one side and you have 850
[33:09] people who grew up among them people who
[33:11] grew up hearing about moses
[33:13] and abraham and for some reason they
[33:15] have lost their compass
[33:16] and the people are witnesses of this
[33:19] thing and elijah's challenging them
[33:21] how long will you haul between two
[33:24] opinions
[33:24] what this means friends is that the
[33:27] people were
[33:28] actively on one day living a certain way
[33:31] because
[33:31] it is not that they were totally sold
[33:34] out of bailism
[33:35] i want us to get it this this point here
[33:37] it is not that they were completely
[33:39] convinced to follow bill
[33:41] the reality is that people were swinging
[33:43] back and forth
[33:45] one when it was convenient for them they
[33:48] would serve god
[33:49] the god of their fathers when it was
[33:52] convenient for them
[33:53] they would follow the old way but when
[33:55] it's convenient for them they would
[33:56] follow realism
[33:58] and it's a crisis today because we see
[34:01] it in the church
[34:02] we see it in homes we see it in families
[34:05] and it's manifested visibly and it's
[34:07] manifested invisibly
[34:10] so i want to challenge destiny as we
[34:12] pursue this because this
[34:14] is the pain i call it the opinion of
[34:15] elijah
[34:17] elijah is now expressing the inner
[34:20] anguish in him because he is seeing
[34:23] what is in front of him that these
[34:25] people are caught
[34:26] between two masters they are caught
[34:29] between servant
[34:30] god and the things of the world the
[34:33] court being serving
[34:35] righteousness and serving the chaos that
[34:38] is out there i want us to nail this down
[34:40] because if we don't see this and we just
[34:42] take it
[34:42] it is another study and are we just
[34:45] trying to
[34:46] think i want us to look at ourselves
[34:48] here friends
[34:51] and then elijah then said elijah until
[34:54] the people i
[34:55] even i only remain a prophet of the lord
[34:58] but bears prophets are 450 men
[35:02] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[35:05] and let them choose one block for
[35:08] themselves in other words
[35:10] elijah for this whole part that we're
[35:12] going through here is laying out the
[35:14] sequence of events
[35:16] because brother branham would say that
[35:17] this particular situation here
[35:19] was was one of the greatest ever in
[35:21] history in spiritual history
[35:24] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[35:26] let them choose
[35:27] in other words i don't want them to
[35:29] accuse me of having anything to do with
[35:31] this
[35:31] let them choose one bullet for
[35:33] themselves and cut it in pieces
[35:36] and lay it on wood and put no fire under
[35:40] and i will dress the other bullock and
[35:42] lay it on wood
[35:43] and put no fire on them i don't know who
[35:47] here ever caught up an animal
[35:50] anybody ever cut about animal a whole
[35:53] are you talking about no chicken here i
[35:54] end up going oh no cut up chicken
[35:57] it's easy to get them chicken i remember
[36:00] being young and i was staying in miara i
[36:02] think dad may have went to nigeria or
[36:03] something and i was staying in miaro
[36:05] and i think we're a jew or so and some
[36:08] somehow i end up
[36:09] somewhere in mafikin and they were
[36:10] killing pigs for christmas
[36:12] or something and it was about three
[36:15] four guys trying to do this whole
[36:16] operation and
[36:18] cutting our animal up a big animal is
[36:22] working on
[36:24] cutting a a a a call up you ever see the
[36:27] size of a call
[36:31] you know the equipment they would have
[36:33] had back then so i want to paint a
[36:34] picture
[36:35] of we read through this and i want to
[36:37] see the human side of it as well
[36:40] i'm not sure i haven't studied it out
[36:42] exactly how old elijah was at this point
[36:45] in time
[36:46] but here it is i want you to see this
[36:48] scenario you have 450
[36:50] priests priests quotation mark please
[36:53] who could
[36:54] decide among themselves who cutting what
[36:56] part up
[36:57] and how they're cutting it because it's
[36:58] plenty of them
[37:00] many hands make light working or
[37:02] whatever
[37:03] so they for them is light work and
[37:06] here's this lone
[37:08] man of god i want you to see this
[37:10] scenario on the one hand
[37:12] they take in turns they have a roster
[37:14] they have a rotation who got to know the
[37:16] leg
[37:16] who's gonna decide and on the other hand
[37:19] there's this one man elijah
[37:21] i want to say fighting up with his
[37:23] bullock
[37:24] i wanted to see the picture now of how
[37:26] the odds are against elijah
[37:29] oh nobody the people not saying a word
[37:31] so there's nobody defending elijah
[37:33] i wanted to see the context no i wanted
[37:36] to see the burden of an
[37:37] elijah that he has to be committed to
[37:40] what he's doing
[37:42] he can't flick he can't fall apart he
[37:45] can't
[37:45] look at the many hands doing on the
[37:47] other side and say oh gosh
[37:49] i wish i had help anybody with me
[37:51] tonight
[37:53] if anybody wants to come and he in other
[37:55] words
[37:56] like gideon chasing the enemy the
[37:58] mission
[37:59] and the finishing of the mission and the
[38:01] objective of the mission
[38:02] is the only thing that matters and
[38:04] elijah has to be focused i want you just
[38:06] to slowly tape down and to see
[38:08] your real life scenario how sometimes
[38:11] you have things to do
[38:13] and is you alone
[38:17] you have no help
[38:20] the people who you hope to help you not
[38:22] showing up
[38:23] and your quote-unquote competition or
[38:26] what you're facing off against
[38:27] looks as if when one man tired is the
[38:30] next man to replace him is the next man
[38:32] to replace him
[38:33] and you they still saw in one leg over
[38:35] the bullock
[38:37] you have finished saw one leg yet and
[38:38] they're cutting up they're dividing
[38:40] they attacking i want to see the picture
[38:42] now
[38:44] and i will dress the other bullock and
[38:46] lay it on wood and put no fire under
[38:48] verse 24
[38:49] and call thee on the name of your gods
[38:52] and i will call on the name of the lord
[38:54] and the god that answer it by fire let
[38:57] him be god
[38:58] and all the people answered and said it
[39:00] is well spoken
[39:02] story people finally find their voice in
[39:04] other words this thing making sense
[39:06] this is pure logic so the people say
[39:08] well this thing making sense no because
[39:09] if the both sides doing this and if
[39:11] there's fire and and
[39:12] all that is happening then at least
[39:15] whoever wins this thing we can support
[39:16] it
[39:18] so elijah wasn't picking for them as
[39:20] well he was
[39:21] saying you make a choice you're halting
[39:23] between two opinions i will stop that i
[39:25] want you to decide so they say well yes
[39:27] we are willing to decide
[39:29] so understand this elijah is not doing
[39:31] this
[39:32] because he feel in alberto would say
[39:33] jewish or you're feeling kurdish or you
[39:35] want to he is doing this
[39:37] because he wants to see a change in the
[39:40] people elijah is not doing this for
[39:43] attention
[39:43] i want us to understand it he's not
[39:45] doing this because he wants recognition
[39:48] he's not doing this because he wants us
[39:49] to be talking about it tonight
[39:51] he's doing it because he's burdened by
[39:54] the bailism
[39:55] by the sin that is infiltrating the
[39:57] people of god who should be
[39:59] operating a certain way
[40:03] verse 25 and elijah said unto the
[40:06] prophets of baal
[40:07] choose you one bullock for yourselves
[40:09] and dressed at first for ye
[40:10] are many in other words he's here he's
[40:12] plenty earlier so
[40:14] elijah we see elijah that he's pretty
[40:16] much elijah here has a level of
[40:18] i i want to use the word carefully a
[40:20] level of sarcasm
[40:22] elijah has a level of confidence in his
[40:24] operation
[40:25] in other words he said olivia i gave it
[40:27] only a head start
[40:28] because it's plenty earlier
[40:31] i love it i love it i love it and that's
[40:33] the confidence you have to have
[40:34] in your position so so it's all earlier
[40:37] take a head start now it's me alone
[40:39] i don't need the answer all right so
[40:40] look at the operation of elijah here
[40:42] right
[40:43] for you many and call on the name of
[40:45] your gods but put no fire under
[40:47] verse 26 and they took the bullock which
[40:49] was given them
[40:50] and they dressed it and called i want us
[40:54] to process this now friends
[40:55] are trying to get where i'm going but i
[40:57] have to slow down here because this here
[40:59] is solid solid solid solid teaching
[41:02] and they took the bullock which was
[41:04] given them and they dressed it
[41:06] and called on the name of bell from
[41:09] morning
[41:10] even until noon brothers
[41:14] and sisters in other words for six hours
[41:18] they pray when last you pray for six
[41:22] hours
[41:25] no are pushing a push in here
[41:28] they're dead wrong but you can't tell
[41:30] them they're not convicted enough
[41:36] they this is not this is not all of the
[41:38] word this is not
[41:39] the cd very elective is possible this is
[41:42] way off the path this is you're already
[41:44] bought
[41:44] you're in the deep you're drunken and
[41:46] never let's do six hours
[41:49] talk about commitment so so i want us to
[41:51] dig here it means that people can be
[41:53] committed for the wrong thing
[41:56] people could be so convinced of the
[41:58] wrong thing
[42:00] that they're willing to do six hours
[42:05] so you see that why i want to get this
[42:08] why sincerity
[42:09] is not a measure of of your standing in
[42:12] god
[42:14] that commitment these are qualities that
[42:17] need to be directed i want to make the
[42:19] point clear
[42:20] because there are people who are
[42:21] committed to the wrong thing
[42:23] they're sincere about the wrong thing
[42:25] they have their belief of how things
[42:27] should be and things should operate
[42:29] and they don't see themselves in it and
[42:31] they measure
[42:32] and and i see it in in in in business
[42:34] all the time there's a difference
[42:36] between activity and productivity
[42:39] you're working working working working
[42:40] working and at the end of the day all
[42:42] you have is activity
[42:43] there's no productivity you they're
[42:47] filing your moving fire from here
[42:48] to here and then from back from here
[42:50] whole day moving the file
[42:51] file fire fight that's activity
[42:54] what's the value to the organization of
[42:57] moving the fire
[42:58] from one cupboard to the next government
[43:00] if anybody tell you say well i moved
[43:01] the 582 million times this week this
[43:04] year i weighed it
[43:05] what did that do to the business that is
[43:06] activity not productivity
[43:12] can we go a little a little deeper
[43:13] trying to try to to to
[43:15] this thing i see this thing really this
[43:17] thing is this thing is is is i
[43:19] sing it as if i'm there right now right
[43:21] so
[43:23] call on the name of bad from morning
[43:25] until
[43:26] noon saying oh by hear us i want us to
[43:29] understand
[43:30] these people who praying this is this is
[43:33] serious in them
[43:35] but there was no voice no any that
[43:38] answered and they
[43:39] leaped upon the altar which was made in
[43:41] other words they escalate
[43:43] they went from walking around the altar
[43:45] to going on top the altar in other words
[43:47] more commitment
[43:48] more effort more energy if you didn't
[43:51] think i believed before
[43:52] now you see i believe you see why people
[43:55] are jumping up and down until
[43:56] impressment
[43:58] because nowaday now they really in the
[44:00] spirit
[44:02] can we push further and it came to pass
[44:05] that at noon
[44:07] that elijah mocked them so elijah gave
[44:09] them six hours
[44:11] and then started
[44:15] elijah mugged them and said cry aloud i
[44:18] like it
[44:18] elijah air tried to dissuade him no he
[44:20] say listen relation turn up the volume
[44:23] my recommendation
[44:24] i hear watching earlier for six hours
[44:26] now and i think well it should increase
[44:28] the volume the
[44:28] whoever set up the amplifier system did
[44:31] not do a good job
[44:32] it is 450 or earlier and all you need
[44:36] to elevate this activity i want you
[44:39] listen and i want you to see the picture
[44:41] it's not just elijah
[44:43] and the prophets and the priests and
[44:44] eminem you have the whole of israel
[44:46] saying i want you to read the context so
[44:48] this here is
[44:49] the biggest event in years it's like a
[44:51] stadium
[44:53] the whole of israel is there watching
[44:55] this
[44:56] look as a crazy person on the one hand
[44:59] and this whole
[45:00] activity this whole long show going on
[45:02] right
[45:03] cry aloud for he is a god
[45:07] either and elijah to give them the
[45:10] options to explain to them
[45:12] in other words and you ever meet people
[45:14] who try to justify or explain sharpness
[45:17] so elijah started to explain the
[45:19] shoppiness to them so they started to
[45:21] process their own trippiness
[45:22] he said for he's a god either he is
[45:24] talking
[45:25] so because he is talking you need to
[45:28] raise your voice to get his attention or
[45:30] he is pursuing
[45:32] he running on something or he is in a
[45:35] journey
[45:38] or per adventure he sleep it and must be
[45:41] awakened
[45:42] and they cried aloud and listen listen
[45:45] and this is why when you meet people who
[45:48] who committed about the wrong thing
[45:50] there's very little you could do to
[45:51] convince them because
[45:53] under the pressure of the situation they
[45:55] take it down next level
[45:57] listen and they cut themselves after
[45:59] their manner
[46:00] in other words them fellas start to do
[46:02] blood sacrifice
[46:05] typically priests religious order does
[46:08] be in some kind of white
[46:09] garb so i want you to see the picture
[46:11] 450 jokers
[46:13] no bleeding because in a mess is a whole
[46:16] this is a horrible horrible horrible
[46:18] sight
[46:18] and yet still eternal israel they're
[46:20] still not convinced
[46:22] that this thing looked insane
[46:26] by the time we're done here everybody
[46:28] will know their story
[46:30] very well till the blood gushed out
[46:34] you know what the word gosh is mean and
[46:37] he says i mean gushing
[46:40] out upon them but brother clarence them
[46:43] fellas was this surely the level of
[46:45] commitment
[46:46] they had to this madness in them you see
[46:49] that's why i say sometimes you say a
[46:50] word to the wise insufficient
[46:52] it means that when you speak to somebody
[46:54] who is wise just the word alone is
[46:56] sufficient you know
[46:56] but you see it to the full and we're
[46:58] supposed to get into people and deal
[47:00] with fools
[47:00] you could tell them what kind of words
[47:02] you can't stop shopping that's when
[47:03] people are doing nonsense you know
[47:05] they reach a point that blood gushing is
[47:07] this
[47:08] midday is after the sun people hot
[47:13] verse 29 and it came to pass when midday
[47:16] was passed
[47:17] and they prophesied until the time of
[47:20] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[47:22] that there was neither voice nor any to
[47:25] answer
[47:26] no any that regarded listen to verse 30
[47:29] and this is a powerful lesson here and
[47:31] elijah said unto all the people come
[47:33] near unto me
[47:34] in other words if elijah didn't make
[47:37] the statement them fellas
[47:44] is elijah put an end to the foolishness
[47:47] because them fellas
[47:49] was going to continue their level of
[47:51] commitment to their nonsense was going
[47:52] to continue you know
[47:54] as saying it's triggered i wanted to
[47:56] understand that people could be
[47:57] committed to the wrong thing
[48:00] i also want you to understand how
[48:02] stubborn they were in their belief
[48:04] that they did not give up that day did
[48:06] not stop
[48:07] they didn't come to our realization that
[48:09] this is not working for us that's a very
[48:11] dangerous place to be
[48:12] when you're doing an action or an
[48:14] activity that bears no fruit
[48:16] and you don't realize that this course
[48:18] of action is not working
[48:23] albert einstein said the definition of
[48:25] insanity is doing the same thing
[48:27] and expecting a different result
[48:30] so elijah verse 30 said
[48:34] and elijah said unto all the people come
[48:36] near unto me
[48:38] and all the people came near unto him
[48:40] and he repealed the altar
[48:42] of the lord that was broken down and to
[48:45] get
[48:46] context jezebel would have ordered
[48:49] the breaking down and the destruction of
[48:52] the altars that were established
[48:59] so this is elijah i call it elijah's
[49:01] peen
[49:02] and his anguish and and and how he is
[49:05] processing things so the first thing you
[49:07] do
[49:07] you do it he restore the altar and
[49:09] that's a whole long message of himself
[49:10] and people misappropriate this but he
[49:12] restores the altar
[49:14] in other words if i have to do this
[49:16] thing it needs to be the right way
[49:18] it has to be done in the right approach
[49:20] we can't just offer sacrifice to the
[49:22] lord in any way we want to
[49:24] these altars were established for a
[49:26] reason
[49:28] the covenants between god and his church
[49:30] has been established for a reason
[49:32] the way we do certain things have been
[49:34] established for a reason
[49:36] we can't get back to where we're
[49:38] supposed to be if we don't establish the
[49:40] foundational basics and principles that
[49:43] god requires
[49:44] that's why everybody brandon preach a
[49:45] message approach to god there has to be
[49:47] an approach to god
[49:49] a way to reach him a way to get his
[49:51] attention come to church say amen
[49:54] 31 look how the lookout is being built
[49:56] and elijah took 12
[49:58] stones according to the number of the
[50:00] tribes of the sons of jacob
[50:02] in other words he taken them all the way
[50:04] back to the foundation
[50:05] and we are trying to go all the way back
[50:07] to the day of pentecost all the way
[50:09] back to the alpha church all the way
[50:11] back to the power that was there
[50:12] because that needs to be here for us to
[50:14] go where we need to go next can the
[50:15] church say amen
[50:17] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[50:20] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[50:21] jacob
[50:22] unto whom the word of the lord came
[50:24] saying israel shall be thy name
[50:26] and with the stones he built an altar in
[50:29] the name of the lord
[50:30] and he made a trench about the altar in
[50:33] other words he he
[50:34] this is i want us to catch still friends
[50:37] elijah don't have help
[50:38] up to no we see no mention of somebody
[50:42] even even in jesus day they took the
[50:45] cross
[50:45] they want to take the cross over jesus
[50:47] and put it on somebody else elijah has
[50:49] no help anybody with me
[50:56] so he just cut about animal and now the
[50:58] bible says
[50:59] and and he made a trench about the altar
[51:02] in other words he dig a hole you know
[51:03] what has his
[51:04] to dig a trench
[51:08] no slow down when last you dig a trench
[51:11] i remember being a young boy helping
[51:13] build a church
[51:14] fighting up trying to dig ending i
[51:16] thinking how
[51:17] this man elijah was able to physically
[51:20] build do all this
[51:25] a body altar as great as what contained
[51:28] two measures of seed
[51:29] so the bible says it wasn't a small
[51:31] trench
[51:34] he put effort into it and he put
[51:37] verse 33 he put the word in order i like
[51:40] that in order
[51:42] you would in order is your prayer life
[51:44] in order
[51:45] is your bible study in order is your
[51:47] home in order
[51:49] is your work in order are your
[51:51] conversations in order
[51:52] is your behavior in order is your
[51:55] sacrifice in order
[51:57] are you living in order is there order
[51:59] in your life
[52:00] the christian walk is a walk of order it
[52:03] was because
[52:04] there was no order god said let there be
[52:06] light to start to bring order
[52:08] out of chaos the foundation of scripture
[52:11] is bringing order
[52:12] out of chaos if your life is in chaos
[52:14] you need to get older
[52:15] all right so he put the wood in order
[52:18] and
[52:19] cut the bullock in pieces and laid him
[52:21] under wood
[52:22] and said fill four barrels with water
[52:25] and
[52:25] pour it on the burn sacrifice and on the
[52:28] wood
[52:29] so he poured water on it that's the
[52:30] first time verse 34
[52:32] and he said do it the second time and
[52:34] they did it the second time
[52:36] and he said do it the third time and
[52:38] they did it the third time
[52:40] in other words what is elijah doing
[52:42] elijah wants to make sure
[52:44] a hundred percent sure that the people
[52:46] realize that the odds are against this
[52:48] thing lighten
[52:51] he want to make sure that no matches if
[52:54] you put that matches the material out he
[52:56] said put water
[52:57] put more water this in other words the
[52:59] people must say
[53:00] listen boy i want you to see the
[53:02] conversation because people know
[53:04] under expectation elijah said lady
[53:06] gauran answered by fire you imagine
[53:08] people turn to one another but you see
[53:09] much water you put there there's no way
[53:11] that thing will light you know
[53:12] she put more water yes we why we here
[53:16] now boy because this thing can never
[53:17] light
[53:19] third water well that is it we're done
[53:21] let me just go yes because this whole
[53:23] time
[53:23] that whole team doesn't feel already 415
[53:26] at them they're just tired
[53:27] no i just want to put water put water i
[53:29] put i was fighting for him because the
[53:31] other ones feel
[53:33] that that's the reality and if it was
[53:34] god help us it was true
[53:36] any trinidad didn't make it
[53:42] and the water listen ran round about the
[53:44] altar
[53:45] and he filled the trench also with water
[53:48] so not just the
[53:49] the thing soaking now the trenching all
[53:51] through the water in other words
[53:52] the the perspective here is there's so
[53:54] much water that fire can't survive
[54:00] and it came to pass at the time of the
[54:03] offering
[54:03] of the evening sacrifice in other words
[54:08] here he was timing it
[54:11] everything is in order the bullock is in
[54:14] order the altar is restored
[54:16] the odds are against us and he's waiting
[54:18] he is counting down he's counting now
[54:19] he's counting down
[54:21] and it came to pass at the time in other
[54:23] words when the time for the evening
[54:25] sacrifice supposed to be what
[54:26] that is when he now stepping into his
[54:28] position
[54:29] you see god has got that timing all
[54:32] right
[54:33] what's your time what you see in what's
[54:34] the hour i hope you're being blessed
[54:36] tonight
[54:36] and you're getting some inspiration from
[54:38] the word tonight and it came to pass at
[54:40] the time
[54:41] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[54:43] that elijah
[54:44] the prophet you see the emphasis here we
[54:47] know we're talking realizing about even
[54:48] the scriptures
[54:49] elijah the prophet don't i don't make no
[54:51] mistake about who we talking about here
[54:53] elijah the prophet
[54:54] came near and said and this here now is
[54:57] the is the prayer of elijah i want to
[54:59] understand the prayer and i want to see
[55:01] the burden and what came out of it right
[55:05] came and said lord god of abraham you go
[55:08] back to the foundation
[55:09] isaac and of israel let it be known this
[55:13] day
[55:13] that thou art god in israel and that i
[55:16] am thy servant and that i have done all
[55:19] these things and i would
[55:21] so that first state member to clarence
[55:23] is him confirming
[55:25] that every action that has been taken up
[55:27] to this moment
[55:28] is the script i introduced it by saying
[55:30] he's reading from a playbook he's
[55:32] reading from a script
[55:33] he didn't decide what this journey was
[55:35] going to play out every single thing
[55:37] he's working on the instructions
[55:40] now this is where
[55:43] it gets interesting for us friends
[55:46] because
[55:47] every single man woman child of god
[55:50] has a right to ask
[55:54] you could ask god for things you can
[55:56] plead with god for things
[55:58] there are times god will tell you
[56:00] certain things and there are times that
[56:02] the desires of your heart if i ask any
[56:04] father in this room what are the desires
[56:06] for your children
[56:07] you will want the best for your children
[56:10] and if you go and pray
[56:11] you will pray that god give them the
[56:12] best you will pray
[56:14] for whatever is important to you you
[56:17] will pray
[56:18] for what you see as the important thing
[56:21] to pray for
[56:22] so i want to make a distinction in
[56:24] elijah's prayer at this junction
[56:26] because elijah said everything i've done
[56:28] thus far
[56:30] is according to the word but i want to
[56:32] switch over now to i want to call it the
[56:34] desire of elijah's heart
[56:37] in other words now we're entering into
[56:40] who
[56:40] elijah is as a man what he wants to see
[56:43] all right
[56:44] he said i've done these things as i
[56:47] would
[56:47] listen to his words in verse 37 very
[56:50] important
[56:51] hear me oh lord hear me that this
[56:55] that that this people may know
[56:58] no i want to slow down again hear me o
[57:01] lord hear me
[57:02] that is him that is a plea that's a cry
[57:05] he is when when he's repeating the words
[57:08] he is
[57:08] he is i want you to see him reaching out
[57:11] hear me oh lord hear me
[57:13] all right in other words lord i waited i
[57:15] wanted to pass by here in this situation
[57:18] i want to get your attention on this
[57:19] matter here that this people listen
[57:22] listen to his prayer
[57:23] may know that dog at the lord god and
[57:25] listen to the prayer
[57:27] and that though has turned their heart
[57:30] back again
[57:33] and i've read this so many times and but
[57:35] albert picked it up as well
[57:37] the desire of elijah was to have the
[57:41] people's heart turned back
[57:44] and this here is the desire that comes
[57:47] within the spirit of elijah
[57:50] and we would have spoken about the
[57:51] spirit of elijah because coming to the
[57:54] end of this whole journey
[57:55] we will see again where god told elijah
[57:58] to anoint
[57:59] elisha and to anoint jehu and we would
[58:02] see
[58:02] in our study of jehu that although god
[58:05] told elijah
[58:07] he was really speaking as it was in the
[58:08] spirit of elijah because
[58:10] elijah was not the one to anoint jehu
[58:13] the instruction to elijah went through
[58:16] elijah
[58:17] even through a son of the prophet to
[58:19] unknowing jehu
[58:21] so i want to type now that this desire
[58:26] that elijah had at this point to turn
[58:29] back doesn't it sound like when we read
[58:30] malachi 4
[58:33] because this is elijah's desire but then
[58:36] we see god in malacca i say
[58:37] behold i will send you elijah to turn
[58:41] the hearts back
[58:42] anybody with me tonight
[58:45] so elijah is connecting to the
[58:48] the magnitude of the great ministry of
[58:50] elijah
[58:52] he doesn't know how everything will play
[58:54] oh he doesn't know everything but he
[58:56] knows
[58:56] that hearts have to be turned back come
[58:59] on now
[58:59] he knows there has to be a
[59:00] reconciliation with god he knows that
[59:03] people aren't where they're supposed to
[59:04] be
[59:05] and his ministry is connected to people
[59:08] getting back together with god
[59:11] we don't know if he would understand
[59:12] what would unfold in years to come
[59:14] and that they'll be elijah in our day
[59:16] whose whole ministry will be about
[59:18] turning the hearts back
[59:19] oh anybody with me tonight but he has a
[59:23] noble desire
[59:24] he has a noble prayer let us read this
[59:27] here
[59:28] then the fire of the lord fell and
[59:30] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[59:32] and the wood and the stones
[59:36] and the dust and licked up the water
[59:39] that was in the trench
[59:40] what level of fire does it take
[59:42] hallelujah
[59:43] to burn the sacrifice and burn the wood
[59:46] and burn stones you ever see stones burn
[59:49] anybody with me
[59:50] we threw anything down you ever see a
[59:52] stone basically this stone actually
[59:54] burnt
[59:54] that's the level of fire talking about
[59:56] and the dust
[59:57] and licked up the water that was in the
[59:59] trench in other words there was no
[1:00:01] question
[1:00:02] there's no question that that is
[1:00:04] supernatural because natural
[1:00:06] could not have done this anybody with me
[1:00:10] and when all the people saw it
[1:00:13] they fell on their faces which is
[1:00:16] prostrate
[1:00:16] and they said the lord he is the god the
[1:00:19] lord
[1:00:20] he is the god and elijah
[1:00:24] said unto them take the prophets of baal
[1:00:28] let not one of them escape and they took
[1:00:31] them
[1:00:32] and elijah listen again brought them
[1:00:35] down to the broketion
[1:00:36] and sued them there i've done a lot
[1:00:40] i've done research on this thing there's
[1:00:42] nothing to suggest that elijah had help
[1:00:46] this is a monumental monumental physical
[1:00:50] feat to cut up a bullock
[1:00:53] dig a trench ladies holding out and
[1:00:56] elijah
[1:00:58] now in the spirit here killed one
[1:01:02] he had killed two he had killed three
[1:01:05] he said bring all
[1:01:10] so i don't know after 100 by thompson
[1:01:13] elijah more tired after he killed 200 i
[1:01:16] don't have anybody ever
[1:01:17] step up to help him but elijah is is
[1:01:20] clean in house as it were
[1:01:24] we're getting into what i really want to
[1:01:25] get into and may the lord bless this
[1:01:27] part of it here
[1:01:29] but abraham would have called this a
[1:01:31] great
[1:01:34] victory or to quote this exact word he
[1:01:36] used he said it was a red letter d
[1:01:39] for the prophet a red letter d
[1:01:43] and brother branham said he was tired
[1:01:45] and i wanted to see how
[1:01:48] how uh how this this this gonna and
[1:01:51] elijah
[1:01:53] verse 41 i wanted to pick up these
[1:01:55] certain things here
[1:01:56] and elijah said unto ahab get thee up
[1:02:00] eat and drink for there's a sound of the
[1:02:03] abundance of rain
[1:02:08] no i don't know how you feel
[1:02:12] but if my belief system has just crushed
[1:02:17] the bail i was worshiping the bill i led
[1:02:20] my people to follow
[1:02:22] because of my bad decision with my wife
[1:02:25] the whole system just crumbled
[1:02:27] all my priests dead and elijah
[1:02:30] says to ahab get up and eat
[1:02:35] if your world crumble you just have an
[1:02:37] appetite
[1:02:42] this is like your whole the religious
[1:02:44] side because in that day
[1:02:46] church and state was the same
[1:02:50] the kingdom and the priesthood and
[1:02:51] everything was wrapped together so if it
[1:02:53] is
[1:02:54] all my if i'm the king and i sit hungry
[1:02:57] and see all my priests there all the
[1:02:58] people who follow me asking
[1:03:00] see that the god that we abandon his
[1:03:02] real god
[1:03:03] and i am sitting and the prophet tell me
[1:03:05] go and eat
[1:03:06] if it was me b person i say well what's
[1:03:09] that really
[1:03:10] high eat right now you know my i believe
[1:03:12] you're generator really go and
[1:03:14] really process i still have to process
[1:03:16] what is happening because this year was
[1:03:17] huge
[1:03:18] like this is massive verse 42 and ahab
[1:03:21] went up to eat
[1:03:22] and drink
[1:03:25] you always know when something bothering
[1:03:27] you most people when something bothering
[1:03:29] you you lose appetite
[1:03:31] it's a human response if something goes
[1:03:34] wrong you say yeah eat nobody boy about
[1:03:36] something i stress it over something
[1:03:37] some people they have an appointment
[1:03:39] some people have job interview to go to
[1:03:40] and they don't want to eat
[1:03:41] because they're not nervous
[1:03:44] what this tells us right here is ahab
[1:03:48] was not moved by that whole thing
[1:03:52] normal normal no no
[1:03:56] lord able to see this thing that there
[1:03:59] was a test that abby self feel
[1:04:02] because if i was ahab my instinct would
[1:04:05] be
[1:04:05] well let me go and pray yes because i
[1:04:07] don't know if the for
[1:04:08] all them priests get killed i wonder if
[1:04:11] you like to
[1:04:11] kill me next boy let me go and at least
[1:04:13] pray for and repent
[1:04:14] because i don't know if elijah operating
[1:04:17] if god tell them kill a mix so elijah i
[1:04:21] appreciate the invitation to eater but
[1:04:23] let me go
[1:04:24] and pray and repent so i want you to see
[1:04:27] this small thing in scripture
[1:04:29] so ahab went up to eat and to drink
[1:04:32] and elijah look what elijah do
[1:04:35] elijah went up to the top of camel and
[1:04:37] he cast
[1:04:38] himself down upon the earth and put his
[1:04:40] face between his knees
[1:04:43] elijah is doing what ahab should have
[1:04:45] been doing
[1:04:50] this and elijah is still in a state he
[1:04:54] is seeing the spiritual side of this
[1:04:55] thing
[1:04:57] anybody with me
[1:05:02] i hope this kind of resonates with you
[1:05:04] verse 43
[1:05:05] and he said to his servants go up now
[1:05:08] with seven
[1:05:09] look toward the sea and he went up and
[1:05:11] looked and said there is nothing
[1:05:13] and he said go again seven times
[1:05:18] powerful sometimes you look for
[1:05:21] something
[1:05:22] you see go and look again right now
[1:05:24] we're looking at this scripture again we
[1:05:25] have preached this many ways
[1:05:26] many times but i'm sure somebody i'm
[1:05:29] trust is seeing something in this they
[1:05:31] never saw before
[1:05:32] but it's because we are looking again
[1:05:34] and we look at it again and again and
[1:05:35] again
[1:05:36] until this is so real to us that we will
[1:05:39] not find ourselves doing things we
[1:05:40] should not be doing anymore
[1:05:41] because we understand what this whole
[1:05:44] means how it is all connected
[1:05:45] how god operates anybody with me verse
[1:05:48] 44
[1:05:50] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:05:55] that he said behold they arise it a
[1:05:57] little cloud
[1:05:58] out of the sea like a man's hand that's
[1:06:00] why we sing a song i see i call it like
[1:06:02] a manson right
[1:06:03] and he said go up say unto ahab prepare
[1:06:06] thy chariot
[1:06:07] and get thee down that the rain stopped
[1:06:10] thee not
[1:06:11] verse 45 and it came to pass in the
[1:06:14] meanwhile that the heaven was black with
[1:06:16] clouds
[1:06:17] and wind and there was a great rain and
[1:06:20] ahab rode and went to jezreel you
[1:06:23] remember in our study of
[1:06:24] of of of of jehu jezreel was here all
[1:06:27] the action took place right
[1:06:29] listen to verse 46. elijah hasn't eaten
[1:06:34] elijah is exhausted he cut down the
[1:06:37] bullock
[1:06:38] he dig the trench he killed all the
[1:06:41] pre-sequel
[1:06:42] listen to verse 46 and the hand
[1:06:45] of the lord was on elijah
[1:06:49] and he girded up his loins and ran
[1:06:53] before ahab to the entrance of jezreel
[1:06:58] so i want you to see ahab is riding a
[1:07:01] chariot
[1:07:02] racing the jezreel and the hand of the
[1:07:05] lord
[1:07:05] i don't know how many young people have
[1:07:07] seen this before the hand of the lord
[1:07:09] came on
[1:07:10] elijah and he got to jezreel
[1:07:13] this is not translation like philip
[1:07:17] you know philip was translated in the
[1:07:18] ethiopian eunuch
[1:07:20] this is not translation this is making
[1:07:22] bolt
[1:07:23] look like he was walking
[1:07:27] because elijah tired hungry elijah
[1:07:31] with the anointing upon him i i want to
[1:07:33] see the horse in his face
[1:07:36] when they realized that was elijah just
[1:07:38] passed them
[1:07:40] because he is diversity and iran he ran
[1:07:45] so if you ever want to know the fastest
[1:07:47] race ever run
[1:07:48] in the world this is it right here
[1:07:50] because elijah outrun
[1:07:52] ahab's chariots and got to the the
[1:07:56] the entrance of jezreel before he have
[1:07:58] got there verse 19. can we take some
[1:08:00] more
[1:08:01] where is where is m m mccoy
[1:08:04] and we this thing is so richer but a
[1:08:07] clock this thing's so rich
[1:08:08] that we could go all night on this
[1:08:10] singer
[1:08:14] verse 19 let's read verse 19
[1:08:17] and ahab told jezebel all
[1:08:20] that the lord had done to show them
[1:08:24] that he was god is that what you what
[1:08:26] what what do you see in there
[1:08:29] and ahab told jezebel about the miracle
[1:08:33] that took place at camel
[1:08:36] sorry sir verse 19 verse one and ahab
[1:08:39] told jezebel that fire from god
[1:08:43] came down
[1:08:48] this is the painful part of it
[1:08:51] because and you see ahab gone home
[1:08:54] and here talking about god here talking
[1:08:57] about fire
[1:08:58] here as far as he concerned the man who
[1:09:01] trouble it israel
[1:09:02] still causing problems you see how
[1:09:06] people can see signs whatever branham
[1:09:08] and preaching this say no matter how
[1:09:09] much miracle it take place no matter
[1:09:11] what preaching you take this there are
[1:09:12] people who will never see this thing
[1:09:15] anybody with me no matter how much of
[1:09:18] this thing comes alive
[1:09:19] and signs and wonders there people will
[1:09:21] never believe this thing
[1:09:23] and look at ahab ahab went home told
[1:09:26] jezebel
[1:09:26] all that elijah had done in other words
[1:09:29] he elijah's to blame
[1:09:31] and with all how he had slain holy
[1:09:34] prophet with his sword
[1:09:35] so here the testimony like there are
[1:09:38] people get talked on the phone
[1:09:39] and sometimes you'll compare stories and
[1:09:41] when he hear his story
[1:09:43] and i say them two people was in a
[1:09:44] meeting because i get two different
[1:09:46] stories
[1:09:49] ahab version of the story is elijah gave
[1:09:54] trouble
[1:09:54] and killed the priest that's what he
[1:09:57] tell you away from
[1:10:04] verse two then jezebel sent a messenger
[1:10:07] unto elijah
[1:10:10] now and this and i wanted to catch us
[1:10:12] now because
[1:10:14] if there was ever a display of the
[1:10:15] miraculous this was it
[1:10:18] camel was a miraculous display you can't
[1:10:19] question it
[1:10:21] everything was done in such a way that
[1:10:22] there's no question but look in the face
[1:10:24] and i want you to see this
[1:10:25] in the face of manifestation there will
[1:10:27] still be people who do not believe
[1:10:30] because look at ahab who he's not a
[1:10:33] hedon
[1:10:34] he marry one but he don't believe and
[1:10:36] jezebel clearly doesn't believe
[1:10:38] then jezebel sent a message unto elijah
[1:10:41] saying so let the gods do to me in other
[1:10:44] words my gods
[1:10:46] do to me and more also if
[1:10:49] i make not thy life as the life of one
[1:10:52] of them
[1:10:53] by tomorrow about this time in other
[1:10:55] words jezebel will say
[1:10:56] let my god punish me worse than the
[1:10:59] punishment elijah do
[1:11:00] if by tomorrow this time elijah are
[1:11:02] looking dead like them guys
[1:11:06] you see this spirit here you see what
[1:11:08] we're dealing with here
[1:11:10] yeah yeah yeah yeah and listen and when
[1:11:13] he saw that this is elijah
[1:11:15] that he arose and went for his life
[1:11:18] and came to beersheba which belonged to
[1:11:21] judah
[1:11:22] and left his servant there but he
[1:11:25] himself
[1:11:26] went a day's journey verse 4 into the
[1:11:28] wilderness and came and sat down under a
[1:11:30] juniper tree
[1:11:32] and he requested for himself that he
[1:11:35] might die
[1:11:38] and said it is enough now oh lord
[1:11:42] take away my life for i am not better
[1:11:45] than my father's and that's why i call
[1:11:48] this teaching tonight
[1:11:49] when you feel like giving up and but i
[1:11:54] brought him in preaching about this said
[1:11:56] he came from a great victory
[1:11:59] and it is not just about
[1:12:02] being tired after a victory or but even
[1:12:05] i'm talking about
[1:12:05] preachers after preaching it they have a
[1:12:08] rough
[1:12:09] time after preaching and while we
[1:12:11] understand all of that there's a deeper
[1:12:13] message in here because
[1:12:17] elijah a man who
[1:12:20] speaks for god heard from god
[1:12:25] has reached a point of such sadness
[1:12:29] such depression such frustration
[1:12:32] and it has gone beyond beyond feeling
[1:12:35] just sad
[1:12:38] it has almost reached a point of
[1:12:40] irrationality
[1:12:42] how can you say that buddhism because
[1:12:45] you don't run for your life
[1:12:47] he is running from jezebel to save his
[1:12:49] life then tell him god take it
[1:12:52] it's easy i want to die i want to live
[1:12:53] but them two things cannot exist
[1:12:55] simultaneously
[1:12:57] because if you wanted to die just go
[1:12:58] straight to jezebel
[1:13:01] but he runs from jezebel to save his
[1:13:03] life then they'll tell god take it
[1:13:07] in normal term guys there's something
[1:13:10] here clicking
[1:13:12] but i want us to understand that when we
[1:13:15] go through
[1:13:18] situations when
[1:13:22] you reach a point where you feel like
[1:13:23] giving up
[1:13:25] logic doesn't work it is important for
[1:13:29] us
[1:13:30] to understand how situations could
[1:13:32] spiral
[1:13:35] the reason that elijah
[1:13:38] got from low to lower to lower it
[1:13:41] started with fear
[1:13:43] fear drove him to save his life but when
[1:13:46] he slowed down
[1:13:47] and processed it it moved from fear to
[1:13:49] another set of emotions
[1:13:51] that end up being depression
[1:13:55] and brother branham said that elijah
[1:13:57] almost had a nervous breakdown
[1:14:01] let me bring brother branham into this
[1:14:03] now
[1:14:07] but ivan said his nerves were all on the
[1:14:09] edge
[1:14:11] just like the people today we need a
[1:14:14] juniper
[1:14:15] tree he said i preach to tired people
[1:14:19] nervous people pray for nervous people
[1:14:21] it's a nervous
[1:14:23] neurotic upset world right now that
[1:14:25] we're living in
[1:14:26] everybody's just on the edge
[1:14:30] just any little thing so upsets them
[1:14:34] but if adam says god's people is that
[1:14:36] way the world is that way
[1:14:37] we all need a juniper tree a place to
[1:14:40] rest
[1:14:42] the insane institutions are filling up
[1:14:43] the hospitals are filling up
[1:14:45] and juvenile crime is on the rampage and
[1:14:47] we're living in a terrible time
[1:14:50] and men are trying to drink it away with
[1:14:52] whiskey or trying to
[1:14:53] play it off with cards or laugh it off
[1:14:55] with a joke
[1:14:57] i want to bring to us tonight friends
[1:14:59] that elijah was in pain
[1:15:02] elijah had went from victory to such
[1:15:05] disappointment
[1:15:09] and when you read further i don't know
[1:15:10] if i'll have time to get into all of it
[1:15:12] tonight he was
[1:15:13] he felt disappointed in himself
[1:15:16] he felt disappointed because he thought
[1:15:18] he did everything he could do
[1:15:21] to get people back to god
[1:15:31] but abraham said i want to quote him
[1:15:33] what upset him more than anything
[1:15:37] is that jezebel and her crowd had
[1:15:39] ignored the miracles
[1:15:43] i wanted to catch this
[1:15:46] so i want to go back we have a
[1:15:48] conversation i want to go back to
[1:15:49] elijah's prayer because elijah was
[1:15:51] praying for their hearts to be turned
[1:15:53] back
[1:15:55] and elijah had an expectation
[1:15:58] that the people would have responded to
[1:16:01] this
[1:16:02] he also had an expectation that god
[1:16:05] would make it happen
[1:16:06] i want to catch this in other words
[1:16:08] elijah
[1:16:09] when carmel is going on and the fire
[1:16:12] fell
[1:16:12] elijah felt like it is finished
[1:16:16] these people cannot go back to their own
[1:16:18] way
[1:16:19] can't go back to how they were before
[1:16:21] because this
[1:16:22] is what it would take to push them back
[1:16:25] online or turn their hearts back
[1:16:28] so fear is what begin to move elijah
[1:16:31] but the depression and the anguish and
[1:16:34] the unmet
[1:16:35] expectations he had of the people
[1:16:37] changing
[1:16:39] was just too much for him that's why he
[1:16:41] would say
[1:16:42] it is enough in other words at the end
[1:16:44] of my road i don't know what to do now
[1:16:46] i try i'm tired i'm tired i'm tired
[1:16:50] i'm exhausted and when the branham is
[1:16:54] preaching you say
[1:16:55] we all get that point when we get tired
[1:16:59] we feel we have tried everything we have
[1:17:02] done our best
[1:17:04] we have done the best parenting we know
[1:17:06] how we have made the best effort we know
[1:17:08] how and
[1:17:08] and somehow as it were we look at the
[1:17:10] fruits of it and it seems
[1:17:12] it seems as if
[1:17:15] this thing makes no sense
[1:17:19] and i look at the parallel with our
[1:17:20] elijah because he also tries to take his
[1:17:23] own life
[1:17:28] and we have to be careful as believers
[1:17:30] to understand how to
[1:17:31] manage expectations one and two
[1:17:34] understand the
[1:17:35] principle of god's timing
[1:17:38] because elijah's desire was to see the
[1:17:41] hearts turn back
[1:17:43] and we we us you me we are living in a
[1:17:46] day
[1:17:47] of the hearts being turned back
[1:17:50] because what was a desire for him is a
[1:17:52] command for our day
[1:17:55] it's a commission for our day behold i
[1:17:57] singular personal pronoun behold i
[1:17:59] will send you elijah to turn back that's
[1:18:02] his mission
[1:18:03] that's his objective that's his purpose
[1:18:05] that's his mandate
[1:18:06] that is his orders anybody with me
[1:18:10] tonight
[1:18:17] i trust this is being a blessing to you
[1:18:22] let's go on
[1:18:25] and as he lay and slept
[1:18:29] under juniper tree that's where it comes
[1:18:33] from
[1:18:33] behold then an angel touched him and
[1:18:36] said unto him
[1:18:37] arise and eat and he looked
[1:18:40] and behold there was a cake bacon on the
[1:18:43] coals
[1:18:44] on a cruise of water at his head and he
[1:18:46] did eat and drink
[1:18:47] and laid him down again
[1:18:53] and the age of the lord came again the
[1:18:55] second time and touched him and said
[1:18:57] arise and eat
[1:18:59] because the journey is too great for
[1:19:01] thee
[1:19:03] and friends remember the brand i'm
[1:19:05] speaking about this juniper tree one
[1:19:06] thing i love about this
[1:19:09] i was wondering what to title this
[1:19:11] tonight
[1:19:13] i was going between when you feel like
[1:19:16] giving up
[1:19:17] and i was gonna say maybe when last you
[1:19:21] took a rest
[1:19:24] because this lesson of the juniper tree
[1:19:26] is about
[1:19:27] taking a rest but a branham said that
[1:19:32] people think prophets and preachers
[1:19:34] could just keep going go and go and go
[1:19:36] in
[1:19:37] and it's not just about prophets and
[1:19:38] teachers it's about taking
[1:19:41] a rest and you see
[1:19:44] and just say arise and eat
[1:19:48] but ibrahim even talk about exercise and
[1:19:52] eating
[1:19:52] and get catching back your balance
[1:19:55] especially now more than ever
[1:20:00] and it says here you have to eat you
[1:20:02] have to rest
[1:20:04] because the journey is too great for
[1:20:05] thee in other words to take this journey
[1:20:08] you need something more you need to eat
[1:20:09] and rest
[1:20:10] but the branham says here in what here
[1:20:13] is that elijah oh how that we need in
[1:20:15] this journey that we in now to find a
[1:20:17] place of rest and that's what i see
[1:20:21] these bible studies are
[1:20:22] it's a place of rest it's to recalibrate
[1:20:25] it's the pause it's a sailor
[1:20:27] it's peace peace and a storm
[1:20:33] rest eat angel cakes may this word come
[1:20:36] to us tonight as angel cakes
[1:20:39] food for your soul food for your mind
[1:20:42] food for your spirit
[1:20:44] because when you're tired you don't make
[1:20:46] good decisions
[1:20:49] when you're tired you make illogical
[1:20:52] when you're stressed out you cannot make
[1:20:53] good decisions
[1:20:56] and the journey ahead of you has
[1:20:58] decisions that must be made
[1:21:03] some of us we just need to pause
[1:21:08] that's why by the way i'm saying we all
[1:21:09] need a juniper tree
[1:21:12] lord help us tonight i don't know if
[1:21:13] this is helping anybody tonight
[1:21:16] we all need a juniper tree
[1:21:23] but imam said what we need is a juniper
[1:21:25] tree a place we can we can get quiet
[1:21:27] before god
[1:21:30] but abandonment are reading a guinness
[1:21:32] quote how that we need in this journey
[1:21:33] that we're in now to find a place of
[1:21:35] rest
[1:21:36] and to feast on the word of god so that
[1:21:38] it will give us strength
[1:21:41] night after night go to the room and
[1:21:42] rest and come back the next morning
[1:21:45] fresh
[1:21:46] and eat more for there's a great journey
[1:21:48] and a great battle ahead for the church
[1:21:51] i believe that we have been children
[1:21:53] long enough god's going to turn his
[1:21:54] church into manhood now
[1:21:56] meaning there are greater
[1:21:57] responsibilities ahead you can't give up
[1:21:59] now you can
[1:22:00] god is is is and and i love this because
[1:22:04] it's a lesson god yes i say why are you
[1:22:06] doing there
[1:22:07] get up no god say listen listen all
[1:22:09] right all right all right
[1:22:10] you're feeling overwhelmed rest because
[1:22:14] i have a journey that greater than if
[1:22:16] you think what you went through is tough
[1:22:18] it's a there's a harder journey but
[1:22:20] before i have a conversation with you
[1:22:21] because i need to talk to you
[1:22:22] i want a secretary i want to talk to you
[1:22:24] but i can't talk to you when you're in
[1:22:26] this state
[1:22:28] right though you're all flusterated
[1:22:30] right now you're you're you're coming
[1:22:32] out of a high you're vex with the people
[1:22:33] you're vex with me
[1:22:35] you're vex with you're all over the
[1:22:36] place because of unmet
[1:22:38] expectations what how you thought it
[1:22:40] would work out didn't work out that way
[1:22:42] so you you you you just saying things
[1:22:45] it's better die
[1:22:46] you don't want to die because you're
[1:22:48] running from jezebel but here you see
[1:22:49] anyone to die make up your mind sleep
[1:22:51] relax yourself eat rest
[1:22:55] when you rest and you eat and you rest
[1:22:58] and you eat
[1:22:58] and you calm down and you relax because
[1:23:01] our junity take you because i want to
[1:23:02] have a conversation with you
[1:23:04] anybody with me tonight
[1:23:09] verse seven i want to try to find a
[1:23:10] place to close out that's trying to i'm
[1:23:12] trying to i'm trying to go as fast as i
[1:23:13] come but
[1:23:13] i can't speed up and he arose
[1:23:17] this is verse 8 and did eat and drink
[1:23:21] and went check this out in the strength
[1:23:24] of that meat
[1:23:25] 40 days and 40 nights unto hurry up the
[1:23:28] mount of god but a branham said
[1:23:30] don't these scientists wish they could
[1:23:32] figure out what
[1:23:34] elijah is he said what kind of food
[1:23:36] could a man eat
[1:23:38] that he could go for 40 days and fought
[1:23:40] a night on that food
[1:23:41] lord i want that kind of food
[1:23:45] in other words this tired man this
[1:23:48] this man who was speaking out of the
[1:23:51] character he was
[1:23:52] out of character you know you ever meet
[1:23:53] somebody and say that he's not a person
[1:23:55] no boy something had to happen to him
[1:23:56] boy
[1:23:57] he don't talk so you know he don't talk
[1:23:59] so that
[1:24:00] i don't know i'm tim now but i'm not a
[1:24:02] man i know boy that's how elijah wasn't
[1:24:04] him
[1:24:05] after a great victory you see a man of
[1:24:08] god saying i were there i wanted there
[1:24:10] god kill me god kill me i'm done i fed
[1:24:12] up i tired is enough lord
[1:24:13] that that is how the man reached
[1:24:17] because he had in his mind how things
[1:24:20] should work out
[1:24:24] and we have to trust god enough what
[1:24:27] just
[1:24:28] shows friends is that there was a
[1:24:29] misalignment
[1:24:31] in elijah's level of trust in the plan
[1:24:33] of god
[1:24:36] and his desire and that's why i say we
[1:24:38] have to be so careful because we desire
[1:24:40] things
[1:24:42] just as elijah desired things and it was
[1:24:44] not a bad desire he didn't have a wrong
[1:24:45] desire
[1:24:46] his desire was really hard to be turned
[1:24:48] back
[1:24:50] and he had an expectation that that
[1:24:53] service that day was going to change
[1:24:55] you know many times i preached and i
[1:24:57] watch young people
[1:24:58] and i pray to god let this be the day
[1:25:00] it's painful
[1:25:01] when you know what they're going through
[1:25:03] and you preach and you see something
[1:25:05] happen
[1:25:05] and you say oh god let this be the day
[1:25:07] and then you hear that and foolishness
[1:25:08] again
[1:25:10] you feel like you waste your time and i
[1:25:13] can pull any parent in a room tonight
[1:25:16] how many times you've spoken to your
[1:25:17] children how many times you've spoken to
[1:25:19] family members
[1:25:20] and you wish them the best you give them
[1:25:22] the best advice you could you pour your
[1:25:24] heart out you pour energy out and your
[1:25:26] wistings would be working and then
[1:25:27] you'll look and see them do the same
[1:25:29] nonsense again
[1:25:30] it is a frustrating position it is a
[1:25:32] hard place to be
[1:25:33] but i want to encourage you in the midst
[1:25:35] of that just pause
[1:25:36] just rest just trust god because he is
[1:25:39] in control
[1:25:41] what elijah had to understand was god is
[1:25:44] in control of his own timing
[1:25:47] god is the god of his timing and our
[1:25:50] very best expectations our very best
[1:25:53] plans our very best desires even our
[1:25:56] prayers
[1:25:56] are subject to his timing can the church
[1:25:59] say amen
[1:26:02] don't give up say the right thing
[1:26:06] don't make decisions if you're super
[1:26:09] exhausted
[1:26:10] and you're and you know you're not where
[1:26:12] it's supposed to be
[1:26:14] one of the very best advice to give
[1:26:16] parents is if you have to discipline
[1:26:17] your child
[1:26:18] don't do it at that point in time you're
[1:26:20] not thinking straight
[1:26:24] most bad decisions take place because
[1:26:26] you're having pause enough
[1:26:28] to calm down to make the right decision
[1:26:33] pause take a lesson from elijah
[1:26:38] hit the bricks get some rest eat
[1:26:40] something reevaluate this
[1:26:42] this the situation notice there was no
[1:26:46] word being communicated in this
[1:26:48] experience here god didn't tell elijah
[1:26:50] anything
[1:26:51] all he liked was doing was eating and
[1:26:53] resting eating and resting
[1:26:55] eating and resting and just eating and
[1:26:57] resting
[1:26:58] the word didn't come here the world will
[1:26:59] come later on
[1:27:02] god will give him his instructions later
[1:27:04] on but god has to and for god to talk to
[1:27:07] you
[1:27:07] some of your business has to also stop
[1:27:10] there's a lot of lessons in here
[1:27:12] you're going all over the place and
[1:27:13] you're tired you yeah you cast the
[1:27:15] opportunity
[1:27:16] your car process bible study your car
[1:27:18] pray you're just wiped out
[1:27:21] don't sleep any time for prayer no make
[1:27:23] other things stop the rest so you can
[1:27:26] come and pray
[1:27:28] whatever tonight can we try to wrap this
[1:27:31] up
[1:27:32] let me go a little bit again verse nine
[1:27:36] i wanna try to bring this uh close and
[1:27:38] he came to the under a cave
[1:27:40] so under the strength of that food he
[1:27:42] was able to go for 40 days
[1:27:44] until horeb the mount of god and he came

[1:28:31] you're opening amenable to conversation
[1:28:33] i've been waiting to catch your
[1:28:34] attention all the time
[1:28:35] he was caught up in in you and how you
[1:28:37] feel and your emotions and what you

[1:28:54] i have feelings about how about you lord
[1:28:56] and how people
[1:28:57] view you i'm jealous about you i find
[1:28:59] people listen
[1:29:00] for the children of israel have forsaken
[1:29:02] thy covenant
[1:29:04] this is not a bad place when i said but
[1:29:05] just he was just too caught up in it
[1:29:07] that he couldn't
[1:29:08] he couldn't even make this a coherent
[1:29:09] statement 40 days ago
[1:29:12] for each one of us forsaken thy covenant
[1:29:14] thrown down thine altars
[1:29:16] and slain thy prophets with the sword
[1:29:18] and i even i only am left
[1:29:21] and they seek my life to take it away
[1:29:26] all elijah airport here is after mount
[1:29:28] carmel they're still looking for me too
[1:29:32] and listen and he said go forth and
[1:29:34] stand upon the mount before the lord
[1:29:36] and behold the lord pass by powerful
[1:29:39] here friends
[1:29:40] and a great and strong wind rent the
[1:29:42] mountains
[1:29:43] and break in pieces the rocks before the
[1:29:46] lord
[1:29:46] but the lord was not in the wind friends
[1:29:50] you know what
[1:29:50] level of wind it takes to break a rock
[1:29:56] if you have seen hurricanes when you
[1:29:58] talk about a category 5 hurricane
[1:30:01] it speaks a certain character of speed
[1:30:03] of the wind that will uproot a tree you
[1:30:06] know what level wind it takes to break a
[1:30:07] rock
[1:30:11] but i'm tired and said listen this is
[1:30:13] the displays it could be a big revival a
[1:30:15] great move
[1:30:16] all kinds of different things that i
[1:30:17] need and and what brother branham was
[1:30:19] teaching and what god is showing here
[1:30:21] is that god sometimes doesn't want to be
[1:30:24] in the
[1:30:24] visible the grand the great display
[1:30:27] things so he said
[1:30:28] say yes god could do that but he was not
[1:30:30] in that
[1:30:32] anybody with me but the lord was not in
[1:30:35] the wind and after the women and
[1:30:36] earthquake
[1:30:37] god could do that too but the lord was
[1:30:39] not in the earthquake
[1:30:41] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[1:30:43] lord was not in the fire
[1:30:44] but after the fire are still small voice
[1:30:49] may you hear the still small voice i'm
[1:30:51] getting ready to close out just bear
[1:30:52] with me a few more minutes
[1:30:55] still small voice and it was so but
[1:30:57] about him said this was elijah
[1:30:59] and i and it's interesting to have with
[1:31:01] a brand i'm talking about elijah
[1:31:03] hallelujah talk about elijah was one of
[1:31:05] them eagles
[1:31:07] so he knew what to listen for and so
[1:31:10] when elijah heard it
[1:31:12] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[1:31:14] went out and stood in the
[1:31:15] entering in of the cave so whatever i'm
[1:31:19] saying and typing this out
[1:31:20] it was camel juniper tree
[1:31:23] cave and behold there came a voice unto
[1:31:26] him and said
[1:31:27] what does thou hear elijah
[1:31:30] and he said i've been very jealous for
[1:31:33] the lord god of hosts
[1:31:36] are you jealous for the lord god of us
[1:31:38] this is the same thing
[1:31:40] like in ezekiel those who sigh and cry
[1:31:42] for the abomination
[1:31:44] the pain of seeing israel in a
[1:31:47] backslidden condition was eaten
[1:31:49] elijah up
[1:31:53] have you lost your sensitivity to the
[1:31:55] spiritual realm
[1:31:56] that you just accept
[1:32:00] any living as the new normal we threw
[1:32:03] along this phrase new normal all the
[1:32:04] time
[1:32:06] but has been a casual christian become
[1:32:08] your new normal
[1:32:10] has no prayer life become your new
[1:32:13] normal
[1:32:14] has no sincerity become your new normal
[1:32:18] no burden for the young people is that
[1:32:20] your new normal
[1:32:22] yes your child given trouble but let it
[1:32:24] not be the new normal
[1:32:25] that you don't lift them up before god
[1:32:28] and say lord i'm jealous
[1:32:29] for the lord god of hosts because the
[1:32:31] children of israel have forsaken
[1:32:33] thy covenant thrown down nine altars and
[1:32:35] slain thy prophets with us all
[1:32:37] and i even i only am left and they seek
[1:32:40] my life to take it away
[1:32:43] and we read this scripture when i was
[1:32:45] teaching on jehu
[1:32:47] and the lord said unto him go return on
[1:32:49] thy way
[1:32:50] to the wilderness of damascus in other
[1:32:52] words
[1:32:53] this is your mission i've given you the
[1:32:55] continuation of your ministry
[1:32:57] all right i understand your burden i
[1:32:59] knew you were upset
[1:33:00] you're calm now now you relate to me
[1:33:03] what your concerns are

[1:33:07] about it
[1:33:08] and how you are part of that program
[1:33:10] anybody with me tonight hallelujah
[1:33:13] and the lord said unto him go in other
[1:33:15] words
[1:33:16] all of this talk time time for talk done
[1:33:19] time to move
[1:33:19] go return on thy way to the wilderness
[1:33:23] of damascus
[1:33:24] and when thou coments anoint israel to
[1:33:26] be king over syria
[1:33:28] and jehu who we talked about the son of
[1:33:31] nimshi
[1:33:31] shadow anoint to be king over israel
[1:33:34] and elisa the son of shafat of abel
[1:33:38] meloha
[1:33:38] shall do anoint to be prophet in thy
[1:33:41] room
[1:33:41] and it shall come to pass that him that
[1:33:43] escaped the sword of israel
[1:33:45] shall jehu sleep and him that escape it
[1:33:48] from the sword of jehu
[1:33:50] shall elijah sleep and in case you were
[1:33:53] thinking that you were the only one left
[1:33:55] yet i have left me seven thousand in
[1:33:58] israel
[1:33:59] oh god help me you're not alone elijah i
[1:34:01] think
[1:34:02] you you there wondering if you are the
[1:34:03] only one hanging in there
[1:34:05] yet i have a given a recount because i
[1:34:08] keep
[1:34:08] account i count the year on your head i
[1:34:10] know how much profits i have
[1:34:12] yet i have still i have despite
[1:34:15] the move of the enemy i have left me
[1:34:19] seven thousand in israel all the knees
[1:34:22] which have not bowed unto baal and every
[1:34:25] mount which had not kissed him
[1:34:28] hallelujah glory to god so glorious
[1:34:31] telling elijah
[1:34:32] you they're stressed out thinking you
[1:34:34] are the only one left
[1:34:35] a big part of his issue was he's the
[1:34:38] only one left
[1:34:39] in other words he said it's just me you
[1:34:40] know and i don't think i can do this on
[1:34:42] my own
[1:34:42] and god saying it's not just you just
[1:34:44] look to your left just look to your
[1:34:46] right you can't see them with your eyes
[1:34:48] hallelujah but they still have seven
[1:34:50] thousand who still believe
[1:34:51] that this gospel is real there's still
[1:34:53] seven thousand who still believe
[1:34:55] that the rapture will take place there's
[1:34:57] still seven thousand who still believe
[1:35:00] they are just like you hallelujah they
[1:35:02] may not know one another
[1:35:04] some may be in mar about some indigo
[1:35:05] mountain some in arima some in grandi
[1:35:08] some in shogonas they are all over the
[1:35:10] world but they have not bowed down
[1:35:12] they have not given up they still
[1:35:14] believe they might have
[1:35:15] their own mount carmel experiences they
[1:35:17] might have their own experiences that
[1:35:19] lead them to their juniper trees
[1:35:21] but be assured i still have a plan go go
[1:35:24] on anoint

[1:35:56] dealt
[1:35:56] with elijah and the juniper tree and the
[1:35:59] whole unfolding
[1:36:00] is a program god took elijah through
[1:36:03] therapy hallelujah
[1:36:04] god took elijah through through coming
[1:36:07] back to himself because he lost himself
[1:36:09] he lost himself and sometimes we do
[1:36:12] lose ourselves but if ever you lose
[1:36:14] yourself i want you to come back right
[1:36:15] here
[1:36:16] to first kings 19
[1:36:19] and say okay i need to rest i need to
[1:36:22] eat
[1:36:23] i need to wait because god have a word
[1:36:25] for me it won't be in the wind
[1:36:28] it won't be in the earthquake it won't
[1:36:30] be any fire
[1:36:31] but wait wait until it's still small
[1:36:34] voice
[1:36:34] because it'll be in the still small
[1:36:37] voice i'm going to close with these
[1:36:38] quotes from the prophet
[1:36:39] but ibrahimo said what does thou hear
[1:36:42] what do you hear
[1:36:43] all these things that's been going on
[1:36:44] what have you heard in it
[1:36:46] we've heard confusions we've heard ups
[1:36:48] and downs we have organized several
[1:36:50] different organizations we've done
[1:36:51] great things but where's god in the
[1:36:53] whole thing so but at brandon was saying
[1:36:55] even after all of that god is bringing
[1:36:58] elijah to the point
[1:36:59] to listen to listen to hear god speaking
[1:37:02] to you
[1:37:03] tonight i want you to listen because
[1:37:05] there's a message in here
[1:37:06] for you it may be different from
[1:37:08] somebody else but there's a still small
[1:37:10] voice
[1:37:10] that you need to filter filter away the
[1:37:12] wind filter away the earthquake
[1:37:14] filter away the fire and get that still
[1:37:17] small voice
[1:37:17] i just have two last quotes and we're
[1:37:19] done but abraham said
[1:37:21] we can testify and jump up and down and
[1:37:24] sing
[1:37:24] and everything like that but until god
[1:37:28] makes us in such a condition till we can
[1:37:31] recognize one another as brothers until
[1:37:34] all malice envy strife and everything's
[1:37:38] gone
[1:37:38] out of us our jumping shouting praising
[1:37:42] god
[1:37:42] organizing speaking in tongues and
[1:37:45] healing the sick
[1:37:46] and performing miracles and everything
[1:37:48] else will never amount to nothing come
[1:37:50] back
[1:37:51] listen come back and wait in the cave
[1:37:54] till we hear this still small voice that
[1:37:57] calls us the service of god
[1:37:59] oh how we need it how the world needs it
[1:38:02] we need that god will provide hallelujah
[1:38:06] last quote what we need is to wait till
[1:38:09] we hear the voice of god as individuals
[1:38:12] i want us to see friends from carmel to
[1:38:15] the juniper the recovery point
[1:38:17] god was all of this was leading elijah
[1:38:20] to the cave to that still small voice to
[1:38:22] know the next step in his journey
[1:38:24] what we need for the bran said is to
[1:38:26] wait till we hear the voice of god as
[1:38:28] individuals every man
[1:38:30] and woman in this convention but iran
[1:38:32] himself and i'll say this bible study
[1:38:34] no matter if jim jones and the rest of
[1:38:36] them that with you if they don't do it
[1:38:38] you do it anyhow
[1:38:38] you pull yourself back in a cave and
[1:38:41] wait there
[1:38:42] until god speaks to you don't you move
[1:38:45] he will do it
[1:38:46] shall we bow our heads for a word of
[1:38:47] prayer oh gracious heavenly father

[1:39:05] moment of time
[1:39:06] lord with carmel but to see how lord he
[1:39:09] would

[1:39:16] that ministry of elijah that is so
