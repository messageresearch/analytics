have really been in the battlefield over decades of the case of periods of times and there we are we have the pleasure to bring to the pulpit the man of God another person than pastor Reverend doctor but our reality [Applause] I don't know what else to say I love him so much from my heart just wait a minute I don't want to take your time but you know it's good to say something good about somebody I remember when I left colaba and then I came to a new group I was born and brought up in Legos anyway my parents home I stayed here my people still live there for those of you who know they're for coming back every holidays our Legos was my church and then I go back to school and ubu happen to be my church for you some of you young people when you go to school maybe outside of your home church nobody sees you around in any fellowship [Music] [Applause] [Music] when I would when I would come now we have more beautiful churches now in those days we don't have anything in fact is when you set in and you see the church you will believe what the people have told you they call us all kinds of name in those days and if you ever we enter such places you will just turn away and say look at how their church look like but that was not what I was looking for I was looking for the world and then I could come to a fellowship whereby I will be fed not only being fed that day as I'm going home I'll be giving one terms of assignment and that is for me to go and feed more at home those are the things that mode me they're more than me so what a ministers come here preaching to you read your Bible really summon books they are made more accessible to you health care is a difficult thing in Nigeria today because it's not made an easily accessible but the Word of God is made is they accessible to all of us so why can't we get more and more of it and give strong for the Lord and I want to let you know I can't tell it all if you're tell me to talk about the testimonies of the blessings I received under brother always ministry I believe that I would not be able to finish it till I die it is not just to over say something but is to tell you the truth and the blessings are still what is bestowed and they are still what you are saying and he's been a blessing not only to me to my family and I say is he going that and on and on and I want to say brother all would thank you for giving to the Lord [Applause] give me that song I was one of the lives that was changed thank you for giving to the Lord [Music] just close your eyes I appreciate the Lord to these ministers

find anything else left to say but anyway trust that God will help us again this morning anyway I I have a few conduct scriptures Isaiah 55 I think it's verse 7 maybe let me read that brother over the thing read that yesterday because I want to cut this subject of sowing and reaping from a little different angle alright let the wicked forsake his thoughts now let me read it from verse 6 the thing that's way brother theory from last night seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon I like the way the babble is you know resist things and is a is a rich guys and abundant God and he he has all the works and he and he means every single thing that he says he is an abundant God is a God of abundance so he will pardon there is nothing there's no sin no wrong that he can't he doesn't have the pattern for his pattern is abundant oh my verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways hear the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts that's really saying something I forgot to say that his thoughts and our thoughts on a totally different level so I got a little for this morning and a little excitation to admonish you to think different and I trust and pray and hope that by the time this convention is done and I know girls really tremendously a bit blessed us in a tremendous manner I wasn't here the first day so means for the Akers message but I suffered a chalice message online when we were coming and I think he was low here is it for you totally outstanding and then yesterday morning brother Isaac there's some that there preaches and there are approaches there are those of us who pretend to preach and they are those who real preach and brother Isaac is one of them ma and Cheri is here to reap and the yesterday afternoon the test mention on the brothers button and a sub so wonderful wonderful so good to meet you to know you but little was with you last year right and so so god bless you brother so glad to meet you and to know you and thank you for those words brother brother LAN C and brother Emil thank you so much for your words also and last night they rely on the word thank about the fear for those lovely words last night so I who are in a convention after Trina who are in brother Wes estimation in West Palm Beach and brother Theo was there myself but array thumbs in for that chance we are a tremendous John Cena was totally of the chats but the orbits Commission totally of the chats and then when who west bumping the fallen weakened and immobile Wesco many of Ross member was performing way back in the past and he have this convention he was absolutely mind-bending stuff it was totally outstanding also and brother fuel myself brother Ray were talking and said we really thoroughly enjoyed the convention I know because we're not preaching so just come for the service like you do and you go to the room you relax and you come back and you come in start getting the service when you have to preach and you see your notes being taken away from you word on top of world on top of water on top of world it's tough to enjoy the convention that way so anyway proof for me I don't have much of a message but I so pretend like you I hear any message okay I don't change you tell a lie so just pretend like you're having it you're in a message okay will you do that for me all right so the preachers are already preached all right and the preachers are coming after me to preach so both for those of us who try to make like we are preachers just pretend like you are hearing a message okay all right say preaching Jesus the Bible said when he met those two hundred emails and he was going he made like he was gonna go beyond because he's decent he won't say I'm gonna come to your house now have any meal for me you wanted them to invite him so just do like Jesus be just make like you are enjoying the message okay all right so my tattoo is a little unusual and I hope I will be able to like you know get my thoughts together my child is thinking differently thinking differently and I will chose had this inspiration are just like we came from trina and OVD you know the the harvest and it was really totally tremendous and and but the child you know grows here with sowing and reaping they were so in tears shall reap in joy and it's a bit about sowing and reaping is more important to you than you possibly will ever realize but a choice and hope that through this course of these meetings from other channels I mean brother acres message through the channels you are getting a bit of a glimpse of what it is all about showing unripened because it's a is a principle of life that affects you more than you would ever think of it's affects you more than you catch you understand or care to like you know or you might know maybe not maybe you care but you might not realize the effect is so much like that so just want to talk to you a little bit about that and how that you know all put together into you thinking differently thinking differently as a Christian as a believer as a minister whoever you are whatever your life's purpose because that's how you are going to come to perfection amen you can do this regular thing like everybody else is doing and then hope to be you know in the rapture it's not gonna walk that way the price a little different like what the channel said super rich super piranhas are a super brother super sister so we're super we're a little bit above the regular shade amen you were not like everybody else you were different from them amen and I can't say that our are strong enough for young people because there's so much attack on the message these days that you really wonder and you see the cooling off especially among the younger folks but everybody just if you can if you there but Moses said we will not leave one hoof behind so even if it's one person it's a concern to us but if you understand and know and believe the revelation of God in his word that you are different you are not like everybody else God has a special purpose special place for you in bringing you here if you really understand and believe that and shake yourself and pull yourself back the you might begin to understand like that is a privilege the hanno to be calling to this intimation of the hour Amen because this message is not for everybody this makes for a special breed a special group of people and you are that special group of people Oh glory to God amen amen let me get my but a few is not seen me so let me get my loose sheets together here with you you're not looking okay this one is you know I mean I'm struck with this one here okay let me let me let me remove my jacket can I thank you it used to be years ago I would preach I won't even put on the jacket but I grew up and became more cultured so Ryan put a jacket on I want to go in the pulpit I remove it so my jackets last a long time okay no seriously sir so don't feel sure for me oh but although he's gonna I gotta get my jacket don't don't don't spare yourself the thought my jacket feels very very new so anyway sowing and reaping and I just talked to you is the principle of life like I said that means motive I could maybe you realize because we had got seed and Jesus said the Word of God is a seed and seats as sown and planted not the words sown and planted there's a showing that they planted the two different things a little different a little different and what is soul you are going to reap Amen so this principle yeah you wanna apply it in every single area of our lives more than we ever might understand or realize because this principle comes from before the finishing of the wall comes from God's mind before the foundation of the wall and this principle is table is a standard is a principle that permits every single area of life this place will produce the creation this principle of sowing and reaping produce a perfect world a prophet earth that God created this principle of sowing and reaping produce a perfect Garden of Eden with a perfect man there is son of God on the face of the earth standing there and I'm achieve God on the face of the earth which talking about power God's or Adam and reaped a prophet man because Adam was a seed of the words and God read a man a son of God that became the flesh of the world the Word made flesh was sowing and reaping amen amen so this is a very powerful thought here it may be called it comes from God's mind this principle produced a prophet man on the face of the earth amen this boot on Adam from his seat of the world into the flesh of the world the world made flesh a perfect man stain on the face of the earth this principle here made Adam the Supreme Being the sprinkler the top of God's creation on the face of the earth and this same principle is here walking on you and I and you know turn ours amen into the capstone bride of Jesus Christ the top of God's creation in the seven church age is sowing and reaping amen if we go in Eden but the Bronco actually called Genesis the seed chapter of the Bible every seed was planned in Genesis amen and that's what that's what I prophet him to show us to let us know that every seed was then Genesis because before if you want a manifesto of anything it's gotta be planted somewhere there's gotta be a sowing frost before there is a manifestation or a reaping amen glory to God amen glory to God amen amen so sowing and reaping is an eternal truth of God amen that works in all of life it works within the church it works without the church unbelievers used the principle and it works for them Christians used the principle and it works for them the husband used the principle arranged is what you works for him wife usually works for her the businessman usually works for him the student usually works for him is the principle of life because God put it there if a Christian from a source and it was necesitas he will reap a harvest if an atheist farmer source and observe the same principles he will reap the same average is that right can I get a witness back amen amen so this principle is not for believers alone though we are focusing on the believers because that's what we are by the grace of Almighty God but I'm just going to show you this principle is the principle that comes from God and God put this principle there to work for men and walk in man and walk through and is by this principle value and I had today the people are sowing and reaping amen now Jesus said the soul went is sow the seed I have but the rail read a quote one time differentiating sowing and planting your sewing is more like topsoil it doesn't go so deep but planting goes much deeper and that's what we are America for planted and sowed the seed of the entire Bible so whether it's planted or sword it up to you you can change that and the Bible says nothing but the Oviedo somebody coulda died yesterday so break up your fallow ground so you have to see it is sword and ready break up your fallow ground for it's time to seek the Lord because as you do that then the city goes down deep down and takes root in your soul and out of your belly shall flow the Tree of Life growing again or hallelujah glory to God amen sopia decent man I was talking about the sewing gather in my name and sowing and reaping amen amen produce a harvest in Eden and Adam was the full of the harvest and this same principle will produce in this end time here a bride a bride and that's why God has a caller after the Prophet initiative saw the word to go into the prophets message and amen and check off his words that he already sold and take the same words and and speak them back to you and what are those words those seeds with tears of revelation and inspiration think people over there was so much clearly last night oh it's beautiful those beautiful bringing the seed the watering Amen for the preacher the watching by the praises outstanding so much clarity on the world support melaka for brought the world he brought the revelation and we come a minister commenting on the prophet and with tears of Revelation inspiration they have watered the seats in your soul and you take the same word and pick up your final crown of your heart and let the word go down deep because if the series tops all you are not going to last much longer you are not going to last very long if the series topsoil thus it can be the best seed if you take a good seat and put on this ground here and put some soil here on this gun here you have you have sowed the seed but for that seat to really become what it's supposed to be you need to break up this ground and let that sit go down deep but God cut the so of the preacher like who this convention shows the world Malekith already solid so we just come back to recycle it back so the word and when you what comes to you in frozen different kinds of a hearts different kind of sorrow but you how to take the words the seed and say no this is not gonna be topsoil you'll break up your fallow ground and drink up the word of the Spirit and the word goes down deep in your soul and begins to germinate because the TIC roots and you begin like solid and no man can shake here no man can talk about that word because only certain your soul is planted in your soul so I say Monica for already come and soared and planted the seed of the entire Bible and it's in your soul this morning can you say Amen amen you may be seated Susu inner reaping produce in Eden a perfect man on the face of the earth Adam with preeminence sees on the face of the other working my subject really ISM living in preeminence easy amen so serene reaping producing Adam a perfect man who was living in preeminence ease and this same principle Parisian the bright at the ends I'm here a prophet bright living in preeminence ease you're gonna find out what it means to live in preeminence is Amen before we finish shows that God will help us amen sowing and reaping you wanna hear today Justin leaving believe in God that we will be harvested like Adam was a perfect man on the face of the earth even because the seed has been playing our souls and we are respond to that seed and we are doing all we know to do to pick up a fallow ground so that sheep goes deep down and takes root in a source on our hats Oh hallelujah unlike pathological charities get a reap and Charlie will reap all of God's Saints that been planted and sewed by Malecha for and you are one of those season up in plan and super melaka for so by this principle amen so in a reaping man in every area of life achieve the purpose that desire every purpose of managership by this principle in all of life's areas inside the church outside the church you're unbelievable friends everybody because man is wired by God to live by the principles of God whether they acknowledge God or not because the one the rules and reigns in the affairs of men he created man and this Pebble watch these gospel works even when they don't acknowledge it is you what's in their lives glory to God amen oh brother amen amen so by this principle here amen sowing and reaping the Prophet Malachi 4 has come and a sword and planted the seed of the entire Bible in order that a perfect brow will come forth and by this same principle this bride is gonna be reaped have a said like Adam Wars by charity which is had a reap now amen you know repay a perfect man stand on the face of the earth in the beauty of his audience don't ever let the message become a cliche to you just words that are spoken don't let it become a cliche to you and the way to do that is gonna break up your fallow ground your shallow ground break it out let the seat go down deep you can't afford to be a so-so believer you can't afford to be a wishy-washy Christian you cannot afford to be a fellow crime believer you cannot afford to be a shallow ground believer you gotta break up your fallow ground leather watch accrues if you are the only man in your school only get on your street amen your Jutes are deep and your roots are deep and they go way back into Elohim is mind and the devil can shake here the devil can shake here you believe that glory so like I said sowing and reaping is a simple principle of God and it comes from way before the finishing of the world is it full of God and God her thoughts thoughts thoughts on his mind and soon a ripping he was one of his thoughts one of his principles amen and God's thoughts is there are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways as you prefer the richer you say my thoughts are not your thoughts in other words my thoughts on sowing and reaping and not the same as your thoughts on sowing and reaping and I prove that you in a minute if some my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways because you have thoughts and then you have ways to make thus those thoughts come to pass amen and God said for as the heavens are high above the earth so are my thoughts higher than your thoughts and my ways higher than your ways I have thoughts I have ways of going about my things that are so much higher than your ways and your thoughts but if you take on this up here you will never understand what I'm about and that's why Jesus came those religious people were so earthbound they could never figure him out and that's why people cannot figure this message out because this message is the manna God is the Son of God from the foundation of the world in so much higher than anything this world has ever found a man you may be seated if you understand what you are received what this message represents and I hope God will help me to be able to show you I hope I don't keep it till 1 o'clock to where you will understand and know that the Christian life is easy say easy it's easier than leaving I don't believe in life he say it's hard life is hard you may be seated life is hard go as the baby in the womb way it's protected everything it wants to eat it kicks his mother some more makes the mother feel hungry the mother eats food and the baby gets fed but once the time comes the baby comes of age that baby comes on the face of the earth here it's very fast second on the earth you say welcome to the world baby is it to fall you are in so don't tell me Christine is tough because going to school is tough going to work is tough going to the family family stuff everything is tough life is tough but compared to all of that this cosplay is easy because God is your enabler combated easy for you to live a Christian life unless you don't want to is not hard but unders it's easy can I use your MA already you may be seated it'll be so out of character for God to make live in a Christian life for a surgeon or is it difficult so out of character for God you say he will abundantly pardon he said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly so he's here to give you a point on here you are the only one in your school is he here to give you a pond on hell what you cannot do for use that the practicality for yourself he cannot do that for you because you can plant a seed and pick up the fallow ground in your natural and the natural one and put a seal in there but if the seed has to do some things of itself you pour water and over but that's it has to break out itself die and Jesus says and John 12:24 I believe except they color with fall into the ground and die it abides alone boy refers to the granite I shall bring forth fruit and more fruit a much fruit that's your you get a break up your fallow go yourself and do the dying yourself I can't do the time for you you can do the time for me your pastor can do the time for you you can do the damn for yourself for anybody else you go to the time for yourself that's a break up your fallow ground break up your spirit break up your own ways break up yourself Styles break up your spritz upon you you can do that yourself you may be seated Oh glory amen so like Adam where God's seed got seed of his word I like Adam we're gonna be reap as the flesh of the world the Word made flesh and that's why I say Malaka for already sold and planted the seed of the entire Bible and we have the see we have the word I'm people GMI but an analyst yesterday how dare you speak against the message but if you want to go on ahead but the angels here in it not threatening you not wouldn't fail you but the angel is hearing it when Ottoman is so way higher than the closest know which is panic oh so much higher they are fine painting cross-reference fine the pretty water God you here wow this is incredible this is great but when it comes to it is top speed yo it stops here it doesn't go way back but for the function of the world only one man William Branham have the ministry privation one if you say snow william branham you gotta find that man or you are going to say earthbound because Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him and which is sent by his angel unto his servant John you've got to find who that angel is if you say something like a four that's fine but you got a friend that angel because that revelation is going to show you things that are to be things that were before the words were from things that are the things that are to be no man no other man has that ministry to check into the mana card and bring costs Austin to you and I so we are the preview like this morning we have the thoughts of God in the form of a message so far higher than anything this world can ever produce so far higher than anything regular Christianity can never produce that you say [Music] [Applause] so let me show you that God's thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts so much higher than our ways because I'm got sword I'm planning his world he ripped perfection he saw his word let there be light and there was light and he has never had to make this Sun any better since he did it one time it's been as perfect as puffer could be if man could touch the Sun they would have changed it but God made sure you can't touch the Sun you just bask under the glories of the Sun God spoke let there be light and there was light and he's never had to walk on it his sword I'll read right away a profits earned that's been there ever since and the Bible says I believe in in Sam something he said he said as for God his way is perfect so when go saw some plants he always comes forth on the other side are they harvest with perfection is that clear do you believe that the source he plans it comes out with a prophet fruit perfect harvest glory Oh glory but us nothing man does is perfect the same principle sowing and reaping God applies the principle becomes a perfect world first day God created at the end of the day God saw everything he did was good in other words was perfect second day God said let there be this and let the other bring forth and all that and God saw it was good in other words was perfect because sword and the spoken word is the original seat that is sword the sword let their animals comfort let me let me let the sea bring for you whales and all of that and God saw that it was good every soil and plant in God did was perfect and good so why is I also implying not producing the same results because we are on a different plane from him or rather is on a different plane from us say as they have reserved of the earth so my waist up of your wish I my foot above your thoughts Oh God Almighty already glory so each time God sort his word he said he reflects in every single time and we also saw in reap but unlike God with already perfection nothing man does is perfect amen but like some 18 and verse 3 says as for God his way is perfect but we have never been able to come to that yet and welcome to that because he is sent a word the maracas for certain planning all of that a perfect bread will come forth to where she will speak under Warwick reserve just like that and you will see and see that it is good exactly what you spoke will come to pass Laure widow got a man that's why when got a precious gift in a proper whoever there's no margin of error wanker splits into a profit is exactly on the spot if it doesn't happen one time it's a problem there and these guys are spend all their lives trying to show and see where but the Brahma said someday or not happen you won't find it you can cook stuff up and disappear all who are children of disobedience while you will not see the bride because the bride shall never be deceived a man or a god swords and rips perfectional the challenge we sow and reap and with our perfection it means therefore the gosset thoughts also in a ribbon with superior to a thoughts on so in a ribbon far higher than our thoughts on sowing and reaping does that make sense to you or hallelujah nor will God so God's thoughts are totally on a totally more elevated level than our thoughts because it's those produce a perfect health is those produced a perfect camera villain is the produced a perfect creation it starts produce a perfect man stand on the face of the earth Amen now we've never been able to do that just yet little God now that's the difference between your thoughts and your thinking let me make that clear before I go on but as I'm speaking I'm using them interchangeably but there's a difference very bit differently your thoughts and your thinking we obviously I have thoughts first in my mind I'll show you how those thoughts come but God had thoughts on his mind how thoughts in mind I was not clear the world what was gonna be like first in his mind who was gonna be saved who wasn't gonna be saved but that wasn't his thinking thousands thinking the file is a powerful thing but the thinking is not powerful I wasn't reading scripture I think I forgot let this mind be in you I believe it's Philippians the second chapter verses 5 to 11 you can read when you get home asked if it was on my context and one of my scriptures let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God that's a very perplexing scripture but I'll show you the scriptures speaking about nothing about the three for mystery of God because it's only by the three for mystery of God that you're gonna see like that it's not robbery to be equal with God because God did tell me before the nation of the world God in Christ Christ in the bride going back to Eden a perfect man on the face of the earth I'm mature God's on the face of the earth so that was the three for missions was misspoken out there Jesus Christ sorry no robbery to be equal with God he needs something I just go and take it something that your labor and fight for it's not a gift it's something you labor and fight for but it's already given to you you might oh my lord so your thoughts all kinds of first come in your mind you can say I have thoughts I have bad thoughts that's the devil's job to put bad sauce in your mind but if you don't understand that's what you're thinking the devil will fool you because that is not your thinking amen another scripture says Amen I believe there is a Philippians 4 and verse 8 say whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things of a good report in other words there are different thoughts pure thoughts lovely thoughts good thoughts good reports all those thoughts are there this how you can you're thinking whatsoever things appear a lovely a harness of a good report think on these things you choose deliberately choose the thoughts you think on [Applause] any thought can come in your mind you can't tell the devil don't put this funny money on your mind it says chopped up what's on your mind but it's your job to choose your thinking let this mind be in you whatsoever things are pure that's what you think of that's what you think on these things glory glory can somebody shout hallelujah let me say let me say that again you maybe see that I'm just talking to you Amen the preachers a preacher right LEM just what y'all started to you it may may be seated are you following me are you falling out story the beautiful story of redemption your thoughts and your thinking two totally different things and brother Branham said your thoughts that's in your mind your mind that's the battleground you have good and you are bad there the devil poses first there goes forsythia to but it's up to you to choose your thinking and he said whatsoever things appear in other words of all the thoughts in your mind be deliberate be intentional to take the good thoughts the pure thoughts the harnessed thoughts the good reports that if he hear you think those thoughts will know you have a good report take those first and think on those things and meditate on those things and as you do that those thoughts become your thinking as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that's not you from who you are that's how you become who you are the devil can make you what he wants to be no he don't have the power the devil don't have the power and brother branham said make yourself a Christian being tensional be deliberate I will be a Christian I will have my thinking straighten out [Applause] but double cap whatever thoughts but I will not think on those thoughts I would change my thinking I will change my thoughts am I thinking will become Who I am because I see man thinketh it is that so easy you may be seated [Applause] that's what this gospel is not a gospel of do's and don'ts I can tell you don't do this here don't do that here that's not you yet who you are is comes from the inside as you think in your hat as you take those thoughts amen and meditate on those thoughts and let those thoughts come in and your thing and focus and fish on those thoughts in from your thinking from the inner man on the inside of you and that becomes who you are same way you couldn't do one thing wrong you could never do one thing wrong unless you became me thinking in your soul the devil don't have the power to make you do one thing wrong did you hear me but they ever don't have the power to make it do one thing wrong maybe see that I'm talking to you with Christian this way I am weak my money so messed up could you stand like a man face that devil say I'm a son of God here from here on out I'm gonna begin to choose my thinking and can who I am and make myself a Christian make yourself a Christian by changing the thoughts by taking your thoughts that you want but a good lovely harness good report I'm forming them and you're thinking you may be seated [Applause] so God have thoughts of everything that will happen from a tiny back to tiny again boy in his thinking was special thoughts and UI in his thinking Amen so I said you ain't got thoughts know that you've got to understand sitting and all is even was also in God's thoughts got knew what's gonna happen when he's thinking in his mind on the back part of his mind that's where he's thinking was and you're thinking the devil can't touch it because the water God is the incorruptible seed of the word of God nor man nor devil nor speak--and corrupted and the delicate corruptible porn with finish with music unless you'll allow him to do it he don't have the power [Applause] young man young woman he doesn't have the power you may be seated Lori cigar starts and goes thinking we higher than regular man's thoughts and thinking so when we come to the Lord when joined to think his thoughts and not our thoughts as the f55 why are we in general thing his thoughts because we're going back to Eden his thoughts is thinking produce the gamma V damn produce a perfect world and we are going to get back to that perfection we can't do this same kind of thinking like everybody has here Christian it'll shake yourself too many times with Finn la-de-da our mission accom I never going to change sure I never change but it's a growing up there's a grown up into him in all things you can grow up into him being a mediocre and Christian Bellamy joke attack Christian been a regular type a Christian no you cannot be because we're a super race to a super bright you a super Church as you near the great head zone I am super that's what I think of me and you were super you a super tell your neighbor but the challenge is arms in the cemetery neighbor you are super others boys and Gazan school you are not on the same level [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hori [Applause] all right amen you ever see that [Applause] [Music] so welcome to the Lord the Scriptures and join us to let this mind be in you which was also any question who would fight now robbery to be equal with gonna like I said that's speaking right there of a 3/4 ministry of God that was the only revelation that will make Jesus Christ then nothing is robbery to be equal with God he knew the process you don't just break in and get the character of the Son of God he knows the process the steps the procedure I know that God by spearonation Amen shows with him before the formation of the world and he knows the priesthood not to be equal with God when his wasn't robbery he was president miracle with God but I know he's not robbery there's a process that the step in successive steps now to get there and jesus knew that so that's speaking about the fee for ministry and when we become a Christian I said when come in this message here we enjoined to get rid of our thoughts and begin to think his thoughts because we're going back to Eden amen we've got to go back first to the thoughts and the thinking that produce Eden in the first place or we'll never go about there that's what won't you everybody else talking the my vision is always a very popular topic um offer any courses mentioned songs I've gone I'm supposed to go like but the fuel pellets and they can have like tempura already power but permanent power stays with you the only caused by the same thinking the produce it in the first instance but the perm said if you split the world by the same thinking that produce the world in the first place you will get the same resource and this process here is about God walked in on the inside of us to get us to move our thinking to a totally different level by his preeminence is in our souls in our hearts in our lives the water God living in you and I in preeminence Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh mama amen lorry let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus whatsoever things appear think of these things because the man thinketh in his heart so he adds and leaves so is he your thoughts your thinking that's your inner man that's your spirit man on the inside of you that's a spiritual heart on the instead of you I don't which flow all of your life all the issues of the life come from that thinking in that spirit man on the instead of you Oh unfortunately too many of us funny very difficult to elevate our thinking to God's level of thinking does never love thinking for you your circumstances your life your job your Christian walk your family your career your job for every area of your life we find it so difficult to elevate our thinking to the level that goes is my thoughts are higher than your thoughts I'm always higher than your ways and when you come up to his level of thinking you will see the way how he achieves that thinking to make it coming to a manifestation but why are you staying your level of thinking you'll be struggling against the booze and trying to make those thoughts come to pass I'm a Christian and you are struggling there's no struggling Christian if you are struggling as a Christian some is not right young man hear me young woman hear me if you are struggling as a Christian something is not right the only way a Christian struggles you struggle in prayer with God to get on your knees baggy at the knees during labor in solo travail with God but a Christian don't struggle to not sin Laura door goddamn man can I get a witness back I can't hear you a Christian don't struggle to not sin because the speed of God this speeder cut off a came the devil how are you going to struggle against the devil anymore the daily struggle against Goliath Israel struggle but not David they will run into the army grunting aloud with confidence that's a fast shadow of a Christian hallelujah there's a challenge we don't deny that a challenge there but we'll face it an elevated level of thinking a good level of thinking and we said to every challenge this Egyptians your city there you shall see them no more forever you say like David you come against me the name of your gods but I come against you in the name of the lord god of the heavens and earth whom you have defied don't you understand you may be seated don't you understand you may be seated [Applause] don't you understand that every challenge that comes at you to make the Word of God looks like it's a lie don't you understand that that challenge is to find the god of the heavens and the earth and David without the Holy Ghost he said I will not stand for it I will not let you to find my god or defy his armies and David went to face Goliath every challenge I was like a Goliath you face it at an elevated level of thinking we are not going to print like Israel we're going to face it and we're gonna profess how's it going you'll fall at my feet those are not man's words as my thoughts are higher than the earth so are my thoughts on my ways higher than your ways [Applause] proceeded israel and saw their thoughts where grasshoppers before Goliath to forego lieth you need years of experience that's the way to to bring this victory the comparison is years of experience you need this ammo that you wear the ammo you are called by everywhere that's man's thoughts and his ways to achieve what he thought what needs to be achieved but come to a man who has reached that level the elevated level of thinking thinking differently than the rest of the group who care nothing about being popular with the rest of the group mi wash can alone if you have to stand alone stand alone hallelujah and David came he began to speak like no no other manner ever spoken baby said your servant so I am your seven but is on second self listen I will go and fight him I will kill him today so cringe don't talk like that young man don't talk like that don't talk like that he's a man of war from his youth oh not just a small boy because he was living at this level here I wanted to keep David at that level of thinking don't let them do it to you don't let no challenge no circumstance nothing keep you have a level of thinking you a needle flop your eagle wings and soar into the heavens you are not kicking you wanna add one creature flying to the skies where thoughts are high the man's thoughts raceways a higher the man's ways hallelujah [Applause] there is bogus votes and it showed us ways of confronting the challenge my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways my thoughts are we higher on a different level I think different than you think are my ways are different than the way you would do it my way me look stupid but they are so different for me always you will never see the richness the abundance of the glories of the thinking of a lord that's who you are you are cross rich thoughts you know Papa I defy every Philistine that's holding any young man young man here this morning parents if you are here and any Philistine is holding your child pound I don't care what that demon is please no cliche now change your thinking think differently don't be like Israel give me your eyes on Cola that's holding your son or go to the pound raise your thinking and speak to that devil speak to that devil that's holding your son that's all your Torah in an Obama and over papa I see the chains falling I'll see the shackles breaking I need any devil holes open today because shackles come on over here hiya come up higher you got Authority and scenario over every devil [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] hey brother I feel like running through a troop when you get this level of thinking will begin to break into the realm to where you know that all things are possible to him that believeth whatever devil you raise up to that level and that's where I got st. Malachi 4 with a message from the man of God to elevate you into the level of thinking you got to think differently you got to think different from the regular man on DVDs your example so many examples in the Bible maybe see the glory [Applause] cerebus coconuts and why israel was running from Goliath God's ways are different from your ways higher than your ways they will run to meet Goliath do you fight every military strategy of the time this snowball David so became an general the the greatest war colleges in human history up till tomorrow as taught in his war tactics David's tactics meaning Goliath a minute general in the Israeli army that's why they Jewish the Israeli are so so fantastic in their army and their recognizance the spy work and things because David Moses Joshua Adam said we set the foundation for them because the operating from a different level of thinking more than the regular man you know regular man / Superman not because you want to be but God made you sore but many of you are not leaving like that all right why it's gonna change from this convention onwards all you need to do is change your thinking I'm not talking about motivational
