[13:11] word be spoken to your people that they
[13:13] may receive into their hearts that will
[13:16] change the course of their lives so many
[13:18] things are connected to decisions
[13:20] decisions in our minds decisions in our
[13:23] hearts an action based upon the
[13:25] decisions that we have in our hearts may
[13:28] it be an action to the people tonight
[13:30] that they would see their lives not just
[13:32] going through the motion but making
[13:34] intentional decisions as to how to act
[13:37] how to behave how to react how to call
[13:40] upon your name how to seek you your own
[13:42] disciples one time ask you teach us how
[13:45] to pray because they saw John disciples
[13:47] praying they saw John praying they saw
[13:49] Jesus praying and they wanted to know
[13:51] how it is that they could effectively
[13:53] pray how they could receive from you
[13:55] teach us tonight we need to hear from
[13:58] you we are waiting upon you granted Lord
[14:00] in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God
[14:03] bless you and thanks for being here
[14:04] tonight we appreciate all of you who
[14:07] choose to have fellowship with us
[14:08] tonight around the word and we're going
[14:10] to share a few thoughts and then we're
[14:12] going to get on in
[14:13] prayer I want to read two portion of
[14:16] scripture one from Matthew chapter 6 I
[14:18] want to read
[14:19] 30-34 and Mark 1013
[14:22] to15 Matthew 6 reading verse 30
[14:26] wherefore if God so clothe the grass of
[14:28] the field
[14:29] this is Jesus which today is and
[14:32] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[14:35] not much more clothe you or ye have
[14:38] little
[14:39] faith
[14:40] therefore take no
[14:43] thought saying what shall we eat what
[14:47] shall we drink or where shall we be
[14:51] clothed for after all these things do
[14:53] the Gentile seek for heavenly father
[14:56] knoweth that he have need of these
[14:58] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[15:01] God and his righteousness and all these
[15:04] things shall be added unto you take
[15:06] therefore no thought for tomorrow for
[15:09] the morrow shall take thought for the
[15:11] things of itself sufficient unto the
[15:15] days the evil thereof Mark 10 want to
[15:18] read from verse
[15:19] 13 and they brought young children to
[15:22] him about Jesus that he should touch
[15:25] them and his disciples rebuked those
[15:28] that brought them
[15:29] but when Jesus saw it he was much
[15:32] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[15:36] little children to come unto me and
[15:38] forbid them not for of such is the
[15:42] kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[15:46] whosoever list is it here now shall not
[15:49] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[15:53] child he shall not enter therein may God
[15:57] bless his word
[15:59] I have a question tonight what is it to
[16:02] seek first the kingdom of
[16:06] God you know we ask God for things we
[16:09] ask God for family for healing for
[16:12] breakthrough for deliverance but that is
[16:15] not exactly seeking the kingdom that is
[16:19] we are still asking for things and Jesus
[16:22] was telling the disciples that the
[16:24] Gentiles seek after things but he wants
[16:28] you to seek the first the kingdom and
[16:31] these other things will be added now the
[16:36] word first seek first gives the weight
[16:40] of what you have as a priority and the
[16:42] work to seek is to go after to go after
[16:46] to receive to go after to get seek
[16:49] diligently so it's not as if you are
[16:52] casual about it you are making an
[16:54] intentional effort to go after so this
[16:58] word
[16:59] first means that he's asking to realign
[17:04] your priorities it means adjusting your
[17:06] priorities what is first and foremost on
[17:08] your mind when you wake up when you go
[17:11] to sleep is it the kingdom is it the
[17:14] holy ghost or is it things is it people
[17:18] first means prioritizing God's will and
[17:23] his purpose above everything else in
[17:25] your
[17:26] life making God's desires and plans
[17:30] Central in our lives letting his
[17:34] principles and word guide our choices
[17:37] and actions because you have to really
[17:40] believe that life is not just natural
[17:42] going to work going to home going to
[17:44] church driving a car and whatnot but
[17:46] life is also spiritual in a truest sense
[17:49] we want to be able to be living seeking
[17:52] for the kingdom according to God's
[17:55] standard according to God's character
[17:58] according to God's word growth in your
[18:02] life you must be able to see growth in
[18:06] your life not a stagnant broken system
[18:10] but an Ever vescent spring of
[18:13] water what this is doing by Jesus
[18:16] telling people don't take on these
[18:18] things don't take on what morold and
[18:20] take on this and take on clothes and
[18:22] food you know like they have the basic
[18:24] thing what you need is shelter food and
[18:27] clothing he said don't let that bother
[18:31] you and stress you out then but you have
[18:33] to put trust and you have to see by
[18:37] putting the kingdom
[18:39] first that you are trusting in his word
[18:43] that he will take care of you so De
[18:46] Jesus he is trying to get the people
[18:50] away from being anxious about Earthly
[18:54] things or Earthly
[18:56] concerns being anxious
[18:59] or anxiety is a reflection of a lack of
[19:03] trust so you have to do you have to you
[19:06] know you're all tense up you're all
[19:08] tight because you're anxious will it
[19:10] work out will not work out this trust
[19:14] listen carefully this trust that Jesus
[19:17] wants from us is what is reflected in a
[19:22] child children trust
[19:26] easily and fully
[19:29] without questions and wondering if you
[19:31] tell a child I'm going to bring a
[19:32] chocolate to you this evening that child
[19:35] have no doubt that that chocolate coming
[19:37] and when you reach by the door by the
[19:39] gate he's looking out or she's looking
[19:41] out for that chocolate so they have an
[19:44] natural instinct or belief that the
[19:48] parents or the Guardians whoever taking
[19:50] care of them will protect and provide
[19:54] for them that's why Jesus said consider
[19:57] the lies consider the bird of the field
[19:59] did he not spin or toil and yet God
[20:02] provides for them because he is in
[20:04] charge of them so Jesus is calling us to
[20:09] trust
[20:11] trust him
[20:13] completely and he said it this way
[20:15] therefore take no thought saying what
[20:18] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[20:21] where it all shall we be clothed you are
[20:24] Believing on his goodness you are
[20:26] Believing on his love you are Believing
[20:29] on his
[20:30] promises even when you don't even
[20:33] understand what is happening you are
[20:35] believing listen what B said
[20:37] here message is is it I you said many
[20:40] times I wonder sometimes how so many
[20:42] things happen it is just simple prayer I
[20:46] come up I pray for someone maybe dimes
[20:49] sakas cancer or something just eaten up
[20:52] and after a while along the road you
[20:55] remember me brother Brandon I was the
[20:57] one that was so and so tens of thousands
[20:59] R around you see listen it is just
[21:03] simple fi it is nothing anything that we
[21:06] work ourselves up to is just something
[21:10] that we believe like a child would
[21:13] believe just like you promis your little
[21:16] girl a New Dress Saturday the little boy
[21:20] a overall jacket see they expect that
[21:24] just simply childlike fate that's all
[21:28] God wants us to be because we are just
[21:31] his children in any my title tonight is
[21:34] receive as a child the kingdom of God so
[21:38] he is saying here just as you promise
[21:40] your little girl a new dress you promise
[21:43] your boy a jacket and they just expect
[21:46] that that is simple childlike faith that
[21:50] we could pray Lord touch my brother heal
[21:52] him in Jesus name touch him take away
[21:55] this in Jesus name and you just believe
[21:57] that and you walk away simple childlike
[22:00] fate so Jesus was trying to tell the
[22:04] disciples we have got to get our
[22:06] prorities right you cannot put listen
[22:11] material things over spiritual things so
[22:15] Jesus was saying don't worry about
[22:19] material things don't worry about the
[22:22] food and the drink and the clothing seek
[22:24] first the kingdom have a spiritual
[22:28] Pursuit have one that you're actually
[22:31] seeking spiritual things it's about
[22:34] valuing things that are Eternal instead
[22:38] of what is
[22:39] temporary status wealth now status and
[22:43] wealth bring peace and comfort from the
[22:47] anxiety about material concerns because
[22:50] if you had money you went studying what
[22:53] house to buy or what car to buy or or if
[22:56] you have paid doctor bills or whatever
[22:57] it is you just have the money you just
[22:59] do what you have to do you go where you
[23:01] have to go so it's a it's a it's a
[23:03] weight off from the material but in God
[23:06] stretching it out in this way where he
[23:09] could say take no thought he is
[23:11] encouraging us to trust him he's
[23:15] encouraging us to surrender and this is
[23:18] what a child does and listen to this we
[23:22] have to understand that seeking first
[23:24] the kingdom of God involves surrendering
[23:28] our own
[23:30] desire our own ways and trusting in his
[23:35] sovereignity now man I see they love
[23:38] control we like to control things I'm
[23:41] not talking about male man I'm talking
[23:42] about man which is woman and man male
[23:46] female control their parents that want
[23:49] to control their children their mothers
[23:51] they are in charge of their children
[23:53] they figure they have control that is a
[23:55] problem in seeking first what God's want
[23:59] from you so therefore we have to trust
[24:04] that God in his
[24:05] sovereignity he would work things out
[24:08] well like you know often talk about
[24:10] Romans 8:28 and we know all things work
[24:12] together for good right then I'm not
[24:14] love God what we are actually seeing I'm
[24:18] yielding my fears I am yielding my plans
[24:22] I am yielding my ambitions to you to you
[24:27] God and you are seeing that knowing that
[24:31] he knows the end from the beginning and
[24:33] he is smarter than us he's wiser than us
[24:36] and I could trust in his decision and
[24:39] guiding me he would lead me right now
[24:43] the
[24:45] challenge is whether or not we would
[24:48] rock back and say well God will work it
[24:50] out and we do nothing that is not what
[24:53] he is saying here because we want to be
[24:55] able to have I call it the action of
[25:00] faith in seeking God you're not just
[25:03] waiting upon the Lord and doing nothing
[25:06] but you are making those steps of action
[25:12] in
[25:13] obedience in taking courage like how God
[25:16] Joshua be courageous in making
[25:19] sacrifices to show God your responding
[25:22] to his voice and his call there are too
[25:25] many Christian just sit back it's almost
[25:27] like they they in relaxed mode and
[25:30] they're not doing anything to draw nigh
[25:33] to God he said draw nigh to me I'll Draw
[25:36] N to you resist the devil and he would
[25:39] flee from you there's an effort and
[25:42] there's an intent in doing these things
[25:45] question tonight where are your
[25:48] steps where are those action that you
[25:52] know you should take the big issue for
[25:55] some of you is
[25:57] pride and was sham my wife tonight I can
[26:01] never saw it that way before called
[26:04] pride in this way Pride I wrote down
[26:07] these things keep you
[26:09] independent you ask no
[26:12] questions you ask no
[26:14] guidance you are not interested in God's
[26:17] thoughts on the matter because you are
[26:19] more interested in what you think what
[26:22] you want what you desire you have
[26:26] pummeled and bulli your way true life
[26:29] your own way which is actually
[26:32] selfish you don't
[26:34] ask because you don't want to admit that
[26:37] you don't know and to me it's
[26:41] Pride so you pretend and guess what you
[26:45] still don't know you are not humble it's
[26:48] a lack of
[26:49] humility and this is what a child has
[26:54] humility except you be as a little child
[26:58] I know this may sound light tonight but
[27:00] this is not
[27:01] light this is not light listen carefully
[27:06] children recognize their dependence on
[27:10] others particularly on
[27:12] adults and Jesus he said accept you be
[27:16] like a child don't stop the children let
[27:18] them come because the the
[27:20] kingdom works with that kind of spirit
[27:23] that kind of attitude the children are
[27:27] dependent
[27:28] the children as a child they don't
[27:31] exercise that
[27:32] independent and we have to be able to
[27:36] show God our dependency on him now if
[27:39] you're dependent of God you just can't
[27:41] walk out the house without prayer with
[27:43] you know acknowledging him and giving
[27:45] some worship because you are dependent
[27:48] on him no man could live without God
[27:50] when I saying that live the life normal
[27:53] make money normal go to work have this
[27:55] and whatever it is and there's not even
[27:57] a God in the taught he just living a
[27:59] normal life but we're not speaking about
[28:02] that we spoken speaking about what God
[28:04] expecting of us seeking the kingdom
[28:08] involves transforming your
[28:11] views that you could begin to see things
[28:14] to a spiritual lend instead of seeing
[28:17] natural somebody do you somebody affect
[28:19] you you don't like this one and if this
[28:22] one could you move off of the scene and
[28:24] you invest in natural you fighting
[28:26] against flesh and blood cousin and aunt
[28:28] and uncle and you need Flesh and Blood
[28:30] more you're not seeing through the
[28:33] spiritual lens to the eyes of the Lord
[28:35] godam said
[28:37] this all right very good talk about
[28:40] Jesus he was just one man the perfect
[28:42] man the Cal he gave his life and he made
[28:46] an example for you what must we do the
[28:49] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[28:53] live for himself listen to these words I
[28:55] want you to forget everything else
[28:58] listen to this here Jesus never live for
[29:01] himself there's not a text there's not
[29:03] talking Mysteries and all that his life
[29:07] was spent for others that is perfect
[29:11] eternal life when you say you go to
[29:13] church and you do good things that is
[29:17] fine but when you live your life to
[29:20] yourself you haven't eternal life and
[29:23] this is what I see now people are living
[29:25] in a bubble they in church but they in
[29:28] their own bubble they in their own world
[29:31] they're shaking hands through that
[29:32] bubble God bless you through that bubble
[29:35] but in a bubble God want to pun you with
[29:38] a little pin you a bubble PS and punch
[29:41] you that bubble that you could recognize
[29:43] you have to be connected you have to be
[29:45] relating you have to be uh connecting to
[29:48] your brothers and sisters and so like
[29:50] that now he
[29:51] says but when you live your life to
[29:54] yourself you haven't eternal life so
[29:57] eternal life
[29:58] is connected with living for others
[30:01] going Beyond yourself and that is where
[30:04] you are
[30:05] motivated to do much more because you're
[30:08] not serving you selfishness narcissism
[30:13] and you thinking about you and your what
[30:15] your interest is that is self-centered
[30:18] It could only go so far and no more as
[30:21] we see God's
[30:22] kingdom we are called to press on to a
[30:25] life of Holiness striving to become more
[30:28] like Jesus and this process is what we
[30:31] call sanctification this is the hard
[30:33] part this is the legalistic part this is
[30:35] the part where you fast you pray you die
[30:37] out you bring your flesh in subjection
[30:39] you put your feelings aside and let the
[30:42] word come forward because you are
[30:44] choosing this is what it it means
[30:46] confessing your sins and turning away
[30:48] from Habits that are hindering you
[30:52] confessing your sins because if you
[30:54] don't confess your sins the devil have
[30:56] stuff on you yeah stuff he could say no
[30:59] look he's this way she's this way he did
[31:01] that he did that and there's no
[31:03] confession so you have you have
[31:05] something on you then but when you
[31:07] confess and you repent to God because
[31:09] this is what God wants you acknowledge
[31:10] your ways acknowledge your bad behavior
[31:13] or attitude and say Lord I need you God
[31:16] could come and Minister and restore you
[31:19] forgive you and help you so let me hit
[31:20] the home shet here
[31:22] now children see the world simply with
[31:26] no complications
[31:28] no bias that ad dos have their hearts
[31:30] and motives are pure they approach
[31:34] people with no pretense No Agenda that
[31:38] is what a child had no hidden you ask
[31:41] that child a question the child answer
[31:43] you ask a Dos are question oh my God got
[31:45] to watch the carefully because they
[31:47] don't want to say this because this
[31:49] hidden here and they hiding something
[31:51] here and they don't you know this not a
[31:53] child a child will come and say daddy
[31:55] and mommy was doing this or this
[31:57] happened and happen and the child freely
[31:59] saying whatever it the
[32:03] child is opening to learn from those
[32:06] around them the child and Jesus want us
[32:10] to be like that to be shaped in a way
[32:13] where he could speak to us anything and
[32:14] we could receive it children forgive
[32:17] quickly this the part I just love no ODS
[32:20] no grudge when we have grandchildren
[32:22] some you know give them a little jle and
[32:24] whatnot cry but they come right back the
[32:27] mother might put a licks father might
[32:29] rough them or whatnot they might cry in
[32:31] a corner but they come right back why
[32:34] they cannot hold Arts they don't know
[32:36] what Arts is they get upset they cry and
[32:39] whatnot and like that but they come
[32:40] right back to mommy or daddy or right
[32:42] back to Grandpa and Grandma this is our
[32:44] children they hold no
[32:45] grudges except for be like a
[32:49] child they are willing to reconcile and
[32:52] let go of
[32:54] offenses this is what God wants of us
[32:58] loving others freely children find joy
[33:03] in simple things free from worries you
[33:07] buy a little car you buy a big car they
[33:09] happy drive it up and down like I those
[33:12] grand boys and whatever you buy a
[33:14] balloon they will blow it whatever
[33:15] whatever and they happy they get
[33:17] something new it might it might not last
[33:19] the whole day but they enjoy it while
[33:23] they
[33:24] can they not weigh down they have Joy
[33:28] they have joy children are unafraid to
[33:32] admit that they need
[33:35] help and how and they honor they're not
[33:38] afraid to share how they're vulnerable I
[33:41] fell I fell and they crying the knee
[33:43] hurting and what not they say where you
[33:45] get hurt and the elbow and they bring
[33:47] the elbow and show the elbow and the
[33:48] more you do it the more they cry and
[33:50] they say okay I'll fix fix it give it a
[33:52] kiss and and the tears is gone you know
[33:55] Grandpa could fix fix
[33:58] and so on like that children are also
[34:01] quick to learn and they're eager to
[34:04] absorb more knowledge more information
[34:06] that questions the eager to ask
[34:08] questions and to learn children display
[34:11] great generosity in giving in Sharing I
[34:14] just run too quickly children don't hold
[34:18] biases and judgment towards others they
[34:21] accept people as they are children they
[34:26] love connections a c here a friend here
[34:29] a Believer here whatever it is they
[34:30] would laugh Run play That's How children
[34:33] are and the last thing I have here
[34:36] children are
[34:39] transparent expressing their feelings is
[34:41] a term that Isaac uses a remember now
[34:44] that the children they might be blunt
[34:47] but they are honest they are truthful
[34:49] and we may call it plain Jan they will
[34:51] tell it like it is God help us to be
[34:54] like that they don't need to hide they
[34:57] don't need to pretend they are honest
[35:01] they are authentic they are original
[35:04] they are their true selves and this is
[35:07] what God wants of us tonight to receive
[35:10] the kingdom in all honesty and
[35:12] simplicity Jacob said I am Jacob you
[35:16] know good I'm I'm a trickster you have
[35:19] to be open and honest I'm a liar my tee
[35:23] I luster I whatever it is that you could
[35:26] tell God and God come tonight forgive me
[35:28] and cleanse me and Purge me and Purify
[35:30] Me I want to tell you about I am I want
[35:33] to you see God knows about you but you
[35:36] have to confess it to him that's the law
[35:38] that he put in forgiveness if you shall
[35:40] confess your sins he is faithful and
[35:42] just to forgive you of your sins not if
[35:44] you think about your sins in your mind
[35:46] and and it in your mind no his words say
[35:50] if you confess he is faithful and just
[35:52] to forgive you of your sins and cleanse
[35:54] you from all unrighteousness just a few
[35:56] more and we're close just a two more
[36:00] if you can believe on the Lord Jesus
[36:01] Christ not only for salvation for
[36:03] yourself or for your loved ones or for
[36:05] the healing of a child or a mother or
[36:07] anything that you desire that's right if
[36:09] you know if you desire something that
[36:11] wasn't right listen if you desire
[36:15] something that wasn't right you wouldn't
[36:18] have Fai enough to ask God in the first
[36:21] place because you know it ain't right if
[36:24] you are sincere and know that it is
[36:26] right then you can ask God with a clean
[36:28] heart knowing it's no selfish motive
[36:32] your objective and your motive is
[36:34] exactly right then ask God like a child
[36:38] believe you'll get it and you get it now
[36:42] we are going to start off with the early
[36:44] church and that just brings it about
[36:45] five minutes now what they did the great
[36:48] vision I have for the future now at the
[36:50] beginning the church was inaugurated at
[36:52] Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell
[36:54] upon them where Jesus had chosen 12
[36:58] and one of them had fallen they had to
[37:00] choose Maas to take his place and the
[37:02] Holy Spirit listen waited until all this
[37:07] was in order before it come they had to
[37:11] choose one to take the Bishop Rick of
[37:13] Judas that fell by transgression to
[37:16] fulfill the scripture and I'm closing
[37:18] this last quote and I believe all these
[37:21] things have a time of lingering
[37:24] listen and sometimes you ask ask God for
[37:28] something you're seeking God and God
[37:31] lingers he says nothing but you have to
[37:34] wait all these things have a time of
[37:36] lingering waiting and it's waiting for a
[37:39] time for the scripture to be fulfilled
[37:42] till everything gets right everything is
[37:44] in order many times we get impatient
[37:47] like a child we get great anticipation
[37:51] and many time we jump ahead and that
[37:53] hinders the work until the works get
[37:56] caught up we must must move reverently
[37:59] of a purpose in heart that God listen if
[38:03] he would desire to use us in such and
[38:05] such but wait till he makes the opening
[38:09] because he has to go ahead of us if you
[38:13] don't wait for God to make an opening
[38:16] and for God to show the
[38:18] way you will
[38:21] crash you would end up in
[38:23] a in it's in a pickle you will end up in
[38:26] difficulties
[38:28] because you haven't let go enough to say
[38:31] you know Lord You're we sometime in
[38:34] releasing things to God it may seem very
[38:37] hard but it's God's will it is God's
[38:41] plan it is God's sovereignity and if you
[38:44] accept that brother Bram was working
[38:47] hard when they had the flood and the
[38:49] boat and his wife got sick and he
[38:51] helping to get this one and helping that
[38:53] one and that one and that one but then
[38:56] he was actually under
[38:58] Disobedience he did not obey what God
[39:00] has said and it brought a reaction to
[39:03] his own family that brought the effect
[39:06] his wife died his child died it was a
[39:10] serious test of faith for him but he
[39:12] didn't obey God the way God wanted him
[39:15] to
[39:16] obey and friends we get test we get test
[39:21] on obedience we get test if you really
[39:22] believe the word we get test and God is
[39:24] seeing our reaction to this this was
[39:27] very notable to me because it
[39:30] challenge this attitude that we are okay
[39:34] when we are not it challenges it that we
[39:36] pretend and we are not and here is the
[39:38] word tell us get down to be like a child
[39:42] in other words I trust tonight that
[39:45] you could begin to see something what a
[39:48] child sees especially with no ODS no
[39:51] grudge especially with authenticity
[39:54] freedom to speak not uh um you know on
[39:57] your had to think hard because you had
[39:59] to be careful how your words span out no
[40:01] no no no no like I tell a brother one
[40:03] time I say everything that I speak to
[40:05] you you could speak to anybody I'm not a
[40:07] whispering Pastor I don't whisper say sh
[40:09] don't tell anybody as it's you talking
[40:11] to you by yourself nothing to that I
[40:13] want to be able to speak from my heart
[40:16] and to speak truth and be what is right
[40:18] and if I could speak speak what is right
[40:20] to you then I could speak to right to
[40:23] God if you cannot be honest with your
[40:25] fellow man how could you be genuinely
[40:27] sincere to God something is wrong and
[40:30] let me tell you something I sh is my son
[40:33] Gideon and I said I'll close with this
[40:35] know I'll spend a little more time
[40:36] tonight I said like in the realm of the
[40:38] spirit if in your spirit have say pure
[40:41] colors and something is wrong consider
[40:44] and picture if the color is Muddy so you
[40:47] get a muddy red or a muddy yellow or
[40:49] muddy whatever just talking about in the
[40:51] real of the spirit and that is what is
[40:54] vibrating out of you in the realm of the
[40:57] spirit that is what is emanating from
[41:00] you a negative a muddy not correctly
[41:04] colored how you're supposed to be and
[41:07] regardless how nice your words are
[41:09] spoken it cannot change what you are
[41:12] giving out so when you have the colors
[41:16] right you have the right motive and
[41:18] objective every devil in hell could see
[41:21] what is vibrating off of you and this is
[41:24] what brother Bram could Des when the man
[41:27] came up on the platform he could say you
[41:30] not here for healing you're a minister
[41:32] you're here for Revival you are
[41:34] Christian what is it that brother
[41:37] brandham is seeing them to say you are
[41:39] Christian he's not living by them he's
[41:41] not going by home by them it is
[41:43] something that is vibrating out of that
[41:46] person that tells that is a Christian
[41:50] friends this is what I have to share for
[41:52] you tonight that I want to quote it back
[41:56] receive as a child the kingdom of God
[42:00] let's bow our heads heavenly father I
[42:01] thank you tonight these are the words
[42:04] that I felt I wanted to share with your
[42:05] people tonight and I pray it goes down
[42:08] in every heart may they see how the
[42:10] children are dependent that's a problem
[42:13] with adults they act so independent they
[42:16] don't seek counsel they don't seek
[42:18] advice they don't see the leading of the
[42:20] Lord they do what they want to do I went
[42:22] in Crash pray prayer requests pray for
[42:24] me and whatnot but they don't have to go
[42:26] through that Lord Lord as that song
[42:28] Right said what what what what so much
[42:30] peace we forfeit so much pain we Bear
[42:33] all because we do not carry Everything
[42:35] To God In Prayer may it be corrected
[42:37] tonight as we humble ourselves get off
[42:40] the pride horse and just simply wait on
[42:42] you call upon you seek and ask you and
[42:46] if they are mothers fathers brothers
[42:47] sisters husband and wives here with
[42:49] pride in their hearts may they repent
[42:51] tonight ask you God to take it out of
[42:53] their hearts and their lives because
[42:55] your word say you resist the proud you
[42:57] fight the proud they could call
[42:58] Christianity and they are in church and
[43:00] they Christians but if they are proud
[43:02] you resist them you push them back you
[43:04] come against them but you give grace to
[43:06] the humble God every humble heart here
[43:08] tonight that heard these words may you
[43:11] give them a extra blessing tonight as
[43:13] they call upon you in prayer in Jesus
[43:15] name I ask it amen and amen I trust in
[43:18] that these few words would have been
[43:19] edifying to you and helpful to you may
[43:22] God bless you and big down in prayer in
[43:24] Jesus name amen God be with you and B
[43:26] down in pray prayer raise the Lord
