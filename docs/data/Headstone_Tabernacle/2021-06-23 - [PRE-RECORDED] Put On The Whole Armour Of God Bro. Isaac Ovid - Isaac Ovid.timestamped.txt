[30:04] and i'd like to go straight to the word
[30:06] if you have your bibles
[30:08] would you turn with me to two portions
[30:10] of scripture
[30:12] you want to read from the book of
[30:13] ephesians and we'll
[30:15] read from the book of jude
[30:18] through scriptures this morning thank
[30:19] you musicians thank you brother gideon
[30:21] for the
[30:22] worship this morning amen
[30:28] so ephesians chapter 6 and reading
[30:32] from verse 10. finally my brethren be
[30:36] strong in the lord
[30:38] and in the power of his might so it's
[30:41] not even your might
[30:42] and your strength is not your strength
[30:44] but your strength is in the lord
[30:47] finally my brethren be strong in the
[30:50] lord and in the power of his
[30:52] might put on the whole armor of god that
[30:54] he may be able to stand
[30:56] against the wiles of the devil for we
[30:59] wrestle
[31:00] not against flesh and blood but against
[31:02] principalities
[31:03] against powers against the rulers of the
[31:06] darkness of this world
[31:08] against spiritual wickedness in high
[31:11] places
[31:12] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[31:15] of god that he may be able to withstand
[31:17] in the evil day and having done
[31:18] all to stand stand there for having your
[31:22] loins get about with truth and having on
[31:24] the breastplate of righteousness
[31:26] and your feet shod with the preparation
[31:29] of the gospel of peace
[31:30] and above all taking the shield of faith
[31:33] where it
[31:33] he shall be able to quench all the fiery
[31:36] darts of the wicked
[31:37] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[31:39] sword of the spirit
[31:41] which is the word of god and reading
[31:43] from jude
[31:45] reading from chapter 1 reading verse 3
[31:49] jude 1 3 beloved
[31:52] when i give all diligence to write unto
[31:54] you of the common salvation
[31:56] it was needful for me to write unto you
[31:59] and exhort you
[32:01] that you should earnestly contend for
[32:03] the faith which was once delivered
[32:05] unto the sins can we bow our heads for a
[32:08] word of prayer heavenly father we thank

[32:32] be encouraged father because there's
[32:34] power in the word there's
[32:36] healing in the world your prophet taught
[32:38] us rapture and
[32:39] fate is laying in the word it's in the
[32:41] message lord there's power in a message
[32:43] it's a vindicated
[32:45] messages are vindicated worded it needs
[32:47] no more vindication it's already
[32:49] vindicated it's already real
[32:51] it already pushed back the devil every
[32:53] single time
[32:54] and lord we come this morning to apply
[32:56] the word to our lives

[52:02] morning
[52:03] because we have access to the power of
[52:06] god
[52:07] many people want to access all kinds of
[52:09] stuff but you have
[52:11] automatic access to the blood and his
[52:14] grace
[52:14] and predestination that's what you have
[52:17] working for you
[52:18] you are predestinated that's working for
[52:21] you
[52:22] your predestination is working for you
[52:25] your predestination is greater than your
[52:28] failure
[52:29] your predestination is bigger than your
[52:32] sin
[52:32] your predestination is bigger than your
[52:35] present condition
[52:36] your predestination is bigger than what
[52:39] your mama
[52:40] said about you your predestination is
[52:43] bigger than what the devil
[52:44] says about you because your
[52:46] predestination
[52:48] takes you to your guaranteed destination
[52:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:59] hallelujah it's because
[53:02] he fought you he could predestinate you
[53:05] because he foreknew you he could call
[53:09] you
[53:09] and because he called you he's obligated
[53:12] to keep you
[53:13] because you belong to him he's obligated
[53:16] to protect you
[53:17] because you belong to him he's obligated
[53:20] to fill you
[53:21] because you belong to him he's obligated
[53:24] to move mountains for you to pass up
[53:27] to open red season for you to pass
[53:30] to open the river jordan for you to pass
[53:33] up
[53:33] he's obligated to take two fishes
[53:36] and five loaves up and feed you he's
[53:39] obligated
[53:40] to put you to walk on water he's
[53:43] obligated
[53:44] because you belong to him you belong to
[53:54] god
[53:58] you may be seated
[54:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[54:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[54:07] he's able to take your high blood
[54:10] pressure
[54:11] and bring it to regular blood pressure
[54:13] he's the one who made the whole pressure
[54:14] system
[54:16] he's the one who made the heart he's the
[54:18] one who made the lungs
[54:19] there's no doctor that understands it
[54:21] the way he does
[54:22] there's no physician there's no
[54:24] specialist
[54:26] there's no doctor anywhere in the world
[54:28] who could operate up
[54:30] the way he could operate can't is there
[54:32] anybody in the house this morning
[54:34] who wants to trust a living god who sent
[54:37] a message to
[54:38] call you
[54:45] hallelujah with a random
[54:48] if we could get in one mind and one
[54:50] accord that in
[54:52] five minutes
[54:55] in five minutes there'll be not a sick
[54:58] person in our midst
[54:59] that's what i'm trying to see this
[55:01] morning one mind
[55:03] one accord forget about sin there's no
[55:06] place for sin this morning
[55:08] forget about your passive don't even let
[55:10] your mind go to it
[55:12] god call you he is the one who's gonna
[55:14] finish it
[55:20] you may be seated
[55:23] i still don't know what's happening this
[55:25] morning but for a title put on
[55:28] the whole armor of god for a subject
[55:30] earnestly contended for the fate
[55:32] that was past tense restored by malachi
[55:36] 456
[55:38] inspiration warriors of the fate and i
[55:40] talk about all that i want to follow his
[55:42] message
[55:43] of drive them out because you can drive
[55:45] them out in your own strength
[55:47] you can't drive them out in your own
[55:49] ability you can't drive them up with
[55:51] your idea and your way
[55:53] but the bible says in ephesians
[55:57] finally my brethren after you've
[55:59] listened to everything i've said already
[56:01] paul is saying finally this is the big
[56:03] point
[56:04] everything i said is important but
[56:06] finally i don't want you to forget this
[56:08] thing my brethren
[56:09] be strong in the lord that alone made me
[56:13] feel good
[56:13] because sometimes i don't feel strong in
[56:15] myself i told my wife this morning
[56:18] i said yesterday i felt so sick i said i
[56:20] felt physically down
[56:22] i felt emotionally dumb i fell mentally
[56:25] tom
[56:26] i said the only thing was standing was
[56:28] my testimony
[56:29] i said the only thing i didn't knew was
[56:31] backslide because i felt so low
[56:33] in my body so low in my mind so low
[56:37] emotionally
[56:38] but my testimony was still standing
[56:43] and it's not my testimony it's his
[56:45] testimony
[56:46] because he put the word seed a seed germ
[56:51] a part of himself inside of us
[56:54] to make sure that you are here this
[56:56] morning to make sure
[56:58] that you can worship to make sure that
[57:01] when the word goes forth
[57:03] you hear your name you say that's me you
[57:06] are preaching to me
[57:07] you are talking to me how did the
[57:09] minister know what i was going through
[57:11] it's because the word is your name
[57:22] you may be seated hallelujah
[57:25] hallelujah so we are continuing
[57:29] to drive them out
[57:32] no place for the enemy we are not taking
[57:35] prisoners
[57:36] we are not trying to work a deal out
[57:39] we're not trying to negotiate
[57:41] there's no negotiation there's no
[57:43] compromising
[57:45] there's no let's see what we can work
[57:47] out there's only three words drive
[57:49] them out we are pushing back the attack
[57:52] of the enemy
[57:53] since the prophet left brother branham
[57:56] spoke of all kind of spirits
[57:57] that were operating in his day and
[58:00] operating in his meetings
[58:01] you know the prophet said sometimes he'd
[58:03] love to go by himself
[58:05] because even within the church people
[58:07] would be saying god bless you
[58:09] but he would see the thoughts in their
[58:11] hearts and realize that they were not
[58:13] with him
[58:14] they were saying the words with their
[58:16] mouths but they were not sincere
[58:18] and because he saw that he said he
[58:21] didn't want to see it all
[58:22] the time it was too much for him the
[58:24] hypocrisy was too real
[58:26] the hypocrisy was too troublesome for
[58:28] him so the prophet will pull himself
[58:30] away
[58:31] but there's coming a time when there
[58:33] will be coherence
[58:34] there will be a singularity what your
[58:37] mind and your heart says will be the
[58:38] same thing
[58:39] what your mouth says and what your heart
[58:41] says will be the same thing
[58:43] because nothing will be hidden we are
[58:45] moving into season and time
[58:47] because in the book of acts they thought
[58:49] it was peter
[58:50] that they were talking to but when peter
[58:53] heard
[58:53] what ananias said he said you didn't lie
[58:56] to me
[58:57] you lie to the holy ghost because the
[58:59] holy ghost already went on the inside
[59:01] and see what's going on so we are in
[59:03] another ephesians
[59:05] we are going to have a super church
[59:07] we're going to have a church without sin
[59:09] we're going to have a church where you
[59:11] could have made a mistake
[59:12] but before you even sit down you run to
[59:14] the ella and say pray for me
[59:16] because the holy ghost will be so real
[59:18] it'll call the sin of the church
[59:21] we're gonna have a perfect church up
[59:23] we're gonna have an ephesus
[59:24] church we're gonna have another
[59:26] ephesians we
[59:27] will have a church up that brother
[59:29] branham preached upon
[59:31] i don't care if it's five people if it's
[59:33] 10
[59:34] people if it's 20 people the numbers
[59:37] are not important to call because one
[59:40] will put the thousands of flights up
[59:42] two will put ten thousand to flight
[59:45] three
[59:45] will put a hundred thousand to flight
[59:48] brother
[59:48] i just need a few more people to shake
[59:51] this island
[59:52] to shape this country to shake this
[59:58] world
[1:00:01] you may be seated hallelujah
[1:00:05] give me liberty or give me death
[1:00:09] i want liberty i want reality
[1:00:12] i must be free to come to the house of
[1:00:14] god and worship
[1:00:16] it cannot be that i leave church on
[1:00:18] sunday
[1:00:19] and between sundays by thursday i've
[1:00:22] lost the victory
[1:00:23] by friday i'm not feeling myself there
[1:00:25] must be a time
[1:00:26] when there's a permanence of character
[1:00:29] and there's a permanence of state
[1:00:31] there must come a time when you are so
[1:00:33] solid in christ
[1:00:35] as the bible said he had overcome it
[1:00:37] will i make a pillar in the tabernacle
[1:00:40] and he will go no more out there's
[1:00:42] coming a time
[1:00:43] when you've overcome and you have
[1:00:45] overcome and then you become like a
[1:00:46] rocker
[1:00:47] the wind blows you don't move the storms
[1:00:50] come you don't move
[1:00:51] the bible says you're a pillar in the
[1:00:53] tabernacle
[1:00:55] pillar in the house unmovable unshakable
[1:00:59] nothing can move you because you've been
[1:01:01] grounded and established
[1:01:03] by word and by experience by revelation
[1:01:06] and power
[1:01:07] by blood and fire god help us this
[1:01:10] morning
[1:01:11] to make a church that would make a
[1:01:13] revival
[1:01:14] that people will fly in to see the seven
[1:01:17] thunderstorms
[1:01:18] is being made manifested i'm counting
[1:01:21] down to the day
[1:01:22] when the cripples were walking here we
[1:01:24] won't even have to pray for them
[1:01:26] but the anointing will be all over the
[1:01:28] building
[1:01:29] the place milky white and the fade
[1:01:32] plants so
[1:01:33] high that as the word goes forth people
[1:01:36] catch faith
[1:01:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:46] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:01:49] called to do anything caleb i haven't
[1:01:52] seen you in a while
[1:01:53] but it just takes five minutes in the
[1:01:56] presence of god
[1:01:57] to turn over 40 years from moses for 40
[1:02:00] years moses had lost his way
[1:02:02] for 40 years moses was just there
[1:02:06] he knew the word but he had no burden
[1:02:09] he was not convinced he was not
[1:02:11] concerned
[1:02:12] he knew there was something about his
[1:02:14] life but he needed an
[1:02:15] encounter he needed an encounter with
[1:02:18] something bigger than himself
[1:02:20] bigger than what his wife could say to
[1:02:22] him bigger than what his neighbor could
[1:02:24] say
[1:02:25] bigger than what the pastor could say
[1:02:27] and when he saw the burning bush
[1:02:29] the burning bush the only purpose you
[1:02:32] maybe
[1:02:33] seen it that the burning perceived was
[1:02:35] to attract his attention
[1:02:37] and god does many things to attract or
[1:02:40] interrupt you
[1:02:42] to get your attention and he doesn't
[1:02:44] need your attention for longer
[1:02:46] he just needs five minutes he doesn't
[1:02:48] need it for 82 hours
[1:02:50] to convince you because his power
[1:02:52] connects to the seed in you
[1:02:54] because there's a deep call into the
[1:02:56] deep up there's a deep to respond
[1:02:59] so even in moses blackstone condition
[1:03:02] there was something he was yearning for
[1:03:04] there was something he was looking for
[1:03:06] that's why when he saw the fire
[1:03:08] he said i will turn aside
[1:03:11] i will go up because i'm looking for
[1:03:14] something
[1:03:15] i don't know what i'm looking for but
[1:03:17] there's a thirst in my soul
[1:03:19] there's a need
[1:03:25] you may be seated and the only reason
[1:03:28] you could be in the house of god this
[1:03:30] morning it's because there's a thirst
[1:03:32] there is a need there is a desire
[1:03:35] there's something in you that's calling
[1:03:37] for something
[1:03:38] there's something in you that's needing
[1:03:40] something and we try to fill it
[1:03:42] with all kinds of stuff and the devil is
[1:03:45] good
[1:03:46] he is very good at trying to fill us
[1:03:49] up with all kinds of stuff
[1:04:00] god help us this morning
[1:04:04] but the reason you are here this morning
[1:04:06] is because no matter what the stuff is
[1:04:08] you have tried
[1:04:10] and how you spend your time you will
[1:04:13] never go to bed at night satisfied
[1:04:16] because god put the thirst in there
[1:04:20] and the music and books and positive
[1:04:23] self-talk and positive affirmation
[1:04:26] and saying i'm a believer even saying
[1:04:29] i'm in the message
[1:04:31] still doesn't quench the fist because
[1:04:33] the message
[1:04:35] coming to church the routine and the
[1:04:37] ritual
[1:04:38] that's all up here people program
[1:04:41] themselves
[1:04:42] to wake up on a sunday morning to come
[1:04:44] to church people program themselves
[1:04:47] they set an alarm in the morning it's a
[1:04:49] program that they're on
[1:04:50] but god isn't about programs he's not
[1:04:53] about routines and
[1:04:54] he's about rich world he's not about
[1:04:56] customs
[1:04:57] he's about whatever he wants to do his
[1:05:00] sovereignty
[1:05:01] could meet you on the road to damascus
[1:05:04] his sovereignty
[1:05:05] paul is on the road saw to do damage
[1:05:08] and god could interrupt him on a horse
[1:05:10] god could be mostly with a fire ambush
[1:05:13] god can meet elijah in the rustle of the
[1:05:15] mumberry tree
[1:05:16] god can meet you anywhere you could be
[1:05:19] driving down the road
[1:05:20] you could be on your job but you've got
[1:05:22] to be listening
[1:05:23] you've got to be looking for him you've
[1:05:25] got to be wanting him
[1:05:27] and you've got to recognize that he's
[1:05:29] the one that you are missing
[1:05:39] i pray this help somebody
[1:05:43] this morning
[1:05:47] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:05:50] lord
[1:05:51] and in the power of his might
[1:05:54] his might put on the whole armor of god
[1:05:58] so it's no good to put on part
[1:06:02] of the armor and before you could even
[1:06:04] put on the armor
[1:06:06] you have to take off whatever you're
[1:06:07] wearing
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:17] before you could put on his armor you
[1:06:20] have to take off what you are wearing
[1:06:22] amen amen
[1:06:26] there's the same naked in the world
[1:06:27] become a naked we do not leave
[1:06:30] and what you wear is your character
[1:06:33] what you wear is your bias your
[1:06:37] your feelings your way of doing things
[1:06:40] your way of
[1:06:41] resolving conflict your own perspectives
[1:06:45] your
[1:06:46] your history some of us will wear this
[1:06:50] i've done it this way for five years
[1:06:53] i don't talk to people i don't i don't
[1:06:55] like to talk to people i don't and
[1:06:57] that's what we're wearing
[1:07:00] you can't tell god i would like to talk
[1:07:02] to people because when god told peter go
[1:07:05] and talk to this one he couldn't say
[1:07:06] i like to talk to
[1:07:09] people so whatever you are wearing
[1:07:14] you have got to take it off to put on
[1:07:17] his armor
[1:07:25] put on the whole hour of god that we may
[1:07:27] be able to stand against the wiles
[1:07:30] of the devil the tactics of the devil
[1:07:34] the recommendations of the devil the
[1:07:36] bible says we are not ignorant of
[1:07:38] satan's devices
[1:07:40] devices we're not ignorant of his
[1:07:43] attacks in his plans and his strategy
[1:07:45] and he's very good and the bible goes on
[1:07:46] before we wrestle not against
[1:07:48] flesh and blood but against
[1:07:51] principalities against powers
[1:07:53] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:07:55] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:07:58] in high places and i share this in
[1:08:01] nigeria i heard another preacher speak
[1:08:03] about it and he said
[1:08:04] nowhere from genesis to revelation do
[1:08:07] you find demons arguing with one another
[1:08:15] in fact when jesus was on the earth and
[1:08:17] he was
[1:08:18] healing the sick and doing miracles
[1:08:21] those ignorant pharisees and the people
[1:08:23] said it's by the power of blg bob that
[1:08:25] jesus is doing this
[1:08:28] and jesus said listen a house divided
[1:08:31] will never stop in other words the devil
[1:08:33] is smarter
[1:08:35] than allowing division in his own
[1:08:37] kingdom so his soldiers marched together
[1:08:40] so when jesus met the man with legion he
[1:08:42] asked who you are they say legion
[1:08:44] they're working in harmony multiple
[1:08:45] spirits
[1:08:46] but remember when you cast out one demon
[1:08:49] he goes to get back up
[1:08:51] come back with seven more that if you
[1:08:53] don't clean up the house he's gonna come
[1:08:54] back with more strength
[1:08:56] because he knew it took a power to clean
[1:08:57] him out what about the church of the
[1:08:59] living god
[1:09:02] we cannot be divided we cannot be
[1:09:05] separated
[1:09:06] it cannot be husband against wife and
[1:09:08] father against son
[1:09:10] and church against church and pastor
[1:09:12] against pastor
[1:09:13] we have got to stand united as one army
[1:09:17] because the enemy is united as one army
[1:09:20] but if we stand shoulder to shoulder
[1:09:23] that's why with the problem said the
[1:09:24] fight for ministry
[1:09:25] will have each one backing one another
[1:09:28] up
[1:09:28] because we need each other it's our
[1:09:31] enemy he's gonna come from every side
[1:09:33] but if we put shoulder to shoulder and
[1:09:36] back to back
[1:09:36] the devil is finished can the church say
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] oh hallelujah
[1:09:45] what are you doing preacher we're gonna
[1:09:47] expose the devil
[1:09:49] at every one of his tricks we're gonna
[1:09:52] expose him because listen
[1:09:54] the devil could only operate if he is
[1:09:57] hidden
[1:10:01] but if you expose him he has to find
[1:10:03] somewhere else to go
[1:10:08] anybody with me this morning once he is
[1:10:12] hidden
[1:10:12] he could operate but the moment we shine
[1:10:15] light and open the cover and lift up the
[1:10:17] bed and find our way here and expose him
[1:10:20] he cannot stay exposed
[1:10:24] he has to go and find somewhere else to
[1:10:26] hide that's why when jesus came to that
[1:10:29] man who they call legion
[1:10:31] and he got exposed he said listen send
[1:10:33] me somewhere send me to the pigs
[1:10:36] because he can't stay there no more he
[1:10:38] has been exposed
[1:10:39] he has been identified and we're gonna
[1:10:42] shine light
[1:10:42] in every room of your house because once
[1:10:45] a light goes on the devil can hide no
[1:10:48] more
[1:10:48] and he has got to get out and want to
[1:10:51] never get out
[1:10:52] once that snake gets out there's no room
[1:10:55] for the holy ghost to fill every house
[1:10:57] to fill every room
[1:10:59] because fear and doubt cannot live in
[1:11:01] the same house of
[1:11:02] unbelief and faith cannot live in the
[1:11:04] same house
[1:11:06] light and darkness cannot live in the
[1:11:08] same house
[1:11:16] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:20] everybody feeling fine i'm just waiting
[1:11:23] on him this morning i have different
[1:11:24] notes but
[1:11:25] he's saying some things this morning to
[1:11:27] help you
[1:11:29] today it's exactly two months away from
[1:11:31] our convention
[1:11:35] and we have a responsibility we have a
[1:11:39] responsibility
[1:11:40] to be prayed up we have a responsibility
[1:11:43] to be under expectation
[1:11:45] we have a responsibility to fast and
[1:11:47] call upon god
[1:11:48] because there's no shortcut there is no
[1:11:52] other way to do it there's only one way
[1:11:55] and that's his way and no revival comes
[1:11:58] without sacrifice
[1:12:00] nothing worth having comes without
[1:12:03] sacrifice
[1:12:04] and when you can appreciate that and
[1:12:06] understand that it changes your
[1:12:08] perspective enough
[1:12:11] it changes your perspective completely
[1:12:14] you want success in the natural
[1:12:16] there is no success without sacrifice
[1:12:23] you can live any life you want but if
[1:12:25] you want
[1:12:26] what people who work hard get there's no
[1:12:28] shortcut to working hard
[1:12:33] they're people who work 18 hours a day
[1:12:35] for five years and when you see them
[1:12:36] it's like he's successful
[1:12:40] until you are ready to do the 18 hour
[1:12:41] days you're not ready yet
[1:12:46] and if people in the natural could do 18
[1:12:48] hour days for a purpose that
[1:12:50] they have in their heart to achieve what
[1:12:52] about the spiritual
[1:12:56] how much praying must we do to have good
[1:12:58] success
[1:12:59] how much meditation must we do to have
[1:13:02] good success
[1:13:03] how much talking to god must we do
[1:13:06] to get him to operate on our behalf and
[1:13:09] to move things on our behalf
[1:13:12] because whenever you get into his
[1:13:13] business he starts to take care of your
[1:13:16] business
[1:13:22] my god from a message of total
[1:13:25] deliverance
[1:13:28] then just like you if you are a
[1:13:30] christian
[1:13:31] god don't make any halfway christians
[1:13:35] god makes complete christians god don't
[1:13:38] make
[1:13:38] halfway preachers but the preacher can
[1:13:41] be halfway
[1:13:42] and god makes his children christians
[1:13:46] but sometimes they're halfway christians
[1:13:49] it's not god's intention for them to be
[1:13:51] that way it's their
[1:13:52] own ways god mixed up with the plan of
[1:13:55] god for their life
[1:13:56] and that's what makes them the way they
[1:13:58] are god don't want to be halfway
[1:14:01] christian or halfway preachers
[1:14:02] compromising on either side so that
[1:14:05] compromising that giving back room for
[1:14:08] the devil to operate that's what we are
[1:14:09] going
[1:14:10] at this morning to drive them out
[1:14:13] completely
[1:14:26] so brother proclaimed a message let me
[1:14:29] just touch my text a little bit
[1:14:30] and see what god will do for the next
[1:14:32] few minutes proclaim the message of
[1:14:34] shout message to call the bride
[1:14:36] to war this message was the places in
[1:14:39] another ephesians and i connected to
[1:14:41] another ephesians
[1:14:42] because brother stephen preached a
[1:14:44] masterpiece i believe two sundays ago
[1:14:46] about possessing your
[1:14:48] inheritance and brother already followed
[1:14:50] it would drive them out
[1:14:52] placing us in joshua and we know from
[1:14:54] the word that joshua and ephesians are
[1:14:56] parallels of each other
[1:14:58] so i wanted to pick it up from the
[1:14:59] ephesian side so this message that
[1:15:01] brother branham brought
[1:15:03] was the places in another ephesians or
[1:15:05] said another way to place us
[1:15:07] into the land of the inheritance the
[1:15:09] land of promise the holy ghost land
[1:15:11] and divide the inheritance to us because
[1:15:14] each of us have our own inheritance
[1:15:17] each of us have our own place each of us
[1:15:19] have our own position
[1:15:21] and it's only in your place or your
[1:15:23] position you could properly defend
[1:15:25] yourself
[1:15:26] when you are on your territory you have
[1:15:28] a right to defend yourself
[1:15:30] when you are on your property you have a
[1:15:32] right to protect your family
[1:15:34] when you are on your territory you have
[1:15:36] a right to do what you have to do
[1:15:38] because it's yours
[1:15:39] and this word came to let you know what
[1:15:42] is yours
[1:15:43] this world came to let you know that
[1:15:45] healing is yours this word came to let
[1:15:47] you know that the holy ghost
[1:15:48] is yours and once you know it's yours it
[1:15:51] puts you in a position
[1:15:52] to fight for what is yours you cannot be
[1:15:55] in the club
[1:15:56] and fight for something in the club
[1:15:58] because the club is not yours you can be
[1:16:00] your open worldly music and fight for
[1:16:03] that because that's not yours
[1:16:04] but when you are in the will of god you
[1:16:07] can fight
[1:16:08] recklessly fight because when you are in
[1:16:10] his will
[1:16:11] he is obligated to back you up in his
[1:16:14] will
[1:16:15] brother branham taught us that jesus is
[1:16:19] authority was based on his position
[1:16:22] so when you are in your position the
[1:16:24] position brings within a certain
[1:16:26] authority
[1:16:28] you may see it for a minute the
[1:16:30] authority that comes with position
[1:16:33] has nothing to do with your standing
[1:16:40] the authority that comes with your
[1:16:42] position has nothing to do with your
[1:16:44] standing i'll give you an example
[1:16:46] a police officer could be a corrupt
[1:16:48] police officer
[1:16:50] but when he wears the police officer
[1:16:52] uniform and tells you to stop
[1:16:55] the fact that he is corrupt doesn't take
[1:16:58] away the authority he has
[1:17:00] to tell you to stop because his
[1:17:02] authority
[1:17:03] is based on his position
[1:17:09] the prime minister of the country could
[1:17:10] be crazy
[1:17:13] but that doesn't change the fact because
[1:17:15] he holds the position
[1:17:16] he has the authority to speak an
[1:17:19] action is taken when you are in your
[1:17:22] position
[1:17:23] it comes with an authority now what the
[1:17:26] devil wants to do is attack your
[1:17:28] standing
[1:17:30] he wants to tell the police officer you
[1:17:32] made a mistake yesterday
[1:17:34] so forget the uniform forget the backup
[1:17:37] because a police officer could pick up
[1:17:39] his radio and say backup
[1:17:40] wanted but the devil says don't touch
[1:17:43] the radio
[1:17:45] forget your uniform because you made a
[1:17:47] mistake last week
[1:17:49] you made a mistake yesterday don't look
[1:17:52] in the mirror because if you look in the
[1:17:54] mirror you will see you have on the
[1:17:55] uniform
[1:17:57] don't look in the mirror because you
[1:17:58] will see you resemble
[1:18:00] the rest of people who make things
[1:18:03] happen
[1:18:04] that's what the devil does but if you
[1:18:06] look in the mirror of the world
[1:18:08] you could see that maybe you're not
[1:18:09] where you're supposed to be but your
[1:18:12] boots are polished
[1:18:15] you have a gun on your side there's a
[1:18:18] radio for backup
[1:18:20] you might be tired but don't let the
[1:18:23] devil
[1:18:24] see you make the mistake of touch the
[1:18:26] radio
[1:18:27] and sometimes it's better to pick up the
[1:18:29] radio than to touch the gun
[1:18:32] because with a gun you could take on one
[1:18:34] maybe two but three but with the radio
[1:18:37] jesus said i can call legions to support
[1:18:43] if i want armies i can call for them but
[1:18:49] you maybe see them what are you saying
[1:18:52] by the isaac
[1:18:54] there's some wounded eagles in here this
[1:18:56] morning but being wounded
[1:18:58] has not taken off your uniform you may
[1:19:01] be wounded this morning
[1:19:03] but that being wounded because battle
[1:19:06] has you scarred sometimes
[1:19:08] you get shot in this arm and this arm
[1:19:10] don't want to walk sometimes
[1:19:11] that's called righteous by the way but
[1:19:13] that's the enemy's job
[1:19:15] to send a bullet your way
[1:19:18] but your uniform is still on maybe you
[1:19:21] lost a helmet
[1:19:22] maybe you put this morning put black on
[1:19:24] the whole armor of god
[1:19:26] so you could stand against every attack
[1:19:28] of the enemy
[1:19:32] you may be seated and the bible said
[1:19:36] i haven't done all but a clearance stand
[1:19:38] stand
[1:19:41] haven't done all after you've done all
[1:19:44] you can still stand
[1:19:46] when you've tied you know what to say
[1:19:47] when you're at the end of the rope you
[1:19:49] ever said that
[1:19:50] when you're the end of the rope tie your
[1:19:51] knot and hang on
[1:19:56] when at the end of the rope tie a knot
[1:19:58] and hang on after you have done
[1:20:00] that still stand
[1:20:03] after you have explored a knock and
[1:20:05] every door still stand
[1:20:07] diversity haven't done all to stand
[1:20:09] stand
[1:20:10] you know why because backup is on its
[1:20:12] way
[1:20:14] you know how many wars people didn't
[1:20:16] think were going to be one
[1:20:18] and they say hold the line hold the line
[1:20:20] there's only three of us remaining
[1:20:21] it's a thousand hold the line back up
[1:20:24] it's on the way somebody's saying man
[1:20:32] i pray that this helps somebody this
[1:20:34] morning
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:36] but every day you are in the word
[1:20:40] and the word becomes more real to you it
[1:20:42] brings clarity to your position
[1:20:45] it brings clarity to your purpose it
[1:20:48] brings
[1:20:49] clarity to what you wake up in the
[1:20:50] morning to do
[1:20:52] because when you have purpose and
[1:20:53] clarity it focuses your actions
[1:20:56] when you don't know what you are
[1:20:57] supposed to do you do 82 things that are
[1:20:59] not important
[1:21:00] an activity doesn't mean you're doing
[1:21:02] something that's relevant
[1:21:04] don't even let me go there there are
[1:21:06] people in jobs doing a lot of stuff
[1:21:09] that's not relevant
[1:21:13] just activity put the paper from here to
[1:21:15] here then move from here to here put it
[1:21:17] from here to here
[1:21:19] here to here anything here anything here
[1:21:22] how was work did they work was good i
[1:21:23] did a lot of stuff
[1:21:26] activity not relevant how does it
[1:21:28] contribute to the profits i don't know
[1:21:31] does it add revenue i don't know what
[1:21:34] are you doing for the
[1:21:35] put it from here to here but from here
[1:21:37] to here why because my boss told me put
[1:21:39] it from here to here when i'm done put
[1:21:40] it from here to here
[1:21:45] so we just don't want activity
[1:21:48] we wonder when we walk we're walking
[1:21:50] with direction and purpose
[1:21:54] that's when you pray you're not praying
[1:21:56] rambling
[1:21:57] you're praying with purpose because
[1:22:00] you're praying with revelation of what
[1:22:02] to ask for
[1:22:05] so the way god taught us to pray say you
[1:22:07] pray for us
[1:22:08] our father who art in heaven first you
[1:22:10] stop with worship
[1:22:12] hallowed be thy name it's a structure
[1:22:16] god give you the formula for success our
[1:22:18] father
[1:22:19] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:22:22] thy will be done you haven't asked for
[1:22:25] anything just yet
[1:22:26] you are giving him worship honor glory
[1:22:28] acknowledging the authority you're
[1:22:30] talking to
[1:22:31] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[1:22:34] earth
[1:22:34] as it is in heaven when you establish
[1:22:38] his authority and then he said oh give
[1:22:39] us this deal with daily bread
[1:22:42] and you begin to get into your request
[1:22:44] but when you when you approach it
[1:22:46] in a balanced workforce approach to god
[1:22:49] it can be your way it must be his way
[1:22:52] when you approach it right
[1:22:54] then you could get into a spirit of the
[1:22:57] lord's day the spirit of this day and
[1:22:59] ask what you need
[1:23:01] request what you need and see god make
[1:23:03] it happen because your approach is right
[1:23:05] amateurs say amen is this helping
[1:23:07] anybody this morning
[1:23:12] and god is more concerned about your
[1:23:14] attitude than your actions
[1:23:21] i'll say it again god is more concerned
[1:23:23] about your attitude
[1:23:25] than your action are you willing
[1:23:30] you're doing it but you're not doing it
[1:23:31] willingly
[1:23:33] asked you to help them you help them but
[1:23:35] you help them grudgingly
[1:23:37] you really want to help them know but
[1:23:38] you help them because
[1:23:40] they know you're a christian and they
[1:23:42] ask you and you're supposed to have a
[1:23:43] testimony i really want to give it
[1:24:00] vex so as far as you can say
[1:24:04] nobody could pin and say he doesn't go
[1:24:06] the extra mile you know
[1:24:08] but god is saying you see the way his
[1:24:10] approach
[1:24:11] his attitude that's
[1:24:14] why the bible speaks about david's men
[1:24:17] his least desire was their command
[1:24:20] it was the way they approached they had
[1:24:22] so much respect for the man of god
[1:24:24] that when he nodded they were ready to
[1:24:26] move his leases that was a command to
[1:24:29] them
[1:24:29] and they did it willingly so when he
[1:24:31] wanted a drink of water they
[1:24:33] cut through the philistines because i
[1:24:35] know he wanted a drink of water
[1:24:36] and when david saw how willing they were
[1:24:39] he said he couldn't even drink the water
[1:24:40] he poured it as a sacrifice to the lord
[1:24:43] because
[1:24:44] the attitude of his men
[1:24:48] so how must our attitude be to the
[1:24:50] kingdom
[1:24:51] and to the things of god it's a marvel
[1:24:54] to me
[1:24:54] because we're talking about warfare i'm
[1:24:57] talking about
[1:24:58] warfare means you're talking about being
[1:24:59] in the army of the lord
[1:25:01] and anybody who has exposure with the
[1:25:03] credit force or army or military
[1:25:05] there are a lot of rules and standards
[1:25:08] and regulations
[1:25:10] and there's a lot of training because
[1:25:11] there are people you know the people who
[1:25:13] are in the army who never went to war
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:19] and watch now they can march enough
[1:25:28] they could salute they could do organic
[1:25:30] but they never went to war
[1:25:34] but in the army they're focused on the
[1:25:36] training
[1:25:37] because you never know when you're
[1:25:38] called into action
[1:25:40] but the difference with us is we are in
[1:25:42] a war
[1:25:44] so there's no match match match after
[1:25:46] one you're trained you're giving a gun
[1:25:48] on your center to go and fight
[1:25:50] just go and fight fight kill something
[1:25:56] kill or be killed that's right it's
[1:25:58] either you let that diabetes get you or
[1:26:00] you get it
[1:26:00] yeah yeah it's your choice
[1:26:04] people say is it my diary cheese and
[1:26:07] opinion either you claim it or you push
[1:26:08] it back
[1:26:10] this morning i'm sending it back
[1:26:14] every morning you gotta say diabetes
[1:26:16] you're finished
[1:26:18] i'd write this you're finished can't say
[1:26:20] you're finished
[1:26:23] every day you have the diabetes on the
[1:26:26] ropes
[1:26:26] you have people on on the ropes you put
[1:26:29] it on the ropes
[1:26:30] you're letting go as the day goes on
[1:26:32] this headache has got to go
[1:26:34] by striped i am healed what is that
[1:26:36] that's warfare
[1:26:39] that's warfare you maybe see that so you
[1:26:42] mean
[1:26:43] you me to tell me there are sick people
[1:26:45] in here who don't put pressure on your
[1:26:48] sickness
[1:26:50] really that's what wolfie is
[1:26:54] you are cheering it back sitting and you
[1:26:55] don't claim them every day
[1:26:58] you're not serious you don't really want
[1:26:59] him to come back but warfare means the
[1:27:02] devil must know you serious
[1:27:05] every day every single day
[1:27:08] lord i clear my children today satan
[1:27:11] take your hands of my children
[1:27:16] every day but when you are convinced and
[1:27:20] concerned
[1:27:21] it becomes easy to pray because you know
[1:27:24] what you're praying for
[1:27:27] but then i'm taught that they take
[1:27:29] adopted son to drive with the
[1:27:30] philistines so after you deal with the
[1:27:32] hittites they have a rising ammo right
[1:27:33] the jebusites the king of sites
[1:27:37] are you ready for philistines you say
[1:27:39] lord i need this adoption
[1:27:41] father you have to adopt me whatever it
[1:27:44] takes
[1:27:44] i need to make it guide me to data
[1:27:47] adoption
[1:27:48] today today every day like that so you
[1:27:51] want to get the philistines too
[1:27:53] you want to drive them out too
[1:27:55] somebody's amen
[1:27:59] you may be seated so that's how you
[1:28:02] declare war on the enemy
[1:28:04] you declare war in your house every day
[1:28:07] every day
[1:28:08] say lord i claim my prayer life lord
[1:28:10] give me a burden for prayer
[1:28:12] lord give me a burden for praise you in
[1:28:14] a maxi you're waiting on a taxi
[1:28:16] but you decline on you declaring war the
[1:28:18] devil don't even have room to enter your
[1:28:20] mind
[1:28:20] because you're always on the offensive
[1:28:22] there's no need to defend anymore
[1:28:24] because you just push them you're just
[1:28:25] throwing grenades he destroyed bombs
[1:28:28] he won the attack every time the devil
[1:28:30] sees you saying that there has to be an
[1:28:32] easier target
[1:28:33] there has to be somebody easier because
[1:28:34] but the church is always on the attack
[1:28:37] but it's always on the attack that's how
[1:28:39] we must be
[1:28:40] put on the whole armor of god and drive
[1:28:43] them out
[1:28:52] i pray this helps somebody in here
[1:28:55] because i know many people here
[1:28:58] apply the token and people don't know
[1:29:00] what to do
[1:29:11] but you know what the prophet said he
[1:29:13] said when you apply the token you take
[1:29:14] the word to yourself
[1:29:16] you believe every word you act upon
[1:29:18] every word
[1:29:19] you claim every word and when you do
[1:29:22] that
[1:29:22] then the devil knows you mean business
[1:29:24] and god also knows
[1:29:26] that you mean business so as a church
[1:29:29] can we pledge
[1:29:30] to be on the offensive from this day is
[1:29:33] there anybody here this morning
[1:29:35] from this day on you would be on the
[1:29:37] offensive from this day on you'll be in
[1:29:40] prayer
[1:29:41] from this day on you'll be in worship
[1:29:43] and commitment and dedication because
[1:29:45] that's what it takes to see results in
[1:29:48] your home in your life in the church
[1:29:50] on your job you see doors open up for
[1:29:53] you you don't even expect to open up
[1:29:55] because you're anointing all over you
[1:29:58] all around you
[1:29:59] jesus himself had to pray
[1:30:02] to keep in that atmosphere because
[1:30:05] prayer keeps you in an atmosphere
[1:30:07] it's impossible i said it some weeks ago
[1:30:10] it's impossible to get there from
[1:30:11] praying and go and argue with your wife
[1:30:15] that is too big of a leap it's too big
[1:30:17] it has a way off
[1:30:22] it's impossible to go from prayer to go
[1:30:24] and argue with your boss
[1:30:26] but when you're in that anointing then
[1:30:28] you see things differently
[1:30:30] you reckon the battle not against flesh
[1:30:32] and blood
[1:30:33] it's not you and the deacon and the
[1:30:34] usher and the wife in the hospital but
[1:30:36] it's principalities and powers
[1:30:38] and it's a it's it's a spiritual warfare
[1:30:40] that you are in
[1:30:41] and you have a destination because all
[1:30:43] of this is temporary
[1:30:46] why fight and spend energy on the
[1:30:48] temporary stuff
[1:30:49] when there's an eternity to go to with a
[1:30:51] land that's made of gold with a fountain
[1:30:54] that he could drink any time it's a body
[1:30:56] that doesn't get
[1:30:57] sick that's what we ought to fight for
[1:30:59] that's what i want to fight for
[1:31:01] can the church say man could you take
[1:31:04] some more
[1:31:06] my my i haven't gotten anywhere
[1:31:09] with this thought this morning i have
[1:31:11] four sections and i'm on page six of the
[1:31:14] first section
[1:31:17] my my my my my my mind
[1:31:21] so malachi for came to restore the heart
[1:31:23] of the children back to the faith
[1:31:25] of the apostolic fathers and we are
[1:31:28] contending for one lord
[1:31:30] one feet one baptism to meet the
[1:31:34] challenge of the hour
[1:31:35] because every hour has its own challenge
[1:31:39] noah had his challenge in his day moses
[1:31:42] had the challenge in his day
[1:31:44] joseph had the challenge in his day our
[1:31:46] day not
[1:31:47] only has his power and his messenger and
[1:31:49] his message
[1:31:50] but there are challenges that we have in
[1:31:52] our day
[1:31:54] and you have to be able to meet the
[1:31:56] challenge not with your own strength
[1:31:58] but by the whole armor of god um taught
[1:32:01] us the whole armor of god is what he
[1:32:02] said is a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:05] that's the whole armor of god so we are
[1:32:07] here to apply because brethren
[1:32:08] taught us full obedience to the entire
[1:32:11] word of god
[1:32:12] entitles you to the token which is the
[1:32:15] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:17] which is the full armor of god which is
[1:32:19] the power of god i'm not talking about
[1:32:21] the birth now i'm not talking about the
[1:32:22] pentecostal experience but i'm talking
[1:32:24] about the fullness of god himself
[1:32:26] that when they see you they say that's
[1:32:27] christ that she's that the same god
[1:32:30] that pushed back to the devil when he
[1:32:33] was here
[1:32:34] can the church say amen so this message
[1:32:37] this morning is an encouragement
[1:32:39] to you that are in the battle but maybe
[1:32:41] you're tired maybe
[1:32:43] you're thinking about giving up maybe
[1:32:44] you get discouraged but you're in the
[1:32:46] battle
[1:32:47] you don't understand why this happened
[1:32:49] you don't understand why that happened
[1:32:50] you don't understand
[1:32:51] why this went wrong you don't understand
[1:32:53] why they are teased at their updates and
[1:32:54] they're down there
[1:32:55] and you've seen so much something you
[1:32:58] don't even know why you're in the fight
[1:33:00] but we are fighting anyhow we are
[1:33:03] fighting for our inheritance
[1:33:05] we are fighting for our promise we are
[1:33:07] fighting for our purpose
[1:33:08] we are fighting the bible said it is a
[1:33:10] time for war and a time for peace
[1:33:13] we are not talking about peace this
[1:33:15] morning we're talking about war
[1:33:17] because many of us we have been at peace
[1:33:18] with the devil for a long time
[1:33:20] we have allowed the devil to do what he
[1:33:21] wants to do in our houses in our lives
[1:33:23] and our marriages
[1:33:24] and in the church but in this day the
[1:33:27] seventh
[1:33:27] of this month the seventh of may we
[1:33:30] declare war
[1:33:31] against the enemy we are letting the
[1:33:33] devil know that we are taking back our
[1:33:35] prayer we are taking back our worship
[1:33:37] we are taking back a revival we are
[1:33:40] taking back our position
[1:33:41] we are claiming our inheritance we will
[1:33:44] have a church
[1:33:45] without spot without wrinkle we will
[1:33:47] have a manifestation
[1:33:49] of every promise lay down my malachi 4
[1:33:52] can the church say amen
[1:33:56] amen just a few more minutes
[1:34:00] and i'll close out in the message
[1:34:03] putting on the whole armor of god with
[1:34:04] the balance
[1:34:04] and you know in this warfare between
[1:34:06] nations there's a great warfare going on
[1:34:09] and that's the warfare between god and
[1:34:11] satan and great warfare
[1:34:12] it was the first warfare and it's still
[1:34:14] raging but oh i'm so glad
[1:34:16] it'll soon come to an end then let's all
[1:34:18] be over
[1:34:19] satan has his agents out everywhere
[1:34:21] watching spying out on god's people
[1:34:24] god moves the enemy is sitting
[1:34:27] everywhere
[1:34:28] watching to see what he can do but go
[1:34:30] and god's got some out too
[1:34:32] so we find out that these secret agents
[1:34:34] of the enemy that sits around this is
[1:34:36] the prophet speaking
[1:34:37] each nation now he brings a parallel
[1:34:40] will equip
[1:34:41] its men with the latest equipment the
[1:34:42] very latest and they study and they do
[1:34:45] everything they're trying to counteract
[1:34:46] the other fellows weapons and
[1:34:48] get a little more modern weapon a little
[1:34:50] something with a little more punch to it
[1:34:51] and
[1:34:52] if you're watching the world news
[1:34:53] there's private wars rules of wars it's
[1:34:56] one minute it's not curious say
[1:34:57] if america does this they will do this
[1:34:59] and america sends a ship
[1:35:00] and many we have a small island far away
[1:35:03] it doesn't affect us but if you over
[1:35:04] there you see the big ship coming what
[1:35:05] do you think you're going to do
[1:35:08] and north korea say they have the thing
[1:35:10] is russia say they have the mother of
[1:35:12] all bombs who say well who's there the
[1:35:13] father of all bombs and
[1:35:15] it's a competition and stuff that humans
[1:35:17] can't even understand because one of
[1:35:18] these bombs will destroy millions
[1:35:19] of people that's what the problem is
[1:35:21] talking about here right they're trying
[1:35:22] to counteract the other fellows weapons
[1:35:24] they get a little more modern weapon a
[1:35:26] little something with a little more
[1:35:27] punch that's a lot
[1:35:28] more punch from the bow and arrow to a
[1:35:32] musketeer from a musketeer modern rifle
[1:35:33] and from that to an atomic they just
[1:35:35] keep building
[1:35:36] and it keeps them busy all the time busy
[1:35:39] all the time
[1:35:43] and it's the nation's business if they
[1:35:45] want to survive they want to equip their
[1:35:48] soldiers with the best equipment that
[1:35:49] there is
[1:35:51] but abraham said well god you know he's
[1:35:53] infinite see
[1:35:54] he don't have to think anything better
[1:35:56] he just got the best to begin with
[1:35:59] so man went from gun to bow and arrow
[1:36:02] sword
[1:36:02] gun cannon dignity he said but god
[1:36:06] give the best at the beginning he
[1:36:09] actually gave us nuclear weapons
[1:36:11] he just got the best to begin with so
[1:36:13] you can't improve on that
[1:36:15] nothing to be done about it he just gave
[1:36:17] us the best and that's his word that's
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:20] his word the best that can be given god
[1:36:23] gives his
[1:36:24] people the very best that's what he
[1:36:26] chose with his children
[1:36:27] the very best i'm so glad of that and
[1:36:30] we're glad of them
[1:36:34] now listen here when the brother said
[1:36:36] now god cannot
[1:36:38] make a decision today and tomorrow come
[1:36:40] back and make a better decision
[1:36:43] because his first decision is perfect he
[1:36:45] never has to change it
[1:36:47] so therefore we can rest upon whatever
[1:36:50] god says
[1:36:51] so if god's decision will deceive him is
[1:36:53] perfect to begin with
[1:36:54] it means that when god called you and
[1:36:57] equipped you with the best weapon
[1:36:59] he can't even change his mind about his
[1:37:01] weapon and he can't even change his mind
[1:37:03] about the soldier
[1:37:06] so when god chose you but a caleb he
[1:37:09] didn't make a mistake
[1:37:11] he didn't make a mistake with you young
[1:37:12] people when he called you all to the
[1:37:14] world
[1:37:15] and he put you in the house he put you
[1:37:17] in to give you the opportunity to hear
[1:37:19] this word
[1:37:20] he made the best decision he could have
[1:37:23] ever
[1:37:23] made and because of that you are going
[1:37:26] to make it
[1:37:27] you are going to overcome oh
[1:37:30] my my my
[1:37:36] so this is not the time church for us to
[1:37:39] die
[1:37:43] already you know i i believe in them but
[1:37:45] only go ahead
[1:37:47] leave me here that that that's some of
[1:37:50] us know
[1:37:50] i've been if you join me in a long time
[1:37:52] somebody older caleb listen there's no
[1:37:53] old lucky 11 no
[1:37:54] that gray hair is going to reverse
[1:37:57] i'm not buying that i'm not i'm not
[1:38:00] accepting it
[1:38:01] there's no giving up another law when he
[1:38:02] cares to give up time for the young
[1:38:04] people to take over you are young people
[1:38:05] too
[1:38:07] it's just the process needs to be
[1:38:08] refinished that seed in you makes you a
[1:38:10] young people
[1:38:11] so i'm speaking to the young people and
[1:38:13] the caleb's no giving up that pain has
[1:38:15] got to go
[1:38:17] the joy that that hip and the scope in
[1:38:19] his step has got to come back
[1:38:22] i'm speaking it i'm claiming it
[1:38:25] if this is about the antwerp this is
[1:38:27] imagine when his body changed at 21 year
[1:38:30] old
[1:38:31] you could imagine the kind of
[1:38:33] competition we would have
[1:38:35] you imagine when they got to the land
[1:38:36] and immediately the kind of competition
[1:38:38] they had
[1:38:39] dancing on the land rather that's how
[1:38:41] it's going to be
[1:38:42] we're gonna have a grand time we're
[1:38:44] gonna have a wonderful time
[1:38:46] it's gonna be a jubilee time
[1:38:51] is there anybody in the house this
[1:38:56] morning
[1:39:02] listen it have stress i'd have stress on
[1:39:04] that people
[1:39:05] and that's what i say god really knows
[1:39:07] how much you give everybody
[1:39:11] because i see people with stress and i
[1:39:14] think we're real stressed
[1:39:17] i feel real real stressed
[1:39:20] and when you watch stress and see what
[1:39:21] makes somebody say let's say oh gosh
[1:39:23] you're falling down
[1:39:24] and say the pipeline back in him
[1:39:29] and somebody hold front of the house for
[1:39:30] a long it's like that pipe
[1:39:32] we could patch that up do like all
[1:39:35] frustrated
[1:39:37] but the random picture message why are
[1:39:38] we so tossed about
[1:39:40] so easy to get frustrated you know
[1:39:44] i don't want to call me but some time
[1:39:45] ago i heard some noise
[1:39:49] and it was a lizard
[1:39:58] now the waiting noise came rotary
[1:40:01] i thought it was a serious criticism
[1:40:06] but it's stress and stress
[1:40:11] no if i listen cause that brother
[1:40:13] brother said
[1:40:14] what happened when would i come
[1:40:23] so the reality is the trials and the
[1:40:25] situation in your life
[1:40:27] and that's why god couldn't send goliath
[1:40:29] for david
[1:40:30] up front he had to go through the line
[1:40:33] and the beer
[1:40:34] so based on his experience now dealing
[1:40:38] with these two elements
[1:40:39] he now had a resume to present a king
[1:40:44] soul
[1:40:44] saying based on my job experience and my
[1:40:48] qualifications
[1:40:49] i am the only man who could apply for
[1:40:51] this job
[1:40:54] and he was in fact the only applicant
[1:40:57] so when saul received his resume he said
[1:41:00] listen
[1:41:01] this job has benefits you get my
[1:41:04] daughter
[1:41:04] you get you see
[1:41:08] and david there with the qualifications
[1:41:11] he now feel encouraged
[1:41:13] because there's no doubt in his mind he
[1:41:15] walked there with a sling
[1:41:17] and with a little stick container and
[1:41:19] say listen i will feed you i'll chop
[1:41:20] your head off
[1:41:21] his experience and confidence in the god
[1:41:24] that delivered him
[1:41:26] was bigger than what he had in his hands
[1:41:28] his
[1:41:29] confidence in god was bigger than what
[1:41:31] his eyes could see
[1:41:32] or even the eyes of the hr practitioners
[1:41:35] who were reviewing his performance
[1:41:38] can the church say man but when he
[1:41:40] chopped the head off
[1:41:42] after israel paused to see if god was
[1:41:45] really dead
[1:41:46] then they started shouting and they
[1:41:48] started rejoicing
[1:41:49] because they recognized that goliath was
[1:41:51] finished
[1:41:53] so your trials and your testings and
[1:41:56] your lizards and your lions and your
[1:41:58] bears
[1:41:59] are all to prepare you for your own
[1:42:01] experience with goliath
[1:42:03] because we all have our goliath to deal
[1:42:07] with
[1:42:07] but as the pastor always says for every
[1:42:10] goliath
[1:42:11] there is a stone with his name on it
[1:42:15] and our responsibility is to collect
[1:42:19] goliath's head with the stone that has
[1:42:22] his name on it
[1:42:23] that's what overcomers do overcomers
[1:42:26] find stones
[1:42:27] to match against goliaths so they could
[1:42:30] be a goliath in your life right now
[1:42:32] what we are trying to do this morning is
[1:42:34] to find all the stones
[1:42:36] for every goliath because every goliath
[1:42:39] will be destroyed
[1:42:41] because david's ministry is on the earth
[1:42:44] but abraham's message was to bring us
[1:42:47] back
[1:42:47] to david's ministry which is not the
[1:42:49] ministry of man
[1:42:50] but brother branham said that david is
[1:42:53] christ
[1:42:54] and christ being in his bride is david's
[1:42:56] ministry
[1:42:57] can the church stay man
[1:43:04] the musicians are getting ready i'm
[1:43:05] almost done the past is the impression
[1:43:12] so all these years we have been under
[1:43:15] military
[1:43:16] preparation what is military preparation
[1:43:19] it's a ministry of the word
[1:43:22] the ministry of the world you cannot
[1:43:23] send a man out into battle
[1:43:25] if he hasn't been trained and there's
[1:43:28] different kinds of training
[1:43:29] there's physical training there's mental
[1:43:32] training
[1:43:32] there's psychological training there's
[1:43:34] academic training
[1:43:35] when you go to these military schools
[1:43:38] they have you study
[1:43:39] what julius caesar did what napoleon did
[1:43:42] what alexander the great did
[1:43:44] what hitler did all the strategies
[1:43:47] because when you go into the battlefield
[1:43:48] you don't know what strategy you have to
[1:43:51] use
[1:43:53] and you can't have it in mind only it
[1:43:55] must be in demonstration
[1:43:56] you have to shoot if you know order
[1:43:58] terry and you can't shoot straight
[1:44:00] the enemy is there pow pow pow pow it's
[1:44:03] there's the enemy and you're telling
[1:44:04] them shoot over there and you should
[1:44:05] leave me here
[1:44:09] we want to be on the beam we want to be
[1:44:11] on the target
[1:44:12] we want you to identify the enemy
[1:44:15] wherever he is at
[1:44:16] and be able to place your target and
[1:44:19] your attack directly on him
[1:44:20] because once you direct the word which
[1:44:22] is your weapon to him he has to go
[1:44:24] the sword of the sword of the spirit
[1:44:27] which is the word of god can the church
[1:44:28] say amen
[1:44:30] my my my you could begin to play
[1:44:33] something software i'll have to finish
[1:44:34] this message some of the time
[1:44:36] but every service what are we doing
[1:44:39] getting ready for a holy war
[1:44:43] a spiritual battle a final showdown
[1:44:46] and we are waiting for dynamics to take
[1:44:49] us to the final battle
[1:44:51] god has been waiting for the right
[1:44:52] season the right time the right people
[1:44:55] and i say this morning sirs is this the
[1:44:56] time god had to pull you out from the
[1:44:59] world
[1:45:00] you had to be baptized filled with the
[1:45:02] holy ghost
[1:45:03] go to a place of trying reach adoption
[1:45:05] and in silence
[1:45:06] when your family couldn't understand you
[1:45:08] when nobody could understand you
[1:45:10] god has been preparing you so i say
[1:45:13] again this morning
[1:45:14] this is not the time for you to die this
[1:45:17] is not the time for us to run and hide
[1:45:19] and defend
[1:45:20] this morning we declare that the time
[1:45:21] has come to stand
[1:45:23] and haven't done all to keep on standing
[1:45:27] don't give up after you have tried
[1:45:29] talking to your children don't give up
[1:45:31] stand
[1:45:32] after you have applied for job after job
[1:45:35] don't give up
[1:45:36] stand after your pray for the holy ghost
[1:45:38] don't give up
[1:45:39] stand having that all stand
[1:45:43] after you upside and you cried stand
[1:45:46] after you have tried him and tried him
[1:45:48] and you pressed your way
[1:45:49] and it seems as if nothing is working
[1:45:51] out still stand
[1:45:53] having it all to stand stand let
[1:45:56] everything go wrong but the baron said
[1:45:58] let everybody else prosper
[1:45:59] let the others prosper let the men who
[1:46:01] have a form of godliness deny the power
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:07] but if you know where you'll stand
[1:46:08] you'll stand regardless if the whole
[1:46:10] world tears you down
[1:46:12] you'll stand just the same you won't
[1:46:14] vary
[1:46:15] from that word because the battle is the
[1:46:18] lord's battle
[1:46:19] just keep on standing who was on the
[1:46:21] lord's side this morning
[1:46:23] can you lift your hands this morning and
[1:46:26] give god praise
[1:46:27] we have a commission from god to make a
[1:46:30] church
[1:46:31] that will make a revival another
[1:46:33] ephesians
[1:46:34] another book of action to kill kill
[1:46:36] every villain's time
[1:46:38] every amalekite you may be seeing it for
[1:46:40] a minute
[1:46:45] so i'm going a little bit
[1:46:48] to be on to drive them out to say listen
[1:46:52] kill them all
[1:46:59] so there's drive out because it's your
[1:47:01] land but our ministry
[1:47:02] is not just to drive them out it's to
[1:47:04] kill them all
[1:47:06] because in every age throughout history
[1:47:10] and the bible supports it
[1:47:12] this tribe didn't kill them all this
[1:47:13] tribe didn't kill them
[1:47:15] caleb expelled the sons of enoch
[1:47:19] but it is these spirits throughout all
[1:47:21] the ages
[1:47:22] that are still in the church today and
[1:47:25] that's why brother branham's talking
[1:47:26] about if we could deserve to withstand
[1:47:28] the two spirits
[1:47:30] working within the framework of the
[1:47:31] church but
[1:47:33] this is the only age where the egyptians
[1:47:36] you see today
[1:47:38] you will see them no more forever this
[1:47:40] is the only age
[1:47:42] where satan at the end will be bombed by
[1:47:44] circumstance
[1:47:46] bound for a thousand years for years
[1:47:48] they couldn't find him
[1:47:49] they would hold him for a season and he
[1:47:51] would come back out but after this age
[1:47:53] its thousand years bone eternal finish
[1:47:57] and we shall remain on the earth the
[1:47:59] devil has been squatting on this earth
[1:48:01] for a long time
[1:48:02] but the brethren taught us that he is a
[1:48:05] prince of the power of the air
[1:48:06] that the air is infected the land is
[1:48:09] infected
[1:48:10] and that's why it's been a battle since
[1:48:12] adam fell
[1:48:13] until now that's why god says a new
[1:48:15] heaven
[1:48:16] and a new earth god will send fire to
[1:48:19] consume this place
[1:48:20] but this bride will be that elect lady
[1:48:23] that god will raise up into that holy
[1:48:26] city new jerusalem
[1:48:28] that will make the rapture that when
[1:48:30] that fire consumes the urchin
[1:48:32] she will walk up on the ashes and she
[1:48:35] will say this
[1:48:36] is our earth this is our land and the
[1:48:39] bible says
[1:48:40] we shall reign on the earth we're not
[1:48:43] going to reign in heaven
[1:48:45] this is our land the devil has taken our
[1:48:48] land
[1:48:48] no wonder the trees are groaning no
[1:48:51] wonder the seas are groaning for the
[1:48:53] manifestation
[1:48:54] of the sons of god
[1:48:57] and listen the trees know we are coming
[1:49:01] back
[1:49:02] the earth knows that we are coming back
[1:49:04] up
[1:49:05] the earthquakes are happening because we
[1:49:08] are coming back
[1:49:09] sons of god daughters of god are coming
[1:49:12] back into position can the church say
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:16] somebody give god a shout somebody give
[1:49:19] god a shout out praise
[1:49:21] somebody give god worship in the house
[1:49:23] of
[1:49:26] god so this morning
[1:49:29] i'm closing out i'm ready to fight for
[1:49:32] the fate

[1:49:35] was restored by malachi
