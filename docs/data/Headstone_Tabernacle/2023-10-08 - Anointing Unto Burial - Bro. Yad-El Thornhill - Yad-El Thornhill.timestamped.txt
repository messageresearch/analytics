[1:03:56] praise God hallelujah praise God
[1:03:59] hallelujah you may be
[1:04:01] seated just want to say a few
[1:04:04] words
[1:04:05] uh it's only this year I had a chat with
[1:04:09] brother tonel about something that
[1:04:10] happened about 30 plus years ago I had
[1:04:13] invited him to uh to eat have a
[1:04:16] something to talk with him fellowship
[1:04:18] with and he never asked me why how it
[1:04:21] came about but only this year I shared
[1:04:25] with him something the Lord showed me
[1:04:26] concerning him and I feel today I'm
[1:04:29] actually walking into a
[1:04:30] vision so I know that uh it's just
[1:04:33] what's timing of things you can't speak
[1:04:36] everything but you could just walk by
[1:04:38] faith so since way back then I couldn't
[1:04:40] tell him that but I told him that this
[1:04:42] year I told him what the Lord told me
[1:04:44] about 30 plus years
[1:04:46] ago so I know that uh nothing is by
[1:04:49] chance and everything is in order and
[1:04:52] everything according to Romans 820 work
[1:04:54] together for good to them that love God
[1:04:56] to them who are called according to his
[1:04:58] purpose so nothing is out of timing I
[1:05:02] always believe that God have his men
[1:05:04] everywhere God have his Davids
[1:05:06] everywhere remember David didn't just
[1:05:08] come out from the Army David wasn't
[1:05:10] polish in Boots he was seeing about
[1:05:12] sheep in the backside of the desert
[1:05:14] nobody knew they wasn't there they
[1:05:15] wasn't there they wasn't there they
[1:05:16] didn't see what happened but when ready
[1:05:19] when God is ready God will take a man
[1:05:21] from the back and bring him to the front
[1:05:24] when God is ready when God is ready God
[1:05:28] could do whatever he have to do you may
[1:05:30] be seated and what I love about God he
[1:05:33] doesn't have to ask anybody permission
[1:05:35] to do anything he could bless he could
[1:05:38] deliver he could give you a miracle this
[1:05:41] morning he could free you from your past
[1:05:43] free you from your guilt free you from
[1:05:45] your fears he could do that right this
[1:05:47] morning oh give the Lord some

[1:13:00] want to turn in our
[1:13:01] Bibles we want to go to Matthew chapter
[1:13:09] 26 verse one and it came to pass when
[1:13:13] Jesus had finished all these Saints he
[1:13:15] said unto his disciples so we know what
[1:13:18] Saints they're talking about right
[1:13:20] Matthew chapter 26 is on the heels of
[1:13:23] chap
[1:13:24] 24 which you have him opening up the
[1:13:26] Seven Seals and then go over into
[1:13:29] chapter 25 with the wise virgins and the
[1:13:32] foolish virgins the bride that could
[1:13:34] take that word and hand it there a bride
[1:13:37] that has oil in her
[1:13:41] lamps after these
[1:13:43] things uh when he finished all these
[1:13:45] things he said unto his disciples you
[1:13:47] know that after two days is the Feast of
[1:13:49] the Passover when the son of man is
[1:13:50] betrayed to be crucified so he knew the
[1:13:53] Jun he that then assembl all the chief
[1:13:56] priests and the scribes and the Elders
[1:13:58] of the people unto the Palace of the
[1:14:00] high priest who was called cifas and
[1:14:05] consulted that they might take Jesus by
[1:14:07] subtlety and kill
[1:14:09] him but they said not on the feast day
[1:14:13] least there be an upro among the people
[1:14:16] and when Jesus was in Bethany in the
[1:14:18] house of Simon the leper there came unto
[1:14:22] him a a woman having an alabaster box of
[1:14:27] very precious ointment and poured it on
[1:14:31] his head as he sat his
[1:14:34] meat and when his disciples saw it they
[1:14:38] had ignation saying to what purpose is
[1:14:41] this waste for this ointment might have
[1:14:44] been sold for much and given to the poor
[1:14:47] and when Jesus understood it he said

[1:15:32] can't take his message Hallelujah
[1:15:35] wherever this gospel shall be preached

[1:15:40] that this woman had done be told for a
[1:15:44] memorial of Me no of
[1:15:49] her glory be to God in highest Blessed
[1:15:53] Be name may the Lord Jesus add the
[1:15:54] riches of His blessings to the reading
[1:15:56] of his word we may be seated this
[1:15:58] morning
[1:16:00] am amen and
[1:16:03] amen so
[1:16:05] we certainly feel the warmth the welcome
[1:16:09] the atmosphere that created here in
[1:16:13] the Assembly of the Saints the Church of
[1:16:16] the
[1:16:17] firstborn brother we thank God for the
[1:16:20] opportunity to be here that has been in
[1:16:23] trusted unto us brother to a mighty man
[1:16:25] of Valor brother
[1:16:28] Isaac all the brothers
[1:16:34] here that would see fit to allow a
[1:16:38] little nobody as I am to come and say
[1:16:41] something to God
[1:16:44] somebody's amen I'm just a little nobody
[1:16:47] trying to tell everybody about somebody
[1:16:51] Hallelujah brother who can save their
[1:16:54] souls amen hallelujah hallelujah so as
[1:16:59] the prophet say we are Mortals we will
[1:17:01] have shortcomings we will have mistakes
[1:17:03] but this word will never fail amen and
[1:17:07] uh you know uh do believe need any
[1:17:10] introduction to this morning brother
[1:17:12] Theo say we don't need any introduction
[1:17:14] he said just go ahead into the word so
[1:17:16] we want to go straight into the word by
[1:17:18] God's grace uh you know we want to see
[1:17:22] what God would have have in stored for
[1:17:23] us this morning amen and uh we want to
[1:17:27] take for a little thought this morning
[1:17:28] anointing unto
[1:17:30] burial uh this comes from this chapter
[1:17:33] here we want to read a few scriptures
[1:17:35] this morning and see what God would give
[1:17:37] us Grace what the holy spirit will open
[1:17:39] up to us this
[1:17:41] morning and this scene here this
[1:17:44] anointing uh unto burial this was a
[1:17:47] season 2,000 years ago that was a
[1:17:50] junction there but we know the Bible is
[1:17:52] not a hist history book where things
[1:17:55] happen and that is it you know but our
[1:17:58] God is the present tense Hallelujah
[1:18:02] present
[1:18:03] continuous Hallelujah he is the great I
[1:18:05] am not I was or I will be but the I am
[1:18:09] he's ever present Hallelujah so that God
[1:18:14] you know things would happen and we
[1:18:16] would see things happen in the Old
[1:18:17] Testament things happen in the New
[1:18:19] Testament but those are shadows there
[1:18:21] are a lot of prophecies there are lot a
[1:18:23] nuggets locked up inside of there for us
[1:18:25] coming down on the journey now remember
[1:18:27] this is the Golden Age this is the age
[1:18:29] that all men long to live Hallelujah
[1:18:33] this is the climax this is the closing
[1:18:35] and God keeps the best wine for last so
[1:18:38] in this closing of time the scene the
[1:18:40] events the things that taking place
[1:18:43] there is a selected bunch of people to
[1:18:46] keep up with the continuity of what is
[1:18:48] going on and how we keep up with
[1:18:50] continuity we watch what was and we
[1:18:53] understand what will be and it gives us
[1:18:56] a clear picture of where we
[1:18:58] are all right so in this scene here we
[1:19:02] want to see from this little scene this
[1:19:05] morning what God would have for us this
[1:19:07] morning because I believe it was
[1:19:10] anointing dear un to burial that was
[1:19:12] quite back there but it have a lot to do
[1:19:14] with us
[1:19:16] today all right so our God is the same
[1:19:20] yesterday today and forever he change it
[1:19:24] not and we saw you know it was coming
[1:19:27] down to the time of the crucifixion
[1:19:29] which was the for ordained predestinate
[1:19:33] predestinated councel of almighty God
[1:19:36] that Jesus should being the lamb should
[1:19:39] walk this journey he should Walk This
[1:19:41] Way he knew Hallelujah as your pilot and
[1:19:45] they said Bo you don't know I have power
[1:19:47] over you he said what you have no power
[1:19:49] unless it given you from above for this
[1:19:52] cause came out into the world Hallelujah
[1:19:55] so he knew based on scripture his
[1:19:58] ministry started brother his entire life
[1:20:01] was
[1:20:02] scripture before he came brother
[1:20:04] prophets prophesied of him his birth was
[1:20:07] under prophecy his life was prophecy
[1:20:10] Hallelujah he was introduced the man to
[1:20:13] introduce him was prophesied of
[1:20:16] thousands of years hundreds of years
[1:20:17] before he was born that's John the
[1:20:20] Baptist his death his resurrection was
[1:20:23] side everything about his ministry was
[1:20:26] was in Prophecy so with prophecy the
[1:20:29] thing about prophecy is that you cannot
[1:20:31] make it come to pass there there's a lot
[1:20:33] of time for it to come to pass so we
[1:20:35] would understand with Jesus Jesus
[1:20:39] understood his
[1:20:40] Junctions all right and there was a time
[1:20:43] for everything so Jesus coming down here
[1:20:46] and we had the opening of the World
[1:20:48] chapter 24 and chapter 25 he give them
[1:20:51] the the the the foolish virgins the wise
[1:20:54] virgins and you know he was bringing
[1:20:58] them into an
[1:21:00] atmosphere
[1:21:02] Hallelujah of something yeah and chapter
[1:21:04] 26 here we saw where the council had to
[1:21:08] tighten up to bring certain things to
[1:21:10] come to pass so for them to tighten up
[1:21:13] they needed some inside
[1:21:16] information
[1:21:18] Hallelujah Israel and end up in war J
[1:21:20] you know so they want know how those
[1:21:24] bombs thousands of bombs could drop
[1:21:26] missiles and Israel don't know anything
[1:21:29] it had to come some inside thing had to
[1:21:32] be covered up something had to leak from
[1:21:34] inside so they they want to deal now
[1:21:36] with the intelligence agency how you all
[1:21:39] don't know that this was coming
[1:21:42] on all right but man could be caught una
[1:21:45] awes but not almighty God
[1:21:49] hallelujah so the man to unite with the
[1:21:53] state was
[1:21:55] Judas he was the inside man that was to
[1:21:58] give information he had to sell that
[1:22:01] information Hallelujah and Jesus knew
[1:22:04] from the beginning he said I've chose 12
[1:22:06] but one of you is a devil so he
[1:22:08] understood exactly brother what it took
[1:22:11] to bring him to that stage so it wasn't
[1:22:14] a disappointment for him weers get
[1:22:17] disappointed Hallelujah but but God is
[1:22:20] not disappointed that was already
[1:22:22] written in the script so Jesus here he
[1:22:26] knew the time was coming down and uh
[1:22:29] these Chief priests wanted to get him
[1:22:33] but that had to be so now notice the
[1:22:36] lamb had to be inspected he had to pass
[1:22:38] you a period of inspection so Jesus now
[1:22:40] coming up to that week of inspection
[1:22:43] Hallelujah he had to be spotless
[1:22:47] Hallelujah very good now he end up here
[1:22:51] in betting
[1:22:53] in the house of Simon the leper and an
[1:22:56] event took place now before he came to
[1:22:59] Bethany it was a journey he was on
[1:23:01] because he was wrapping up coming down
[1:23:02] to the end of his ministry and he left
[1:23:05] Jericho and he was coming down he had
[1:23:07] bet araba and then he had Bethany had
[1:23:10] Jerusalem Bethany was n unto Jerusalem
[1:23:13] so leaving Jericho the cursed he go into
[1:23:15] the city of the bless
[1:23:18] hallelujah amen glory be to God in the
[1:23:21] highest coming down to the end of his of
[1:23:23] his journey leaving the curse going to
[1:23:26] the bless
[1:23:28] Hallelujah and going to the bless There
[1:23:31] They Crucified him they the most holy
[1:23:34] place they the most holy people crucify
[1:23:38] the most gruesome that him the most holy
[1:23:40] one what a paradox all right so leaving
[1:23:45] there on his
[1:23:49] journey what took place is that Jesus
[1:23:52] had a close friend and this friend's
[1:23:54] name was
[1:23:56] Lazarus amen so we we could trace the
[1:24:00] story in different gospels Matthew the
[1:24:03] king portrayed it a certain way uh if we
[1:24:06] go over to John the eagle we would see
[1:24:09] John's description of this same event uh
[1:24:12] in chapter 12 in the Book of
[1:24:14] John and uh chapter 12 in St John came
[1:24:19] on the heels of chapter 11 yes now
[1:24:21] chapter 11 11 was the resurrection of
[1:24:26] Lazarus now let us watch this scene a
[1:24:29] little bit here this morning to
[1:24:30] understand because the anointing took
[1:24:33] place after the
[1:24:36] resurrection Hallelujah of
[1:24:39] Lazarus okay so Lazarus being one that
[1:24:42] Jesus
[1:24:44] loved fell sick Lazarus as a scribe
[1:24:48] brother in the temple he dealt in all
[1:24:50] the books he understand the he
[1:24:52] understood the word of God hallelujah he
[1:24:55] was he was a great friend with Jesus now
[1:24:56] you see the kind of friends that Jesus
[1:24:58] had Hallelujah show me your friends and
[1:25:01] I'll tell you who you are Hallelujah now
[1:25:04] notice Lazarus was not a disciple he
[1:25:07] wasn't an apostle but he was a
[1:25:09] friend Hallelujah and God deals a
[1:25:12] certain way with his friends Hallelujah
[1:25:15] Glory P to God in the highest and
[1:25:18] Lazarus fell sick and Mary and Martha
[1:25:21] who were sisters sent to call Jesus so
[1:25:27] St John chapter 11 a certain man was
[1:25:30] sick named Lazarus of Bethany now we
[1:25:31] know Bethany means House of
[1:25:35] misery so the location have a lot to do
[1:25:39] with what was go on in your
[1:25:40] life that was a house of misery so there
[1:25:43] would be things that would happen there
[1:25:46] that uh it was miserable for them
[1:25:49] Hallelujah that came in in the house
[1:25:52] and notice that always come when Jesus
[1:25:54] is
[1:25:56] absent when AB when Adam was absent the
[1:26:00] serent came to
[1:26:02] eeve Hallelujah so it's in the absence
[1:26:05] is where the devil
[1:26:07] slipping and it was that Mary which
[1:26:10] anointed the Lord with ointment and wipe
[1:26:13] his feet with a hair whose brother
[1:26:14] Lazarus was sick so we understanding now
[1:26:17] who it was it was Mary so Matthew say a
[1:26:21] woman
[1:26:23] Hallelujah but John the eagle Hallelujah
[1:26:26] he saw a little higher he gave us a name
[1:26:29] you see because name is important oh
[1:26:32] glory be to God in the
[1:26:35] highest amen you know for the anointing
[1:26:38] to drop in the book of Acts you had 120
[1:26:42] in the upper room and you know the
[1:26:44] scriptures say they they check the
[1:26:46] number of the names Acts chapter 1 verse
[1:26:49] 15 so your name is important in
[1:26:54] Hallelujah Prophet show that new name
[1:26:56] will be revealing it
[1:26:57] th all right so God have something in
[1:27:01] store for us a revelation specific to
[1:27:04] this bride it had to be revealed to you
[1:27:08] personally and God don't really count
[1:27:11] numbers people he count names Hallelujah
[1:27:16] in those days verse 15 acts 1:15 in
[1:27:18] those days Peter stood up in the midst
[1:27:20] of the disciples and said the number of
[1:27:23] the names together were about
[1:27:26] 120 namous
[1:27:29] characteristics so not just number of
[1:27:32] people but number of names your name is
[1:27:36] important Hallelujah rejoice when you
[1:27:38] see a name written in the book
[1:27:41] Hallelujah because this flesh is not
[1:27:44] important this flesh is not written any
[1:27:46] book this flesh can get sick but there's
[1:27:48] a name Hallelujah that is Ted down to
[1:27:51] this the name is inside there and the
[1:27:54] name causes this to behave a certain
[1:27:57] way your name is over your
[1:27:59] feeling Hallelujah you might be sick but
[1:28:03] because of who you are your
[1:28:05] representation in God's word it brings
[1:28:07] this under subjection Hallelujah so name
[1:28:11] is
[1:28:12] important
[1:28:14] Hallelujah sometimes you're born and
[1:28:15] your family give you the wrong name
[1:28:17] Hallelujah but because of fats and
[1:28:20] things that are done yeah men receive a
[1:28:22] name
[1:28:23] change for the work that lays ahead you
[1:28:26] shall no more be called Simon but Peter
[1:28:29] Peter is Stone is Rock his
[1:28:31] confession had to do with his ministry
[1:28:33] what is coming
[1:28:35] up Hallelujah so Jesus changed his name
[1:28:39] Abram is not father Nations but Abraham
[1:28:42] so just before brother the manifestation
[1:28:45] came the name
[1:28:47] changed right so name is important so
[1:28:50] John give us the name he identified who
[1:28:52] it was now this Mary was a certain kind
[1:28:55] of a woman and um they sent a CER to
[1:28:59] tell
[1:29:01] Jesus that so he left Jericho and he was
[1:29:04] coming down he was in bet Arab somewhere
[1:29:07] around there and uh his this messenger
[1:29:12] came with the message Jesus he whom thou
[1:29:15] lovest is
[1:29:16] sick and you know what Jesus
[1:29:19] did Hallelujah he heard the message Meer
[1:29:23] and he said this sickness is not unto
[1:29:26] death but for the glory of God and he
[1:29:31] remain where he
[1:29:34] was the script say when he heard thereof
[1:29:36] he was sick he had Bor two days still in
[1:29:39] the same place where he
[1:29:42] was then after that he said to his
[1:29:45] disciples let us go to Judea again so
[1:29:49] two days on the third day he said let us
[1:29:51] go
[1:29:52] the journey day and by the fourth day
[1:29:55] Lazarus done dead and buried it's four
[1:29:57] days he dead all right so look at this
[1:30:02] when Jesus came I was showing you this
[1:30:05] family this Mary and Mara when Jesus
[1:30:09] came to the house well he didn't reach
[1:30:11] to the house yet but as he was going we
[1:30:14] know the disciples say well boy Jesus
[1:30:16] say he's sleeping they say well if he's
[1:30:17] sleeping he do well and Jesus now you
[1:30:21] see what he was in a real he saw
[1:30:23] something already and he saw this was
[1:30:26] for the glory of God so the disciples
[1:30:30] now down in the humanistic realm Jesus
[1:30:32] in a realm of divine revelation in a
[1:30:34] realm of vision he a little higher so
[1:30:36] it's possible you could be walking with
[1:30:38] someone but they in a different realm
[1:30:39] they're in a different dimension than
[1:30:41] you are
[1:30:42] in
[1:30:44] Hallelujah Elijah saw innumerable
[1:30:47] company of angels all around and Elijah
[1:30:49] was at ease and GES worried said Lord
[1:30:53] open the boy
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:55] eyes
[1:30:57] Hallelujah so it depends what you're
[1:30:59] looking at it depends what you're
[1:31:03] seeing Hallelujah God taking us higher
[1:31:06] in every day with God is higher and
[1:31:08] higher is deeper and deeper so the
[1:31:10] Propet shows us if you have like a fish
[1:31:14] or or let's say you mission missing a
[1:31:16] sense of sight and someone tell you boy
[1:31:18] those flowers so beautiful but all you
[1:31:20] could do is touch it all
[1:31:22] right then when you receive your sight
[1:31:26] now it is an added
[1:31:29] sense that makes this thing so much
[1:31:32] beautiful now the sense don't put it
[1:31:34] there you know but the sense now gives
[1:31:36] you the ability to to Rich it to
[1:31:39] appreciate
[1:31:42] it Hallelujah your healing is there
[1:31:45] already know fear don't bring it in it
[1:31:48] is there Hallelujah but by we can walk
[1:31:52] through it when that senses open up to
[1:31:55] us amen so you sure now if you missing
[1:32:00] your sight you cannot appreciate it but
[1:32:03] then when you receive the sight you can
[1:32:05] appreciate it you so on that next side
[1:32:08] when you receive your new
[1:32:10] body that body don't function by T see
[1:32:14] taste smell touch it function in a
[1:32:17] higher
[1:32:18] realm Hallelujah we receive a higher
[1:32:21] sense that is a thousand times better
[1:32:23] than these
[1:32:24] senses what would that life be
[1:32:28] Hallelujah glory be to God in highest so
[1:32:32] God giv us glimpses of that he taken us
[1:32:34] into a higher realm now Glory you watch
[1:32:39] Faith now Jesus in that realm he say
[1:32:41] sleep it they say if he sleep it that
[1:32:43] good Jesus said no what he dead he said
[1:32:46] but I'm going to wake him they said all
[1:32:48] right we going wake him now when Jesus
[1:32:51] reached
[1:32:52] and they heard that Jesus was coming so
[1:32:54] they run before he came he came into the
[1:32:56] village he didn't reach to the house yet
[1:32:58] he came into the village and news came
[1:33:00] Jesus is coming now while Jesus delayed
[1:33:03] there is a test of their
[1:33:05] Fai because this is the man that they
[1:33:07] love this was a friend he had a room in
[1:33:10] the
[1:33:11] house and now when difficulty come he
[1:33:14] know where
[1:33:16] wrong so imagine what the Pharisees
[1:33:19] would have been saying to Mary and at
[1:33:22] that
[1:33:23] time all
[1:33:25] right Hallelujah but Mary wasn't weak in
[1:33:29] F Mary is a type of the Bride is a
[1:33:33] certain kind of
[1:33:34] woman hallelujah
[1:33:38] hallelujah early on in Luke I believe
[1:33:41] it's Luke chapter 10 we saw Jesus in the
[1:33:44] house before they sickness took place
[1:33:47] right in Bethany in Mary's and mata's
[1:33:50] house and and while Jesus was there it
[1:33:53] came to pass he went verse 28 M Luke
[1:33:56] 10:28 he entered into a certain Village
[1:33:59] in and a certain woman named Mara
[1:34:01] received him into her house yeah and she
[1:34:04] had a sister called Mary which also sat
[1:34:08] at Jesus's feet and heard his
[1:34:12] word be not yeah Mara received him into
[1:34:16] the house but Mary sat at his feet and
[1:34:19] received the
[1:34:20] word

[1:34:27] sisters later down Hallelujah I'm
[1:34:30] showing you your test is be Faith your
[1:34:32] faith is be test right Glory she
[1:34:36] received his word and Mara was cumbered
[1:34:40] about much serving if we have enough

[1:34:45] no napkins on the table yet the food
[1:34:47] ain't finished who ain't bring this this
[1:34:49] one us to bring that and she cumbered
[1:34:52] and the word going

[1:35:05] about she could as come upon what
[1:35:08] certain and came to him and said Lord
[1:35:10] does not now care that my sister had
[1:35:12] left me to serve
[1:35:15] alone better her therefore that she
[1:35:17] helped
[1:35:20] me
[1:35:22] glory be to
[1:35:23] God let us hear Jesus's response

[1:41:54] death come then he allow
[1:41:56] it that's his
[1:41:58] will all right you got to understand
[1:42:01] that so it's who with us there's someone
[1:42:04] with us don't look down the road this it
[1:42:07] it here and you're going to see
[1:42:10] something Hallelujah believest thou this
[1:42:14] and the key is to believe it with the
[1:42:17] prophet the angel told him get the
[1:42:18] people to believe you and nothing even
[1:42:21] cancer will stand in your way so the key
[1:42:24] about it is getting us up into that
[1:42:27] atmosphere you see it's a certain
[1:42:29] presence that he bringing us into
[1:42:31] Hallelujah and those pulsations of Faith
[1:42:34] this they start to move Hallelujah in
[1:42:38] this Seasons those moments are crisis
[1:42:41] Hallelujah and you start to see the hand
[1:42:43] of God on the
[1:42:48] scene
[1:42:49] so
[1:42:51] believest th
[1:42:54] this you see the word for your Day
[1:42:57] present tense so he spoke to Martha
[1:43:02] there but Mary wasn't there
[1:43:06] notice
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:09] Hallelujah she said I know I believe you
[1:43:11] are the Christ verse 28 and when she had
[1:43:13] so said she went away and called Mary
[1:43:16] her sister secretly saying the master is
[1:43:20] come
[1:43:22] and call it for
[1:43:25] the he talking to Mara yes but we
[1:43:29] Mary Hallelujah that's the one where is
[1:43:34] she
[1:43:35] Hallelujah you see because for the
[1:43:38] vision to be fulfilled everybody had to
[1:43:40] be in
[1:43:41] order Hallelujah the prophet taught us
[1:43:45] that whether is a lady with a red dress
[1:43:48] had to sit on in a certain chair or
[1:43:50] somebody with her
[1:43:54] glasses glory be to
[1:44:01] God it had a brother that needed to be
[1:44:06] healed uh there was some Demon on him
[1:44:09] either epilepsy or some forceful demon
[1:44:12] that would come on him and they told the
[1:44:15] prophet they wanted him to pray for him
[1:44:17] the prophet said all right bring him
[1:44:19] loose him I will pray for him they said
[1:44:21] no he he terrible and if you lose him
[1:44:23] and we can't do that and they afraid So
[1:44:25] eventually they say well after the
[1:44:27] service and um God showed the prophet a
[1:44:30] vision and they took him out to this
[1:44:33] park and the the thing about it is that
[1:44:36] in the vision everything was right the
[1:44:39] guy was in the car but there was a
[1:44:42] certain car parked on the other side of
[1:44:44] the park that was really gold or red or
[1:44:48] something like that and at that time
[1:44:51] when they after the meeting was
[1:44:52] dismissed uh they they went to open
[1:44:55] because they they afraid if they let go
[1:44:57] the man he would destroy the prophet so
[1:44:59] we going and do this thing now in a
[1:45:01] field it could run so they they went by
[1:45:04] a park and they loosen him in the back
[1:45:08] but the prophet see the thing already
[1:45:09] and he say
[1:45:11] watch we had a wait in him because there
[1:45:16] was the car over there but it's supposed
[1:45:17] to be either a red or a gold or
[1:45:19] something red right and at that time of
[1:45:24] the night the car looking let me say
[1:45:26] white or gold or gray whatever so they
[1:45:29] had to wait he said that is not the car
[1:45:31] so they had to wait whole
[1:45:34] night and then when the sun start to
[1:45:36] rise in the
[1:45:38] morning and the sun start to shine on
[1:45:40] the car that whether it's black or gold
[1:45:44] car or whatever it turned to red or
[1:45:46] whatever I may have the colors mix up
[1:45:48] but you understand but the reflection of
[1:45:50] the Sun on it changed the color and then
[1:45:52] the prophet say now is the
[1:45:54] time loose him
[1:45:58] Hallelujah glory be to God any higher so
[1:46:02] there's a timing for everything your
[1:46:05] deliverance there's a timing for it
[1:46:08] Hallelujah glory be to God in the
[1:46:10] highest where is Mary call for her
[1:46:14] hallelujah
[1:46:19] hallelujah
[1:46:23] amen the master call it for the was a
[1:46:26] relationship hallelujah thank you sir so
[1:46:30] he call it for thee and
[1:46:35] amen GL God
[1:46:39] in now
[1:46:42] watch the prince of the House of David
[1:46:44] the prophet referred to that book and um
[1:46:47] that book has a lot of nice things about
[1:46:48] Jesus and his walk and and what they
[1:46:51] were saying there is that Mary remained
[1:46:54] in the house she heard Jesus was coming
[1:46:57] but she wasn't answer she you know she
[1:46:58] went remain in the house because if you
[1:47:01] hear Jesus coming everybody get up and
[1:47:02] the Run matter get up and run but Mary
[1:47:06] remained preparing his
[1:47:09] room she had confidence brother that he
[1:47:15] is coming he has a
[1:47:17] purpose all is well amen
[1:47:21] so she stayed there and she prepared his
[1:47:23] room and there were some Jews that were
[1:47:25] with her and uh look at the as soon as
[1:47:28] she heard that verse 29 she arose
[1:47:31] quickly so when Mara came down she
[1:47:33] called she say he the master calling for
[1:47:35] you then she arose quickly and she went
[1:47:37] and Jesus was not yet come into the
[1:47:39] tongue but he was at a place where Mara
[1:47:42] met him and then this is where all the
[1:47:45] Jews came up and they were following him
[1:47:47] and uh the the tomb of Lazarus was
[1:47:50] before before the house of Lazarus all
[1:47:52] right so on the way the idea is after
[1:47:55] this Mata ran to the house to start to
[1:47:58] prepare things now because Jesus say he
[1:48:01] will live again amen so after Mary
[1:48:04] prepared a room for Jesus Mar run back
[1:48:07] home now to prepare for
[1:48:11] Lazarus because Lazarus coming the
[1:48:14] thought is Jesus not coming in the house
[1:48:17] without
[1:48:19] Lazarus
[1:48:21] everything taking place on the outside
[1:48:23] when he reach back here Lazarus will be
[1:48:26] at his
[1:48:27] side
[1:48:29] Hallelujah Glory
[1:48:31] Peter confidence Hallelujah and this is
[1:48:35] what God bringing us in today by day is
[1:48:37] a confidence that God will keep his word
[1:48:41] what he said he's able to bring to pass
[1:48:44] Hallelujah we talking about a raptor we
[1:48:46] talking about a body change Hallelujah
[1:48:51] we can't produce that we can't do it but
[1:48:56] we believe in one who promis it
[1:48:59] Hallelujah and his words his promises
[1:49:02] are yeah and there if he say it he will
[1:49:04] bring it to
[1:49:06] pass
[1:49:09] Hallelujah so this is where the
[1:49:12] resurrection of Lazarus took place on
[1:49:15] the outside before he came home and Mary
[1:49:19] came now no Noti when Mary came verse 32
[1:49:23] she go onto the grave to weep there so
[1:49:25] everybody say well Mary going and weep
[1:49:27] and they start a follow off verse 32 and
[1:49:29] when Mary was come where Jesus was she
[1:49:32] saw him she fell down at his feet saying
[1:49:34] unto him Lord if thou been here where
[1:49:36] she fell at his feet
[1:49:39] again now when she fell at Jesus's feet
[1:49:43] there those were Dusty bruised feet from
[1:49:48] the journey
[1:49:51] Jesus didn't come in an air conditioned
[1:49:53] car is
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:58] walking she found herself down at
[1:50:01] Jesus's feet and her attitude was Lord
[1:50:04] if you had been
[1:50:07] here my brother had not
[1:50:09] died and then Jesus when he saw Mary
[1:50:12] weaping he started Gro within him said
[1:50:14] he said where you put him where you
[1:50:17] lay they said let him come and see and
[1:50:19] Jesus WEP this is the shortest verse in
[1:50:21] the
[1:50:22] Bible Hallelujah and when they saw Jesus
[1:50:25] weeping they said boy look how we loved
[1:50:27] him and uh they said boy he could have
[1:50:29] been here uh he wouldn't have died but
[1:50:32] God had a purpose in this all right and
[1:50:35] he told them take away the stone and we
[1:50:36] know the whole story how it went and
[1:50:40] Jesus now he lifted up his eyes to
[1:50:42] Heaven he said father know you always
[1:50:43] hear me
[1:50:45] Hallelujah it was a vision he saw he
[1:50:48] knew that's right this was the time when
[1:50:50] the son should be
[1:50:52] glorified
[1:50:55] Hallelujah
[1:50:57] Glory I thank thee that thou has heard
[1:50:59] me father I know that thou hearest me
[1:51:01] always but because of the people which
[1:51:02] stand by I said it that they might
[1:51:04] believe that thou has sent me and when
[1:51:06] he had does when he D had spoken he
[1:51:09] cried with a loud voice
[1:51:11] Lazarus come
[1:51:16] Fort and he that was dead came for
[1:51:21] so wherever his Spirit was in that
[1:51:23] Dimension brother corruption his eyes
[1:51:26] had sunken already and all that went on
[1:51:28] corruption was already in the body when
[1:51:32] Jesus called corruption knew it
[1:51:36] master and everything started to come
[1:51:38] back together and Lazarus came
[1:51:43] out Jesus told him loose
[1:51:46] him let him go so he came out bom W but
[1:51:51] he had to be
[1:51:53] loosed
[1:51:54] hallelujah look at it out of your
[1:51:56] situations
[1:51:58] now the word just call you out of your
[1:52:01] situations but you still had to REM uh
[1:52:04] be able to take
[1:52:07] correction Lazarus come and say boy I
[1:52:09] raise no he can't lose
[1:52:12] himself the people are wrong you with
[1:52:15] love and with affection and watching
[1:52:18] what going on in your life they could be
[1:52:20] able to take those napkins and cloths
[1:52:23] from off of you Hallelujah that the
[1:52:26] master could hug you up now
[1:52:35] Hallelujah so it's humility this thing
[1:52:39] we can't be proud about this is a life
[1:52:41] of humility even though you delivered
[1:52:44] you had to be loosed and who loosen you
[1:52:47] not Jesus now but he led the people
[1:52:49] around you all you loose so the word
[1:52:53] coming but you to allow your neighbors
[1:52:56] your fellow brothers to Luci you from
[1:53:00] that
[1:53:03] condition let him
[1:53:06] go now
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:09] Jesus after this when this took place
[1:53:13] you know what happened many
[1:53:17] Jews the scripture said then many of the
[1:53:19] Jews which came to Mary had seen these
[1:53:22] things with Jesus they believed on
[1:53:26] him you know what going on that was on
[1:53:29] the heels of his entry into
[1:53:33] Jerusalem right after that it's gy
[1:53:37] donkey now you see what going on there
[1:53:40] scriptures had to be fulfilled Daughters
[1:53:41] of Zion Hallelujah
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] Rejoice but God had a allow before that
[1:53:51] season he had to get people to believe
[1:53:54] he had to get people to Rejoice he had
[1:53:57] to get people hallelujah animated they
[1:53:59] they had to
[1:54:01] be so what God did the thing look bad it
[1:54:06] look like your loved
[1:54:08] ones dead so we going to lose some loved
[1:54:13] ones just before the
[1:54:17] entry
[1:54:18] Hallelujah
[1:54:21] going to lose some loved ones but God
[1:54:23] has a purpose in it do we understand
[1:54:25] that this
[1:54:26] morning the thing look bad but it's to
[1:54:30] get people to believe because those same
[1:54:33] people had a scale palm trees cut down
[1:54:35] branches show the clothes on the floor
[1:54:38] to welcome that man in
[1:54:43] Hallelujah so that scene there it's St
[1:54:46] Revival in Bethany and Beany was just 2
[1:54:50] miles to
[1:54:51] Jerusalem Hallelujah GL
[1:54:55] Glory so when they singing hosana hosana
[1:54:58] To The
[1:54:59] King D just saying hosana just
[1:55:04] so hosana the
[1:55:06] King Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:55:12] hallelujah
[1:55:14] amen it's a triumphal entry he ain't
[1:55:17] begging for worship now it's Triumph
[1:55:22] Hallelujah there were armies that was
[1:55:25] following
[1:55:26] him glory be to God in
[1:55:29] highest in that first coming was a
[1:55:32] donkey a
[1:55:33] cult but brother we saw in third coming
[1:55:37] brother is a white stallion and there
[1:55:39] were armies following
[1:55:42] him of which we are part of this
[1:55:48] morning so God allowing these dark
[1:55:53] situations for his glory to get people
[1:55:56] to
[1:56:03] believe now we coming to the anointing
[1:56:06] here is after this now where Jesus in
[1:56:11] chapter 12 6 days before the Passover
[1:56:13] came to Bethany where Lazarus was which
[1:56:16] had been this in John 12:1 which
[1:56:20] Lazar where Lazarus which had been dead
[1:56:23] whom he raised from the dead so this was
[1:56:26] just before the feast six days how they
[1:56:28] counting it is in that way so it's just
[1:56:29] the day before the seven day now is
[1:56:31] where you're coming into the feast so is
[1:56:33] around two days there and then the feast
[1:56:37] so the feast coming up the entry coming
[1:56:40] up and here is a little setting in the
[1:56:42] home so you would see uh they show you
[1:56:44] that the house of Simon the leper was
[1:56:48] not too far there from from the house of
[1:56:51] the the tomb of Lazarus all right so in
[1:56:53] that same vicinity there was the house
[1:56:55] of Simon the leopard now we don't want
[1:56:57] to confuse the scripture because this
[1:56:59] anointing this was in the house of Simon
[1:57:03] the
[1:57:05] leper in St Luke chapter 7 there was
[1:57:08] another Simon
[1:57:10] also but he was a
[1:57:14] Pharisee all right not the same Simon it
[1:57:17] was a different Simon and it was a
[1:57:18] different woman
[1:57:20] all right that anointed his feet now the
[1:57:23] woman in chapter 7 in St Luke is the the

[1:58:02] Hallelujah he says Simon I want to ask
[1:58:04] you
[1:58:05] something you have two
[1:58:08] men right there was a creditor vers 41
[1:58:12] Luke 7 ver 41 which had two debtors and
[1:58:15] one owed 500 p and the other one 50 and
[1:58:19] when they had nothing to pay he frankly

[1:58:23] of them will love him the most
[1:58:28] Hallelujah everybody quiet in the
[1:58:32] feast Simon say well I suppose that he
[1:58:35] whom thou forgest most he said unto him

[2:13:08] quickly we're going to we could take it
[2:13:11] from either
[2:13:16] mark
[2:13:19] glory be to God
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:26] in Matthew chapter
[2:13:30] 26 Judas got real trouble with
[2:13:34] that we got to understand it Judas get
[2:13:37] real
[2:13:38] trouble because she anoint head and
[2:13:42] foot and as far as judah's concerned you
[2:13:45] waste
[2:13:46] that
[2:13:51] glory be to
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:57] God Judah say you could have sell that
[2:14:00] and get 300 P of
[2:14:02] [Applause]
[2:14:06] that glory be to God in how we love the
[2:14:10] Lord
[2:14:16] Jesus all right so I want to show you
[2:14:19] this here what took place here
[2:14:21] hallelujah right glory be to God thank
[2:14:24] you Lord
[2:14:26] Jesus so
[2:14:34] hallu
[2:14:39] amen s John same chapter and John all
[2:14:43] right we take it from John 4 John
[2:14:46] 12:4 just sorry for that but look at
[2:14:51] this here this is important for us to
[2:14:53] understand in this season all right
[2:14:56] because um Judas now simonon verse4
[2:15:00] which should be Tri why was not this
[2:15:02] ointment sold for 300 P so he no
[2:15:08] [Applause]
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:10] money he know how much he could have get
[2:15:12] for
[2:15:13] that 300 p and given to the poor
[2:15:18] this said he not that he cared for the
[2:15:20] poor but because he was
[2:15:22] active and had the bag and bear that
[2:15:26] which was put there
[2:15:29] in 300 P now I want us to understand
[2:15:34] something that's a lot of money you
[2:15:37] know one
[2:15:40] pence is like we know the scripture that
[2:15:44] the the laborers went into the the
[2:15:47] vineyard to
[2:15:48] work and their hire was a
[2:15:53] penny right for the day so that word
[2:15:58] Pence is the same penny is a
[2:16:02] Denarius uh
[2:16:04] so you work whole
[2:16:08] day for one
[2:16:11] p Comm on
[2:16:13] sense a whole day pay is one
[2:16:19] p this is 300
[2:16:24] P so that's a whole year
[2:16:28] work that's not just one year working
[2:16:31] when you're working you have bills to
[2:16:32] pay you to eat food they have all
[2:16:35] that so that not a year
[2:16:38] work it's a year work with no money for
[2:16:43] you so that would be really years of
[2:16:46] saving
[2:16:49] to make up 300
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:55] P
[2:16:59] Hallelujah glory be to God in highest it
[2:17:02] costly
[2:17:04] now you know
[2:17:06] what just to show your
[2:17:09] money the Widow went to throw some money
[2:17:13] a day amen and that was called a
[2:17:18] might that's a little cup of coin she
[2:17:20] had two mites there they said that
[2:17:24] might is
[2:17:27] one5
[2:17:29] of the the
[2:17:32] Pence well the Pence is really 15 cents
[2:17:36] and the might is really 1/5 of a
[2:17:40] cent right so one day pay you'll get 15
[2:17:44] cents which is like a pence
[2:17:48] 15 cents is one
[2:17:51] p the might that the Widow putting is
[2:17:55] one fifth of one of those
[2:17:59] 15 and in Jesus's estimation Hallelujah
[2:18:03] when she put that she put more than all
[2:18:05] the rich
[2:18:13] men
[2:18:16] amen she put more than the rich man so
[2:18:19] God is not watching quantity now she
[2:18:23] placed out of her
[2:18:25] abundance she placed out of her needs s
[2:18:29] she had needs you know when we come in
[2:18:31] the church and we putay offering not
[2:18:33] because you have but because you know
[2:18:35] there's a blessing inside of there and
[2:18:38] you have needs and maybe you put in the
[2:18:40] offering and you don't know what going
[2:18:41] to happen tomorrow for the children for
[2:18:44] school but he's still Jehovah Gyra
[2:18:58] amen look at
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:03] this we going over to Matthew how
[2:19:05] Matthew put it chapter 26 the scripture
[2:19:09] says Judas get real trouble with
[2:19:13] that so you see you can't serve God by
[2:19:16] what people feel you should
[2:19:18] do you had to do as you are
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:22] LED amen now look at this
[2:19:28] um Judas now in in Jesus said she did
[2:19:33] this verse 14 in Matthew chapter 26 then
[2:19:38] one of the 12 this Matthew 26 ver 14
[2:19:43] called Judas Iscariot went out so this
[2:19:46] after that feast and that night
[2:19:47] atmosphere and the place smelling up
[2:19:49] Judas and all with with a smell on him
[2:19:52] because that smell don't it don't finish
[2:19:54] you wash it it's still there and if
[2:19:57] you're going B come out smelling
[2:20:00] Smokey right so Judas left with that
[2:20:03] sent on him but it couldn't change
[2:20:08] him the anointing cannot change the
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:14] seed
[2:20:15] hallelujah amen
[2:20:18] he was in the atmosphere of
[2:20:20] it Hallelujah the prophecy is because
[2:20:24] you are seen you could be reborn but
[2:20:26] baptism don't change
[2:20:29] nothing right so when the that Dynamics
[2:20:32] fall and that anointing dropped down
[2:20:35] former and latter R together in the
[2:20:37] first
[2:20:38] month
[2:20:40] tears and we
[2:20:43] rejoicing so it bringing them to
[2:20:45] fullness and it bringing the brighter
[2:20:47] fullness
[2:20:47] [Applause]
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:20:50] just bringing out what inside of you so
[2:20:53] that's why his colors had to show before
[2:20:55] pus right now
[2:20:59] Judas went unto the chief priest so he
[2:21:03] went with the World Council of churches
[2:21:05] there now he have inside information he
[2:21:08] sell
[2:21:09] out and said you know Judas is the one
[2:21:11] on money he said unto them what will you
[2:21:14] give me and I will deliver him unto you
[2:21:17] and they covenanted with him for 30
[2:21:22] pieces of
[2:21:26] silver watch
[2:21:28] this in her
[2:21:30] estimation she took years of saving to
[2:21:34] pour out in one
[2:21:36] [Applause]
[2:21:38] second and Judas watched to reveal word
[2:21:41] for the hour the person of Christ made
[2:21:44] flesh amongst us and sell out for 30
[2:21:48] pieces of
[2:21:50] silver which is just about 3
[2:21:53] months it's just like 30 P then 30 days
[2:21:57] work right so it it really how it work
[2:22:01] out is it's a little more value but just
[2:22:04] let me say a month or two of work
[2:22:07] pay so the value Saints young people
[2:22:12] when you sell out you just always get
[2:22:16] less
[2:22:18] than what the real word
[2:22:23] is right God give us certain things we
[2:22:27] had to preserve young people right your
[2:22:29] Chastity you had to preserve certain
[2:22:31] things when you s out to the devil you
[2:22:35] don't get
[2:22:38] much 30 pieces of silver and this woman
[2:22:42] when she estimate that just
[2:22:45] TR Hallelujah

[2:27:25] energy now that had to be dissipated
[2:27:28] it's like David slinging the sling it's
[2:27:32] energy inside every move he make the
[2:27:35] faster he go more energy Hallelujah so a

[2:27:55] it's a whole nice motion that going on
[2:27:57] there that nobody seeing but he
[2:27:59] functioning and then you need a push now
[2:28:02] these fellas that was in front you now
[2:28:05] they become now the push to push you now
[2:28:08] to go
[2:28:14] forward prayer is important
[2:28:17] so those who were up in front pointing
[2:28:20] upwards now they come behind and they
[2:28:22] pushing you know to go forward so you
[2:28:26] have who was first become last in every
[2:28:28] step in every step who was pointing

[2:28:35] come to church they are the first to be
[2:28:37] here open up they pray they make sure
[2:28:39] everything in order and sometime when
[2:28:41] you look at them they are the last to
[2:28:42] leave
[2:28:43] you people like those are important for
[2:28:46] a Ministry to
[2:28:51] go your labors of love he wouldn't
[2:28:54] [Applause]
[2:28:57] forget
[2:28:59] amen hallelujah so the foot is something
[2:29:03] important God has stabilizers inside
[2:29:05] here now that is where when Mary was at
[2:29:08] Jesus's feet at that
[2:29:11] time those are the same feet that one
[2:29:14] day John saw it F
[2:29:18] brass that will judge the enemies the
[2:29:21] script they talk about he'll trample
[2:29:23] them the
[2:29:23] blood Hallelujah that's the same foot
[2:29:26] know what a privilege it was for her to
[2:29:29] be identified with those feet over there
[2:29:34] Hallelujah those are the same feet that
[2:29:36] will one day stand on the Mount of Zion
[2:29:39] when those feet stand there he will
[2:29:41] surely remember what she did down there
[2:29:43] for
[2:29:45] him
[2:29:48] [Applause]
[2:29:50] Hallelujah so now notice Jesus said
[2:29:54] coming down he said when she did this
[2:29:57] she did it unto my burial amen
[2:30:03] now Jesus's
[2:30:05] burial
[2:30:06] lasted just about two days Friday night
[2:30:11] Saturday he remained in the Tomb by
[2:30:12] Sunday morning he was
[2:30:15] up now for him to the scripture say when
[2:30:19] he understood it so there would be
[2:30:22] things happening God didn't show Jesus
[2:30:23] everything one time The Book of
[2:30:25] Revelation came after the resurrection
[2:30:28] so when he resurrected that Revelation
[2:30:29] was open unto him Adam didn't know he
[2:30:32] was inside of him brother but after God
[2:30:35] put him to sleep and God did an
[2:30:37] operation and took him up that struck
[2:30:39] him he said that is Bor of my bone Flesh
[2:30:41] of
[2:30:42] My it wasn't she was inside of him but
[2:30:44] it wasn't yet revealed amen so Jesus as
[2:30:48] in flesh there are things he didn't know
[2:30:51] all right so he said the day and the
[2:30:53] hour no man know it at that stage he
[2:30:55] didn't
[2:30:56] know save the Father in Heaven All right
[2:31:00] so at that stage when it was revealed
[2:31:03] Jesus watch it now he said wait now
[2:31:06] scriptures had to be fulfilled burial
[2:31:09] coming
[2:31:10] up when he came into the ministry he was
[2:31:14] anointed when he leaving the ministry he
[2:31:16] had to be
[2:31:17] anointed you see is when the thing look
[2:31:20] washed up it's then when God come to
[2:31:25] it Hallelujah and notice David said he
[2:31:29] anointed him in the presence of his
[2:31:30] enemies his C it
[2:31:34] over so you have all those Pharisees and
[2:31:37] all who are wrong and and Mary coming
[2:31:41] out with that ointment inside of there
[2:31:44] you watch for the prophet to go west
[2:31:46] where it came from sixth year dreams
[2:31:49] came from where among the
[2:31:52] body dreams from inside of the church
[2:31:56] Hallelujah a bunch of spirit filled
[2:31:58] people hallelujah brother Junior Jackson
[2:32:01] wasn't among them but you have dreams
[2:32:03] that came from putting it as he bright
[2:32:04] body de that could have given him the
[2:32:08] assurance and the inspiration to go
[2:32:13] forward so this thing is not about just
[2:32:16] come into church and get a nice message
[2:32:19] you got to be connected you had to be
[2:32:21] following something you walking with
[2:32:23] your sacrifice your amens help the
[2:32:26] minister what you do for the ministry it
[2:32:29] goes a long
[2:32:31] way your word of advice what you going
[2:32:34] through in your life brother it is those
[2:32:37] things will be Milestones Jesus said
[2:32:40] this thing here wherever the gospel is
[2:32:42] preached it will be a memorial of her so
[2:32:47] you see because where we at now is the
[2:32:49] bright coming of
[2:32:50] [Applause]
[2:32:52] Christ what he highlight is a
[2:32:55] bride he is
[2:32:59] here a memorial is a great thing you
[2:33:02] know when you look Memorial he say I am
[2:33:05] that name I am will be the memorial for
[2:33:08] all
[2:33:10] generations so when you hear Memorial is
[2:33:12] more things that God did when all you
[2:33:14] cross the Jordan 12 Stones that will be
[2:33:17] a
[2:33:21] memorial all right feast days blowing a
[2:33:24] trumpet's
[2:33:26] memorial take some Stones put it on the
[2:33:29] ephod of the the high
[2:33:31] priest your name is written there every
[2:33:34] time you going to the holies of holies
[2:33:35] you locked up there it's a
[2:33:40] memorial and in all those memorials in
[2:33:43] the
[2:33:45] scripture Jesus choose to take this
[2:33:47] thing here what this woman did as a
[2:33:51] memorial for all generation wherever
[2:33:54] this gospel is preached what she did
[2:33:56] brother will be
[2:34:00] mentioned
[2:34:02] Hallelujah that
[2:34:04] Memorial so you you have a part to play
[2:34:07] in your ministry Hallelujah God is what
[2:34:10] and and when you watch the prophet there
[2:34:12] he went and he connect with these angels
[2:34:15] uh it was something for the church and
[2:34:18] Jesus now that anointing there at that
[2:34:20] time was unto burial but we no longer at
[2:34:24] burial Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[2:34:27] and different ones came with
[2:34:29] anointing later on they came with M and
[2:34:33] all these things to anoint the body of
[2:34:35] Jesus spices and he gone
[2:34:39] already so the thing that she did that
[2:34:42] was the time to do it so sometime you
[2:34:45] think no I wait we had the Dead first
[2:34:47] anoint to
[2:34:50] die they wait until they waited until
[2:34:53] that time that was a waste of
[2:34:56] money not what she did
[2:34:59] there you see so it's understanding the
[2:35:03] will of God for your life present
[2:35:06] tense when the spirit move on you it's
[2:35:09] then brother you had to give open up
[2:35:12] your
[2:35:13] BS Hallelujah
[2:35:19] Hallelujah so at that time she came to
[2:35:22] the Cornerstone but where we are now is
[2:35:26] Capstone in this Capstone time if there
[2:35:29] was a if there was a bride there at the
[2:35:33] Cornerstone to anoint him for that
[2:35:35] season there what about up here in The
[2:35:39] Headstone it must have a pride also
[2:35:42] there must be a Ministry also that
[2:35:45] willing to give up the all Hallelujah
[2:35:49] for the uniting of that
[2:35:54] headstone
[2:35:57] hallelujah
[2:35:59] [Applause]
[2:36:01] amen it's God taking us into
[2:36:04] something when that Mighty angel came
[2:36:07] down Hallelujah you see because what we
[2:36:10] we worshiping no
[2:36:13] man no man because if Mary came to Peter
[2:36:18] foot feet he would have
[2:36:21] run Jesus came to watch Peter he said no
[2:36:24] I Ain worthy Lord Peter know his
[2:36:26] position Cornelius went and he bow down
[2:36:29] because Cornelius prayers went up before
[2:36:31] God as a memorial and Cornelius came and
[2:36:34] he B down at Peter Peter's feet and
[2:36:36] Peter pull him up he
[2:36:37] said do
[2:36:42] that Paul and they they lift him up as
[2:36:45] Gods he said no we are men have like
[2:36:47] passions just like you
[2:36:49] all John fell on to worship the angel in
[2:36:53] Revelation he said no don't do that he
[2:36:57] said I am thy fellow
[2:37:04] servant so we are worshiping nor man nor
[2:37:08] man is of Glory all glory deserves goes
[2:37:12] to almighty
[2:37:14] God
[2:37:21] Hallelujah now
[2:37:24] watch we could receive little
[2:37:28] roses the prophet say I rather give you
[2:37:30] a rose while you're life than a rich
[2:37:31] when you're dead so some brother after
[2:37:34] the prophet message he said brother
[2:37:36] Grandma I appreciate that message and he
[2:37:38] very you know he compliment him and the
[2:37:41] prophet said
[2:37:42] TKS man watching say watch at you and
[2:37:46] the prophet said the only thing about it
[2:37:48] is that I truthful with it I glad for
[2:37:51] what he said you know so a little
[2:37:53] compliment here and there is we can take
[2:37:55] that but when it comes to
[2:38:00] worship we can't take
[2:38:03] that you see because it's not the man
[2:38:07] but it's the
[2:38:08] angel on the platform what open those
[2:38:11] scenes William
[2:38:13] brandom there was an angel that on that
[2:38:16] platform every night to open up that
[2:38:20] se so
[2:38:24] is it's something we coming into that
[2:38:27] headstone into that Capstone in this
[2:38:29] hour there is a bride that have what it
[2:38:32] takes you see because the two Ministries
[2:38:34] had to be alike so we not you see
[2:38:37] because Revelation 10 we closing we
[2:38:41] closing Revelation 10 when that Mighty
[2:38:44] angel came down that wasn't no seventh
[2:38:46] angel in Hallelujah that was the mighty
[2:38:49] angel that was Christ he came down
[2:38:51] clothing in a cloud little book open in
[2:38:53] his hand you see Mary's anointing was
[2:38:56] for the lamb that was going to be slain
[2:39:00] but now he's no longer lamb this El lion
[2:39:03] Hallelujah there is a Mary here tonight
[2:39:06] this morning
[2:39:10] Hallelujah now it's open book
[2:39:14] time
[2:39:19] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[2:39:21] lion Ro it when he cried seven Thunders
[2:39:23] after the voice and John was about to
[2:39:24] write he said no don't write it seal it
[2:39:27] up don't but he heard it so this
[2:39:30] Thunders is not to make
[2:39:32] books and write up seal it
[2:39:36] up there's Mysteries containing in that
[2:39:38] word that would be revealed brother in
[2:39:41] due
[2:39:43] time there are Mysteries outside we saw
[2:39:47] on the outside of the pyramid there were
[2:39:49] things up on seed and Holy Ghost without
[2:39:52] sensation and a lot of mysteries on the
[2:39:55] outside the prophet was interpreting but
[2:39:57] when you lift up that cap in the pyramid
[2:40:00] now and you going inside there now is
[2:40:02] things that light never shown on
[2:40:05] before those things now you got to be
[2:40:07] caught up here in the Capstone to get a
[2:40:11] revelation of what is inside of
[2:40:13] you all right Hallelujah so if the
[2:40:17] prophet had to be caught up don't you
[2:40:19] think that God want to take us up
[2:40:21] also to see things about our because the
[2:40:24] prophet inside of there saw his
[2:40:27] life he was going he was wondering could
[2:40:30] this be he was he didn't know what it
[2:40:32] was Hallelujah but then when he reached
[2:40:36] inside the book became a new
[2:40:39] book he said met the one with the seven
[2:40:41] seal he said the thing I wanted all my
[2:40:43] life it bring a certain finality and
[2:40:46] wrap up lucens in even in his
[2:40:51] [Music]
[2:40:53] life now notice
[2:40:55] here there are mysteries on the outside
[2:40:58] the Mysteries would be finished but The
[2:40:59] Voice verse 8 in Revelation 10 verse 8
[2:41:01] The Voice which I heard from Heaven
[2:41:03] spake unto me and said go now you John
[2:41:06] don't go to the seventh angel now but go
[2:41:09] up to the Angel that's right which
[2:41:11] standed upon the sea and upon the Earth
[2:41:14] dominion over all things

[2:41:18] up to him
[2:41:20] now when he CED do voice but you go to
[2:41:28] him you see the junction we
[2:41:31] yet God calling us into a personal walk
[2:41:34] with Christ and that's where the word
[2:41:36] taking us now because there's a Time
[2:41:39] coming where John he that book and he
[2:41:42] said thou must prophesy
[2:41:44] again there's a manifestation coming of
[2:41:48] this Bri and that was the final thing
[2:41:50] before the turn into Revelation 11 where
[2:41:53] go tribulation period to deal with the
[2:41:56] 144,000 the last thing before there thou

[3:01:42] request
[3:01:44] this is from Sister suzan dunda good
[3:01:47] morning SC just want to thank God for
[3:01:48] his Blessing and for experiencing his
[3:01:50] true word and this is an interesting
[3:01:53] note of Praise You know she wrote this
[3:01:55] not knowing what but ad was going to
[3:01:57] speak on and she said one of my
[3:01:59] experiences I had was being blessed with
[3:02:01] a raise in my salary which I didn't even
[3:02:03] know and it was $10 more added to my
[3:02:06] salary and it was a blessing to me
[3:02:07] because I was paying my ti more than my
[3:02:09] salary income so when my boss said to me
[3:02:12] she added more money to my salary I knew
[3:02:14] it was God's blessing she didn't even
[3:02:15] know it was
[3:02:17] coming so the more you give to the Lord
[3:02:20] is the more that he will bless you so
[3:02:21] the sister is giving God thanks for that
[3:02:24] and this is a note of Praise from sister
[3:02:26] kangali I saw her downstairs I was like
[3:02:27] what are you doing here I told you'd be
[3:02:30] home resting she was in the hospital
[3:02:31] almost for the entire day on Friday and
[3:02:33] you said thank God for his goodness and
[3:02:35] mercy towards me thank the Saints for
[3:02:37] their prayers on my behalf thank God for
[3:02:38] my healing and she's in the house of the
[3:02:40] Lord this morning so we are thankful to

[3:02:47] things amen and our precious brother
[3:02:50] Anne God bless the Breen today and may

[3:03:00] and thank everyone for their love I know
[3:03:02] he wasn't feeling well and he says

[3:03:38] us that if two shall agree touching
