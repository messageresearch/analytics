[53:21] the animals existed in peace and harmony
[53:24] even nature itself was at peace can we
[53:27] say man a man and God was proud of his
[53:33] son God is no longer el him he is no

[54:31] death on this side there was no way to
[54:34] get back across
[54:37] notice he said on one side of the chasm
[54:40] he's a son of God and offspring of God
[54:43] and earlier he can control nature he can
[54:47] speak things into existence he is a
[54:50] creator but on the other side he is
[54:54] separated from his sonship he's a sinner
[54:56] by Nature and he is under the Dominion
[54:59] of Satan my sorry man it's like when a
[55:04] country conquers and captures another
[55:06] country and they honk off the king and

[55:51] condemnation so Adam is now running away
[55:55] from God and hiding in the garden my god
[55:58] sin brings death the wages of sin is
[56:02] death my sin causes Adam to lose his
[56:06] inheritance as a son my god a man in
[56:10] other words he lost his sonship he lost
[56:13] his courtship he lost his authority over
[56:16] the earth because he was cut off from
[56:18] Papa Gori man hallelujah hallelujah
[56:22] my god he is no longer in the likeness
[56:27] of God still a son but now has a
[56:31] different nature a sinful nature of
[56:36] carnal human spirit fallen man nature
[56:40] which no longer qualifies him as fit to
[56:44] rule and so the authority is taken away
[56:47] from him my Amen it was right there that
[56:54] man whose purpose was to rule and to
[56:57] have dominion over here it was right
[57:00] there when he sinned that he lost the
[57:02] title a score of beer and Satan became
[57:05] known as the god of this world amen he
[57:10] stole a title he stole the authority he
[57:14] was self-appointed a man amen
[57:17] his authority was not given from God

[1:10:15] sin was wiped off he was justified
[1:10:18] before God but he still had a sinful
[1:10:21] nature he was forgiven
[1:10:25] justified but a fallen nature was still
[1:10:28] resident in him therefore he did not
[1:10:32] qualify to access the authority that was
[1:10:35] given to him by his father no more can
[1:10:38] we say man Adam could not speak to the
[1:10:43] lion he better run for his life
[1:10:46] because he lacked the dominion over the
[1:10:48] beasts of the field over the house of
[1:10:52] the air over nature over the elements
[1:10:56] Adam was driven out of the garden as a
[1:10:59] sign of the disconnect with his father
[1:11:02] as a sign that he had lost as an
[1:11:04] innocent inheritance as a son my a man
[1:11:09] glory and in the temporary absence of
[1:11:13] the master of the earth Satan begins to
[1:11:15] squat earlier and poses a score of this

[1:12:13] the sons of God by making sure listen
[1:12:17] that it would never come to know who
[1:12:20] they are so he inflicts them with
[1:12:24] spiritual amnesia well you forget who

[1:12:47] lust of the eyes pride of life at you to
[1:12:51] keep you off the right path hallelujah
[1:12:54] he reforms your mind to study selfish
[1:12:57] goals and ambitions like Adam dared a
[1:13:00] man instead of fulfilling what your
[1:13:04] father wants amen that's the devil other
[1:13:08] he's a good adversary a man but what
[1:13:13] about the father do you think that God
[1:13:16] would leave the earth which is his
[1:13:18] footstool to be stolen by an imposter no
[1:13:23] amen do you think he would give up on
[1:13:26] his son hallelujah praise God look at
[1:13:30] the story of the prodigal son and his
[1:13:32] father the Bible said when he was afar
[1:13:35] off his father saw him and ran out to

[1:13:41] looking out for his son hoping and
[1:13:43] praying at URI

[1:13:50] never gave up on his son he was rooting
[1:13:54] down over yet

[1:14:00] one day get back his memory of who he is
[1:14:03] and who his father is and where he came
[1:14:06] from a gold of God a man
[1:14:10] like a big mother Eagle son you don't

[1:14:41] prophets to preach salvation to keep him
[1:14:44] on the right path
[1:14:45] he sent preachers but then one day when
[1:14:50] he wanted to project the fullness of his
[1:14:52] love to his son and to redeem him right
[1:14:56] back to eating again
[1:14:57] he left the portals of glory and slipped
[1:15:01] into a time body condescended to the
[1:15:04] human race and paid the ransom price the
[1:15:09] ultimate price of death for sin the
[1:15:12] shedding of his very own blood

[1:16:22] is remembering British goddess memories
[1:16:24] coming back
[1:16:25] disparate Arab leaders leaving gradually
[1:16:28] a man lorry but a father is looking at
[1:16:33] this kind of nature still resident in
[1:16:36] his son he cannot release the authority
[1:16:40] because he saw what hadn't would happen
[1:16:43] with Adam it will not happen again
