opportunity i want to greet all the ministers across the globe who are going to speak in this meetings praise god god we should bless you for your love and for your support [Music] at this time because we need this at this time as well of christ words of encouragement to positionally place us in this trying and terrible times on the earth amen i want to appreciate the headstone time knuckle in trinidad with all of it and the team amen isaac praise god god we should bless you for your support and for all that you're doing for the bride of christ across the globe amen so god richard bless you um i just want i won't take my time just read the scripture to support or put my heart to the wheel on this inspiration for the meetings praise god so if you can open with me to romans chapter 8 verse 18 paul said for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared what to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so there's going to be a glory revealed in us amen so all the sufferings all that you're going through the difficult things you're going through now amen there is a glory ahead and the the the blessing or the the the might of that glory is greater than the suffering you're going through soon and very soon we're gonna be like him we're gonna walk like him talk like him speak like him and that is the glory that paul was talking about no no no no condition no plague on this earth can be compared with that glory and we are certainly pressing on towards that mark to receive that glory amen verse 19 there is therefore the endless expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god hallelujah and that's what all the creation is waiting for going back to eden just like a true son of god born in the image of god praise god god bless you amen hallelujah may the lord bless the written of his word amen wherever you are you may be seated so we thank god that we have an assurance paul said there's a glory that is going to be revealed in us that the evil has not seen before nothing in this world can be compared with that glory amen satan will bring all plagues will bring all challenges but it's a glory that is going to be revealed in us and i'm looking at the glory i'm not looking at my condition the plagues on this earth the situation i'm going through my trials my troubles my thirst it is fine but i know that's a blessed assurance there's a glory going to be revealed that is greater than all this and the anus of creation the animals the trees praise god they are all in expectation that a child of god will come to that glory will come to that manifestation and when we get to that manifestation oh praise be to god the bible said it puts us back into speaking conditions we're going to speak like adam's book in the garden when you speak god will back you up hallelujah and that condition can only come when the son of god is manifested when you are adopted amen that means god trusts you whatever you say is the mind of god you cannot say anything that god hasn't said jesus said except i see my father do it so i do and when the man comes to that manifestation of a son of god you don't you don't speak a mess you speak what the father has bid you to say praise god hallelujah was saying here in the adoption tape 1962 adoption part 4 the prophet said tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the son of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now oh this is the time for the manifestation this is the hour this is the moment there can never be any other time than this time so tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now then when were there ever a time in the history oh praise god it couldn't have happened in luther's time it would have happened in wesley's time it couldn't happen in abraham's time he had a full taste of it but this is the full manifestation of a son of god adapted please son of god so when when there ever was a time in the history he said this that manifest the time to deliver all nature also our time to deliver our own nature and put the whole creation grown it and travail it for this deliverance the land is travailing the tiger is travailing the trees are travailing they want to be delivered and god has prepared sense oh hallelujah that he got trust he have he's put his trust in these sons praise god put power in the sounds put authority in the sands and these sons of god are going to deliver praise god nature amen so the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation so why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations oh praise god they couldn't have happened in a time amen in the old testament there could not be in this manifestation ram said it had to wait till this time oh what a moment so bride of christ our time is the greatest moment oh it's the golden age amen that's why the devil is plaguing us with all sorts of things on this end all tough conditions all difficult conditions they are plagues praise god oh but god is making a way hmm oh the devil cannot stop us we have a hope that one day we would walk like him talk like him speak like him you'll have the signature of papa amen when you sign the bank cannot refuse you because you have the authority to sign oh hallelujah amen so the prophet said here before the holy ghost was ever poured out before the old testament down there there couldn't have been manifestation they had to wait till this time now all things have been brought coming shaping up to a headstone oh praise god you see it so we are shaping up into what the headstone to the manifestation of sons of god coming back hallelujah oh another son of god back on the earth again coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men oh praise be to god not a church spirit not some group spirit not some organizational spirit but we are going to move with that spirit of god if that same spirit that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwells in you oh my god it's gonna have a quickening in this mortal body and that's what we are receiving in this adoption season the dynamic the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ oh you see it oh my so every individual i will have a ministry you'll be like christ so close like christ till it will join him and his church together oh there's a prophecy now oh my so just to encourage you amen those that have joined those meetings and this convention don't give up amen this plague is just for a season there's a glory going to be revealed in us and that's what i just read we're going to have the spirit of christ jesus in us come and confirm that this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell hear ye him oh glory be to god when you speak god will back you off when you speak he will back you up church oh glory be to god amen oh man let me read just just this last one here in the serpent seed the prophet said god hid it from the eyes of the wise and the prudent you see it this manifestation of the son of god it doesn't come by reading just the quotes no it's a god hear it from the wise and the prudent oh hallelujah it's a revelation a secret and promised to reveal it to the sons of god in the last days so this adoption perfection manifestation oh my god himself walking on two feet on the air he hid it from the wise and the prudent so when the sons of god were made manifest when god's sons start rejected with that rejoice with him before the foundation of the well when the great revelation of the godhead and the things will be brought down into the last days he would manifest these things to the sons of god not to anybody but towards the sons of god so you know that scripture teaches that and in the browser and here we are that's the reason that god is opening these things to us god is bringing his sons into manifestations oh church amen our time is right speak and go forward god is bringing his sons into what manifestations he's going beyond the limitation of human knowledge oh i love what the prophet said or adoption goes beyond the manifestation of human knowledge human cannot understand it it goes beyond the limitation of human knowledge when you try to figure it out you make a mistake why did god do this for this why did god choose this one oh my he did it according to the good pleasure of his will to bring this one to that manifestation or to adapt to you oh to make himself manifest in you he's going beyond the limitation of human knowledge way into the spiritual revelations and bringing it down oh praise god so don't be afraid when they question you say you don't know it's by grace don't be afraid to speak amen so god we shall bless you amen god bless you man of christ across the globe may god bless us this weekend as we enjoy the virtual convention i know it's going to be a double portion of what we had in in july on the on the inspiration at the time of life amen when god promised abraham that abraham i'm returning back to you at the time of life amen and abraham had to get his house in order you have to believe this prophecy and hold on amen and the time of life came and truly sarah was pregnant oh hallelujah amen and the son of son was made manifest after the time of life a son was made manifest was that isaac was made manifest and we are in another manifestation oh after the time of life what are we waiting for a manifestation of a son of god oh can the devil stop this it happened in the natural sahara went through the time of life and there was a manifestation of a son and we have gone through the time of life in the spiritual oh there has to be a manifestation of a son god has to manifest himself

hallelujah praise lord bride of christ it is indeed a great privilege to be able to address you at this time via this platform i want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ from new york city i am pastor jesse robledo from the original faith gospel tabernacle i am delighted uh that i am part of this virtual convention and to me it's just a great privilege and an honor times have changed and we know that we are living in very unusual times but through it all god has been so good to us and we certainly do appreciate his blessings that has been with us that has been with our people been with our families and one thing when a man has the baptism of the holy ghost he doesn't walk by what he sees he doesn't walk by how he feels amen he is hooked into the word of god for the word will defeat satan anytime time any place under any condition so i'm delighted for uh the invitation given me by brother solomon nachina i believe that's how it's pronounced i trust that i did not uh mispronounce that but uh i want to send greetings to brother solomon and the church the great uh life tabernacle church and i believe it's called tamale ghana special greetings from new york on behalf of my wife and church people want to know how is new york doing by the grace of god we are alive and well and we are looking for the coming of the lord amen and that is the hope that that lies within us that we have a reason to look for forward to tomorrow the next week amen until the lord comes we will continue to work in the vineyard amen doing all that we can amen to put our shoulders to the wheel in such a convention like this be it virtual be it in person no matter what we are here to be a blessing to one another we certainly do uh miss seeing your happy faces your smiling faces and i'm still after several months on line trying to uh connect up of course with the zoom platform and various means uh through the websites and so forth it's still very difficult to preach to computer hardware it certainly is it doesn't it just doesn't respond i am kind of feeling it is better to preach the hard cases live in the church than it is to preach to computer hardware but nevertheless we are alive and well and i want to greet each and every one no matter uh wherever you are going to be listening from whether it's europe africa around the world south america north america amen our god is uh an awesome god and this gospel we know has reached the further point the furthest points of the earth and we know that is a sign that when the gospel reaches the ends of the earth then the end certainly will come i want to thank uh once again and great brother uh solomon for having me have this opportunity i am delighted i'm a little late in getting this video over to the team in trinidad i do apologize but i trust that i'm not too late so here goes my sermon and my remarks it's very difficult to show any kind of emotion behind a desk and we have been doing so for the last several months but god i believe is opening uh an avenue opening a door for us to return to our respective churches and to once again resume services and i'm just feeling in my heart that once we return it will not be long friends i believe is a time for our families i believe is a time for our loved ones uh because see god always sends his warning before judgment see and we realize that the world as it exists today cannot continue it is impossible uh the world sees it just in a panic stricken state it is certainly uh shows the signs that the end is near but while the end is nearing we could talk a long time about the things of the world and what's happening but we're not here to do that amen brother braham said we can talk about how bad the world is getting but let's focus in also let's uh also mention what how powerful the church is getting all along amen so we thank god for his grace and we know that everything that is taking place in the world today is for a reason it has strengthened our faith it has rededicated our uh lives to the word and we are more faithful now than we have been before knowing that if god can take us through this storm he certainly can take us through uh storms to come so i want to also excuse me take this opportunity to thank the technical team in trinidad uh i know it's not easy their their work in the background to make sure that the tapes in the videos are spliced together and also the translators who are working behind the scenes to translate the messages into various different languages so as many people can understand it could understand it so we appreciate all those uh they have put their uh shoulder to the wheel to make this uh happen so we salute the technical team in trinidad god richly bless you and all those that are behind the scenes i understand that as i said we could have a a face-to-face meeting it has its challenges but a virtual meeting also has its challenges it's time zones and things when is it when is it good for people to view it so nevertheless we are happy to share our testimony from new york city of what god is doing here and i trust that god has kept you safe and blessed in the lord wherever you are and may god continue to bless you and protect you amen as we move forward because we know as i said it is uh not too long uh now to the rapture so we thank the lord god bless every single one technician the translators and everyone who would be listening i like how brother branham back in 1965 uh he was uh that new technology had come in with the phone hookup and he was greeting the people uh in the east greetings from uh indiana to tucson to out in california and their group who are waiting for the coming of the lord new york connecticut and their pastors and their group who are waiting for the coming of the lord and i like that i could say the same thing wherever you are in europe amen in asia in south america wherever it may be africa those that are waiting and looking for the coming of the lord we greet you we salute you amen and we pray that god would say something during these services that would be a blessing to you to your churches and if you trust and pray that if you're defeated in your life or the struggles of these this world has gotten you down to a point where you are no longer one to come to church and you are a little discouraged you're full of fear i pray that god the holy spirit would speak something to our hearts and to encourage us to boost our faith knowing that god is in control praise the lord so we greet you as i said from new york city on behalf of the original faith gospel tabernacle we are so delighted to participate amen uh during this virtual meeting so god bless you i do not want to keep you too long i always say that i always say it to my church and sadly most of the times i am wrong in my target my stop time i trust that i could uh just be an hour or so and i know your time is valuable and uh i trust that something would be set here today that would be a blessing to you amen um just before i get started because i have a tendency of forgetting to give my little message a title i want to title it for these few uh moments tried unto perfection by the word tried unto perfection by the word may the lord had a blessing now as we read the scriptures these scriptures may god add a blessing to the scriptures reading to uh from psalms 105 and we will also be reading from habakkuk psalms 105 i trust everyone as well whether you are listening in the comfort of your home or your job wherever it is amen uh feel free to worship the lord amen we're preaching to believers who are waiting for the coming of the lord psalms 105 and remember thy title tried unto perfection by the word as we get right to our subject and we don't want to drag the time on because we want to save time and make sure that we don't overdo it psalms 105 and we'll start with verse 17 he sent the man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him and that is where i got my inspiration for a title until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him so we realize that by the grace of almighty god we have been called elected predestinated called out of laodicea from every walk of life from denominations from false churches from interpretations from the highways and byways and we're not called simply to just attend a church our calling has purpose our calling has uh there's a reason why god has called you and we trust and pray that by the time this service is through that we would understand that everything is pre-planned your destiny is pre-planned and your destination see predestination has already uh a destination pre-planned for you and i and the theme of these meetings is adoption uh perfection the placing of sons which we have spoken about so many times before but we know that this time is the dispensation of adoption no other age had that dispensation even only when brother branham come on the scene was it time for the manifestation of the sons of god that was a dispensation that was predestinated for our time so if we recognize our message and our day then we can benefit amen from the promises that god has in store for us so we will be speaking on joseph because i wanted to bring it from uh adoption but from the perspective of joseph and his life and how he was tried and he had to mature during his uh days of trying amen and nothing was out of order everything was predestinated exactly how god had written it before the foundation of the world we're just living out our part that has already been uh predestinated for us to live by so i trust that the comfort of knowing that amen that we cannot be lost if we have the seed of god in us and god has baptized us with the holy ghost amen what is in us the spirit of god is zoe that's the life of god and we can no more die than god himself can die amen we are eternal creatures we come from god and we go back to god again what an assurance for the believer but now until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him turn with me to havoc i'm sure you are familiar with this scripture amen and because it speaks of a vision so if i would just back up a little bit joseph growing up he was a spiritual young man he saw visions he dreamed dreams not only did he see visions and dream dreams he could interpret visions and dreams and so forth so he was a spiritual uh man and brother branham said that joseph represents the spirit phil church and that is what i am speaking about tonight uh is joseph rep is is the spirit-filled church i'm not speaking about any particular uh i don't want people to think uh anything we're speaking about the church the spirit-filled church the church that has been been in bondage for many years amen but now coming to perfection she's been tried by the word amen in every trial is dissent for a reason we all have trials but yet our trials may differ from person to person because our trials are custom designed uh for us as individuals because the other person may not like be lacking in the character that you are lacking the other person may not have the character that you have etc so god has custom designed these trials amen to bring us to one place and that place is perfection by the word so now let us read habakkuk chapter 2 and verse 2 and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tablet that he may run that readeth amen for the vision is yet for an appointed time so you see joseph's vision was for an appointed time he could have had those dreams every night but yet they would not have come to pass until the appointed time but he kept the vision and this is what is important for us to understand catch the vision and stick with the vision we shall come to perfection we shall be adopted we shall be filled with the holy ghost that is the bride's prophetic vision and it's gonna take some time the vision will not take place until an appointed time let us read verse three again for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry amen wait for it and thank god we are waiting for every divine promise that has been left uh us by this precious prophet of malachi 4 this is the pure word that has been restored unto us we now have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication so uh though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come and it will not tarry i like that one part says um though it tarry wait for it and the other part says because it will surely come and it will not tarry amen may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads in a word of prayer and if you any of us have any of you out there have a request in your heart whether you are sick in body whether you need a spiritual deliverance whatever it is that you have need of god is able here in the local church during the last several months we've had some special requests people uh uh kneeling in death uh door uh somebody who was in a coma for several uh after having an accident and a young man was in a coma the doctor didn't know what he would make it and the church prayed and miraculously by the grace of god day after day after day he became better and better amen and we have seen so many different requests during this time see we should be praying more we're home i'm not home i'm working but uh every day those of you who are home don't waste your time but take advantage of it get closer to god amen read your bibles and read the spoken word books because see uh we're going to need these uh the word being in us this weapon and the word what did god give us is the greatest weapon he gave us himself and he is the word and the word will defeat satan anytime anyplace under any condition and we if god is with us then who can be against us so let's bow our heads if you have a request if you have unspoken requests you need deliverance you need a job and we're realizing during this economic time and uncertainty many many many thousands have lost their jobs worldwide and they are crying out to the lord for a great change in that god will give them the mercy and grace to be able to provide for their families and this is not just a local situation that has taken place here in the united states it's all over so many people are challenged financially challenged uh daily through with their health and everything else but we want to ask uh god to give us favor amen and if we ask earnestly god is able to answer prayer let us bow our heads in the word of prayer our father we come before you this evening lord and we ask you father for your grace and your mercy you promise oh god that you uh if we would cry to you and and ask earnestly oh for the prayer of the righteous man the earnest prayer of the righteous man availeth much and if your people are praying in the north in the south and east in the west dear god surely we will hear from heaven so i pray dear god that whatever their request may be whether it be healing whether it be deliverance whether it be for a loved one whether it be for a job someone's looking for a job i pray dear god that you would grant it lord anoint our faith that we may believe be able to believe and grab a hold of the promised word not just intellectually lord but with faith that would grab the word and apply it to our lives and know that it belongs to us so i pray dear god that you would bless these few words that will be spoken to your people and i pray that lord that when it's all over may our hearts be warmed by the holy spirit and lord surely testify like those that were walking lord with you on the way to emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as he appeared to them on the road oh as he the word uh fellowship with them oh god we ask you that it will fellowship with us this afternoon we ask in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you amen tried unto perfection by the word amen so this subject i could take some time on this subject because it's a subject that never really gets out of season it never gets old because we are tried and we are tested every day the problem is is how we interpret sometimes the trials that come our way many times people think that well everything is going wrong and god is angry with me everything is going wrong because this has never happened to me but we realize that our trials are more precious than gold amen everything that we go through has a specific purpose to bring out a specific purpose in our lives so we are thankful that the word is trying us even in this year 2020 2020 has been a real trying year for many around the world amen but by the grace of god here we are we're still praising the lord we're still thanking god amen so getting back to the fame of the meeting adoption and the manifestation of the sons of god being positionally placed amen where god wants us to be for years we have wandered and wonder where we should uh what we should be we cannot be self-appointed god has positionally placed some apostles some teachers some evangelists amen for the perfecting other saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ that is not your choice that's god's choice and god elects each and every person to a specific office according to his grace and his mercy to you now of course not everybody is in fifo ministry you have the laities you have the helps and governments and so forth and but everybody in my uh humble opinion and my travels that have traveled over the years it seems like everybody wants to be apostle this apostle that and they want you to really recognize their title that uh they themselves gave themselves apostle this apostle that i cannot tell you the amount of letters i i receive amen with and then signed off by apostle this an apostle that nobody wants to be a pastor nobody wants to be an evangelist nobody wants to be a teacher as it were or or pastor nobody wants to be they want to be an apostle sin but see god is a person god is the supernatural being that places those gifts in the church and when he places those gifts in the church he also vindicates it the same see we cannot make it up it's got to be god amen doing it so oh how our god is desiring to finally see the church find her rightful position where he could use her in the way that he used his own son jesus christ and we realized that uh as i have frequently told our church that jesus had a will you see and we are to follow the will of god so when we uh are praying jesus prayed in the garden when he was about to be crucified the burden was heavy and he said lord if it's possible let this cup pass from me that was jesus the human part the human element of god that was in jesus he was praying because he knew the pain that was awaiting him he knew the sacrifice that he had to make but he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done amen so when we submit our will to his will amen then god can truly use us because we're not seeking our own uh objective our own motives or things like that we are following in the will of god and we how god desires to have the church in perfect harmony in position not one trying to take the other one's place amen pushing them out of the way they just can't wait for that one to make a mistake for them to knock them off their position so they can take over people criticizing one another running one another down and yet we claim that we are ready for the rapture i say not friends because any material any message that does not encourage you to bear the fruits of the spirit amen it's the incorrect message no one this message never taught us how to hate this message never taught us how to backbite and hate our brothers and sisters no we learned that from somewhere else not this message amen this message is a message of love and grace amen and brother branham said nothing but perfect love will make it to the other side so therefore if we ever hope and pray to get to the other side one thing we have to have is charity charity amen uh is the love of god amen charity is perfect so that's what we're striving for by the grace of god so we're on the eve i believe in this dispensation of the manifestation of the sons of god amen and god is going to display a church display his god called men his glorious church that has been uh cast aside for years and years and years and yet she is growing unto perfection see nothing i'm gonna tell you something right now nothing will be able to stop that which has already been spoken there shall be a bride there shall be the manifestation of the sons of god amen you wait to them thunders utter their voices to that group that can take the word and hand it there amen it'll slice and cut and so forth of course we have preached that amen these are seeds to preach but one day amen at the appointed time all of this will be manifested it won't take long it won't be long it won't last long but it will be here because he said it would be amen so therefore this word is already vindicated in my uh humble opinion that's just the way i believe it a simple keep it simple i believe it that way but when we inject our interpretations when we inject our own ideas about it and expect everyone else to follow your idea then that is when we are getting off the word so we realize that it's going to take a special kind of people a special kind of of a breed see it's going to take a special kind of people who can walk alone with god and not be influenced uh by the outside world or the pressures of the church we realize here not only is there pressures on the outside world but pressures in the church there are too many people sadly even pastors who who are respecters of other men in the church they're fearful to speak truth because they're afraid maybe their deacon board may not agree with what it is that they are preaching and they will water the thing down and they don't have the faith to step out and say what god told them to say amen has thus saith the lord but god those days are over because the manifestations of the sons of god this is the time and these individuals will walk alone with god and if we ever expect to uh get anywhere church it is an individual affair and yet it's not that we are isolating ourselves from anyone else the word comes by revelation and if it comes it came to peter it came to paul it came to all the apostles by revelation and i'm very uh happy when i read the bible when paul said i never went to jerusalem and was never taught this by man he went to arabia so who taught paul amen the gospel of jesus christ it was the holy spirit amen that taught paul the gospel and when he finally saw the other brethren amen not having seen each other in the flesh they agreed with one another and they had fellowship under the word of god and you see this is what is going to bring the true unity of the faith not an intellectual understanding but a genuine revelation of the word amen every word amen and that is what brings and keeps the unity of the faith and every man in their position humble walking humbly before god not boastful not blessed god charlie one man show no no no no see but they will stand on their convictions and they walk alone so now brother branham said in a message here jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said uh in this time jesus had done great things in these early days in his early ministry he was misunderstood as most everyone did you ever come to think of it that most men who ever do anything great for the kingdom of god stands alone any person that amounts to anything and does anything great for the kingdom of god stands alone did you ever think of it see you have to stand by yourself jesus stood alone and all down through the ages other men who stood alone finney calvin knox and to abraham lincoln that's right stood alone men who who do great things men of vision amen men of vision will stand alone men who walk by revelation will stand alone it doesn't matter what the deacon board says it doesn't matter what mama says or or what the so-called uh bishop says no we stand alone amen with god and these are men of vision see men of spiritual understanding stand alone and i think that uh that's because that jesus had to stand alone himself so we realize that it's not so much a group revelation amen when god reveals to you it's hard for you to re explain revelation to any other person because revelation is for you personally amen it goes beyond the intellectual mind and into your heart amen is something that you know that you know that you know is going to happen and when it comes to you by revelation that it becomes a fixed idea your heart is fixed is anchored amen so now we know then as we uh approach this subject through uh the story of joseph will understand how joseph had to stand alone he had nobody's uh help amen he had a vision he was given dreams early on amen and he would share those dreams with his brethren and even his father and his family and he suffered for it because they thought that he was out of his mind and he was uh trying to say that they're all going to bow to him and who after all who are you see but joseph was not puffed up he was just merely sharing his vision that god showed him all those dreams and we realized that two dreams brother brown said is in fact a vision so he shared that testimony and the bride of jesus christ have shared that testimony we receive revelation we receive these promises amen seven thunders give faith seven thunders is a bride's revival amen adoption time this is the dispensation of adoption no other age it wasn't in luther's days it wasn't in wesley's age it wasn't in any other age but this age because nature is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god we see all the the actual volcanoes and the the the hurricanes and the typhoons and the fires that are taking place around the world nature is upset something has taken place we all know what it all means it's the it's time for the manifestation of the sons of god because nature is groaning nature is testifying amen that this is the time for born sons phil sons amen place sons to finally stand up and take their position amen uh and and be the man of god that god wants us to be men who go under inspiration these are men of vision men of vision and spiritual understanding they all have had to stand alone because jesus did the same jesus did the same so now uh this is why we need more god called men more god called men and it is sad to see in this message today recently i spoke of uh to my church how there's a great such a great division among believers and it's so sad to hear and see especially when it comes to politics there are people that gotten so involved in politics that they are upset with each other they don't hardly speak to each other over which president was elected which president won who lost what do i care amen the bride should not care one bit if this world was of our world jesus said this world is not of my this kingdom this world is not of my uh world if it was so therefore my subjects my servants would fight for it we're not fighting for this world amen we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved so it doesn't matter who wins who loses whatever i have decided long ago to vote for jesus christ amen because he has never let me down everything that he promised you take a politician you take anyone elect official they'll promise you this they'll promise your that your your your your your your neighborhoods are going to be re uh rebuilt and this like that and whatever your benefits will be greater on your job and so forth they promise and promise and promise and tell me who has ever come forth for you but when jesus makes a promise this is why i voted for jesus long ago when he makes a promise even his promises are true they he cannot lie everything he said shall come to pass if it has not already this is why i don't get involved with politics it doesn't matter and so it's so disturbing to me how so many people i'm not sure why i'm saying these things i hope i'm not uh taking too much time i don't understand how many uh message people got so hooked up into this political uh thing thinking that a single man is going to make this world better or or or or or or be used to do x y and z i'm going to tell you something god will complete his work with one individual or the other individual or whatever it is amen he doesn't need our help amen because god's law and his plan of redemption is already fixed so no one man they thought because the president was uh somebody who mentioned prayer and mentioned this and the that the other that he was a christian and all the evangelicals there have gone here have gone crazy they have they have uh gone into a meltdown mode and me so many people also have made fun of the way they have behaved evangelicals see i the reason being is the religious world the reason they are in that condition is because they rejected the true message of the hour amen there cannot be no uh president that is going to establish any kind of kingdom in this world brother branham said if he had abraham lincoln or or in every state if he had a godly man in every state filled with the holy ghost it still would not be able to come back why because here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come i tell you get ready get ready get get get ready get ready get ready it's time to go home amen we are not of this world so therefore amen if you stop talking to your mama or your papa and got into political things that you should not have gotten into amen pray that the devil comes off of you because i tell you what that is the devil we have enough uh problems in this message to be divided over politics amen so this is why see god we need god called men to stay with the word of god now uh today i want to speak on such a man that strive to reach it his uh destiny and until that time until that time the word of the lord tried him amen brother branham says in the revelation of jesus christ now joseph when he was born he was hated by his brethren is that right now i want to show you joseph represents the spirit-filled church let me repeat that joseph represents the spirit-filled church joseph was hated of his brethren because he was spiritual joseph could not help because he could see visions amen that's a gift we were born with all the things that god uh all the gifts that god you're not you can't obtain a gift you're born with a gift amen so therefore see uh joseph could not help because he could see visions he could not help because he dreamed dreams he he could interpret dreams he that was in him see he could not display anything else but that but what that was in him see so joseph was just displaying what was in him he could not be anyone else amen and we realized in type this is why the father gave him a seven color coat he meant a rainbow coat because it was a type of that nature that was in joseph amen and remember joseph represents the spirit-filled church even he that was he that was what was in him see uh he could not display anything else but what that was in him well then his brothers hated him without a cause but his father loved him because his father was a prophet amen so uh let's go through this just a second joseph amen struggle to find his purpose in life and many of us wondering what is our purpose what is our position in christ jesus where do we fit in the body we all struggle with that and trying to figure out lord where do you want me uh to be the best i can be within the body well therefore i will say that is not our choice uh and that is uh we just need to yield amen ourselves to the holy spirit and pray and he will uh put us in a place that he feels we are most uh qualified see but until god created a need a crisis an emergency that desperately required uh your god his god-given gifts no one else uh can handle the crisis of the emergency in other words here's what i'm saying joseph had a gift but that gift could only be used at a certain time and we realize that uh there is a need and where there ever there's a need there's got to be an answer to that need to fulfill that need so therefore when joseph was struggling and trying to figure out well i just had these dreams i shared with my brothers and so forth amen so when he uh those visions that he had those dreams that he could not help him at that time you see because he was being uh it was being revealed to him and i don't think it was revealed to him in fullness amen that he was born a leader amen and he was just innocently sharing it with his brethren and his family and whoever would hear it amen he was born a leader amen and the church of the living god the spirit the the spirit spirit-filled church we're not slave we were born to be kings and priests we are born to be leaders hey amen we're not born to serve the world amen we're not born to serve the devil we're not sir born to serve his the evil works amen we are born to rule we are born to rule over this earth we are born to to have authority over evil spirits that is what we are born for amen anything shorter than that amen we are living under our privileges so we realize now let us continue amen i'm watching the clock i don't want to keep you long amen i trust that you love me after this amen god predestinate things see uh to uh predestinate things amen and things happen only to meet the challenge so now let me make this clear proving his word he says now i want you to notice he does it uh that way in every age he does it every time by the same method so you see god if you want to see what really god is going to do read in your bible and see how he's done it in the past and we we will see how he does it in the future because this is the same thing that he the same method brother brown said that he uses he has to take believers and then in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it uh predestinated to that age so every believer is predestinated to a specific age amen so they're predestinated to meet the challenges of the age in which they are placed amen do you see that see he's got to predestinate this thing uh to be there to meet the challenge of the age so therefore every age has a challenge every age has a trial every age has a testing uh uh an element of being tested so he knows that there is going to be a challenge in a certain age so he predestinates believers to be manifested in the age of that challenge and we know that the reason they are predestinated they're predestinated to overcome the challenge of their age amen this is why the book of revelation says he that overcometh he that overcometh he that overcometh i'm not talking about overcoming the things of luther and wesley and pentecost and way back in another age this is the most difficult age amen that we are living in now the devil himself amen has been turned loose i mean it's so bad amen we're not fighting against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and devils that we have not seen yet on the face of this earth why but now do we run away from these trials do we run away from the boogeyman no god has predestinated a people for every age amen just like joseph was manifested in his day what was his purpose it was to preserve life so his purpose was to preserve life then there had to be a risk of losing that life in his age in order for him to be able to preserve the life amen that the devil wanted to uh to do away with everybody so now i hope that you're following me just just a second in every age there is a challenge and yet god predestinates a people he meant to meet the challenge of that day did you get it did you feel it do you see it do you understand that's what happened today he predestinated this by his for knowledge listen all of this that happened to 2020 this is all ready predestinated listen we're trained for this already amen and we should be standing and saying satan is that all you've got amen you can't defeat me with covet you can't defeat me with the economic disasters amen paul said amen there is no nothing shall separate us from the love of god no famine no nakedness of sword nothing present nor things to come shall be able to separate us from the love of god that is the believer's testimony praise god hallelujah i'm talking about the bride believers now i'm not talking about make believers when he predestinated in malachi 4 see it's got to happen when he comes over and produce predestinates anything to happen in his word uh see he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time amen when he sees disaster he plans a certain disaster for every ager challenge for every day for that age he knows that that believer that seed will be there at that time what for to stand as a testimony that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever because in every age god has his witnesses amen witnesses of his resurrection that god is not dead but he's alive amen he is alive he knows that seed will be there just at that time he's uh he predestinated a bride so in this day a bride will be there amen in this age in this most difficult challenging age god has already predestinated a bride to be here why to be defeated to run back in denominations no that's not the reason he predestinated bride to be manifested so she's going to be there she's going to be in uh to be raptured she's going to be there he's predestinated by foreign knowledge see there's nothing going to stop it amen and that is the believers amen to the word of god amen nothing when you grab a hold of that word the promises that god has uh so beautifully revealed to us all the mysteries the hidden mysteries amen many people say the mysteries are not open amen listen in the book of revelations chapter 10 amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound what does it say the mystery of god should be finished and brother branham anointed that scripture amen for his for his own ministry the mysteries of god should be finished just because you don't see it it doesn't mean they're not finished amen you maybe be blind to it amen so therefore the malachi 4 was vindicated by the mysteries of the book amen when he opened the seventh seal when he opened amen and uh revealed to us the coming of the lord the seventh under the seven seals and so forth amen that we're preaching vindicated prophet amen because this angel of revelations 10 amen when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of god should be finished amen as was written in the bible so therefore we're not looking for another messenger to try to make this more clear it's clear in itself amen brother brown said the seventh seal is is like a rocket that goes up amen uh like firework and it explodes and one explosion creates two explosions and two turns into four four into eight and eight into sixteen and it goes on and on keeps exploding amen what what are those explosions they are mysteries being manifested amen and the seventh seal is still exploding it will explode until the coming of the lord this mystery being made real this mr b made real but it's all ready unveiled if you can believe it because if brother branham ever have to come back to reveal anything amen then we where do you place that in the word there's no type there's no shadow there's nothing for you to be able to teach that doctrine amen neither can you preach amen i am the holy ghost that is the most uh doctrine of error that i have ever heard i am the holy ghost we are filled with the holy ghost how can we be fi how can we be the holy ghost when jesus told his disciples to go into the upper room amen after they had received amen the holy spirit of promise that was a promise that they received when he breathed upon them they received the promise amen of it was sealed by the word but they still had to go to the upper room and be filled with the holy spirit and the holy spirit it may come down on the day of pentecost broke uh and divided himself amen among the 120 it was god uh the holy spirit in one man jesus christ in its fullness then it divided himself amen among the of the bride of jesus christ and whenever somebody tells you you are the holy spirit what it is i'm going to tell you is uh the devil trying to take that desire out of you to even seek the holy spirit amen we must be signing and crying for the baptism of the holy spirit it's not uh an intellectual something that you hear it's an experience that comes into your heart amen and you'll never be the same praise god you can't just teach the holy ghost that you have it already or you are that's a good baptist doctrine brother branham said it's not a bride doctrine it's a baptist doctrine and we're not amen the womb our spiritual bride womb has been sealed no other seed can enter there it's too late satan the word is in the bride amen there is no false seed amen that can enter into that bride won't praise god because she's already expecting the perfect amen manifestation of the word amen by the perfect word so you see men always will look to make things even more interesting with more appeal amen and that's how eve was deceived because she wanted a greater light she wanted something different she got bored with uh just what she had i tell you what i'm not bored amen it's a new experience every day amen i'm satisfied with this message of malachi 4. amen it keeps me going every day and in fact every time i read a book hear a tape i get more and more i can exhaust god amen it's a one baptism many feelings one baptism but many refillings and feelings and feelings amen but you can never ever misplace the holy ghost by telling people that they are the holy ghost that's an error folks and that will always be an error amen i know i knew that for years i didn't say anything but i knew that based on conversations i've had with certain individuals i knew that for years that's false amen and i knew when it started to ride in like that amen watch where it takes you you had this time uh also of of the movement going back to israel oh they're gonna take the message to israel and uh the turning from the gentiles uh dispensation over to the jews and we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that that all phases out you don't hear much about that anymore why brother branham uh see that god already has his moses and elijah ready amen to visit amen the jews with the mighty holy ghost revival he doesn't need our help not even brother branham could have gone there amen although he believed that they would have received the sign of of the prophet that that every uh jew always believed their prophets and of course the signs and brother branham had uh the holy ghost with signs following amen he did believe that they would receive it but it wasn't his ministry it wasn't his calling so just stay within your ministry stay let us just stay loving one another and trying to uh finally uh unite together the unity of the faith one lord one baptism one one faith praise god see we have a hard time just doing that but meanwhile we're gonna try to save israel too we can't even save ourselves amen so anyway okay i don't know why i said that but so now let's uh wind it down if i can i'm sorry i'm taking this long uh let's wind it down with joseph the next few minutes i'm going to speak about joseph because we spoke about how god always predestinates somebody to meet the challenge of their time see there's a word and there's a messenger there's an age and there is uh people amen to receive the messenger of that age so now we're speaking about our word our promise our time adoption time amen through this very beautiful type of joseph we just realized that joseph was loved by the father and yet hated of his brethren in genesis 37 we we i don't want to go and read the whole thing but the father loved uh joseph and expressed it in a way that he gave him a seven color coat beautiful coat and we know that was just a type amen because no one else could really use that coat but joseph because joseph was spiritual he was uh in tight uh manifesting jesus christ in type amen joseph was not jesus but he was a type of jesus nothing against joseph realize that but we realize that the father gave him the garment of a seven color rainbow coat testifying of the very virtues that was in joseph and he made him a coat and his brothers were jealous because they did not receive the same coat not only that but uh he was a spiritual uh young man joseph was a spiritual young man loved by his father hated by his brethren and this is why it's more important friends that we know that we are loved by our fathers a father rather than be loved by our brethren and this is why i have often come into the pulpit many times i said i would rather tell the church what the lord tell told me to say amen rather than and and if they are offended i rather they be offended with me then my father be offended with me because if i do what my father tells me to do then i'm uh doing the works of my father so we realized how joseph was so pleasing to uh jacob that uh amen he had this special relationship with his uh son joseph and he loved him because he was a child of his old age but now let's continue this story because joseph was a dreamer he dreamed he couldn't help but he was a dreamer amen and he had several dreams of course that were very similar and we know that the prophet said that two dreams similar dreams or two dreams of the exact same interpretation is actually a vision so what joseph was actually living in was a vision and yet it was out of season amen it showed that he was to rule he couldn't rule his brethren at that time they hated to he even hear what he had to say so we realized that after he innocently shared his uh dreams and testimonies with his brother his brothers got so angry amen that day uh one day when his their brother joseph was looking out for them and they saw and they conspired to number one remove and take and steal his coat and number two cast them into a ditch amen then the false doctrine was started that joseph was dead it started with the brethren and could you imagine they slayed an animal put the animal blood all over joseph's coat amen and they preach this falsehood to jacob and the rest of the family and they mourn the death of joseph and yet they stay silent because they were all privy to that lie and remember the spirit-filled church is not dead she's alive surely god has a crop somewhere she may not be visible but god is growing a crop somewhere god is training a people god is training a group of people around the world amen that's gonna come to perfection by the word amen even you see the popular people that i don't see nothing i don't see nothing happening and everything that the prophet said is not why should i stay in a message church when nothing has taken place but surely god has a church somewhere that's coming to perfection by the word of god amen so that so therefore when we see how they cast them into a ditch i'm going to hurry up now because my time is running out joseph was born a spiritual man a prophet a seer a dreamer an interpreter of dreams spiritual and he was hated by his brethren loved by the father a perfect type as i said of the church they hated him without a cause and many times you wonder why uh groups of people they get blasted they get uh evil things said against them you wonder why i'm just trying to do the will of the father and people have taken and and gone into public platforms and this is why i don't have a facebook account the church has one but i personally don't amen you know why because all the grievances and things like that are put on facebook and and we're blasting one another showing this video of you blasting someone and you calling somebody a black mamba you calling this one uh uh that one you think god is pleased with our behavior do you think god is pleased with that amen you may feel good about oh yeah i zinged them among that one but the holy spirit amen the tutor that is looking and follows you everywhere one thing you cannot tell the tutor okay uh you have to stay out of this uh i want you to follow me into this place no the tutor follows you everywhere and the tutor cannot be bought out because he reports back to the father exactly what you have done and what you uh will do amen our behavior our nature has come so short of that which we profess to have we're supposed to have by now amen faith virtue knowledge tempers patience at least a measure of it and and striving to be uh positionally placed but the first one to cross you you want their head you chop their head off and you blast and you put this one into hell and take them out of hell of the next week and and they're in purgatory i'm glad that you're not god hey man i'm glad that god is god because our god is a god of mercy if we were to if god was to judge us the way we judge one another we would be finished friends amen and it's going to show you in this type of joseph that uh we are going to continue to speak on here so joseph was sold to midianite merchants they put him in a hole they were going to kill him and yet uh the elder said no let's not kill him uh but before he could go and reach joseph joseph was already sold amen to the midnight merchants amen for 20 pieces of silver jesse again once again uh the perfect type of jesus christ i hope you're following me now but now here is what i want to say in it all in this rejection of joseph in this uh real fierce rejection of who joseph was and what he was trying to share with the brethren they hated him they hated him and yet they put him in a hole and sold him to the first merchants that came around the midi night merchants for 20 pieces of silver and the merchants took him where they were where were they traveling they wasn't traveling see they had to be merchants that were traveling to egypt because god knew amen where to take that gift because he knew that that gift would be the deliverance of egypt in the time at an appointed time you see so the midianite merchants thought that they were just transporting a slave in their caravan but they didn't realize that they were transporting the prince of egypt and the one that would help deliver one of the mightiest men that could exist in egypt at the time that is who the midianites were transporting to the proper place because joseph could his ministry could not grow in canaan his ministry could only be made manifest in egypt because he was a man of vision he was a man that was uh ready and fixing to to lead but he had to lead somebody he had to see there had to be a need for a specific leader at the time and of course this is why sometimes we hate the trials because god we want to go from being born again straight into the leadership position without trial without a test without anything no you have to be molded you have to be child trained you have to be tested and tried the word of the lord must try you until his word came the word amen tried uh joseph so when we realized that when joseph or reached egypt then he was uh sold to potiphar as a servant but one thing that was uh beautiful about this story is that joseph was anointed joseph was blessed of god joseph had a different spirit with him amen why because god amen he was he was spiritual he was blessed everything that he touched amen was blessed of god and when potiphar took him into his house amen his house immediately amen become blessed the anointing changes in in his entire house and he was blessed there was a joy in the house and things were uh looking up amen and of course then then come the trial potiphar's wife accused him now you see you talk about being tempted you're gonna have uh three wild attacks money women popularity and there joseph was facing that first attack amen woman amen who uh desired him potiphar's wife desired joseph but he overcame amen and this is what i tell my young people don't stand around waiting how long you can forebear amen run for your life that's what joseph did to overcome amen don't go into these shady places and stay and see i'll see i'm not tempted as much as i sh i could be no run the other way that was his victory that was joseph's victory don't stand around trying to figure out how long you can hang around in in the devil's uh uh territory run for your life and guess what it cost him his job it cost him his job even but he overcame the trial amen he did not fall for potiphar's wife amen and that trial cost him and put him in jail oh some of us don't want to trial some of us have to go through the period of time where we uh after we overcome we think well bless god god is gonna uh give me a blessing and we find ourselves sometimes in another trial in a deeper hole as it were but you see what god was doing he was testing joseph until his prophecy amen until the vision came amen to pass he had to try amen that gift and mold that gift that gift was not ready yet to rule he was it was not ready amen to uh take the position of authority so god chose to put him first in uh to allow to put him in prison uh we realized that part of her amen put him into prison take thinking that he had uh desired his wife and of course once again he was accused amen and they hated him without a cause so he ended up in prison and i have loved this type so many times before what did he do in prison in a time that if anyone could have had uh a complaint it was joseph he could have had a complaint he could have asked god lord what did i do to deserve this what did i do that my brethren sold me for 28 pieces of silver lord what did i do but just ran away from potiphar's wife i didn't want to sin amen what did i do and i end up in prison amen what he ended up was in god's training ground sometimes you have to go through the hard trials sometimes you have to go through those moments where where it seems like god is far away from you but god has ordered this trial remember amen so he went into prison and guess what the holy spirit was still upon him god prospered him god blessed him and so much that he took over the prison amen and this is why i always say satan if you're gonna put me in prison or if i'm permitted to go in prison i'm gonna take over that prison i am i want you to be reminded that i am amen i call the shots amen if i'm gonna dwell in this prison i call a shot so joseph had a nature had an ability had a character to rule and every place he was placed he ruled amen he took over the prison amen the the the the prison guards okay listen we leave everything unto you amen you run it the way you want to run it oh my my so god blessed him in the prison and one day he came across amen two of uh pharaoh's servants one was a baker and the other ones one was a butler a baker and a butler now i want you to see the beautiful story and i'm closing soon how now he's gotten a little closer to the throne amen he went at first he was introduced to potiphar okay he was uh pharaoh's uh captain of the guards okay but now he meets two individuals that are actually servants of pharaoh and he's coming a little closer now to the throne and we realize that with god's gift in joseph those two uh servants had dreams and of course the butler had a dream and the baker had a dream and they needed they were troubled in their spirit and joseph one day going around the jail he asked him why are you so sad today can you imagine joseph going around jail asking the president why are you so sad today oh joseph must have had a inner happiness that the others did not have why you so sad amen and that's one thing about a son of god god will give you something even in your trial that you will not be affected by the outside world listen if you are a christian a true born again christian god amen you're sealed in and the outside world is sealed out you're not affected by the outside world and and we see that in joseph he was in prison he wasn't affected by the outside world amen he even asked those two uh servants why are you so sad and they told them we had dreams and now here is the gift that god uh was training all along and he told them the interpretation of those uh two uh dreams that they had one [Music] was interpreted to life and the other one to death the baker he was to lose his life and the butler would be restored and we know the story i'm gonna wind down now because i don't want to keep you much longer we all know the story how the butler when he joseph told him that he would be restored amen and when you go back to pharaoh please remember me and speak kindly amen of me to pharaoh and uh that's what he did but the butler came back he forgot joseph for another two years the gift of god was still being honed in prison honed in prison and a rumor going around throughout the land of canaan that joseph had died and meanwhile joseph was in prison being tested proven until just fixing to come back into a view into public into power amen but listen to this why it wasn't the butler who forgot god took it out of his memory because at that time there was no famine in the land at that time there was no emergency pharaoh was not troubled and his testimony about joseph would would not be effective even if he told pharaoh listen there's a man in prison that his name is joseph and he can interpret dreams and so forth oh no no he was busy celebrating he was uh drunk and so forth he wasn't in the right frame of mind to receive that report two years pass now pharaoh had the dreams now it wasn't the dreams that saved pharaoh it was the interpretation of the dream that saved egypt see because pharaoh would have perished perish with his dreams but the gift is what brought the truth out of the dream so when pharaoh dreamed the dream and he called his ministers to discuss it and not a one of them could could tell them what it was it was a great mystery and then the butler remembered he remembered why there was a time of of emergency pharaoh was troubled all of egypt was troubled when pharaoh is troubled then all of egypt is troubled his uh aids in the in the palace are troubled with uh pharaoh but what happened as i finish this simple thought and yet so true he said i forgot to tell you i am so sorry that uh when i was put in jail because i displease you pharaoh i was put in jail and i met somebody in jail oh who interpreted my dream now it was an emergency now there was a need now there was a situation that needed to be addressed amen and god had trained the gift for the need amen for that hour so you see when the squeeze comes down when there is a need amen so urgent that it has to uh manifest the truth of god in a manifestation of the sons of god don't worry amen brother brown said the third pull it won't be used in a very big way until the time comes amen when the squeeze comes down watch the third pull then watch the manifestation of the sons of god born sons fill sons place sons come into position they have been trained for these years and years and years for such a time as this amen you say it's getting worse well the sons of god are getting more powerful the daughters of god is getting more powerful they are trained for this position they're trained for this uh uh job amen so when joseph was called amen by pharaoh oh my he waited for that call for many years and he stood in the front of pharaoh and pharaoh told him his dream he said they tell me that you have a gift to interpret dreams amen he said no not i'm not i can not me that can interpret dreams but the god that's in me amen can interpret uh the dream so therefore tell me your dream and god used that gift amen at the right time to fill a need that was needed amen he told him of a 14-year prophecy seven years of plenty seven years of famine was coming and not only that he joseph himself told pharaoh and wrote out a resume this is a man that you need to do this job he should uh be spirit-led he should know what he's doing he should do this he should be able to qualify to do this he should be he should qualify to do that the other he wrote the resume and no one else could have filled that job but joseph himself why because there was a need at that time amen until his word came the word of the lord tried joseph so now it finally had come joseph had arrived to his destiny he was born to rule amen he ruled in the prison he ruled in potiphar's house but now god was lifting him up higher a little bit much higher than before even because now we were talking about the right hand man of pharaoh oh my and nobody could have fit that uh slot but joseph himself amen when god is training his people god is training his men for the last great kill nobody can take your place because you have been trained for this purpose you have been trained for such a time as this amen let the devils turn loose but god has a people god has a church god has a a a group of people that will be able to withstand every attack every a while attack of the devil amen and we're coming to that friends so therefore when pharaoh said oh what other men can we find to take this job but the man who's standing in front of me you told me about this you told me what he needs to be there is no one that qualifies for this job but you and i'm gonna tell you something my friends amen it's time for the manifestation of the sons of god and god has been training his people in the backside of the desert amen we have been forgotten among many other uh people we are considered no longer in the message amen there's rumors going around oh oh they died long ago they're oh they're finished whatever oh no god is is training and honing those sons of god in the backside of the desert just waiting for the opportunity amen to manifest that gift that god has placed in the bride of jesus christ and that bride that gift is not just for just healing i'm talking about god himself tabernacle in these vessels walking the literal manifestation of the sons of god that when they see you they see the father jesus christ wants to get in your human skins amen speak the word what do you want you need rain for your crops speak and it shall be done what is it amen that your your family is backslidden your son your daughter is is his wayward and needs god just speak the word amen and brother branham as an example seed's son he demonstrated the spoken word with five manifestations we see creation we see salvation we see uh all kinds of sun power over the elements sun stands still come out and shine uh four days so he commanded the weather to move forward see that's the manifestation of the sons of god in full display but it will not be in full use until there is amen a real need for it so friends you may have gone through a period of your time in prison you've suffered you've paid your dues but don't worry every step every day is getting you closer to the throne you're coming out of prison the church is coming out of prison amen and it'll be a mighty manifestation of the sons of god amen and i'm going to tell you something to show you amen i am i'm gonna just go down to the end i'm done i'm finished i can't keep you any longer but to show you how god had to mold and shape joseph and put him through trials in such a way that it molded and and mellowed him out his brothers lied about him his brothers sold him for 20 pieces of silver and in fact preach false doctrines to his own father who suffered for years and mourned his loss can you imagine for years and yet he was alive he had a right to be upset with his brothers he had a right to be uh vengeful and say you know they don't deserve to live but when they saw when joseph saw his own brothers on the line to get food when the famine was heating up throughout the land of canaan and they was coming from all parts of the world to uh be fed because israel rather egypt had the corn had everything had this uh store houses uh full of food and joseph was in charge the dream was no longer a dream the dream was a reality amen joseph had reached his destiny he was born for that purpose amen so you see if there was a famine and there needed to be a deliverance okay the famine is going to come but also a deliverance is going to come as well amen the world is longing to see jesus it's getting late they will see jesus and the only jesus they they will see is that jesus in you when he saw his brethren and he didn't want them to know who he was and he spoke in the egyptian language and of course they could not believe that he was joseph he looked different he talked different he talked a different language but joseph knew and in his heart what did he have to do at the end he didn't have to do it but he still had love for his brothers who sold him he still had love for his brothers and he was a spiritual man knowing that he would have never gotten to egypt unless they put him on that caravan of the midianites so god ordered the entire program and joseph being spiritual he understood that he said you had to do what you had to do amen but i realized i forgive you how's my daddy is he still is still alive how's my brother is he still alive oh what a wonderful time of restoration and fellowship it must have been and friends no matter how or what we have gone through people may have talked bad about you they may have cast your name aside dirtied up your name they could do that but they can never dirty you up in front of god because god knows your heart god knows what you're striving to do amen let men say what they want to say let people say what they want to say you keep your eyes on jesus and ask him always on a daily basis lord keep me in this uh trial keep me in this trial because the word of the lord will try you until your word comes amen what is your word a word of what you're predestinated to be that's what your word is i mean god said in the beginning that you are going to be x y and z that's what you are going to be so therefore that's your destiny and believe me amen god said we are now are we the sons of god doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him and there's many prophecies amen the church of the living god will stand like a mighty marching army there is going to be a church amen and she's going in the rapture as a testimony amen that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we all have been manifested in this age amen but there's no challenge there is no trouble there is nothing no principality no power that can separate us from the love of god amen because we are predestinated overcomers in this day amen in this day and age and i'm going to close with this one quote because it's so beautiful amen god bless you thank you for being patient and listening to to me and i know i'm not behind the pulpit and running around and uh but this is the way uh we minister to our church amen heartfelt encouragement to the church and i trust it to be a blessing to you but now this is uh what i want to close and i'm sorry i kept you this long hear ye him you know what happened then when that boy becomes a certain age that boy was adopted into the family now what did they do they took him out in a public place amen put a special robe on him and had a ceremony and all the people of the city gathered around and looked and then they looked upon this boy and the father had a ceremony of adoption amen oh don't miss this now see after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddy's amen what a time what a season we're living in his name on the checkbook was as good as his daddy's name when you see me you see my father amen there where god's trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved and it'll uh and it will move authority sons of god the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god waiting to a spot where that the sickness will be arise and it will be that way see the blind will receive their sight the deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll commend it don't say uh didn't say that these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he said they shall cast out devils not i will cast out devils but they will cast out devils see and that's you and i amen if you say to this man if you say not i say if you say to this mountain if you save this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption sons and daughters uh needs adoption and i conclude this uh message with saying amen uh brother branham sons and daughters we need adoption and like joseph had to be tested for years for years for years his character needed to be honed here home there and at the end he had to express love to his brothers amen that's the real christian not somebody who just speaks good words and will cut your head off after the message no love by their fruits you shall know them because if what we are believing does not produce amen the fruit of the spirit then we are believing something that is incorrect amen what we believe should manifest and bring forth the fruits of the spirit and when joseph was standing there in his glory and his power the right hand of pharaoh and yet he still have forgiveness in his heart for his brothers i forgive you and he brought them all amen out of that land of canaan back into egypt and there they dwelled for years amen under his security and the the bountiful uh abundance of egypt they were all able to partake of it of course we know that after that uh they were put into bondage for 400 years or so after that because they came a pharaoh who knew not joseph and that is a whole chapter amen that oh to get into at some other time god bless you i enjoyed this uh sharing this little thought with you i trust that god would be with each and every one of you and understand uh i'm sorry for the choppiness of the message i was just trying to type out how joseph had to struggle and struggle and be tested and every test was designed to bring them one step to the right hand of pharaoh there's no mistakes there's no mistakes amen joseph spent every day that was predestinated for him to stay in the prison he spent every there's no mistakes in god amen so god richly bless you we trust that god's grace will be upon you all and we will be able to see one another soon not so much a virtual uh convention we love to see you face to face in a real live convention greetings from new york may god
