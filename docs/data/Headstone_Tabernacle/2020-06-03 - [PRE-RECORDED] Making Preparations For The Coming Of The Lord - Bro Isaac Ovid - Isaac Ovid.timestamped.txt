[19:33] Matthew 25 and reading from verse 1
[19:37] thank you the Gideon Matthew 25 and
[19:44] verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[19:49] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[19:52] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[19:54] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[19:56] and five were foolish they that were
[20:00] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[20:01] with them but the wise took oil in their
[20:05] vessels with their lamps while the
[20:08] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[20:09] and slept and at midnight there was a
[20:12] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[20:14] ye out to meet him then all those
[20:17] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
[20:19] and the foolish said to the wise give us
[20:21] of your oil for our lamps are going out
[20:24] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[20:27] there be not enough for us and you but
[20:29] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[20:32] for yourselves and while they went to
[20:35] buy the bridegroom came and they that
[20:38] were ready went in with him to the
[20:41] marriage and the door was shut
[20:42] afterward came also the other virgins
[20:44] saying Lord Lord open to us but he
[20:47] answered and said verily I say unto you
[20:49] I know you not watch therefore for ye
[20:53] know neither the day nor the hour
[20:55] wherein the Son of man cometh
[20:58] middle-order the blessing to the reading
[20:59] of his word he may be seated tonight in
[21:02] the presence of the Lord is such a great
[21:04] privilege to be back in the house of the
[21:06] Lord tonight and I really was blessed on
[21:08] Sunday how many were blessed on Sunday
[21:10] the double service the pillar of fire by
[21:13] the Anthony in the morning and brother
[21:16] over it in the evening your thoughts
[21:17] your testimony your life really really
[21:21] really a tremendous tremendous time and
[21:24] we looking for God to continue to do
[21:27] something for us in a special way
[21:28] tonight and I have a little thought
[21:30] tonight making preparation
[21:32] for the coming of the Lord making
[21:36] preparations for the coming of the Lord
[21:39] and in the message looking for Jesus but
[21:42] Abraham said now we want to speak us
[21:44] every meeting so this is my desire
[21:46] tonight about Jesus Christ he's a center
[21:48] for worship the center of our attraction
[21:52] the center of all of our life all that
[21:56] we have and want are and will be is
[21:58] based upon him he was the one who came
[22:01] and gave his life for us came down from
[22:03] God out of glory and was made flesh
[22:05] dwelt among us and taken upon him the
[22:08] sin of us all the sickness of us all boy
[22:11] awaits at Calvary and they appeared the
[22:13] price he's worthy of all the praise that
[22:15] can be given him do you feel that way
[22:17] this evening that he is worthy of all
[22:20] the praise that can be given to him and
[22:22] in God had a provided way I mean it's
[22:24] gonna touch in a few quotes God likes to
[22:27] show his power not that he has to but he
[22:30] loves to do it that's really powerful so
[22:32] he loves to do it it pleases him in his
[22:34] omnipotence to let his subjects know who
[22:37] he is and and he lets his subjects know
[22:39] who he is by his power but Aaron said
[22:41] I'm so happy of it because he showed me
[22:43] his power so we talking tonight about
[22:46] preparations and Myra bannerman said
[22:48] before God before you want more of God
[22:50] there's got to be more of God to respond
[22:53] to that crave so before God could have a
[22:55] desire in your heart that needs to be
[22:57] filled the the thing that is supposed to
[23:00] fill that is I have to exist before the
[23:02] desire could be there so there have to
[23:04] be some preparations mean before there
[23:07] could be a desire to have what has been
[23:09] repaired can the church say mmm so we
[23:11] building to something whether Branham
[23:13] said the people in the spirit of the
[23:14] latter days the nations are in the
[23:16] spirit of the end time they got atomic
[23:19] weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of
[23:21] things because it's the spirit of the
[23:23] deal the people are in the spirit of the
[23:26] end time the church is moving together
[23:28] under the power and the impact of the
[23:30] Holy Spirit the world is running out
[23:32] yonder and making fun scuffing laughing
[23:35] and they living like the devil every day
[23:36] it's in the spirit of the thing God's
[23:39] getting ready to take his and the devil
[23:42] is getting ready to take his so it's a
[23:44] preparation
[23:45] thing that's going on God is getting
[23:47] ready the devil is getting ready the
[23:49] world is getting ready the church is
[23:51] getting ready the bride is getting ready
[23:53] there's preparation that's happening all
[23:55] the time you may not think something's
[23:58] going on but you are getting ready the
[23:59] student who is going to school when you
[24:02] are not studying you are getting ready
[24:03] you're getting ready to fail because if
[24:05] you're not studying you're actually
[24:07] preparing yourself for failure but the
[24:09] person who is studying you're preparing
[24:11] yourself to overcome you preparing
[24:13] yourself to pass the exam because you're
[24:15] putting things in place because you're
[24:17] getting ready so even when you think
[24:19] you're doing nothing you're actually
[24:21] still making preparation because pepper
[24:23] ition is always going on can the church
[24:25] mmm not better Branum sin before God
[24:28] does anything he always prepares for it
[24:31] so God is not now deciding to do
[24:34] something he already prepared for it
[24:36] before he could do anything there has
[24:38] been a preparation made can the church
[24:41] amen whatever I said before we go over
[24:44] to fight a wall first we have to prepare
[24:46] for the war you don't go to a war
[24:48] without having some type of preparation
[24:49] some type of plan what am I gonna do if
[24:52] you want to travel somewhere you got to
[24:54] make preparation you can't travel
[24:55] without a passport you can travel
[24:57] without a ticket so you need to think
[24:59] about the passport before you could
[25:01] travel you have to think about it ticket
[25:02] before you could travel if you need
[25:04] clothes for the environment that you're
[25:06] going to you have to have clothes packed
[25:08] in your bag to meet the conditions that
[25:10] you're about to meet and where they ban
[25:12] them said to get over there you have to
[25:13] have divine love packed in your bag
[25:15] before you can get over there so you got
[25:17] to make preparations here so that you
[25:19] can meet the condition that exists over
[25:21] there can the church same and so far
[25:23] tighter tonight making preparations for
[25:26] the coming of the Lord before you go to
[25:28] fight you gotta make preparation before
[25:30] you can run a marathon you can't just
[25:32] wake up if you wake up in the morning
[25:34] and you have not been working out
[25:35] there's no marathon that you could run
[25:37] before you go 10 15 20 minutes you don't
[25:40] burn out if you want to run a marathon
[25:41] if you want to run a sprint a
[25:43] long-distance runner those people
[25:45] practice if it's every game every other
[25:48] day they watch what they eat their watch
[25:50] how they arrest they do their push-ups
[25:52] they do their setups they do everything
[25:54] because they know what they are
[25:55] preparing to do
[25:56] and if we are preparing for a rapture if
[25:59] we are prepared for a resurrection if
[26:00] you are preparing for wedding supper if
[26:02] you're preparing for healing if you're
[26:04] preparing for deliverance there's got to
[26:06] be some preparation that we are making
[26:09] before we leave this place come the

[26:17] me to be here this evening I had to make
[26:19] preparations because I didn't get to go

[26:40] when you meet the conditions you got to
[26:42] know it before you meet the conditions
[26:44] you got to know it David didn't even
[26:46] realize what he was preparing for
[26:48] somebody preached back to me David
[26:50] didn't even realize that when he met a
[26:52] lion

[29:47] there's got to be a power put into the
[29:49] church to pull your family to pull your
[29:51] loved ones because we're the panem said
[29:53] all that you love all I never loved you
[29:56] we'll be there jesus said the promise is
[29:58] unto you and to your children so you are
[30:01] getting prepared to prepare them by fire
[30:04] by power by time knowledge so we can
[30:07] leave this place can the church say man
[30:11] Oh glory you may be seated
[30:15] the cheering of Israel went out the turn
[30:18] of isn't one yeah the children of Israel
[30:21] living in bondage
[30:22] didn't know their head from their foot
[30:24] didn't know how they were gonna make it
[30:26] out they had been in bondage for so long
[30:29] didn't even thought it was a distant
[30:31] memory that I deliver I was gonna come
[30:34] but when Court is ready to have a
[30:36] deliverance he puts a man in there who
[30:38] can handle it and God flipped it so
[30:41] smooth he slipped Moses to be fed
[30:43] clothed and trained in Egypt so that he
[30:46] had the best food he had the best
[30:48] clothes he had the best education and
[30:50] when Cora's more prepared for him he
[30:52] said no come and go to the desert and
[30:54] and taught a little bit what is going to
[30:57] hit already he's making sure the
[30:59] conditions are right he's making sure
[31:01] everything is in place God loves he's a
[31:04] chess player he loves to put this piece
[31:06] here and put this piece here he's here
[31:08] not yet not yet not yet but when he's
[31:10] ready here comes Moses coming down into
[31:13] Egypt what Kingdom do you represent the
[31:16] kingdom of the Most High what God do you
[31:18] represent I don't know if you know his
[31:20] name but he said I am that I am strip me
[31:23] come on somebody preach back to me you
[31:27] know what I love the children of Israel
[31:29] really have feet but Moses his feed for
[31:32] them was bigger than the total of even
[31:34] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[31:37] the faith in the experience that Moses
[31:40] had was bigger than the tote the
[31:42] collective tote could not destroy Moses
[31:45] feet and the chest a man
[31:48] because when hero increase the world
[31:50] that was under people they had to have
[31:52] faith in something and they had to trust
[31:54] that Moses knew what he was talking
[31:56] about because it's Saturday mama they
[31:58] see you talking deliverance and the
[31:59] child's got heavier you're talking
[32:01] breakthrough and the pressure increase
[32:03] and Moses had to scream as other people
[32:05] hang in there
[32:07] just keep watching God is getting ready
[32:09] he's getting ready to break Pharaoh he's
[32:11] getting ready to set you free
[32:12] he's getting ready to restore your
[32:14] children what your grandfather went
[32:16] through that your children don't have to
[32:17] go through because the deliverer asked
[32:20] I had to wait all these years I was
[32:22] waiting for you to get here I was
[32:24] waiting for your children to get here
[32:25] because somebody have to go over to the
[32:28] promised land so Maurice Haman you may
[32:34] be seated
[32:35] hallelujah dear collective doubt let me
[32:39] say it again the collective doubt of the
[32:41] people was not enough to the minister
[32:44] faith Moses sarah's feeling about her
[32:47] woman our condition was not big enough
[32:49] the doubt she had could not open the
[32:51] feet that Abraham had come on now
[32:54] somebody speak to me
[32:55] so tonight I'm not talking about the
[32:57] feet of your family tonight I'm not
[32:59] talking about the feet of your children
[33:01] I'm talking about your feet being
[33:03] prepared to come to perfect fate because
[33:06] public sin is based on the position that
[33:09] you're standing in and all these the
[33:11] escort has been preparing you for your
[33:13] position as a son and daughter in the
[33:16] economy of God somebody say men tonight
[33:18] Oh hallelujah can the church say man
[33:25] David didn't know you may be seated
[33:27] that when he came to play bhop timber Oh
[33:31] will preach it then he was being
[33:33] prepared for the throne but you don't
[33:35] just get to the throne you got to
[33:37] understand how the throne room operates
[33:39] you got to understand who has the
[33:41] influence over where the ice bucket is
[33:43] you have to know which fan man is the
[33:45] man who controls the fans you have to
[33:47] understand which security guard but keep
[33:49] certain people out so when David is here
[33:51] playing the harp he is watching what's
[33:53] moving he knows who he gotta talk to he
[33:56] knows who has what influence what is God
[33:58] to and preparing David because one day
[34:01] this little boy is gonna be a king he
[34:03] didn't even understand what he was
[34:04] walking into but Korra's making
[34:06] preparations and God has been preparing
[34:09] you in your job in your school all these
[34:11] years every action every reaction is
[34:14] course preparation can the church say
[34:16] man but Abraham said God hidden sundry
[34:22] times he wanted his children to have the
[34:24] best do you believe that God wants you
[34:28] to have the best yes here's something
[34:31] nice in him he has here something
[34:33] good enough he ain't wanna have now said
[34:35] he said what he want to have the best so
[34:39] if you don't be best yet it means just
[34:41] tell every so what God's plan is for
[34:43] your life because he wanted him to have
[34:46] the best
[34:46] so he made preparations so his
[34:49] preparation is for you to have what the
[34:51] best come to church same and so he for
[34:54] shouted at rural prophets he had
[34:56] revealed it in Christ and the table is
[34:59] set today and every man and woman that
[35:01] invited us all welcome to come to this
[35:04] table for he was wounded for our
[35:06] transgressions and with His stripes we
[35:08] were healed it's all foreseen it's
[35:11] provided and prepared the meal is ready
[35:15] the call is given he foresaw it he made
[35:18] preparations it's God's provided way for
[35:21] you when your soul is hungry can the
[35:24] church say men and brethren said call
[35:27] always prepares the people for the
[35:30] events that's just about to happen so
[35:32] everything that's happening right now
[35:34] God has prepared his people for what's
[35:37] about to happen and I know in recent
[35:39] times at all these coronavirus
[35:41] understand that you have a lot of people
[35:42] people living in fear
[35:45] people making all kind of memes and
[35:47] jokes and comments and thing and it's a
[35:49] real thing it's a real people living in
[35:51] fear I mean one thing that Jesus said a
[35:57] lot was for fear not fear not till about
[36:00] 63 times you see fear not fear not
[36:03] whenever it is fear not you see for God
[36:04] hath not given us a spirit of fear so it
[36:09] is not in the book Valarie of christians
[36:11] they say I'm afraid of what I mean fact
[36:14] where the branch said be reckless and
[36:15] fearless anybody will me tonight I'm
[36:22] very balanced said and some of God's
[36:24] preparation has been so ridiculous to
[36:26] the people who depend on a tree of
[36:28] knowledge because God's preparation has
[36:31] been absolutely ridiculous to the
[36:33] natural mind because a natural mind can
[36:36] conceive the things that are of God
[36:38] because they are foolishness to him and
[36:40] he just think they thing is horrible to
[36:43] say why would God do something can the
[36:45] church same and
[36:46] so the whole world is preparing for
[36:47] funeral service but there are some
[36:49] people who are preparing for the
[36:51] resurrection they are preparing for the
[36:53] rapture they are preparing for the
[36:54] wedding supper listen if you want to
[36:56] take part in the Olympics I saw some
[36:59] training years ago for one of these
[37:01] swimmers in Olympia Greece and listen it
[37:04] was not just swimming you know it's
[37:06] every kind of hard exercise and he said
[37:09] for three years you have a routine
[37:10] because you want to win and he last knew
[37:12] he was this far from it a little bit and
[37:14] the amount of work what is it it's
[37:16] preparation that needs to be made can
[37:19] the church same and so there are people
[37:22] who are preparing because Jesus is
[37:24] coming for bride and by faith and
[37:26] declaring tonight the final call is on
[37:29] behold the bridegroom cometh I'm on the
[37:32] expectation because we have a purpose we
[37:34] have a destination but before we leave
[37:37] here God has got to give us something
[37:38] kind of church seem and now God but
[37:42] everyone said cannot make a decision
[37:43] today and tomorrow come back and make a
[37:45] better decision because his first
[37:47] decision is perfect he never has to
[37:50] change it so we can rest upon whatever
[37:52] God says can the church say Amen is not
[37:56] something we can rest upon whatever he
[37:59] says because he cannot come and make a
[38:00] better decision so when God called you
[38:03] there's no better plan he could put in
[38:04] place he already call you that's the
[38:06] best plan in place
[38:07] he picked the best out of everybody to
[38:10] give them this great gospel this great
[38:12] message and they're true many churches
[38:14] many groups many countries but they're
[38:16] all called
[38:17] on the one Lord on the one feet under
[38:20] one baptism can the church say man and
[38:23] it's always been God's Way to let his
[38:26] people know what's going to happen
[38:28] before it happens he doesn't let
[38:30] everybody know he doesn't let the dodo
[38:33] the wool let's have no but he lets his
[38:35] children or predestinated people or call
[38:38] out people so we are not surprised can
[38:40] the church say man by what's happening
[38:42] in the political realm you're not
[38:44] surprised by what's happening in the
[38:46] economic realm we're not surprised by
[38:48] what happening with wars and plagues and
[38:50] rumors of wars before the rain could
[38:52] fall in the days of nor God had to let
[38:54] nor knows what happened
[38:56] good Neiman judge Sodom and Gomorrha
[38:58] without elected Abraham know what is
[39:00] gonna happen is it how can I hide from
[39:04] Abraham what I'm about to do
[39:06] hallelujah and the relationship God had
[39:09] with Abraham was different than the one
[39:11] he has with you because you are bright
[39:13] you are wife he will have to let you
[39:16] know what he's about to do before he
[39:19] does anything he's gonna make sure that
[39:21] you are in the place you're supposed to
[39:23] be in before anything could happen to
[39:25] you and the church say man his love for
[39:28] you
[39:28] that's how love is love wants to reach
[39:30] out to you to let you know what's gonna
[39:32] happen
[39:33] can the church say Amen so no I was not
[39:36] surprised by when the rain began to fall
[39:39] no one knew how the story would end
[39:41] because God showed him the end because
[39:44] God is the beginning and the end he
[39:46] could show the end of the story before
[39:48] the children of Israel were in bondage
[39:50] court already told the end before the
[39:52] ponded she said with a mighty hand I'll
[39:54] bring them out
[39:55] he spoke of deliverance before they even
[39:58] went is a bondage come on now somebody
[40:00] preached back to me oh come on now so
[40:05] you don't think God knows all the
[40:06] struggles and the trials you went
[40:08] through and already nobody and looking
[40:10] like and he already kicked that end and
[40:12] true foreknowledge wrote your name in
[40:15] the book
[40:15] that's no devil could erase it no
[40:18] situation could move it no child could
[40:20] destroy it in fact he said what shall
[40:23] separate us from the love an cup pass
[40:26] Masum pestilence
[40:27] fear nothing so tonight we know how the
[40:32] story's gonna end
[40:33] oh we know our end and we know the
[40:36] devil's end I know my end because I
[40:39] don't have an ending come on somebody
[40:41] preach back to me oh the table things
[40:44] you know so you're gonna end but I have
[40:45] no end because I always was in corner Oh
[40:48] everything that had a beginning has an
[40:50] end name we never had a beginning
[40:52] because we were always a part of God but
[40:55] the devil had a beginning and he
[40:57] have an ending can the church say man
[41:00] this is what you've been preparing for
[41:01] Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of
[41:09] the Lord

[41:12] up you're looking on the ups and down
[41:14] but God already knows how your story is
[41:17] gonna end
[41:17] Oh at the end of your story I see the
[41:20] rapture at the end of your story I see
[41:22] your family at the end of the story I

[44:38] for you but it was angels of state
[44:41] formation because they have to go where

[44:53] from the west from the north from the
[44:56] south licks a fire he already seen the
[44:59] liquor fire
[45:00] hanging over your head one body made up
[45:06] of different members and we are not
[45:08] leaving this place until every man take
[45:11] his place
[45:12] Oh hallelujah
[45:13] you don't hear me tonight can the church
[45:18] say Amen we're not leaving here until
[45:20] every man is in its place
[45:22] when this body is ready to move when
[45:24] every man is in position but a balance
[45:27] at one time the last steam could be in
[45:28] Africa somewhere but one dear the last
[45:30] name will be called and that last name
[45:32] will take its place and that last name
[45:34] will meet the pillar of fire and the
[45:36] pillar of fire will move from God above
[45:38] us record with us to court in us and
[45:41] then when that last one is in its place
[45:43] when we have all come into the unity of
[45:45] the faith into the knowledge of the Son
[45:47] of God into the measure of the stature
[45:50] of the fullness of Christ till there's
[45:52] no more you and me but we are one
[45:54] calling us eyes glory to God you may be
[46:00] seated
[46:01] where he is ahead of the body wherever
[46:04] he moves the body moves where he looks
[46:07] the body looks no more man in the middle
[46:09] of the relationship that's why I said of
[46:11] - ministry is unlimited people don't
[46:14] like to hear that boy is a limited
[46:15] ministry because God always wanted a
[46:18] personal connection with you personal
[46:21] connection with me he want no Secretary
[46:24] between you and him you don't want
[46:25] nobody up to represent to me for him it
[46:28] was Christ was the only water to even
[46:30] relate to you before him can the church
[46:32] say men making preparations for the
[46:38] resurrection for the rapture for the

[50:53] thinking and you begin to reverse the

[51:10] gonna change you walk being in a change
[51:12] your talk begin a change
[51:14] Oh somebody say man I heard recently
[51:18] they did an experiment with some things
[51:22] some people who like over like 70 80
[51:24] years old and the sat with him and he
[51:27] started to talk with him and decided to
[51:29] take them back memory lean to when they
[51:30] were younger back tuck me in and in the
[51:33] situation and existed when they were
[51:34] like in their 20s and they found
[51:36] something very interesting before they
[51:38] did the experiment they put some visual
[51:40] things for him to read and stuff and
[51:41] when they started the same note he ain't
[51:44] always 19 whatever take them back after
[51:46] why the city people like I said I see
[51:48] better because the brains had to tell
[51:50] them
[51:51] ready back in nineteen twenty and they
[51:53] started to believe that they were no
[51:55] longer in 2011 so and the experiments
[51:59] showing how powerful the mind is about
[52:01] your state of behavior so that if you
[52:03] think you're younger it's very true when
[52:05] you have a think you're feeling young I
[52:07] said to move a certain way your body
[52:08] actually respond so you're thinking so
[52:11] when you say I'm defeated your body
[52:13] actually is response to that call' of
[52:15] you being defeated when you say I am
[52:18] tired you know you're actually
[52:19] reinforcing that that's you signing it
[52:21] you are proving it
[52:22] you-you'd that's and let the weak say
[52:26] and when you begin to speak a certain
[52:29] way all of a sudden so what he's going
[52:31] to say I'm getting ready I'm getting
[52:32] ready to leave this place
[52:33] I'm getting ready for my healing I'm
[52:35] getting ready for my deliverance I'm
[52:36] getting ready to welcome my son who's
[52:38] back sitting home all of a sudden things
[52:41] begin to move in please
[52:42] because you are walking in this thing
[52:44] you are prophesying in this thing you
[52:46] are living in an atmosphere you are
[52:48] actually making preparations with your
[52:50] worship you're making preparations with
[52:52] your declarations oh come on now

[53:15] you could hold them because you don't
[53:16] even have no power so anybody who come
[53:19] aggressive at the table that's why
[53:20] butter brown suggests a boo back boo
[53:23] I'll be poised nah no complicated phrase
[53:25] a biblical taboo so you see when you say
[53:28] boo back to eat everything say okay okay
[53:30] because the devil has no power the devil
[53:33] lost his power whatever power he had

[54:23] realize that there was nothing stopping
[54:24] her there was nothing holding her back
[54:27] from climbing what was rightfully hers

[57:43] what we expect him can the church say
[57:46] man and we are an expectation for
[57:49] seventh on the revival we are an
[57:51] expectation with the coming of the Lord
[57:53] Simeon was an expectation to see the
[57:55] Christ the Bible said Simeon was just
[57:58] under vote and the only way you can get
[58:00] the Holy Ghost is to be just under vote
[58:02] just like the 3,000 souls who were just
[58:05] under vote on the Holy Ghost fell upon
[58:07] him Cornelius was just a new vote and
[58:09] prayed all the time a memorial went up
[58:11] to heaven for his prayers are you
[58:14] building a memorial for your prayers
[58:16] that you could be recognized as a prayer
[58:19] warrior are you looking for something
[58:21] fault are you running around in another
[58:24] world are you not sure where you're
[58:25] standing you don't know where you're at
[58:27] what are you looking for
[58:28] but simian was just and devout waiting
[58:30] for the consolation of Israel and we are
[58:33] waiting for the consolation of the bride
[58:35] a power of God what dynamics to the
[58:38] mechanics and the Holy Ghost was upon
[58:40] Simeon and the Holy Ghost is upon you
[58:42] tonight hallelujah it was revealed to
[58:44] him by the Holy Ghost that he could not
[58:46] see that and it is revealed to us by the
[58:48] Holy Ghost ruh the word that we shall
[58:50] not seek that we shall not all sleep it
[58:52] was revealed to us that we are going to
[58:54] be made perfect it was revealed to us
[58:56] that we are going to be adopted is
[58:58] revealed to us that it's gonna be a
[58:59] power come into your life not just in
[59:01] the church but into your life into your
[59:04] home into your bedroom on your job there
[59:08] be a power that you are gonna have not
[59:10] just the church but you are gonna have
[59:12] your individual inheritance you will
[59:14] have power you will have authority if
[59:17] you shall see this is not the preacher
[59:19] but maybe you if you shall say come the
[59:22] church say Amen Simeon was old Simeon
[59:26] was tired
[59:27] Simeon's friends maybe they stopped
[59:29] coming to church but not Simeon because
[59:31] he was under expectation to see the
[59:34] Lord's Christ could you imagine the
[59:35] critics simians critics the Sadducees of
[59:38] Pharisees though whoever it was in
[59:40] church a long time since Simeon who do
[59:42] you think you are you that you wanna see
[59:44] the Christ you take all these years you
[59:46] think you are not important
[59:47] Simeon you're not a high priest Eliot a
[59:50] deacon you know to you what do you think
[59:52] it is and the church say man
[59:53] but nothing could stop Simeon from
[59:56] getting up every day and being way
[59:58] supposed to be peradventure today is the
[1:00:01] day so he was making preparations
[1:00:03] because he didn't know what day would
[1:00:05] come that the Lord's Christ will come
[1:00:07] walking into the temple and we don't
[1:00:09] know what they will come that will be
[1:00:11] your tear for the Holy Ghost your tear
[1:00:12] for your breakthrough
[1:00:13] so everything not just service days but
[1:00:16] every day we make preparation
[1:00:19] hallelujah because we are under
[1:00:22] expectation
[1:00:24] but they ran a man expectation so he
[1:00:26] sent here Noah he was expecting a
[1:00:28] terrine
[1:00:29] so he made preparations for the rain he
[1:00:32] said Oh make preparations as long as you
[1:00:34] hear courts would then make preparation
[1:00:37] for it to happen and weight under
[1:00:38] expectation or that makes me start
[1:00:41] feeling religious to think that God sent
[1:00:43] me be expecting it and if God has
[1:00:45] promised a revival here we're gonna have
[1:00:47] it let's make ready for it if God
[1:00:50] promised to heal
[1:00:51] let's make ready fit you don't have to
[1:00:53] make preparation for human kind of
[1:00:56] church say man but if I said Abraham and
[1:00:58] he started to make preparations for this
[1:01:00] child because if you're really expecting
[1:01:04] a child where do US attorney and what
[1:01:06] you have to so whenever I'm bored
[1:01:09] equilibrium and buy your toy however LC
[1:01:13] by he's showing that decision is he he
[1:01:15] really crazy is that what he were said
[1:01:18] it already believe is singular people
[1:01:20] could do one levy brambly because his
[1:01:22] life testified he believed it wrong way
[1:01:25] go this morning to the baby store where
[1:01:29] we're sitting are going after the
[1:01:32] groceries are going to the baby store I
[1:01:34] have to make up something you didn't
[1:01:37] hear our chat coming only see here I've
[1:01:44] already lost said now you know or if I'm
[1:01:45] going through way I mean when he was
[1:01:47] young for years he NCH on average have
[1:01:51] no it rammed all of us I'm gonna work
[1:01:53] when he rung a rail all and Sarah who
[1:01:56] couldn't have a child
[1:01:57] lol deported him walking around the mall
[1:02:00] happy happy happy buying baby this baby
[1:02:02] this baby this baby this
[1:02:04] yeah after year every city baby room
[1:02:08] because Abraham don't know what he egg
[1:02:10] on coming no think about it go ahead and
[1:02:13] tell him is 25 years so when he brought
[1:02:15] me here at Iran study car one time when
[1:02:18] stray 30 baby store because feet without
[1:02:21] works is dead and Abraham is the father
[1:02:23] of faith and he staggered not at the
[1:02:25] promise of God but was strong even
[1:02:27] Prince to God so when Abram I feel a
[1:02:30] feeling great you have a grab a child
[1:02:34] and we critics I will hear what you you
[1:02:37] know now after a few months
[1:02:40] Abraham could have shattered it was some
[1:02:42] of us after a few months you say Oh
[1:02:43] George I wonder if I might ask no but
[1:02:46] Abraham the next year because you don't
[1:02:47] have this is a year and hereafter you
[1:02:50] tonight this is the and yeah after yeah
[1:02:52] Abraham going you know which here and
[1:02:53] and I don't know how this is a serious
[1:02:56] thing you know because it's against
[1:02:58] human nature to maintain hope against
[1:03:02] hope because it's not as if K wrong
[1:03:04] getting younger every year and getting
[1:03:08] worse I want to think about it every
[1:03:11] year getting worse every hit harder to
[1:03:15] what he believed 20 years ago and yet 21
[1:03:17] reach say are you ready see we're moving
[1:03:21] a little slower she did 20 years ago
[1:03:23] yeah already let me go my next story
[1:03:26] because God said we gonna have a child
[1:03:28] way to make him preparation fit but at
[1:03:32] all of a sudden when at 25 years come
[1:03:34] you see the unveiling of the
[1:03:36] manifestation of the feet and they
[1:03:38] realize it was worth it for all
[1:03:40] hallelujah was worth it all and God
[1:03:42] didn't tell us what year he was gonna
[1:03:44] fill her she didn't tell us what he is
[1:03:46] gonna call her he didn't tell us what a
[1:03:48] year he's gonna keep you to break you
[1:03:49] what he ain't gonna get your new house
[1:03:50] what ya you gonna bless you abundantly
[1:03:52] he didn't tell you that but he want you
[1:03:55] to walk and fit and trust him and keep
[1:03:57] on living and fit it's gonna be well all
[1:03:59] is well you remember that that lady
[1:04:01] whose child died and she was heading to
[1:04:03] the Prophet and they asked her what is
[1:04:05] going on the area recognized that there
[1:04:07] they breaking his speed limit and
[1:04:08] they're gonna have demerits on your
[1:04:10] license you say all is well all is well
[1:04:16] can the church say man so if God has
[1:04:19] promised a revival let's make ready for
[1:04:21] it if God has promised a here let's make
[1:04:24] ready for it Oh hallelujah if Jesus said
[1:04:27] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:04:29] let's make ready for it move out
[1:04:32] everything get ready we're right in time
[1:04:35] it'll seem foolish
[1:04:37] well you not know you say well how is
[1:04:40] gonna happen in a deal like this and
[1:04:41] when all this I don't care what anything
[1:04:43] contrary is to that it's wrong we
[1:04:47] see it I see no above it look like but
[1:04:49] if God said so let's do it anyhow
[1:04:51] because God said so it'll happen anyhow
[1:04:54] I'm expecting it can the church say
[1:04:56] ma'am so I'm on the expectation for
[1:04:59] revival so I'm making preparation for
[1:05:01] revival that's what my expectation is
[1:05:03] I'm looking for a revival I'm looking
[1:05:06] for something to move I'm looking for
[1:05:07] the spirit to move in the face of what
[1:05:09] is happening everywhere I'm on the
[1:05:11] expectation for God to do something
[1:05:13] because we have had a minister of the
[1:05:15] word for all these years and the letter
[1:05:17] killeth but the Spirit is what gives
[1:05:18] life so we're looking for life to come
[1:05:21] into my life into your life life to come
[1:05:23] to your family life to come into the
[1:05:25] church a revival disturb the season but
[1:05:28] I bands had already planted Hannah
[1:05:30] church same an old-fashioned singing
[1:05:34] old-fashioned dancing old-fashioned
[1:05:37] shelton old-fashioned prena
[1:05:39] old-fashioned praising human you old
[1:05:41] fashioned week and the church amen
[1:05:43] Oh what but I've answered every five of
[1:05:46] causes five things do you remember
[1:05:47] easier if I will bring souls to Christ
[1:05:50] bring the church back to us the
[1:05:52] spiritual condition it should be in it
[1:05:54] brings back close communion with God it
[1:05:57] brings back the fellowship among the
[1:05:58] churches it brings back praying for the
[1:06:00] sick these are the five things that are
[1:06:02] if I Bourbons are you looking for
[1:06:03] revival in the church in your life kind
[1:06:06] of Church say man but if I said that's
[1:06:08] what we need tonight in making the
[1:06:10] valley full of ditches that's what we
[1:06:12] eat and that is a good old-fashioned
[1:06:13] Blackwood's simple and sky-blue religion
[1:06:16] bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] come the church say man Oh hallelujah
[1:06:23] hallelujah hallelujah I'm not gonna be
[1:06:26] too much long with you or whatever if I
[1:06:29] were to revive the seeds are planted in
[1:06:31] you sow the seeds had to be planted you
[1:06:36] know the devil has no power so he can't
[1:06:38] attack with power I can't attack the
[1:06:40] power
[1:06:41] so the Devils only weapon is to try to
[1:06:43] come against the wood to try to plant
[1:06:47] seeds of error but the bride cannot be
[1:06:49] deceived God out of it all easiest
[1:06:53] situation had to come so that we'll have
[1:06:55] the right individuals who would steer we
[1:06:58] do it friends if you're not
[1:07:00] making plans with a rapture start making
[1:07:02] plans for the tribulation if you do have
[1:07:15] a plan to be rapture you need have
[1:07:16] tribulations available because this
[1:07:22] whole gospel is on a plan for us to stay
[1:07:24] in church then I plan for it to become
[1:07:27] the best churchgoer Abbess to it it's

[1:07:54] to leave here can the church say man Oh
[1:07:58] hallelujah hallelujah let me get ready
[1:08:01] to wind down touch the scripture that I
[1:08:05] read on a familiar Scripture but it's
[1:08:07] really a scripture of preparation of
[1:08:11] getting ready blessed be the name of the
[1:08:18] Lord and shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:08:19] likened unto ten virgins which took the
[1:08:22] alarms I went forth to meet the
[1:08:23] bridegroom five wise and five foolish
[1:08:27] all virgins all holy all going to church
[1:08:30] all in the message all have the books
[1:08:33] all have the tapes all know the
[1:08:36] expectation all know the requirement all
[1:08:39] understand that the token is a life and
[1:08:41] I talked and supposed to be displayed
[1:08:42] and they have all these things but some
[1:08:47] were wise and some foolish all have the
[1:08:53] inspiration some inspiration some type
[1:08:56] of inspiration but some wise and some
[1:08:58] foolish all have access to the prophetic
[1:09:01] message all have access to scripture but
[1:09:04] some wise and some foolish Jesus himself
[1:09:08] Saturday debates about who is wise and
[1:09:10] who is foolish he said data for foolish
[1:09:12] talk
[1:09:13] and it took no oil with them but the
[1:09:16] wise took oil in their vessels with the
[1:09:18] alums in other words the wise made
[1:09:21] preparation there was something more
[1:09:24] that they did they were ready they did
[1:09:28] something more they put something else
[1:09:30] in please if you're going on a trip you
[1:09:33] have to make preparation I put them gas
[1:09:34] in your car you have a car
[1:09:37] we have no gas we're going doors that
[1:09:41] were foolish took their lamps with no
[1:09:43] oil it's like a start of your car and
[1:09:45] you have no gas but doors that were wise
[1:09:48] have a car but they fill it up with gas
[1:09:52] and a lot of people sit along in message
[1:09:55] churches and they think they're wise
[1:09:57] virgin we couldn't understand this
[1:09:59] mystery of the oil and this is the key
[1:10:02] of the matters but always said let's
[1:10:04] keep the main thing the main thing how
[1:10:07] books have tips have revelation have
[1:10:09] understanding of the scripture didn't
[1:10:11] know what the expectation didn't know
[1:10:13] about Rome didn't know about the plagues
[1:10:15] then nor were the files first will
[1:10:17] second but simple they have all these
[1:10:19] great knowledge and mysteries and
[1:10:20] revelations but you know what there are
[1:10:24] many Bible scholars who know all this
[1:10:26] stuff true but oil in the lamp oil in
[1:10:33] the lamp but it Branham taught us the
[1:10:36] oil represents the Holy Spirit the oil
[1:10:38] is in the church he always had a
[1:10:39] movement he always had a belief the oil
[1:10:43] isn't under a pastor that's the oil the
[1:10:45] oil is the Holy Ghost and it has to be
[1:10:48] in something can the church same and so
[1:10:51] they're different between the wise and
[1:10:52] the foolish was not what church you go
[1:10:54] into not who your pasta is not what
[1:10:57] keeps you playing church if you're
[1:10:59] playing tapes in the church and who is
[1:11:01] preaching and who is not preaching and
[1:11:03] if it's live or if it's not live or how
[1:11:06] long in the message or how long in
[1:11:08] church and what do you believe in it you
[1:11:10] really love God that's not oil
[1:11:14] how many courts you read there's only
[1:11:17] one difference the wise had oil and the
[1:11:20] foolish had no oil every Sunday people
[1:11:24] sit in church and in that church is wise
[1:11:26] and foolish because what separates our
[1:11:29] wives from the foolish is the wise are
[1:11:30] putting things in place by ensuring that
[1:11:34] they have oil in their lamps they do a
[1:11:36] little more did you little extra they're
[1:11:39] getting ready they get them prepared
[1:11:40] they don't know when they don't know how
[1:11:41] they don't know why but they get already
[1:11:42] somebody say man but I ran to the extra
[1:11:46] oil is the difference he said the
[1:11:48] difference is to token the token is a
[1:11:50] life is the fletcher's it's a Tumnus his
[1:11:52] voices it's charity because only the
[1:11:55] life can be received by the groom can
[1:11:59] the church shame and making preparations
[1:12:02] for the coming of the Lord it's not
[1:12:07] reading books that's on the preparations
[1:12:08] he's adding oil hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:14] hallelujah I said it some time ago I
[1:12:16] said co-author just what Mary teeth on
[1:12:19] the word day and night to meditate on
[1:12:21] something you have to know it before I
[1:12:23] can meditate on it so reading the word
[1:12:27] it will really grab a bit like he said
[1:12:28] you sleep or no but after you read it
[1:12:32] your meditate on it you read the prophet
[1:12:35] message and you know your meditate on
[1:12:36] what you read how is this helping me how
[1:12:39] is it supply-demand what do I need to
[1:12:40] change Lord I want to be more like your
[1:12:42] merit it you're going to pray a dm-
[1:12:44] you're here sermon tonight Lord I want
[1:12:47] the extra oil I want to have too much I
[1:12:49] would have it I want to have so much fun
[1:12:50] and I don't risk I don't want to be at
[1:12:52] risk and I just don't wanna convert
[1:12:54] Church I want to have everything I don't
[1:12:56] want to believe so many what I want to
[1:12:57] believe all it was so open no I help my
[1:13:00] unbelief
[1:13:00] take away the door perform surgery
[1:13:02] tonight in my heart I know what to
[1:13:04] measure it by my ruler I want your ruler
[1:13:07] Lord can the church say manases is this
[1:13:10] helping anybody tonight it's a reality
[1:13:12] in your workplace it's a reality in your
[1:13:15] house is a reality if nobody else wants
[1:13:17] it you want the extra oil can the church
[1:13:20] say man
[1:13:22] but at Branham in the token he said the
[1:13:25] difference between life and death was
[1:13:26] the token which are my life and death
[1:13:29] now you know because with all these
[1:13:31] plygs coming he said touch not my
[1:13:33] anointed touch that anyway the seal of
[1:13:36] God it ever was a time to make sure you
[1:13:39] have oily snow if there ever was a time
[1:13:42] to make sure that your walk is right
[1:13:44] with God
[1:13:45] it's know if there ever was a time to
[1:13:48] put the skills of life and where your
[1:13:50] life against the wood is know and see if
[1:13:53] you come up wanting hallelujah
[1:13:56] hallelujah and so will it be at the
[1:14:00] coming of the Son of God when he brings
[1:14:02] the bride out of the church heard what
[1:14:04] he said
[1:14:05] bride out of the church people believe
[1:14:09] that sitting in a message church means
[1:14:11] you are bride there's nothing to support
[1:14:13] that don't let any minister confuse you
[1:14:17] attendance in church doesn't equal
[1:14:19] private people have put their feet in
[1:14:25] men's faith and systems fit in church
[1:14:29] have hit in court have faith in court
[1:14:34] you must have the token personally
[1:14:39] displayed hallelujah but a bad sense now
[1:14:43] listen close this evening and see that
[1:14:46] isn't a token will be the difference
[1:14:47] there has got to be a difference so the
[1:14:50] only difference between the bride
[1:14:52] between the wise and the foolish would
[1:14:54] be the token you can have all the
[1:14:57] knowledge that's not the difference
[1:15:00] God is not comparing knowledge against
[1:15:02] knowledge your understanding of the
[1:15:04] sixth seal and the seventh seal endure
[1:15:06] the wars and the plays and the vials and
[1:15:08] the woman when God says the day I'm
[1:15:11] looking for the difference he said
[1:15:13] where's the oil somebody could come into
[1:15:16] the message for a war a month and have
[1:15:18] oil somebody for 30 years and have
[1:15:23] look at the Centurion he didn't grow up
[1:15:25] on another Church he didn't grow up in
[1:15:26] the temple but when he came with a knee
[1:15:28] to Jesus yes in all of Israel I haven't
[1:15:30] seen field like this unnecessary kaya no
[1:15:34] but I am your sat on a little temple for
[1:15:36] 40 years and he have no fear this
[1:15:38] Centurion has more feet in Luther's day
[1:15:45] the extra oil the difference the token
[1:15:49] of his day was the just shall live by
[1:15:52] feet those who broke out of what they
[1:15:56] were in and accepted that message apply
[1:15:58] the token for their D they did the extra
[1:16:01] for their day they invested what it took
[1:16:04] that needed to be invested to reflect
[1:16:07] what was required for that day they were
[1:16:08] prepared to meet the challenge of the
[1:16:10] oil for that day they had the
[1:16:13] extraordinary sealing but Abraham
[1:16:17] thought it was the same hole he goes in
[1:16:19] every age so Luther had enough of the
[1:16:21] Holy Ghost for justification then Wesley
[1:16:25] had were luta had passed some more there
[1:16:28] was a new difference because the season
[1:16:29] change so you couldn't go over to
[1:16:31] measure that you had from Luther's day
[1:16:34] into a CD you have to have more can the
[1:16:38] church say man
[1:16:39] the Lutheran's Wesley's message became
[1:16:42] the extra Wesley's message required more
[1:16:46] preparation more revelation a greater
[1:16:50] experience you have to know get the oil
[1:16:53] to meet the requirement because when a
[1:16:56] brand imported there was a blending in
[1:16:58] justice when John was there and Jesus
[1:17:00] was there there was a shift John is
[1:17:03] still preaching but those who saw Jesus
[1:17:05] started to follow Jesus and they were
[1:17:08] those who were still under John's
[1:17:09] ministry not realizing that the season
[1:17:12] had changed in some manner and Paul in
[1:17:19] acts 19 goes about he says unto what
[1:17:22] were you baptized hunter John's baptism
[1:17:25] because John didn't stop baptizing when
[1:17:28] Jesus came on the scene Jesus was
[1:17:30] baptized and he went on in his ministry
[1:17:32] was coming into view and John said I
[1:17:35] must
[1:17:35] so that his ministry could increase and
[1:17:38] so it was luta is fading away and then
[1:17:42] Wesley's message stripping in an extra
[1:17:44] oil there were those who would hold on
[1:17:48] to looters teaching but this is all we
[1:17:50] know this is all we have this is how
[1:17:52] it's been this is what Luther told us
[1:17:56] but there was oil that had to be put
[1:17:59] into lamps to meet the requirements of
[1:18:01] the age are you with me as we was one
[1:18:04] watch but around you as one watched
[1:18:07] feeling to the next watch doors that
[1:18:11] were alright and looters age had to make
[1:18:14] a choice to accept or reject the extra
[1:18:16] that Wesley brought it required a new
[1:18:19] level of preparation a new level of
[1:18:22] dedication it required a new level of
[1:18:24] sanctification because his message was
[1:18:26] one of sanctification the believers who
[1:18:30] will lose a church and understand the
[1:18:32] sanctification thing but no you had to
[1:18:35] be more ready more prepared more
[1:18:36] dedicated more consecrated more who so
[1:18:39] loud you have to give up more things
[1:18:41] because there was no oil required can
[1:18:43] the church same and anybody with me
[1:18:45] tonight
[1:18:46] I'm almost finished then the Pentecostal
[1:18:50] scheme and the gifts were restored and
[1:18:53] tongues and these things it was more
[1:18:55] extra another level another requirement
[1:18:59] another level of preparation another
[1:19:02] level of dedication and it's a blending
[1:19:04] in and in the height of the Pentecostals
[1:19:06] as they're exploding here comes a little
[1:19:09] profit brings the food the full light
[1:19:15] every mystery revealed and in the
[1:19:18] fullness of the world now requires a
[1:19:20] fullness of dedication a fullness of
[1:19:23] surrender a fullness of the spirit of
[1:19:26] match the fullness of the word because
[1:19:27] when a Branham taught that from that
[1:19:29] first age until the prophetic age told
[1:19:32] the conductor the wood had been lost and
[1:19:34] the power that should have been flora to
[1:19:37] the church curdled Florida way it was
[1:19:38] supposed to but when it's little 20th
[1:19:41] century Kentucky prophet
[1:19:42] began to preach here see the discrepancy
[1:19:45] serpent see the citizen air with the
[1:19:47] shocker
[1:19:48] adoption beginner pull these little
[1:19:50] things together and slowly slowly under
[1:19:53] the devil's eyes the devil announced how
[1:19:54] what is going on he was gathering here
[1:19:56] from Genesis from revelation pulling the
[1:19:59] pieces together try to catch the
[1:20:01] attention of a people catch the
[1:20:06] attention of virgins as it were but
[1:20:09] within their wise and foolish they were
[1:20:12] those who see the man who see the gifts
[1:20:14] who see what he performed and those who
[1:20:16] are listen to the words because I
[1:20:18] recognize is not even by the Branham
[1:20:20] he's pointing to Jesus it's about Jesus
[1:20:25] Malachi 4 introduced to talk on the life
[1:20:28] of Jesus Christ once twenty-five is five
[1:20:30] musicians get ready while the bridegroom
[1:20:33] tarried they all slumbered and slept
[1:20:35] while God has been preparing because the
[1:20:38] bridegroom went to prepare with Alma
[1:20:40] making preparations for the coming of
[1:20:41] the Lord
[1:20:42] while God is preparing they all
[1:20:43] slumbered and slept two different words
[1:20:46] slumber and slept and not the same
[1:20:50] wherever I'm type it out slap fall
[1:20:52] asleep slumbers waiting almost dozing as
[1:20:56] it were different sleeping already did
[1:21:00] but a Branham brother tapped the bride
[1:21:02] from the Seven Cities are sleeping but
[1:21:04] slumber means dormant inactive not
[1:21:06] moving waiting for something so it must
[1:21:08] mean the Living bride is slumbering
[1:21:11] slumbering in the message with books and
[1:21:14] tips slumbering in the message with the
[1:21:17] power because the word is power
[1:21:19] no wonder the prophecy it takes
[1:21:22] something to to give the bride seat so
[1:21:25] it's a week off some of us still into
[1:21:27] action can the church amen
[1:21:29] oh the tearing Christ suppose arise we
[1:21:32] who are alive we who are slumbering
[1:21:34] that's why but it Branham seven people
[1:21:36] fight the score the bride has done had a
[1:21:37] revival yet see there's been no revival
[1:21:41] there no manifestation of God stir the
[1:21:43] bride we are looking for it
[1:21:45] it'll take those seven unknown tunnels
[1:21:47] back there to wake her up again he will
[1:21:50] send it he promised it I'm under
[1:21:52] expectation for it I'm making
[1:21:54] preparations
[1:21:55] it I'm almost finished in other words a
[1:21:58] manifestation of behold the bridegroom
[1:22:00] comment will be seven thunders uttering
[1:22:03] their voices I'm trimming time because
[1:22:06] at the midnight there was a cry made

[1:22:15] seven angels come down from eternity the
[1:22:18] bridegroom is coming into view

[1:22:21] journey in the air to scream out in
[1:22:23] every age it was one message behold the
[1:22:26] bridegroom cometh but the last messenger

[1:22:36] tonight behold the bridegroom cometh go
[1:22:38] ye out to meet him behold the bridegroom

[1:25:49] what is a measure of your character and
[1:25:51] your understanding of the need to be
[1:25:53] prepared can the church say Amen trim
[1:25:58] the excess all the virgins so listen
[1:26:01] carefully wise and foolish trimming
[1:26:04] accessor it's coming up so close race
[1:26:08] I'm almost finished all all the food in
[1:26:13] the world but occurrence all trimmed
[1:26:16] their lamps
[1:26:17] all cut off things from the world all
[1:26:20] trim the excess oil making an effort
[1:26:23] it's a real effort they're not playing
[1:26:24] Church they want to be right and look
[1:26:28] around the land and they're people who
[1:26:29] love God they'll love the message and
[1:26:31] love the word doing the best he could
[1:26:33] but that's not the question is there oil
[1:26:36] in your lamp
[1:26:38] and it's after the trimming it's only
[1:26:43] after the trimming the question comes
[1:26:46] the foolish said to the wise give us of
[1:26:48] your oil because in the act of trimming
[1:26:50] in the act of cutting away what should
[1:26:53] not be there it allows you to look back
[1:26:56] at your life and reconsider have I done
[1:26:59] all I should do to make this rupture
[1:27:01] have I done everything I should do to
[1:27:03] make this cut and in cotton you realize
[1:27:06] you don't even when you take time to
[1:27:08] look in the mirror of the word and you
[1:27:11] said to realize I'm short of something
[1:27:14] I'm Maria I'm missing something after 30
[1:27:18] years in a message I have knowledge but
[1:27:20] have no oil I've information but no oil
[1:27:25] I have revelation got no oil and no
[1:27:29] mysteries and I don't have oil
[1:27:31] I know history and I have no oil I know
[1:27:35] where God brought us from but I have no
[1:27:37] oil and no bride history but I have no
[1:27:41] oil I'm living right I've trimmed and I
[1:27:47] have no oil I have a desire to serve God
[1:27:49] but I have no oil but Iban said he
[1:27:51] shakes at the D way young people come to
[1:27:53] the altar and they pray but across the
[1:27:55] line in other words it's too late no
[1:27:58] salvation left for them because the cry
[1:28:01] has gone out there's no more time to
[1:28:02] prepare the foolish said to the wise
[1:28:06] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[1:28:08] borne out what little they had listen
[1:28:12] carefully they had something but it
[1:28:14] didn't have enough because what they had
[1:28:17] went out so it's not that they didn't
[1:28:19] have or they never had something you
[1:28:21] know they didn't have enough have you
[1:28:25] done enough but the Branum scream that
[1:28:27] have I done enough have you done
[1:28:30] have we done enough but the wise
[1:28:34] answered saying not so lest there be not
[1:28:36] enough the issue becomes enough for us
[1:28:41] and for you but go ye rather to them
[1:28:43] that sell and buy for yourselves and why
[1:28:48] they want to buy what is this painful
[1:28:50] because this shows friends the desire to
[1:28:53] do right this is not these people want
[1:28:56] to go into the world they're not trying
[1:28:58] to go and drink and smoke and party
[1:29:00] they're looking now for oil but it's
[1:29:03] actually too late
[1:29:04] they now catch a revelation of what they
[1:29:07] should have been doing all along except
[1:29:10] that they caught the revelation too late
[1:29:11] because they were comfortable being
[1:29:13] virgins comfortable having what they
[1:29:16] thought was enough and not realizing
[1:29:18] that there was more preparation that was
[1:29:20] required and that this preparation
[1:29:23] should have been happening but was not
[1:29:25] happening maybe they were too busy maybe
[1:29:30] they were too busy I'm challenging us
[1:29:33] I'm challenging me I'm telling you
[1:29:34] tonight while they went to buy the
[1:29:40] bridegroom came and they that already
[1:29:42] went in
[1:29:44] are you ready tonight went with him to
[1:29:48] the marriage and the door was shut did
[1:29:51] that already
[1:29:52] be that already and afterward came all
[1:29:58] to the other food is in Lord Lord open
[1:30:00] to us but he answered and said verily I
[1:30:04] say unto you I know you not all your
[1:30:07] years in the message and the pain you
[1:30:10] get for it is I know you not because you
[1:30:13] did not pass the exam that was required
[1:30:17] what's there for watch therefore is a
[1:30:21] this is a warning now about being
[1:30:23] vigilant about being on point about
[1:30:26] being ready about not ever getting slack
[1:30:29] about not ever getting comfortable watch
[1:30:32] therefore for you know neither the day
[1:30:34] nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[1:30:36] cometh
[1:30:38] foolish version those that truly believe
[1:30:41] that they have what it takes
[1:30:43] they believe that they're going to make
[1:30:45] it but when the call goes out they
[1:30:48] realize you don't have enough they had
[1:30:50] oil they had something but it did not
[1:30:52] have extra they had experiences they may
[1:30:55] have had a booth they may have spoken in
[1:30:57] tongues they had oil but they did not
[1:30:59] have extra they had a small measure but
[1:31:03] the mystery filling of what was worked
[1:31:05] in a small measure can the church say
[1:31:09] man I'm finished in the breach between
[1:31:11] the seven church ages and the seven
[1:31:13] seals but abandom said for the trumpet
[1:31:15] of God shall sound at the last trumpet
[1:31:17] and when this last seal is broke and
[1:31:20] when the seven angel given his message
[1:31:22] the last trumpet shall sound and the
[1:31:23] dead in Christ shall rise and we which
[1:31:25] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:31:28] together with them to meet him in the
[1:31:31] air what's look.this my brother sees
