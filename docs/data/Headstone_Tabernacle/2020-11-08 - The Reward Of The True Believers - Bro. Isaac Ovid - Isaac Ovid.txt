service over to you now even as we approach your word lord may you have the preeminence me lord you break every chain every shackle upon the hearts and lives of your people father we dedicate this service to you today and lord the reading of the word in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen certainly wonderful here this morning if you have your bibles would you turn with me to one portion of scripture this morning reading from revelation 22 uh reading from verse 10 revelation 22 and reading from verse 10 revelation 22 and verse 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without or for outside are dogs and sorcerers and hormones and murderers and idolaters and who so loveth and make it a lie i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning sir and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear it say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testified these things said surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated in the presence of the law this morning certainly great to be in the atmosphere this morning and you have a right to create your atmosphere you have a right to create your environment this morning so for a title this morning the reward of the true believers the reward of the true believers and i'm i'm pulling that from revelation 22 and verse 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me it is not just he has a reward but is to give every man according as his work shall be can the church say amen so there's a reward that's coming to the true believers your believing will not be in vain your sacrifice will not be in vain your worship will not be in vain one time the scribes and the pharisees came to jesus asking him about the disciples and he switched on them and said in vain do they worship me so there are many people that are worshiping in vain but they're also individuals who are worshiping in spirit and in truth can the church say amen amen so just for an announcement we are back to regular services on wednesday nights so uh so the schedule this week will be bible study via zoom on tuesday regular service on wednesday night here and via live streaming and prayer meeting this friday via zoom so we are we are ramping up as we are allowed to ramp up can the church say amen we're an army and we're reporting for duty we are taking our positions because we're getting to leave here we are getting ready to go into this astronaut hallelujah this this rocket we are astronauts getting ready to leave this place amen and it won't be an indisciplined approach it's a disciplined approach to get ready to leave here can the church say amen so the reward of the true believers are you looking for reward hallelujah do you want to get the reward that god has for you for all these years he sent every prophet he sent was with a blessing and he brought prophets with judgment so it was always judgment and blessings blessings of those who stayed with the word and judgment to those who didn't stay with the world it's not a complicated thing it's a very simple thing and the more i look at the world i see the simplicity of this gospel how god is so simple he is so powerful but he is so simple it's not complicated people trying to interpret interpret interpret but the manifestation will be the interpretation we don't need to interpret it can the church say amen so i know there are many people who want to know what what what we're going to say about the u.s election and these things so that that's but the clarence that's above my pay grade you know why i've heard so many things over the years in the message i remember when hillary clinton was going up i think was against trump there were preachers all over the message saying hillary is going to win that's going to be the woman and i haven't seen many repent for making those statements people saying this people are saying that it's not my place to say this or that i know what the prophet said he said the catholic church is rising there's going to be a woman one day and there are people who are studying that but if your heart is not right to go into rapture that will not help you so i want to keep the focus this morning on what the focus is hallelujah everything has to find its place but the bride has to find her place hallelujah the unbelievers they have their reward also because they are wages to sin wage is a reward the wages of sin are still dead hallelujah but the bride has a reward also so i don't want to come this morning and spend all the time analyzing the political implications and the spiritual dimensions of what's happening over there hallelujah that has its place up but i want to be ready when the call to the rapture the call to the resurrection to call to the holy city oh hallelujah that's what i want to be ready for oh hallelujah the manifestation will be the interpretation that's all i need to know who god will move because he is in control nothing could happen listen you may be seated man so much happened people praying people doing all kind of things people the amount of false prophecies and change of prophecies i saw this week i went by my dad i swim look at this prophet change his prophecy one prophet said i prophesy trump will rin then he said i feel something change in the balance and if you keep up with it and it's so much and i say but how many people are really getting into am i right am i ready where is my reward what is my position what about my family i don't want to know about the us government election if my family is in trouble i want to know my family can make it into the act of safety i want to know that the blood is being applied on my house on my family i want my reward for being a true believer can the church say amen that's how i feel that's my understanding that's my inspiration that's my revelation we have to be ready the scripture we said behold i come quickly and my reward is with me hallelujah the time is short you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah you see this pandemic is doing a lot of different things a lot is going on you know but anthony i was praying trying to see where to go this morning and i almost brought a message about has the pandemic taken your worship because it's easy to get complacent it's easy to get into a routine it's a it's easy to be at ease in zion but when i read behold i come quickly and my reward is with me he is coming all of a sudden and he's bringing a reward it's not a reward to everybody it's not the reward to church members it's not the reward of message believers but as it will reward the overcomers who overcome the lust of the eyes they overcome the lusts of the flesh they overcome the no praise demons they overcome the political instabilities they overcome the economic instabilities because they know they come from another place where we have a different government where we have a different structure it's not by election and by votes but by predestination because he for knew you he could predestinate you and he he is the one doing the election and because he picked you because he voted for you before you even hear you have an appointment with the holy ghost tell me about the holy ghost this morning tell me about adoption this morning tell me about the power of satan being broken permanently not temporarily but permanently hallelujah the demons that hold you black i've got to let go just like moses the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever forever there has to be a last day that the devil has a grip on your life there has to be a line in the sand with the terence when your eyes pop open and the devil can't sit on them no more there has to be a day that the devil has to get off your children and cannot sit on them no more the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever forever forever hallelujah do you know that's part of my reward oh yes it is it's part of your reward your children are part of your reward they're making it is part of your reward your healing part of your reward adoption part of your reward spoken word power part of your reward behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work his work shall be his work shall be have you been working hallelujah he's not talking about your job yeah he's talking about your work in the supernatural realm and have you been working when god put man on the earth he put them to work the same word for work and worship is the same word that's the root word it's work is worship is a sacrifice it's a toil it's a cry it's a zeal it's pushing past how you feel give every man according to his work hallelujah it's a choice you have a choice this morning to stay dead or you have a choice this morning to be on fire you have a choice to be a church member or you have a choice to be a true believer but i want oil in my lamp you have to forgive me this morning we don't have too much time this morning but a punch but every minute we got i want to give the devil a punch every time you lift your hands you're pushing back up but at brandon said when you lift your hands up you defy the law of gravity i want to defy some laws this morning listen gravity is a law of nature so brother branham said you defy a law of nature when you lift your hands on worship and when you make it to the presence of god you are defying the laws of the nature of your first birth oh glory to god come on now [Applause] you may be seated for those who are not in the tabernacle make your house make your house a house of worship make your house a house of praise oh last night they're trying to sleep and the neighbor playing a whole set of braggadock music i try and i'm getting ready to preach today and i said look at this demon all kind of love music what kind of curse words and i say they in their atmosphere i can't get vex with them they're in the atmosphere so you want to get vex with me when i lift my voice and say thank you jesus for your grace for your redeeming power i may be tired but i'm still standing i may be at the edge of my rope but lord are tired or not and i'm not gonna let go my children get in trouble but i'm not giving up oh hallelujah you may be seated but it brand i'm talking about a time coming when the suns will push back cancer push back diseases you know those courts so you think god can't push back your arthritis you think you up your position can push back your female condition i'm not talking about laying hands i'm praying for you but i'm talking about the power in the church rising that's a reward that's part of your reward yes yes you will push back [Applause] push back when you driving home demons flying left and right because a son or daughter is coming through hallelujah nothing could touch you nothing can come nigh you oh hallelujah we gotta see german u.s power you are not creatures of time you are creatures of eternity we are turning back the clock tonight today [Music] you have to forgive me oh hallelujah reward of the true believers listen friends billy branham taught us that in every church every church no church is immune every church i don't care how big the church is i don't care what ministry is in the church so even when the prophet the greatest ministry that walk the earth after christ even when he was on the earth in his church in branham tabernacle there were three kinds of believers make no mistake about it true believers make believers and unbelievers and as optimistic as we'd like to be the reality is within every church is three kinds of believers you can preach as hard as you want to you can have every prayer meeting every day in every church we'll have three kinds of believers there are people this morning who said yeah i'm a believer and and and and they don't even recognize that they're make believer i'm not trying to weaken your faith or shake you up i want you to understand that god himself is defining true and make believers and unbelievers i just want to read back this script before i go a little further we already see it set up to me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book you know what don't lock it up anymore don't tie this up for the time is at hand if there ever was a time to be at hand it's now you see it all the plagues all the political realm the economic realm the sanctions everything you think next is going to get better see laws coming into place legislation coming into place where are you going to run to but in verse 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still in other words god is fair he he is immutable but iran said in his nature he is immutable in his ways which means he doesn't change [Music] he gives mercy before prolonged judgment every time that's his way he gives an opportunity before he gives judgment remember the branham was yeah he said america is finished we don't need to say it now that's that's already been spoken it's already settled he said america rejected god and you look around the world every country has rejected god churches have rejected god taken for themselves the commandments of men over the word of god having a false sense of comfort believing that believing the message or attending church is a criteria to make it but the true believers are about that word and about ensuring that word comes to pass in their lives because that's the identification of the true believers it has to produce a life it must turn into a life he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still friends if there's a day if there's an hour before god freezes this picture you get your life right with god hallelujah i challenge you this morning get your life right with god we don't know if we make it to 2021 we don't know he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be blessed be the name of the lord from the message michael the prophet brother branham said all true prophets the fact that he's using the word true means there's false i didn't know brother punch how many false prophets it had until this week my dad told me one who said he know you say i'm a major prophet all true prophet adam said all true christians all true believers stay with that word no matter what anybody says you stay right with the word they say the days of miracles is past don't you believe it for the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah i'm not accepting a substitute that's but always conviction i'm not accepting a substitute i'm looking for a manifestation of power hallelujah we're not in this message just to have word and just have teaching it has to be a display of power some people call it pentecostal you can explain that and theologize that and intellectualize that but he said he's the same yesterday today and forever and these signs shall follow them that believe i'm swallowing onto that hallelujah there are needy cases in this church that need a miracle today they need a miracle that's not a pentecostal statement hallelujah i need a miracle the message has put that as a pentecostal statement is there anybody needs a miracle you know what a miracle is when it's incredible but true and god can step into your situation and the doctors give up on you like that prayer request we read the doctor doesn't know what's going on ronda needs a miracle but we serve a miracle working god hallelujah he is still a healer he is still away maker oh hallelujah just to encourage you this morning proving his word notice it was by his believers that he proves his word he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh i believe brothers see if you do god will prove it see it's by true believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe i've met many people over the years who say they believe but they didn't really believe but it's by his believing children that he proves his word can the church say amen [Applause] [Music] but abraham goes on now he had believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish why every one of them but the believers who was left moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children there were only two that cross over and that was the believers joshua and caleb they was the believers there was the one who crossed over it's the only way god can do it is by his believing children and how do you know hallelujah your believer is when you keep his commandments it's when you follow his word it's when you don't compromise it's when you don't give up it's when you don't back down it's when you want to find out everything that god said concerning you again a sin in his hour concerning his pride in this day can the church say amen [Applause] oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory ma my mama my my listen to our word but the prophet put it and look at this in the context of the message this morning now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journey together huh all saw the same miracles of god all part took of the same manner and water from the smitten rock all followed the same cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night can i say that one more time so if you were measuring the activity you would say well they are qualified but look at it they all saw the same miracles so seeing miracles is not the criteria come on now all part took of the same manner they were eating the same food hallelujah coming to church and hearing the same messages come on now hallelujah and the water from the smitten rock all follow the same cloth by day and the pillar of fire so i'm following the pillar of fire and listen to them but only two reach the promised land only two were true or real believers that's a direct quote so it means there were two million people by the kangaroo following the pillar of fire two million people listening to the tapes two million people eating the mana two million people drinking water from the smith rock that's not water from a stream that is water that was provided to the prophet although he did it in a different way but it was it was an exclusive bunch of people and yet still after but ibrahim said they saw the miracles only two only two i wonder how many who sit in this message around the world will be making it that is correct but i said because the word tells us the rest died because of unbelief in other words you could see miracles you could sit in church and still have unbelief you could shake one another's hands you could have faith and don't miss a church service and still have unbelief so that's why we come this morning to speak against brother punch we come again to push back on belief push back every negative thought push back the devil telling you you're not gonna make it push back the devil telling you you're wasting your time push back the devil telling you you better we'll give up we want to push back that's what the preaching of the world is to do to cut the unbelief cut the unbelief cut the unbelief away until lord allah says that word seed pulsating can the church say amen hallelujah so whether the man have been spoken with his original seed hallelujah hallelujah now let us stand like joshua caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing that time now can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah improving his word now i want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers then in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age so but abraham is identifying that is a challenge in the age and they are individuals who are predestinated to be true believers to meet the challenge of the age you know what meeting the challenge of the age means it means you're not just backing down it means door we were locked on for months you're not gonna backslide and you're not gonna fall apart [Applause] you have to really check yourself you know i don't know if i'll say all that i want to say today but [Music] how god allows things to really test through believers because he will not give power to people who have not met his mark this age is too important this mission is too important all of redemption is hanging on this bride come on now dear without us cannot be made perfect god has not taken chances with this group of people if missing physical church for two months shake your faith till you do even how are you gonna handle when goliath come on when a real test comes come on now come on now hallelujah but ibrahim said did did it get you did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestined in malachi for his got to happen when he came over and predestinate anything that happened in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's gonna be there going to be a raptor she's going to be there he predestinated by his full knowledge see there's nothing going to stop it glory in the rejected king just laying a few quotes in here now listen you true believers in christ you true believers so he's not talking to everybody now you true believers in christ you true christians that believe in god and the supernatural and you'll see it friends throughout all the different bible studies and the messages it was just a few things that was missing that god has to keep dealing with all the time he said he didn't give me a whole heart he didn't fulfill all my commandments and because of that judgment because of that he allowed the enemy to come in because they did not close their ranks this is only kind of services people love to hear or preachers love to preach you know but the reality is you have to close your ranks you can focus on everything and you're leaving your window open and allowing the enemy in and out easy access into your house into your heart at ease in zion i'll just i'll just connect and just take it casual that's what i'm picking up in the spiritual realm any friends [Music] no urgency no no enthusiasm people just get accustomed to it you have to remind people to connect you have to remind people about your service but for the believers it's a test can you stand alone can you stand like just one caleb everybody else say we can't take it and you could say no i'm still a christian and it's not a local issue i've seen it all over young people who had a testimony every week that they loved jungle and the gods just dropped they just dropped because now the opportunity to gather and maybe get a charge the way they they used to girl charge and a little pick up on a sunday or so that's not the anymore brother joe and then and then you realize that they they were plugging into the experience of church and that has its place but god wants you to plug into him and you could tell if you're plugged into him because it vibrates over you it it moves you a certain way god is this whole year is about individuals now come on now this whole year has not been about churches it's been about individuals growing in christ have you grown are you growing is your faith higher than it was when this pandemic started oh oh oh [Applause] hallelujah i'm being pushed this morning hallelujah because they are individuals i know who have questioned trapped in this loop they connect online to work they connect online to this and churches has another connection oh come on now so it has become casual you're relaxing and taking any service there's no zeal there's no cry there's no burden there's no sighing and crying how many problems come home you'll get desperate now because you're recognized now you already need god but by the time you should have been investing in the vial of your prayers your vile empty there's no memorial stored up for you like cornelius had a memorial stored up in heaven when he brought his family together and he didn't even understand the fullness of it but he had a dedication he had a commitment he had a passion he had a burden and that burden touched god and god touched peter [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you have a memorial where's your memorial huh forgive me this morning for interrupting your expectation of your service hallelujah hallelujah but i don't apologize this morning hallelujah because we want to be ready we want to be ready whether we stand alone whether they lock us up again you got to get stronger not weaker hallelujah you're stronger not weaker [Music] i love the way the bible puts it samson made his mistakes samson made his mistakes he lost his eyes and they put samson in quarantined grinding at the mill hallelujah but as he was grinding by the terrance his muscles started to get stronger i just had to grind his head and get stronger and after a while he's got to get stronger instead of his strength are they come back until they could bring him back outside again hallelujah i want to see strong christians you could tell the devil no and you can say yes lord yes what i believe i believe more than i believed yesterday i'm not i'm not gonna let the devil take my praise i'm not gonna let circumstance take my praise i'm not gonna let the economy take my praise i'm not gonna let the country take my praise i'm not gonna let what anybody else did take my praise true believers can stand if nobody else in your house stands you stand hallelujah if your husband don't understand you stand if your wife don't understand you stand if your parents don't understand you stand if your children don't understand you stand [Applause] and you'll get your reward and in your reward you could bring your family hallelujah hallelujah that's a reward that he can give you but you gotta press you gotta press you gotta press in your home you gotta make time to pray you gotta press you gotta press you gotta press people satisfied with this intellectual gospel it's information they perception like lectures no much lectures i listen to but church has to be different you can't connect to a service like if you're connecting to a lecture [Music] it's about your heart throughout scripture you see they they they get it with their head or no but it's not in their heart and god allowed it to unfold like that i want to stick it i want to take it [Music] you have to be more disciplined how dare you lie down on your bed with your phone taking in these services really when moses walk into the presidency take off your shoes for the place you're standing is holy ground don't approach me how you want to do approach me casually recognize you in the presence of god [Music] himself if the high priest went into the holies of holies and god was not pleased it was dead he couldn't stroll back out i can't believe friends that there was a high priest who casually went in think of yourself if you are high priest brother anthony and you know that if god doesn't accept it you die wouldn't you be checking people wouldn't you be going to the elders are all your people accounted for because i'm about to go into the holy's of holies once a year we get to go in we had a whole year to prepare to go in i want to make sure because i'm not going in there to die now so double check because i want to make sure my sacrifice will be accepted and you want to take church as a casual thing the principle is the same take off your shoes for the place you're standing is holy ground in other words make this service a reverend service whether you're in the building or in your house or wherever you are don't take it casually god will judge you for that that's how you separate true believers or maybe they weren't unbelievers you know it's about your approach to god it's about your reverence to god it's about your respect to god hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer just trying to encourage you a little bit oh my but noah was a true believer we speaking about true believers this morning abraham was a true believer although they all made their mistakes they were true believers they were willing to give their all are you willing to give your all are you willing to give a hundred percent you know how hard it is to find people that give a hundred percent of anything are you really really really serious about giving a hundred percent but isaac why do i bring a mystery yeah because people are mystery given two percent job was a true believer the three hebrew words were true believers they were willing to die for what they believed are you willing to die for this that's what true believers you know you know they're coming at a time when they will shut down the churches but joe you imagine somebody come to your house and say um hear this now we we we have all the churches registered i think what church you win what do you believe because if you don't believe according to the ecumenical council and what we have is registered you know how many people are at the back battle as well you know where to be honest i used to like believe you know but it's not like it was like a it was like a real like firm film there were some good things in there but it's not like you know we did any bible study from proverbs the simple the simple wherever where when you push them too hard you give it back what you need to hear you know you tell them this thing wrong you say yeah boy you know you're right i didn't really know it had two wrong things in here you know and even those who say this thing is the truth is nothing but the truth it comes down friends having a revelation and i've realized that most people ready to have a revelation reading three books of the message 10 books 100 books 500 books and coming up with the intellectual conception of the message it's not a revelation of the message because the revelation is what they get out of the messages about the life that is your revelation you know do revelation is in life because that's what god fought for to get in life the life to say that's my spirit flowing freely do i have all knowledge and i have all the mysteries and i give my way to be born and i don't have this life i don't have charity i don't have love everything else it don't matter it has to come back to your life it has to come back to living living for god and not you saying i'm with the message but god's saying i am identified with you there's my beloved son my beloved son there's my daughter over there there's my son there she's working there she's working there but no you can't move her like god can speak about job god was so pleased with job he interrupted the devil walking around and said satan what are you doing walk around two and throw cause him back now he say have you considered job i see you're walking around but you're not doing my job at all have you considered job you're passing a wrong job house you're going to the leftover job you're not going to have you consider job you say well i consider job you know because you have a hedge around him so i know better than to pass by him i wouldn't go anywhere i see your protection like that you know that's how god feels about you he puts a hedge around you put the protection around you the devil had to get permission to come by you you didn't did the the devil just come into your house just so it can't work so you know you need permission to the devil show up in your neighborhood it means god already approves you to push him back it's whether or not you will take the challenge and say satan you got to go that's how you build your strength that but ibrahim taught us this he said when you say pull back you get stronger you never get weaker but what god is doing it's exercise it's exercise it's exercise your feet muscles exercise your revelation exercise your faith in god hallelujah so you have a little situation to pray and you see god work for you now your faith grows now you're willing to pray for something bigger you want to ask god for bigger things that's why brother branham could say how could you have faith for the rapture if your car fit for divine healing it means you must have faith for divine healing or you can't talk rapture so we have to see divine healing break out hallelujah and we have seen signs and signs and signs but god said missing limbs would be restored if god could take us to the rapture he could restore missing limb hallelujah you have to believe it hallelujah you got to accept it oh hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer with you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord from the message thy seed but imam said that's the reason we find our organization's feeling by the wayside it's because when it comes to the to the test what tests god's word there's a test and it's simple you know god's word is the test will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what god says do that's the difference who hallelujah but ibraheem goes on in events made clear by prophecy he said but the bible is a living foretold witness of jesus christ and as the earth has grown into its fullness and also vines grow into their fullness the day grows into its fullness the bible was manifested in its fullness in the person of jesus christ he was the word of god revealed the whole complete book of redemption the bible is god's word for telling the future events its believers is commanded by its order to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one word to believe it you might as well quit trying until you believe that word you see what i want to know along here every word is absolutely a part of almighty god god made a manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is we are commanded as believers to believe every word of it and it's wrote by the order of god himself there's nobody can add anything to it or take anything from it oh my he said if you would it would make a freak body of god it would have maybe six fingers on one hand or three arms or something to add something to take something away from it and be one short arm one short it's the complete body of jesus christ hallelujah and the true believers in this world who accept it that we believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises every one of them to be manifested in its age hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord oh but abandonment is bernie and church age it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without that spirit you are reprobate can i say it one more time it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without that spirit you are reprobate in other words you're a rascal you're no good you're a troublemaker you are none of his hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm getting ready to wind down in the same message money on church age but abandon said not too long ago i asked a lady if she were a christian she said to me and you you know this quote i will have you nurse no sir that i burn a candle every night what in the world has that got to do with it i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a pentecostal that has got nothing to do with it it's the holy ghost or perish hallelujah and that's what i want to nail down this morning it's the holy ghost or perish hallelujah i want every reward i want every promise i want every promise in the book and the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my let me be into wine now well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on god you imagine the deeds of the nicolaitans began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word to the word as a pattern and if you cut to the pattern then your life's supposed to have that same pattern you can't be cut from the part in your life not lining up with that pattern hallelujah all it takes is just one word change and that little eleven then levels the whole lump he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all eve just changed one word and when that listen to the prophet satan centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the true believers insisting that they were aliens of the church notice how organization breathes hatred it destroys fellowship it makes bitterness that is what myrrh means this is what smyrna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more and more definement was coming every age would feel its scars that's money and church age had drifted far from the original it had become a hybrid it had hybridized itself the way eve did you know what a hybrid is it comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original that's why i'm preaching so hard against mixing with the things of the world and mixing with all your ideas and mixing with your own interpretation it's the word or nothing well when eve allowed the beast to mingle his seed with hers she produced a creature called king that wasn't pure human he was of the wicked one notice how different he was from abel notice how different he was from set he hated god and would not obey the word and persecuted and killed the righteous he set himself up above the word of god and but abraham goes on the church too has departed from what she originally was she is a hybrid that is the church nominal is a hybrid people say i'm a baptist and now they say i'm in the message it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of god instead of spirit-filled men in the church who were led by spirit given revelation they are now creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men and you see it all over learning has taken the place of revelation reason has replaced faith programs have replaced spontaneous praise in the holy ghost [Music] you know what brother obama said there's no substitute for this holy ghost you can't put a program in place to do it hallelujah you could have youth services and this and that your young people need to meet the pillar of fire it is not to educate them they need to meet god just like moses bent a pillar of fire and from that five minutes in the presence of god it changes walk it changes talk it changes life the musician can get ready oh hallelujah and when the church becomes hybridized will it produce pure christians it can't the life or seed that brings christians to birth is not in them like brings forth like the baptists bring forth more baptists and they act like baptist methodists bring forth pep methodists and they act like methodists not one is known by the power of god nor can they be for it's not there they are known by their ceremonial worship and their creeds and dogmas message will bring forth message but the original word the original seed the original gospel will bring forth true believers with the original power oh hallelujah the original word the original seed will produce your original life and only the true believers will receive the original seed and were germinated by having true worship to see that light come to manifestation oh hallelujah i'm almost finished [Music] oh glory glory glory glory glory oh my my my did you get it now in the ephesian churches they are those twins again they are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment this nourishment of this message drinking in the same rain benefited by the same sun but they come from different seeds oh one tree is for the word of god exactly as god gave it that's a tree oh my that's what i'm talking about this morning one tree is for the word of god exactly as god gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is untied the word of god and changes it where it wants to hallelujah you like this part of the world but but you don't believe this so and you don't want to do this so and and you're still messing around with the world and this way you're taking somebody that's a different seed it substitutes its own creeds and donbas for the living true word exactly as dead cain who ended up killing abel hallelujah oh my but fearing a little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil oh that's the message this morning keep that word between you and the devil that's the attribute of the true believers eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the wood she goes into the depths of darkness oh my i'm finished this morning oh are you looking for your rewards oh my my my brother branham taught us that in every age there were rewards for the overcomers hallelujah in the laodicean age they had they overcame in every age overcame oh hallelujah hallelujah revelation 3 5. oh this is your promise now and i'm reading them he that overcome it hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not plot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels so to the overcomers your name will not be blot out you shall be clothed in white raymond revelation 3 12 him that overcome it will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out no more backsliding no more car find you no more you don't know where you stand and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which coming down out of heaven from my god oh blessed be the name of the lord revelation 3 21 to him that overcome it will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame i'm speaking about your rewards this is jesus christ revelation 2 17 he that had an heir let him hear with the spirit say it unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the hidden manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man know it saving he that receive it hallelujah revelation 2 7 he that had an heir let him hear with his spirit satan unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god these were promises to the overcomers in every age but now in our day all the promises of every age are gathered in this time the time of the manifestation of the seven thunders
