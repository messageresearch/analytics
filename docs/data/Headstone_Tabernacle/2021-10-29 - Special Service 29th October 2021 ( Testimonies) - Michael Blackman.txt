want to have is from sister june redhead i know many of you may have known her she came in just during the pandemic and everybody's wearing masks and everything else and um you know it has been quite an experience with this pandemic and to see how god could do that work and and bring her through we certainly appreciate her coming forward and willing to give a testimony by the grace of god so we want to invite her praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord we want to invite her to this one minute i am here okay god bless you sings i'm a little bit nervous so bear with me um and i had to make some notes because i'm not a freehand speaker i just want to give honor and glory and thanks and praise to god for his love his mercy and his faithfulness it's because of his mercy that's the only reason why i'm still here alive and restored today and i also thank god for good praying parents they are no longer here with us but um i'm i know when they were they prayed a lot for myself and my siblings and i thank god for restoration just to give you a little background information on myself um i was brought up in the message ministry however due to certain things that happened at the time um when i became of age and an adult i couldn't wait to bolt and i did right into the world at that time i didn't even want to hear anything about church or message or anything associated with church um during this time while out there in the world i recalled um having a recurring dream you know um i don't believe in dreams and stuff too much but my this dream was exactly the same each time i probably had it about three or four times over the years you know and it was exactly the same it was um it was judgment day and i was standing before god to give an account of my life and each time in the dream i would bargain with god to let it be a dream and if it was a dream when i awoke i promised to change and each time i would a week you know and um in cold sweat you know i know i'm just because it seems so real however when the effects of the dream were off i would return to life as usual doing my own thing um i fast forward to the year of 2006 between 2006 and 2008 there about it was a period in my life where i think my life two in a corner somewhat i lost about six persons who were very dear to me one of them um the last one the last death in 2007 there about late 2007 was a very dear friend of mine who um who worked with me she was only 26 years old and she literally just dropped dead and at that time i just felt like god was speaking to me you know june it's time to return um her death had a very profound effect on my life and at that time i say god i give up um and just like that you know all the desires of the things of the world i mean i loved carnival for someone who didn't grow up in it you know i just loved it and partying and just doing my own thing and just like that i just started losing the desire for it um i couldn't explain it but it must have been god working on me and around 2008 early 2008 i just started looking for church to fellowship and for some reason i just could not go back to a message church so um i went to a couple pentecostal churches and it just wasn't sitting right with me and um eventually i've i've visited a ministry that's liv that's close to me i live in diigo martin and this ministry is in pity valley about 10 minutes away from my home and there was something about the way they worshipped that um it kind of drew me and you know and i stayed there for um for quite a while until last year um fast forward again to 2018 i had an experience of god's supernatural healing in my life and just like that one day i began experiencing severe pain in my left thigh and the pain got progressively worse at one point i was consuming like about 18 pillars a day and the pain had gotten so intense i was experiencing problems walking and needed um a cane to walk i would go to work and not be able to sit for very long so my doctor had recommended that i go on complete bed rest until she found like what was going on because my side was in addition to pain in me it was extremely swollen so she had sent me forearm on mri and the result came back on that i had edema which is like um i think it's like inflammation in your joint and i i almost felt like i was um becoming a um a triple because of how i felt it was like a tear and pain you know and at that time you know i would be home sometimes and the pain would be so severe i would get because all the painkillers that my doctor gave me nothing was working i would stand up you know walk up and down the corridor of my house you know and just be calling on the name of jesus and to me when i called on his name the more i called on his name the pain eased and um and one time um i started taking i stopped taking all the prescribed medication that she um that she gave to me and i say you know what i'm gonna consecrate myself and pray and it was then i found on my youtube channel with um messages from brother branham and i just began listening to the messages and i recall listening to our message on faith ones where the prophet referred to faith as the sixth sense you know um he called it the sixth sense or the supersense and i just held on to that and just kept dwelling on that and eventually you know i just had a claim in my healing he had um some of his services online were um healing services at the end you know and i just started putting myself in that situation and claiming my healing and just like that the pain disappeared from having severe pain and couldn't walk and stuff you know i the pain just went and fast forward to 2020. i'm just trying to make this as condensed as possible um then came covered in 2020. i was out of the country because i do a lot of travel for my job and i was out of the country when um trinidad announced his first private case i barely made it back into the country many days before the lockdown and i had so of course i had to go into quarantine um which was not too much of a terrible time because i didn't think you know that i had contracted covert um however the first period of lockdown came along and then the second period came around and i had to continue going to work because um i work for a u.s foreign minister the u.s embassy and their service is considered um essential so and i work as a customer support in the it department so i had to go to work and one day one of um my colleagues came in we have like three buildings um that we work with around the savannah and down the cipriani boulevard and she worked in one of the other buildings so it was a surprise to me that she came to this building i work in the main building which is where people go for visas and stuff and um she asked me for support and i went to her i was wearing a mask and um she was not but i noticed that she was coughing myself and another girl were there with her and i asked her i said why are you here if you why you puffed why are you here in coffee like that she said oh i just started coughing the night before but um this is not anything to do with prove it so you don't have to worry but so i stayed with her about 30 minutes and it was a friday never forgot that and um on the sunday sunday night i got a call from my management officer and it was one of the toughest calls i've ever experienced he told me that um i was a primary contact of someone who who was um who had to be tested for covert and they would call me back if the person is positive but from that day i had to stay in quarantine and this was myself and a few of my other colleagues and um [Music] so we connected with each other and you know kind of was each other's support and even we convinced ourselves that this person was not going to be covered positive but anyway on the wednesday we got the call that the person was indeed positive and satan is such a busy man all kinds of i mean we all started experiencing symptoms immediately phantom symptoms you know and um through the soul you know i um it started really playing on my mind and i had i think i started having a lot of anxieties you know and again i started immersing myself in in um in the profit messages and then one day i was speaking to a sister who was in the church where i grew up sister leah and she fellowshipped her brother rata and george's ministry and um i you know i was telling her what i was going through and stuff and um she said you and i will sign up a prayer for you um and i started tuning in to brother rotten george's um tuesday night services which was on i think he has prayer services on a tuesday and he prayed with me and i felt a little bit better but the anxiety was still there you know and um during that time headstone tabernacle kept popping up on my feet and that's how i started listening to her because i knew nothing about brotherhood and stuff my cousin timothy just to back up a little bit who's in grenada i know he was connected with the church here but i didn't know the details of it you know he would come here we would um he would stay at my brothers and we would talk and stuff and i know he would go off the santa grande at the church anyway um during that time of the the um the lockdown with me the commenting um coming to the end of the quarantine um it seems like all the anxiety that i was feeling just caught up with me and i had um one day i just decided to test my my pressure because i wasn't feeling too well and my pressure was um had gone to i mean this is from someone who usually has a pressure of 114 over 73 you know at its worst i usually have like they tell me teenager pressure um my pressure was 173 over 115. so i knew something was wrong and i i called upon my brother no who lives in the states he's a doctor i called him up and i sat down his name is jairus i said jairus um i don't know what's going on but i'm reading this pressure machine and you know i took it a couple of times and it's reading and i told him what it was and he's a very calm person you know and he said um he said june um do you have any aspirin at home so i said um yeah she said go take an aspirin right now and he said um just get yourself an emergency room immediately because you're in danger you said a number that's the bottom number which is 115 you were in danger of experiencing a stroke right now so um i took the aspirin and i went to um west shore medical the a um admittance and they um they admitted me but before they did so i was sitting in the arm in the waiting room and i didn't know that one of their protocols was to do a cover test so i was there waiting and the next thing i saw someone come a doctor and took me into a room and she said um you know i have to do a prover test but that's all i needed to hear my pressure just tuned up to over 200 and uh she took the ramp up test and um there i was waiting on the results in 15 minutes they got the result and i was negative you know i know but the anxiety and everything you know the pressure don't just come down you know i know to make a long story short i um i went through a process where my doctor had to i had to see my family doctor and she went through putting me on a monitor because my pressure was just high and she put me on medication it would fluctuate and just go up high and um she told me this is the worst kind of pressure to deal with you know um pressure from stress and she eventually um put me on a monitor to see what was really going on with me and through that time you know i was just praying and saying god just deliver me and of course listening to the messages all the time and tuning in to the services i started tuning into headstudent tabernacle sunday services after the tcc services that i was attending and when she got back the results from the monitor she said jim you don't have a problem i'm taking you off all your meds you know and um after that just like that everything just normalized you know um and i promised god i said you know god when this lockdown is over i'm going to visit a church i didn't say that i was going to stay i said i was going to visit either brother george's church or headstone tabernacle as i was listening to the mastery services online and um it so happened when things reopened brother george i think had like a rusted service you know so i didn't want to infringe and um i was speaking to my cousin and grenada tim and i said you know tim tell me my brother um we're headstone tabernacle services in ghani um he said you and hold on i'll contact somebody and they'll call you back and i guess he contacted brother ovid and who contracted with a black one only to realize brother blackman is practically my neighbor and he said um you can ride with me to go you know um and i said okay good because i really don't like driving long distances so i had no intentions of staying at headstone tamilnadu i just found it was just too far away from me and um and to cut a long story short here i am still you know um and i give glory and thanks to god i just like thank you for your welcoming and and i i really enjoy the services and i think this is where god wants me to be because my i remember timothy telling me um said you and that's a good place to go and you should go there and i said timothy i'm just leaving it in the hands of god he will lead me and i believe that he led me here and just to give you a quick um one quick um testimony i hope i'm not overstaying my time um a couple just about a couple months or so ago i um i had the opportunity to apply for a promotion at my place of work and the promotion was advertised and i went ahead and applied for it um we have an online system to apply and i wasn't aware that the online system requires that you fulfill all the prerequisites or else it can reject your um your application anyway i submitted on my application but before i did i remember someone that brother isaac preached anyone he talked about um whenever you are going to you know in certain circumstances you should always like calm but god say god i acknowledge you and whatever i am going to do you know and i started putting that into practice even before this situation so before submitting the application i said god i acknowledge you and submitted this application and i will tell you after what i submitted the application a day before the deadline and as soon as i submitted it um about an hour later the hr manager called me now the hr manager and i were not friends um we were not enemies but we were not friends i didn't think that she would look out for me um and it's so strange back up a little bit before that you know i was just like trying to i was praying that god would cleanse my heart from having anything against anyone you know give me a spirit of forgiveness and i was mentioning her name in it you know and other colleagues in the office you know who i felt i had things in my heart again what i don't know but i still prayed about it and this is the person who called me she said um she said june you know there's an up there's uh an opening in your section you know um are you planning to apply for it and i know she called me saying this knowing that she had already seen that i had submitted my application and i said well yes i am as a matter of fact i just showed you a few about an hour ago submitted my application and she said oh you did i said yeah she said okay hold on let me check it and she checked it and she came out she said june june you have something wrong in it you have something wrong you know this is someone rejected so i said i did she said um yes she said pull it back and fix it so i said well i didn't know i could pull it back but i said what furthermore what am i gonna say so i said as far as i knew i submitted what i needed to submit i said there was one of the prerequisites which was a certain degree and i know i did not have it so i um but i put all the other qualifications that i have she said well i can't really tell you because um that will be given you an unfair advantage but then she relented and she said but june you do have a degree i said i do now we usually go to the um to virginia there's a campus in virginia to do it training and stuff she said all that training that you've done over the years is equivalent to um to a degree she said just go and pull back the application check that you have a degree and submit your transcript from the tom campus so i did that and um she said on when you do that just call me back tell me that you submitted it and i'll check and tell you if everything is okay so i did that and submitted the application again and called on tool now that i did and um she called me back and she said good june you did you did good the application is perfect now and um by the next by the monday because the friday was the deadline the monday she pulled and she said you were selected for an interview so i went into the interview and again i acknowledged god in the interview and um came out and by the next day i got a call saying that i got the position so again i just want to give glory and honor to god i mean it may seem small but um to me i know it was a big deal and and i see god's hand in it because as brother i was telling brother blackmon about the testimony after it happened and he told me he said you know june god cares about the things that you care about you know and um and i thank you by the black man for that and and i think that is i give glory and honor thank you brother ovid for another isaac for giving me this opportunity and i hope this testimony has served to encourage someone thank you praise the lord gideon okay i trust that you could hear me at this point i was just a slight technical glitch sister june i i think we want to say god richly bless you on behalf of everyone here all the listeners both present tense and those who see it afterwards i think it truly was a blessing i think it underscored as well the fact that jesus christ is seen yesterday today and forever you heard you heard for yourself present tense testimony is here and she really honed into a whole host of things like faith how she held onto certain things listening to the messages as well practicing something she would have heard as well so i think it really really was insights insightful and i i think we feel like we know you a whole lot better now we also know that brother tim is your cousin now alright so great to have you here and great to have heard the testimony that you shared i know she also mentioned brother blackmon um and his rule in her coming up to grant to granny and fellowshipping with him and stuff and it is it was a coincidental it's interesting that the next person that we would like to ask to share a testimony is brother michael blackman himself he's a man who needs no real introduction he operates at such a professional level in so many varied capacities as it relates to the international convention we would lose um as a musician as well and and a coordinator and facilitator i know he does a whole host of other things so without much ado let me invite brother blackburn to share with us hi goodnight hi am i on yes okay so i just want to share a couple testimonies with you any given time um first i just want to give a little background in terms of of my my own background and that that is because i think the testimony that i share i wanted to understand the background that i came from when i came to the lord just prior to that i was an atheist i didn't believe in the existence of god i was marxist and i was a leader in a marxist underground movement in those days some of you all might be too young to know but it was against the laws of the country to to be to be marxists we were communists we were the first communist party in trinidad so everything had to be organized underground and i was the cell leader you could be arrested for just having marxist literature um so i didn't believe in god at all and i worked with military and we were saying the same things and he would quote from the bible and i would take it from a moral and ethical standpoint so then i came to the law but that's just a background so i just wanted to keep that in mind when i talk about some of the things that god has done let me say just up front that everything that has happened to me that has been good god did it it's a song that i listen to almost every day now um so you know just recently we were in the in the bible study you were the last one we were dealing with deeply and the next day and i went back into it and i was i was reading ahead and back on you know all over um those those scriptures that we were studying and i looked again at david fighting the beer and the lion and you know just recently i was looking at something called one of the animal suggestions animal planet and people were given survivors people who survived animal attacks and one lady spoke about being attacked back there and when she spoke about the ferocity of that bill hearing her bones and her head cracking under the grip of that bill the bear ripping away her face seeing things on the ground and realizing that it was her joy and seeing a river of blood running something running on the ground and realizing that she was bleeding out when i thought of the ferocity of appeal and having seen some of these shows on lions and stuff the first thought that went through my mind when i was sitting in my group home early in the morning reading that scripture was that this is almost impossible for this little boy to actually you know slay this bill lastly this life so at that point you know something came back to me when my mother-in-law had said to me you know michael you know a lot of these stories in the bible they're just parables they're just allegories they're just stories that amount you know to give us other paragraphs you know like he subscribes and as that thought came another thought came right after he is the god of the impossible so i was saying you know but this is impossible it's always impossible for this young boy to slay up here and a liar and right away they told him he is god of the impossible and you know just prior to that brotherhood had asked if i wanted to give a testimony i said yes i know so many different things that have happened in my life that i'm not trying to figure out which one right or what god said to me that is what you will testify you will testify of the god of the impossible and you will testify of the things that he has done in your life where it seemed impossible so i kind of put them in chronological roles when i just come to the road my son jabari had a severe case of taunts tons it's called adenoids and really bad he would get it i would have to go to my cousin and always was a pediatrician she would give him antibiotics and it would be good for a while and then it would happen so after that happened for several years she came one day when i went to she said this this is chronic it has to come out and she gave me a letter to go to a doctor and not circular root call doctor was a specialist when i went to dr akan he just opened her body ah shauna torchlight and he said it has to come out um so we i had to go and carry to barry to be weird and stuff but in my heart i just felt like i didn't want him to be operated up i prayed about it and i asked the church to pray about it and um i didn't i didn't go on with him and he was good because he took me antibiotic but as some while later maybe a year or so later he got a really severe attack again and um this time you know antibiotics nothing you know he was just fever and pain and stuff and i said to the lord you know during that time i had gotten a word from the lord through a muslim person guy who's a mecca you know and there's one of the things that i want to say to the god can use anybody to speak to you once you have your ears spiritually open your heart and this guy from this this muslim doctor who lives in the street lived in my street um he just said something about asked me about jabari and i said that you know he has this and he said um don't worry about it he growled a bit and i took that as a load so that when this other attack came a year or so later i put her fleece before they go i said listen the first time that barney had this attack i was a young christian i was very fanatical i threw away his meds i said this time of fever should not go more than three days if on the third day the fever doesn't go i am going to carry when they're going to take out his tonsils on the third day we had a sleepless you having we had church was in a bakery on de la rule and i told you about i said i will put in a prayer request for your syllabus or you can go and he said he would go seven years old six or seven years old i said well you know you don't have to go if you're not because i knew he wasn't well he was hiv it was just the partner but he insisted that he wanted to go with us and we went to this service and we and you know joanna carried into the crying room and there was such an anointing on his syllabus from the song so this is the end you know they prayed for him and so on that we forgot about him actually but normally if anything had happened our sister would come across so the other service i said to the drugs you know we haven't checked the barrier at all so joann went into the crying room and jabari was as cool as a cucumber and that was the last time jabari has had a problem with his sponsors the last time so you see one one doctor said then i asked when can't you do anything said no it's not possible dr khan said because that was the first thing i wanted is it he said no there's no way he can keep it it has to come over but god proved that he is god of the impossible i'm going to give you another testimony just a little forex problem i don't know i'm doing anything chronological order one night we went by my mother to watch some clothes our machine was down and when we came out i had just bought a mark too a car second car and when we came out the car was nowhere to be fought rain was falling before we fell asleep there by her there's two kids there's our two children and um there was no car to be fought so i asked joanna probably she had moved the car and i would do so though so the car was gone stolen the very next year when i went into school where i was working um there's a muslim guy who you know i will talk with and so on and i said to him sammy call the guy that i was i said samuel somebody stole my car last night and he said to me so how are you looking so happy and joyful i said well so he watched me i said yeah he knew my testimony right you know he was a christian right he said what the lord will bring it back here now i say correct he said so why did nothing tell you when it was spent it was being stolen i said because the lord didn't tell job anything either it that was my answer to him i said he wouldn't tell joke anything either do you know that i got back my card the first the next day now before that happened samuel did everything to tell me it would be impossible for me to get that my car his wife voted an insurance company at the time it was home insurance and someone sat down there and told me about the number of people who had lost their cars and that they would carry in those days they would carry a kind to the k they would strip it and then they would burn the chassis so that you couldn't find the chassis number and once you couldn't get the chassis number the insurance could not cover your plate so you basically told me forget it you will not be getting back your car the very next day i had my car and as i drove into the school the first person i saw was something his eyes were as wide as a saucer so you know i that was my testimony to him so he shook his head and he said boy are you real lucky i said ready you call it luck sometime after that he challenged again and i said that i had to get a place and i had to i could only pay five hundred dollars he told me here you'll get a place but without talks because in those days i stood studio apartment cost eight hundred dollars sister boys had just rented one for her for her mother eight hundred dollars in belmont long story short i got one for the same price i said five hundred dollars when the man handed me you're a very lucky man because the the woman who owned the house her son wanted it for his girlfriend he didn't know why he was giving it to me call him look i just smiled on myself because i knew it wasn't up and of course i didn't have one talks i had two bedrooms and not only that i had a water tank and a bell and then it was actually renovated for the same price so again samuel said it was impossible for me to get anything around tomorrow i told him i had to be a wrong talk because i was living santa cruz and i couldn't have been traveling he said it was impossible and god showed he was going to be possible of the impossible gonna go forward again there came a time when we needed our own place we needed together please so we went and we started to rent this place and within two days a guy showed up from the bank and said that the place that we were in was belong to the bank and we would we will rent him from our man with a banker full closer it started us on a whole trek i remember going back to church it was very you know kind of full on because you know we have been all over the place and i said to sister griffin as an older sister what's called sister voices mom i said to her you know the place that we went into we have to move and she said no brother blackman you put your foot down wherever you put solely on foot is yours you claim that and that all sainted sister really fired me up so i accepted that my faith rose but i still had this situation on my hands long story short i had to go to fcb because fcb were the people who were foreclosed on it was i think it was ncb at the time i was able to talk to the manager the manager the director of ncp the ceo a guy called arnold piggott he became a government minister afterwards his words to meanwhile it is not possible so i asked him i said what is the situation with these units because there were six stone houses our things weren't even on practice yet he said but the first thing again we are not renting those thumb houses we are selling them and the one you're in is sold so it's impossible so there's nothing you can do for me he said no it's impossible for you to get one they're all taken that one is sold and i advise you to put on your jet skis and get up as fast as you can or your family will be on the road for christmas what's this words besides even speaking frankly he said your family will be on the road by christmas if you don't put on your jets he's a ghetto so of course you know that that was my last hope so i'm thinking you know yes this thing is what i will call because you know i've accepted my faith and then i went and i got this this brick wall and one day you know with all these different things went to my mind as we still got the house i am walking waiting for a taxi and i'm speaking to myself audibly and i said wow you know this was exactly what i prayed for i prayed for certain things you know definitely i wanted a certain number of bedrooms because i had one daughter she needed an old space i prayed about the size of a yard i prayed about the place where the hall should be everything was exactly what i prayed for and i said imagine i pray for all these things and then this thing comes exactly how it is supposed to be all of a sudden there are giants in the land and as i said that were giants in the land right away something just went through boom and i said oh my god here it is that we read about it and here i am doing the very thing that god got so annoyed with them for i had seen god's hand with the mark twice he got down with jabari the apartment why was i adulting god at this point and the word giants is what brought it home to me because it was really chance in iraq i said no i understand why god was so you know so so angered them because i was doing the same thing and i i used to sit on watching and the prophet always spoke about we look at the bible we will see when we are actually living it all so here i was saying how could these people actually be dismayed by giants in the land and here i was in my time in my trial in my time going into the promised land just what i had prayed for god had given it to me and i saw giants and i was you know and i went back home i turned around in the street and i remember when i said to my wife i said let me tell you something god just spoke to me we will either have this unit or one of these six in here but we will not be moving from here where my testimony is that very unit that they said that i couldn't get and was impossible for me to buy is mine still is mine and not only that we bought it without any money we had no money we prayed we walked into the today to the agent the real estate agent she never saw us in her life and she picked up her phone and opponent manager and said i have two very good friends here a bank manager you know about that i didn't have money in we often said because workers and she said to him i have two very good friends here and they need fifteen thousand dollars to pay them on the unit i'm sorry but that happened and then i didn't have any money to close the deal or do anything and god kept that place as is for 10 years the lawyers kept asking themselves they kept saying to me we don't understand why we cannot finish this thing and you pay your money and close this deal it was because i had no money it stayed as it was until i had changed jobs and had enough money to close the deal and to pay for the unit properly so again he showed that he is god of the impossible because i bought that place without the stent in my hand there was another thing that happened with my son my last son gile one day he was running in the house he was two years old three years old and he hit her chair and his lips split in two and at that point i just told my wife only together and i got some uh salt butter and some an ice and i put it on it and i told up all day together and i went upstairs to the chain of clothes while i was changing my clothes a very short prayer i said a very short descriptor i said lord you know i don't want this child all stitched up and i would really want you to heal this quickly and that was all i said just hear this and i put on my clothes i called sinclair medical and i told them that i was bringing a child in and i wanted them i didn't want any stitching i wanted them to use a particular type of plaster that would hold it together i asked them how much it would cost they said 200. in those days you know money was in short supply in my life so i had to go to the bank make sure i just had about two hundred dollars took it all and all i was telling my wife is keep squeezing that lip i didn't know why i was saying that just keep spinning don't let it cook and she had him in her arms and he went to sync america they took him in about 10 minutes later the doctor came out he said um i said so what's the situation i said using the plaster he said there's nothing nothing to i can't do anything i said what do you mean you can't do anything and he said the words again well there's nothing i can possibly do it's not possible so i heard the words again not possible and in my mind i said it means that this child will have to stay with us and let the split in two for the rest of his life and i said what do you mean so i'll come and see so i'm i'm walking expected to see the lip split in two because he said it's not possible for him to do anything and when he what he did was showed me is i did a public level he showed me that it was actually healed already so there was nothing for him to do that's why they said it's not possible for me to do anything was completely healed he told me to use a little glycerine on it which i never really did and um after this day he doesn't even have a scar in that place so that was healing half an hour between home and the hospital and then the last thing i want to leave with you is we know about you know we be good about when the prophet had to do something on that plane of the city i had an experience where i was supposed to go to a conference in martinique and i wasn't the most senior officer so you know it was favorite a lot of people would see next to me were very upset that i was chosen and i had a country i heard a car and there was a guy who said driving the car was supposed to pick me up to come to the airport the flight of the fight it was ten o'clock i knew that they would close all flights maybe on that one before so he was supposed to pick memphis eight o'clock came nine o'clock came quarter to turn him and then the skies got very dark and there was a like a whole storm that was going on in tom where he was supposed to pick me up he picked me up at maybe five to ten that flight was supposed to be about 10. so when he came to pick me up i was so destroyed i said what sense does it make no so he kept insisting no let's go let's not say i said dave the flight leaves at ten o'clock it is five to ten that flight is closed so there's no way i said look at this sweater and he picked up my suitcase and he put it in the car so i followed him so we're driving up the road flood water all over the road we had to actually swim through some of the water with a car even the banks had overflowed by the golden growth prison because we came off the bus and came through there and i'm saying by what sense does this make but for some reason he was insisting and i was good so we're walking the only airport and he takes it to this and he goes ahead and i'm following him in my mind what i'm saying is what am i going to tell my boss about why i did not get on that flight to my conference that everybody else felt i shouldn't go to when i was so you could you know how dumb i was feeling and as he was walking to the count i looked at the content i saw two of the people who would book you and they were still on the counter which was strange so i walked to the compton and i said i am supposed to be on the flight tomorrow you're gonna say okay do you have your passport in the ticket and i said the flight is still here and the lady said yes the flight has been delayed nobody could nobody could could um believe you know or or experience what i went through at that point in time i mean it was like impossible that flight was still there so i said how come i mean i was actually talking about i said how could they fly she said well there was some problem and there was a delay and so let me tell you something that's why it was indeed i got on the flight when we got on the flight there was some little issue and there was some spoke coming from something i was not dismayed at all because i knew the same god who kept that fight for me would keep me all the way to my so i just wanted to read with you that all the black skies that i had and the flood water that i had to get to that airport all this disappointment all the different negatives that you know is not possible this can't happen god is god of the impossible god is still god and no matter what they see his word is what he is faithful to and we must remember who we are and the privileges and the authority we have and the promises we have and all we have to do is claim them because even when our faith is no god is still working on the other side so god bless you states i hope this encourages somebody it might be in a situation that you think it's impossible but remember he is god of the impossible god bless you oh praise the lord how many appreciate that testimony we certainly appreciate mr june redhead and by the black man for that testimony we are appreciated on the show of faith lifting and encouraging oh blessed be then we're going to give you a lot of praise tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god and now we have a brother from the usa um brother brother kelly salt and um i believe we met in 2014. brother kelly um uh i know you all don't know him i've met him he has been connected to us have debris since that time and at this time i want him to share his testimony with you and i know it will be a blessing god bless you brother kelly thank the lord god bless you can you hear me a while yes god bless you well first of all it's a great privilege to be able to testify tonight uh with a black man i'm another miracle of impossibility standing in front of you today my wife and i live in the northern part of the state of indiana my wife's side of she's in the other room listening and um i am here because i really want to let everyone know that this gospel is real i didn't know it last year although i've been in the message for more than 30 years but it's real so um it's kind of hard to go back but maybe i'll just give you a little bit of my background in the long journey i feel that moses it took the lord 40 years almost to beat it out beat me to a certain place where he could get me where he wanted me so um just as a background um my family as a little boy we were in the southern states i was born down there and they were church of christ which was funny to me now because that was brother branham said that was his argent arkan arc enemy was the church of christ but that's what my family was but um i had a good bible upbringing with my mother making sure we knew the word especially could um there was a point where things happen in our family as often does and my family split and we moved up north when i was about nine up here in indiana and um went out like everyone born in sin and shape and iniquity i come into this world speaking lies and in the world like any other kid i was a musician i played rock guitar i went out with the guys i did about everything that you can think of that a teenager would do got into a lot of things that i regret today even but in the midst of all that there was always somewhere no hunger for god behind all that sin so one day i was about 17. and uh i was with a friend who's older me about five or six years older uh in his apartment and we were talking and turns out he was a backslidden christian and he told me about a church he had attended now the church of christ where we had come out of we were no longer attending the church of christ they believe in regeneration or a new birth by baptism so basically i had in my head well i'm going to live the way i want to live until a certain point and then i'll get baptized a little fire insurance you know i'm gonna make it and that's the way you believed and it was just thing that you you know you lived a good life you got baptized and you were saved and um i've it's it was really pretty easy compared to even the catholics just get baptized here done so i thought uh he was telling me though this friend about this church he was in and for me it's like you get baptized you live a good life and you go to heaven and in this church he had backslid from he told me about how the presence of god would come down in that church and the anointing and so many different supernatural things that happen and uh you know at the time we were drinking wine and he's telling me about god and so but something struck me and i was like you mean you can know god while you're still on the earth and it struck me really hit me hard and of course i went back out in the world but that stuck with me that there was a way to know god while i'm still here on the earth it was totally new so um back in the world then somewhere in december 1983 i found he was going to a church and locally here so we started going to church together and at that time there were a lot of charismatic groups charismatic catholics charismatic mennonites suddenly the tongues and speaking in tongues and all that was a big thing and so i was really really hungry because um i was in church and i thought you were supposed to be able to just stop all the stuff you were doing that you had been doing in the world and just suddenly you're good and you go to church because that was what we were raised you'd be good you go to church you go to heaven i could not stop i could not stop the unclean habits the unholy desires i could not stop it and i'm a young man you know 21 22 years old and you know suddenly i'm in the light of god's word and i'm finding myself a sinner and so you know there was no no one to tell a young man what to do you know so but i was still hungry so kept going um i found out there was a church a remnant of the church you told me about meeting down near fort wayne indiana which is about hours south of here and i started going down there and still hungering for god i had some supernatural experiences and things i had some dreams i had but none of that changed me and i was still struggling with my past so that that group that was down there fort wayne decided that they were going to look for a place to baptize now they baptized three times forward father son holy ghost that was the way they baptized so they wanted a place to baptize so they went to a place halfway between here in fort wayne called kendeville to a man's house he lived on a small lake he had a house on the lake and they were looking around there and his name was brother maurice mark court and so they talking to him somehow they decided to have a bible study on tuesday nights which here we are having bible studies on tuesday nights but we had bible studies on tuesday nights and it was halfway for me and halfway for the little house it was a little house church and brother marcourt they met at his house and the pastor the little church house group that we had began the bible study and he asked brother mark court a question and we were studying the book of daniel and brother mark court took the statue of nebuchadnezzar in his dream and went all the way from never connected his time all the way down to our time and explained the whole saying and you know uh spoke about daniel it was such an experience i've never heard anything like in my life uh obviously as you guessed he was quoting the prophet but i didn't know and um i literally felt like falling on my face on his living room floor it was so incredible i drove home that night and in the dark stunned and i said what is this i've never heard anything like this before so we started meeting his house every week for about a year and they the people i was with the pastor would say something and turn it over to brother marquardt they just wanted him to talk and he would expound on the message talking about brother branham and it turns out he he was not in the message per se he was in this a retired assembly of god preacher he'd been one for 30 years but he had as when he was first saved he and his wife sister mary helen had an opportunity to be in brother branno's meetings in probably the early 50s in fort wayne indiana and brother mark court and sister mary helen were there when the little boy jumped out of brother branham's arms you know the crippled boy uh the ladies i believe it was a midnight lady threw her hands up in the air and the piano kept playing and you know they were there and uh they um saw some of those things sister mary helen told me that there was a time he was casting a devil out of an epileptic boy and he asked everyone to bow their heads and she said a lady did not in the audience and that devil went from the boy to that woman in the audience and sister mary helen told me she said that woman went down between the seats screaming as he said we went out to pray for her but there was nothing we could do so they had seen all these things and the lord even told brother mark court you know and this obviously this is before they were in the ministry they were just young christians and the lord and brother mark went and prayed way back he had a place in the warehouse he worked out where he prayed and he said lord what is this and so anyway he told me is malachi 4 5 6. but strangely enough brother marcourt though he was in further meetings didn't really have an understanding it wasn't until the 1980s after he was retired he was in the pentecostal church a trinitarian church with a revelation of the deity of jesus christ baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ so he was an unusual man so anyway he began in our bible studies then to talk about the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and uh i saw the truth of it and more than that i wanted the baptism of the holy ghost really bad and that's the first time i've been with the charismatic groups and all that and you know i spoke in tongues i had i had a real experience with interpretations it did not change me and so here i saw a promise if i repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ i would receive the holy ghost and i tell you i dove in there quick so fast forward so after i was baptized then the bible study just although the people used to still come out with all his testimonies still come out to his house and baptize a trinitarian um so anyway i was looking for a church then after that because obviously i couldn't go back to where they were at i had with brother branham i just was it was totally different i did struggle some about whether or not this was true because they had little books you know the little messages and my stepfather was jehovah's witness well they had little books too like the watchtower and the weight magazine so i was like what are these little books they have so i was struggling a little bit but he gave me church ages seven seals and footsteps you know uh in in the in the sands of time and um i read that and i read in there where brother brown was 14 and he got shot through the legs by a friend was in the hospital dying and bleeding and had a vision that he had went down to the regions of the dam damned and he was falling down down down and he was saying i was reaching out and i was calling for my dad and he was not there and i was trying to catch myself and i was tumbling and tumbling and he was talking like this and i read this in there and i went home at that time i had moved back in with my parents because i was kind of going through a rough time and turned on the abc the evening news there was a young man at the last story they had in boston a young man there with his father he had aids and the young man said i keep having this dream that i'm falling and i'm falling and falling and i'm calling for my father and he's not there word for word but brother banham said and so you know again it was a major it was amazing so anyway the other i left the other church and i asked brother mark where i should go he said well there's a church in fort wayne so he went down i went to the church and that was um there was brother tommy dillard brought over and walked into there and you know i felt like brother clarence you know last week when we had the first testimony he said these people are like angels and i you know i was like whoa you know and so ah you know everybody's talking about the lord and and you know there had that was 1987 in the fall uh in the summer i think it started and um there had been uh an outpouring in 1983 and there was still a lot of talk about it and i was like wow this is for me because you know this is what i was wanting you know and um time went on and i was i was eating the messages up i'll try to hurry here they um um well went through a lot of things there there was a lot of things i was asking people about how did you receive the holy ghost did you receive the holy ghost and uh i said it were you sealed and then one brother is like well somebody gave me a tape for brother branham's life story and when he cried i cried and that was his you know i got all kinds of stories like that about the baptism of the holy ghost you know my brother said he fell asleep he woke up and he was different i don't know so i'm still looking and searching um my wife and i that i met her through that church and we were married in 1991. so my friends i had a lot of spiritual experiences i had been to the conventions i saw brother ovid there the first time there were times when we had worship and worship services and you felt like you were on cloud nine and i felt thought sometimes i never knew heaven could be so great down here on earth and then walk out go back home in a couple of days i'm myself again the same problems the same issues the same chains i had chains on me so going quickly forward then we came we um went to some different churches and whatnot um all within the seven thunders and in the end um the church in fort wayne dissolved so we hooked into new york city in 2002 i think 2003 somewhere in there and so um you all know that there were some rough times in there during those last 10 years and so that that last bit when as brother overcalled it the jw virus was there and the writing on the wall and uh it was and i was still there with so much condemnation coming out at that point i you could almost cut it with a knife it was so thick and so heavy and i was already feeling like i'm never worthy and then all that came and it just beat me down real bad but i didn't know where to go because you know we were just kind of like those people knew what they were talking about all those years and i looking back i as soon as i walked into fort wayne church way back looking back now i started following men that was when i walked into fort wayne church that was where i started following men and that was the big mistake so i followed them right off the cliff and and that whole thing at the end of the new york church before it dissolved into pieces killed my family my youngest two really were really hurt my young son was furious at me he was a teenager why did you not stop going and so we really had a rough time about that time brother overcame and preached at new york after brother coleman passed and he was saying something about i think you'd open a radiator or something and got burned and you were saying you know that wasn't satan it was me i messed up and it inspired me i said wow that's really humble he said him i never heard a minister say he messed up so i i excuse me i gotta my timer went off uh-oh all right so i'm out of time but either way i took that and um i took those words from brother over and i went and spoke to my son and he asked he was mad and he said why did you stay in that church and i said i'm messed up i messed up bad and those words saved my relationship with my son so fast forward again brother over came in 2014 to pennsylvania and i was destroyed by then i pretty much quit i had failed as a christian i had failed my family i'd failed everything and he came in 2014 and i don't remember a whole lot i'm sorry but i do remember your piece the plumb line you know holding it to the plummet and that was like the anchor that set something in the ground that i could hold on to because i was like yeah that's right that's right it never the lord never changes ever i can hold on to that so then we saw you again in 2016 in kentucky we uh began watching services on 2013 and uh to be honest i had no desire to watch anything but sunday i didn't worship i didn't read my bible i didn't pray i was a mess and my dear wife was praying she prayed a lot bless her heart and um and those same things i struggled with that 14 17 19 unholy thoughts unholy all kinds of things they were still there after all these years after anointings after everything so i think if i'll i'll cut it off here and if i maybe just read brother over the testimony that i wrote to you and basically i explained to brother of it that uh it's that um he called us and invited us to a bible study on september 7th of last year so anyway i had told him i said i'd like to know for the last 10 years starting with the events that eventually led to the dissolution in new york church i've been very low much due to the devastating effects those events had on myself and my family and i explained to him how bad it was and i said i could not worship i couldn't hardly utter a prayer other than a wild cry not to die that way so when you called us this past september 7th we were on our way back from my sister my daughter lily's house in ohio and brother ovin rang my phone invited us to a bible study september 7th never forget her brother never and i he said he invited us to a bible study the next night and i was literally sitting there going why is that you hear and die and i accepted his invitation a very gracious invitation so the first bible study the next night was why is that here why said you hear and die brother isaac and of course i knew the lord enough despite i never i always believed the lord never changed it was me i never could blame him for anything to happen it was all me so i knew that was the lord he had for me so i wrote there um that something at that point from that first bible study began to turn around with each prayer meeting and bible study i began to gain strength the glimpse we were given into god's nature as a prophetic being calling those things that are not as so they were begin to open something up and i began to see how it applied to me and the promises god gave to us to live in this age because i knew all the promises you know that's one good thing i had a lot of words so at one time brother ovid was exhorting us and he said that god is mysterious he said he didn't just decide to become mysterious he is mysterious and at that point something struck me that the lord meant what he said i always thought different but he meant what he said when he said it was in mysterious and something turned and said well then that means he meant everything else he said so um anyway so anyway something broken me at that point i began to read the whole bible and message differently for the first time after more than three decades decades of trying to walk as a christian with a white knuckle grip trying to hang on trying to do right and still struggling i began to truly understand the gospel and to catch a vision of christ's blood shed for me so that could have bold and direct access to the throne of grace the effect of finally letting go of all my own efforts to be a christian and simply accepting god's provided sacrifice brought about results that i was not expecting albeit without any sensation or am i being aware of it at the time things that had me bound in chains all my life simply dropped away i don't even know when it happened they just left it's so completely gone that it's almost as if it never happened it's an odd feeling nor have i ever had an experience like that in my life so it was the preaching of the of the blood that did it brother ovid and if i may quickly it was the word made flesh was the message that really nailed it home for me you had said a number of things before that i was catching revelations about the blood and if i may humbly say friends it's i'm talking about ovid but it was the ministry of reconciliation the lord jesus himself talking to me through a ministry and i i'm that's what i feel for real so in the word made flesh he was talking about leaving the human humanistic realm he was quoting brother branham and beloved said that's when you're willing to let go of your past and to let go of your fears let go of your failures you just let go and let the spirit move in and that that hit heart i saw it i said i can do that and then the ending prayer he said father god i thank you this morning what you have given to me i have given to them father god may the word become flesh lord may thee invisibly become visible among them visit them with your revelation divine revelation bring them out of the humanistic lord may they not see their past their failures their shortcomings your blood has atoned for it all lord you have forgiven them you have cleansed them you have looked beyond their faults and saw what they had need of and father you come down the word may flesh to rescue us lord and deliver deliver us and redeem us father may be with them a special way and he closed out the prayer and so i took those words i went back to the tape wrote them all down and i took that and the one scripture was on my mind if we confess our sins first john 1 9 he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and i just wanted to be forgiven i just wanted to be able to pick up the pieces and walk forward i had no idea that the lord had brought me to a place where he fulfilled that last part cleanses from all unrighteousness i didn't know that that was real and things that used to bother me if i may say going into a store during the summer time people are dressed a certain way those things bothered me horribly i really struggled after what happened to me at the end of last year is when this happened no problem those devils have no breach i feel sincerely like i'm walking encapsulated in bulletproof glass i feel them think on the glass but they cannot reach me anymore and the whole everything has changed um everything has changed the message the bible everything is brand new for me so i really didn't know what happened but i did know i was thinking one day i don't know what this is i don't know what happened but i do know that i had the evidence of any things unseen something real has happened so anyway god bless you all i am on my way to glory i have i am totally changed totally changed it took an awful long time but i am so glad and every day i i just look in astonishment at where i'm at now where i only dream to be for all those years i don't dream to be a christian i dream to be able to testify like this so god bless you thank you for being patient and uh i'm i want to encourage all that this it truly is real i never knew it was i heard the gospels years and years but it became real to me and it manifested itself in my life god bless you and thank you amen god bless you thank you so much uh brother kelly uh god bless you and um how many are blessed tonight you appreciate the service tonight uh what a time in the presence of the lord tonight i really want to thank brother kelly south brother michael blackman sister june redhead for sharing uh so much about what the lord has not only done for you and through you but also sharing of yourselves you know we are we are family you know and it's it's such a touching moment to see that the the reality of god working through situations to prove himself that we could truly learn to trust him and it's a process of learning the same way jesus had to learn obedience through the things that he suffered so hearing and seeing the feet you know i was saying to my wife as the service is progressing this is so faith-building because it is is it's it's it's each one encouraging one another you know so my heart is blessed and there's such an anointing that i feel coming off of this service because this is what god loves he loves when we talk about him he loves when we fellowship around him and god loves when we become his advertisement board that's that's a phrase with a branham used that through each of us we have a testimony we have valleys we have mountains but as with the blackburn said everything he has achieved everything that has happened in his life every positive thing can look at he could see that it's god and it's the same thing but the kelly is saying it's the same things it's a junior saying it's the same thing that was said in the last meeting that we had uh when brother clarence spoke and when sister donna spoke and brother andy spoke and and each of us can look at moments in our lives even sometimes when we don't realize it and you and you're hearing each one saying at the time i didn't even realize that it was god at the time i didn't realize what i was learning at the time i didn't realize what god was taking me to but when i look back i realized he was holding me you know that that when i thought i was one set of footprints it was really god carrying me so i'm really blessed tonight and i trust that this is such an encouragement to us to keep holding on to keep pressing forward your change is going to come your blessing is going to come the promise and the promises that we have been holding on for all of these years is going to come to pass because god is going to confirm his word i really want to pray now not and before we pray to close that i want to pray for those who are on this call tonight there are so many different situations in in in this room and there's so much about so many of us that that we may never know unless somebody shares it you know so i know i'm encouraged and i know that given the opportunity there'll be something that that you would say that would encourage someone but i want to just encourage you in prayer tonight before we close out so can we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for your presence for your grace for your love for your mercy lord we don't have the words to thank you lord we have listened to lord testimonies being shared of how you have ministered lord to each one who spoke tonight lord in different situations and this is so precious to me because i believe in a god of a reality that we have to be able to have a practical application of this thing that you are as interested in our everyday life as you are interested in us understanding and knowing your word and knowing you personally lord that is how you want you want to be lord in such a relationship with us as sister june said lord lord we acknowledge you in everything we acknowledge you in a job application we acknowledge you go into work in the morning lord even when we don't see you we acknowledge you father lord
