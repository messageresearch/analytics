have your Bibles we'll just take it real quickly uh to a few portion of scriptures that we have tonight amen so we thank God for his love and we see the end of the air finally coming to its closing chapters and so we know that it has has been his grace and mercy amen that has brought us this far so we certainly thankful to God Amen praise God and um so this last Wednesday night service of the year and just praying that we God out with a shout amen tonight so I have a thought here and it's these scriptures now that we'll read as we get a context for it Joel chapter 2 uh we also want to read from Isaiah chapter 40 and last lastly our scripture for this evening would be Ephesians 6 okay um now I was inclined to read the whole scripture here in Joel because um I was inspired by the Joel Army scripture here how he talks about in Joel 2 and um I know it's a lengthy scripture so we'll try to get through it um we'll just see how it goes amen so we just have it as Joel 2 and we'll just read through all right so from verse one it says blow ye the trumpet in Zion sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is nigh at hand a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains or great great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall there be anymore after it even to the years of many generations a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the Garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape them the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as Horsemen so shall they run like the noise of Chariots on the tops of mountain shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble and as a strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pained all faces Shall Gather Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March everyone on his ways they shall not break their ranks neither shall one trust one another they shall walk everyone in his path and in other words everyone in their place amen not Crossing each other's path praise God but knowing amen the the the road that they set upon amen and they when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb upon the houses they shall enter into the Windows like a thief the Earth shall Quake before them the heaven shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark and the Stars shall withdraw their Shining and the Lord will utter his voice before his army Hallelujah for his captain is very great and for he is strong that executed his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it therefore also now sayth the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart oh what an inspiring scripture tonight amen and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and ren your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of evil oh Hallelujah let's skip down to uh uh uh verse uh 20 uh 21 amen he said fear not Oh Land be BL uh be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things 22 he said Be not Afraid beast of the field for the PES of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth of fruit for the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten and the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I send among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your God that had dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed oh Hallelujah they believe it tonight and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and verse 28 he said now it come to pass afterward that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions amen we'll stop there for tonight amen praise God Isaiah 40 amen amen amen praise God uh just a few verses in here uh Isaiah 4030 and 31 just down to the End Amen Isaiah 40:30 it says even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint amen and our final scripture tonight amen is from Ephesians amen praise God uh Ephesians 6 final scripture if you Ephesians 6: 10 right familiar scripture here says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins CT about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith he shall be able to quench all the fiery DTS of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen let's bow our heads one more time as we pray amen Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word that we've read tonight Lord such an inspiring scripture we pray that your holy spirit will come upon it Lord and breathe your own life into it Lord for any man can read the scripture father but it would take you to come and Quicken it bring it to life and make it real for us Lord that we could see

there oh Hallelujah and that's what we want to talk about tonight by the grace of God Amen praise God hallelujah so let me read the quote for context amen the prophet says we find out that he gets killed with the sword too the the sword which is a word he said God's word sharp to sword he says it slays him slays who slays the devil oh if you have the sword tonight you can slay the devil oh with every promise that he spoke you can slay the devil tonight oh God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God is a restorer chopping the devil away it takes faith in the word of God it takes a Str strong hand of Faith to pick up the sword and challenge the enemy on any ground he comes upon oh I'll God give you a faith tonight to stand in defiance against the enemy of this world against Satan of this world against a Satan in this message that have deceived the people oh Hallelujah taken the faith away from them oh Hallelujah but God Jesus prayed for you that your faith should fail not oh that your faith should rest in the unfailing body word oh hallelujah hallelujah stand and fight the battle tonight oh Hallelujah God's looking for that group tonight are you going to be in it are you going to be in

that group tonight that group that can take the word and hand it there it'll slice it'll cut oh let me read it here my God getting ahead of myself the word to edged sword slays him puts him right down he said wait till them seven tunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word and hand it there it'll slice and cut he says they can close the heavens that is not skin milk oh that is a church on fire that is a church with the power of God in it sign one is Miracles he said they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to Glory says he'll be slain by the word that proceeds from his mouth oh Hallelujah sharper than a two-edged sword oh Hallelujah he said they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen he said whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God yeah amen he says oh so the bride is going to be God's mouth peace oh and the voice of the Archangel is going to be veil in you to speak the word of God and it'll flash like lightning oh Hallelujah that's what's fixing to take place this is do you believe it that's what's fixing to take place now and the devil's trying to get you away from it praise God cuz if you only if you only come into what you're going to become he's finished tonight oh but he was finished 6,000 years ago oh when Jesus laid his Ser on the cross oh Hallelujah and he died and he shed his blood oh Hallelujah that blood paid the price for you and me to come into this Redemption back to a former State oh Hallelujah being restored back to sunship oh where the church will find his place oh Hallelujah gift will find his place oh where the holy spirit is move freely oh one over there one over there I can place him Place her the adoption amen that's what we've been fighting to forwards all these years amen amen God's proud God's looking for a graduation day where he can put a Rob and a ring upon his sons who have crossed Jordan and come through tests and come through trials and come through persecutions and come through hell oh who have faced the enemy head on and said though he slay me yet will I trust him you went through trials things almost broke your heart things almost broke your bank oh Hallelujah things almost broke your trust but you never lost your praise your praise is still here I still have something to say to God and it is Thanksgiving it is praise and glory and worship because if without him I would be nothing tonight without him I would never have made it without him I'd never be able to overcome without him I'd have never known how to forgive how to love how to be like Christ to my brother how to be like Christ to my sister it takes God to do that it takes God to take you to the steam press of H trials and H testings oh all the things you go through God allow people to turn their back on you God allow people to turn away from you and to look the other direction and to scorn you and to spurn you so that God in you will be raised up so that the god in you oh it begin to come forth when you die to yourself when you die to your stinking flesh oh Hallelujah and you come to the Perfection hallelujah oh hallelujah it's a rough road oh people talk about adoption and power and Glory but there's trials and testings in there Prophet talk about laying on my hospital bed take their wife away take the son away take the daughter away from them what you going to do you still want to be a Christian you still going to stand stand for the truth are you going to back down are you a whimp are you a jellyfish something inside your soul has got to rise up oh holl claim your inheritance and stay with that word sir somebody say Amen yes sir Glory hallelujah amen hallelujah in every age so there's been a group every age that's been called out to respond to the word of God for that age do you believe that tonight Ephesians 10 says for whosoever this is sorry Romans 10:13 says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved who then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed or how shall they believe in him of uh of whom they have not heard Hallelujah and how shall they hear without a preacher so he's tracing it back now he said in order for you to be safe God had to put all these processes in place in order for you to be that group that can hear the word God had to make a way for the word of God to come to you oh to the foolishness of preaching to what seem heretical to the world to a way called heresy God made a way to get you wherever you was laying in the Baptist Church laying in the Methodist Church laying in the Catholic church or wherever you was out in the world doing whatever you were doing God had to find a way to get his word to you so that it could change your life so that it could affect you oh spiritually speaking hallelujah oh Hallelujah isn't that right faith faith is not belief there's actually a difference just learned that recently you believe your own human beliefs you can say I believe in something I I think this is right or I believe in it it enough to give life to it isn't that right amen you can do that in your mental praise God but faith is not logical faith has no reasoning behind it there's no reason why it doesn't make sense but something went past your flesh something went past your human Spirit something went down in the circuit of your heart oh Hallelujah and you believe because you got in contact with something that you know what greater than you oh your mind couldn't conceive oh but there something happening on the inside inside inside your heart inside your soul some change begin to take place it's not rational it's not reasonable it's not logical it's Faith amen and the just shall live by faith oh and not by sight amen hallelujah hallelujah my glory it's not reasonable praise God Amen us to come all this way people say where you go to church in Grand gosh you could not go to a church around the corner you can not go somewhere right there I mean it make it easy for you you could just walk to church could have a church here look at have a church there why you choose to come here why you choose to believe the way you do why you choose to praise God in spite of trials in your life why you choose to come all this way why you choose to get up in the morning why you choose to put on your clothes why you choose to come into the house of God it's because something on the inside the devil didn't put it there and the devil can't take it away it might not be rational to drive all the way to sangri Grande but there's something in your soul something in your heart that's crying out for life and you've got to find it crying out for the true word of God crying out hallelujah oh and that's a thirst that God put in every man oh Hallelujah and man every man woman and child he put a thirst in you for reality oh for something real tonight amen amen you've got to believe you got it amen amen cuz there's many praise God who don't have it amen it's not for everybody it's for them that believe amen amen hallelujah all right so praise God Amen all right where where are we reach now okay how say part they preaching let they be sent right Romans 10 and as written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they that have not all obeyed the gospel here's Paul saying it for Isaiah said Lord who had believed our report so then he said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that's it right there amen do you believe it amen so the prophet says on this four quote that we read that group right has the ability to do two things one take the word and two hand it there oh Hallelujah so what does take mean take means to receive isn't that right you got to be able to take it you got to be able to receive it you got to be able to receive it inwardly and openly you've got to know that it's for you something has got to register inside your soul inside your heart that that what that man is saying or whatever is being said is for me oh as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I'm here to take the word take the word and die take the word and die to reasoning take the word and tie to your intellect tie to your feelings tie to your flesh tie to what's going on around you tie to your environment tie to everything that's going on and hold on to that word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh that group that God is calling out tonight that group that God has predestinated to stand in this age to stand on Malachi 4's word oh Hallelujah that group tonight oh it's got to be able to take that word oh Hallelujah can you take the word tonight that's what's been going on in this message that's what's been going on since a prophet came it's been a great word test oh Hallelujah isn't that right can you stay with that word and we see throughout all the years many have fallen away many have fallen Away by Creeds by Dogers by interpretations by intellect many are Falling Away by their feelings Falling Away by their ideas Falling Away by how they think their things as supposed to be there's a way that seem it right unto a man but the end thereof is death you cannot walk according to your feelings the Bible does not exonerate anybody who walks according to feelings you've got to walk according to your faith oh somebody say Amen oh hallelujah what God put inside of you not even your human reasoning not even your human beliefs or what you perceive as value no no no it's a spiritual Faith that's got to come into you and say I believe believe oh Hallelujah thou artart the Jesus Son of the Living God Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God that's not human belief that's divine revelation strikes your soul and reveals a written word and shows you amen who is that up there who is that speaking to you who is that anointing you what is that you're feeling amen oh Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh my that's a reality amen and that's the reality we walk in tonight isn't that right oh my you receive the word you receive God in your heart and the devil cannot make you denied praise isn't that right the devil amen the Gates of Hell will stand but they cannot Prevail against Revelation oh because Revelation is prevailing power oh do you believe it amen praise God Amen GL sometimes I was looking at optical illusions it's a very interesting thing I don't know if you ever seen one praise God but there are optical illusions there are things that are drawn or created in a certain way that makes it look like you're seeing something you're not seeing praise God isn't that right sometimes you draw lines wavy like this and when you look at it long enough it look like the Lin's jumping but the lines are standing still but it's something your eyes is doing it's trying to adjust and settle on the picture that it is seeing and all these things are really to prove that what you sometimes what you think you're seeing you're not really seeing what you think you looking at you not really looking at your vision is is is is kind of cheated because because a natural vision is just your two eyes God give you praise God to be here on Earth and the older you get is the stronger your glasses will have to get because your eyes begin to fail you after a while praise God and you won't see as much as you were able to see 10 or 20 years ago praise God things are fading things of this world will fade away but we know something that will never pass away and that is the word of God hallelujah he you can't trust your natural eyes if you can't even trust your natural eyes oh Hallelujah to see then what are you really seeing oh how people see a lot of things people look for a lot of things according to the fashion of their own thoughts or fashion of their own minds but we need a people tonight that are willing to walk by faith that are willing to walk according to the word of God that are willing to take that word oh Hal and stand by it and stand upon it and believe it Hallelujah we regardless of the Dark Skies the dark skies are not a sign of God's disapproval and the bright skies are not a sign of his acceptance his acceptance is you and the Beloved oh his acceptance is when he pours the holy ghost into you and baptize you with fire that's his acceptance not some human intellect not shaking hands and joining church not a certificate not a business card but the fire of God has got to come into your heart and Bur burn the demons out burn the lust out burn the lies out burn the filth out and put God in a man and then you'll see the difference oh Hallelujah and until that happens then we need that group to step forward amen oh and claim their inheritance amen amen do you believe it tonight Hallelujah GL we need that group to step forward yes sir Hallelujah we live in an age now I I believe there's a cry for leadership there's a cry for leadership there's too much Madness going around there too much craziness it's too much of Flesh running around too much man running around with their own ideas of things with their own their own interpretation of life and how they think others should live and by that interpretation it dictates their decision making and it dictates the environment that they create for others Hallelujah and in most cases it's toxic because it's driven by lust of men lust for power lust for big things lust for money Lust For popularity all these things are supposed to be dead to the believer the prophet said so but it's very much alive today in the world you go out in the business World education World politics wherever it's corrupt it's ungodly pray we need leaders to step forward we need God made man we need God made women to step out of the pages of the Bible and live something on this world that'll make a difference when you walk it'll make a difference when you speak it'll make a difference when you go to work when you have conversations the rainbow of God to be flashing out of you displaying his love displaying his Beauty displaying his kindness displaying his forgiveness all these wonderful qualities of the pyramid life is what we are striving for tonight to be positionally placed to have these things in us so that we could mean something huh it'll make the difference in year and the more dark the world gets the more corrupt the world gets the more evil the world gets the more we ought to strive towards this and when this begins to shine in on us it'll be the contrast between light and darkness cuz as the world gets darker and more into their Folly and more into their foolishness we become brighter in the scatness of his glory we become shining in His image the image as of the only begotten of the father full of grace full of Truth oh can we say Amen tonight you are called to glory and to Virtue amen amen don't you forget it tonight amen so we got to do two things take the word so we are not taking the word right taking also means take up like to take up a Authority isn't that right but God's not going to hand authority to you until you have the character to take it until you're fit to take it isn't that right yes sir brother bam said God cannot send a Revival until he's got man in shape to pack that Revival until he's got man in shape to take that word and die to themselves take that word and deny their own ability take that word and deny their own lust and deny their own selves and deny what they want and what they think and die to themelves upon the cross and say God change me Lord make me more Christian make me more like you the prophet said make fit servants make better servants oh Hallelujah isn't that right we can come into His Image and his likeness oh Hallelujah but many are not asking for that a lot of people are caught up in themselves caught up in their flesh ACC on what they think and unfortunately it falls upon the leaders is is that right Hallelujah isn't that right and as the leaders do so does the environment that they create isn't not right but said a startling thing I think one of the Friday prayer meetings also we had uh uh I believe yeah to that same to that same to that same air to that same word that we need we need leaders to rise up and to claim what God is what God wants to do in this last day to live something to be like Christ before the people amen amen isn't that right okay I'm going on let's see so the devil all right so that comes by Revelation watch knowing how to correctly place that word that's what it means to take okay oh sorry hand it there so it's two things right take and hand it there you take it up pick up the word for your day your hour your season isn't that right you recognize your day and your message and handing the day is about that Authority isn't that right knowing how to correctly place that word amen isn't that right Prophet said out all the gifts so out there praise God healing delivering isn't that right one of the greatest gift is to be able to rightly divide the word isn't that right rightly divide it and that comes by Revelation and by testing training knowing what God wants to do with the word isn't that right isn't that right and that bride she'll know what God wants to do with the word the prophet said she does it in his name isn't that right she will have thus say the Lord or she will keep still oh that's who that bride is she's got all his potentials oh to be M Jesus Christ oh and she

doubted it oh H we need more marries tonight amen more Maries I would stand with the gospel more marries that would step forward in faith despite the odds oh Hallelujah H every time Christmas time comes around I always think about Mary and the story of Mary and Joseph and how they brought forth Jesus oh it was a rugged time oh hallelujah praise God it was a tough time oh Mary had her own situations going on she was espoused to Joseph they were supposed to get married all all things are supposed to take place and all of a sudden God come down in the middle of that situation and he brought something else Hallelujah it wasn't in their mind it wasn't anything they wanted but it was what God wanted for the time and the season God is ready to bring forth his son and God had a vessel that was chosen and that was ready oh Mary could have denied it Mary could have said listen angel I I appreciate your sermon I appreciate you preaching but I have a whole life going on I'm about to get married I'm about to have a house and a car I'm about to get promoted I don't need this right now but something in Mary oh went beyond her n natural when Beyond her rational reasoning oh something

always have some better thought or some better idea of how things are supposed to go and it has nothing to do with you the program of God has nothing to do with you has nothing to do with us has nothing to do with what we want or what we desire it is what God wants isn't that right when Jesus was walking through the five pools huh and he said uh I do nothing else the father show me isn't that right he went past all the lame and the Halt and the Blind and a sick and healed one man pra isn't that right who was there at to pool 38 years who knew that praise God who knew that story it had no

thank God for there's something to worship him for there's something to praise him for there's something to give God glory for I don't care what the solution is I don't care what the opposition is there's something tonight to praise God for I'll praise him with my whole heart in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation I will praise him tonight somebody lift your hands somebody open your mouth somebody going to praise God tonight you begin to thank him for Every Mountain for every Valley for every trial that he brought you through he deserves all the praise on Glory Glory hallu he don't deserve your complaints he deserves your praise don't be like them in the wilderness that complained and murmured Hallelujah those things for for our edification yes sir those things for our learning that we could see the difference compare the difference in scripture with the attitudes of the people of God that he dealt with throughout the ages Caleb said I'm just as strong as I was when I first started out oh Hallelujah isn't that right 80 something year old man ready for battle Ready for War what is that that's faith and the just shall live by faith not by sight Kayla wasn't looking at his joints and his old bones he was looking at the promise he was looking at what God told him he would have he come all this way not to drink soup praise God hallelujah and make cakes in the desert no no no no I come for my inheritance I come from my Mount Hebron give me my inheritance and I'll be well able to take it and that's how I feel tonight oh Hallelujah I feel like going home I feel like stomping on Devils I feel like praising God I feel like worshiping tonight despite of how I feel despite of what's going on in my body despite of what's going on in my family I feel like walking upon Jericho's walls tonight I feel like walking around my promise I feel like getting acquainted with my property I want to build a house there build a pool over there Hallelujah get acquainted with the promise of God Walk around your Jericho tonight and tell them time is up on your deliverance time is up on your healing time is up on that devil isn't that right oh my Hallelujah going out with a shout huh you're going to say I'm crazy after see I they see this tape amen wonderful wonderful glory to God hallelujah amen brother Terence Glory oh wow Joseph look at it until his word come the word of the Lord tried him huh he had to take that word now he got a dream when he was how much ever years old real young guy older brothers and stuff 17 I think right yeah long time by the time he got into Egypt and the whole thing unfolded he was an adult years had passed you know but uh he received a Dream from the Lord that was a personal revelation to him amen nobody else they should have dreamed to was just Joseph and he was happy about it he was excited about it and on top of the fact that he was his father's favorite now God was showing things to him oh it couldn't get any worse for the Brethren it couldn't get any words for the brothers they got jealous isn't that right yes it's man of everything going for him amen he get Daddy Mercedes he get a piece of land he get coat with rainbow colors he get special ring special this special that prayer now your special dream oh it was just the the straw that broke the camels back Hallelujah they couldn't take it oh they were rough with anger isn't that right and when he come looking for them cuz uh the father sent for S him said go look for your brothers when he went out looking for them they they got so mad at him is you they sent to get to us to daddy boy you all people they sent to fetch us no couldn't take it anymore so they sold him away is not right we know the story now in that dream all of the grains of corn is not right bowed before the Grain in the center isn't not right and all the the Sheep sorry had had to circle around his sheath and they had bowed isn't that right all the stars had bowed he already it was already laid out in the tapestry of time what was supposed to take place um in the future amen but what he was going through that in that present moment did not look anything like the dream that he had seen isn't that right by the time he got to Piper's house he was an immigrant speaking another language in another place nobody knew him and his father couldn't speak for him either and couldn't say he was a favorite so he's supposed to be treated differently he had to work to earn his place isn't that right he had to do he had to work he had to slave just like everybody else he had to earn his keep oh hallelujah hallelujah praise that right but he had the right attitude he did the right thing and God blessed him for it oh H cuz even in the midst of that situation even though he was quite mad with his brothers I'm sure he hadn't gotten over it then took years for him to come to terms with what had happened to him the wounds were still fresh praise God when he was in Piper's house but somehow in the midst of all of that dread he found a way to have the right attitude and to do the right thing because he was trained a certain way brought up as a proper child in his father's house he knew how to work and how to help the others when he was finished with his work and when pter for saw it he was pleased give him a promotion say help them with this help them with that praise God fix this and if you know how to do that let me try a hand until all of a sudden praise God isn't that right he was doing things and getting through isn't that right is finding favor praise God Amen now he could have stayed there but that's not div Vision he could have stayed there and put his house it be fine he'd have a good job you know he could go to work and go to the market and you have a change in his pocket to get some things and put if I give him a little Chariot to drive every now and then if you need to make a run to the drugstore and everything's fine like he could stay there but that's not the vision that God have for him to be in so God had to cause some discomfort yes to get Joseph to run from that place of ease of Zion he had to cause something to happen amen is that he allowed Piper's wife to get some other thoughts concerning him we all know the story isn't that right and she and she wrongfully accused him and he ended up in prison isn't that right praise God hallelujah but even there Hallelujah God's favor his hand was still upon him oh I just admire how Joseph had the right attitude despite the situation that he ended up in he always maintained the right attitude praise God even though his word did not come that same word tried him at every point of his life it tried him here it tried him on the prison tried him in Po's house tried him on the street tried him praise God Amen and his conversations with others God had a destination for for Joseph and he himself didn't fully understand well isn't that right until one day isn't that right Butler and the baker you know the story they get the dreams and know he tells Baker well your time is up Butler well you going to be reinstated but here what when you reach back I'm so sure this dream's going to come to pass that when you get there let them know I am here remember me don't don't forget me now don't forget the guy who told you about your promotion remember me and as soon as the butler reach inside there and they give him back his keys and his apartment and his shoes and his f clothing he forgot Joseph isn't that right typical human beings oh he forgot all about he forget about prison he forget how long his bed was he forget how hard you see human beings we love to distance ourselves from pain as f as possible anything associated with pain we like to distance ourselves from it so as much as prison was distanced from the butler's mind Joseph along with the pain and everything he throw it in a box and fling it far and say leaving that behind I get back my job now fellas praise God isn't that right and poor Joseph and God allow all of that because he's trying Joseph he's trying Joseph by the word he give him Joseph could pray poured his complaint before the Lord as David said and said here I am in prison Lord this is not what you told me what is going on I'm sure there were many nights like that he spent many days like that isn't that right I think it was some years after that the Butler and the baker story was ended over praise God not right he was still in that prison pining away waiting nobody knows what for but only God and his eternal mind knows the destination he have for Joseph and he had to have a man trained to handle a level of power that he was about to place him into oh he had to have a man trained he had to have a man dried out seasoned out tested tried proven oh Hallelujah to handle this level of power you're going to give it take a humble man to get the position that Joseph had in in Pharaoh's in Pharaoh's Egypt takes a trained man you can't be flying off the handle you have to be able to handle power you have to have wisdom understanding you have to care for others looking out for others isn't that right on some have compassion forgiving others praying one for another always isn't that right take certain levels of attributes to be in the position that God wants you to be in tonight God has a destination for you but he takes you through the process of these things to bring out of the pain of your circumstance to bring out character to bring out something in you oh as you die out to yourself now you're becoming more like Christ now you begin to understand things begin to see things differently see things through his eyes not through our own praise God hallelujah I thank God that he allows us to see certain things isn't that right he allows us to he puts us in a position that we could see I love that because God could deliver you anytime you think about it this way I don't mind don't mind if I talk a little bit God puts God allows you to go through things and he could deliver you at any time you know he could just snap his finger and change the situation you know I mean this is God we're talking about he could he could just change it just like that yes but then the question we have to ask ourselves is what have we learned from the experience we went through amen he's in control he's always on the throne don't ever forget that don't ever don't think that praise God the devil like for us not to think that he's he's not in control but he is always in control the problem is us we are not in control we are the ones who are supposed to be in his hands stay but a little but we will fall we are the ones who are supposed to be so dependent on him so looking to him so praying upon Him always watching ever always and cautious with our words and with our actions and on our deeds and checking up with ourselves on the word of God to see if we're living the way we ought to live we are the ones who need to change and we are the ones who God is putting through the experience so that we could learn something cuz that is the real treasure what you've learned from the experience that God put you through what have you learned from it because if he snaps your fingers and he just change situation you jump up and say hallelujah he saved me yay big rotorious whatever whatever and you learn nothing amen amen takes time see per Perfection takes time so that's where the honing comes that's where he put you over the table and he hone you hone you hone you hone you hone you hone you and it takes a long time and he's cutting and he's shaping and every day is painful more painful than the next but he's doing something in your life you just got to sit still in love long enough for him to do his work so that when you come out on the other side you're not the same as when you went but you're perfected by Christ perfected by circumstance that he is wisdom sends your away isn't that right I think about Hannah now she come in the temple sighing and crying and weeping and burning and oh she's under pain and pressure of her Circumstance the other wife is terrorizing her she's Barren she can't bring forth a child and she's there in the temple weeping and wailing sighing and bitter isn't that right all of a sudden the priest come up to her he's not right say why you why are you crying for what's what's the problem what what's going on what are you drunk what what's what's it what's the issue then she begin to tell the story what's been going on with her and her situation she begin to pour her heart out before him and all of a sudden he give her a word he say go go no more bitter pray go in the Peace of the Lord isn't that right everything's going to be all right and the Bible said from that time she changed her attitude from that time she went no more bitter she went no more sad she took the word from the priest oh Hallelujah and she went home rejoicing now she went back to the same wife she went back to her same comrade who's still giving her trouble she's still in the same situation she's still barring she still don't have any evidence that anything is going to get better but her attitude changed she took something what' she take she took the word oh H isn't that right and the Bible said after why the Lord visited Hanah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but something in her change and that's what's got to happen to us we are resisting we're fighting we're beaten up against the line and God's trying to reel Us in and God just have us there whole in that line holding that line until you tie out until you surrender until you you realize you're hooked Line and Sinker and you can't go nowhere where you keep fighting fighting I don't want to do this I want to do this like a child praise God and God have to be there patient with you waiting because he knows you're going to run out of steam sooner or later all of a sudden more able to take that word you begin to Mellow down you're going to get paid down and now your head is logged over amen pray now he can reel you in slowly praise God because you're losing the fight you're losing the the resistance you have your own will now you're willing to say not my will thy will be done you're willing to come to a getson experience where you are broken like a horse now you're ready to be trained by the master now you're ready to be bridled now you're ready to be girdled and have your loins G out you now you're ready to be clothed with a breastplate of righteousness a helmet of salvation God's ready to dress you right for the battle that laid ahead but you can't be resistant like the proud or arrogant you got to be humble you got to be in his hands so that he could move you where you wants to praise God Amen oh Hallelujah you got to be trained right you got to see things away here he sees it amen to see things like he does and when you can see things like he does you'll see people like he does and you'd be able to understand and on some you could have compassion praying for someone forgiving others amen recognizing the difference between brute beasts amen and those who are genuine those who have a desire in their hearts oh my I think I got away quite some time but do you love him tonight wonderful it's all about taking that wordu dying out to ourselves let me see if I can wrap up here in some way every patriarch Through the Bible took the word isn't that right isn't that right they took the word and they had to die out to themselves and when that happened God positionally placed them gave them power and sent them out and now they were able to hand it there amen speak the truth and love they were able to hand it there display power and anointing and presence but it's because those men were broken those men that were doing that were not not strong and great tribal powerful men these men were humbled by God God like a great Crusher crushed their humanness and crushed their their whole pride and arrogance and everything brought them ground them down to powder Moses spent 40 years in the desert making circles just there just sping his time God beat him out in the desert just out there all that he thought he was all the degrees he thought he had God let that disintegrate praise all let all that parchment disintegrating the Sands of the desert for 40 years he had no degrees to show nothing to show for he was mining his father-in-law's flock you have nothing to show for what he's been there all that year for till they come a burning bush now God is ready for Moses now God is ready to deliver his people and he have just the man to do it the man who can't talk the man who has St stering lips praise God the man who lack confidence God put a confidence in him pray God give him a burning bush experience and pack with his rod and saying go and tell my people tell pharaoh to let my people go amen that's the man God chose broken man that who God wants tonight broken people he wants contrite heart a broken Spirit he want to break all that Pride break all that lust break all that Envy break all that jealousy break it away from you amen takes time to do that yes sir Perfection takes time takes time to hone craft yes sir till it come down to Precision so that it could fit right into the plan that God has hallelujah amen because you were an odd thing when it started out but now you're coming more and more into what he wants you to be to fit right into the program of things seamless fit right in oh it's that right that's what the process does Amen it's not right okay me hurry along here wow so what happens if you're not trained you can't take that word see then that means you're taking something else maybe a Creed a Dogma an interpretation isn't that right praise God hallelujah isn't that right and what we' had in this message has been what we call an misinformation campaign that word has been tossed around a lot and there's a big misinformation campaign going on right now praise God how we are to get ready for this Rapture praise isn't that right people don't know what to do they think it's supposed to wear their hair long they think if they wear the dress long and they pay the tides they'll be ready for the Rapture no no no no you've got to have these things in you praise God you've got to meet this requirement praise God hallelujah The Keeper at the door God wants to see this shining out of your heart and life outside of that long hair and long dress won't do it joining Church won't do it it looks nice but it's just a start you've got to get up that pyramid brother praise God Amen Hallelujah isn't that right my amen that's what God requires out of every life praise God he wants to see these virtues living out of us praise God isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right okay let me hurry up here okay so see so we've got misinformation campaign crafted by Satan these are my words it to deceive the people away from receiving the holy ghost from adding to their faith virtue knowledge and so forth like isn't that right the B uh Prophet said here Christ in the mystery of God revealed he said God is known by Simplicity of revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's the revelation of Jesus Christ he said and Upon This Rock I'll build my church no other rocks are accepted no other things are accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he borns it in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone see what I mean now can't of your life jumping up fighting against God's life he's got to be able to inject his life into you your life goes out and his life comes in by these seven things isn't that right amen and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminence to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you Prophet said outside of that the rest is not even call to it at all oh my Hallelujah see what I mean now got to meet God's requirements Hallelujah isn't that right got to be born again got to go through place of trying got to be positionally placed then he sets in the Church some Apostles some are prophets some pastors teachers evangelist for the Perfection of the Saints praise God isn't that right Hallelujah then the whole thing begins to unfold when we come into God's program when we come God's provided way oh Hallelujah do you believe it amen all right outside of that it's not even called right see say said Watch God's greater unfolding he said and by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us because they didn't take the word they took something else they took their interpretting of what they thought it was and messed the whole picture up unfortunately isn't that right my lack of Revelation that's why we have so many divisions among us and so much mockery and so forth so much division among us because the people lacked that Revelation see they lack that Revelation the teachers Prophet say so he rested that responsibility of giving a correct Revelation upon the teachers cuz once the leadership is messed up it trickles all the way down pray God it affects the group the community the church the families you see so it starts with leadership amen so God wants a right leaders in place isn't that right praise God Amen all right my he said that group okay so let's talk about that group so today we believe that there's a group being prepared by the word of God they're being trained to take that word and hand it there with authority and power Prophet said here's the only hope I have this morning to wind up my message is while Samson was bound a new shock of hair growed out he said God sent send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit St Mark 16 can follow the church acts 2:4 acts 238 all of it will be following right along with the church he said signs wonders accompany the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompanying them he said but while we're in prison surely God tonight is growing a crop somewhere for that last great kill oh hallelujah hallelujah God's growing a group tonight oh that can feel them Seven Locks growing behind them somewhere know that this Covenant is being restored you're getting ready for that last great kill God will anoint you to destroy the enemy praise God Amen isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah glory amen that's who that group is tonight amen oh my may he said maybe you my Christian friend here it is here here this morning he said may it be your strength that begin to grow and I love this first you talk about the church so he says may the Holy Ghost come to the church demonstrations all of it be foll right along he said God sent us another church then now he comes now say may it be you my Christian friend yes sir see what he did there the church is made up of individuals who are able to Tabernacle this Holy Spirit in sir that's how you get into the church and the prophet is praying he said may it be you my Christian friend you be the the members of this glorious church that God is raising up in the last day oh it's made up of individuals because the Holy Ghost pours out upon individuals and he fits you into the headstone and you become a member of the machine of his body and the and the Dynamics Hallelujah sweeps over you praise God and brings the mechanics to life brings it all praise second Peter 1 14-7 brings it to life in you praise now become a living unit of Jesus Christ Healing The Sick raising the Dead everything else amen oh do you believe it tonight my God that's what it's been about amen it's the rising of the sun Prophet said there's been churches churches Brides brides churches churches Brides but there's got to come one musician can come get ready but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride yes sir there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it that makes the church live move in the power of his resurrection and here the prophet said until we come to that place until we find that place he said what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give our fael for some s simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work amen amen hallelujah hallelujah not just the word only but the power of the spirit demonstrations of the holy spirit that makes that word live that proves to the world that what we believe is Right praise God Amen that is God's word Hall that we're able to take that word all these years and now we can hand it there we could speak the truth in love we could place it correctly oh and say this is that that the prophet Joel spoke of this is that that the prophet Malachi for spoke of Amen isn't that right this is it here this is the Fulfillment oh hallelujah hallelujah and there's going to be a group that's raised up for such a time as this to manifest that word isn't that right oh my that's what proved it he said that's what Easter proved he said he wasn't only the word he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Christ that was cold stiff and dead in the grave shake to life and raise again isn't that right so it wasn't just the body but there was a life in there is there the life behind the name that made the demons trouble that made the body raise up praise God the secret was a life oh Hallelujah is not right and the secret is the life today the Life of Christ in you amen is not right by the seven Thunder praise God word life in you is what raises you up is what will raise that cold church tonight praise God to newness of Life praise God because you could take that word and hand it there praise God Amen oh my oh all right let me hurry up here I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars say he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize Prophet said that he is alive again because he raised it up isn't that right he was not only mechanics God's word but he was the Dynamics to prove it isn't that right I love this part he said here you can pleas something softly he said until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do all the things that he did he said he uh uh he hit on 16 cylinders he said so will the bride he said amen for he said St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also I give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics and the world will not be able to to withstand it oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God is not right he said uh I'll raise him up in the last day is not right he said you could scream you could shout you can jump all down you want to and deny this word he said it won't do any good you have to take that word and you have to hand it there he said you're just cranking around the Pistons if that's the case got the spark got the spark here to fire but no gasoline to fired by it Prophet said it will only work as they come together amen he said one will sit still and the other will go up that'll prove the difference isn't that right between those who can take the word and those who can't take it isn't that right oh my the only thing that there is see yet they might they might both look alike they both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has the mechanics and Dynamics and brings it to pass of what he said is the truth isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right glory to God let me read this final quote here and we finish all right there was voices how we need in Jefferson today thousands of live voices that's the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness you can begin this stand as we play Purity undefiled lives walking around in Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care
