[27:38] marty 5 48 one verse be there for
[27:40] perfect
[27:41] even as your father
[27:43] which is in heaven
[27:45] is perfect
[27:47] ephesians 4
[27:49] reading from verse 11 and he gave some
[27:51] apostles and some prophets and some
[27:53] evangelists and some pastors and
[27:55] teachers
[27:56] for the perfection of the saints for the
[27:59] work of the ministry
[28:00] for the eddy fine of the body of christ
[28:03] till we all come in the unity of the
[28:05] fate and of the knowledge of the son of
[28:07] god
[28:08] unto a perfect man
[28:10] unto the measure of the stature of the
[28:12] fullness
[28:14] of christ
[28:15] and from first peter
[28:16] chapter four
[28:18] i want to read from verse 12
[28:20] it reads beloved
[28:22] think it not strange concerning the
[28:24] fiery trial which is to try
[28:26] as do some
[28:28] strange thing happen unto you
[28:32] but rejoice
[28:33] in as much as your partakers of christ's
[28:36] sufferings
[28:37] that when his glory
[28:39] shall be revealed
[28:40] you may be glad also with exceeding joy
[28:45] if ye be reproached for the name of
[28:48] christ happier ye
[28:50] for the spirit of glory and of god
[28:53] rested upon you
[28:55] on their part he's evil spoken of but on
[28:58] your part he is glorified let's pray
[29:00] father we thank you
[29:02] for your holy word and i pray that you
[29:04] would
[29:06] take your spirit and make more sense of
[29:09] it today
[29:11] to every heart guarded here
[29:13] bring it in its simplicity of revelation
[29:15] and power
[29:16] that each person would leave here
[29:17] edified built up strengthened
[29:20] inspired i wanted to love you and be
[29:22] draw closer to you
[29:24] bless each one gathered here bless those
[29:26] that will be listening on the internet
[29:28] bless the whole internet community that
[29:30] will be connected to us this morning in
[29:32] a special remedy anointing sweep into
[29:34] their homes into their hearts into their
[29:36] lives and wherever this tape be played
[29:38] and jesus may ask it amen and amen you
[29:41] may be seated
[29:43] god bless you
[29:44] again it's a great privilege
[29:47] an honor for me to be here
[29:49] but i have something upon my heart
[29:52] that i believe is extremely important
[29:55] for the church
[29:56] today
[29:58] and i believe that that service
[30:00] they that wait upon the lord
[30:02] we want to continue
[30:04] not the exact line but continue along
[30:07] that vein
[30:08] because the prophet said perfection is
[30:10] patience written on god
[30:12] and waiting for god
[30:14] that is the process of character
[30:16] development
[30:17] so this morning i have a title
[30:19] commissioned
[30:21] to come to perfection
[30:24] commissioned
[30:25] to come to perfection
[30:27] and have a subject
[30:29] place of trying
[30:31] our inspiration
[30:34] let us go on to perfection
[30:37] the subject place of trying
[30:39] i will brackets around that
[30:42] the process of character development
[30:44] to continue that's what this place of
[30:46] trying
[30:48] is all about
[30:49] now the word commission
[30:51] is the act of granting certain powers
[30:54] or the authority
[30:56] to carry out a particular task or duty
[30:59] or document conferring such
[31:01] authorization
[31:03] or power that's granted
[31:05] so when jesus said
[31:07] be there for perfect
[31:09] even as your father
[31:12] which is in heaven is perfect it's a
[31:14] commission
[31:15] to perfection
[31:17] is saying you tier 4 does the amplified
[31:20] must be perfect
[31:21] and going deeper
[31:23] growing into complete maturity
[31:26] of godliness in mind and character
[31:30] having reached the proper height of
[31:32] virtue and integrity as your heavenly
[31:35] father is perfect
[31:37] so when we're talking about perfect
[31:39] we're talking about getting to the
[31:41] channel of really being mature
[31:43] understanding
[31:45] entirely admonished and taught
[31:48] mature in handling your issues in
[31:51] handling your trials that you wouldn't
[31:53] count it strange what is happening to
[31:56] you because you will understand that
[31:59] your trial of your faith is where
[32:01] patients get
[32:02] opportunity to work and patients must
[32:05] have its perfect work that you may be
[32:07] entire lacking nothing
[32:10] and in that trial and
[32:12] struggle is where character is developed
[32:16] and where you come to maturity like your
[32:19] father he was perfect or is mature
[32:22] having the wisdom and understanding to
[32:25] deal with the issues as they come your
[32:27] way so it wouldn't be be no more
[32:29] children toss to and fro blaming this
[32:32] one blaming that one making excuses but
[32:36] you will accept responsibility for your
[32:38] actions and your attitude
[32:40] knowing that god expect that of you as
[32:44] mature sons and daughters this is the
[32:46] service to put away the bibs and the
[32:49] baby stuff
[32:50] there's the service to put away the
[32:52] pacifiers and the thing you want to suck
[32:54] on this is that kind of service this is
[32:57] a service to wreck the church members
[32:59] and get the bride out
[33:01] feeling to be like brag to be mrs jesus
[33:04] christ this is that kind of service let
[33:06] us go on to perfection
[33:08] forget about church get somebody say
[33:10] amen
[33:11] let the church say here man hallelujah
[33:15] this is that kind of service
[33:17] to go on to move on to press on there's
[33:20] a goal
[33:21] that somebody won't achieve your custom
[33:22] just come in the church and going back
[33:24] home i challenge you this morning to go
[33:26] beyond that let's go on to perfection
[33:28] let's give the lord a shout a prayer
[33:41] okay
[33:44] just let me drop this before i start
[33:46] but abraham and what is the holy ghost
[33:48] said what
[33:50] is the holy ghost what is it
[33:53] now the reason i've taken this subject
[33:55] in line like this here we go
[33:58] you cannot receive the holy spirit
[34:01] therefore you can't be it if you have to
[34:03] receive it what we're talking about
[34:04] you're receiving it
[34:06] you cannot receive the holy spirit
[34:09] unless you know what it is
[34:11] and you cannot receive it
[34:13] if you know what it is unless you
[34:16] believe it's given to you
[34:18] and it's for you then you cannot know
[34:21] whether you got it or not unless you
[34:23] know the results it brings
[34:25] so if you know what it is and who it is
[34:28] to
[34:29] and what action it brings when it comes
[34:31] then you will know what you got when you
[34:34] get it
[34:35] can we give the lord a shout out praise
[34:38] god oh we are in the word today
[34:41] oh hallelujah
[34:44] so last week message title day that wait
[34:46] upon the lord
[34:47] subject waiting on god
[34:50] waiting for god
[34:52] the process of character development

[37:23] statue of moses
[37:25] being cut out of stone from a vision he
[37:27] had in his mind the otherness mind and
[37:29] his heart and his spirit nobody has had
[37:32] it because he had a vision isn't that
[37:34] right was his vision isn't that right
[37:37] and you see him hitting that rock
[37:38] knocking out things knocking out things
[37:40] and somebody who don't have the same
[37:42] vision they don't know what that man is
[37:44] doing
[37:45] they could criticize that man laugh at
[37:47] that man mocker that man but that man is
[37:50] who have the vision
[37:51] and he is knocking out things knocking
[37:54] out here knocking on here he is knocking
[37:56] out everything that is not moses

[38:28] oh glory to god amen
[38:31] so the burden
[38:32] many ideas of labor
[38:34] how we are to hold that same vision all
[38:36] the time
[38:38] in his mind and that's where people get
[38:39] wary
[38:41] and the bible says have you not heard
[38:42] the lord don't get wary you get tired
[38:44] when you have a vision oh man if they

[38:53] fixed
[38:54] god will have a vision and say you know
[38:55] what i change my mind i change my mind
[38:57] what kind of god is that if he's
[38:58] changing his mind god does not change
[39:00] his mind because he is perfect his first
[39:02] vision is perfect is if we could escape
[39:05] with the vision you see no one had a
[39:06] vision it was going to rain god didn't
[39:09] tell him next week it was 120 years and
[39:11] god didn't tell him 120 years he had to
[39:14] keep on preaching
[39:15] it's going to rain god said so
[39:18] and no only cutting down trees
[39:22] the ark is not built yet how god can say
[39:24] reign in the arkham built yet but know
[39:26] how to preach while the revelation is
[39:28] unfolding god said cut down this kind of

[39:38] foundation on the boat it's still going
[39:40] to rain
[39:42] for the vision to be completed come on
[39:45] come on now the fullness of time came to
[39:48] the fullness of the word to produce the
[39:50] fullness of the body isn't that right
[39:52] when the ark is complete now the message

[44:41] ordinary business that's called all kind
[44:43] of issues and problems and they'll find
[44:45] that and fight for as if we signed up
[44:47] for all of that
[44:50] but we did
[44:52] because all of that goes with the
[44:53] package

[45:36] package revival go with the package holy

[45:47] the package also
[45:50] oh
[45:51] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[45:55] that's why the bible says when you are

[46:01] walk up with everybody love you love you
[46:03] love you no glory resting upon you
[46:05] even the devil and always loving you
[46:07] oh sit down man
[46:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[46:12] so when he made man in his own image
[46:14] he reflected him
[46:16] god spoke through the image of man
[46:19] showing what he will do
[46:20] the perfect image
[46:22] god and morphe had changed here we go
[46:25] from supernatural
[46:27] division
[46:28] and the vision was projected like a
[46:30] projector the vision was projected into
[46:32] an image
[46:33] and the image was smitten
[46:36] so the supernatural could taste the
[46:38] feeling of debt
[46:39] god's perfect masterpiece
[46:43] then he started another pentecost to
[46:45] build another masterpiece
[46:46] original seed word started in the first
[46:49] church what was it the seed word the
[46:52] word manifested the promise that has
[46:55] been given and then he gave the
[46:56] scripture joel said have a scripture
[46:58] assigned to these things you know it
[46:59] shall come to pass i'll pour my spirit
[47:01] upon all flesh your sons and daughters
[47:03] shall prophesy old men shall dream
[47:05] dreams young men shall see visions amen
[47:08] this is not right notice it started out
[47:10] as original
[47:12] the word is a seed a source so watch the
[47:14] stalk don't look like the seed near
[47:16] there's a tassel but watch watch the
[47:19] tassel doesn't look like the seed the
[47:21] first thing the farmer is sitting here
[47:22] it forms a little outside tank to hold
[47:24] the seed form a husk the husk is not the
[47:26] seed no more the tassel that stalk was
[47:29] it's only a carrier of the life so
[47:32] you're talking about the life of christ
[47:33] right but the stalk carries the life the
[47:35] blade carries the life it's only
[47:38] carrying the life the life is on a
[47:40] journey to go somewhere
[47:42] when you put the seed in the life is in
[47:44] the seed
[47:45] locked up sealed up
[47:48] covered up wrapped up standing alone see
[47:52] looking to be buried but when that seed
[47:54] go in the ground it go through processes
[47:57] let's say the process of character
[47:58] development let's say the process of
[48:00] becoming a son of god let's say the
[48:02] process to become like jesus you see a
[48:05] lot of people want stuff but they don't
[48:07] want the process to get to that stuff if
[48:10] they want to get a certificate passing
[48:12] your exams you have to go through the
[48:14] process of studying your schoolwork
[48:16] because somebody say amen
[48:18] everything there's a process people want
[48:20] a shortcut there is no shortcut oh glory
[48:24] to god give the lord a shout
[48:27] in this word there is no shortcut
[48:30] you come on god's level or you don't
[48:33] come at all
[48:34] my god we're done preaching the church
[48:36] we are preaching to the bride that's who
[48:39] i feel i'm preaching to this morning
[48:46] oh
[48:47] hallelujah
[48:49] i feel the mature people here ready to
[48:51] take the wood and say pilate on me
[48:53] preacher
[48:54] pour it on
[48:55] hit me with it
[48:57] suck it to me
[48:59] give it to me
[49:01] loose it upon me
[49:03] that's what we want the word
[49:06] coming
[49:07] knocking out
[49:08] things that look like christ punching
[49:10] out things not like christ you're coming
[49:12] here for punches yes you're coming here
[49:14] to be cut you're coming here to be
[49:15] corrected you're coming to be instructed
[49:18] you're not coming here to give advice
[49:20] you're not coming to teach the preacher
[49:22] you're not coming to come and play god
[49:23] in this church no no you're not coming
[49:26] for that
[49:27] oh scripture is given my inspiration and
[49:30] is profitable for doctrine reproof
[49:32] instructions
[49:34] that's what we're here for
[49:36] we have not been this way before
[49:38] but pillar fire is here
[49:40] leading us
[49:41] guiding us that's why we are so inspired
[49:44] because there's a fire that is here oh
[49:46] glory to god and as we move closer
[49:48] trials will move hotter that's what the
[49:50] devil does as you're narrowing your
[49:52] portion devil is mad because he could
[49:55] never take your place he could never
[49:57] receive the holy ghost and he knows
[49:59] something is about to break forth we
[50:01] could sense it we could feel it we are
[50:03] inspired by the expectation of it
[50:06] something is about to break forth or a
[50:09] short quick message that could just
[50:11] shake the whole nation we know it's
[50:13] going to come what if it's going to come
[50:15] it's going to come because god said so
[50:31] expose at all
[50:32] he said he noticed when your body got a
[50:34] breakthrough in the forest he is praying
[50:36] mosquito coming all kind of thing
[50:37] disturbing him when he's just about
[50:39] taking the breakthrough it's mosquito
[50:41] with all kind of issues
[50:43] and all kind of demons want to come and
[50:45] pop yourself up because you're pushing a
[50:47] victory
[50:49] and they're trying to cut your victory
[50:50] off but today we gonna expose him we can
[50:54] have the victory anyhow
[50:56] come on now
[50:58] how many feet are going to have that
[50:59] victory
[51:00] i'm going to be leaving another victory
[51:02] oh god breathed up for victory
[51:04] oh glory to god
[51:07] early
[51:08] in jesus ministry
[51:10] he said be there for perfect
[51:12] as my father no lord jesus
[51:15] he don't wait for you to be where you
[51:17] supposed to be
[51:23] he could watch a woman say that's a
[51:25] butterfly
[51:31] from a human standpoint you see worm
[51:33] but from gotham he's about to fly so
[51:36] jesus see these rugged cuts bud
[51:40] hot tempered
[51:42] bed up some of them ben
[51:44] who he asked to follow him
[51:47] them guys wasn't easier
[51:51] they had family wasn't easy you know
[51:54] one and mother come to jesus i want two
[51:56] more boys one cent on your left and one
[51:58] side on your right there was the easier
[52:01] they were trusting one another to be
[52:03] next to him you know
[52:06] you think jesus didn't know all that
[52:08] inter-brederin issues among them
[52:10] minister so-called
[52:12] he knew all of that
[52:13] but he called all of them anyhow anyhow
[52:16] i'm not hearing you i'm not here
[52:22] but jesus didn't hold back
[52:24] what was their promise i love him that's
[52:26] what i love about him he's not going to
[52:28] hold back what he promised you he said
[52:31] be therefore perfect
[52:35] in other words i am commissioning you to
[52:37] be perfect
[52:42] and to prove
[52:44] that you're going to be perfect you may
[52:46] be seated
[52:50] i'm going to take the scriptures
[52:52] from ephesians 4
[52:55] 11-13
[52:57] and i'm going to elect
[52:59] predestinated
[53:01] for ordain
[53:02] these gifts
[53:04] apostles
[53:05] prophets
[53:06] teachers
[53:07] pastors evangelists
[53:10] four
[53:14] for
[53:16] the perfecting of the saints
[53:19] so when god wants to move to fulfill his
[53:22] word of commission you to be perfected
[53:25] it means god must elect a bunch of men
[53:29] not man chosen man but god
[53:33] god
[53:34] man
[53:41] but i want to bring it deeper
[53:43] i want to show you
[53:45] that the fifo ministry will be adopted
[53:48] sons
[53:54] not hoping to make it
[53:57] somebody may say i hope these words
[53:59] bless your heart
[54:01] this is not that
[54:02] and you know i mean i i already prepared
[54:05] nothing you know but i hope
[54:06] no not that we're talking about men
[54:09] that's speaking as the oracles of god
[54:12] man that has been in his presence men
[54:15] that heard from heaven men that have
[54:18] been in the presence of the pillar of
[54:20] fire and know that god is god that's
[54:24] what we're talking about because in the
[54:25] last days we have promised that the
[54:28] bride will be the final voice to the
[54:30] final age and he said once more the
[54:33] world will hear direct from god
[54:37] when last the word he had direct from
[54:39] god when god said malachi 4.
[54:42] read son of man luke 17 30 the world was
[54:45] hearing direct from god but he
[54:47] prophesied that the bride who is she she
[54:51] is still being called out
[54:54] because the bride has to have character
[54:56] the bride has to be flesh of his flesh
[54:58] bone of his bone spirit of his spirit
[55:01] therefore the bride must go to the
[55:03] process of corrupt corrupted development
[55:06] come on give the lord a shout of prayer
[55:08] devil the bride must come to her place
[55:12] of trying
[55:32] of trying pasta not going through your
[55:34] place of trying for you
[55:36] i know you want to preach sometimes
[55:38] that could do some interceding which is
[55:40] praying that's the easy part but when
[55:42] you talk about police are trying that's
[55:43] your place
[55:45] nobody can't go through that nobody can
[55:46] sign that up for you you know i'm going
[55:48] to take my husband's place for of trying
[55:49] no it doesn't work that way
[55:54] it's the trial of your faith
[55:57] not all your feet
[56:00] your
[56:02] your faith
[56:04] so we're looking to lean on somebody you
[56:06] see i catch all them ducking and hiding
[56:08] and bobbing and weaving and the docking
[56:09] behind this one because they think it's
[56:11] our fate is it no your
[56:14] fate he said i came to deliver defeat
[56:18] that was once delivered to the saints
[56:19] you see the faith is what led peter to
[56:21] do what he did
[56:23] their faith is what that people say
[56:24] silver and gold have i known such that
[56:26] that was the fate
[56:28] the faith said philip to the ethiopian
[56:30] eunuch the faith did that
[56:31] isn't that right the faith is what was
[56:33] leading these guys because they are sons
[56:35] not chicken sons
[56:40] there were eagles there
[56:42] i think we'll get it across better with
[56:44] eagles you see chickens have motherhood
[56:46] and manchester brooding and
[56:48] eagles different as soon as their age
[56:50] mother just flicked them out and you'll
[56:52] get them uncomfortable in their nests
[56:54] because everybody have a cool comfort
[56:56] spot in mother's nest
[56:59] and and they don't know yet they're not
[57:01] born to sit on a nest
[57:02] they were born to fly they don't even
[57:05] know the purpose of their wings they
[57:07] don't know the potential yet they only
[57:09] under mummy because mommy flies out and
[57:11] bring back food for them mommy flies out
[57:14] and see them mommy fires out and brings
[57:17] stuff for them but after a while they
[57:19] get too big for the nest it begins to
[57:21] get uncomfortable and mommy begins to
[57:23] rip off what was smooth and what was
[57:26] necessary when they were small
[57:28] until the sticks that was under all
[57:30] those smooth stuff begin to stick them
[57:32] up and it began to give them a very
[57:34] uncomfortable trying situation in which
[57:37] they find a cell can lie down this way
[57:39] because this thing pushing them here
[57:41] they can't take it easy here they're
[57:43] being sticked up the mommy is groundly
[57:45] trying to phase them out from phase two
[57:47] to phase three because there's three
[57:49] meat they have to fly
[57:52] come on see him as somebody so first you
[57:54] make it sticky in the nest make it
[57:57] uncomfortable and i hope god do that for
[58:00] you today make things so uncomfortable
[58:03] you feel we stick in here you're
[58:05] sticking here you don't even know if you
[58:06] want to come back to the church that's
[58:08] fine that's that's okay that's what we
[58:09] just want pride members inside of here
[58:11] we we want the church members they could
[58:13] go bye-bye
[58:16] but the bride she want the word she want
[58:19] god she want the word to become flesh
[58:24] come on shame and somebody
[58:26] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[58:29] glory
[58:31] because
[58:31] it's the same beat the same way this
[58:33] until something external happens so the
[58:36] morning the mother decides
[58:38] to give them fellas a solo flight
[58:40] tell them jump in my wings and they hook
[58:42] their beaks into the brit mother eagle
[58:44] wings and the mother take my fly man
[58:46] that feeling good they feeling the
[58:48] merry-go-round

[58:51] everything just go up and down so and
[58:52] the mother is doing like that and
[58:54] they're feeling good maybe she did that

[1:06:13] of the spirit all the world blinking
[1:06:15] here look at me look at me look at me
[1:06:17] and you're trying to hold your eyes

[1:06:21] trying to walk through this narrow road
[1:06:24] praise god and when you pass through

[1:06:32] the person next to you is your brother
[1:06:34] the person that you is your sister don't

[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:53] oh
[1:06:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:56] glory to god
[1:06:58] so god put an original seed
[1:07:02] into the ground and that seed began to
[1:07:04] unfold now here what happened notice the
[1:07:07] life that was in the stalk
[1:07:09] the tassel ends up in the seed
[1:07:12] the light that come with the original
[1:07:13] seal come to different processes and
[1:07:16] then turn back there we go to its
[1:07:18] original condition
[1:07:20] so when the life begins to unfold
[1:07:22] through the stalk through the leaves to
[1:07:24] the tassel it comes back against the
[1:07:26] seed
[1:07:27] then the life gathers all the seed
[1:07:29] gardens up all the life
[1:07:31] then everything else dries up
[1:07:33] so when you begin to see others just
[1:07:34] drying up that's not you
[1:07:37] you're not drying up you getting ripened
[1:07:39] up
[1:07:40] you're getting mature you're getting to
[1:07:42] be perfect
[1:07:44] oh
[1:07:45] hallelujah oh glory notice this is the
[1:07:48] bomb the life that was in the store husk
[1:07:52] in the tassel gathers up in the seed the
[1:07:54] life that was in the stalk went to make
[1:07:57] another justification made away for
[1:08:00] sanctification
[1:08:01] certification made a way for the baptism
[1:08:03] of the holy ghost and the baptism of the
[1:08:05] holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost
[1:08:07] itself to come down in perfection the
[1:08:10] holy ghost must come down in
[1:08:12] perfection therefore there is going to
[1:08:15] be a perfect people
[1:08:16] on the earth the holy ghost is going to
[1:08:18] come down
[1:08:20] in perfection and back to the word to
[1:08:23] manifest itself
[1:08:25] so brahman says when the green life
[1:08:28] begins to leave the husk
[1:08:30] and go to make the brain
[1:08:32] the bride
[1:08:33] he called the bride
[1:08:35] the grain
[1:08:36] the green cardinal itself
[1:08:38] so when the wood is thrown at you you
[1:08:40] can't say you don't believe that you
[1:08:41] accept that when all these promises is
[1:08:44] flung at you you receive them because he
[1:08:46] said the green listen when the life
[1:08:49] begins to leave the host to go into the
[1:08:51] green the bride the house open up and
[1:08:54] excommunicate the grain so this is part
[1:08:56] of the package ex
[1:08:58] communication
[1:09:00] how could brethren do me that
[1:09:02] do you they have to do you that because
[1:09:05] you are green
[1:09:07] and that's husk
[1:09:08] pulling back to give you room
[1:09:14] you're not hearing me
[1:09:18] do you realize they were tightening you
[1:09:20] all along cramping you all along but
[1:09:21] when the hospital back
[1:09:24] you feel the dance like david dance
[1:09:26] you have the liberty you have the
[1:09:28] freedom you have the authority you have
[1:09:30] inspiration why because pull that they
[1:09:34] have to pull back
[1:09:35] they call they can handle the green
[1:09:37] the green could only get right you see
[1:09:40] while it is not ready the grain is
[1:09:43] protected by the husk
[1:09:45] while it is young the husk is green
[1:09:48] and the grain is green but then ghosts
[1:09:51] are going to increase the sun
[1:09:53] here
[1:09:54] place a trial
[1:09:56] trial of your faith that increase the
[1:09:58] test
[1:09:59] and as the sun get hotter the huts begin
[1:10:02] to go dry
[1:10:03] yellow but the grain starting to get
[1:10:05] ripe golden brown you call it
[1:10:08] golden brown it begins to get mature
[1:10:12] because it's getting ready to die
[1:10:14] the dynamic is going to drive the people
[1:10:16] to calvary and get into the rapture
[1:10:19] oh glory to god but you've got to become
[1:10:22] the grain that's why you come to church
[1:10:24] by these promises we become partakers of
[1:10:28] the divine nature you come to church to
[1:10:31] get promised after promise of the
[1:10:33] promise
[1:10:37] lord
[1:10:38] god didn't come to church for me to
[1:10:40] explain newsweek magazine
[1:10:42] and thai magazine on an article in in in
[1:10:45] in some science magazine that's not what
[1:10:47] to come to church for they come to
[1:10:49] church and your promises
[1:10:50] god promised you the holy ghost god
[1:10:52] promised you deliverance god promised
[1:10:54] you family god promised you a
[1:10:56] breakthrough you come to your promises
[1:10:59] and your faith has taken a hold
[1:11:01] of these promises
[1:11:03] my god you could take them and say god
[1:11:04] you said so
[1:11:06] you can't lie
[1:11:15] my lord
[1:11:17] and when the seed word begins to go
[1:11:19] forward the husk puts it from itself
[1:11:23] here we go you ready for this the life
[1:11:27] leaves all the others to follow it
[1:11:30] and that's the true believers they
[1:11:32] follow the life wherever the life goes
[1:11:37] not
[1:11:38] interpretation not more mysteries the
[1:11:41] life
[1:11:42] related years for the life
[1:11:44] seven angels give him eternity to guard
[1:11:46] up this cattle world to tie it back into
[1:11:48] the world to bring down the life which
[1:11:50] was the holy ghost itself and the holy
[1:11:52] ghost came down but he couldn't give us
[1:11:54] the holy ghost it came long as the word
[1:11:57] because the mystery of god comes down
[1:11:59] from god as the word and the word is the
[1:12:01] seed and the seed has to be preached
[1:12:11] that's why the devil
[1:12:13] didn't understand
[1:12:14] the mystery of god
[1:12:16] because
[1:12:17] the mystery is or the secret is the word
[1:12:21] is in the brain
[1:12:22] devil didn't understand that he didn't
[1:12:24] understand the word wasn't in your
[1:12:25] spirit or your flesh yet it was in your
[1:12:28] soul you had a gene inside a deer and
[1:12:31] because you were covered up
[1:12:33] by the shock of your spirit by the shock
[1:12:35] of your flesh but the seed of the
[1:12:38] attribute of who you are was inside your
[1:12:41] soul so the shock could have done this
[1:12:43] adultery and fornication and lie that
[1:12:46] has nothing with the seed the mystery
[1:12:48] that was inside the there now the
[1:12:50] mystery was how to connect what was in
[1:12:52] your soul to what god spoke because
[1:12:54] elohim is thought logos is word word is
[1:12:58] taught express and once the word is
[1:13:00] spoken the word become the conductor of
[1:13:02] the spirit to make it come to pass so
[1:13:05] once god thinks it and he speaks it and
[1:13:08] the spirit flows through it it's got to
[1:13:10] come to prayer
[1:13:14] glory
[1:13:16] glory
[1:13:18] glory
[1:13:19] are you with me
[1:13:21] are you with me
[1:13:22] so watch god say let there be light
[1:13:24] hallelujah god created and he said about
[1:13:27] it there was darkness and the spirit
[1:13:29] began to move you see because the word
[1:13:31] has to be spoken for the spirit to begin
[1:13:34] to move because the word is the
[1:13:36] conductor of the spirit so god has to
[1:13:38] restore the conductor of the spirit
[1:13:41] which is the word and once the word is
[1:13:43] restored the spirit can now move so when
[1:13:46] the suns become the word the sun become
[1:13:49] the conductor and the spirit begin to
[1:13:51] move through the sons of god the last
[1:13:53] days there is my spirit flowing freely
[1:14:11] you are sealed
[1:14:13] i see your shoes on both sides
[1:14:15] whether you're going to come in
[1:14:17] they see the reel just the same
[1:14:18] when a man or woman possesses this
[1:14:21] all these virtues here
[1:14:23] then
[1:14:24] the capstone comes down
[1:14:26] and seals them into the kingdom of god
[1:14:29] which is the holy ghost
[1:14:31] then the word
[1:14:32] manifests itself
[1:14:34] that makes it a complete tabernacle of
[1:14:36] the living god
[1:14:37] hallelujah
[1:14:39] my
[1:14:39] then you become watch a living example
[1:14:42] of christianity
[1:14:44] what christ was
[1:14:45] these people are because his life is in
[1:14:48] there they are in christ and their life
[1:14:51] is dead
[1:14:52] and then you reckon yourself there then
[1:14:55] you're born of faith
[1:14:57] then virtue and these are the things
[1:14:59] that added tell you a perfect living
[1:15:01] image
[1:15:02] of god
[1:15:03] isn't that right
[1:15:04] and it's not wonderful
[1:15:06] god has brought seven church ages to
[1:15:09] show seven steps he brought building
[1:15:11] this individual into his image he built
[1:15:13] a complete church in his image and at
[1:15:15] the resurrection this complete body will
[1:15:18] be raised up to live with him forever
[1:15:21] because it's a bride
[1:15:22] just remember we are not the only bride
[1:15:24] we are the capstone bride the bride have
[1:15:27] been formed throughout the ages it's
[1:15:29] already filled up so we can't go back to
[1:15:31] luta we can't fit into wesley we can't
[1:15:33] fit in any passage we have to fit in our
[1:15:36] age we have to fit in the magnetism of
[1:15:38] the holy ghost to pull the rest of them
[1:15:40] up so we are the capstone that the holy
[1:15:43] ghost itself could come down as that
[1:15:46] power magnet to raise them from the
[1:15:48] grave in other words we have got to come
[1:15:50] to perfection in order to produce a
[1:15:52] resurrection isn't that right
[1:15:55] you are going to be perfect
[1:15:57] you got to press on to perfection
[1:15:59] perfection is our goal
[1:16:00] isn't that right
[1:16:02] oh glory to god what more shall we say
[1:16:05] to these things hebrews 11
[1:16:07] oh true faith subdued kingdoms brought
[1:16:09] righteousness there were stones sword

[1:16:13] report true fate god provides some
[1:16:16] things better for us they without us are
[1:16:18] not made perfect so they need us to
[1:16:21] complete them
[1:16:22] oh glory to god do you understand what
[1:16:24] i'm saying they need us to complete them
[1:16:28] to bring up the whole body that's the
[1:16:30] responsibility
[1:16:31] that's been given this last day church
[1:16:33] we are not a church to produce another
[1:16:35] church we are church to raise the dead
[1:16:38] to tell me a resurrection come on say

[1:17:24] these people who die
[1:17:25] i depend on them waiting on us
[1:17:28] here we go look at my moments so this
[1:17:30] church has got to come to perfection in
[1:17:34] order to bring the resurrection

[1:17:46] watch it's come to a needle point we
[1:17:49] have got to get into a place here we go
[1:17:51] until it's the same kind of ministry
[1:17:54] that was left
[1:17:57] because when the heads don't come
[1:17:59] it can't come and connect the brotherly
[1:18:00] kindness there it has to come and that
[1:18:02] holy spirit is where the ministry

[1:18:24] that dealing delivered metal work
[1:18:26] according to a sharp point
[1:18:28] milliliter i forget all these scales we
[1:18:30] see this long time
[1:18:31] uh caliper
[1:18:33] caliper sometimes they grab fat and
[1:18:34] ground thin another jersey caliper
[1:18:36] because you have to get it this fraction
[1:18:38] so you had to hone that
[1:18:40] go through a process of honing wholeness
[1:18:42] processing you're just chopping you know
[1:18:44] a whole nother chocolate no
[1:18:49] they don't want to see one another right
[1:18:51] they're actually feeling it there
[1:18:58] the real thing coming
[1:18:59] so if i say um and that affecting you
[1:19:01] much is when your relating gonna come
[1:19:03] this is what we're talking about
[1:19:05] the real thing going to come

[1:19:29] so therefore it has to be so perfect
[1:19:31] like christ till when it comes he and
[1:19:33] that ministry will fit smug together
[1:19:37] then will the rapture come
[1:19:40] so somebody kaka boy rapper wrap the

[1:20:10] talking about the ministry
[1:20:12] fifa ministry the ministry comes with
[1:20:14] perfection when when it preaches
[1:20:16] mysteries when i have more mysteries to
[1:20:18] preach deeper mysteries hit the
[1:20:20] mysteries no listen to this the ministry
[1:20:23] come to its perfection when
[1:20:26] it reproduced christ again in natural
[1:20:30] among human being
[1:20:37] christ have to be oozing out that man
[1:20:41] reproduce not spiritual
[1:20:45] these are not plain words you know
[1:20:46] reproduce in
[1:20:48] natural
[1:20:50] he healed the sick he raised the dead
[1:20:53] but a branham i understand when he
[1:20:55] walked there was an anointing around him
[1:20:58] you couldn't just walk up to him but no
[1:21:00] you couldn't do that you got checked
[1:21:02] because of wrong hymn there was a glory
[1:21:04] and there was a power and there was a
[1:21:06] presence just like jesus
[1:21:11] so indeed called the deep woman coming
[1:21:14] up and woman just doing but he said that
[1:21:16] just his presence
[1:21:21] and he's living in this
[1:21:23] he is walking in this
[1:21:25] he is operating in this and that's going
[1:21:28] to come back
[1:21:30] you'll be living in it
[1:21:32] you'll be walking in it
[1:21:33] you'll be part of your being
[1:21:36] christ in you
[1:21:38] the hope of glory
[1:21:40] oh give the lord a shout of praise
[1:21:46] from the unveiling of god yeah written
[1:21:48] epistles of all men
[1:21:50] turn that around just turn around yeah
[1:21:52] epistles
[1:21:53] that have been written
[1:21:55] and peter and john to show it when they
[1:21:57] went up there they perceived they were
[1:21:59] ignorant and unlearned they had no
[1:22:01] education but they take notice that
[1:22:03] they've been with jesus they were
[1:22:05] ignorant and unlearned but they were
[1:22:07] written epistles
[1:22:09] read
[1:22:10] that they had been with jesus cause here
[1:22:12] we go
[1:22:13] jesus
[1:22:15] was manifesting himself through them
[1:22:18] christ
[1:22:19] veiled in their flesh
[1:22:21] manifested made alive as was in moses
[1:22:26] oh hallelujah christ
[1:22:28] veiled
[1:22:29] manifested in them he said now watch
[1:22:31] that's the thing god will do to his sons
[1:22:33] on earth someday he will call you a side
[1:22:35] church if you'll only obey him and stay
[1:22:37] on the word and believe it he replaced
[1:22:40] into the church before the coming of
[1:22:41] jesus christ he replaced into the church
[1:22:43] all the powers that christ had in him
[1:22:45] will be in the church all that god was
[1:22:48] he poured into jesus all that jesus was
[1:22:50] he pours into the church god wanted his
[1:22:52] work done he sent it to his son the son
[1:22:54] wanted his work done sent into the
[1:22:56] church at that day you will know i am in
[1:22:58] the father the father me and you and me
[1:23:00] and i knew at that day because here we
[1:23:03] go the same power of god was the jehovah
[1:23:05] god rest in jesus christ and the same
[1:23:08] power that rest in jesus christ rest in
[1:23:11] placed sons in the body of christ
[1:23:15] not place son's place in conventions
[1:23:19] place sons in the body
[1:23:22] now no man could put you in the body if
[1:23:25] by one spirit you are baptized into the
[1:23:27] body isn't that right so the holy ghost
[1:23:29] puts you into the body and in that body
[1:23:32] you have a position
[1:23:37] are you with me
[1:23:39] oh hallelujah the pillar of fire is
[1:23:40] identified significantly by the reaction
[1:23:43] by its character and everything else and
[1:23:46] as it was when it was dwelling in the
[1:23:47] body of god's only begotten son so that
[1:23:49] it dwell in the body of his adopted sons
[1:23:52] for the last day amen let's read back
[1:23:55] the scripture we read
[1:23:56] how highly god regardless of woken up
[1:23:58] patience is seen in james 1 4 let
[1:24:00] patients have a perfect work that you
[1:24:02] may perfect an entire lack of nothing
[1:24:04] god's will for us is perfection that's
[1:24:06] his will
[1:24:07] that's his will
[1:24:09] that's why jezebel for perfect he put
[1:24:11] that promise upon the pedia for perfect
[1:24:13] holy perfect except there are seven
[1:24:14] perfect spirits to be loosed on the
[1:24:16] earth to wrap you up in it these dumb
[1:24:18] spirits come from god to bring it back
[1:24:20] to perfection remember the working in
[1:24:22] the beginning
[1:24:24] but the seventh experiment was before
[1:24:25] the beginning
[1:24:26] that's where our gene took a hold
[1:24:29] before the beginning lucifer only come
[1:24:31] in the beginning
[1:24:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:24:37] word said let there be angels let there
[1:24:38] be this let there be that let it be lucy
[1:24:44] are you with me but before the beginning
[1:24:47] was spirit taught that we were connected
[1:24:51] so before the devil was created we were
[1:25:00] oh glory to god amen
[1:25:03] okay let's go
[1:25:04] hebrews 2 9.
[1:25:08] we see jesus
[1:25:09] who has been a little lower than the
[1:25:11] angels for the suffering of death
[1:25:13] crowned with glory and honor
[1:25:15] and he
[1:25:16] by the grace of god should take debt for
[1:25:18] every man
[1:25:19] for it became him
[1:25:21] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:25:23] all things in bringing many sons unto
[1:25:26] glory to make the captain of their
[1:25:29] salvation
[1:25:31] perfect true suffering
[1:25:36] that's jesus
[1:25:37] perfect
[1:25:39] to suffering hebrews five eight to nine
[1:25:42] though he was a son
[1:25:44] yet
[1:25:45] learnt he obedient
[1:25:48] so sorry i'm not so sorry i'll be
[1:25:50] another gift
[1:25:57] no no you have to learn obedience but
[1:25:59] here it is he learned
[1:26:02] obedience
[1:26:03] by the things which he suffered
[1:26:10] oh now the babies
[1:26:12] the babies feel uncomfortable right now
[1:26:18] and being made perfect
[1:26:21] he became the order of eternal salvation
[1:26:24] unto all them that obey him
[1:26:26] first peter 5 10 but the god of all
[1:26:29] grace
[1:26:30] who had called us to his eternal glory
[1:26:33] by christ jesus
[1:26:34] after you have suffered a while
[1:26:37] make you perfect
[1:26:38] establish
[1:26:40] strengthen
[1:26:42] settle you
[1:26:43] okay give the lord a praise
[1:26:52] we pray for the course of the word and
[1:26:54] god has a set time and has a purpose for
[1:26:56] everything that he does there's nothing
[1:26:58] happen just accidentally to those who
[1:26:59] love the lord and accord according to
[1:27:01] his will isn't that right we are
[1:27:03] predestinated and everything works just
[1:27:05] right for that because it cannot lie and
[1:27:08] everything has its time
[1:27:09] it's season it has its way
[1:27:12] god is behind every move
[1:27:15] and sometimes you think that everything
[1:27:18] is going wrong
[1:27:19] it's up to us here we go
[1:27:21] those things are put upon us
[1:27:24] trials
[1:27:25] and wanderings it is testing to see
[1:27:30] how you will react on an action
[1:27:34] god
[1:27:35] by putting trials testings and
[1:27:37] wanderings to see how you would to fear
[1:27:40] how you gonna make out because he's
[1:27:42] looking for a reaction from you
[1:27:45] based upon the situations that is
[1:27:48] surrounding your life
[1:27:50] are you with me
[1:27:52] no matter if you notice she has made
[1:27:54] herself ready so many says if the lord
[1:27:55] will take his evil spirit from me from
[1:27:57] drinking from gambling from lying
[1:27:59] stealing i'll save him that's up to you
[1:28:02] you have got something to do they didn't
[1:28:04] overcome shall inherit all things they
[1:28:07] they'll overcome you have power to do it
[1:28:10] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:28:12] she has made herself ready you see god
[1:28:15] could not push us through a pipe and
[1:28:17] pull us on the other end and say blessed
[1:28:19] that he will overcome it you have
[1:28:20] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:28:22] through but you have got to make
[1:28:24] decisions yourself
[1:28:26] i had to make a decision myself and in
[1:28:29] doing that we show our faith and
[1:28:31] respects to god
[1:28:32] could we say amen
[1:28:35] are you with me
[1:28:36] so therefore the choices is yours you
[1:28:38] are the decision if you're going to come
[1:28:39] to church this morning and you have a
[1:28:41] decision this morning if you're going to
[1:28:42] stay alive to hear the word of worship
[1:28:45] or praise god and receive it because we
[1:28:47] are going to go on to perfection
[1:28:50] there's going to be a bunch of people in
[1:28:51] here that are going to press on
[1:28:53] the perfection
[1:28:55] could we take some more
[1:28:56] it's early
[1:28:58] and i'm not getting warmed up
[1:29:00] hallelujah
[1:29:02] glory glory glory
[1:29:03] no watch abraham was promised a child
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:08] but he must maintain that promise
[1:29:11] for 25 years
[1:29:13] promise maintenance
[1:29:16] promise given
[1:29:18] and god checking your how you're
[1:29:20] maintaining that promise
[1:29:21] or your disbelieve in the promise or
[1:29:23] you're grumbling about the promise or
[1:29:25] you're complaining why it's staying so
[1:29:26] long and you alter the spirit with the
[1:29:28] promise no maintenance
[1:29:30] you have to maintain it
[1:29:31] listen the ups and downs
[1:29:34] that he had
[1:29:35] the temptations
[1:29:37] in those 25 years
[1:29:39] but he held to the word
[1:29:41] of promise
[1:29:44] so wait a minute you think abram was

[1:33:50] be careful
[1:33:51] a chaplain is there for you
[1:33:53] i come back to about a friend went to
[1:33:55] church at night i know to the people
[1:33:57] next night it happened standing there he
[1:33:59] told me
[1:34:00] upon some muckers it's in your hands do
[1:34:01] what then whatever you happen
[1:34:04] a young man and young woman they're
[1:34:06] trying to make vulgar love with her in
[1:34:07] the building
[1:34:09] everybody attention
[1:34:11] while i was trying to preach
[1:34:13] this is in the church in the building
[1:34:15] now then people carry on in the building
[1:34:18] you'll notice they say come in
[1:34:24] in that kind of a way people are
[1:34:25] throwing people out you know but this
[1:34:26] would happen right
[1:34:28] and he was pull her head back climb up
[1:34:29] onto our lap to her head back trying to
[1:34:31] kiss her going on that
[1:34:33] and baron beg them stop it please stop
[1:34:34] it please all of a sudden the holy
[1:34:36] spirit dropped down and says he's there
[1:34:37] in your hands
[1:34:39] what will you do with them
[1:34:42] there was a holy hush
[1:34:44] everybody said deadly quiet i thought oh
[1:34:46] god what must i do
[1:34:48] so he's under pressure now
[1:34:50] what do i do this is a situation what do
[1:34:52] i do
[1:34:54] then i remember
[1:34:55] the warning of the holy spirit two days
[1:34:57] before
[1:34:58] and i said
[1:34:59] i forgive you
[1:35:05] now now i want you to go a little deeper
[1:35:08] in this
[1:35:09] the holy spirit if they say blind
[1:35:11] they'll be blind if he said that they
[1:35:12] will die whatever you say is going to
[1:35:15] happen
[1:35:16] and he listened to all the options given
[1:35:18] to him annie ball he said i
[1:35:22] forgive you now he didn't have to say
[1:35:23] that he gonna say that
[1:35:26] i'll show you who i am
[1:35:29] but he said
[1:35:30] i forgive you
[1:35:32] and that pleased god
[1:35:34] and that is what he wanted me to say
[1:35:37] because here we go after all i've been
[1:35:40] guilty
[1:35:41] maybe not of that
[1:35:43] but i have been guilty
[1:35:45] and guilty of the lease is guilty of the
[1:35:48] whole
[1:35:49] so you are do i have to play
[1:35:50] self-righteous you'd have to play more
[1:35:52] spiritual you'd have to play you more
[1:35:54] holy than somebody else
[1:35:58] so cut it out
[1:36:03] cut it out
[1:36:05] you'd have to play more legalistic than
[1:36:07] somebody else
[1:36:09] cut it out because we're rejecting that
[1:36:12] this is the word
[1:36:14] god forgive me he could forgive you and
[1:36:17] if he can forgive you he could forgive
[1:36:19] me too
[1:36:20] oh give the lord
[1:36:22] praise
[1:36:27] watch
[1:36:29] then the holy spirit fell through amen
[1:36:32] you see here we go this is what i want
[1:36:34] to get
[1:36:35] i believe
[1:36:36] that all these things had a meaning
[1:36:39] what would you do with the power
[1:36:42] the reaction of an action sometimes
[1:36:45] something that is come as an act then
[1:36:47] how do you react do you understand what
[1:36:50] i mean
[1:36:51] so therefore the world has always borne
[1:36:53] a reproach
[1:36:54] god's anointed word has all been
[1:36:56] reproached and that's the reason it's so
[1:36:58] hard for people who doesn't understand
[1:37:00] how to accept that reproach
[1:37:02] cover your knees
[1:37:04] everybody above their knees everybody
[1:37:06] have that you want a dress that you
[1:37:07] don't want to reproach they call your
[1:37:09] old lady all want what's what is that
[1:37:12] that dino approach
[1:37:13] that is crap that's there's a cross
[1:37:15] you're in calvary you you nailed to the
[1:37:17] cross with her
[1:37:20] dress modestly that's a reproach it have
[1:37:22] sinners let us dress modestly
[1:37:28] i want to repeat that it have sinful
[1:37:30] people that are dressed modestly
[1:37:34] women who respect themselves dress
[1:37:37] modestly those who dress in crazy they
[1:37:39] don't respect themselves that's why it's
[1:37:41] a spirit upon them it's a sex spirit
[1:37:43] upon them that is why they dress the way
[1:37:44] they dress don't let that sex spirit
[1:37:46] come on you
[1:37:47] to dress that kind of way whether in
[1:37:49] church or out of church where the
[1:37:51] private no don't let that come upon you
[1:37:53] because this is the word this is god
[1:37:59] remember the devil's not playing people
[1:38:02] playing in church but the devil's not
[1:38:03] playing he come to steal
[1:38:06] to rob
[1:38:07] and to destroy
[1:38:09] at the end of it he ought to destroy
[1:38:11] your life
[1:38:12] so be careful
[1:38:14] oh hallelujah
[1:38:16] so you always have to stand this
[1:38:18] reproach
[1:38:19] in order to give a testing amen or that
[1:38:22] live godly in christ jesus shall bear
[1:38:25] persecution
[1:38:26] hallelujah so what you're complaining
[1:38:29] about

[1:39:24] every child that coming to god must
[1:39:25] first be
[1:39:26] child trained for the purpose that god

[1:47:38] him
[1:47:39] he saw the spirit of god descending like
[1:47:41] a dove
[1:47:42] lighting upon him and a voice from him
[1:47:45] saying this is my beloved son in whom
[1:47:49] i am well pleased

[1:48:30] i'm pleased with him
[1:48:32] i'm pleased to send him out
[1:48:35] here's where
[1:48:38] then was jesus let up
[1:48:40] oh we are feeling mature inside here
[1:48:42] a few people receiving the word now we
[1:48:45] we in the scriptures now but a punch
[1:48:47] then was jesus let up of the spirit
[1:48:50] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:48:52] devil
[1:48:56] i'm listening
[1:48:58] i'm listening
[1:49:01] i'm the amen
[1:49:03] thermometer
[1:49:04] on the word
[1:49:07] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:49:09] nights he was hungered
[1:49:12] that's terrible
[1:49:14] after
[1:49:16] he fasted the devil come to tempt him
[1:49:18] with
[1:49:19] some fresh bread
[1:49:23] i mean you could smell it
[1:49:26] when you're hungry like that so i mean
[1:49:27] you could eat anything
[1:49:31] and the devil said if that will be the
[1:49:34] son of god command that these stone be
[1:49:36] made bread
[1:49:37] and he answered and said is written
[1:49:39] man shall never break alone by every

[1:50:06] against a stone it's incredible how he
[1:50:08] just finds scriptures and come to go to
[1:50:09] jesus
[1:50:11] and jesus said it is written again
[1:50:14] thou shalt not attempt the lord thy god
[1:50:15] again the devil taken up exceeding high
[1:50:18] mountain showed him all the kingdom of

[1:50:29] light god and him
[1:50:31] then the devil leave him ambul angels
[1:50:34] came and ministered to him
[1:50:37] luke 4 14 and jesus returned in the
[1:50:39] power of the spirit on the galilee and
[1:50:42] they went out of fame of him
[1:50:43] throughout the region roundabout
[1:50:46] that captures the whole thing
[1:50:48] of the identifying the sun a son placed
[1:50:51] by the holy spirit sent out into the
[1:50:54] wilderness to be tested and then return
[1:50:56] the power of the spirit so therefore the
[1:50:58] dove came on him and positioned him as a
[1:51:01] son
[1:51:02] him being positioned as a son
[1:51:04] was immediately led by the spirit into
[1:51:07] the wilderness to defeat the devil by
[1:51:10] the weed
[1:51:12] this is very important now
[1:51:14] no power yet
[1:51:16] but the word
[1:51:17] it is written it is written it is
[1:51:19] written
[1:51:20] so one spirit come upon him to identify
[1:51:23] him as a son isn't that right two the
[1:51:26] spirit led him into the wilderness
[1:51:28] where he used the word and that trial
[1:51:31] was jesus place of trying where you have
[1:51:34] to overcome
[1:51:35] himself
[1:51:37] lust of the eyes
[1:51:38] lust of the flesh
[1:51:40] pride of life so many ministers want to
[1:51:41] take power over the people
[1:51:43] poor lies pover churches and so on and
[1:51:46] you know really powerful men just like
[1:51:48] governments and prime ministers and
[1:51:49] presidents but they don't want to take
[1:51:51] the power over themselves
[1:51:53] but before a son could be really adopted
[1:51:55] he has to have power over himself
[1:51:58] before he could have power over others
[1:52:00] so jesus demonstrate this in the
[1:52:02] wilderness isn't that right
[1:52:03] led by the spirit then go into the
[1:52:06] wilderness to be tested to overcome the
[1:52:08] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the
[1:52:10] pride of life isn't that right
[1:52:12] but around ask a question why would god
[1:52:15] call our people out in this evil age 4
[1:52:18] to try her
[1:52:21] i want you to say amen on that
[1:52:24] why this is some god
[1:52:25] what would god call our people out of
[1:52:27] this energy for his name the reason is
[1:52:30] to try her the bride isn't that right
[1:52:32] blessed being of the lord so after
[1:52:35] defeating the devil by the word tested
[1:52:37] proven isn't that right he returned in
[1:52:40] the power of the spirit showing that the
[1:52:42] spirit he received turned into word he
[1:52:44] went to the test by the word and then
[1:52:46] the word turned back into spirit he
[1:52:48] returned to the power of the spirit the
[1:52:50] spirit and the word is the same could we
[1:52:52] say amen
[1:52:53] oh glory to god the words that he speak
[1:52:55] they are spirit and they are life isn't
[1:52:57] that right
[1:52:58] so therefore we find out in the old
[1:53:00] testament caleb was the only one that
[1:53:01] drive the philistines the other tribes
[1:53:04] failed we don't want to be like that you
[1:53:06] don't want to be like that you want to
[1:53:08] be the tribe that overcome and drive out
[1:53:11] your philistines so you have to fight
[1:53:13] isn't that right because there is going
[1:53:15] to be a battle to possess your
[1:53:17] inheritance how many know the
[1:53:19] inheritance not just coming down you're
[1:53:21] going to fight for what you know is
[1:53:23] yours
[1:53:25] i said again
[1:53:27] you're going to fight what has been
[1:53:29] revealed to you as yours
[1:53:34] that's different if it's not revealed to
[1:53:36] you you can't even claim it as yours
[1:53:38] but once it's revealed to you give me
[1:53:42] my mountain
[1:53:45] not david mountain not hebrew mountain
[1:53:47] not this one mountain my own
[1:53:50] because god said that among his minds
[1:53:52] and when the spirit focuses on what is
[1:53:54] yours you get locked in amen
[1:53:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:54:00] so therefore there's going to be some
[1:54:01] sons that are going to be adopted all
[1:54:03] right let's go quickly now now remember
[1:54:04] this from a guide
[1:54:06] these are the things that build a
[1:54:07] servant of christ
[1:54:09] for it first and virtue now remember
[1:54:11] here we go
[1:54:12] the holy spirit
[1:54:14] cannot cap the building of god until
[1:54:17] these things are operating by the spirit
[1:54:20] so these virtues have to be operated not
[1:54:23] by revelation well you know i brother
[1:54:25] come i i'll show you very kind of god
[1:54:27] bless you my brother know that
[1:54:29] all right that kind of make up thing
[1:54:31] that artificial thing we don't want
[1:54:33] artificial but other kinds that dry it
[1:54:34] up not for now depending upon who it is
[1:54:36] and what not that temporary buildings
[1:54:37] we're talking about operating by the
[1:54:39] spirit the spirit taking a hold of these
[1:54:41] virtues and bringing it alive
[1:54:44] so what could throw you in any situation
[1:54:46] anywhere
[1:54:47] in other words jesus busted his own
[1:54:49] disciples he said you have to have love
[1:54:50] more than the pharisees because them
[1:54:51] have loved their loved one bedroom too
[1:54:52] he said yeah the love who is not your
[1:54:54] own
[1:54:58] everybody is cool where they feel
[1:54:59] comfortable
[1:55:02] everybody is fine where they are
[1:55:04] comfortable but jesus said if you're in
[1:55:06] an uncomfortable situation you have to
[1:55:08] act right too
[1:55:09] you have to display it right also
[1:55:12] so for god to test you
[1:55:13] you know you had to get you outside the
[1:55:15] circle
[1:55:18] okay so no matter what you do these are
[1:55:20] the things that build the body of christ
[1:55:22] those things only long again but this is
[1:55:24] solid stuff first fate virtue knowledge
[1:55:27] is to be added until the company such a
[1:55:29] crisis is manifest then the holy spirit
[1:55:32] comes upon it and seizes one body
[1:55:35] ordination
[1:55:37] remember this morning lesson these
[1:55:38] virtues have to be in there before the
[1:55:40] caption will come on it
[1:55:42] you might shout you might speak in
[1:55:44] tongues that has nothing to do with it
[1:55:46] yeti bomb
[1:55:48] until these things are scripturally
[1:55:51] proven is sealed into you
[1:55:54] wait wait wait wait wait
[1:55:57] these things have to be scripturally
[1:55:59] proven
[1:56:03] so how google does it barely kindness by
[1:56:04] somebody who
[1:56:06] don't like you
[1:56:08] could do something to you
[1:56:10] in other words it has to come out
[1:56:11] automatically notice but the ram didn't
[1:56:13] ramp up something and said what should i
[1:56:15] do have a quote for that um
[1:56:17] that that you know no he couldn't ramp
[1:56:19] up that it had to come from inside of
[1:56:20] him he said i forgive you
[1:56:23] that came out of him
[1:56:25] it is not right
[1:56:27] okay now out to your faith virtue
[1:56:28] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:56:30] brotherly kindness your brother and his
[1:56:32] holy spirit and christ will come because
[1:56:35] just beneath him the holy spirit is the
[1:56:38] spirit of jesus christ into the church
[1:56:41] to manifest those virtues i pledge this
[1:56:44] morning to him with all my heart that by
[1:56:46] his help here we go and by his grace
[1:56:48] i pray i'll seek daily here we go church
[1:56:52] seek daily without ceasing until i feel
[1:56:56] every one of these requirements is
[1:56:58] fluent in this old statue of mind till i
[1:57:00] can be a manifestation of the living
[1:57:02] christ for he became sin like me that i
[1:57:04] might become righteous of god like him
[1:57:07] he took my place lord let me take his
[1:57:09] now because that's the purpose he died
[1:57:11] for how many people pledge that same
[1:57:13] thing by the grace this morning oh
[1:57:15] blessed be the name of the lord oh
[1:57:18] praise god so we are looking for the
[1:57:21] ministry of the spirit in ephesians that
[1:57:24] will come into ephesians to operate
[1:57:26] ephesians 4 11 a five-fold ministry that
[1:57:29] will bring the bride to perfection isn't
[1:57:31] that right because that is the bride's
[1:57:32] earthly goal to be a perfect man on the
[1:57:34] earth from border bannon paradox i've
[1:57:36] often wanted to come to church i've
[1:57:38] longed to see it where i could walk into
[1:57:40] the back door front door look across the
[1:57:41] audience and sin couldn't stay there the
[1:57:44] spirit would call it out it just
[1:57:46] couldn't stay like a nazi zafar you just
[1:57:48] couldn't do it there be no sin in that
[1:57:50] group no sir the spirit will quickly
[1:57:52] speak like that isn't that right it will
[1:57:55] be done woman and men coming on the
[1:57:56] power of the holy spirit the spirit of
[1:57:58] god moving perfectly if something gone
[1:58:00] wrong they will confess it before the
[1:58:02] spirit gotta hold it that's the church
[1:58:04] of the living god oh how my poor heart
[1:58:07] is getting old i've longed to stand to
[1:58:10] see a church like that i may yet i hope
[1:58:12] to perfect works of god without sin he
[1:58:16] looking for that he was expecting that
[1:58:18] and i believe with all my heart he's
[1:58:20] going to have that we're going to have
[1:58:21] that isn't that right jesus was the word
[1:58:23] isn't that right and the word was
[1:58:24] invisible until it was made flesh so now
[1:58:27] we're talking about the word and tapes
[1:58:29] the word on books that's just word word
[1:58:31] being spoken but that word have to come
[1:58:32] into your faith and your flesh and when
[1:58:35] the word become flesh it will become
[1:58:37] visible so no means like i have word
[1:58:40] made flesh and it's not visible it will
[1:58:42] become visible because the word conducts
[1:58:44] the spirit and the spirit will flow
[1:58:46] freely isn't that right
[1:58:48] god is ready if he's doing it now he's
[1:58:52] going to call a church to perfection by
[1:58:54] his word jesus christ
[1:58:56] if he's not doing it he will do it do
[1:58:58] what call a church of perfection oh
[1:59:01] hallelujah are you with me
[1:59:02] praise god blessed be the name of the
[1:59:05] lord you love him
[1:59:07] oh praise the name of the lord so the
[1:59:09] seed is back to its original condition
[1:59:12] it must have all the word to be the seed
[1:59:15] that's why sixties could make it it have
[1:59:17] to be all seven seals open it must be
[1:59:19] all the word to be received they can't
[1:59:21] united seven thunders because the
[1:59:23] seventh end has guided the bride the
[1:59:24] seven doesn't give the bright fate the
[1:59:26] seventh dimension about how we fear it
[1:59:28] must be all the world to be the seed so
[1:59:30] if they don't have all the word it's not
[1:59:32] the seed the prophet came to bring the
[1:59:34] seed from genesis all the way to
[1:59:36] revelation and that's the seed that's in
[1:59:38] you this morning oh glory to god do you
[1:59:40] believe that
[1:59:41] praise the name of the lord blessed be
[1:59:44] the name of the lord
[1:59:45] hallelujah hallelujah glory to the
[1:59:48] gospel brother okay so i believe okay
[1:59:52] okay hallelujah
[1:59:56] i believe in the baptism of holy ghost i
[1:59:58] believe in speaking in tongues he said
[1:59:59] you take a prisoner speak in tongues but
[2:00:01] enough timber to fight a bust so you
[2:00:03] talk about the holy ghost is meekness
[2:00:04] joy peace long suffering gentleness
[2:00:07] faith patience that's the fruit of the
[2:00:09] spirit humility if a brother is going
[2:00:11] wrong don't beat him or something go
[2:00:13] after him see if you can get him back
[2:00:15] don't wait for the preacher to do it you
[2:00:18] do it the preacher can't do it all
[2:00:20] neither can the deacons everybody is a
[2:00:22] member of this body of christ should go
[2:00:24] after one another we have got the spirit
[2:00:26] of christ he taught the great parable he
[2:00:28] left the 99 and went after one oh
[2:00:31] blessed be the name of the lord o praise
[2:00:33] god museum come up please oh hallelujah

[2:00:46] not restore the church it started
[2:00:48] reformation the wesleyan age didn't
[2:00:50] restore the pentecostal it didn't
[2:00:51] restore but god has to restore because
[2:00:54] he can't deny his word this is not the
[2:00:57] resurrection of the church it is the
[2:00:59] restoration of god god will take the
[2:01:02] church right back to pentecost at the
[2:01:04] beginning notice in verse 25 it tells
[2:01:07] why we need a restoration the locust the
[2:01:09] palm oil the caterpillar the palmer worm
[2:01:11] have eaten all but the root a little bit
[2:01:14] of the stem now we are told all these
[2:01:16] insects are one of the same stages
[2:01:18] that's right they are the antichrist
[2:01:20] spirit
[2:01:21] manifested in organization denomination
[2:01:24] and false doctrine through the ages and
[2:01:26] the paulo roots talk is going to be
[2:01:28] restored god isn't going to plant a new
[2:01:31] church but going to bring his original
[2:01:34] planting back to original seed he is
[2:01:36] doing it as stated in verse 23 by the
[2:01:39] teaching of marine
