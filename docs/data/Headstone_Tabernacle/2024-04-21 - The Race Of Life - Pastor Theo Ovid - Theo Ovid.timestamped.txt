[51:05] God bless you so this morning we have
[51:06] three portion of scripture i' like to
[51:08] read from Hebrews 12:1 and 2 1
[51:11] Corinthians chapter 9 ver 24- 27 2
[51:14] Timothy 4 7 to8 I like to read out all
[51:17] the scriptures because I like if I'm in
[51:19] a service and I have to write down the
[51:21] scriptures I could write them all down
[51:23] that's why I read out like that it's not
[51:24] that I expect you to find it the way I'm
[51:26] reading it but I'm reading it out in
[51:28] case you want to pin it down just a
[51:30] little testimony last Sunday we we
[51:32] announced that brother Solomon a was
[51:34] connected connected to us live from
[51:37] Ghana and um I called him next day and
[51:40] he gave me a powerful testimony there's
[51:42] a principal who I guess he had been
[51:44] sending things who is a Catholic and he
[51:46] happened to come that service that day
[51:48] now he said that there was a lot of rain
[51:50] in Ghana and that's why they switch a
[51:52] service about 1:00 so connect to our
[51:54] service here you know after that Serv
[51:56] was played the whole testimony
[51:58] everything else that that man came up
[52:00] and said if he don't give his life to
[52:02] Jesus now he'll go to hell and he asked
[52:05] to get baptized in Jesus name what a
[52:08] thing and you you know sometime people
[52:10] do things and it's just what God wants
[52:13] and God wanted that man to hear the
[52:16] testimony of sister Monica and the
[52:17] family and the whole service and
[52:20] everything else and him hearing him
[52:22] saying I'm going up yonder there's a
[52:23] real place now there's a real place up
[52:27] so reading from
[52:29] uh Hebrews 12 verse1 and 2 wherefore
[52:33] seeing we are compassed about with so
[52:36] great a cloud of witness says let us lay
[52:40] aside every weight and the sin which do
[52:42] so easily beset us let us run with
[52:45] patience the race that is set before us
[52:47] looking unto Jesus the UT finisher of
[52:50] our faith who for the joy that was set
[52:52] before him endured the cross despising
[52:56] the shame came and is sat down at the
[52:58] right hand of the Throne of God 1
[53:00] Corinthians chapter
[53:04] 9 verse
[53:07] 24 Paul
[53:09] speaks know ye not that they which run
[53:11] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[53:16] prize so run in other words the way you
[53:19] run all right there's a way to run so
[53:21] run that he may obtain and every man
[53:25] that striveth for the Mastery Hallelujah
[53:27] is temperate in all things now they do
[53:30] it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we
[53:33] an
[53:34] Incorruptible I therefore so run this is
[53:37] Paul speaking I therefore so run not as
[53:40] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[53:43] be to the air but I keep under my body
[53:46] and bring it in this objection least
[53:49] that by any means when I have preached
[53:51] to others I myself should be a cast away
[53:55] and second Timothy uh verse 4 and this
[53:59] is Paul again he's coming to the end of
[54:01] the road and and and um he's seing these
[54:06] words I have fought a good fight I have
[54:09] finished my course I have kept the faith
[54:13] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[54:16] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[54:18] the righteous judge shall give me at
[54:19] that day not only to me only but also
[54:22] all them that love is appearing may God
[54:24] bless his word let's pray one more time
[54:25] father God we thank you for your
[54:27] scriptures and may you come and
[54:28] interpret into our hearts bring life and
[54:30] and and and and power to your people in
[54:32] Jesus name I ask it amen you may be
[54:34] seated thank you again for coming out
[54:36] this morning and to hear and I pray that
[54:39] you be an active listener this morning
[54:41] that you would hear and receive and act
[54:42] upon the word of God so I have a title
[54:45] this morning the race of life that's the
[54:48] title I have the race of life and have
[54:50] an inspiration the race that is set
[54:54] before us
[54:56] are you
[54:58] ready amen you know this is not
[55:01] newspaper we're reading
[55:03] from this is not some fiction or some
[55:06] story book that you're reading from this
[55:09] is the Eternal Word of
[55:10] God God have no one else to express
[55:13] himself but by his word that's what make
[55:16] him God hallelujah that's why the Bible
[55:17] say the beginning was the word the word
[55:19] was with God and the Word was God for
[55:21] God to express it he has to use men
[55:24] that's why he called prophets that they
[55:26] could speak God's word and God's word
[55:29] can fail certain things God cannot do
[55:32] and certain God God could do one thing
[55:34] he can't do his lie so once it come out
[55:36] of his mouth it it got to come to pass
[55:39] the day you eat thereof that day you
[55:41] shall surely die God meant that and God
[55:44] kept his word and had to run the man he
[55:46] put in the Garden Eden out of Eden the
[55:49] same God that place them in even run
[55:51] them out Hallelujah and put a guard

[56:01] my presence he have to get out and don't
[56:03] touch that tree I love my sons I love my
[56:05] daughters but I give them the word and
[56:07] the word is God not your mother not your
[56:10] father the word is God not the pastor
[56:13] not the Elder the word is God not this
[56:15] church the word is God once you hear the
[56:17] word that's God speaking the word is God
[56:20] a lot of people have the god of their
[56:22] own imagination but the word is God you
[56:24] shall die in your s if you don't repent

[56:30] demands your repentance he demands your

[58:31] yonder for us the rain means different
[58:34] things let's
[58:36] continue eastes 9:11 speaks and says I
[58:41] returned and I saw Under the
[58:43] Sun that the race is not to the Swift
[58:47] nor the battle to the strong neither yet
[58:49] bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men
[58:52] of understanding nor yet favor to Men of
[58:54] skill but time and chance happened to
[58:56] them
[58:58] all
[59:00] time and
[59:02] chance that's part of this race time and
[59:07] chance according to where you're born
[59:09] where your family is where you're
[59:10] located time and chance may not have the
[59:13] schools you might want may not have the
[59:15] jobs what you want may not have the
[59:16] opportunities time and chance so be
[59:20] grateful I should have a bigger show
[59:22] than that because where you are is time
[59:25] and chance God place you there to give
[59:27] you your time and your
[59:29] chance you could have been in a terrible
[59:31] condition you could be elsewhere but
[59:33] time and chance giv the opportunity and
[59:35] however it worked out you got to hear
[59:37] the
[59:38] gospel that's the key
[59:41] there that's the key right there is not
[59:45] your dress and your tie and your your
[59:47] your your um um um um um glasses and and
[59:49] and and hat and and house and land and
[59:52] car that's irrelevant that have to do
[59:54] with the flesh but we talking about have
[59:56] to do with the soul this flesh could die
[59:59] but that soul that soul that inner man
[1:00:03] is what you have to prepare for Oh Glory
[1:00:06] to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:12] God hallelujah GL Paul said I have
[1:00:15] fought a good
[1:00:16] fight I have finished my
[1:00:19] course I've kept the
[1:00:21] feet but
[1:00:23] Bram he's talking about the angel was
[1:00:26] coming to him he said don't remember
[1:00:28] something is fixing to happen I don't
[1:00:31] know what it is but could it be this the
[1:00:34] reason I say this prepare yourselves am
[1:00:37] let us pray take our position in the
[1:00:40] army of his Believers and prepare
[1:00:43] ourselves for it may be later than we
[1:00:46] are thinking note he didn't say go to
[1:00:49] church
[1:00:51] sir let's go let's go granular now he
[1:00:54] didn't say go to church he said
[1:00:56] prepare yourself is that a scriptural
[1:00:59] order or not that's a scriptural order
[1:01:02] because the Bible said his
[1:01:04] wife had made herself shout out ready
[1:01:07] shout out ready not the pastor made them
[1:01:11] ready no his wife had made herself ready
[1:01:15] so every time you come to service
[1:01:17] there's a word that you could clothe
[1:01:19] yourself with there's a word that you
[1:01:21] could act upon there's a word that you
[1:01:24] can obey
[1:01:27] Hallelujah in your obedience to God you
[1:01:30] show you're a
[1:01:31] Christian not coming to church coming to
[1:01:34] church you're religious when you start
[1:01:35] to obey the word you become a Christian
[1:01:38] oh give the Lord a shout people like
[1:01:41] religion they like the covering they
[1:01:43] like to come to church because they have
[1:01:45] a spirit upon them to come to church but
[1:01:48] we not talking about coming to church we
[1:01:49] talking about you come in obedience to
[1:01:51] the word of
[1:01:52] God oh give the Lord I shout
[1:01:59] Amen brother
[1:02:00] Lon it may be the end
[1:02:03] time it may be time for the rainbows to
[1:02:06] sweep across the sky and I knock from
[1:02:08] Heaven saying time is no
[1:02:10] more if it is let's prepare ourselves
[1:02:14] friend to meet our
[1:02:17] God there's plenty of food lay in now

[1:10:35] share they don't want to share they're
[1:10:36] mean and greedy too with it and they run
[1:10:39] at the end it I was tell man about

[1:10:44] eight
[1:10:46] people that's sad that's some people

[1:10:51] people because they affected lives to
[1:10:55] change lives oh my Hallelujah the
[1:11:00] greatest thing you could do is to live
[1:11:01] for
[1:11:02] others to be mean and selfish and
[1:11:05] unwilling and not serving is a terrible
[1:11:08] thing all right here we go here where I
[1:11:10] going to get you
[1:11:12] now so that's the way God does he takes
[1:11:14] the gold that he has F on the earth and
[1:11:16] he beats it by the Holy Spirit turns it
[1:11:18] over and over and beaten it until he can
[1:11:21] see his
[1:11:22] reflection and that what he's supposed
[1:11:24] to do reflect the Son of God here we go
[1:11:27] there's the part now so many of us try
[1:11:30] to do the works of Christ before the
[1:11:34] reflection of Christ in us now there is
[1:11:36] the trouble we find those things
[1:11:39] happening you know I know it we see
[1:11:41] stumbles along the world we find here we
[1:11:45] go the scrap peap of
[1:11:48] Ministers of Christians piled along the
[1:11:52] road is because they didn't go into it
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] so if you don't go right you end up a
[1:11:59] scrap
[1:12:00] peep you know how the trucks pass around
[1:12:03] buying scrap
[1:12:06] metal old battery
[1:12:09] buying buying scrap metal it had a truck
[1:12:12] I saw the truck going I said but he
[1:12:13] should be a scrap
[1:12:14] metal one old truck looking to buy they
[1:12:18] should that truck should be put another
[1:12:20] truck
[1:12:25] don't want you to be like
[1:12:27] that a scrap
[1:12:30] PE she was a Christian Lord look at she
[1:12:34] now he was a Christian he's a church man
[1:12:37] but look where
[1:12:41] he what is a
[1:12:44] course a race course or a running track
[1:12:48] is a route where races or horse races or
[1:12:51] human races motor races take place these
[1:12:55] these courses are designed to provide a
[1:12:58] fair and challenging environment for
[1:13:01] competitors and a typically marks with a
[1:13:05] starting and finishing
[1:13:07] points as well as various checkpoints or
[1:13:11] obstacles depending upon the type of
[1:13:15] race to finish one's course finish the
[1:13:19] course is usually or generally to
[1:13:22] complete a journey a task a course in
[1:13:25] education training a specific project
[1:13:29] finishing one's course in life implies
[1:13:31] completing various
[1:13:33] stages and
[1:13:35] challenges and responsibilities that
[1:13:37] comes with it amen it consists it can it
[1:13:42] can be a point on reaching one's goal
[1:13:45] fulfilling your
[1:13:46] responsibility like how the Bible talk
[1:13:48] about shall this shall a man leave his
[1:13:50] mother and father and cleave unto his
[1:13:52] wife when parenting is fully
[1:13:54] accomplished you have mature individuals
[1:13:56] in the home that could make life's
[1:13:58] decision and take on and take on their
[1:14:01] own life's journey and so on when the
[1:14:03] children are smaller finishing the
[1:14:05] course means getting them a full
[1:14:06] education being dear for them when they
[1:14:09] need you because there's always somebody
[1:14:11] that will want to guide them and if you
[1:14:14] don't guide somebody else will guide
[1:14:17] that's how the devil does it so the what
[1:14:19] they want and the children need is Godly
[1:14:22] Parents and
[1:14:23] godly parents and so on in them isn't
[1:14:25] that right but these courses all these
[1:14:28] courses are individuals you have people
[1:14:30] who learn at their own pace some people
[1:14:32] learn faster on others and so like that
[1:14:34] so it's not a general course we running
[1:14:36] the course is not a we race in we in the
[1:14:40] race is individuals running in the race
[1:14:43] do you get that now so your race is
[1:14:46] customized for you your cost is set for
[1:14:50] you you can't run somebody else race you
[1:14:54] set you are running the race and the
[1:14:56] course God has precept for
[1:14:58] you glory to God based upon your
[1:15:02] abilities and your circumstance and so
[1:15:05] on so I have here a few type of ways
[1:15:09] people run race some people run
[1:15:11] fast some people run steady right some
[1:15:15] people run slow some people run
[1:15:19] focused some people the focus are
[1:15:21] they're disciplined and committed to
[1:15:23] stay on track am C to them off you to
[1:15:26] see it as students you see these slack
[1:15:29] students and the teachers here will know
[1:15:30] what I'm talking about you'll see the
[1:15:32] comedians in the class because they not
[1:15:34] learning anything the cracking jokes
[1:15:35] just to distract and something like that
[1:15:37] they affect the whole class when they
[1:15:38] out of it the whole class settled and so
[1:15:41] like that some people are focused some
[1:15:43] people are
[1:15:45] distracted easily distracted from their
[1:15:48] race
[1:15:49] course there are some people that are
[1:15:52] focused and they are discipline
[1:15:54] committed to stay on track we have we
[1:15:56] get that some people are
[1:15:58] competitive they only trying to
[1:16:00] outperform others and reach ahead of the
[1:16:04] pack some are
[1:16:06] directionless without a clear sense of
[1:16:09] direction or purpose feeling lost or
[1:16:13] uncertain about their goals even now uh
[1:16:17] my grandchildren 9 years old they have
[1:16:19] um car A Day In My Time had nothing like
[1:16:22] that and they're getting the children to
[1:16:25] be aware of career paths career
[1:16:27] opportunities and you seeing the
[1:16:29] children dressing like what they want to
[1:16:30] be I saw one of them 9-year-old dressing
[1:16:33] like a a Hostess equip it with he pull a
[1:16:35] long
[1:16:36] back so firemen doctors the people have
[1:16:39] long thing and everything else and
[1:16:42] everybody have the so what I'm saying
[1:16:43] then because what what they want they
[1:16:45] want the children at an early age to get
[1:16:47] a vision because Vision give you a sense
[1:16:49] of purpose we preach that that's only
[1:16:51] Bible you have no vision without the
[1:16:53] vision the people without the vision
[1:16:55] people they perish because there is no
[1:16:57] vision with no vision there's no target
[1:16:59] with no target there's no goal there's
[1:17:01] no purpose there's no
[1:17:03] drive like you're smoking ganja then
[1:17:05] you're weeding weed
[1:17:08] side you you're weeding away getting
[1:17:11] head because there is no drive or no
[1:17:15] purpose because once you find purpose
[1:17:18] you get to pick up everybody just trying
[1:17:21] to shake you off that purpose cuz once
[1:17:23] they get purpose and vision watch them
[1:17:25] Devils come watch Friends come watch
[1:17:27] family come to upset to distract to get
[1:17:30] you off the channel and the line that
[1:17:32] God put you
[1:17:33] on Oh Glory to God if I was listening to
[1:17:36] my family i' never be here this morning
[1:17:38] if I was listen to my family I never get
[1:17:40] baptized in Jesus name I heard from God
[1:17:42] oh glory to God you have to hear from
[1:17:44] God yourself your father can't make that
[1:17:47] for you your mother can't make that from
[1:17:49] you not even your husband or wife could
[1:17:51] do that for you you got to hear from God
[1:17:53] yourself when you hear from God that's
[1:17:55] the voice of God to you that's a rock
[1:17:58] that's a revelation that's a anchor in
[1:18:00] your soul Oh Glory to God you need that
[1:18:04] if you don't have it ask God for that
[1:18:06] this
[1:18:13] morning there's some people run this
[1:18:15] race
[1:18:18] responsible prioritizing
[1:18:20] accountability and ethical
[1:18:23] Behavior First Timothy
[1:18:27] 6 6- 12 says but godliness with
[1:18:32] contentment is great gain listen to
[1:18:35] these
[1:18:36] words for we brought nothing into this
[1:18:40] world that's the beginning of the race
[1:18:43] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[1:18:48] out I was telling about a Channel about
[1:18:51] smartw
[1:18:52] watch counting steps
[1:18:56] heart rate be read Bush he he never
[1:18:59] bought one he never had one he don't
[1:19:00] need that where he going
[1:19:03] now so what I was telling him about he
[1:19:05] doesn't need
[1:19:08] that he does need walk around his
[1:19:10] Savannah and touching to and exercise
[1:19:12] him because he want to live
[1:19:15] long he has gone to where there's no old
[1:19:18] age there no tiredness there hallelujah
[1:19:23] oh my my
[1:19:26] sometimes you feel to go sometimes look
[1:19:31] at because this world is
[1:19:34] terrible but we are here for a
[1:19:37] witness to prove that Jesus Christ is
[1:19:41] the same yesterday today and
[1:19:44] forever
[1:19:46] Hallelujah we brought nothing into this
[1:19:48] world verse 7 and it is certain we can
[1:19:51] carry nothing out having food and rment
[1:19:53] let us therefore be
[1:19:55] content but they that will be rich fall
[1:19:59] into temptation and a snear and into
[1:20:01] many foolish and hurtful lust which Dr
[1:20:04] men in destruction and
[1:20:07] predition not money is the root of all
[1:20:11] evil For the Love of
[1:20:13] Money That's Right is the root of all
[1:20:16] evil which while some coveted after they
[1:20:20] have heard from the Fate why because
[1:20:23] they have their own internal lust so
[1:20:26] their lust make them ear in the fate and
[1:20:28] they still come to church but they allow
[1:20:31] lust and sometime God has give you what
[1:20:33] you have in your
[1:20:35] heart why some people love false
[1:20:37] teachers because they're false on the
[1:20:39] inside and they like the Mysteries and
[1:20:41] the revelations these men bringing and
[1:20:43] men they know the man fals but they love
[1:20:47] what he is saying they love how it has
[1:20:50] come W I never see it
[1:20:53] so what did the Bible say say what did
[1:20:56] the word say all right but thou oh man
[1:20:59] of God this I want to get to now flee
[1:21:02] these
[1:21:05] things flee and follow after what follow
[1:21:09] after
[1:21:10] righteousness
[1:21:11] godliness Faith love patience meekness
[1:21:17] it means you're looking and you're
[1:21:19] following after it you're walking after
[1:21:21] it you not say it coming it coming no
[1:21:23] follow it
[1:21:25] run from that and follow this flee from
[1:21:28] that and follow this you have to flee
[1:21:30] and
[1:21:32] follow when you get rid of stuff you
[1:21:34] have to get other stuff to replace what
[1:21:36] you're getting rid of it's not good
[1:21:39] enough it's not good enough just to get
[1:21:40] rid of you have to get something in his
[1:21:42] place he said flee that and follow that
[1:21:45] flee that certain things have to run
[1:21:47] from certain friends you have to delete
[1:21:49] over your
[1:21:50] phone because they going to destroy you
[1:21:54] oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:21:56] certain people you need to cut off you
[1:21:58] need to cut them off all together have
[1:22:01] no fellowship with
[1:22:02] Darkness Hallelujah have no fellowship
[1:22:05] with corruption you need to do that
[1:22:08] because a rotten apple will spoil the
[1:22:09] rest of apples oh give the Lord some
[1:22:13] Praises you can't convert them they will

[1:22:42] cloud of

[1:22:46] now part of that
[1:22:48] cloud the Witnesses in is Hebrews 11
[1:22:51] they spoted that cloud all them
[1:22:53] champions of faith and maybe they're
[1:22:55] looking over the bananes of time and I
[1:22:57] could see if they could speak to us they
[1:22:58] would say come on they can make it man

[1:23:44] the faith in other words I have kept the
[1:23:45] rules of this game oh give the Lord some

[2:15:21] that is Hebrews 2 verse 9 but we see
[2:15:24] Jesus who was made a little ler than the
[2:15:27] angels for the suffering of death
[2:15:31] purpose he couldn't die as an angel he
[2:15:33] was made lower to become man for the
[2:15:36] suffering of death crowned with Glory
[2:15:39] and Honor that he by the grace of God
[2:15:42] should taste death for every man for it
[2:15:45] what for it became him for whom are all
[2:15:48] things and by whom are all things in
[2:15:52] bringing many sons into glory to make
[2:15:56] here we go the captain of their
[2:15:59] salvation perfect through
[2:16:02] suffering for both he that sanctifieth
[2:16:06] and they who are Sanctified are all one
[2:16:10] for which cause he's not ashamed to call
[2:16:12] them Brethren oh my so it says here he
[2:16:17] Amplified for it was an act worthy of
[2:16:20] God verse 10 and fitting to the divine
[2:16:22] nature that he for whose sake and by
[2:16:25] whom all things have have an existence
[2:16:28] in bringing many sons into Glory should
[2:16:30] make the pioneer of the Salvation
[2:16:32] perfect should bring to maturity The
[2:16:37] Human Experience necessary to be
[2:16:40] perfectly equipped for his office as
[2:16:42] high priest Hallelujah true suffering oh
[2:16:45] that's beautiful in other words Jesus
[2:16:49] experienced death experience suffering
[2:16:52] that he could be that perfect high
[2:16:54] priest that can be touched by the
[2:16:57] feeling of
[2:16:59] infirmities so he knows what you go
[2:17:01] through he knows your suffering he knows
[2:17:04] your pain and he can make proper
[2:17:06] intercession on your behalf oh give the
[2:17:08] Lord some
[2:17:09] Praises Bible said he learn obedience by
[2:17:12] the things that he suffered Oh Glory to

[2:17:17] rights but he suffered he give up his
[2:17:19] rights he learned obedience hallah
[2:17:22] Hallelujah so he became perfect through
[2:17:25] suffering to finish this work that he
[2:17:28] could be that high priest isn't that
[2:17:30] right through that suffering he could
[2:17:32] come to that maturity and he said it in
[2:17:35] Luke 13 verse 32 he said go and tell
[2:17:39] that fox talking about the behold I cast
[2:17:42] out devils and I do cures today and
[2:17:44] tomorrow and the third day I shall be
[2:17:46] perfected amen and the Amplified Luke
[2:17:50] 133 says he said to them go and tell
[2:17:52] that fox Sly and crafty skulking and
[2:17:54] cowardly behold I drive out demons and
[2:17:57] perform healings today and tomorrow and
[2:17:59] on the third day I finish or complete my
[2:18:01] course so Jesus Knew by the
[2:18:04] identification of the three gifts to
[2:18:07] wise men brought of gold frankinson and
[2:18:09] myrrh God in service to die he knew his
[2:18:12] course finished at death paying the
[2:18:15] price not only to become high priest but
[2:18:17] to get the book to loose your name

[2:18:34] parted in the book Oh Glory to God he
[2:18:37] released your name that you cannot be
[2:18:40] deceived because the devil deceive all
[2:18:42] except whose name's written so there has
[2:18:45] to be a means that your name could be
[2:18:47] identified oh give the Lord a shout in

[2:18:54] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:18:58] so he had was to go through this Human
[2:19:01] Experience so now we come to a great
[2:19:04] cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 12 oh
[2:19:07] praise God all the way all the saints
[2:19:10] was going on before making up that cloud
[2:19:12] who have ran their race in life and
[2:19:14] their race is over and they make out the
[2:19:16] cloud of witnesses of Barack and Gideon
[2:19:18] and Samson and Jeffy and William
[2:19:20] brandham and all the Saints have G on
[2:19:21] before making out this CL of witnesses
[2:19:24] and he saying come on come on come on
[2:19:25] come on come on you can make it amen God
[2:19:28] hallelujah praise God because Hebrews
[2:19:30] 13:14 for here we have no continuing
[2:19:32] City but we seek one to come glory to
[2:19:35] God hallelujah there's no paying
[2:19:37] mortgage there there's no bills over
[2:19:39] there oh there's no sickness there
[2:19:41] there's no wheelchair there there's no
[2:19:43] blind there there's no death and dumb
[2:19:45] there there's no there there's
[2:19:47] no depression there and frustration
[2:19:49] there and you can't take get there they
[2:19:51] don't have that over there oh glory to
[2:19:53] God what a time is going to be so we
[2:19:56] only passing here to have this Human
[2:19:58] Experience on this Earth we passing
[2:20:00] through to be a testimony here we have
[2:20:03] no continuing City but we seeking a city
[2:20:05] who make and bilder of God glory to God
[2:20:08] hallelujah glory to God oh yes Lord give
[2:20:11] him some
[2:20:14] [Applause]
[2:20:15] Praises I'll be honest with you today I
[2:20:18] have 21 pages and now reach 12 all right
[2:20:21] so we see how it goes I wouldn't worry
[2:20:23] out 2 Timothy 2 verse 5 very important
[2:20:27] scripture if a man also strive for
[2:20:31] masteries yet he is not crowned except
[2:20:36] he strive
[2:20:38] lawfully Amplified says if anyone enters
[2:20:41] competitive games he's not crowned
[2:20:43] unless he completes lawfully fairly
[2:20:46] according to the rules laid down so this
[2:20:50] analogy
[2:20:51] of race is clean and clear in the
[2:20:54] scriptures just like a natural race am
[2:20:56] if you don't run correctly you'll be
[2:20:59] disqualified so don't bother with all
[2:21:01] who hustling to be this and that and
[2:21:03] they claiming adoption claiming this and
[2:21:04] claiming all kind of thing let them
[2:21:05] claim B with that like a brother tell me
[2:21:07] you know he ahead of me I say brother
[2:21:09] I'm I'm I'm running as fast as I could
[2:21:12] I'm going to get there I'm going to get
[2:21:13] there I know you're
[2:21:18] ahead so if I Runner makes a shortcut
[2:21:21] cut to the
[2:21:22] field he be
[2:21:25] disqualified he get Applause because
[2:21:27] people think he really come true
[2:21:29] especially long distance race walk on
[2:21:30] the hills and two valleys and all kind
[2:21:32] of thing like that and he might take a
[2:21:33] shortcut and the see boy coming
[2:21:36] come Hallelujah next minute when they
[2:21:39] run the
[2:21:40] cameras Hallelujah you thought didn't

[2:22:47] got to play the game according to the
[2:22:49] rules we have got to run with patience

[2:22:57] Enoch by faith the great Heroes of Faith
[2:22:59] seeing we are com about with such great
[2:23:01] Witnesses here we are tonight right in

[2:31:18] closing 1 Corinthians 6
[2:31:20] 69 says know ye not that the unrighteous
[2:31:24] shall not inherit the kingdom of God be
[2:31:27] not deceived M please neither
[2:31:30] fornicators idolators nor adulterers nor
[2:31:33] effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[2:31:35] with mankind no thieves no coverers no
[2:31:39] drunkards no revilers no extortioners
[2:31:43] shall inherit the kingdom of
[2:31:45] God so all these sins listed here
[2:31:50] Hallelujah eminate Abus of mankinds
[2:31:54] sexual immorality adultery tough greed
[2:31:57] drunkness slander stating all those who
[2:32:01] practice these things shall not inherit
[2:32:03] the
[2:32:04] kingdom of
[2:32:06] God Galatians 1 6 tonight I Marvel Paul
[2:32:10] said that you saw remove it from him
[2:32:13] that called
[2:32:14] you unto the grace of Christ unto
[2:32:17] another gospel which is not another but
[2:32:20] there is some that trouble you that
[2:32:23] would pervert the gospel of Christ this
[2:32:25] perversion of the word is still since in
[2:32:28] Bible times but though we Anchor Point
[2:32:32] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[2:32:34] gospel unto you than which have preached
[2:32:37] unto you let him be a cursed and as we
[2:32:41] said before so say I now again if any
[2:32:44] man preach any other gospel unto you
[2:32:46] than you have received let him be a
[2:32:48] cursed
[2:32:50] all these things are
[2:32:52] hindrances from that race that God
[2:32:54] called it to
[2:32:56] Rus 1 John 2 15 and 17 love not the
[2:33:00] world neither the things that are in the
[2:33:02] world if any man Lov the world the love
[2:33:06] of the father is not in him that is
[2:33:08] final you can love the world and love
[2:33:10] the father too let's read it again love
[2:33:13] not the world neither the things that
[2:33:14] are in the world if any man love the
[2:33:16] world the love the father not in him for
[2:33:18] all that is in in the world lust of the
[2:33:21] flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life
[2:33:24] is not of the father but is of the world
[2:33:28] so we are warned against love in the
[2:33:30] world oh praise the name of the Lord we
[2:33:32] are warned just about two or three more
[2:33:35] Disobedience 1st Samuel
[2:33:39] 15:22 and Samuel said hath the Lord as
[2:33:42] great Delight in burnt offerings and
[2:33:43] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[2:33:45] the Lord behold to obey it is better
[2:33:47] than sacrifice than to happen to the fat
[2:33:50] of rams what God want from us all of us
[2:33:52] is
[2:33:53] obedience a lot of people hearing you
[2:33:56] know but not obeying I'm going to
[2:33:58] close I'm 19 of
[2:34:01] 21 Luke 189 to4 he speak a parable two
[2:34:06] men went up in the temple to pray one
[2:34:08] Pharisee one Publican the Pharisees
[2:34:11] stood and prayed thus with himself God I
[2:34:14] thank Thee I am not as the other men are
[2:34:17] extortioners and unjust and adulterers
[2:34:20] and even as this Publican and I fast
[2:34:22] twice in the week I give my tights of
[2:34:24] all that I possess and the Publican
[2:34:26] standing a far off would not lift up as
[2:34:28] much as his eyes Under heaven but smoted
[2:34:30] his breath and saying God be merciful to
[2:34:32] me a sinner I tell you this man went
[2:34:36] down to his house Justified rather than
[2:34:39] the other for everyone that exalted
[2:34:41] himself shall be a beast and he that
[2:34:44] humble himself shall be exalted
[2:34:47] Pride on this
[2:34:52] last one I'm going to close with this
[2:34:54] play something softly from Hebrews 5
[2:34:56] reading from verse 12 for when for the
[2:34:59] time you ought to be teachers you have
[2:35:02] need that one teach you again which be
[2:35:05] the first principles of the Oracles of
[2:35:07] God and I become as such need of milk
[2:35:09] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[2:35:12] usth milk is unskillful in the world of
[2:35:13] righteousness for he's a bab but strong
[2:35:17] meat belongeth to them that are full age
[2:35:20] even those by reason who have used of
[2:35:22] their senses exercise to discern but
[2:35:24] good and evil so there
[2:35:26] is a real danger in staying spiritually
