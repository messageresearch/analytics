we're so good to be here tonight and um we have one per request for one mrs flanders philip she's suffering with a female condition please pray for healing and for deliverance this ball hits as we want to ask god hand on this case tonight heavenly father we thank you for your presence and for this gathering tonight lord and we pray that you would come along in a special way and we commit mrs flanders philip into your hands with his female condition father may she be healed and may she be delivered if she doesn't know you and you're saving grace we should come to knowing that save in greece granted lord and jesus may ask it amen and amen god bless you church and it's good to be here and tonight i'll be sharing something with you and i trust it would be an encouragement and help to you i trust that you were encouraged by sunday's service uh marked by god or marked by the beast goddess about isaac you made it in he had a hectic day today and we're looking forward to hearing from him sharing more of that great stuff that he shares and um you know it's an amazing time that we're living in a very stressful time a great time uh the bible talk about a time of trouble that is yet to come and we have our own troubles to deal with our own challenges that you deal with so in time like these the scriptures and the word of god becomes a great encouragement because we don't belong to this modern society where anything goes we have our solid foundation on the scriptures and that is where our feet is based on you know as america head towards this critical election and i want to share with you that god is neither democrat or republican god is the word so it's a matter of which is unless of two evils but this it is what it is and we know america is moving into its place in prophecy and if america is moving into its place in prophecy where the bible speaks about it was it it was born as a lamb and which speaks like a dragon the whole tone and and way that we know of america will change it has to change and it's amazing how the church world is so caught up in politics in america and this is also prophesied this is all have to be because at the behind everything there's a roman spirit we talk about spirit now spirit is a roman spirit that is the behind the scenes then so whatever you see in front behind that is the spirit of rome that mother hallett that god one day say that she will destroy so i want you to know tonight that we are going headlong into prophecy we'll be fools and we'll be like going on in a basement and saying there is no light if we try to blind our eyes on the reality that we are living in the times or the clues and times of the gentiles and it's up to each one of us to make our call in an election show it's up to each one of us to really take time out to seek the lord and ask god for your portion ask for your inheritance ask god for your word and i trust tonight that what we share would would help you and encourage you that is not just uh uh uh other like an easy floating thing back it's not it's not gonna be like that we're gonna find out from the wood tonight so tonight each of your bibles i'd like you to turn to two portion scriptures tonight one from a familiar one luke 16 16 and philippians chapter 3 verse 7 to 14. that is the two scriptures we read tonight luke 16 16 and it reads the law and the prophets wanted john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presses into it and philippians 3 7-14 this is paul but what things were gained to me those i counted those i counted lost for christ ye doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do condemn but dawn that i may gain christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is true the fate of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either will already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i'm apprehended of christ jesus brethren i can't not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus this boy has one more time father we thank you for your word we have read it lord and then you inspire the this whole teaching and what we share tonight that our lives i'm having children in jesus name i asked amen god bless you praise god and this scripture i want to get down to this verse here in the amplified and paul was saying in verse 12 this is amplified not that i have not attained this ideal or have already been made perfect but i press on only hold of grasp and make my own that for which christ jesus the messiah has laid hold of me and made me his own i do not consider brethren that i have captured and make it my own yet but one thing i do it is my one aspiration forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on towards the goal to win the supreme and heavenly prize to which god in christ jesus is calling us upward so tonight i have a title i like to give it i press towards the mark straining forward to what lies ahead now nobody like to stream people like to it things will work out you have your certain expectation and and because of your expectation when it doesn't work out according to your expectation you get disappointed a disappointment and your disappointment is a difference between what is your expectation and what is the manifestation and sometimes you have to ask yourself do you ask yourself what is god's expectation you know when we know that if it doesn't work out as we expect that god will work all things for good to them that love him and if we love him he could just want he's just going to work things out no i don't want the songs scattered scattered tonight but there's some things that upon my heart and i will say like isaac we'll have a conversation tonight something that i don't get to do i'll be honest preaching and everything else but we could have a conversation tonight because i was thinking tonight uh what to share with you and i was thinking about the bible talk about that god bless and elijah and until the restitution of all things in other words he lies the last spirit will come and there'll be a restoration of all things so the prophecy hanging over us is to literally see a restoration of what they had in the beginning which is that book of acts which is that they are pentecost that we spoke about that is our target our goal that is our mark that we have to get back to and um we have to be able to say this this scripture is fulfilled that is what prophesied of the prophet's message that our hearts will be turned back literally back to the feet of the fathers so all this church thing this is not the promise then the promise is not the church the church building uh the arrangement of the church church the real church is a mystery that real church is a mystery and that mystery really is the body of christ what we have is fellowship a building a place where we gather together shake one of our hands well not no not no that was before this is pandemic but the the thing about it the real church is the body of christ and that body of christ is a mystery and to get into that body you have to be baptized with the holy ghost this is what this is all about being baptized into the body and in that body have access to all the other blessings that god have in store for his people but be it as it is me where we are at right now go send a prophet to reveal the old plan of god the first thing that god has to deal with is the sin question the question of your past the question of your behavior of your attitude and one thing was striking me it cannot be by works that we get blessed it has to be by faith by grace this is how god set it up and it ties in with the jubilee that the jubilee was only because somebody couldn't pay themselves they couldn't redeem themselves and god put that that space inside the deer to make a provision for deliverance and favoritism and you have to accept what god say about you the problem today is we are hearing but we are not saying like paul we want we want it to be as our own we want this bible to be as our own we want the word spoken to be as our own we have to claim it as our very own i forget the things that are passed and if you could get that right tonight forget your past you come through so much of stuff and sometimes your mind is twisted your spirit is twisted and messed up and the only thing he could rest back on really is what god has said because you yourself will find yourself as a failure failure as a father as a brother as a mother as a wife as a husband you have not come up to mark not because you're a bad person there's no school of parenting there was no school of how to be a great husband not to be a great wife we do the best that we can and we we press on in god but the reality is uh we have more to learn and paul was saying i have no righteousness on my own and yet he was a pharisee and yet he was a big serious person a righteous man and he come to allah there's nothing because he wants to learn christ and the thing of it is many times we want something but we don't want to let go the past we want what's ahead but we don't want to give up what we have and and i'm afraid it can't work that way you can't have a good ways if you want to move forward you have to leave what is behind you but more than that i don't just be pressing as a terminology i press it are you going a long time people ask you oh you're going suppress it no no i want to see press in a different way tonight a wonderc press as has been able to go beyond and strain towards this is what i'm trying to get to you you see with all this training with all the pushing you're just dear you know you know you're supposed to go forward but there is no active participation and you know lord thank you for your blessing but there's no person really there's there is um a kind of liturgy a sluggishness a laziness if i could be roughing it up tonight this is the past any house tonight having a conversation but when when it comes to strain into what is before like the title we give tonight straining to what let me see together tonight i pressed was the marks training forward towards lies ahead that is why i'm so troubled when people see this past already and that pass already and like if we adopted and everything is fine we're just waiting on on uh when he press come down to what she took building i don't want the price to come down to washington told them i want to know what i have now i want when goliath come i am eat no beer i am meat no lion faith comes by experience not just by revelation you have to have an experience to have faith you know it come like if you never sell something before you never say you want to buy you never sell something before the first they try to sell something you have so much a news and everything else because you don't you don't have the experience but when when you sell one item two items three items ten items you're are salesman you know to talk to people because you have the experience so this is the whole thing about it church we have been sitting in services for many years we are about to get some experiences hallelujah you are about to get some experiences i could tell you think it's not strange and you know the rest of the scripture of the fiery trials take it that's strange that the hopes are hell is against you listen listen the devil have all all all all all dwell on you take any immaculate except those who names already and if your name is written hallelujah if your name is written you you have to press you can't help it it's a behavior inside of you there is no giving up there is no letting go one of the things you have to press past for sure is frustration because frustration when you're frustrated you can't see the right pictures because you your mind dizzy your your days you're frustrated you're fed up you can't take it no more you can't talk like that we're having a conversation i i the bible teacher come in don't worry next you can get some goodbye with teaching stuff but um we have a conversation tonight i have things to share with you and i want to share with you because i want you to see i pressure was the mark not just in the context of the scripture written here but i want to see a person towards the mark of god i want you to see yourself present towards a mark as a goal i want you to see the presence was a mark of achievement and you should have goals and have markers and have ambition and have where you want to be and where you want to go just like the prophet said live like jesus christ coming tomorrow but the plan like if you come in uh like plan you make your plans 20 years 10 years you make your plans and the reason i'm seeing that is that without marks without goals without targets we just go into the motion what a mark does a mark could identify how you have progressed this is what mac does this is what achievement does and just as in the phone world that flip phone that have all them things are making circle stand up and phone boot you don't see those things no more when you stop in full moon and put your coin because somebody said this can't work this car continues like that nobody stands in front of any boot to put in any coin that's cell phone and after cell phone now he was just calling and whatnot then they say no we need more we need a glass we need we need to see we need video we need that communication thing what are they doing they keep improving they keep adding and this is why we could do what we do right now in this virtual room because somebody is thinking ahead they're going forward in the spiritual realm we have to move forward in the same manner with steps goals mark you just say at your feet virtue and the virtual knowledge and temperance it's maxed and peter said uh uh um what we said giving all diligence so it's not a matter of but you know what i mean is the virtues and you go work out hallelujah glory no no no given all diligence add two it means you have to put something layer on top a layer step upon step this is how you get a building this how companies make profits this is how businessman go forward from station station and step to step failure doesn't mean to stop let me let me repeat that failure doesn't mean to stop if you're feeling you feel forward don't feel backward feel moving forward feel walking towards jesus hallelujah as he walks on the water fail but you're failing going forward you're not going to be arrested on pause you're going to push the press push to achieve we want to achieve a revival we know revival means that kind of being a revival the people have living a revival but but you yourself have to see yourself worthy of this revival or or part of this revival or creating this revival and buddha made the prayer lord make me a revival create the revival in me i want you tonight to be able to say these words i press towards the mark strain into what is a hell i want you to be able to speak for yourself what you pressing on to what you're pushing onto and don't look to the left or look to the right get into the word get into this study your brain talk about elijah and jehu and and one of the lessons that really touched me a lot was the jehu uh teaching because it shows the judgment of god when that begins to ride nothing will stop it whatever god said will happen when brother branham saw the vision of america being destroyed under the structure that is already passed and let me as i said has already passed let me read the scripture for you centrist in scripture is from ecclesiastes chapter 3 and it's verse 13 to 14. if you want to find it or you want to take a note of it ecliesis chapter 3 verse 13 to 14 and it says and also that every man should eat and drink well let me find that i wanted this whole one second praise the lord declares chapter 3 okay who is 14 and 15 right not 18 14. i know that whatsoever god do it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it no anything taken from it and god do it that men should fear before him that which had been is now that which is to be had already been and god required that which is passed and amplified said that which is now already has been that which is to be already has been and god seeks that which has passed by so that history repeats itself and you know what god said about this message okay i mean what god required of us is pentecost that already passed they already got the holy ghost he already were adopted a doctor's adoption of nothing is nothing foreign is because both and the angel met him and because the angel met him 1946 he introduced the age of adoption because we had the long period of pentecost and god has to climax that with the manifestation of the reveal of the son of man and the son of man is the manifestation that brings seed let me say it again the son of man is who brings seed he's his soul and every time you son of man come you have to look for a manifestation of spirit after son of man because after son of man you see son of god this is what happened in jesus name he came son of man as the god prophet himself and he brought seed and he keeps seeding on these men who were frail who were backslidden who was in conditions who was in different situations carnal men natural men and he had to tell them and teach them and share with them things of this kingdom they were not aware of that they were born just like you and i in sin shaping iniquity just like you and i struggling men fish are men that's collector and so on and he call these men and began to share with them seeds and with sharing seeds which is prophecies over them he began to demonstrate the powers of the kingdom that they were going into they don't know about his kingdom he gave them an anointing they went and do works in that anointing but he was showing them that the kingdom i am from it has power it has demonstration it have healing it casts all devils and they say most i do you shall do also all these things was at the intellectual level to these men he appeared among them encouraged them peter went fishing peter in the backswing after he rose from the dead he can't find peter peter got a virgin and have his own little fellowship and peter going fishing what they used to do three and a half years ago peter in a condition jesus still come after them because these are the men god gave him and he called them they get settled stand up in the upper room until they get poor from on high no the church is about to be built this is the the church in action this is the original church this is the church that called longed for proud of this church that's when they started up they get licks they get blows because they was manifest in god we have no licks to get and manifest unless we start to manifest god when god is manifested the devil is angry when they stagger in the upper room barramundi the devil just turned over and he didn't bother with them because he finally just having a fanatical time they only have a whoopee hello your glory are rolling the floor and whatnot right you never got impressed with her see it and then moving with that when the life is being made manifest that's a different thing altogether now how did they give me the upper room i am worried i have feeling with him i think no that wasn't that i wasn't the talk they received what was spoken to them mary magdalene was there mary the mother of jesus was dear the andrew was there apostle was there prophet was there pastor was there teacher was there congregation was there everybody was there waiting on a promise that god has made so i i don't understand this big me little you and who higher who are more revelation and whatnot i don't even understand those things those are mysteries to me those are serious myths recently what i understand is that the grace of god has come to us open our eyes save us how thankful we should be every single day you should be grateful every single day should be thankful god you still have a roof over your head you have some place to sleep you have you still eaten you're still moving on yes you might not have all what you would want or but god given you what you need and that's and to that end you should be grateful you know you're moving into vision you john had a vision all these seals and breaking our seals and white was from there's vision that's not the reality of it think about it now so we have been talking a lot but it's more in vision when you begin to walk in the reality of the vision that's a different story right i visit my home i have a little party i was walking today and i was thinking i said but you know something if 1975 when i was maybe 17 years old god had told me you'll be living 36 chestnut avenue opposite you'll have a park and you will have your grandchildren running there i said my that is something think about it he could have told me that when i was 17 and i was going to just wonder how can this be and the same god that know the end from the beginning know your house your house number nudikaya driving nowhere you go to work know everything about you he could take care of you he could help you he could intervene on your behalf he could restore you he could heal you he'd know every ache in your body he knew every condition he knew his sigh in your heart you know when you're crying you know when you're done you know where you press and guess what he cares for you he genuinely cares for you he's not up in the mountains somewhere hiding and he don't want to care and whatnot no no he cares he genuinely cares for you and he want that word to have that preeminences in your life or could you give me some praises tonight all right let's go now this is to encourage you tonight this is something from the prophet and i want to read it here for you tonight now jesus crossing the boat crossing the sea i could just imagine how that was he preached all day and the night a big storm come up on the sea and like to sunk the little boat wary and tired but never afraid i like that jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day and pray all day and then say no i wonder if i have faith enough to do this he was here we go he was unconscious of the faith that he had and any men or woman that ever make real warriors in the kingdom of god is perfectly unconscious to their feet you keep trying to test your feet i wonder if i have enough faith enough to do this have i got enough it don't test your feet god said so do it anyhow god churchill have you ever tested your feet whether you have enough feet to come to the meeting or not tonight did you test your feet to see if you had enough feet to eat your supper tonight do you think you have enough to fast a while and then test your feet to see if you have enough feet to drive your car home certainly not it's just automatically you believe and that's the way you believe healing believe anything god said just don't fight at it and shake at it and rebuke the devil every minute just accept it and go on that's it and there's nothing to be alarmed about god said so and that's settle it oh my so friends i hope this encourages you tonight about this feet it's an unconscious feet you already have it it's inside of you god sent a message to activate that fate just before i came on uh my son gideon called me and he told me i was driving his car and he got a flat tire and then he changed his style he got one thing and then he started to think about he said he was just telling me he said he has four nuts hole in this tire he said people has wanted not to have faith they have faith to drive the car and as he says four little nuts you know four little nuts and he turned in nothing and and he like you get a revelation of faith at work four knots holding an attire and you busting it down the road not even thinking twice it's just four knots not 24 4. that's what we're talking about well i want you and i we have to live that kind of way where it's not a matter do i have enough feet and take a deep breath rule out and then if you come out no no no you're just going to pray for the sick you're going to pray for your bread over your bread you're going to pray for your breakthrough you're going to pray for your healing and have confidence that god who made a promise he's going to bring that promise to pass do you love him tonight i trust this would help you in some way tonight amen so therefore the kingdom of god doesn't come without trials men press their way into it oh the kingdom of god doesn't come back by observation so friends i want to encourage you tonight because this ephesians church we're going back to and we have to go back that is god's gold standard that is called gold standard not galatians not hebrews not corinthians even though it have those types the target or the mark or the goal is to touch down to ephesians that is where we had ended ephesians paul had no issues paul just dropped the bomb on them and let them know that he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and predestinated us under adoption and this is a great high calling in christ jesus it is the it is the greatest thing that you could that you could see as a goal as an achievement a very high calling called into this position to be adopted into the kingdom of god so your desire tonight shouldn't be i want to be in a church or i want to join a church your desire is to conform to that spot where you're responding to the high calling in god in other words the olympics they get the very best every country will just speak up people hey you feel if you look at run they run let me see okay you're looking like you're running fast that's not always work that's not hot you have qualifiers everybody have to get the test you're running this race you're in that race good you want tree out to the best tree then them you know when you line them up and you run when they get the very best then they send them to the olympics because they have a price together it might sound like a small price base a big gold medal or whatnot one person win that and the whole country hey every whole country you know up row get house they get money manchester united are javelin and he get a whole set of things for president javelin afterwards everybody's had a pelt looking to build something but the point about it is this you cannot you cannot you're not trained and expect to be in the olympics so if god ever of a bunch of people that he predestinated you could have been born in neutral age work at a predestinating wesley age and all you you're dressed right up here awesome buggy on those so you're waiting to write oh i'll cut you're hitting your horse and buggy to go home and god choose to bless you to go beyond that and bring you in this age for a purpose a special purpose you have passed two different groups different pastors different ministers and preachers because you're struggling you're fighting you you're looking for something you're looking to get a word from the lord you find yourself in this circle of fellowship because this is what this is is fellowship and in this fellowship now god could help you and present you with a vision and this vision is to give you access rights that you could be effectively empowered as an individual not dependent let me say that again i'll just say this we are not here to downgrade you to um like so the catholic church have bishops at bishops cardinals and and eventually there are poops like i don't know all he ran something but there's really plenty names candy titles because you have to move up the ranks beautifully just have sons and daughters have some other daughters and his sons and daughters uh have to be assisted in being perfected by five offices that's what he set up which is pastor teacher prophet evangelist an apostle these gifts are not to be glorified men but these gifts are to for the saints let me say that so these guys are to be used for the same sport buster that means they asked to serve the saints not the saints of them i think i think sometimes people are they cannot back the front the objective is is for these guys to be channels of god that they could get the people into a relationship with god that the people could have direct access to presence and power because the levitical priesthood has been cancelled sorry hallelujah and there's a new uh priesthood after the order of manchester united forgets it i i i will that's why i will go together hallelujah a new order has been has been ordained of god because when god canceled the old priesthood when jesus came the veil was read from the top to the bottom to give direct access so this this special priesthood thing that only this man could go in god cancel all of that and make a way that you the people could come right in and that is why it has always been about his people my people shall never be ashamed this is what this is about and you can understand god's burden when the church begin to fall away let me say it again you could understand why god could say this is one thing that you have that you hate the deeds of the liquor later which i also hate he identify the rulership of man over his people the spirit of man has something to hate and whatever god hate we have to hit whatever god love we have to love god is desirous of reconciling his sons back into a relationship with him hallelujah not a relationship true men not a relationship truly pastor bishop pope or whatever mary or any accessory or any other assistance or whatever it is what the burden that god has sent forth is to it's the true the ministry is to get men right back to god so when it's all over let's let's slide a little down in ephesians till we all come into the unity of the faith all come knowledge of the son of god unto the statue of the measure of the fullness of christ so in other words at the end of it all we become one we become in christ we come we have the each one have our measure in christ they have no big you and little knees have great swivels it has small servants or whatever it is it doesn't have that it have us one in christ jesus i could even go deeper there's neither male or but all one in christ jesus and you could you could push that dog inside that ear that's how deep it comes there is neither june or gentile because the cross reconciled boat hallelujah so even though the jews were once the people of god the the cross make a bridge you know to join together because we they only we only get access because they were blinded it's not because we were righteous it's not because we were so special it's only because they were blinded to give us opportunity so that is why they will be effectively grafted back in when they call come so we as gentiles have a right to give god praise for his grace and to worship him and i think i will get that just now to show you when god too in a way from the jews to the gentiles in the book of acts and we're going to get to that so i trust tonight that this was helpful to you as i said you're having a conversation and um i what i could say here now and and um you know i might be able to preach a pulpit but i could talk it with you as such so when god started to write about the church of ephesus and begin to tell them in chapter 2 of revelation these things said he that who let the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seventh rule and candle six verse two reverse chapter two i know that works and i labor and my patience maybe if everybody can find it generous revelations up to two we just want to read that quickly uh we're gonna read from verse two here i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how though cannot bear them which are evil and those tried them which see their apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and as patients and for my name's sake i have labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou had fallen and repent and do the first works or else i would come into the quickly and remove the candlestick out of his place except or repent but this dollhouse that hates the deeds of of the nicolaitans which i also hate either an ear that i'm here or spiritually in churches now now now i want you to notice that they had labor they had patience that works they tried them who said they were apostles and brother branham said that how they manage that they were saying that you're not seeing what paul said that's how you're managing that yeah yeah you're preaching yeah yeah you're being pulpit you have any congregation but you're not staying with policy that your own doctrine by your own teaching we call paul and we said it last time he said take heed to yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost had made you overseers defeat the church of god which had purchased with his own blood this is from second timothy 4 and he was saying to them for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves entering among you now these grievous wills have suit and tire they do have hairy and scary-looking mulch and suffer this grievous rules is men hood and bible grievous worlds entering among you not sparingly flock also of your own selves to rise outside people but among your own people shall men arise speaking for perverse things to draw object to draw away disciples after them and then we read the scripture from 2nd corinthians 3 5 examine yourself whether he be in the fate prove your own self so it's not a matter of coming to church now it's a matter taking your word as a applied mirror to examine yourself and the amplified says examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you're holding to your feet and showing the proper fruits by it so it's not a matter of i'm in church no what kind of fruit are you buried i'm in church what kind of life are you living i'm in church or you acting how are you operating so it's a little more than i'm in church that is not even i'm not imagining it's not imaginary these innovation groups and churches are what they intend to stay here they're not they haven't for them is down here we go into a place we have a high calling to leave here you you follow i'm saying and that is why we are called to this rapture and faith so let's continue now oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah okay so we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit from the first original church was founded and how god manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is god and if there's one thing that the lessons and the bible studies have brought is that the word is god the church really is the devil and the church really is something that is a perversion but the word is god the word from elijah was god so whatever elijah speak it has to come to pass i want you to see the weight of prophetic utterance and why we are so blessed to have a 20th century prophet that god sentenced last year to turn our hearts back to the fate of defense we are tremendously blessed i i mean i wouldn't want the ministry if i didn't have a prophet message it doesn't make sense to me because the bible is a seed book he'll come in and the book being unsealed give us access rights understand this the code or the fingerprint or the fate to access the rights of god is only for that bride the nominations and the rest of the church can't access it because only the mighty angel came nobody book open to reveal the names that's how we get called bringing a call from baptists on mesut we get called from the angel with the open book is the open book message that called you and i and that's why we are brethren we are called by our message you will be tired you may be wary you may belong to benjamin tribe or or or some other tribe is uh julia tribe whoever try to belong to but we are family family of god that's what it's about god want to have a restored church somebody say restored back there restore church don't restore church you have to restore you because the church is he called out so you who make up the church he has to restore you he's not trying to replace you i might get that he's going to correct you however you are you could be contrary as ever and some of you you know yourself i'd rather call you your problems but i'm saying he called you and that's that enjoy understand he called philip he called andrew he called the tax collector hey tax collector you know it's too good too cheap where they got one call bring your taxes and different things like that cass collector wasn't a nice man but guess what he he deliberately called one because one of them was a name in the book and that fellow wasn't making jokes in taxi next minute he's in church he's brethren and you know he squeezed it last week i know this week in church and he had to turn around and shake his hands god bless you my brother did jesus arrange all of that that issue is among themselves because they were human just like us we have issues in families issues and marriages issues and homes issues in business issues all wrong that's all it is it is what it is hallelujah but guess what a change was coming and that change has come from the inside as human beings we see it in america we see the management we see them you know people deal with things and deal with issues there's problems in america because there's issues in leadership and character in america and around the world there are issues in churches their issues and homes and lives and marriages and everything else not issues but part of that have to do with internal stuff and the internal stuff reflect on how we manage or we deal with challenges or we deal with issues and that where jesus was so great he knew judas was judas the first time judas come in the church and say hallelujah glory i want to get baptized jesus knew who he was from he started jesus didn't know get information about judas he knew him and guess what he treats him like brethren even when he was a betrayed he said whatever don't do is do quickly all them brothers talk he gonna get more bread he called for he going for some more wine or something like jesus never and that's the maturity that was there because that's the man to betray him who is he gonna use peter peter hardly named but there's a man to be trained so that man was part of the package that god already and this is life so you can't go and say judas and you're that in the country no leave you that's alone had his part to play peter have his part to pray and guess what everybody have a part what your burden should be lord what is my part the pastor talked about revival if i haven't had to stop me oh oh god cleanse my heart lord push me cleanse me rearrange me inspire me this is what you have to see what is my call you get a burden every service has been responsibility every permitting is a responsibility every bible study is a responsibility you think it's not just easy for but he's like to come and just share stuff like that it's a commitment it's a responsibility it's a burden to pack to share and this is more even more difficult because we're not really seeing you in reality we see you yes here but you know we know your dear and all that connection and social uh thing like that is not dear so it makes it even more difficult and we have to go on here it is i'm preaching on sunday morning as 10 people there ten people there and i want to run out of church five ten people and sometimes it sounds like it's crazy like i see but anthony's singing about he's cutting the music i'm thinking like i say lord have mercy see this man caught up caught up as if the people right there but guess what angels are already there hallelujah we have we have heavenly hosts all around but i'm saying this is what makes it so real it's a joy it's a joy to serve the lord it's a joy to be and it's always a joy for me to look back and see like what brought us from and where we are now and where are we going on to the challenge i'm seeing now is how much we're going to press and strain towards what is before us not just press but strain people do like to stream they want to reach their hand and they get it right there right there they wish to plum the apples everything right there and fake everything that's right let's let's pick it right they should come down to them like i said when people go price smart if they give them a chance to drive straight into the price of the car they want the drive straight in the private car they don't want the park and walk everything must come easy everything will become smooth this this is how life is but that is not how it really is when you see what you're supposed to possess you press i know the something that i read someday but the brahman says when the spirit falls the mark of the beast comes out also that is a confirmation his spirit must fall if you have a mark that the beast it must have a marking of god how could god send down the mark and the the mark of the beast and there's no mark of god even the the income writer was said mark them first before you take the rest so i am saying to you the spirit fallen that that other problem you know is what is falling on so so don't worry about the spirit falling you're going unfold and you're going to flip things upside down into her and around the world his spirit will not do that remember we're in charge of that not me not the church it's god when the day of pentecost was fully come oh glory to god they win one mind and one accord and then something broke so man is not in charge of the spirit god is a man in charge of delivering the word delivering message given a word man can do that but the operation of the spirit that belongs to god and that is what we are here for tonight to get the conductor of the word to get it inside your heart inside your life that when that spirit come that touch don't hit you it could flow through you no hindrance nothing stop on the floor of god in your life no sin no unbelief no negativity just just a flow of god flow into your life this is what that is about oh blessed be the name of the lord let's continue oh praise god so watch thus the church that was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church each close as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life there is a there is an apostolic age going on secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the bible has been completed that is untrue there is not even one scripture that suggests but may conclusively state otherwise here is our proof acts 2 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost from as the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call the promise of power here we go which with which the apostles were endued at pentecost is to you the jews and to your children the jews and to all that are far off the gentiles and to as many as the lord our god shall call o jew and gentile until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease oh glory to god what the church had at pentecost here we go listen it's a inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse gifts and wonders and gift of the holy ghost so what they had at pentecost was the rights of the believers the rights so here is if you must say it differently you must crush that sin barrier or that one belief or that lack of fit i will see that lack of faith in order to see this as your right we feel we fail we you know we did all kind of stuff and things like that and then if you don't get that corrected or get it right repent and get the blood to cleanse you and everything else you'll find yourself short on the fee to believe this is yours so you know it's right you know that we're supposed to have but the fate because you remember the currency of god's fate not your tears not not your old not your agree here and you're feeling what feasts are you feminine you know if you're sorry you look like look you know no no it doesn't work so the realm that that the spirit is in to operate it responds to faith and you don't even have to be a christian to have their feet because these are people who came to the banner meetings and it was even christians they just believe they come for the daughter they come for the healing the woman who came to jesus and said my daughter is vex the devil she wasn't a christian she wasn't a believer the men would tear up the roof and let down the friend with the policy and whatnot he wasn't believers they just came because they had a need in need the woman with the blood issue she came not because she was a believer she came because she had a need and she had faith to believe that if she touched the hem of his garment she could be made whole so the thing about it you could be a sinner here tonight you could be in an accident tonight you could be whatever condition you're in tonight and have a need and because you have a need god could come and listen to your need because you have faith in asking for the supply your needs and god can come and honor that fate that is what is all about when the woman had the dead baby and they asked her is all well she hustling hustling hustling speeding down the track and she said oh all his wealth man with that smile all his men aren't she going onto elijah because she tell herself this man would tell me this i haven't had a child i couldn't have children she blessed me and whatnot this man had to have resolution for that i'm going back to this house he sourced any blessing he saw us when he stopped all this thing he that begin he could work and you is able to complete it into the end you're going back to this house so when when you see it like that then you could push them the confidence you have in god the confidence you have any word and then you could get what you have you know this is what this is about applied christianity husband love your wife we aren't reaching there yet but i'm saying in ephesians itself the target the goal have applied christianity mystery between christ for this course shall a man leave his mother and father cleave on to his wife husband of your wife wife will be your husband children will be your parents and so on put on your armor of god get get get get blowed up and so on like that all of that is in ephesians apply christianity not just before the function of the world not just your seal the day of promise and whatever the promise of the holy ghost all these things inside of there and this is where we had to get to not the informational part but the applied part i am concerned about the applied path that we present towards the mark yesterday back home and you know um and just letting things go and you know well yeah what's in my message because afterwards and but i'm time you said that the people get your customer signs and wonders this year that's america they're playing miracles last night you know they come normal ordinary they they say too much it's come ordinary and the burden no longer there we can't get here we have reached nothing yet paul said i press i press i not that i have to obtain but i press i strain what what what i can't say we are a revival our wood revival why should i be satisfied with a wood revival yeah yes but i don't know what i want i want wordpress so i could just assign except for have a world revival it would be a public show and so on a public show said mark 16 is a public show these signs shall follow them i believe not even the ministers everybody in this room scientists could follow you because if you believe science could follow you layers upon your sick shall recover you have to pay god for that you don't need money for that when god saved me i did not pay no money you have no money without money without price the salvation is free it's the blood of jesus by giving the opportunity to have access right your sanctification glory is evidence that your name is on the book on you tonight glory let me jump up one more year tonight it's not your intuition your sanctification is a witness that your name is on the book if your name is in the book more than jordan even hallelujah you'll be sanctified because sanctification is the groundwork and and and for the revival to break oh glory to god in this evil age yes you choose a bride that's going to be cleansed and washed by the washing of water by the wood why because you have a high college shout out high calling hallelujah listen you call her any prime minister think about it they're just like election and they stand up there and they'll go and talk and talk and get votes and whatnot you can't handle that you have a high call in christ jesus think about it a high call you say prime minister to get escorts and police courts and blue lights and everything else in front of him and everything else right because of your high calling you have been under protection you have angelic assistance you have all you have had them around you you're not seeing them you're not conscious of them but they are there because of who you are do you think anything in the very mary some big big cat coming down some barrel rule of some some some chariot and come and tree don't hit mary and married her messiah forget it that brother stopped before then shut down nothing could stop mary nothing couldn't stop him listening somehow to stop zechariah because unbelief make him make him get dumb because god tell him is why god have a son and everything else but unbelief taken god said what you need gabriel tell him you will be dumb until this thing manifests then you go speak oh hallelujah so god some people might just have to be done until the manifestation come because god's saying all these things that is prophesied it can't fail oh hallelujah i feel this heart tonight feel good tonight oh praise the name of the lord but isaac had to help me finish him oh glory hallelujah please you see there's different things that we have to be doing so but imam was saying here now you read the script of hebrews 2 wonderful and this is serious therefore therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them slip so just thinking about the sharpness and your ability to listen with a keen air because you don't want to slip on these things for if the word spoken by angel was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience to the word receive a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will that original church was not organized by men it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to god it stayed with the original wood pattern that is the original church it's steered with the wood pattern no um we we sometimes think okay we're living in modern times modern times but but listen to these words in luke 17 as it was in days and noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man so it's not just me living in modern times the spirit that was back there is the same spirit that is now here at the spirit level is the same spirit the same spirit that was in sodom settlement and burn and so on but you see the spirits that was in southern is what come back here now and like we're talking about um the whole spirit of the coming of the lord the spirit of judgment all of that have to come upon the people ready for the atomic ready for judgement and another the spirit of god they call upon you and i ready for revival ready for your pouring ready for breakthrough his wife had made herself ready his wife had made his head let us think it his wife had made herself ready do you know that this whole corner virus will bring the bride of christ around the world closer to god and closer in his word do you know god had arranged this that we could have this bible session this bible session this was not going to be outside of this situation almighty god designed all of this not for us to backslide and for us to get weaker and for us to get lackadaisical also get thoughtful for us to strain and press to see the promises is just as real and this is a rehearsal of what is to come at the demonic level at the political level what we talk about the threefold court of satan political religious and demonic a three-fold chord to come against the church let me say it again the threefold chord that will come on against the church political religious and demonic this is a small sample of that with the government giving instructions as to what to do and how long to do it so the government say one hour service and we can tell the government no because that's his instructions you follow what i'm saying no they can't tell us what to preach that that coming is not only they put pressure on the system right now they can't say nothing much you see when you power come let me let me share this with you now if the power of god struck the church of god and and and quran disappear yeah just blue that's crazy right but you know what going on they will say the power is in church and sickness have not no sickness because italian walking blind seeing that that's a holy thing that is where the satan gets mad because he doesn't want a reproduction of the original green that is what brother baron came to me a reproduction of you no no modern thing well you know saints you know by us this is how we just operate and um we've seen it so you see what does this talk is all that talk i'm not talking about that because we have plenty of that you know well bypass i've seen it so you know we see very different yeah you can see with whatever glass is using you see this would be made manifest is i've heard but now i see this is the confirmation or the vindication or the manifestation is i know we see it so i just text and information like greek and fooling with romans and stuff something like that this is not that we're talking about this is the sons of god coming forth no but i'm using terminology the word born into manifestation that means there will be a fossil a second pole and a turple or let's say this way there'll be a lion there'll be a beer and there'll be a goliath the goliath will be the rule concentrations you go that will be when they press come down that goliath but we have to deal with the biannual island before the amigo line so there must be experiences that god has predestinated and ordained even now that will make you press that will make you push you know i'm seeing this precious virgin out there lovely saints out there nice believers over there but you know what they are covered by a wrong spirit they are naughty but evil spirits hateful jealous envy all kind of cuckoo things that pastors and ministers put on them i'm telling you the truth is spirits pour them in the way of dogs be aware of this beauty of that we are all kind of characters people preaching for contention and whatnot because this message is a message to bring us the love i'm going to wrap up this rebuke that god gave the ephesus group to church he said i i love your works i love this but one thing i i i rebuke i want to rebuke you for is if you love the left the love the performing the working the achieving the exposing them when error spirit of error false apostles false teachers message popes being busted but guess what this mark the first church had they had love they had love they had the bond of perfectness always in love with different not like not liking plenty like my brethren not that they had love genuine love we have to get back here to access that broadly kindness is just before that love love to access that you have to be able to forgive and i want to bring it tonight a little different not just forgive your brothers but to forgive yourself you have to be able to forgive to forgive even yourself because growing blood atones for you forgive for you you you you you talk about forgive this one i forgive that one have you forgiven yourself why are you still fighting up with your own self-condemnation because of your past let your past be your past tonight take the scriptures we read tonight forgetting the things that have passed i press to watch them listen righteousness is getting less and less paramount saw the moon blacked out and you put a little sliver of life to represent the bride it is getting darker and darker because isaiah prophesied gross darkness covered here even if you have what is it i can't light and and and and cover up like that soon yours is a little light you still have light i don't care how small your light is tonight it's still a light a light that could shine for your loved ones for your family for your neighbor whoever you meet the world is in gross darkness the world is deceived democracy america is a failed republic of field democracy democracy has failed communism has failed the the rulers of the it has failed this is what is showing up right now a failure all around and god brought it to that kingdom of the kingdom everyone coming inferior look at america look at the condition of america not even african-american not even any other condition look at the condition americans could that be so you know when the bomb said rome the bible said all will wander after you know they will wander after that and the bible talk about in her was the blood of the matters of jesus 68 million christians died during the dark ages let me repeat that again italia killed six million jews but 68 million christians died during dark ages and these people was killing christians thinking between goddess service and if they go back in the bible jesus said he all will come when they will kill you thinking they're doing good i we should be grateful tonight for the love that he have expressed to us by sending us our message not because we have the message but because we see the need now to apply the message god will keep his word you have heard me say as i close many times the message world has not seen god's judgment they love the prophet they love the books they love the tapes they want to argue and fight and carry on but i've never seen the wrath of god the judgment of god when moses was told to speak to the rock and he took the rod and smite the rock water came out him because it was god's people god told moses specific instructions speak to the rock it'll bring forth water it's his people people need water moses was upset moses was angry and he smoked wrong god had pulled moses aside and talked to him about that he said you didn't glorify me apply for yourself now that's a different level together you don't go in that business between father and son god and prophet you know go inside of the air and argue on debate with that this is all god deal with this man when god talked about the brain and be more sincere we can't go and argue with that from our standpoint he's a prophet he's fine he's preaching word you have something that won his miracles from the father standpoint from god's standpoint he needs to be more sincere i think tonight that that's you know we need to come to a place where we are stripped we recognize we are nobody god don't need us we need him and to see god move we need to be more sincere let us borrow heads tonight i um are things other things i could say but i'll just let that be tonight heavenly father i thank you tonight for your divine love and presence and i and i pray i know it's all broken up and um but i pray that you could stitch together and give them a special touch tonight a special a blessing in their souls the night of your presence of your power i told them having a conversation with them and i think i may not see behind the pulpit but i could share from my heart and share with them lord knowing that you going to confirm your word knowing that you're going to manifest your word we try all these years not to point the people to ourselves but appoint them to christ this has been our burden lord we and i give you a pledge lord years ago not to rule the people with rigor what i see men with legalism and everything else and i avoided that when all the hours come law to just lay the wood on the line and encourage the people to take a hold of it lord to embrace it to cope with it lord father bless him tonight bless his gathering tonight and and father bless bless what we're gonna have tomorrow night have you on the way i pray and jesus might ask it amen i want anybody anthony's around that he could give us a song and oh blessed be the name of allah could you give us a song praise the lord glory to god hallelujah let's just wish the lord a little bit tonight you've got some praises lord we thank you lord we bless you lord i appreciate you oh god may we strain and press our way into this glorious kingdom hallelujah thank you lord don't keep an eye on me i'm going to get you sorry about that he's good amen hallelujah thank you jesus thank you father amen all to jesus are surrendered all to them [Music] and trust [Music] surrender [Music] oh [Music] i don't mind waiting [Music] i don't mind waiting [Music] oh i don't [Music] oh i don't mind waiting [Music] amen i uh god bless you church i don't uh have much comments after that i think it was a really true true genuine blessing i really appreciate the word tonight he appreciate our pastor this evening amen and sharing from his heart is he he's a man of few words he's a preacher with few words so it's it's it's tough for those of you who've had the pleasure of getting to talk to him on the phone i always tell the church that um i've said it before sometimes that much recently as about a week or so ago i called him money he hung up on me before i get to you know so um but uh truly a blessing tonight and a real encouragement on that strain and i like the conversation about his train and um i would have said it before that most people underestimate the effort it takes to achieve anything you know we take it for granted um we we look at the situation and you know we say well it will be this amount of effort to get it done and many times i don't know if you ever found yourself you realize that you didn't factor certain things into the equation you know and then you end up recognizing well you know it'll be half an hour to get there and then you realize half an hour pass and you're not there whoever there is it's because you're underestimated what is the traffic you're underestimated a situation you didn't think about and and then when you confront the reality of it you recognize that if you are given a little more if you had done a little more if you had put more in place if you had more preparation in there it would have increased the probability the possibility of the final outcome you know and so too in the spiritual realm we find that most people underestimate you know what effort they have to do in their prayer life and to see you know they would come and speak about that strain that push um you know that that that the kingdom is preached and every man have to press into it and the reality is and you look at your room tonight you look at you know everyone connected tonight the kingdom is preached and every man press the reality is you know there there are quite a number of people here tonight and and there are people pressing on different levels you know and and i remember preaching the message have we done enough and it was sort of trying to put a line the sun so to speak that if the past mark is is 90 you getting 89 percent is not enough so nobody is saying you're not pressing nobody is saying you're not doing but he just missed it by one mark because he passed mark was 90 and in this great commission this great call that we are called to where the blood has to be on your door post you cannot have it you need to have it you know and and it's as a reminder and a challenge for us to go all the way so i really appreciate it tonight and i want to encourage the church to go all the way i want to challenge you know you to double your efforts you know there's there's there's something to be said about doing more there's something to be said about you know not taking it for granted there's something to be said about pushing to the limits you know um and that is what overcoming is because overcoming is is being able to go over whatever it is to be able to to go beyond the pressures because the pressures come the pressures will come and there's no promise in scripture that speaks of depression not coming and the pressure just disappearing you know the pressures are designed they have been selected for us they have been designed for us the trials have our name written on it whether you consider it fortunate or unfortunate you can't send these things back because they are for our perfection and it's the it's the bring out the best in us so and god knows exactly what aspect of our lives he need to put the right pressure on for us to change understand that what god is doing is for us to change um so if he sees some tempo in us that needs to be addressed he will send situations in us until we could pass that temper test he will send situations for us until we can pass the patient's test you know what said and and he said it tonight there's no school of of parenting there's no school of marriage there's no school there's no finish in school and you could study for this thing and and and the reality is life will still give you a curveball you know as prepared as you think you are in whatever situation you would see is is that is how life is but there are people who no matter what comes their way and i realize more than the knowledge more than ability is really about the attitude you know because if your attitude and you can see why the prophet would say the right mental attitude to any divine promise of god want to bring it to pass because there are people who don't have all the knowledge but because they have the right attitude to how they approach life they are successful there are people who don't have the they didn't grow up in the best home you know and you have people who grew up in a nice home and the attitude horrible you have people who who who have money and attitude horrible and when you see the end you see why god will say to david have you considered the end when you see the end of it you look and say but wait now was it all worth it so i want to challenge us tonight through this whole experience that has forced such a reflection in our way in our walk in our talk in our life in our deliberations and i would have said it months ago since as early as march and april and these earlier months this this this pseudo lockdown that we are still partly in and trying to come out of has been a great opportunity for you to make deposits into the bank of your life it is a great opportunity for you to to sharpen your skills sharpen your prayer life sharpen your your knowledge sharpen your experience take a time so that when you come out to this thing you'll come out strong we're not supposed to come on to this thing we can't know friends we're not supposed to come out of this thing wondering who we are this is a time for us to reflect and learn and study and say you know what i am a child of the king as brother of it said the catholic church have already hierarchies but in god's kingdom is just sons and daughters and these sons and daughters take up their spiritual ranks kings and priests dominion you know so i'm speaking to royalty tonight i'm encouraging royalty tonight and i want to encourage you that christianity christianity which is to be christ-like we're not talking about church here but christ like is really living for others you know and and most of us we are we are so we end up sometimes so selfish that we don't see that when jesus came it was not about him it was about others so i want to challenge you as well to extend yourself um as we are preparing to go back into the tabernacle for a restricted time so to speak this coming sunday um make it all come come on time come early make a just one hour service so make our effort come in time sanitize go through the process so that you know when we when when we come there we have the right attitude to get the most value but everyone was preaching last sunday and i'm sure you would have heard it we don't need a three-hour service we need a four-hour service we we take in the opportunity we get and we understand that the prophet said it takes five minutes in the presence of god to see the angel of the lord you need the the spiritual begin to work and heal and touch and seal and deliver and break chains so stay on your firing line let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer tonight well gracious heavenly father we thank you for your love for your mercy for your grace that is truly sufficient lord when we look back at the months and look back at there are so many different stories and different situations and there are so many things that we can hear and see there's so many so much negativity in there lord that when we could look at how you are taking us through we can truly say it's been you it's been you or guiding you directing you preserving us lord and lord we we are we are walking in your playbook as it were lord to see that you have ordered these steps as bit of it said had it not been for this situation as it were we wouldn't even be meeting like this on a tuesday night how you orchestrated this in such a way that you could bring reconciliation of your children back to the house of god as the father of the prodigal son was looking out to see when his son would come home because he had walked away thinking he had it all together not realizing that he was missing so much and when he was found himself in a place where he shouldn't be in he he he came to his senses as it were and began the journey back home and all of that was to bring healing to him bring healing to his father and to even bring help to to that older brother who didn't know what was locked up in him until the situation came to expose it and how we see this whole situation has created an uh a new normal in the natural but more than that a new normal in the spiritual and we thank you for this opportunity to have a conversation around your word to have a sharing of the heart and to have our pastor tonight to speak to us lord from the word of god from the scriptures from the the the ministry of this great elijah prophet that lord without this prophetic ministry we wouldn't even know how to go how to move how to operate but we could speak from an open book tonight and
