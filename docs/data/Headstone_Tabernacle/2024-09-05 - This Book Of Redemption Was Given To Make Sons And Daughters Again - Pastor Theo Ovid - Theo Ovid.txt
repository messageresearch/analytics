name amen and amen God bless you you thanks again for being here tonight and if have your Bibles I like to turn to 1 John chapter 1 we're want to read 5 to1 1 John Chapter 2 9-11 Revelation 5 1-7 so good to be here tonight see all of you out God bless you welcome and uh from 1 John 1 ver5 this then is a message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light in him is no Darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins to cleanse us from all unrighteousness that's the deal if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us and we go to chapter 2 and reading from verse 9 it reads he that sayith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light right and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and WTH in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that Darkness has blinded his eyes Revelation chapter five reading from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seeds thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open man to read the book and he to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the land of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven sees thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the ERS stood a lamb had been slain having 7 horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne praise God God bless you may have a seat may God bless this reading of his word always it's good to be here tonight I thank God for all the services that has gone on uh previous to this one and we just thank God for the gifts and the blessing that has blessed us by the word so tonight I have a a title uh and and um well Steven really was blessed with in a special way and I got some stuff from it and I I told him and and I have some something that he he said but I want to title this this tonight this book of redemption was given to make sons and daughters again you hear about the book and the Book of redemption and the Seven Seals but there's a object that this book has and the purpose of this book is to make sons and daughters again the book purpose of the book is not for argument is not for debate it's not for doctrinal differences the object of God is to make Sons and Daughters of God by this book or through this book now the Pentecostals couldn't come through because they rejected the word because they rejected the prophet so they didn't have the word to get the seed to become the word because the word was yet to come the Pentecostal was the birth if they had received the message which was the word they could become sons in the TRU sense of sons so this message is the key to our sunship and our inheritance and our godship praise the Lord now when God made man he made him dust he made this a little certain compartment in the man for his throne his controll Tower God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore there's a walk constantly think quot this but even read the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes and there's where he deceived so in other words your five senses is lying to you because your five senses is declaring what your eye taste fell all those things but the faith comes by the word and Faith make you see God because Faith connects with the word right you can only get Faith by hearing the word so when your word is preached to you faith is activated to begin to begin to get a glimpse of what God sees and how God sees it oh praise the name of the Lord so watch that is where Satan deceived Eve by what you could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye it was death to the soul so it is tonight God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of God getting off of his own leading is what separated him from his fellowship and when and that is where we stand tonight all those who are led by such things but the scripture said Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God not by your emotions not by your feelings not by your imagination Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God I feel and I feel and I feel you feel nothing forget your feeling what did God says you have to be led by the spirit of God isn't that right now watch it there now watch and you notice a man or woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they can never please God but a man and woman that will not look to the things of the world and just go according to the leading of the spirit they are are usually in the will of God so the spirit's leading and remember the spirit will not lead you contrary to the word then you know it's not the Holy Spirit right praise God so Satan took the eye a man's head to control him by his head because the eye have plenty touch points you see coffee you see cake you want to eat cake you see a Roy shop you want Roe you see this one hi hello and you see your phone and WhatsApp your eye your eye eye and head eye and head what your eyes see every day is all color is all connections and Satan take the head but there's something deep that God puts that in your heart that's why you can't even explain you why you still connected to this gospel you can't even explain why you keep holding on why something you keep believing it's not you it is something in you something you can't explain that's how you supposed to know is God is something you cannot explain God put that in you not your mother not your father not your uncle not your aunt not your grandmother not your great grandmother God put that inside of you Hallelujah that's his Gene that's his germ that's his seed that's why Jesus could confidently say no man could come to me except my father draw him and all that the father had given me will come Jesus the confidence because in you once God put it in you it got to come it got to respond where there's a deep deep calling you got to have a deep to respond God knew what he put inside of you he knew what will activate you he knew what will draw you he knew what will call you hallelujah hallelujah let's go man is always trying to achieve something by his head he's supposed to achieve but by his heart that's why your head thinking one thing but your heart see something else like you know you you meet somebody and and and and you know they they say certain things and what that and that's all sudden your heart a red flag go up something just can't explain but something all a sudden there is like something I ain't clicking with that person you know like something fishy something not you can't explain it you know but the Vibes that's the heart saying No Deal so the heart that's the controll tower when god control him and directs his thoughts directs his Works directs his emotions sometime I get so happy I just have to let loose if I look around I see somebody then I got my eyes on people then but God helped me to keep my eyes closed I want to be led by the spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do into it we find that this man is controlled by a controlled Tower and that Tower makes him what he is it moves him Hallelujah so the real you is not the head so much that head have intentions good intentions is go straight to hell but the heart is the real you that's the real you your head G Fight your head go oh a lot of problems up here a lot of battles up here a lot of confusion up here but deep down what you are is as a man thinking is that so is he what you are here in your heart that's that's you and the tower makes him what he is it moves him he lives by it it's his emotions he lives by it now why where they are waiting on the spirit to know what to say and okay I'll go God knows what he's doing as long as he's leading you see you must always go by the spirit and the spirit will always agree with the word now if the spirit leads you contrary to the word then it's not the spirit of God if the holy spirit is leading you it will say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now he said all these strange voices in the world of this Social Gospel belongs to church and that has not has and why hasn't it done something it's done nothing but confuse the people what we need tonight is a unified Church filled with the Holy Ghost and power from on high led by the spirit of the Living God on the controlled tower that would that won't say listen listen that won't say because I'm a Baptist and he's a Methodist I'll have nothing to do with him but that is what they say in message not saying these exact words their life and behavior speaks that I am better than them because my pastor have more Revelation than his Pastor or we have more it whatever it supposed to be in our church than that other Church which is foolishness and the Believers are deceived by believing that crap we read a scripture if you say you're walking in the light and hate your brother you a liar because the confession the confession is that as we confess our sins we have fellowship with him the blood of Jesus cleanses us not cleanses them us you included and then we could have Fellowship one with another so what else could affect Fellowship is the Devil Himself affecting Fellowship because God love Fellowship that is why he put man on the earth to have fellowship with man oh give the Lord some Praises he was lonesome as Elohim that is why I become Jehovah oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah that's why he create little ones that he could come in the cool of the evening and fellowship with Adam Adam not talking to him Adam not fellowshipping with him Adam not fellowshipping with the next Adam that is foolishness God don't want nothing like that go go Crush that party oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God that the same denominational barriers that come back in the message but God will bust on that party Hallelujah go will bust go will bust man right out the pulpit oh go give the Lord some Praises there's going to be a Revival a seven tunder Revival it have a name for that Revival a Revival of the just oh give the Lord praise God and a bride is the one who is Justified as if she never did it in the first place oh give the Lord I shout we coming back to Perfection that Perfection glory to God we going back to Eden brother Hallelujah so watch this watch this led by the spirit of the Living God on the control tower that won't say because I'm a Baptist and he's a Methodist I have nothing to do with him here we go are you ready a real true spirit of God will recognize his brother or sister I don't care what kind of brand he is wearing in other words you are a son and your daughter and the rest of the message world have to deal with that whether they see you so or not they have to deal with that because you ain't going nowhere and they can't out you oh gor they can't put out your light they can't take your name out the book Oh Glory to God they have to put up or shut up oh give the Lord a praise in the house tonight oh glory to God we ain't going nowhere we staying right here and overcoming we standing right here and represent Jesus Christ Give the Lord some prais oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit walking after the Unseen the way that God leads us the things we see are temporal the things that we do not see are Eternal Matthew 25 verse 31 says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then he shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be goded all nations he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divided his sheep from the goats he shall set the Sheep on the right hand the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungered and you give me meat I was thirsty and you give me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and he come to me and he come unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee are hunger and fed thee or thirsty give thee drink when saw we thee a stranger took thee in or naked and clothe thee when saw we sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and said unto them verily I said unto you in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me this love your brother is more than the people you know this love your brother is more than talk you know this have to do with the kingdom here and the kingdom to come oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah here we go verse 41 then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me cursed into Everlasting fire prepare for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and you give me no meat I was thirsty and you give me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked you clothe me you clothed me not sick and prison you visit me not then shall they also answer him Lord when saw we hungered and thirst and strange and naked sick in prison did not minister to thee then he shall answered very said to you in as much as you did not to one of the least of these you did it not to me if you love God you will love your brother if you love God you love your sister if you love God you will treat one another right and the message world but kangali needs to get that oh give the Lord some Praises this is no message talk and seals and and and vials and plagues and woes and between the six seals and the Seven seal and the six V and seven vile and the first W and the second W they not all that kind of talk this is a life this is the thunder that do shake the devil it have other Thunders that don't shake devil laughing at that but this one is what do shake the devil by this shall all men know that you are my disciples Oh Glory to God this book was given to make sons of God after 50 plus years we have to begin to see what sons of God begin to look like oh God good Lord get help me Jesus after all these years we have to begin to see E when God create monkey and goat and cow and and and and whale and and all that he there was none like him he said let us make man in our image and like this it have to resemble something oh glory to God when Moses was looking to Lord I want to see you when the past he saw the back part of a man an image must reflect something oh give the Lord a shout it can't reflect nothing oh how it must reflect something after all these years we have to see some kind of [Applause] formation Hallelujah a woman say she's pregnant and she going for ultrasound and they see nothing is Burger is is burger or some kind of some other things she e you know in other words you have to see her form you have to see her shape and after all these years you have to begin to see a form a shape and has to be in the Statue of a perfect man it has to be in a a form that reflects God image and likeness it can't reflect you it can't affect your bad behavior it can't affect your temper and your attitude and your you're Vex and you're angry and you're upset and you're hateful and you're miserable you're miserable for 40 years how long you been miserable for like you but God want to bir it from above notice specifically the words of Matthew 25 31-46 he's referring to the script we just read it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep from coats these are not sheep in this particular area of time which is white Throne judgment the Sheep are already in his fold they heard his voice the word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into judgment but these who he's talking about here now do not have eternal life they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would make them joint ISS with Jesus they are not as to anything but life they share No throne with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed but because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved take that devil Oh Glory G to God did you get that there are people that going to love the Brethren and because of their love for the people of God they will be recognized and saved God said so oh give the Lord some Praises there the Lord I shout in the house Glory let's go no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gal they stood for the children in a time of trouble it may seem the smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but are turned into a lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were living manifested word living Epistles for their day and they fail to honor that bad behavior Wicked people and I go call on them Spirits I was telling NM about many times we don't see what God see you know when God see Wicked I was telling about the man with the talent when the man come back and this one have five produce five this one had 10 produce 10 this one have one he bury it well you know he address him Wicked servant you know not you know boy you miss the mark you know you know I mean should have put in back all right no not that you know Wicked who said that God said that that's how God seeing it amen in John 1 let's go in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in him was life the life was the light of men the light CH to The Darkness Darkness compar not let's go he was all right he came unto his own verse 11 and he received him not but as men receive him to them give he power to become so we get a new word now that power has to be released for us to become the sons of God we are Sons Fallen Sons but to become the sons of God he's talking about a different level of sunship he's talking about a real attribute son of his Spirit manifesting what the father had or to be just like the father Oh Glory to God what we manifest now is what our fall nature have we have car house land lights wherever man heart is science and whatnot technology and whatnot but God not in his technology business God in the translation business we have technology that they don't know God in the opening open the prison bars God in the healing business conquering nature business God got a different level all together isn't that right that we back to watch as many as receive him which is the word to them give he power to become the sons of God so becoming sons of God is Not instant it's as brother stepen says a process it's a process to become sons of God you are born and you become you he said you make yourself a Christian you just sit down because watch this power came to the Pentecost 1906 but look how they are they still filthy as they were since back then in other words that power came but they didn't have the word to make them Sons or the word to for the to reform into Sons they didn't have that that's right at this day they're still failing because they don't have the word because the word is what God used in the beginning let there be let there be let there be let there be and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word tonight is still God oh glory to God and the word tonight could transform you if you want to receive it inwardly and willingly not outwardly and formally oh give the the Lord some Praises Hallelujah you receive that word inwardly and willingly and watch that word go to work inside your heart glory to God remember the devil can't get inside the deal because the word is the deser of the thoughts and intents of the heart not the devil the word is Oh Glory to God the devil could play with your mind but he can't mess with that seed inside your heart give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah do you love him do you love the Lord tonight watch as men receive him to them give you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe in his name continues which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God he's saying you'll be born of God and the word here we go was made flesh and dwelt among us but like Abraham could not see that son no signs of pregnancy of Sarah not even menstration periods nothing and yet God said so all hopes her womb was dead his life was him was gone the stream of his life had dried up her life had dried up within her yet he staggered not at the promise of God true unbelief but was strong giv praise knowing that God was able to perform anything he said he would there is the way we got to believe that word today do you believe it like that that God can't lie there's going to be Revival there'll be a super church or super race as we near The Headstone there'll be a power and the shout of the king be the camp the car close us down before time are we not closing down ourselves oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God give the Lord a shout did you hear that they cannot close us down before time and we are not closing ourselves we're going to stay here till power come we're going to stay here till Jesus come we're going to stay here till the shout of the king is in the camp we're going to stay here till the pillar fire hanging on over the building we're going to stay here till the walk the blind see the dead is way we going to stay right here until there going to be a 7 ton of Revival that going to shake the whole nation there'll be a short quick message oh give the Lord a shout that will shake the whole Nation Oh Glory to God what it going to be the comforter Has Come Oh Hallelujah the comforter is the Holy [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Ghost Hallelujah that's the way we got to believe that word today how it's going to be listen you how it's going to be I don't know God said it's going to be that way and that sett it there's going to be a bride in Trinidad how it going to be I don't know the walls going to fall down praise God how it going to be I don't know the honey look like it won't stick but it will stick it will stick Oh Glory to God the bride Oh Glory to God oh my my my my Hallelujah a revelation of justification will come that's the prophecy hang over the he preach it invisibly on the bride he say I want you to know where you're standing tonight you stand Justified as if you never did that you can't claim that in baby form that's a revelation you know when you stand under that anointing by the authority vested in me as a restored son Justified as Satan you have to move right now listen he running out you know he walking out and he running out you know Oh Glory to God because you're standing in the adamic position that it was before the fall that is what brother Bram did he listen God didn't give STI you know he said you give that woman what she want oh give the

prophet and Elohim know what he said to that prophet we're not saying our own thoughts we not saying what we dreamed last night God spoke to that prophet and you know exactly what he said to that prophet and if we believe just what the prophet said it's got to come to pass no devil can stop it from coming to pass Oh Glory to God hallelujah it's got to come the word spoken over you have to come to pass your family will be [Applause] [Music] delivered if you have to believe that Hallelujah [Applause] listen right two boys were snickering you know they was laughing you know they wasn't preparing for church service you [Music] know he said I give them to you because he had the power to do so because God authorized him you have to be authorized to have power if you take power that dictatorship brother George when point you CR on your head hallelujah oh my who is this great unseen person who is this that Abraham seen in Visions right at the last though he was manifested in flesh before the sun came God himself came to Abraham in the form of a man at the end time manifested he saw him in a little light one time he saw him in Vision he heard his voice many Revelations but just before the promised son he saw him in the form of a man and talk to him fed him meat and drink notice God himself failed in human flesh this is a part of his way this is the way he manifest himself to us he manifest his eternal word god Jehovah made flesh like in St John 1 and this so the prophet said it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God then he said this in the beginning was Elohim and Elohim became the word and the Word was Elohim and the Word was made Elohim it's the same thing just unfolding Elohim the thought the word the L ghost the word made flesh then he went on to say this like the attribute see it is God attribute which is your thought God in the beginning the Eternal he was even God he was eternal he wasn't even God God is an object of worship he wasn't even that he was Elohim the Eternal but in him here we go was taught listen tonight he wanted to become material that is the ccs of the matter here right now the thoughts that he had in his mind he wanted it to become material what did he do he spoke a word and the word materialized and that is the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation this word materializing and the Word was invisible until it became flesh oh praise the name of the Lord so God's purpose as brother stepen preached was for you to become manifested God purpose for you to become the word made flesh it is nothing wrong let's go I'm I'm reading it is Elohim materializing so he can be touched and feel and in the Millennium there is Elohim sitting on his throne with all his subjects around him he predestinated before the foundation of the world give the Lord some praise this is beautiful tonight this is God almighty this is not your imagination now this is revelation this is the word praise God and here is the bomb here now he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take his place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublim thing in the scripture an act not an angel not nothing could do it but the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne God laws he's the one that holds it God law required kinsman redeemer and the lamb came out boldly and said I am their Kinsman I am their redeemer I have come I have made intercessions for them and now I come to claim their rights for them amen I come to claim their rights so it's not Jesus dying in the cross he died to get that book he died to claim your rights you couldn't claim it yourself oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God I if if in that they had a right to everything that was lost in the fall and I've paid the price so Jesus was saying I pay the price to restore back to these people what they lost you don't have to pay the price it's already paid he paid it at Calvary he paid it at the cross that we can access these rights but not by Good Works which we have done but by his Mercy Hallelujah and them Elders TR up their crowns and dig begin to get on the ground no one could do it he walked to the right hand of God and took the book out of his hand and claim his rights I have died for them I am the kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become man I did this in order to get that church back again which church the one I foresaw before the foundation of the world I have purposed it I spoke it would be there nobody could able to take it and I went down and done it myself I am the Kinsman I become the kins folk and he takes the book oh give the Lord some Praises tonight who is waiting there for me tonight who is the one church that is waiting there what else could wait for you but the kinsman redeemer he has the title de to Redemption he has it in his hands meditation is done mediation is done he has it in his hands now watch here we go and this is the bom here now the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he come to claim it back to the human race not claim it back to Angels here we go now claim it back to the human this where I get inspiration from the title tonight claim it back to the human which it was given for to make sons and daughters again the book brother Kangle this book was so important oh God have mercy this book is what was given to make sons and daughters again we going back to Genesis let us make man hey in the image and likeness of God brother Bram came and revealed the image of God as Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godness brotherly kindness he bring the image of God back on the earth and said this is it here this is what was in the beginning Oh Glory to God hallelujah and the Prophet come and preach it as a statue of a perfect man put it in the seals and put some thunders all around it and let the ministers fight up with it oh glory to God Seven Thunders seven voices Seven Virtues seven Mysteries seven anointings seven spirits you can't break it it's unbreakable Oh Glory to God this book Hallelujah that's why when the lamb came he came with the book when the mighty Angel come he come with the book open and what happened seven Thunders show their voices what for to get the bride it's the only thing that is exclusive to the bride seven Thunders are gathered right together seven Thunders are show the bride heart to repair seven T going to give the bride only for the bride the church members can keep all the books and tapes oh give and press play oh give the Lord a shout but them tunders go get that bride Oh Glory to God Seven voices to get you those seven Thunders are seven voices a thunder is the voice of God and the voice of God come to you by the word of God to make you a son and daughter of God oh God have mercy this has nothing to with church membership and what church you go to and what church you join that's what the preachers want that your fellowship here that make you want a fellowship here your you head Tabernacle God call to be sons and daughters not to join Church sons and daughters and that starts from the word coming into you to make you a son isn't that right so watch claim it back not to claim it back to the human which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again to bring them back to the Garden of Eden oh B I thought I was tired but not now he get stimulated with this thing here he said I'm getting too old to preach but then I could see something when I see something like like that I think I'm a young man it does something to you for I know this someone is waiting for me someone paid the price I couldn't pay he did it for me Charlie he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes for to claim his Redemptive claim it for who not for himself for us he is one of us he's our kins folk oh man he's my brother he is my savior he is my God he's my Kings My Redeemer he is all for what as I without him what could I be without [Applause] him that one Jesus met the requirement Grace produced the person of Jesus Christ and we find this book now God stretched his tent come from God to become man he changed his strain from the almighty to be a man to take on the form of man so he could redeem thy to redeem man the bride in the Bible in the Book of Ruth you read it such a person was called a goel goel he was called a go it was a person that could meet the requirement and the go must be able to do it he must be willing to do it he must be a Kinsman next to Kinsman and God the creator of spirit here we go became kins folks to us when he become man in order to take our sin upon him and pay the price so he couldn't take our sin upon him in spirit form he had to become one of us and take us as a human as a kins folk that why the word became flesh here we go let's go down a little deeper now there it is there's the Redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has not claimed his possession yet you might different with that just hold on a minute he hasn't claimed it if he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had everything that he lost Christ redeemed back so this is an unfolding Revelation present tense Redemption God redeeming you day by day Christ has redeemed you is already unfolded in his great mind he already redeemed us but he hasn't took possession yet he cannot until the time appointed and then will come the resurrection and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he will take possession he will possess when he come to redeem us he come at the appointed time Give the Lord a praise glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so he hasn't claimed us as yet but the spirit come to redeem our souls redeem our spirit and then there's a fire baptism to redeem our body praise God so we have to die out and we have to have die out and Faith could come out and virtue could come out and knowledge come out the death of a corner weat all these virtues have to be emanating through us he said that God can see these things living in us oh give the Lord some Praises so how that could be and people behaving so badly something is wrong he said the spirit of God can't behave in one man and dis behave in another man something is wrong we talking about the spirit we talking about the seals we talking about the unfolding of the word it has to become flesh tangible and then a favorite quote you quot this so much time the ministry has reached its Perfection when Christ is reproduced in natural I've said that hundreds of times Hallelujah let's say it again the ministry people think they son of man me on a man they think they the prophet next to the prophet under the prophet man of the hour nobody like them they bring the Mysteries unfold the word everywhere they come to them and all the drama all the PO poy they have here the prophet say this the ministry comes to his Perfection when Christ is reproduced in natural not Mysteries not revelation not teachings not 6our sermon and for hour explanation not that when Christ is reproduced in the natural so you want to tell me Christ in a man he can help somebody you see somebody clothed and you wouldn't get him clothed you see somebody hungry and you wouldn't feed them and you claim to what know the mystery that that John yourselves a see you have Revelation at Christ that the prophet reveal and the whole world has seen it so and you seen it so and people still naked people still hungry the only charity they get some we call these people get um them people who with little thing to ring the bell Salvation Army people people going to salv charity them fell in the message mean like the devil Satan had in grip if you say you have you walking in the light and hate your brother you're ly he's a big mystery let me say it again he that say he's the light that would they claiming seven SE light seven thunder light new name light um unknown languages it went into unknown language unknown tongues all that is light you say you have unknown language and you know the other language well I can't interpret I I'm not interpret of tongues you have the new name they have light there too he that say the light and hath his brother is in darkness until now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light there's none occasion and stop and that is why they talk about brother Bram you couldn't know his enemy from his friends that would to say about Jesus you couldn't know his enemy from his friends when he tell Judas where do do quickly them talk he he go for more bread Jus didn't say Judas do quickly and some with a tone say they didn't know when Judas come he kiss Jesus here come they bet that kiss say you're Wicked I go expose it to Jesus take the kiss and just Judas I eat with you you that's how you're coming friends is a life you know he that hates his brother is in darkness there's a church only the whole church in darkness a Visionary Church the whole church in darkness only light is by the exit only light is by the exit the whole church in darkness and the people don't know and the preacher don't know and he preaching normal normal normal but the whole church under Darkness who to tell them not me I Ain called to do that they'll kill me okay so he this part now Fellowship God you take a little more few more I 11 pages on page seven we're going good God wanting to fellowship with man always wanted to do it the Old Testament all of it was full of shed blood without the sheding blood no of sin so God himself cannot deal without this Blood thing because man fell it has to have an atonement we can't explain that but that is how God sees it because he know he's coming to to play the blood price to to remove sin completely but in the meantime he's operating under that temporary Covenant of the blood of bulls and goats he going to accept that and work with that because he have to come down in the appointed time to be made flesh to pay the price that he could enter once forever and kill that dead and free us from guilt and shame and the past we do have to go once a year hoping that God forgive us right Old Testament now watch here we go without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and when there's no remission of sin sin there's no Fellowship that's right so sin breaks Fellowship so if Fellowship is broken sin is at the door sin somewhere near if the Fellowship of the Brethren is broken sin behind the pulpit then sin in the congregation then sin in the group then sin somewhere brother Kangle because sin affects Fellowship because the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin and we have Fellowship one with another so if Fellowship is not there one with another something is wrong somewhere it's not with God it's not with the word it's not with the blood it's not with the message give the Lord some Praises are you with me all right let's go where there is no remission of Sin Sin there's no Fellowship you have got to get away from sin you can have fellowship with God because God can't fellowship with sin you are born a sinner shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies how can you ever do it you might just well quit right now to begin with you can't do it within yourself but there is one who died to bring you to Fellowship back not only to Fellowship but to relationship with God to make you a son and daughter of God so it's more than Fellowship God want to bring you into want want to bring you into a relationship he died for that purpose come here and prove himself Emanuel omnipotent praise God and when omnipotent speaks the miraculous happen now let's go quickly now watch the fellowship how Adam and Eve they turn away from God because of sin had separated them from that wonderful marvelous Fellowship it had to shift for himself he become a Wanderer toss with every wind of Doctrine carried away that's the way he stands today out of Fellowship out of Harmony away from God shifting for himself he creates something in his mind that he believes that God was I used to talk to the people have the god of their own imagination they don't have a god of the word hallelujah they think have an idea what God is God is a a cross God is that Jesus on the cross God is at this God is at that God is because the man I believe God in that man there and I in the right place and the right church and they tie up god with that man and they tie up god with a church and they tie up god with a Doctrine God is nothing to that God is the word oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah that's why they could have never understand Jesus come and say you're hypocrite you talk about the phes and them blast them and them had the long G the long priest Long Tall hats and long guns and well embroidered garments and Jesus blasting them they couldn't handle him he wears too much when he hit the church so and he take a stretch and start to beat them out he said my house called House of Prayer they couldn't handle him he was just like a dangerous rugged Man he said the kingdom of God is at hand them guys know nothing about that Kingdom HJ he said you have not seen his voice you have not seen him or heard his voice but I see him I heard his voice oh glory to God I am his witness when you see me you see the father he Rock them with that oh give the Lord a shout he said Abraham saw my day and was glad talk about you and Abraham he said before Abraham was I am but that that knocked them all cold I was in KN before Abraham was I am oh give the Lord a shout and Jesus said at that day you know I am in the father you in me and I in you at that that day is coming when you're going to come from partial realization into perfect realization where you're going to know who you are you know where you come from and you know where you're going oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God this gospel come to bring us to spiritual maturity Christian maturity to be mature Sons and Daughters of God that can handle God's business oh give the Lord a shout must be about my father business we have some Sons to go after we have people lost in this message we're going to go get them oh Hallelujah this message this message this work a over yet oh give the Lord a shout before this go to the Eternal L there are some lost people in some groups we going to go get them go get them Pride hallelujah praise God oh glory to God Abraham May going in nowhere until lot come out lot had to come out if there's 50 if there is 40 if there's 25 [Applause] God will not let the righteous perish with the wicked wicked sodomites wicked sin someon Sodom Hallelujah lost lot lost his way down there lost his son in law daughter in La he lost people down there and he coming out come come come out wife and all couldn't make it because some was in her heart not her head in know not the head the head say go the head say Keep On Walking the head say don't look back but the heart is one move her back there one more look at how show the dresses how one more look at the lipstick and the earring and all the tattoo and all one more look to see what she was leaving instead of throwing some Dynamite behind and blow up behind you don't even look back we have to do that you know throw the dynamite and just blow up behind you blow the bridge behind you devil like you to have Bridge you know keeping just in case he needs a cross Mar forget that God you a new bridge God could get you a new plan all together blow up behind you man shifting for himself out of Fellowship out of Harmony away from God so what we saying tonight Adam and Eve was in Perfect Harmony because they were in the word When sin came that's when the call stting he said it changed your spirit it break the fellowship between them with God and with each other so if the fellowship with God is restored what going to happen with each other do you see it now when Adam and Eve fell it broke their relationship with God a broken relationship with God means broken relationship with each other so the first thing God has to do was to make us to get back a connection because when you D no D tone line cut sin cut the line what Jesus did by dying on the cross was to bring back a new line through the blood so now we have dial tone and give you a choice to call and to respond he not calling he he put the call already he don't already call you have to respond to the call and once you could call him you could call each other once you have a fellowship and connection with him you can connect with each other if you have if you say I have no sin you deceive yourself so what would make a man not want to Fellowship what not there that word for that you know it start with P it's called Pride people don't want to Humble themselves but pride is a dangerous a deadly a wicked evil thing because that is what Lucifer got in the beginning he said I will arise I and I not no I and when the eye man hit him so he get hit down with ey he got the boots and he got kicked out pride is a deadly thing you know Nicodemus was coming by Night know because he didn't want to be seen any day Pride but when that man daughter was dying and he brother with anybody else you know he know Jesus on a different Road all together he said my master master my daughter somebody said better to ask him she dead now she has died now she's dead and Jesus turned and says you see what what is he in different realm he said I go weaker when Lazarus died what did Jesus say I'm glad for my sake I was not there he knew what he was going to do [Applause] he's in the spirit are you in the spirit let's up Mission come up please but Brandon I was quoting something ago and one of the services a little boy that I knew of in a certain city who was climbing around in the Attic he found a little old attic a Garett old trunk digging to the trunk he found a little yellow posted stamp it was a yellow from age he taken it over to the stamp collecting friend and he said said how much will you give me for this stamp he was expecting 5 or 10 cents and perhaps an ice cream core in his mind he looked it over the collector he knew it was valuable stamp he said I'll give you a dollar bill for it that was a good quick sale for the little lad he collected a dollar the stamp collection taken the stamp down the street he went for ice cream the stamp collector began to work on the stamp a few weeks later he sold it for $500 then a little after that it was sold for 3,000 and they say it's worth a quarter of a million dollar you see it wasn't the little yellow paper because you wouldn't even have picked it up if it was on the street but what made it so valuable was what was root on that little yellow paper and that's the way it is tonight it's just a piece of paper not very valuable paper but it's what's wrote in it have so much value because it is the word of God and Heaven will pass away but that word will never pass away a man is just as good as his word you are just as good as your word I am just as good as my word if I can't take your word I want no dealings with you I want you to be the same to me and we must be the same to God if he can keep his word then I want to know who is God that can keep his word so he said have faith in God faith is a common thing like we reads like like his up you try to press it out make it something that no one can take a hold of it's so simple but BR God humbles himself God is humility what say the first sign of the Holy Ghost first not second not third not fourth the first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility somebody who's willing to Humble themselves somebody will to say I'm wrong I'm sorry the man that can humble himself is on his Road up he that exalts himself is on the road down that groups of Pastor Elder Deacon regardless of who it is you see somebody proud and arrogant they're on their way down regardless of what status they have they could have the best in pool house land car plane whatever they're on their way down the one who humble themselves they're on the way up we must remember that Christianity is not pushing ahead trying to get ahead of this fellow but stepping back taking the backseat let the other fellow go humble yourself if they sue you at the court take your coat give them the cloak also if they compel you to go a mile go two smash you One Cheek turn the other he was our example in every way that we should be brandham he decided to took blood Adam and Eve tried to make a fig Leaf apron it wouldn't do required blood blood and he said now watch and he will never change he never changes and when it come a time a person was sick and wanted to be healed by God God healed them on the same basis in faith I'm almost done and any word that God says here we go it can never change now that's the reason I believe the Bible is just the way it's written it can never be changed we can't find nothing better God cannot he's infinite we are finite we make mistakes and tomorrow we know that we know today more than we know today but not God he's Eternal infinite omnipotent omnipresent omnicient he is God if he isn't those things then he isn't God he's finite like we are so we must remember he is God his words are and that's part of him you've heard me say every man is good at his word God is no better than his word so in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God last quot you see the attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word formed body the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of mzc then later we never heard no more mzc because he become Jesus Christ melz was a priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things but you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you became from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthy Tac could be dissolved we have one already waiting that is where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we have done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we just become flesh man not the word but but look clearly it makes it clear you will never be the word unless you were the thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you were a thought you have to be in his thinking so if you have to believe tonight that you are part of this bright body you have to believe you are part of God's thinking that is why you connect with this word you see in order to stand Temptation you have to bypass theophany you have to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin Oh Glory to God you byass it off and become a flesh man to be tempted by sin Oh Glory to God hallelujah but when this body received the spirit of God the immortal Immortal Life inside of you it CHS this body in subjection hallelujah hallelujah there you are it CHS your body in subjection you don't have to say if I could quit drinking if I could quit this just get into Christ and it's gone because your body is subject to that Spirit let's all stand and give go praise to God Jesus pay it all oh to him
