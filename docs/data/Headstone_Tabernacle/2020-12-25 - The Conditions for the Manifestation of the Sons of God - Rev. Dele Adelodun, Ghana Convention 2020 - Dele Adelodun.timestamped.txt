[28:02] and confirmed you into his own image he
[28:06] already have seen you adopted praise god
[28:09] a man
[28:10] and adoption abduction is to take place

[28:17] adoption
[28:17] time somebody say man praise god amen

[28:35] our ministry we speak out only when we
[28:38] need the holy ghost in the power
[28:42] and adoption god will adopt us do you
[28:45] believe that
[28:47] amen and this is just the main thing
[28:51] more especially at this time the whole
[28:53] world is falling apart
[28:55] and people are doing all kinds of things
[28:57] but god is gathering his people
[29:00] the bride is moving on the church of the
[29:01] living god we still move on
[29:03] in the midst of all these pestilences in
[29:05] the midst of all these demoralizations
[29:08] in the midst whereby the enemy thought
[29:10] that he got everything god is still
[29:12] moving in his power
[29:14] and leading his church ahead praise god
[29:16] a man
[29:17] and therefore we thank god for malachi 4
[29:19] we thank god because the mechanics
[29:22] he brought us the mechanics and the
[29:23] dynamics together
[29:25] hallelujah and the mechanics and the
[29:28] dynamics together
[29:29] they are here to bring us
[29:32] again into the perfect state
[29:35] that god has predestinated us to and
[29:38] that's
[29:39] into our adoption our placing somebody
[29:42] say man
[29:43] therefore we need to just learn to
[29:45] understand
[29:46] that the hour we are living in uh
[29:49] brother abraham said here in the message
[29:50] recognizing your
[29:52] day and and his message he says here

[30:09] we are resting on that
[30:11] what recognize the day that we are
[30:14] living
[30:15] the time we are living the sign of the
[30:18] time
[30:18] that we are living in it may be
[30:22] lighter than we think one of these days
[30:25] let him that is outside stay outside and
[30:28] steal
[30:28] and he that is inside must ever be
[30:32] inside still
[30:33] the door we close praise god amen
[30:37] and then he says again if there is some

[34:55] if you have your bibles with you please
[34:57] turn with me to the book of ephesians
[35:00] chapter one
[35:02] ephesians chapter 1 i'm reading the
[35:05] first 14 verses
[35:09] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[35:12] will of god
[35:13] to the saints which at ephesus and to
[35:16] the faithful
[35:17] in christ jesus grace be to you
[35:21] and peace from god our father
[35:24] and from the lord jesus christ
[35:27] blessed be the god and father of our
[35:30] lord jesus christ
[35:31] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[35:34] blessings
[35:36] in heavenly places in christ according
[35:39] as he has chosen us in him
[35:41] before the foundation of the world that
[35:44] we should be
[35:44] holy and without blame before him in
[35:48] love
[35:48] having predestinated us unto the
[35:52] adoption of
[35:53] children by jesus christ
[35:58] to himself according to the good
[36:01] pleasure
[36:02] of his will to the praise of the glory
[36:06] of his grace wherein he had made us
[36:09] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[36:13] redemption through his blood
[36:16] uh the forgiveness of sins
[36:19] according to the riches of his grace
[36:22] wearing yet abandoned
[36:24] towards us in all wisdom and prudence
[36:27] having made known unto us the mystery of
[36:30] his will
[36:31] according to his good pleasure which he
[36:34] had proposed in himself
[36:36] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[36:40] of time he might gather together in one
[36:43] all things in christ in christ
[36:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[36:49] on earth
[36:50] even in him in whom also we have
[36:53] obtained an inheritance
[36:55] been predestinated according to the
[36:57] purpose of
[36:58] him who work at all things after the
[37:01] council of his own will
[37:04] amen that we should be to the praise of
[37:07] his glory
[37:09] who first trusted in christ in whom he
[37:12] also trusted after that he heard
[37:16] the word of truth the gospel of your
[37:18] salvation
[37:20] in whom also after that he believed he
[37:23] was sealed
[37:24] without holy spirit of promise which is
[37:27] the earnest of our inheritance
[37:29] until the redemption of the purchased
[37:32] possession
[37:33] unto the praise of his glory
[37:37] amen romans chapter 8.
[37:55] i'd like to take from verse 18 to
[37:58] 23 for i reckon
[38:02] that the sufferings of this present time
[38:06] are not worthy to be compared with the
[38:09] glory
[38:10] which shall be revealed in horse for the
[38:13] harnessed
[38:14] expectation of the creature we touched
[38:17] for
[38:18] the manifestation of the sons of
[38:21] god for the creator was made subject to
[38:24] vanity
[38:26] not willingly but by reason of him
[38:30] who had subjected the same in hope
[38:33] because the creature itself also shall
[38:36] be delivered
[38:37] from the bondage of corruption into the
[38:40] glorious liberty
[38:41] of the children of god for we know
[38:45] that the whole creation grown age and
[38:47] travelled
[38:48] in pain together until now and not
[38:52] only they but ourselves also amen
[38:58] which are the first fruits of the spirit
[39:01] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[39:05] waiting for the adoption to which the
[39:08] redemption
[39:09] of our body may the lord add his
[39:12] blessings
[39:13] to the reading of his holy word
[39:16] god bless you
[39:20] i would like to appreciate her
[39:24] the host pastor for
[39:28] this privilege he has given unto me
[39:31] to come and be of service to god's
[39:34] people
[39:35] believing god that somewhere along the
[39:38] line
[39:39] we can be of a blessing we don't know
[39:42] how far
[39:43] those sermons could go
[39:47] but we want to do our very best
[39:52] to reach out to the source of god and to
[39:55] be honest
[39:56] about everything we'll say so that we
[39:59] can be a blessing
[40:00] to the body of christ all that has been
[40:03] put in
[40:04] may the lord bless it very much and that
[40:07] to his glory
[40:08] god bless every one of you in the name
[40:11] of jesus christ
[40:15] i would like to depending on what side
[40:19] of the world you are
[40:20] it could be morning it could be evening
[40:23] it could be afternoon whatever
[40:27] but this time i would like to speak on
[40:30] the subject
[40:32] in line with the thoughts of the program
[40:36] which speaks on the manifestation
[40:39] of the sons of god amen
[40:43] but i would rather speak on this the
[40:46] condition
[40:47] for this manifestation
[40:51] the condition for the manifestations of
[40:54] the sons of god
[40:56] amen
[41:00] the prophets
[41:07] in the message a fundamental
[41:12] foundation of our faith was
[41:16] telling the church why god brought
[41:19] us here and it is important that we know
[41:24] why we are here and what he has brought
[41:27] us here for
[41:29] and by this will know what our purpose
[41:33] is to achieve i'd like to read that for
[41:35] a background
[41:36] this morning as we look at this subject
[41:40] because i'm going to approach it uh
[41:43] in a different way you know
[41:46] many times we talk about people
[41:49] manifesting
[41:50] the power of god the glory of god
[41:53] those things will come the scripture
[41:57] already told us that this is what we are
[42:01] predestinated for
[42:04] he said we are predestinated unto
[42:07] adoption amen
[42:10] and i tell you friends we shall be
[42:14] adopted
[42:17] but these things must come by way god
[42:19] has designed it
[42:22] any man who will be adopted must first
[42:25] found
[42:26] the land where adoption is possible
[42:30] amen because it is not on every ground
[42:33] that you can be adopted
[42:37] then you must also have a witness in
[42:39] your arch
[42:41] that you are a son you must know who you
[42:45] are
[42:46] if you don't have an identity it becomes
[42:49] very difficult to know
[42:52] how to be pleased so you and i
[42:56] must know who we are first amen
[43:00] and then knowing who we are we must know
[43:03] the family we belong to
[43:06] because no family the kind of
[43:09] adoption we are talking about does not
[43:12] happen
[43:13] in a family where you do not belong
[43:17] as a son
[43:20] you must first be born into that family
[43:23] i know families do adopt children
[43:27] that they never give birth to that is
[43:30] one side
[43:31] but that is not the kind of adoption we
[43:33] are talking about this morning
[43:36] we are talking about a child being born
[43:39] in a house amen and that child
[43:43] being placed into his position of
[43:46] inheritance
[43:49] by the law of inheritance according to
[43:53] the scriptures
[43:54] you can never enjoy permanently and
[43:57] inheritance if you are not connected by
[44:01] blood
[44:05] meaning that somebody from another
[44:08] family line another bloodline completely
[44:12] can never inherit you the only person
[44:16] who can inherit you
[44:18] is a child born connected
[44:21] to your gene into your blood
[44:25] outside of that there is no inheritance
[44:29] and the inheritance i'm talking about
[44:31] here
[44:33] has to do with your blessing
[44:36] you might be a child in a family
[44:40] and your worth and your value
[44:43] is not better than that of a servant
[44:49] the scripture says so he said
[44:52] a child of a family is not better
[44:55] than a servant until he comes into his
[44:58] inheritance
[45:00] amen and before you can come
[45:03] into your inheritance you must undergo
[45:06] some processes
[45:09] amen and those are the process of
[45:12] growth when you come to a level of
[45:15] growth a level of conduct a level of
[45:19] maturity
[45:20] you have been prepared for your watch
[45:22] for your blessing
[45:24] when you become placed you come into an
[45:27] inheritance
[45:28] that is as good even the prophet used
[45:31] the word
[45:31] co-equal with your father
[45:36] and from that moment you can begin to
[45:39] enjoy
[45:40] expand your inheritances
[45:44] so it is a child born into a family
[45:48] connected to that family by blood that
[45:51] i'm talking about this morning
[45:53] so i'm saying before you can be adopted
[45:57] you must find the land of adoption
[46:02] there are so many churches on edge today
[46:05] claiming to be the way
[46:08] but god does not give honor to a ground
[46:12] where his name is not pleased
[46:16] and from the scriptures god has always
[46:19] had a chosen place
[46:22] where he put his name the prophet said
[46:26] his name
[46:27] is not on every wall amen
[46:30] god has always had a unified rallying
[46:33] position
[46:34] where his children bring their
[46:36] sacrifices otherwise
[46:38] they will not be accepted
[46:42] so you and i must find that ground
[46:45] amen because the material to
[46:48] prepare us to mature us for our adoption
[46:52] can only be found on that ground that is
[46:55] why today
[46:56] it is no use for you enjoying
[46:59] pentecostal carry-ons
[47:01] they will never bring you to adoption
[47:04] you will never manifest
[47:06] anything you can demonstrate counterfeit
[47:09] but adoption the blessing into
[47:12] inheritance
[47:13] is beyond pentecostalism
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:17] it is beyond wesley it is beyond
[47:21] looter amen
[47:25] the people who live in outer court
[47:29] will never come to adoption amen
[47:33] out of court fellowship i'm just running
[47:35] times for you
[47:37] outer court fellowship because
[47:38] everything god did in times
[47:40] shadows he has used it to explain only
[47:43] one thing
[47:44] and that is redemption amen
[47:47] in the tabernacle in the wilderness it
[47:49] gave them a tabernacle and
[47:52] in this tabernacle it divided it into
[47:55] three sections
[47:56] amen he said the first section is the
[47:59] outer court
[48:00] where it's available to everybody
[48:04] anybody can come in there and the
[48:07] experience
[48:08] in the after court is not actually an
[48:11] absolute experience are you following me
[48:14] amen it is for every tom dick and harry
[48:18] because why they live under in that
[48:22] outer court
[48:23] they live under the conditions of the
[48:26] elements
[48:28] natural elements of weather which
[48:31] as a twist and return all the time
[48:36] when people progress they come into the
[48:39] middle court
[48:41] which is a better protection amen
[48:45] because you are not at the mercy of
[48:47] sunlight you are not at the mercy of a
[48:50] rain you are not at the mercy of the
[48:52] wind you have come
[48:54] under a bit of a protection but the
[48:57] experience there
[48:58] is also not absolutely
[49:03] you cannot make a perfect christian in
[49:05] those regions
[49:07] amen time will fail me to break that
[49:10] down
[49:12] but a man who lives in outer court is
[49:15] only believing
[49:16] to being a christian he's not just a
[49:19] christian
[49:20] amen he might have been justified he
[49:23] might have repented
[49:24] but the root of sin that makes him a
[49:28] sinner
[49:28] is still there
[49:32] so every now and then is susceptible
[49:36] to all manner of life amen
[49:40] and we need to expand on this
[49:43] so that you see the journey into
[49:46] manifestation
[49:48] we talked about manifestation and
[49:50] everybody is looking forward to it
[49:52] we should look forward to it because the
[49:55] scripture
[49:56] in prophecy had already told us that
[49:59] nature we groan for each
[50:02] you know why nature is groaning because
[50:05] nature has seen
[50:06] a great blessing before they've seen
[50:09] original before they knew what god
[50:12] brought you an eye for and they saw it
[50:15] demonstrated
[50:17] through a man called adam and nature
[50:20] even beyond man knew those things were
[50:23] the truth
[50:26] some of us could doubt it but the trees
[50:29] don't doubt it
[50:31] some of us could disbelieve it but the
[50:34] waters the seas don't disbelieve it
[50:37] because these things happened in their
[50:39] presence
[50:40] they saw a son of god in the glory of
[50:43] the son of god
[50:44] they saw him demonstrating his
[50:46] inheritance
[50:48] they saw him acted as governor of this
[50:51] earth
[50:53] they saw god say i will stay there and
[50:55] he will stay here
[50:57] and they saw they saw the meaning of god
[51:00] giving
[51:01] adam the church of everything
[51:05] they want to see that again
[51:08] and by the scriptures they will see it
[51:11] again
[51:13] hallelujah because every now and then
[51:17] god has true types and shadows true
[51:19] manifestation
[51:20] proving that those things are possible
[51:24] if we do not manifest those things our
[51:27] purpose is defeated
[51:31] because the prophet doesn't look like i
[51:34] have enough patience to read from the
[51:36] code but let me say what the quote says
[51:38] the prophet said what did god brought
[51:41] man here for
[51:43] amen he said he brought you and i here
[51:47] to control to take charge
[51:50] and to govern this urge
[51:53] hallelujah and how do we do it
[51:57] we must look for how adam did it
[52:00] adam exercise jurisdiction and perfect
[52:03] control over this earth
[52:05] through just the spoken words let me
[52:08] tell you the word of god is powerful
[52:12] and it is still powerful and it is still
[52:15] in force
[52:17] how do i know the bible said the frames
[52:20] of this earth
[52:22] is held together by watch the word of
[52:25] god
[52:26] as the frame collapsed as the earth
[52:29] collapsed
[52:31] as long as the earth is standing the
[52:34] word of god is standing
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:37] as long as the earth is standing the
[52:39] word of god is in effect
[52:41] and that tells you and hi we can stand
[52:44] upon that watch
[52:46] and claim our promises we can stand upon
[52:49] that word
[52:50] and say god you said and the one who
[52:53] spoke must respond back
[53:00] adam was here living
[53:03] as the son of god
[53:06] i will read some few things
[53:10] and you will appreciate some certain
[53:11] things adam was here
[53:14] living as what son of god
[53:18] the meaning of sonship
[53:22] is that i have my replica
[53:28] showing that god has his own because
[53:31] what makes christ a son was because he
[53:34] came
[53:35] out of god are you here church
[53:39] and what will make you a son is because
[53:42] you came from god
[53:46] and that is why the prophet could make a
[53:48] powerful statement
[53:50] that even the new birth is not what
[53:53] makes you a son of god
[53:57] did you ever think about that your new
[53:59] birth did not make you a son
[54:02] amen you were a son before you were born
[54:05] again
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:07] it was your sonship that makes it
[54:10] compulsory
[54:12] for god to give you the new birth
[54:15] [Applause]
[54:17] if you were not a son you cannot be born
[54:20] again
[54:22] only sons can be born again
[54:25] and what makes you a son is because you
[54:28] came from god you were a reproduction
[54:32] of god's own genes
[54:38] i went into genetics the other time amen
[54:42] you will watch a reproduction of god's
[54:46] gene
[54:47] and what that means is this
[54:51] if they want to test a paternity
[54:54] still today the best formula for testing
[54:58] is to is an averse of your dream
[55:04] because it is medically or
[55:06] scientifically proven
[55:08] that the gene of a man
[55:12] it's only unique to a man
[55:16] and it can only be replicated
[55:21] through his own offspring
[55:26] are you following me meaning that
[55:30] if a paternity if a child's paternity
[55:33] is in dispute the best settler
[55:37] is to run what they call a dna amen
[55:41] and this dna is a chemical
[55:44] test upon the gene of the young boy
[55:48] and the uh as you call them
[55:52] the prospective fathers
[55:55] or the contending fathers it doesn't
[55:58] matter whether they are 10 or 15 or 20
[56:01] men
[56:02] that are laying claim to one boy
[56:05] this boy cannot have features
[56:10] that the 20 that even two men
[56:15] can okay let me put it like this this
[56:17] boy cannot have features
[56:19] that will be similar to two men
[56:22] not to talk of 10 or 20 the features it
[56:26] will demonstrate
[56:28] will only be traceable to only one
[56:30] person
[56:32] [Applause]
[56:37] so if god calls you his child his son
[56:40] it shows that you have a tresebugin
[56:46] are you here church your gene your
[56:49] characteristics
[56:50] your features your mannerisms your
[56:53] actions
[56:54] everything about you can be traceable to
[56:57] god
[57:00] but then why do you need the new birth
[57:08] if you were born a son
[57:11] because the bible spoke about
[57:12] predestination here
[57:14] is that he has predestinated us unto
[57:17] adoption isn't it
[57:19] and only a son can be adopted
[57:24] i've differentiated from the modern day
[57:26] adoption for you is that right
[57:28] only a son can be meaning that only a
[57:31] son can be placed into
[57:33] his inheritance
[57:41] so if you are predestined a church
[57:44] it follows that you must bring forth the
[57:46] characteristics of your predestination
[57:50] are you getting it you must give the
[57:52] proof you must give the evidence
[57:54] you must give the testimony that this is
[57:57] my predestination
[57:59] amen sometimes the way we explain this
[58:02] predestination we make people to become
[58:05] complacent
[58:07] no sir we make people to live anyhow
[58:10] life
[58:11] if you were truly ordained you will
[58:13] bring forth the fruit of ordination
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:18] amen because christianity through
[58:22] christianity
[58:23] the prophet said it's a life that cannot
[58:26] be mimicked
[58:28] it is either there or not but
[58:31] if it is there it will speak out
[58:36] amen so these genes are already coded
[58:39] in you but something must bring them to
[58:43] life
[58:44] [Music]
[58:45] what brings your genetic characteristics
[58:48] to life
[58:49] is called the new best
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:55] this is why the prophet said eat less
[58:58] damage
[58:58] and why would you need the new birth
[59:04] because your natural birth
[59:08] even though permitted for all of us to
[59:11] come
[59:14] was not god's perfect will
[59:18] and it wasn't god's own divine
[59:21] prescription
[59:22] amen it was first practiced
[59:25] by the devil the your natural
[59:29] breath was a process for the devil to
[59:32] inject
[59:33] his nature into you
[59:36] and that is why king david said it was
[59:38] born in sin
[59:39] which you were also born in sin i was
[59:42] born in sin
[59:43] we were all shaped in iniquity we came
[59:46] to the world speaking what
[59:48] lies are you here church
[59:52] we are speaking lies when nobody taught
[59:54] us how to lie
[59:57] it doesn't matter where you were born
[59:59] you may be born in the house of a pastor
[1:00:02] you might be born in the palace of
[1:00:03] lawyers amen
[1:00:05] your first birth was a breath of defeat
[1:00:10] because the formula for your
[1:00:12] reproduction
[1:00:13] belong to the devil it's a breath of
[1:00:17] death it's a breath of darkness
[1:00:24] this is the reason that what makes sense
[1:00:26] you must be born again
[1:00:29] so god acknowledged that you have been
[1:00:32] born
[1:00:32] but you need to be reburned
[1:00:37] and your rebirth will do what will put
[1:00:40] death to that nature and bring a
[1:00:42] quickening to the gene
[1:00:44] of god in you then you can truly say
[1:00:47] if any man be in christ he is what
[1:00:50] a new creator all things have passed
[1:00:54] away
[1:00:55] behold all things have become
[1:00:58] new
[1:01:04] that new birth is not available outside
[1:01:06] today
[1:01:08] it's only available in the land of
[1:01:10] adoption
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:14] some folks do say well i could be born
[1:01:18] again
[1:01:18] outside i don't fight
[1:01:22] but if you are truly born again outside
[1:01:24] of the review what for your day
[1:01:26] and you stay still in the denominations
[1:01:31] and eating all those dead things i doubt
[1:01:34] your new birth
[1:01:37] and it's pure simple scripture on the
[1:01:40] day of pentecost
[1:01:42] i know the characteristics of the holy
[1:01:44] ghost
[1:01:46] there were a lot of people who came from
[1:01:48] everywhere amen
[1:01:52] men of galilee men of judea men of these
[1:01:55] men of death
[1:01:56] they all had one thing in common to call
[1:01:59] the thing of god something vile
[1:02:03] but friends it was the day of mercy
[1:02:06] so what did god do god raised the man
[1:02:09] called peter
[1:02:11] fresh under the unction and the
[1:02:13] anointing
[1:02:14] and baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:17] and he told them men and brethren look
[1:02:19] at the time of the day
[1:02:21] not badly reasonable nobody saying get
[1:02:24] drunk at a time like this
[1:02:26] but this is that
[1:02:29] amen this is the fulfillment of prophecy
[1:02:33] this is the bringing to pass of dossier
[1:02:36] the lord
[1:02:38] and by the time he was able to place
[1:02:40] that
[1:02:41] experience in the word of god it created
[1:02:44] an hunger
[1:02:47] men and brethren what shall we do don't
[1:02:50] forget they came from different
[1:02:52] backgrounds
[1:02:53] they came from different denominations
[1:02:56] but when they were told what to do
[1:02:59] repent
[1:03:00] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:03:02] christ
[1:03:03] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:03:05] shall receive the holy ghost
[1:03:07] and they receive the holy ghost the
[1:03:10] bible told me
[1:03:11] it gave them a turnaround it
[1:03:14] changed their apertures when you receive
[1:03:18] the holy ghost it will change your
[1:03:20] appetite
[1:03:23] you will drop trinity amen you won't sit
[1:03:26] still under a woman preacher
[1:03:29] if you are still doing that you are not
[1:03:31] born again
[1:03:32] because it is a complete negation of the
[1:03:35] wage
[1:03:40] it changed the appetite of these folks
[1:03:43] you say how do you know preacher
[1:03:45] the bible said instead of going back to
[1:03:47] where they came from
[1:03:50] read your bible acts chapter 2 they
[1:03:52] continued
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:56] amen meaning they started in pentecost
[1:04:00] with their repentance with their water
[1:04:03] baptism
[1:04:04] and with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:06] and after that what happened
[1:04:08] they continued they did not only just
[1:04:11] continued
[1:04:12] they didn't continue on seriously they
[1:04:15] don't go to church today and not come
[1:04:17] tomorrow
[1:04:18] it was settled in their heart they are
[1:04:20] not listening to that message
[1:04:22] of their day and comparing it with td
[1:04:25] jacks
[1:04:27] some of you are not born again yet
[1:04:30] because the message of the hour has not
[1:04:32] been revealed to you
[1:04:34] you say i listen to this and i listen to
[1:04:36] this and i listen to that
[1:04:38] to do a comparison you've not received
[1:04:40] the holy spirit
[1:04:42] if you receive the holy spirit it
[1:04:44] changes your
[1:04:45] appetites
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:50] sometimes i don't blame you amen
[1:04:53] i blame the preachers who are starving
[1:04:55] you
[1:04:56] who will not bring you to the knowledge
[1:04:58] of the truth
[1:05:00] the prophet said if you starve a child
[1:05:02] it will go to the garbage cans
[1:05:08] but this wasn't the witness of pentecost
[1:05:11] if you like say i'm only defending the
[1:05:13] message what am i restful
[1:05:16] i have found my own purpose in life
[1:05:19] amen allow me to generously declare my
[1:05:22] purpose
[1:05:23] i am raised for the defense of the
[1:05:25] gospel
[1:05:27] not a denominational gospel the purest
[1:05:30] gospel
[1:05:32] the world they call heresy so worship
[1:05:35] i the god of my fathers
[1:05:41] there has got to be a land where
[1:05:43] adoption is possible
[1:05:45] [Applause]
[1:05:48] am i still preaching the scriptures they
[1:05:51] continued steadfastly
[1:05:55] oh hallelujah in what in apostles
[1:05:59] doctrine hey hey the pharisees doctrine
[1:06:02] was also there
[1:06:03] the sadducees were there the sahendra
[1:06:06] the council
[1:06:07] the scribes the herodias and thousands
[1:06:11] more denomination
[1:06:12] it was it isn't anything new it has
[1:06:15] always been there
[1:06:17] just changing into different names and
[1:06:18] flavors
[1:06:20] but these guys amen and it was not a
[1:06:24] little crowd
[1:06:25] it was a great crowd a crowd from among
[1:06:28] three thousand people we are baptized
[1:06:32] friends i baptized 40 something people
[1:06:36] at the time
[1:06:37] my muscle my rib muscle was tight for
[1:06:40] two weeks
[1:06:41] but here we are talking about 30 000
[1:06:44] souls
[1:06:46] you can imagine the crowd at pentecost
[1:06:50] you can imagine that they will come from
[1:06:52] different backgrounds
[1:06:54] but these three thousand souls continued
[1:07:01] seriously committedly
[1:07:05] holy without looking right
[1:07:08] without looking left without being
[1:07:11] without lingering between two
[1:07:13] opinions
[1:07:17] this holy ghost will move from body to
[1:07:19] body
[1:07:21] its characteristics its behavior
[1:07:24] its appetite will remain the same
[1:07:29] if you cannot put your experience back
[1:07:31] to the world
[1:07:32] is a counterfeit experience
[1:07:38] they continued steadfastly in apostle's
[1:07:42] doctrine
[1:07:44] in fellowship and in breaking of bridge
[1:07:47] and the lord begin to hatch to them i
[1:07:50] like this life
[1:07:51] not just anyhow people souls
[1:07:55] such as should be saved
[1:07:58] because it's an entire work of
[1:08:00] predestination
[1:08:02] the truth is this friends you don't
[1:08:04] stray into the message
[1:08:11] you may think it's a strain nobody stray
[1:08:14] into the message it is the lord who
[1:08:17] calls you
[1:08:19] he calls you by his watch by his
[1:08:22] election
[1:08:23] hallelujah the prophet and the message
[1:08:26] spiritual food in due season
[1:08:28] he said if you don't come like that he
[1:08:30] wondered how you got in
[1:08:38] you love him this morning
[1:08:41] so coming back to that tabernacle in the
[1:08:45] wilderness again
[1:08:47] the men from justification amen
[1:08:51] under the elements it came under a place
[1:08:54] where they called the middle court
[1:08:56] where there is some sort of protection
[1:09:00] but don't forget even though there is
[1:09:02] protection
[1:09:03] the people who live in there live
[1:09:06] under the light of a candlestick
[1:09:12] this candlestick or what you call a lamp
[1:09:14] needs
[1:09:15] constant maintenance you have to be
[1:09:18] pouring oil
[1:09:19] you have to be cleaning the week because
[1:09:22] of carbonizing
[1:09:24] if you don't do constant monitoring and
[1:09:26] maintenance you are going to create a
[1:09:28] problem
[1:09:30] amen because the lamp you live by
[1:09:33] is still a man-made light
[1:09:37] so the experience has gone far but it is
[1:09:40] not
[1:09:40] absolute this is where
[1:09:44] many people arrived in they call it
[1:09:46] sanctification
[1:09:48] and they can do so nice so well
[1:09:52] and if possible equate that for the new
[1:09:55] birth
[1:09:55] experience but friends don't trust it
[1:09:59] still
[1:10:00] because even though you are sanctified
[1:10:04] you are only cleansed and set aside for
[1:10:07] service
[1:10:08] what makes you a sinner with you all of
[1:10:10] my mouth
[1:10:11] i still say is still there
[1:10:15] that snake that's happened that old
[1:10:18] nature
[1:10:19] that root of sin is still there
[1:10:23] but you know what you've done you've
[1:10:25] blocked contact
[1:10:27] you've pruned you've pruned this
[1:10:28] connection so you can live
[1:10:30] nice as long as there is no pressure you
[1:10:33] are like a
[1:10:35] vulture putting on a peacock experience
[1:10:38] amen you know if these things do not
[1:10:41] come from you
[1:10:44] a vulture can never have the feather of
[1:10:46] a peacock
[1:10:48] is it possible normally it's not
[1:10:50] possible
[1:10:52] but if he wants and so desire he can get
[1:10:55] some
[1:10:56] now he cannot grow it but you can attach
[1:10:59] it
[1:11:00] hallelujah attachments can last a long
[1:11:03] while
[1:11:04] but let me tell you the gum of
[1:11:05] attachment will expire sometime
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:10] so you need constant maintenance to look
[1:11:13] like who you are not
[1:11:16] are you catching it even those who do
[1:11:19] make ups you see how they constantly
[1:11:22] they have to they make up in the morning
[1:11:24] at night they are removing
[1:11:26] it and doing makeup remover when you see
[1:11:28] their table
[1:11:29] they have all set of chemicals
[1:11:34] for what for constant maintenance
[1:11:38] because the way they were trying to look
[1:11:41] is not exactly how they are
[1:11:43] nature cannot bring it out in them and
[1:11:46] that is why it is called cosmetic
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:52] padding
[1:11:54] i hope you are not becoming cosmetics
[1:11:57] amen because when there is so much
[1:12:00] artificial on the outside
[1:12:01] it speaks of the inside oh glory to god
[1:12:07] people don't like this kind of gospel
[1:12:09] but you want to manifest the sons of god
[1:12:12] amen you think you can bribe god with
[1:12:14] your a's and ooze and that
[1:12:17] amen the only emotion god knows is his
[1:12:20] wedge
[1:12:22] outside of the world forget it that is
[1:12:26] why today we have become more bluffers
[1:12:30] than genuine men we make so much claims
[1:12:33] and there seems to be no life to back it
[1:12:35] off
[1:12:37] it has become a cosmetic religion
[1:12:42] are you enjoying the lord friends you've
[1:12:44] got to enjoy the lord
[1:12:45] it's his words amen all right
[1:12:49] then but when that man
[1:12:52] is able to move from the middle couch
[1:12:56] hallelujah and come into the holiest of
[1:13:00] the holies
[1:13:02] it is at that point the prophet said
[1:13:05] the world is actually shot out
[1:13:10] and he himself is shot inside
[1:13:14] in another description in the future
[1:13:17] home
[1:13:18] message the prophet said what happens at
[1:13:21] that stage
[1:13:22] is that the spirit of the lord is ready
[1:13:24] to come
[1:13:26] but before it comes it must it must
[1:13:29] clean the old house
[1:13:31] amen and your spirit that has been
[1:13:34] used to the influence and control
[1:13:37] of that mean nature must be what must be
[1:13:40] renewed
[1:13:42] did you hear the scripture talk about
[1:13:44] mind renewal
[1:13:46] amen be transformed by what the renewal
[1:13:49] of your mind
[1:13:52] a new heart and a new spirit god is not
[1:13:55] going to bring another
[1:13:56] amen even when you use the word another
[1:14:00] is to tell you the cleansing and the
[1:14:02] renewal
[1:14:03] your spirit will undergo and
[1:14:06] the prophet the review what explained
[1:14:08] that and it said in the message future
[1:14:11] oh
[1:14:12] what happens is that when the spirit of
[1:14:14] the lord does comes
[1:14:15] it comes with fire baptism
[1:14:19] it is in line with god's entire program
[1:14:22] church
[1:14:23] before the city that john saw coming
[1:14:26] down
[1:14:27] the first quarter city that will take
[1:14:29] the center stage
[1:14:30] on the earth where christ will rule
[1:14:34] and reign from before it can come
[1:14:37] this earth must be renovated
[1:14:40] the renovation of earth is going to be
[1:14:43] by fire
[1:14:44] and the prophet said the way god is
[1:14:46] redeeming the earth
[1:14:48] is the same way as redeeming you that is
[1:14:50] going to live in that heart
[1:14:54] hallelujah
[1:14:58] because when heaven and earth meet
[1:15:00] together
[1:15:01] there must be a perfect match we are
[1:15:04] waiting for the city
[1:15:05] that john saw coming down that city
[1:15:08] is our child it's our reflection
[1:15:12] is who we are we must look the same
[1:15:15] is a prepared city for a prepared people
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:22] in the same way this earth is being
[1:15:25] renovated for that city
[1:15:27] is the same way you are being renovated
[1:15:29] after all the scripture told me
[1:15:31] ye are the temple of the living god
[1:15:35] as in the health got in his
[1:15:36] justification he got his justification
[1:15:40] he's been baptized in the days of noah
[1:15:43] he got his sanctification by the
[1:15:45] shedding of the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:48] but sin and contamination is still here
[1:15:51] even though the earth has been
[1:15:52] sanctified
[1:15:53] are you seeing the type but i tell you
[1:15:55] one of these days
[1:15:57] there will be no sin there will be no
[1:15:59] contamination
[1:16:01] there will be no virus whether corona or
[1:16:04] not
[1:16:06] there will be no one there will be no
[1:16:08] one gem
[1:16:09] they will never stretch we shall live on
[1:16:12] this earth
[1:16:13] because the bible said there will be
[1:16:16] nothing that we hurt
[1:16:17] or destroy in all my holy mountains
[1:16:21] for god to guarantee that he gave us a
[1:16:24] promise
[1:16:26] this earth will be renovated by the
[1:16:28] baptism of fire
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:32] that is what you call hell fire
[1:16:35] [Laughter]
[1:16:37] that's what you call one hell fire lake
[1:16:40] of fire
[1:16:41] amen lake of fire is not going to exist
[1:16:45] side by side with you in eternity there
[1:16:48] is no scripture for that
[1:16:50] no revelation of the word for that
[1:16:53] god is going to camp the believers upon
[1:16:56] the breath of the earth
[1:16:58] and he's going to send a fire baptism
[1:17:00] upon this earth
[1:17:02] i don't know for how many years it's
[1:17:03] going to burn
[1:17:05] but it will be burnt for as long as a
[1:17:08] renovation is necessary
[1:17:10] so that everything unclean will be wiped
[1:17:14] out
[1:17:16] and when the whole wiping is done the
[1:17:18] earth is ready to receive
[1:17:21] the city that is the way god wipes your
[1:17:24] heart
[1:17:25] amen it burns it and neither leaves
[1:17:28] roots nor branch everything is wiped out
[1:17:32] hallelujah sin can no longer to come to
[1:17:36] you by
[1:17:36] desire amen it can come by
[1:17:39] sight appeal but there is no desire of
[1:17:43] sin in you
[1:17:45] this is what god does amen in order to
[1:17:48] set your mind ready
[1:17:50] for the new householder
[1:17:56] so when you have the baptism of the fire
[1:17:59] you receive the holy spirit
[1:18:01] and what does the holy spirit does the
[1:18:04] prophet said it strikes your seed
[1:18:07] your dream comes alive amen
[1:18:11] your soul comes alive and you become if
[1:18:14] any man be in christ
[1:18:16] he is watched all things have
[1:18:20] passed out beyond all things have become
[1:18:23] new
[1:18:24] you become a new man in christ amen
[1:18:28] you become settled no more
[1:18:31] true opinions you only want one thing
[1:18:35] and that is the word or nothing else
[1:18:39] in all your actions your thoughts your
[1:18:41] idea no longer matters
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:49] what did you find by that you found
[1:18:52] the land where adoption is possible
[1:18:59] let me tell you the new birth
[1:19:03] takes place only in the message
[1:19:08] the new bed like we know the new bed
[1:19:10] should be
[1:19:11] amen if you want god's program for this
[1:19:14] hour take that as the truth
[1:19:19] i know we are living at the day people
[1:19:20] have so many sympathies
[1:19:23] for all the churches for all the
[1:19:24] denominations
[1:19:26] i don't know what your headache is you
[1:19:28] didn't bring no man here
[1:19:30] and you are having some patches amen
[1:19:33] can you love a person more than his
[1:19:35] creator
[1:19:37] allow god to run his program there was a
[1:19:40] time it was matching luther
[1:19:42] all the portion that god was was giving
[1:19:44] them
[1:19:45] there was a time it was wesley the
[1:19:48] content that god was was giving them
[1:19:50] there was a time it was pentecost
[1:19:53] restored
[1:19:54] all that god wants was giving them but
[1:19:57] in these
[1:19:58] last days
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:01] god wants something beyond the best
[1:20:04] god wants the fullness and that is why
[1:20:07] the spirit of truth returned
[1:20:10] oh man the prophet when he
[1:20:14] sent a messenger he was first a
[1:20:18] messenger listen to me
[1:20:21] close earlier than you think he was
[1:20:24] first a
[1:20:24] messenger to laudacian church age
[1:20:28] don't forget that
[1:20:32] and that was revelations chapter two and
[1:20:36] chapter three
[1:20:37] unto the angel of laodicea right
[1:20:42] and that was why the book of the prophet
[1:20:46] ministry was spent in love this year
[1:20:50] 1946 to 1962
[1:20:55] the prophet was a messenger to laudacian
[1:20:58] church
[1:20:59] age hallelujah but even the prophet knew
[1:21:04] that the ministries in that era
[1:21:08] could not bring perfection
[1:21:14] are you catching it but
[1:21:18] the ministry in that era was what
[1:21:21] he called the years of preparation
[1:21:27] it wouldn't bring perfection but it is
[1:21:30] enough to prepare people
[1:21:32] amen and that was why the fullness of
[1:21:36] the wedge
[1:21:37] was not restored at that time
[1:21:42] the focus at that time was signs
[1:21:45] and wonders amen and let me tell you
[1:21:50] all the supernatural available was waved
[1:21:53] to this generation before this
[1:21:54] generation
[1:21:58] up to a man tommy husband who never came
[1:22:01] into tot pool
[1:22:05] spiritual men will understand what i'm
[1:22:07] saying tommy husband never came into the
[1:22:10] revelation of the wedge
[1:22:12] the full review mysteries of god but to
[1:22:15] the essence that he knew
[1:22:17] of the ministry to the benefit and the
[1:22:20] partaking
[1:22:22] of the signs and wonders the healing and
[1:22:25] the discernment
[1:22:26] look at what tommy says
[1:22:30] he said we we preach christ
[1:22:35] this man lived christ
[1:22:38] and he didn't see as much as you saw
[1:22:43] his eyes were not open to see the extent
[1:22:46] to which you have seen
[1:22:49] he said i can see jesus on two feet
[1:22:53] walking the streets of jeffersonville
[1:22:56] those were powerful statements
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:00] with the much that he knew
[1:23:03] if coming under the first and second
[1:23:07] pull could speak like that
[1:23:09] what you expect me to speak
[1:23:14] when the predestinated mystery of his
[1:23:16] will
[1:23:17] has been revealed
[1:23:23] i am saying the ministry
[1:23:28] that heals your body the ministry
[1:23:33] that touches your spirit couldn't bring
[1:23:36] you to perfection
[1:23:38] it couldn't bring you to adoption that
[1:23:41] is what i'm saying
[1:23:43] because the sign in the hands
[1:23:46] heal your body addresses your body
[1:23:48] condition
[1:23:50] messianic disarmament addresses your
[1:23:53] spirit condition
[1:23:55] it went into the inner recess of your
[1:23:57] spirit to bring out your secrets
[1:23:59] and tell you your solution but it is
[1:24:02] only the deadpool
[1:24:04] that addresses your soul
[1:24:08] and until your soul is reborn you cannot
[1:24:13] be talking of adoption there must be a
[1:24:16] breath amen the sun must be
[1:24:20] born first before the sun is too touched
[1:24:24] before the sun is strange before the sun
[1:24:27] is mature
[1:24:29] his maturity will be how much he has
[1:24:32] yielded to
[1:24:32] training hallelujah the fullness of the
[1:24:36] world
[1:24:37] was not given at that time so your
[1:24:40] training
[1:24:41] is a building block it cannot be perfect
[1:24:46] come on church
[1:24:51] but that is not to say that the ministry
[1:24:55] of the prophet
[1:24:56] ended like that or became truncated
[1:24:59] and that is not to say we will need
[1:25:01] another messenger
[1:25:03] to bring us to perfection
[1:25:06] that is another impersonation of the
[1:25:10] devil
[1:25:13] this is what it is william brown was
[1:25:16] only a vessel
[1:25:19] being used by christ it was christ
[1:25:22] under the first pull healing of the body
[1:25:26] it was christ under the second pool
[1:25:29] healing of our spirit and it will be
[1:25:31] christ
[1:25:32] again in the deadpool healing of our
[1:25:38] souls
[1:25:40] my son in whom i travail until
[1:25:43] christ be born in you amen
[1:25:46] christ wasn't born by the first or
[1:25:48] second bull
[1:25:50] it was the thoughtpool that produced
[1:25:52] christ
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:57] so for the third pool to come and bring
[1:26:00] us to the land where adoption is
[1:26:02] possible
[1:26:04] what did god do the ministry of
[1:26:07] laodicean messenger
[1:26:10] had to give way to the ministry of
[1:26:12] christ
[1:26:13] himself
[1:26:16] did you catch it did you catch it did
[1:26:19] you catch it
[1:26:21] this is why you will hear the prophet
[1:26:22] said i was not the one that appeared at
[1:26:25] ohio river i was only the person
[1:26:30] near when he appeared did you catch that
[1:26:33] but more beyond that let us come fast
[1:26:36] forward
[1:26:38] when the full word of god was to be born
[1:26:40] into manifestation
[1:26:47] in the message says is this the time
[1:26:51] six months before a powerful event that
[1:26:54] changed the course for the bride
[1:26:57] before the blood of christ turned a
[1:26:59] corner
[1:27:00] god sent a vision
[1:27:04] this we can only preach among believers
[1:27:08] god sent a vision and in that vision all
[1:27:11] the prophet saw was a blast
[1:27:17] and it looks so real to him that he
[1:27:20] thought
[1:27:20] that might be the end of his life
[1:27:24] he even went home to his wife to make
[1:27:27] preparation to set us out in order
[1:27:29] and to talk about how you know post will
[1:27:32] abraham
[1:27:32] how the family is going to be surviving
[1:27:39] that was how that vision was so real to
[1:27:41] him
[1:27:42] but what was real to him was not the
[1:27:45] interpretation
[1:27:47] that was why when the prophet was
[1:27:49] preaching the message says
[1:27:50] is this the time he put a lot of guesses
[1:27:54] amen could it be this could it be that
[1:27:58] could it be this could it be that amen
[1:28:01] and we cannot establish ourselves on
[1:28:04] guesses
[1:28:06] the blight can only be established on
[1:28:09] revelation
[1:28:12] beyond the guesses of the prophets
[1:28:15] hallelujah
[1:28:16] god has a revelation god has a blessing
[1:28:20] amen god was only announcing
[1:28:24] i hate what he was going to do on earth
[1:28:30] and true to this at god's
[1:28:33] right time seven injures actually swept
[1:28:37] down
[1:28:39] and it was a most terrible blast
[1:28:43] hallelujah and when they swept
[1:28:46] down what did they do they took the
[1:28:49] prophet
[1:28:50] in the midst of themselves and gave him
[1:28:53] a temporary rapture
[1:28:55] hallelujah why did they come down
[1:28:58] the prophet said they came with a
[1:29:00] message
[1:29:02] the meaning the revelation of that
[1:29:04] message they came with
[1:29:05] is only known in their midst so they had
[1:29:08] to take the prophet into the
[1:29:10] constellation of themselves
[1:29:12] to give him the revelation and when they
[1:29:15] brought him back
[1:29:16] god gave him a charge you were in the
[1:29:18] west go
[1:29:19] now east why did that event took place
[1:29:23] at tucson west
[1:29:25] to show that the sun was setting for the
[1:29:27] church of the world
[1:29:31] hallelujah why did god tell him to go
[1:29:34] back east
[1:29:34] jefferson to show that it will soon
[1:29:38] be the rising of the sun
[1:29:41] another day is going to be declared
[1:29:44] a new dispensation hallelujah
[1:29:48] friends god is not building a straight
[1:29:50] world god
[1:29:51] turned the corner
[1:29:56] and what did they tell him to go and do
[1:29:59] go and open
[1:30:01] the seals book amen it's become
[1:30:04] controversial to many
[1:30:06] but to those who have the spirit of god
[1:30:09] it's a
[1:30:09] certain sound hallelujah
[1:30:13] is to announce the grant for adoption
[1:30:16] go and open those hills amen because
[1:30:20] those
[1:30:20] revelations that are content in there
[1:30:23] amen they are necessary to abuse a man
[1:30:28] are you catching it to build a man to
[1:30:31] watch
[1:30:31] to a full stature to build a man to
[1:30:35] abduction material
[1:30:38] so it must be opened and he lost all the
[1:30:42] seals
[1:30:43] and when he finished losing the sales
[1:30:46] even the prophet said many things that
[1:30:48] god revealed
[1:30:50] in the seals and after the seals came
[1:30:54] better than his personal judgment
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:30:58] meaning that he himself never knew many
[1:31:01] things
[1:31:02] if he was to be our tutor under the holy
[1:31:05] ghost
[1:31:05] he must know his curriculum he must
[1:31:08] understand the syllabus
[1:31:10] the syllabus must be perfected in him
[1:31:13] the perfection of syllabus
[1:31:15] was what the angels came to give him
[1:31:18] hallelujah
[1:31:19] so that christ can become the captain of
[1:31:22] your salvation
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:27] are you catching it are you catching a
[1:31:30] church
[1:31:31] he said go back and lose the seals
[1:31:35] and here is the testimony of the
[1:31:37] prophets
[1:31:39] when those seals were loosed without us
[1:31:41] going into the content
[1:31:43] amen because one of the content of the
[1:31:46] seven seals is seven thunders itself
[1:31:49] hallelujah amen
[1:31:52] when you come to the seventh it unfolded
[1:31:55] into three things
[1:31:56] is that true will go with me all my life
[1:31:59] but i'm going to speak of
[1:32:00] one hallelujah and he began to speak of
[1:32:04] that one till he left praise the lord
[1:32:06] but suffice to say that the content
[1:32:09] of the seals
[1:32:13] we are necessary to build you an eye
[1:32:17] it wasn't just one thing it was the
[1:32:19] entire bible from genesis to revelation
[1:32:23] that is why the prophet after the seal
[1:32:25] said
[1:32:26] there are things we have said that we've
[1:32:28] got to pull back
[1:32:30] amen because under those seven church
[1:32:33] ages
[1:32:34] under the age of loud this year he spoke
[1:32:37] certain things
[1:32:38] by appealing to many studies but when
[1:32:41] the angel of the lord came down
[1:32:43] it became something else that was why
[1:32:46] the prophet himself said
[1:32:48] my bible became a new book
[1:32:54] amen because things that he knew be that
[1:32:57] he thought he knew before
[1:32:59] we are brought plainer hallelujah so
[1:33:02] it wasn't a condemnation but a
[1:33:04] progression of revelation
[1:33:07] a capstone of revelation a perfection of
[1:33:11] revelation
[1:33:12] so that this end time church can be
[1:33:14] perfectly touched
[1:33:16] and they have perfect understanding
[1:33:22] wherever you find out is the land of
[1:33:25] adoption
[1:33:27] why should our teaching be perfected
[1:33:32] when you go to the old testament
[1:33:35] when a child is born are you following
[1:33:38] me
[1:33:39] when a child is born and it begins to
[1:33:42] grow to a stage of being educated
[1:33:47] the father gets him a tutor
[1:33:53] this tutor has only one job
[1:33:57] to teach this man
[1:34:01] this child this son
[1:34:04] who has been born all the ways
[1:34:09] the leanings the styles
[1:34:12] the ideas the business understanding
[1:34:16] the methods the approach of the father
[1:34:22] let me tell you you can move your
[1:34:26] mountains
[1:34:27] amen you can scatter your heels
[1:34:32] but it's unconditioned
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:36] because god until god can trust you
[1:34:40] he cannot allow you the use of any power
[1:34:44] listen to me church
[1:34:47] the power that can close collapse this
[1:34:50] earth
[1:34:51] and create another one to live inside
[1:34:54] is in you
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:34:59] but what is the use of a power without
[1:35:02] character
[1:35:03] you will become a dictator
[1:35:06] you will misuse it can i have a witness
[1:35:09] of that
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:13] power with character is fit to rule
[1:35:17] power without character will work for
[1:35:19] satan
[1:35:21] this is why you must come into the land
[1:35:24] of adoption
[1:35:28] the land of adoption is where you have
[1:35:30] the perfect curriculum
[1:35:32] you don't just have the word you have
[1:35:34] the spirits
[1:35:37] you live under the shaking the glory of
[1:35:39] god
[1:35:41] that is the onliest of their holies
[1:35:48] you love him church
[1:35:53] so this tutor has got only one thing
[1:35:56] the father is too busy to train the
[1:35:59] child
[1:36:00] by himself but he got a trusted
[1:36:03] tutor with an
[1:36:06] up-to-date syllabus
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:12] not somebody who splices the tape
[1:36:16] not somebody who sees discrepancy
[1:36:19] contradiction in their tapes
[1:36:22] there is no contradiction whatsoever
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:27] it is your unwillingness to move with
[1:36:30] the tide of revelation
[1:36:32] it is your willingness to move with the
[1:36:34] leadership of the holy spirit
[1:36:36] that gives you contradiction what must
[1:36:40] be upon what
[1:36:42] that is what the grace any preacher
[1:36:44] could have
[1:36:45] is to be able to rightly divide the
[1:36:47] words
[1:36:49] he said this here and he said this year
[1:36:51] let me say something to the audience all
[1:36:53] over the world
[1:36:56] the prophet said there cannot be two
[1:36:59] truths
[1:37:00] on one item of doctrine
[1:37:04] that opposes each other listen to me
[1:37:07] again
[1:37:07] there cannot be two opposing truths
[1:37:11] on one subject of the wedge
[1:37:15] you come with the truth and it opposes
[1:37:17] what i have
[1:37:19] and we both say this is the truth this
[1:37:22] is also truth
[1:37:23] on one item of the word it is not true
[1:37:27] one is a lie or the two
[1:37:30] are lies or one is a lie
[1:37:34] and the other is the truth
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:37] if you care for blessing if you care for
[1:37:40] adoption
[1:37:41] it is your responsibility
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:45] to know which is the truth have not the
[1:37:49] faith of our lord jesus christ
[1:37:51] with respect of persons how many of you
[1:37:55] know the truth
[1:37:56] and because you don't want to be
[1:37:58] injurious to the feelings of one another
[1:38:01] you are shying away from the truth
[1:38:05] let me tell you compromising has never
[1:38:07] worked
[1:38:08] it has us always destroyed happy
[1:38:12] is that man who does not shun to declare
[1:38:15] the old cancer
[1:38:16] [Applause]
[1:38:19] i don't want to be popular with men all
[1:38:22] men do not have to love me
[1:38:24] but let me have favor with god
[1:38:31] that is christianity amen
[1:38:34] so if you are lingering between two
[1:38:36] opinions on any subject
[1:38:38] you better go search the wedge the
[1:38:41] message of the hour
[1:38:42] is a certain sound follow the
[1:38:45] progression of revelation
[1:38:47] and your life will line up because
[1:38:50] before you can be placed
[1:38:52] you need proper teaching
[1:38:58] in these days of error we need proper
[1:39:00] teaching
[1:39:01] amen you see why the devil is attacking
[1:39:05] the seven angels that came down the ring
[1:39:08] of mystery
[1:39:09] they will attack it because that is your
[1:39:12] open door for adoption
[1:39:15] they don't want you to be pleased i'm
[1:39:17] going to tell you something about
[1:39:18] sonship
[1:39:22] in a minute if they are denying this
[1:39:27] amen and they clustered around the
[1:39:29] message there is no truth in them
[1:39:33] amen if they are telling you other
[1:39:35] reasons why this came
[1:39:37] other than why it came for which is to
[1:39:39] bring the
[1:39:40] entire revelation upon the total wage
[1:39:43] there is also no truth in them
[1:39:45] i don't care how long you've held it you
[1:39:48] got to repent
[1:39:49] if you want to be placed
[1:39:54] this is not association amen
[1:39:58] this is identification
[1:40:04] the entire word of god has been opened
[1:40:07] and the curriculum is very rich
[1:40:10] spiritual food
[1:40:11] in due season so perfect
[1:40:14] because when the father
[1:40:17] needed his son to reflect
[1:40:21] him in order to be placed amen
[1:40:24] meaning in order to be abducted to be in
[1:40:27] charge
[1:40:28] of inheritances
[1:40:32] he got himself a tutor
[1:40:35] he must be an honest tutor who knows
[1:40:38] what he is doing
[1:40:40] he must understand his curriculums very
[1:40:43] well
[1:40:44] amen he knows what he exposes his
[1:40:47] students to
[1:40:50] and is only god one teaching
[1:40:53] every subject it takes amen
[1:40:57] is to bring in to the father's
[1:41:00] reflection
[1:41:01] church think about that
[1:41:05] so that one day the father will look at
[1:41:08] his son
[1:41:10] even if his face looks like the mother
[1:41:13] but when he listens to the son when he
[1:41:16] sees his manner
[1:41:17] his approach he will see himself
[1:41:21] hallelujah
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:26] i don't know how jesus physically look
[1:41:28] do you know
[1:41:30] this is the closest picture to hitch
[1:41:33] under
[1:41:33] inspiration that's what we are told amen
[1:41:36] but i want to know i know his life i
[1:41:40] know his manner
[1:41:41] i know his characteristics i know his
[1:41:44] ways
[1:41:45] that is what the tutor must teach me
[1:41:48] i must look like him in my appearance
[1:41:51] in my thinking in my attitude in my
[1:41:54] action
[1:41:55] in my reaction in my manner in all his
[1:41:59] ways
[1:42:00] hallelujah i must look like him
[1:42:04] even when people disagree with me in the
[1:42:06] way i react to it i must look like
[1:42:09] christ
[1:42:10] when he sees that it will see his
[1:42:12] reflection
[1:42:15] friends friends
[1:42:19] before a ghost meet could see his
[1:42:22] reflection in a gold
[1:42:24] that is walking upon there will be a lot
[1:42:26] of beating
[1:42:28] oh isn't that why the prophet in the
[1:42:32] message perfect
[1:42:33] faith he said it will mean a lot of
[1:42:36] shaking down for me it will mean a lot
[1:42:39] of shaking down for you
[1:42:40] we are going to drop many things right
[1:42:43] from our opinion
[1:42:45] to our thinking to our ideas to our
[1:42:48] habits
[1:42:49] to our lifestyles because we want to
[1:42:52] look like him
[1:42:54] he said but together by the grace of god
[1:42:57] we shall make it
[1:43:01] you know why because we are
[1:43:08] predestinated
[1:43:11] and may i say today the true church has
[1:43:14] made it
[1:43:17] this is why the true church must get the
[1:43:19] truth five fold
[1:43:21] it was a prophecy in 50s but by the
[1:43:24] grace of god it's happening now
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:27] this true five-fold is not brought by
[1:43:29] denomination
[1:43:31] this true path flow fivefold is not
[1:43:33] arched by denominations
[1:43:35] they are asked by the calling of god
[1:43:38] they were given the perfect word
[1:43:40] they know their position the prophet
[1:43:43] never explained the ministries for
[1:43:44] nothing
[1:43:45] he told us who the pastor would be he
[1:43:48] told us who the apostle will be
[1:43:50] who the teacher the evangelist the
[1:43:52] prophet he was blessing the offices
[1:43:54] and every true faithful will find
[1:43:56] themselves in that place
[1:43:58] and become a blessing
[1:44:02] because holy spirit under through you
[1:44:06] amen will bring the church to perfection
[1:44:10] it is not a sacrilege if you don't know
[1:44:12] what it takes to be adopted
[1:44:14] your ministry cannot produce adoption
[1:44:19] but if but in ephesians chapter four
[1:44:22] isn't the five-fold described there
[1:44:24] do you see how powerful their ministry
[1:44:26] will be and somebody denies the
[1:44:28] five-fold
[1:44:29] you won't come to perfection
[1:44:35] for the work of the ministry for this
[1:44:38] for that till we all come to what
[1:44:41] i think we should read that i think we
[1:44:44] should read it
[1:44:45] amen i'm not looking for a future of
[1:44:48] fivefold we have him now
[1:44:50] amen let's read what that fivefold will
[1:44:53] do
[1:44:54] oh glory to god
[1:45:05] let me just take it from verse 11 you
[1:45:07] when you get home you can read from
[1:45:08] verse 7.
[1:45:10] he said and he gave some apostles
[1:45:14] and some were prophets some evangelists
[1:45:18] and some pastors and teachers for what
[1:45:21] the perfecting of the saints
[1:45:27] the spirit of truth in these last days
[1:45:30] oh my
[1:45:31] what is the holy ghost giving for
[1:45:33] continuation of the work of christ
[1:45:36] amen god sent us an egg planter
[1:45:39] the first sheep in this age that ripen
[1:45:42] to show that more of such will come
[1:45:45] hallelujah the same holy ghost that gave
[1:45:48] us the messenger
[1:45:49] to develop the curriculum has given us
[1:45:52] the true five-fold
[1:45:53] who we teach the curriculum under the
[1:45:56] unction of the holy ghost to do what to
[1:45:59] bring perfection
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:03] perfecting the saints is it my word
[1:46:08] is it his word if it is the scripture
[1:46:11] you can't stop me from saying it
[1:46:15] the fivefold has a ministry to perfect
[1:46:18] you
[1:46:19] mind in this land of adoption for the
[1:46:22] perfecting of the saints
[1:46:24] for the work of the ministry and for the
[1:46:27] edifying of the body of christ
[1:46:30] amen they are to edify you
[1:46:34] they are to do the work of the ministry
[1:46:36] they are to bring you to perfection
[1:46:39] glory to god till we all come
[1:46:42] in the unity of the faith and of the
[1:46:45] knowledge of the son of god
[1:46:48] unto a perfect man unto the measure
[1:46:52] of the statue of the fullness of
[1:46:55] christ what a great
[1:46:59] responsibility upon the fivefold
[1:47:04] the truth of the holy spirit to teach
[1:47:08] the curriculum
[1:47:10] that has been fashioned by the opening
[1:47:12] of the wage
[1:47:14] by the angel who commissioned by the
[1:47:16] angel of revelation
[1:47:18] 10 who commissioned revelation 10 7
[1:47:21] angel
[1:47:22] he took him out of being the messenger
[1:47:25] to love this year
[1:47:27] and express himself
[1:47:30] through the messenger hallelujah to
[1:47:33] perfect his bride
[1:47:35] that was why when this ring of mystery
[1:47:38] was formed
[1:47:40] after the angels ascended what was the
[1:47:43] testimony of the prophet
[1:47:44] he said and it was our lord
[1:47:48] up there it was the lord jesus christ
[1:47:52] who came down to commission a servant to
[1:47:55] open the entire curriculum
[1:47:57] so that this end time tutors under the
[1:48:00] holy ghost
[1:48:01] will be able to teach the sons of god
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:07] to look like their father amen
[1:48:11] you could see why outside of christ you
[1:48:13] cannot be perfected
[1:48:16] even the world fight for the strengths
[1:48:18] of denominations
[1:48:21] the book of revelation is strange to
[1:48:23] denominations
[1:48:24] amen and unfortunately it takes the
[1:48:27] fightful to do the job
[1:48:28] so this five-fold is not bought by
[1:48:30] denominations
[1:48:32] they are not denominational ideas so
[1:48:34] we've moved beyond the range of 1955
[1:48:37] hallelujah we have come into the open
[1:48:40] world
[1:48:41] where each servant true fivefold knows
[1:48:43] their position
[1:48:44] they are calling and what they are sent
[1:48:46] to do for the bride
[1:48:48] and his working church his working
[1:48:51] church
[1:48:52] this church is going from glory to glory
[1:48:55] hallelujah we are seeing the blessings
[1:48:58] of god among
[1:48:58] us we are ripening each day because
[1:49:01] it is only the word that heals it is the
[1:49:05] word that sets free
[1:49:07] the word stretching without hands he
[1:49:09] unstopped deaf ear
[1:49:11] and is changing the sinner to saint i am
[1:49:15] seeing that and more will come
[1:49:18] because it is the perfection of the
[1:49:20] syllabus
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:27] if you aren't happy with that you need
[1:49:29] to come into the land of adoption
[1:49:33] by the way the use of the word land of
[1:49:35] adoption was in my statement it was the
[1:49:37] prophet who said true
[1:49:39] he said the land of adoption is in the
[1:49:41] holiest of the holies
[1:49:42] which we know it is the watch and the
[1:49:44] spirit the total watch and the spirit
[1:49:47] in these last days oh glory to god
[1:49:51] are you seeing the progression amen when
[1:49:56] this tutorial
[1:49:57] is going on listen i got to read
[1:50:00] something
[1:50:04] the prophet said what brings you to
[1:50:07] adoption
[1:50:09] what brings you to your placement amen
[1:50:13] when you start the adoption please
[1:50:16] understand this
[1:50:19] according to romans chapter 8 listen to
[1:50:22] me it might sound strange to you
[1:50:24] but this is the truth the fullness of
[1:50:27] your adoption
[1:50:28] is your body change
[1:50:32] that's the word is that to which
[1:50:35] the redemption of our body the what to
[1:50:39] wheat means to know
[1:50:42] so the earth is not just groaning to see
[1:50:46] you
[1:50:46] shut the heavens speak things into
[1:50:49] existence
[1:50:50] amen they want to see you fully restored
[1:50:54] because your body redemption takes them
[1:50:56] back
[1:50:57] to the beginning your body redemption
[1:51:00] brings the false quantity which brings
[1:51:03] perfection to the earth
[1:51:04] and they know that from that moment
[1:51:06] there will be nothing that will destroy
[1:51:08] or hurt again oh hallelujah
[1:51:13] this earth is tired of soaking
[1:51:16] drinking innocent blood the earth tells
[1:51:20] itself there will be a great day coming
[1:51:24] we are no wickedness do you know how
[1:51:27] many abortions have been done over the
[1:51:29] night
[1:51:30] the earth saw it amen inside it we have
[1:51:33] plenty of unwanted filters
[1:51:36] he saw it it doesn't want that
[1:51:39] he knew there will come a time that
[1:51:41] there will be no such things again
[1:51:43] that time will not come until you have a
[1:51:46] body change
[1:51:51] but while we wait for the fullness
[1:51:54] we've got to enjoy our blessing
[1:51:58] because there is blessing in adoption
[1:52:01] the blessing takes place before the body
[1:52:04] changes
[1:52:06] that is why even the prophet himself in
[1:52:09] revelations
[1:52:10] series he said the fullness comes
[1:52:14] at the resurrection the change of your
[1:52:16] body
[1:52:17] which is perfectly in line with the
[1:52:19] scriptures
[1:52:20] to which the redemption of our bodies
[1:52:26] but here church why are you being
[1:52:29] tutored
[1:52:31] and why must you listen to teaching
[1:52:35] so that you can be adoptable now let me
[1:52:37] make a striking statement
[1:52:39] and i'm going to say it with the prophet
[1:52:43] there are many who will become sons
[1:52:47] but will never be able to come to the
[1:52:49] place where they should be
[1:52:55] if you doubt let me read it for you
[1:52:57] because i want to strike one or two
[1:52:59] things as we're going to close now
[1:53:01] amen don't forget my own subject
[1:53:04] is the condition for each many people we
[1:53:07] have talked about
[1:53:09] manifestations how this will happen how
[1:53:12] that will happen
[1:53:13] how my brother may need rain and i got
[1:53:16] to speak it to him those things will
[1:53:17] happen
[1:53:19] and friends those things are happening
[1:53:23] it is not a sacrilege because i know
[1:53:25] they are
[1:53:26] and that is in line with also the
[1:53:28] scripture
[1:53:30] it was in adoption the prophet talked
[1:53:32] about the illness of our inheritance
[1:53:36] and he said the endness of your
[1:53:38] inheritance is the down payment of your
[1:53:40] inheritance
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:43] [Applause]
[1:53:44] meaning that whatever you are looking
[1:53:46] forward to you can be enjoying the teach
[1:53:49] beat
[1:53:49] now every once in a while and unfull and
[1:53:53] purpose
[1:53:53] will be given to this ruth
[1:53:56] in order to know our god is in our midst
[1:54:00] amen how many can testify
[1:54:03] that the life i used to live is no
[1:54:05] longer what i'm living now
[1:54:06] how many can testify that god has helped
[1:54:10] him to drop some habits
[1:54:12] how many have testified can testify that
[1:54:15] you have overcome
[1:54:17] certain prejudice certain behavior
[1:54:21] certain habits in your life if you have
[1:54:24] that testimony
[1:54:25] you are enjoying your enemies
[1:54:27] [Applause]
[1:54:31] and you know why you are having that
[1:54:33] testimony it's a witness
[1:54:35] that one of these days this body
[1:54:38] this physical dying body is going to
[1:54:41] give way
[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:44] for a glorification because it has
[1:54:47] already started
[1:54:52] if you don't have that testimony yet
[1:54:56] do something about it because nothing is
[1:54:59] wrong with the word
[1:55:01] but everything can be wrong with your
[1:55:03] life you cannot make him a liar
[1:55:06] hallelujah you should be able to tell
[1:55:09] who you where
[1:55:10] and who you are now amen you may not
[1:55:14] have arrived to where you should be
[1:55:16] but there is a work in progress there is
[1:55:19] a daily progression
[1:55:20] from glory to glory
[1:55:24] if it can heal your sickness it can save
[1:55:27] your soul
[1:55:28] it can change your life it can remove
[1:55:31] your captivity
[1:55:33] house of hell give way
[1:55:36] to the name of jesus christ
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:42] you must have that testimony it's
[1:55:44] important you do
[1:55:46] christianity is rest it is not up and
[1:55:49] down
[1:55:50] rising today i'm falling tomorrow that's
[1:55:53] not christianity
[1:55:54] christianity is a change christianity
[1:55:58] is an appetite and hunger for higher
[1:56:01] ground
[1:56:02] i'm pressing on the upward way new
[1:56:04] height i'm gaining every day
[1:56:06] still praying as i'm onward bound
[1:56:10] no downward bound not zigzagging i'm
[1:56:14] what bow
[1:56:15] lord plant my faith
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:18] [Applause]
[1:56:20] if yours is not like that then somebody
[1:56:22] told you be comfortable
[1:56:24] he's deceiving you he's a liar
[1:56:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:35] [Applause]
[1:56:37] don't mind me if i look crazy this
[1:56:39] morning i'm just enjoying the lord
[1:56:42] i'm just enjoying what i know to be the
[1:56:44] truth
[1:56:46] this is what i live for this is all i do
[1:56:49] this is what i post about
[1:56:54] hallelujah
[1:56:57] now i'm saying this serious condition
[1:57:01] as i wind down
[1:57:07] when you come into the land of adoption
[1:57:11] and you have a witness by the new birth
[1:57:14] that you are a son of god
[1:57:17] because there's a language in the bible
[1:57:20] now are we
[1:57:22] the sons of god do you know what the
[1:57:23] bible says and it will look as if
[1:57:26] that there is no predestination involved
[1:57:29] but what the scripture is telling you
[1:57:31] is that the realization done on you
[1:57:35] are you catching it they don't joining
[1:57:37] of realization
[1:57:38] now i know
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:42] who i am lord i can see now
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:48] but you can be a son and yet
[1:57:52] you never get placed in your inheritance
[1:58:00] my brothers my sisters
[1:58:03] what places you is your conduct
[1:58:07] your response to the tutoring
[1:58:14] this is why to every believer
[1:58:17] profanity must not be in our vocabulary
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:24] profanity is taking spiritual matters
[1:58:28] lightly if god taught us
[1:58:31] conduct if god taught us order
[1:58:35] if god taught us doctrine that is the
[1:58:38] entire syllabus of the message
[1:58:40] we must follow it
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:44] if you truly have the holy spirit you
[1:58:47] will look for it
[1:58:49] many of you are inventing your ideas for
[1:58:52] worship
[1:58:53] where did you get it from
[1:58:56] god sent a messenger to show us how to
[1:59:00] worship
[1:59:01] hallelujah do you know the people
[1:59:04] who inhabited who took over the land of
[1:59:06] israel
[1:59:07] were destroyed at a time simply because
[1:59:11] they overrun god's church order it's in
[1:59:14] your bible until they had to go and
[1:59:17] fetch a prophet
[1:59:18] of israel from captivity back to the
[1:59:21] land of israel
[1:59:22] to do what to teach the people the way
[1:59:26] of god's worship so the lions and
[1:59:29] devourers
[1:59:30] and the hyenas will not destroy them
[1:59:33] again
[1:59:34] spiritual hyenas and lions are divorcing
[1:59:38] souls of men today
[1:59:40] because you don't know your church
[1:59:42] orders
[1:59:44] you want to sing you want to do things
[1:59:46] like the pentecostal you want to do
[1:59:48] things like
[1:59:48] it wouldn't work in the message
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:51] [Music]
[1:59:53] don't follow the message affectedly let
[1:59:56] pastors like churches let's go and look
[1:59:59] at the order again
[2:00:01] the prophet never gave those sins for
[2:00:04] nothing
[2:00:05] is to show us the secret of god
[2:00:10] there must be a right response
[2:00:13] i like it conduct all the adoption isn't
[2:00:16] that what the entire world is all about
[2:00:19] that's the old syllabus church we must
[2:00:22] follow it
[2:00:24] you want to get married you must follow
[2:00:26] it
[2:00:27] don't invent your local ideas amen
[2:00:31] the word of god is universal it's right
[2:00:34] over every customs and traditions
[2:00:39] come back to the world but i've always
[2:00:42] found out this
[2:00:43] if a man does not have the spirit to
[2:00:45] quicken the word to him
[2:00:47] he cannot cope with the word
[2:00:52] but i can cope with the ideas amen
[2:00:55] they can cope with what some men touch
[2:00:57] them
[2:01:01] let's come back to the word friends amen
[2:01:06] this is what the prophet said make no
[2:01:08] mistake about this
[2:01:09] a man that is filled with the holy ghost
[2:01:12] will be in the word
[2:01:13] all the way oh
[2:01:17] [Applause]
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:21] because listen to what the prophet said
[2:01:24] i must read this one and i hope i get it
[2:01:29] there are so many but we can read all
[2:01:31] but let's read one or two
[2:01:33] amen amen
[2:01:37] you love the lord this amen
[2:01:47] let's get this
[2:01:57] now in the message the position in
[2:01:59] christ
[2:02:00] you may not bother yourself preach in
[2:02:03] 1960
[2:02:04] may 22nd in the morning now
[2:02:08] paragraph 73 i have here
[2:02:11] now placing the sun fasting
[2:02:14] after the sun was in he become
[2:02:18] a son but we find out
[2:02:21] his behavior is what sets
[2:02:24] him to adoption
[2:02:27] whether he behaved right or not
[2:02:31] hallelujah now
[2:02:34] i'm going to rob this really hard listen
[2:02:37] to the prophet
[2:02:39] because i don't mean it to be rude
[2:02:42] please don't really
[2:02:43] don't really think i'm i'm mean i don't
[2:02:46] want to be
[2:02:47] what worries me is to take people
[2:02:51] and preach to them this god sends truth
[2:02:56] listen to this and then we turn right
[2:02:58] back around
[2:02:59] and just keep on doing the same thing
[2:03:03] that just nearly ruins you
[2:03:07] sorry they will come back around and
[2:03:09] just keep doing the same thing
[2:03:11] and say they got the holy ghost
[2:03:15] the prophet said that just nearly ruins
[2:03:18] a man
[2:03:25] your attitude to this god sent truth
[2:03:31] is what determines your pleasing in
[2:03:34] adoption
[2:03:37] and in another message the prophet said
[2:03:39] the attitude i'm talking about
[2:03:42] is your obedience
[2:03:46] how much obedience are you to the reveal
[2:03:48] what for the hour
[2:03:53] how approximately
[2:03:56] how close are you keeping the wedge
[2:04:01] have you looked into the conduct have
[2:04:03] you looked into the other
[2:04:04] have you looked into the doctrine or you
[2:04:07] are coming with your devices oh i could
[2:04:10] preach we could
[2:04:11] just get along and do all kinds of
[2:04:13] things no sir
[2:04:15] the prophet said for everything you do
[2:04:18] even if it could be a tool to bring
[2:04:21] many souls to god there is still the
[2:04:25] will of god to be sought
[2:04:27] don't just be running up and down get
[2:04:30] the will of god
[2:04:31] and do your running inside the truth
[2:04:35] god is not going to accept you because
[2:04:37] you can sweat for him
[2:04:39] no no no no no he's not going to accept
[2:04:42] you because you can do so much for him
[2:04:44] whatever you are doing must come back to
[2:04:46] the world
[2:04:47] [Applause]
[2:04:50] if it is not you are wasting your time
[2:04:53] it is your obedience to what he says
[2:04:58] your conduct around what he says
[2:05:02] because the tutor is not going to teach
[2:05:04] you anything
[2:05:06] but the wishes of your father
[2:05:09] the business method of your father the
[2:05:12] approach of your father
[2:05:14] how your father conduct himself how he
[2:05:17] behaved
[2:05:18] so that when your father looked at you
[2:05:20] by orientation
[2:05:22] you are looking exactly like him
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:28] this is the aspect where many feel and
[2:05:31] think it's just sufficient to serve the
[2:05:33] lord
[2:05:34] but listen to this i'm going to read one
[2:05:38] another one
[2:05:41] listen to this carefully
[2:05:54] in the message here in him 1956
[2:05:57] september 38th paragraph 26 the prophet
[2:06:02] said
[2:06:03] and then the father after he had given
[2:06:06] the totals
[2:06:07] the right to raise his son
[2:06:11] the tutor had to bring word to the
[2:06:14] father
[2:06:15] how the son was progressing
[2:06:18] now yet he was air of all things
[2:06:23] but yet he didn't come into legal
[2:06:26] possession
[2:06:28] until there was a ceremony
[2:06:31] and he had fully done that which was
[2:06:34] right
[2:06:35] and was worthy
[2:06:38] now listen to this now many people
[2:06:42] is in the health today and i
[2:06:45] say this with all respect
[2:06:48] there is perhaps many perhaps many
[2:06:51] certain right here
[2:06:53] who is absolutely living under your
[2:06:56] privilege as
[2:06:58] sons and daughters of god
[2:07:01] i won't say you will be lost listen
[2:07:05] no because when god saves you and loses
[2:07:09] you
[2:07:09] then oh my i'm not trying to preach
[2:07:11] doctrine
[2:07:12] i'm only saying if god now if you are
[2:07:15] not just mentally worked up
[2:07:17] but if god saves you knowing he is going
[2:07:20] to lose you
[2:07:21] it defeats his purpose it doesn't do
[2:07:25] that when he saves you you are saved
[2:07:29] either hearing my words and believe it
[2:07:32] on him that sent
[2:07:33] me at everlasting life and shall never
[2:07:37] come
[2:07:37] into judgment but is passed from
[2:07:40] death onto life so you are still
[2:07:44] a son and daughter but you are
[2:07:47] living under your privilege and your
[2:07:50] conduct each day
[2:07:53] as the holy spirit brings it before the
[2:07:56] father
[2:07:57] gives away the things that you do
[2:08:00] and you are still a son and daughter
[2:08:04] but you will never be brought to the
[2:08:06] place
[2:08:07] where you should be
[2:08:12] did you hear me
[2:08:15] great gifts that are in the church are
[2:08:18] so misused
[2:08:20] no reverence to it and just a bunch of
[2:08:23] carrying on
[2:08:24] until it even brings disgrace in the
[2:08:26] public
[2:08:27] out that the holy spirit would like to
[2:08:29] govern that
[2:08:30] bring it down bring it down
[2:08:34] isn't that something powerful we should
[2:08:35] think about
[2:08:38] you won't be lost but you will never be
[2:08:41] brought to the place where you should be
[2:08:44] meaning you will never be placed
[2:08:52] but you will be resurrected or you will
[2:08:54] have a body change
[2:08:57] you enjoy the fullness of adoption but
[2:09:00] you were not placed
[2:09:01] into your inheritance
[2:09:06] say can you back these statements up
[2:09:09] that the prophet said it is enough for
[2:09:11] me
[2:09:14] but if you challenge that i will back it
[2:09:16] up with the scriptures
[2:09:19] as i wind down by the grace of god
[2:09:24] do you remember polycarp let me start
[2:09:26] with the message
[2:09:27] did you remember polycarp
[2:09:32] polycarp by the revealed world
[2:09:36] would have been the messenger to the
[2:09:38] second church age
[2:09:41] that's what the word said and i believe
[2:09:44] let me tell you
[2:09:45] the prophet has a scripture for
[2:09:46] everything they touch
[2:09:49] it is the poverty of our understanding
[2:09:51] that makes it strange to us
[2:09:53] are we coming through the scriptures for
[2:09:54] you in a minute
[2:09:57] but let me start from here and i've
[2:09:59] shared some of this before
[2:10:02] polycarp would have been the messenger
[2:10:04] of that age
[2:10:06] it was fun worthy it was fine qualified
[2:10:11] but he messed up in a conduct
[2:10:16] he has too much sympathy for
[2:10:18] organization
[2:10:20] and because of that he was disqualified
[2:10:24] he lived under his privilege as a son of
[2:10:28] god it was never brought to the place
[2:10:31] where it should be
[2:10:33] [Applause]
[2:10:34] he missed his blessing it means his
[2:10:38] adoption
[2:10:39] but in glory you will see him
[2:10:43] it was a saint of all ages
[2:10:47] this is a mystery of adoption now
[2:10:50] revealed
[2:10:51] i'm not preaching mystery be careful of
[2:10:54] those who say they are preaching mystery
[2:10:57] mysteries have already been preached and
[2:10:59] revealed
[2:11:01] what we are doing is recalling
[2:11:03] revelation
[2:11:05] hallelujah it is the job of the fivefold
[2:11:09] we are not we are not tell we are not
[2:11:12] tailors
[2:11:14] to cut and sow the dress of the bride
[2:11:18] sister brother
[2:11:19] has already been sown
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:23] and a spell of fit because the lord
[2:11:26] knows your sizes
[2:11:28] hallelujah what i need to do
[2:11:31] is to furnish you with the garment to go
[2:11:34] into the wardrobe
[2:11:35] and give it to you and dress you up
[2:11:39] [Applause]
[2:11:41] i am not a cook i'm a waiter
[2:11:46] a server because the food has already
[2:11:49] been cooked
[2:11:51] it is a full course menu sister will
[2:11:54] have callings
[2:11:54] under the seven visions that were spoken
[2:11:58] of
[2:11:58] or seven dreams that became interpreted
[2:12:00] in the message size is this the time
[2:12:02] he saw the spiritual foot the entire
[2:12:04] revelation of the world
[2:12:06] as a food being served by the right
[2:12:08] person
[2:12:10] it was saved by the prophet because that
[2:12:13] kind of meal
[2:12:14] can only be made available by the
[2:12:16] messenger
[2:12:18] it was well cooked with enough salt
[2:12:21] with enough curry time and seasoning
[2:12:24] amen
[2:12:24] my job is not to cook it again
[2:12:29] it was cooked and frozen it was
[2:12:32] touched so what i need to do is to bring
[2:12:36] it out of the storehouse
[2:12:38] and warm it on the microwave of my knees
[2:12:42] and serve it to you you must never feed
[2:12:46] on me
[2:12:48] you must never feed on any fivefold you
[2:12:50] mustn't even
[2:12:51] feed on the prophet messenger not to
[2:12:54] talk of little little wheelies like us
[2:12:58] you must feed on the lord jesus christ
[2:13:03] unfailing by the word so no cook here
[2:13:08] and no taylor here dress where
[2:13:11] and wait us to serve enjoy the serving
[2:13:16] polycarp was supposed to be the
[2:13:21] that would have been his blessing into
[2:13:24] his inheritance
[2:13:26] but he missed it because of his
[2:13:30] conduct his level of obedience
[2:13:33] and yet the man who became the messenger
[2:13:36] irenaeus
[2:13:37] was a student under police
[2:13:40] he lent at his faith think about that
[2:13:46] do you believe the reviewers come on
[2:13:49] friends
[2:13:53] let me come to saul and david
[2:13:58] do you know even let me start from eli
[2:14:00] the priest of god
[2:14:02] do you know the plan of god was to
[2:14:04] establish enlightened priesthood forever
[2:14:09] that his priesthood will be from his
[2:14:10] generation to generation
[2:14:12] is that scriptural that's in the
[2:14:15] scripture
[2:14:16] why did he miss it he
[2:14:19] missed it because of compromise
[2:14:25] it can rise up to discipline it can't
[2:14:28] right it does not have the will to
[2:14:30] appropriate the world
[2:14:33] it's all your con that's why i said you
[2:14:36] gotta got the right tutor
[2:14:38] and whatever you have been taught your
[2:14:40] action will be weighed by it
[2:14:42] because god must trust you before it
[2:14:45] places you
[2:14:46] you can have a fantastic great ministry
[2:14:50] and yet you have some
[2:14:53] some little little rubbish around you it
[2:14:56] will
[2:14:56] change your life
[2:14:58] [Applause]
[2:15:04] what did god also
[2:15:08] it was on the day that god will have
[2:15:11] permanently established the kingdom of
[2:15:14] saul
[2:15:16] what david had saul was meant to have it
[2:15:19] by the scripture
[2:15:20] read your bible succession of kingship
[2:15:23] throughout his own generation over
[2:15:25] israel it's in the bible
[2:15:28] so the prophet never taught outside the
[2:15:30] scripture
[2:15:32] that would have been his inheritance
[2:15:34] your blessing
[2:15:35] is your inheritance and the ability to
[2:15:38] enjoy and spend it
[2:15:42] but god is not going to give it to a man
[2:15:45] i'm going to wind up in march 11.
[2:15:50] already winding down but god is not
[2:15:52] going to give it to amateur
[2:15:58] what david eventually enjoyed as a
[2:16:00] covenant
[2:16:02] that it will never he must always have a
[2:16:05] son
[2:16:06] to sit on the throne of israel
[2:16:10] do you know it was a covenant it was a
[2:16:13] con
[2:16:13] it was a covenant of saul the great
[2:16:16] grandchildren of david
[2:16:17] reminded jeroboam do you remember that
[2:16:20] when jeroboam amassed 900 000 army
[2:16:24] to come and fight 400. leopold and told
[2:16:28] him he said don't waste your time
[2:16:31] if you were bequeathed it was the
[2:16:33] failure of my father
[2:16:35] that gave you part of the kingdom of
[2:16:38] israel
[2:16:39] you might have gotten many but god is
[2:16:41] not many you as is with us
[2:16:46] for once that guy knew who he was
[2:16:49] i like that
[2:16:53] he said do you know that god gave
[2:16:56] covenant to
[2:16:57] my father david a bypass or woman
[2:17:00] it was a grandchild he said and the
[2:17:02] covenant he made to david
[2:17:04] was a covenant of salt salt is a
[2:17:08] preserver
[2:17:09] it means an enduring covenant that can
[2:17:13] never decay
[2:17:14] that can never expire it will always be
[2:17:17] enforced
[2:17:19] my how many seats of abraham are here
[2:17:23] our covenant so convenient of salt
[2:17:28] thy sage shall possess
[2:17:31] [Applause]
[2:17:34] let me say it don't be my enemy
[2:17:38] don't be my enemy because i will possess
[2:17:41] your
[2:17:42] gates
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:47] you are wasting your time the moment you
[2:17:49] become my enemy you lost the bathroom
[2:17:53] that means your gate is ready for me to
[2:17:55] take over
[2:17:57] and believe me i will take it over
[2:17:59] because it is in prophecy
[2:18:01] that i must take it over i am here
[2:18:05] to be an actualization of the wage
[2:18:08] i am here to give a proof that jesus
[2:18:12] is the same yesterday today
[2:18:15] and forever don't be my enemy
[2:18:19] because i will possess your gates
[2:18:25] those who bless you shall surely be
[2:18:27] blessed
[2:18:28] [Applause]
[2:18:29] those who curse you let us hang it for
[2:18:31] them maybe they will repent some days
[2:18:36] hallelujah
[2:18:40] what became the inheritance i'm saying
[2:18:44] it of of david was meant for saul
[2:18:47] i say it by the scriptures
[2:18:51] the philistines were ready to battle
[2:18:55] they were battling and they surrendered
[2:18:58] entire israel and saul had somewhere
[2:19:03] somewhere told him don't disturb
[2:19:05] yourself go to social mountain
[2:19:07] prepare me the altar prepare the
[2:19:09] sacrifice i'm coming
[2:19:12] that is the wedge
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:15] can we just trust the world
[2:19:18] the problem why you are always anxious
[2:19:20] is that you keep looking around
[2:19:24] you keep trusting your feelings he said
[2:19:26] i will not fear what men will do unto me
[2:19:29] because my confidence is a covenant of
[2:19:31] salt
[2:19:33] when the enemy invoke it god will
[2:19:35] respond
[2:19:38] hallelujah
[2:19:42] wait there i am coming that was what
[2:19:44] someone told us all
[2:19:46] but this soul is not used to obedience
[2:19:54] god sent him to go and wipe out a
[2:19:55] malachite
[2:19:57] because of the fear of people having the
[2:20:00] faith of our lord jesus christ with
[2:20:01] respect to a person
[2:20:02] he spears something and you see this
[2:20:06] man who does not know obedience to the
[2:20:08] word also has one habit
[2:20:10] he can't repent some of you are like
[2:20:14] that
[2:20:15] to say sorry is a problem you will only
[2:20:19] explain the reason why the story
[2:20:20] shouldn't be necessary
[2:20:23] that is the life of soul is conduct its
[2:20:26] obedience
[2:20:27] is what was what church changed him
[2:20:35] and you know as he was looking
[2:20:38] the philistines were charging charging i
[2:20:41] don't know if he listens in your life
[2:20:43] they can only charge they cannot advance
[2:20:48] if god said wait you better wait don't
[2:20:51] do
[2:20:51] anything to help yourself because that
[2:20:54] may be the day
[2:20:55] god really wanted to establish wants to
[2:20:57] establish your kingdom
[2:20:59] by vindicating you before those
[2:21:01] philistines
[2:21:02] that was the plan ah the bible says saul
[2:21:07] he saw the philistines they kept coming
[2:21:10] close
[2:21:10] moving an inch every day then the people
[2:21:12] that we all around him
[2:21:14] started scattering and he knew that when
[2:21:17] the people become scattered he becomes
[2:21:19] naked himself
[2:21:20] that means he has lost jurisdiction he
[2:21:23] has lost control
[2:21:24] he's no longer in charge that would look
[2:21:27] like a pitiable condition
[2:21:30] that could make a man act under pressure
[2:21:33] we all find ourselves in those
[2:21:34] situations sometimes
[2:21:36] but don't forget the instructions wait
[2:21:39] did i wait upon the lord
[2:21:42] those that wait upon the lord
[2:21:45] shall renew their strength they shall
[2:21:48] mount up with wings a son
[2:21:50] they shall run and not be weary they
[2:21:53] shall walk and not faint
[2:21:55] teach me lord to wait let me trust your
[2:21:59] words
[2:22:00] above my environment when all around my
[2:22:03] soul gives way
[2:22:05] be my hope be my stay wait
[2:22:10] stand still and see the salvation of the
[2:22:13] lord
[2:22:14] don't act under pressure it could cause
[2:22:17] you
[2:22:18] beyond the immediate losses you see
[2:22:23] don't try to help yourself
[2:22:27] contrary to god's divine provision it
[2:22:30] can never abandon you
[2:22:34] wait
[2:22:36] saul never waited when he saw those
[2:22:39] things
[2:22:40] humanly speaking he had a reason to act
[2:22:45] but his action was beyond him you know
[2:22:47] what he did it took it upon himself to
[2:22:50] offer the sacrifice
[2:22:51] what somewhere wanted to do was an
[2:22:53] intercession to bring the presence of
[2:22:56] god down
[2:22:56] so they could defeat the enemy come on
[2:22:59] friends
[2:23:01] but it must be somewhere
[2:23:05] not soul saul couldn't wait
[2:23:09] he buckled under anxiety
[2:23:13] he buckled under pressure and he offered
[2:23:16] the sacrifice
[2:23:17] and it so happened that faith was unkind
[2:23:21] to him
[2:23:22] as he finished the offering someone came
[2:23:27] please why didn't somewhere come before
[2:23:29] that time
[2:23:31] what was somewhere waiting for church
[2:23:34] god must prove you
[2:23:35] [Applause]
[2:23:37] hallelujah god must prove
[2:23:41] you it doesn't entrust his gift into the
[2:23:45] hands of our materials
[2:23:49] you must be sent solid proven
[2:23:53] little light afflictions the utterances
[2:23:55] that come from the mouth of some of you
[2:23:59] even god will close his eyes in shame
[2:24:03] is this all i've produced for a child
[2:24:06] think on your ways
[2:24:10] i believe christian can still sing in
[2:24:12] tribulations
[2:24:14] to the believer it is always well
[2:24:18] never negative always positive
[2:24:23] think on your ways
[2:24:27] and somebody came and said so what did
[2:24:29] you do what are you doing
[2:24:31] if the people in philistines were coming
[2:24:33] upon me
[2:24:34] the people were leaving me and if i
[2:24:36] don't do something
[2:24:37] to create a running point the whole
[2:24:39] nation will be scattered
[2:24:41] this is what i did someone said
[2:24:45] what is this that you have done
[2:24:49] that thing paints somewhere so much
[2:24:51] until it was mourning for saul
[2:24:54] because for a man to be at the verge of
[2:24:57] a blessing
[2:24:58] a blessing into a permanent inheritance
[2:25:01] and to fritter it
[2:25:02] away somewhere mourn so much for saul
[2:25:06] until god had to come and
[2:25:07] ask my friend how long will you mom for
[2:25:10] saul get up now
[2:25:11] and go and do my work
[2:25:15] do you see the god you and i have is
[2:25:18] only the only way
[2:25:20] you can get god emotional is when you do
[2:25:22] what the world says
[2:25:25] are you listening to me
[2:25:29] someone said and it is just today
[2:25:33] now will god have established your
[2:25:36] kingdom permanently
[2:25:42] and you threw it permanently away
[2:25:48] saul saul he missed his blessing
[2:25:52] he misses inheritance it means an
[2:25:55] adoption
[2:25:58] you will see him in glory he will not be
[2:26:00] lost
[2:26:01] amen even when the witch of endor called
[2:26:04] him what someone saw
[2:26:05] said show that song wasn't lost he said
[2:26:08] you will be with me where i
[2:26:09] am somewhere wasn't in here
[2:26:14] but saul never came to what it should
[2:26:16] have been
[2:26:19] david took it learn a lesson we are
[2:26:22] looking at individual lives now
[2:26:24] learn a lesson from that some of us our
[2:26:28] ministries
[2:26:28] our life even our achievements became
[2:26:32] dwarfed
[2:26:34] we never come to what we should be
[2:26:37] it might be because of pride it might be
[2:26:40] arrogance
[2:26:41] it might be disobedience it might be
[2:26:43] prejudice
[2:26:44] it might be filthy lives
[2:26:48] a lot of us are never free from immoral
[2:26:50] living
[2:26:51] i think that is more powerful than the
[2:26:53] holy ghost
[2:26:56] might be lies see i repent
[2:27:00] yes you repent but sometimes it comes at
[2:27:02] the cost
[2:27:05] the cost won't take you out eternally
[2:27:08] apostle paul said it i will wind it up
[2:27:10] on him
[2:27:11] apostle paul said the bride will not be
[2:27:15] judged in glory
[2:27:16] amen but you know there is a future
[2:27:19] element of our own judgment
[2:27:22] the judgment of our works
[2:27:26] is in the scripture your works will be
[2:27:29] tried
[2:27:30] apostle paul said mind what you are
[2:27:32] doing
[2:27:34] he said the works of some can only be
[2:27:36] described as woods
[2:27:38] haze and stubbles white some are brass
[2:27:41] blondes
[2:27:42] some are silver and some are gold
[2:27:46] and they said the same chemical the same
[2:27:49] thing with try all
[2:27:50] fire for us to sit down which we stand
[2:27:54] and that which will not stand it's a
[2:27:57] judgment for
[2:27:58] rewards your soul is already saved
[2:28:01] you will make it you will live in
[2:28:03] eternity but a lot with misery watch
[2:28:06] because they miss their blessing
[2:28:11] there's going to be a reward time it
[2:28:13] could be around
[2:28:14] the wedding the marriage top of the lamb
[2:28:16] of three and a half years
[2:28:17] but the prophet testified that there was
[2:28:20] a great gathering of the saints
[2:28:21] up in glory how many ever read it
[2:28:24] equality dream a vision or something
[2:28:27] he said there was a great gathering and
[2:28:29] each person
[2:28:30] that has a price was being called and
[2:28:32] while he's been called to come and
[2:28:34] receive his prize
[2:28:34] the rest will be clapping and cheering
[2:28:36] him my
[2:28:38] it's going to be a great time in glory
[2:28:41] and he said when he was called william
[2:28:43] when he was called i don't know how it
[2:28:44] was maybe william brown or something
[2:28:46] he said he came out and as he was
[2:28:48] stepping toward
[2:28:49] his take his reward all of a sudden he
[2:28:52] felt something on the right
[2:28:54] when he looked it was over he felt
[2:28:56] something on the left
[2:28:57] when he looked it was middle the prophet
[2:29:00] started weeping
[2:29:01] he said it's a great blessing that the
[2:29:03] two women
[2:29:04] who associated with me in life are also
[2:29:07] with me next eternity
[2:29:09] to receive our rewards there is going to
[2:29:11] be a price-giving day church
[2:29:15] there is going to be a judgment of our
[2:29:17] work
[2:29:17] [Applause]
[2:29:19] let's do something for the lord let us
[2:29:22] excel
[2:29:23] he said doubt acceptable doubt excellent
[2:29:25] more than the daughters
[2:29:27] amen beyond your reasonable service do
[2:29:32] something for the lord
[2:29:33] conduct yourself right come into the
[2:29:36] wedge
[2:29:37] search what the word says search what it
[2:29:40] says for our song service
[2:29:41] for our worship service for every aspect
[2:29:44] of our service
[2:29:45] for our thinking should be how trusted
[2:29:48] should be
[2:29:49] how everything must be placed and in
[2:29:51] order search what the word of god says
[2:29:54] and take that position because this
[2:29:57] end time bride must approximate the wage
[2:30:02] completely
[2:30:06] think about that see
[2:30:09] it's it's it's it's so deep it's so it's
[2:30:12] so touchy i cannot leave it
[2:30:15] but david who was given that blessing
[2:30:19] to eventually become the one who was
[2:30:21] placed into that permanent inheritance
[2:30:25] so much that when you come
[2:30:28] into the millennium you will still be
[2:30:30] governed by the throne of david
[2:30:33] as long as there is time you will be
[2:30:35] under the throne of david
[2:30:37] how did david got it he went through the
[2:30:40] same challenge he saw heart
[2:30:42] but it was his conduct this is where the
[2:30:44] prophet said
[2:30:45] your conduct your obedience determines
[2:30:48] your blessing
[2:30:53] these words should not be in vain church
[2:30:56] let's let's study them let's pray our
[2:30:59] life into them
[2:31:00] let's search it daily thy whatever
[2:31:02] search before me always
[2:31:04] don't gloss over it and do contrary and
[2:31:07] with the spirit of god
[2:31:08] and the quickly realization of sonship
[2:31:11] you can never be tired of the world
[2:31:13] [Applause]
[2:31:16] i can give many experiences of david but
[2:31:18] let me give one
[2:31:21] and god typified it in that life
[2:31:25] david was anointed
[2:31:28] after saul after god took somewhere away
[2:31:31] from the mourning of saul isn't it
[2:31:34] he went to the house of jesus and
[2:31:36] anointed david
[2:31:38] it looked like god was in a hurry
[2:31:41] because this man that was anointed
[2:31:43] never came to the throne until eight
[2:31:45] years after
[2:31:49] he never took the throne of judah until
[2:31:51] about 80 years
[2:31:53] and he never took the entire throne of
[2:31:54] israel until
[2:31:56] seven more years making about 15 years
[2:31:59] the question is why was god in the hurry
[2:32:02] to anoint him
[2:32:05] enes of your inheritance there must be a
[2:32:09] witness to
[2:32:10] you who you are there was a witness to
[2:32:14] david i'm a king
[2:32:17] there must be a witness to you that you
[2:32:19] are the son of god
[2:32:20] and if you are a son you will rule and
[2:32:23] reign
[2:32:24] and he said right now as a foretest
[2:32:28] we are ruling we have dominion over sin
[2:32:31] over satan over flesh
[2:32:35] over disease over this world
[2:32:38] right now but we are still going to rule
[2:32:40] and reign more
[2:32:41] [Applause]
[2:32:44] we shall reign with him
[2:32:48] he must have the witness of who he is
[2:32:51] and god gave him witness now
[2:32:54] before between his witness and his
[2:32:58] blessing see what happened
[2:33:02] david went through the most of all
[2:33:05] trials
[2:33:06] god must prove you when the proven block
[2:33:11] your temptations are trials they've got
[2:33:13] nothing to do to you
[2:33:15] there is no enough problem on earth that
[2:33:17] can send you to hell
[2:33:18] take it from me you are a seed of god
[2:33:21] your eternity is certain and secured
[2:33:24] [Applause]
[2:33:27] no temptation no evil can send you to
[2:33:30] hell
[2:33:31] but god must allow them to prove you
[2:33:34] to mature you god does not it is the
[2:33:38] devil
[2:33:41] that tempts you temptation is to make
[2:33:43] you doubt who you are
[2:33:45] your sonship but the testing testing
[2:33:49] is to give you a proof that you are the
[2:33:51] son of god
[2:33:52] when you test you test with a positive
[2:33:55] mind
[2:33:56] let us be sure it is working isn't it
[2:33:59] but when you attempt you tempt with a
[2:34:01] negative mind
[2:34:02] to to flood the person into evil
[2:34:05] so god doesn't attempt a test because
[2:34:09] it's god to prove you
[2:34:11] it's going to prove your character he's
[2:34:14] got to try to train you
[2:34:16] all the curriculum that you have been
[2:34:18] taught there must be a practical aspect
[2:34:21] so that you become the total man and
[2:34:24] that was why
[2:34:25] god placed the man who killed david
[2:34:28] into his hand twice saul's intention was
[2:34:31] clear
[2:34:32] is to kill david he said so
[2:34:35] jonathan said so david knows so
[2:34:38] the back we read it all in the bible
[2:34:42] it declared it he has eliminated the son
[2:34:44] of jesus
[2:34:46] but here was the son of jesus being
[2:34:48] given the privilege
[2:34:49] to deal with his enemy twice
[2:34:54] with the way you know so do you think
[2:34:56] saul can be that careless
[2:34:58] it was a supernatural sleep god put him
[2:35:02] under anesthesia
[2:35:03] in order to test david come on friends
[2:35:09] you that somebody drove rough at you in
[2:35:11] the traffic and you want to get even
[2:35:13] with him
[2:35:14] you must do it but you are not ready for
[2:35:15] your placement
[2:35:19] you that are still tribal by gods
[2:35:23] a lot of tribal by gods in the message
[2:35:26] there's so much boost about a tribe or a
[2:35:29] country
[2:35:30] as if that country will be in eternity
[2:35:33] only christians will be in eternity
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:35] [Applause]
[2:35:37] there's no tribe no nation under heaven
[2:35:40] that is good take it from me
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:44] every nation has an evil spirit
[2:35:48] listen to me every nation
[2:35:51] you go to some places and say oh we are
[2:35:53] worried of these certain people
[2:35:54] as if they don't have their problem they
[2:35:56] have worse problems
[2:35:58] some may have a forward night defrauding
[2:36:00] syndrome some their immorality is out of
[2:36:02] this world
[2:36:04] is the same demon do you know why
[2:36:07] nations go to war
[2:36:08] the prophet says when those evil spirits
[2:36:10] of all nations get jealous among
[2:36:12] themselves
[2:36:14] they become envious of each other it's
[2:36:16] like you are doing too much damage
[2:36:18] and they go to war that's a spiritual
[2:36:21] that's a spiritual explanation for war
[2:36:25] so don't boast in those nonsense
[2:36:28] amen i am not a nigerian i don't know if
[2:36:31] you're a ghanaian
[2:36:32] i don't know if you're a trinidadian or
[2:36:34] an american whatever
[2:36:35] as long as you are one of such people
[2:36:37] you can never narrate the kingdom of god
[2:36:39] you are still flesh and blood
[2:36:44] heaven is only meant for evilness by the
[2:36:47] spirit of god
[2:36:48] i have i have changed citizenship a
[2:36:51] peculiar people
[2:36:53] hallelujah royal priesthood
[2:36:56] a holy nation
[2:36:58] [Applause]
[2:37:00] for any all the stones that built the
[2:37:03] temple
[2:37:04] of the great temple of solomon came from
[2:37:07] all the nations of the earth
[2:37:09] if they all came with their tribal
[2:37:11] national identities
[2:37:12] they will have no fitting place in the
[2:37:14] body they lost teach
[2:37:16] hallelujah and became one with the
[2:37:19] temple
[2:37:20] lose all your nationalities and become
[2:37:22] one with it
[2:37:24] with the temple with the body of christ
[2:37:28] i want a christian and nothing more let
[2:37:31] him be any tribe legend be any nation
[2:37:33] as long as he's a christian that's good
[2:37:36] enough for me
[2:37:38] because without that you cannot be
[2:37:40] pleased
[2:37:41] you go nowhere you say
[2:37:44] in this message of the hour can see
[2:37:46] people and people be like that they are
[2:37:47] all over everywhere
[2:37:51] so jaundice in their thinking may god
[2:37:54] help us church
[2:37:56] hallelujah you see why mark 11 said you
[2:38:00] can move your mountain
[2:38:03] if god will say amen it takes a son who
[2:38:07] is
[2:38:07] joining his narrative who is placing his
[2:38:10] blessings to be moving mountain
[2:38:12] but he said before you start moving your
[2:38:14] mountain if you have ought against any
[2:38:18] thoughtful manifestation comes with
[2:38:20] forgiveness
[2:38:22] a lot of you have unforgiving spirits
[2:38:24] and you want to come into adoption
[2:38:26] you won't be placed nowhere hallelujah
[2:38:31] he said if you have voted against any
[2:38:33] forgive
[2:38:37] look at david my
[2:38:41] for david to even get an evidence
[2:38:45] which is on one occasion he took the
[2:38:47] spear of the king that was at the bus
[2:38:49] of his head to show how close he came on
[2:38:52] another occasion he caught a garment
[2:38:55] for david to even cut that garment look
[2:38:58] at what the bible said he said is
[2:39:00] outsmart him
[2:39:02] cutting the garment of the anointed and
[2:39:04] that is a man who will kill him
[2:39:08] you that talk to god's anointed anyhow
[2:39:14] it is not the character of children of
[2:39:17] god
[2:39:19] it is the children of the other side
[2:39:21] that talk anyhow
[2:39:23] the speech of god's children preparing
[2:39:26] for their blessing
[2:39:27] is always seasoned it's a michael white
[2:39:31] disputing gabriel or michael
[2:39:32] white disputing over the body of moses
[2:39:35] did not uh
[2:39:37] micah did not bring a railing accusation
[2:39:39] he wasn't
[2:39:40] abusive on the devil he only said the
[2:39:44] lord rebuked it
[2:39:46] but you are becoming abusive you talking
[2:39:49] here you talk vulgar
[2:39:50] come on friends you don't even do that
[2:39:53] on the unbeliever
[2:39:54] not to talk of the lord's anointing
[2:39:56] michael never did that to satan
[2:39:59] as satanic as he was
[2:40:05] it's brought his art to cut the garment
[2:40:07] but he needed an evidence
[2:40:11] then finally the ziggler experience
[2:40:14] you remember it
[2:40:17] whatever happened let's leave it i want
[2:40:19] to cut it short so we can go
[2:40:22] but the fact was that when they came
[2:40:23] back from trying to help the philistines
[2:40:26] who were the landlords
[2:40:27] they met all their families already gone
[2:40:30] they
[2:40:30] learned everything they worked for wiped
[2:40:32] away
[2:40:34] those who are not ready for adoption
[2:40:36] started fighting and talking
[2:40:39] ready to stone david talking anyhow
[2:40:44] it was a time of pressure like solomon
[2:40:46] heart read that scripture
[2:40:48] nobody seemed to be for david again as
[2:40:51] great
[2:40:52] a person he was to them as great a
[2:40:54] leader has been
[2:40:55] they must have told him you mean i'm
[2:40:57] going to lose my wife and my children
[2:40:59] and not that i've ever worked for
[2:41:01] david get next to yourself you better do
[2:41:03] something about this
[2:41:04] otherwise i'll deal with you over 400
[2:41:07] men
[2:41:07] we are praying on david to do something
[2:41:10] otherwise they will kill him
[2:41:12] tell me about pressure
[2:41:16] but what did the bible told me he said
[2:41:19] but david encouraged himself
[2:41:23] in the lord is god
[2:41:26] amen do you know what that means he
[2:41:29] began to remember the promises of god
[2:41:32] he began to remember the word of god he
[2:41:35] knows that even when everything fails
[2:41:37] the word cannot fail
[2:41:38] started saying don't worry brothers
[2:41:40] let's relax brother god is in control
[2:41:42] all will be well which all will be well
[2:41:44] which one will be where
[2:41:45] do we withdraw i need i want my wife and
[2:41:47] my children oh we'll be well calm down
[2:41:49] brother
[2:41:50] come down calm down when he got him to
[2:41:53] question down the beach
[2:41:54] you would think david will rise up and
[2:41:56] say let's go to one get our people
[2:41:59] not david the bride knows what to do
[2:42:02] with the world
[2:42:04] the gates don't share the lord or they
[2:42:06] keep still
[2:42:08] think about that you can be under such
[2:42:09] circumstances sometimes
[2:42:11] this is the character you must follow
[2:42:14] something's all hard
[2:42:15] but look at david the next thing they
[2:42:17] asked for bring me the effort
[2:42:19] another must have said is it a matter of
[2:42:21] effort is it a matter of the word now
[2:42:24] or preaching will not be switched until
[2:42:26] i see my wife and my children
[2:42:28] do something though i'm giving you time
[2:42:30] this stone in my hand
[2:42:31] must land on somebody today david
[2:42:36] now but this is what i thought about it
[2:42:39] the effort
[2:42:40] and the therapy is what the priest used
[2:42:42] to contact god to know his will
[2:42:46] david still wanted the will of god
[2:42:50] [Music]
[2:42:52] above any consideration in that terrible
[2:42:56] situation
[2:42:58] imagine what if god had said don't do
[2:43:00] anything about it
[2:43:01] leave it is my hand do you think david
[2:43:04] will do something
[2:43:05] he will have spoken like job of old the
[2:43:08] lord gave it
[2:43:09] the lord take it bless sir be his holy
[2:43:12] name
[2:43:13] even at the risk of his own life he will
[2:43:15] do what the word says
[2:43:17] your conduct around the world your
[2:43:19] obedience your attitude
[2:43:21] determines your placement
[2:43:22] [Music]
[2:43:22] [Applause]
[2:43:27] god hold no david so you know what
[2:43:31] push you overtake
[2:43:34] and recover or
[2:43:37] charge pursue overtake
[2:43:41] and recover all
[2:43:44] in the name of jesus christ
[2:43:51] let's stay with the wedge that is the
[2:43:53] condition
[2:43:54] for manifestation the two thomas give
[2:43:58] good remarks
[2:44:00] and as the world begin to walk upon the
[2:44:02] atoms of our body
[2:44:03] as we receive it coming
[2:44:07] under obedience it will be shaping us
[2:44:10] one day our father will look at us
[2:44:14] and see us perfectly reflecting him
[2:44:17] even in our smiles in our courage
[2:44:21] in our mean in our stature
[2:44:24] in our appearance and he said this one
[2:44:28] as for this one enter into your
[2:44:30] inheritance
[2:44:32] you are a son but be placing your
[2:44:34] position
[2:44:35] and through you a quick short work will
[2:44:38] be done in this world
[2:44:40] you won't live here quietly god must
[2:44:43] wave you
[2:44:44] god must vindicate you and then we shall
[2:44:47] go
[2:44:47] for a total change and ever be with our
[2:44:50] lord
[2:44:51] shalom to the bread of christ god bless
