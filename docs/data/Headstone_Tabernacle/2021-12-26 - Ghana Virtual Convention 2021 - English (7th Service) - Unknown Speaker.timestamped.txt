[37:54] is going to be like some will be in
[37:56] daylight some will be at night but
[37:58] nonetheless we'll all catch uh we'll be
[38:00] caught away in a moment in twinkling of
[38:02] an hour certainly looking forward to
[38:03] that the quote goes on to say um
[38:06] it'll be night one place daylight on the
[38:08] other side of earth be a universal
[38:10] resurrection that rapture
[38:12] the trumpet of god shall sound and every
[38:14] one of these of this little church here
[38:16] here here and even that little bunch
[38:19] that went through there and come out
[38:20] here here here
[38:22] says when that virgin
[38:25] that virgin when she's seen it uh in the
[38:28] seventh seen it seen in the seventh
[38:30] watch now you remember there were seven
[38:33] virgins is that right
[38:35] or i mean five virgins went out ten
[38:37] virgins went out to meet the lord five
[38:39] was wise and five was foolish i love the
[38:42] way
[38:43] this quote is actually coming to us i
[38:45] think we can see things and what the
[38:47] prophet was telling us uh here we when
[38:50] we read the scripture we know it's ten
[38:51] virgins but when he said there were
[38:54] seven uh i don't think that we uh have
[38:57] to look at that to to as a slip of the
[38:59] tongue uh we can see something that he's
[39:01] saying there because there was there's
[39:02] been seven church ages and that virgin
[39:05] is represented through those seven
[39:06] church ages that's why he said and that
[39:09] bunch here here there there you know
[39:12] here we are in that seventh church age
[39:13] and there's something that we're looking
[39:14] forward to uh at the at in this age so
[39:17] let's keep on reading it says ten
[39:19] virgins went out to meet the lord five
[39:21] was wives and five was foolish is that
[39:24] right it says now in those watches
[39:26] though there was seven watches see seven
[39:28] church ages it says and at the end of
[39:31] the seventh watch some slept from this
[39:32] watch this one this one this one uh and
[39:35] that the seventh watch there was a voice
[39:38] went out behold the bridegroom cometh go
[39:42] ye out to meet him and i and i love the
[39:45] scripture uh as as i stated here in this
[39:48] quote we'll read it in matthew 25 but we
[39:50] have a responsibility we must go out to
[39:53] meet him amen and they rose and trimmed
[39:56] their lamps and all these others rose
[39:59] down here down down here oh won't that
[40:02] be a wonderful time so lamp trimming
[40:05] time
[40:06] for me is a wonderful thought for us to
[40:08] reflect upon i believe it's very
[40:11] appropriate for the season in which we
[40:12] live i believe we're living in the
[40:15] coming of the lord the hour
[40:18] is late and the rapture is at hand
[40:22] and i believe this when we recognize
[40:24] the lateness of the hour in which we
[40:25] live
[40:26] it invokes a response just as the
[40:29] scripture told us there in matthew 25 uh
[40:32] it says they they went up go you out to
[40:35] meet them so they got up they went out
[40:36] to meet them not only that they trimmed
[40:38] their lamps amen brother branham tells
[40:41] us in some places where
[40:43] where we should have oil in that lamp
[40:45] for it to burn representing the holy
[40:47] spirit
[40:48] too many people have water in their
[40:50] lamps we want to make sure we don't have
[40:52] water we want to make sure we have oil
[40:54] in this hour matthew 25 verse 6 through
[40:57] 9
[40:58] is where
[40:59] the thought is coming from and again
[41:00] salute the pastor
[41:02] on his inspiration for this he says at
[41:04] midnight there was a crime
[41:06] made behold the black room cometh go ye
[41:08] out to meet him verse 7 that all those
[41:11] virgins arose and trim their lamps and
[41:15] the foolish said unto the wise
[41:17] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[41:20] going out
[41:21] but the wise answer saying not so
[41:24] lest there be not enough for us and you
[41:26] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[41:29] buy for yourselves when you read the
[41:30] rest of the scripture you recognize that
[41:32] as they went to buy the bridegroom came
[41:36] and they were they missed amen the
[41:38] coming of the bridegroom we don't want
[41:40] to miss amen the coming amen of our
[41:42] bridegroom in this hour we also don't
[41:45] want to miss his appearing amen and i
[41:47] want to just uh uh
[41:49] uh help us to understand because brother
[41:51] branham told us that the appearing of
[41:54] the lord and the coming of the lord are
[41:56] two different things
[41:58] however i want to state that uh
[42:00] we if we if we uh could recognize his
[42:04] appearing
[42:05] then we will be seeing a sign of his
[42:07] coming
[42:08] amen and if we can catch the appearing
[42:11] it is great it's a great probability
[42:14] that we'll also catch
[42:16] the coming notice what the prophet says
[42:18] here in the message uh the end time
[42:21] evangelism notice this quote here it
[42:24] says same thing today
[42:27] when you see his work now we have
[42:29] already seen and are witnessing the
[42:32] appearing of the lord now remember
[42:35] appearing and coming is two different
[42:38] words uh to appear and then to come
[42:41] now is the appearing he's already
[42:45] appeared in these last days
[42:47] right here with us in the last few years
[42:51] now it's a sign of his coming so his
[42:53] appearing is actually a sign and if you
[42:56] can catch the appearing then it's a high
[42:58] probability that you would catch the
[43:00] coming see now it's the sign of his
[43:02] coming he's appearing in his church in
[43:04] the form of the holy spirit showing that
[43:06] it's him
[43:08] because people
[43:09] because people
[43:11] cannot do these things that you see the
[43:12] holy spirit doing so that's the
[43:14] appearing of the lord now remember it
[43:17] spoke both places appearing and coming
[43:20] we can see that the lord jesus has
[43:22] appeared in the ministry of his prophet
[43:25] but we can also see that the lord jesus
[43:28] has appeared and is appearing in the
[43:31] ministry of his bride amen as we wait
[43:34] for his coming the appearing is a sign
[43:37] of his coming
[43:39] glory to god uh the scripture tells us
[43:42] in matthew 25 verse 7 the the then all
[43:46] those virgins arose
[43:48] and trim their lamps and if there was
[43:49] ever time for us to arise and turn my
[43:52] lamps that time is now
[43:55] uh
[43:56] we must get the water out
[43:58] get the spirit in the war rip water
[44:00] represents the things of the world the
[44:02] oil is the holy spirit we need more of
[44:05] the holy spirit we can never preach
[44:07] enough about the holy ghost we want to
[44:09] make sure we're sealed amen until the
[44:11] day of our redemption we must be
[44:13] diligent in this hour for it is in this
[44:16] watch that the cry goes forth behold the
[44:20] bridegroom cometh
[44:22] go ye out to meet him
[44:25] this
[44:26] is a time the second coming of the lord
[44:28] and we're living under the promise of
[44:31] this coming i want to read a quote here
[44:34] amen as i close my thought here out of
[44:36] the message spirit of truth
[44:38] the prophet says this in a prayer
[44:41] it says we would ask thee heavenly
[44:43] father
[44:44] to remember us
[44:46] tonight now for those amen that are
[44:49] watching the service in the daytime i'll
[44:51] say
[44:52] remember us today
[44:54] and if there be any evil in us
[44:57] take it out lord
[44:59] uh tonight or today that we might be
[45:02] presentable to thee if you should come
[45:05] tonight or today because that this
[45:07] rapture is a universal rapture
[45:09] it says we pray for the sick and needy
[45:12] we pray for the church both here
[45:15] and abroad around the world
[45:19] thy children everywhere of every nation
[45:22] that we may wash our robes in the blood
[45:24] of the lamb and listening for that call
[45:28] behold
[45:29] the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet
[45:32] him
[45:33] may we be able at that time lord by the
[45:35] grace of god and by the merits of jesus
[45:38] who we trust him to trim our lamps and
[45:41] go forward then to meet the bridegroom
[45:43] take the word of the lord and circumcise
[45:46] our hearts
[45:47] take all our unbelief out
[45:49] give us a great service and i pray that
[45:52] over these meetings lord give a great

[48:54] and his wife had made herself ready
[48:58] and to her was granted that she should
[48:59] be already fine leaning clean and white
[49:04] for the fine linen is a righteousness of
[49:07] sense
[49:09] and he said unto me
[49:11] right
[49:12] blessed are they which are called unto
[49:15] the mother supper of the lamb
[49:17] and he said unto me
[49:19] these are the true saiyans of god

[49:24] written of his words
[49:26] so friends
[49:28] revelation 10
[49:31] is our very familiar scripture
[49:34] and um
[49:35] we saw the mighty angel come down from
[49:37] heaven
[49:38] gloated with a cloud and a rainbow was
[49:40] upon his head and his face was as it's
[49:42] weird the sun and his face at his feet
[49:44] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[49:47] hand a little book open
[49:50] amen and he set his right foot upon the
[49:52] sea and his left foot on the earth
[49:54] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[49:57] lion ruled it
[49:59] and when he had cried then seven
[50:01] thunders ought their voices and when the
[50:03] seven thunders has ordered their voices
[50:06] i was about to write
[50:08] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[50:09] unto me
[50:10] seal up those things with the seven
[50:12] thunders had uttered and write them not
[50:16] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[50:18] sea and upon the earth
[50:19] lifted up his hand to heaven and
[50:21] swabbing him that liver forever and ever
[50:24] who created heaven and a taste that
[50:27] darina and the earth are the things that
[50:29] darina and the sea and the things which
[50:32] are daring that there should be time no

[51:05] sounding of the last trumpet

[51:20] in the message the back of the beast and
[51:22] the seal of god

[51:45] brother and sister
[51:46] what is what is the sign of it
[51:50] is a sign we are at the end time
[51:53] what did jesus say about the sleeping
[51:55] virgins
[51:56] he said oh you call them churches
[51:58] virgins just like ken was
[52:01] exactly the same thing
[52:02] they worship
[52:04] but a sleeping virgin has no oil in her
[52:07] lamp
[52:08] that's a difference
[52:10] they have no oil in their lamb is that
[52:12] right so when she found out she was
[52:14] later than what she thought
[52:17] communism sleeping up on her she said oh
[52:20] give us some of the oil
[52:23] give us some of the oils they are
[52:24] worshippers too
[52:26] see
[52:27] how do you get this holy ghost
[52:31] then he said go buy it for
[52:33] from one that sells it
[52:35] and he said i remember the very time the
[52:38] sleeping virgins went to buy the oil
[52:40] that's when the bridegroom came
[52:43] glory don't you see it
[52:45] if the presbyterians and their peace
[52:47] corps parents and those others are
[52:49] coming and
[52:51] or those others are come seeking for the
[52:54] holy ghost

[53:30] a believer
[53:31] a man is a weak he's a look he's got a
[53:35] fire on one end up here
[53:38] and the other end is deep into oil
[53:42] drawing oil and making fire oh glory

[53:55] shines in the east
[53:56] is shining in the west

[54:03] that's the pride
[54:05] amen trim your lambs amen that's the
[54:07] bright core that's the holy spirit
[54:09] calling out to the bride dream your labs

[54:27] said when they go looking for that oil
[54:30] that's the time
[54:31] and he said and right when they went to
[54:34] get this what happened what taking place
[54:36] then the bridegroom went in
[54:39] see america has blasphemed the holy
[54:41] ghost she's made fun of it ever since
[54:43] she calmed on the scene of existence 40
[54:46] or 50 years ago she's got constantly
[54:49] made from the other churches has made
[54:51] fun they have showed themselves
[54:53] now they begin to stick their head out
[54:56] and saying we would like to have a
[54:59] little of this but just as when they go
[55:01] to doing that
[55:03] is a sign that we should go to trimming
[55:06] our lamps
[55:08] god raise up some preachers
[55:10] god raise up some preachers that we go
[55:12] to dreaming lambs i'm telling you what
[55:15] we need today is something that we trim
[55:18] our lambs
[55:19] praise god
[55:20] show the true pentecostal fire the
[55:23] original holy spirit pointing out amen
[55:28] i'm making the bride ready see you get
[55:31] an old lamb little lamb
[55:33] oh where the carbon gets on this on the
[55:36] lamp week it will smoke your lamp all up
[55:39] that's what is the matter with us we got
[55:41] too much carbon on the lamps too much
[55:43] carbon the fire can't drop right
[55:47] it can't can't get enough air from the
[55:49] bottom
[55:50] what we need is a good breathing spell
[55:54] a good breath
[55:56] fresh breath
[55:57] from heaven of the baptism of the holy
[56:00] ghost over again and the holy spirit
[56:03] walking in the church with signs and
[56:05] wonders following the true seal of god
[56:08] and that's what we are contending for
[56:10] the true seal of god the same holy
[56:13] spirit the same original power that fell
[56:16] under the pentagons and if there's the
[56:18] same holy spirit it will bring the same
[56:20] results
[56:21] it will bring the same action it will be
[56:23] the same manifestation
[56:25] because that is god a god cannot change
[56:29] praise the lord
[56:30] and the prophet said we need a fresh
[56:32] bread from heaven of the baptism of the
[56:35] holy ghost over again and the holy
[56:37] spirit working in the church amen lamp
[56:40] dreaming time praise god
[56:43] hallelujah
[56:44] lumped him in time fresh bread we know
[56:47] how he fell on them under the pentecost
[56:50] amen the holy spirit jesus had already
[56:52] preached on them i said receive the holy
[56:55] ghost amen but under the pentecost why
[56:58] do we are all gathered in one mind and
[57:00] one accord just like we have gathered in
[57:02] this convention one mind and one accord
[57:05] then all of a sudden there came a sound
[57:08] from heaven like a rushing mighty wind a
[57:11] that bread that that's that bread that
[57:14] went forth in the book of saint john 20
[57:16] became a russian mighty wind under the
[57:19] pentagons and then baptized the people
[57:21] over again and the prophet said that's
[57:23] what we need a fresh bread good
[57:26] breakfast of a good bread
[57:29] bread fresh bread from heaven of the
[57:32] baptism of the holy ghost over again and
[57:35] the holy spirit walking in the church
[57:38] with signs and wonders
[57:40] following the truth following the true
[57:43] seal of god hallelujah he said i tell
[57:46] you what i'll go to the assemblies if

[1:10:20] behold there stood a man over against
[1:10:22] him with a sword drawing his hand

[1:10:27] him

[1:10:32] and he said nay
[1:10:34] but as captain of the host of the lord

[1:10:40] and did worship and said unto him

[1:14:13] on the topic called out
[1:14:16] called out
[1:14:18] now brother branham told us and let us
[1:14:20] know that the church
[1:14:21] is
[1:14:23] god's call that group
[1:14:24] and just like with everything god does
[1:14:27] he always has a shadow
[1:14:29] and a full type in the old testament
[1:14:32] and so israel
[1:14:34] in egypt
[1:14:35] in bondage in egypt for 430 years
[1:14:39] and then brought out of egypt by god's
[1:14:41] stronger mighty hand is the shadow of
[1:14:43] the church
[1:14:44] is the top of the church
[1:14:46] is god for showing and foreshadowing the
[1:14:49] church before the church
[1:14:50] will ever come understand in the new
[1:14:52] testament
[1:14:53] and so
[1:14:56] israel's saw john in egypt and how god
[1:14:59] brought them out by the mighty and
[1:15:01] powerful hand
[1:15:02] and then took them into the promised
[1:15:04] land as he spoke to abram their father
[1:15:08] the teachers uh are um um
[1:15:12] three basic fundamental things that
[1:15:14] whole story of israel's bondage in egypt
[1:15:18] and their deliverance and eventual
[1:15:20] you know our journey to the promised
[1:15:22] land teachers number one
[1:15:25] the basic foundations of our christian
[1:15:27] faith
[1:15:28] are all laid in there
[1:15:31] late in there
[1:15:32] number two
[1:15:34] it teaches about the journey of the new
[1:15:36] testament church
[1:15:39] of which we are a part
[1:15:41] and number three
[1:15:43] it teaches about
[1:15:44] the glorious promises of god
[1:15:47] for this
[1:15:49] end time bride in this closing days of
[1:15:51] time
[1:15:53] all of these are contained in that story
[1:15:56] of israel in bondage come out of bondage
[1:15:59] their journey through the wilderness and
[1:16:01] their journey
[1:16:02] entering the promised land and the
[1:16:03] scripture i read joshua one is israel on
[1:16:06] the verge of entering into the promised
[1:16:08] land
[1:16:08] and you see joshua that was commissioned
[1:16:11] and joshua's commission was threefold
[1:16:13] number one take them across jordan
[1:16:16] into the land number two
[1:16:19] possess subdue and possess the land
[1:16:22] wherever the souls of your feet shall
[1:16:26] tread that place i've already given to
[1:16:28] you footprints mean possession
[1:16:31] subdue and poses the light now number
[1:16:34] three joshua's commission was divide the
[1:16:37] land to the people
[1:16:40] put them in their places in the land
[1:16:43] personally place them in the land so
[1:16:45] they can finally have a place of race
[1:16:48] that they can call their own
[1:16:50] because these were people who had been
[1:16:52] bonded in egypt for so long there was
[1:16:55] foreigners sojourners slaves in a
[1:16:57] foreign land
[1:16:58] and so they could not lay claim to any
[1:17:00] part of the land and so god wanted to
[1:17:03] take them out by his mighty hand to take
[1:17:05] them into their own land to where they
[1:17:07] would have their own land and be able to
[1:17:09] build their own homes and be able to
[1:17:11] live an inheritance for their children
[1:17:13] and generations after them
[1:17:15] that's the whole story god was going to
[1:17:18] take them into this place of rest
[1:17:21] physical race to where they will build
[1:17:24] and have their own land their own
[1:17:26] inheritance they can pass on down to
[1:17:28] their children and their children's
[1:17:30] children and generations after them
[1:17:33] so this story of israel in bondage
[1:17:36] teaches us
[1:17:37] these things
[1:17:39] with regards to the new testament
[1:17:41] church
[1:17:43] now israel was called out of egypt and
[1:17:47] they went on a journey
[1:17:49] so israel is always a type of the church
[1:17:52] brother branham taurus and bible readers
[1:17:54] everywhere know that
[1:17:56] israel is a type of the church
[1:17:59] always so israel on a journey is the
[1:18:02] church on a journey israel's journey
[1:18:04] from
[1:18:05] from egypt to canaan land the promised
[1:18:08] land
[1:18:08] is representative of the churches
[1:18:11] journey from the world into glory
[1:18:19] israel's journey
[1:18:21] was a walk with god
[1:18:23] because it was a journey designed by god
[1:18:25] himself
[1:18:26] and working with god takes faith because
[1:18:29] you only walk with god by faith so
[1:18:31] israel's journey was a work of faith
[1:18:33] fundamentals to a christian belief
[1:18:37] israel's journey was a work of faith our
[1:18:39] journey christian journey is a work of
[1:18:42] faith
[1:18:46] israel abrams
[1:18:49] are a natural seed
[1:18:51] the church abram's spiritual seed
[1:18:54] working with god by faith
[1:19:00] israel
[1:19:03] left the promised land
[1:19:05] and left egypt rather
[1:19:07] 2 million strong
[1:19:10] 2 million strong
[1:19:13] it was a collective journey
[1:19:16] but then that collective was made up of
[1:19:18] individuals who made up the
[1:19:20] collective it was a group of two million
[1:19:23] but individuals made the account
[1:19:26] for
[1:19:29] that group
[1:19:32] the same way
[1:19:34] the church on its journey
[1:19:36] is a collective
[1:19:38] is a group
[1:19:39] is a unit together
[1:19:42] but individuals
[1:19:43] must also
[1:19:45] do their work in this journey
[1:19:50] is a work of faith for a group is a work
[1:19:52] of faith for individuals
[1:19:54] the church is made up of individuals who
[1:19:56] make up the church
[1:19:59] i know what brother branham said
[1:20:02] the way he builds his church is the way
[1:20:04] he builds his individuals you cannot
[1:20:05] separate them
[1:20:07] and you'll understand that when we get
[1:20:09] the promised land when each one has to
[1:20:11] have their individual inheritance
[1:20:13] he gives the tribes their inheritance
[1:20:15] but individuals have got to have their
[1:20:17] inheritance like
[1:20:19] caleb went to joshua and said give me my
[1:20:21] mountain he asked for his own individual
[1:20:24] inheritance because he understood that
[1:20:27] we're a group but then i'm also an
[1:20:29] individual because that's how god deals
[1:20:31] with us
[1:20:32] not as a group but as an individual but
[1:20:34] together
[1:20:36] we must be together as a group
[1:20:38] to form the church
[1:20:40] and no one in the church
[1:20:42] is a is an island unto himself it's
[1:20:45] going to be a unit together
[1:20:47] but each one in that group
[1:20:49] must work their work with god
[1:20:52] and that's the mystery of a christian
[1:20:54] church
[1:20:56] a collective made up of different
[1:20:58] individuals
[1:20:59] and that's why in revelation
[1:21:01] chapters one of three one talks about
[1:21:03] the church ages
[1:21:04] and he said
[1:21:07] to he that hath an heir once speaking to
[1:21:10] each of the church ages to heal the have
[1:21:12] an air let him hear not to them to he
[1:21:15] even though he's speaking to the church
[1:21:18] but he addressed it to the individuals
[1:21:20] he talked about what they did wrong as a
[1:21:23] group
[1:21:24] but he addressed the admonition
[1:21:27] to listen to obey to do to act upon
[1:21:30] god's word to the individuals
[1:21:34] so these are fundamentals of a christian
[1:21:35] belief and that's why you see in the
[1:21:36] book of acts when the church bust on the
[1:21:39] scene it was a unity
[1:21:41] they were banned together they were
[1:21:43] unity together but then each one was in
[1:21:46] that group working with god on their own
[1:21:49] and you've got to walk with god
[1:21:52] you can walk with god like our church is
[1:21:54] working with god you've got to have your
[1:21:56] own individual work with god
[1:22:00] so
[1:22:02] israel
[1:22:04] are are
[1:22:05] went on a journey and the church is on a
[1:22:07] journey from the day of pentecost
[1:22:10] to a glory land
[1:22:12] that's what
[1:22:13] israel's journey represented for the
[1:22:15] church
[1:22:17] now let's get a lesson here
[1:22:21] in the journey of israel we can divide
[1:22:23] two
[1:22:24] clear segments
[1:22:26] out of egypt in the wilderness
[1:22:28] and
[1:22:32] from the
[1:22:33] wilderness into the promised land across
[1:22:35] the jordan river
[1:22:38] so you have the first portion 40 years
[1:22:40] in the wilderness
[1:22:42] and the second portion
[1:22:44] cross over jordan
[1:22:46] into
[1:22:47] the promised land
[1:22:48] the first half moses took them through
[1:22:51] the second half joshua was commissioned
[1:22:54] to took them to take them through
[1:22:55] the joshua commission that's what we
[1:22:57] read
[1:22:58] in
[1:22:59] joshua 1.
[1:23:06] so
[1:23:08] haven't said all of this
[1:23:11] let's notice a few patterns here
[1:23:15] you can see
[1:23:18] if there's so many more but
[1:23:20] just to mention these few
[1:23:24] fundamentals of our faith that you can
[1:23:26] find in egypt
[1:23:29] i mean you'll find the children of
[1:23:32] of israel in egypt
[1:23:34] when they were called out
[1:23:36] in the wilderness i will talk about some
[1:23:38] more of those things
[1:23:40] and these things were written for
[1:23:41] example
[1:23:43] so that we'll know how not to be
[1:23:46] and will know how to be
[1:23:48] so that will not fail after the same
[1:23:51] manner
[1:23:52] of example that they failed
[1:23:55] now if i mean let me just quickly read
[1:23:57] here my conduct scripture
[1:24:00] um
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:04] hebrews chapter 3
[1:24:07] verse 7 through verse 11
[1:24:10] wherefore
[1:24:11] as the holy ghost saith
[1:24:13] today
[1:24:15] if you will hear his voice hiding knock
[1:24:17] your hearts as in the provocation
[1:24:20] in the day of temptation in the
[1:24:21] wilderness
[1:24:22] that's the 40 years
[1:24:24] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[1:24:27] and saw my works 40 years there you are
[1:24:32] wherefore i was grieved
[1:24:35] i was angry i was annoyed
[1:24:39] with that generation
[1:24:41] and said
[1:24:43] they do always err
[1:24:46] in their heart in other words their
[1:24:48] hearts are never right towards me
[1:24:52] they're always doing wrong stuff in
[1:24:54] their hearts their heart is not clean
[1:24:56] towards me their heart is not willing to
[1:24:59] obey my word
[1:25:02] they do always air in my in their heart
[1:25:04] and when they're doing their hearts
[1:25:06] first
[1:25:06] of course it's automatic they'll do it
[1:25:08] on the outside but even if they don't do
[1:25:10] it on the outside once it's in their
[1:25:12] heart god looks upon the intents and
[1:25:17] the desires of the heart
[1:25:19] we judge the actions but god george is
[1:25:21] the intent of the heart and so god said
[1:25:24] because they do air in their heart
[1:25:26] and they have not known my ways so i
[1:25:29] swore in my wrath
[1:25:32] they shall not enter into my rest in
[1:25:35] other words they shall not get into the
[1:25:36] promised land the place of rest where
[1:25:39] they are going to rest from all labors
[1:25:42] and they're going to have their
[1:25:43] inheritance that they can pass on down
[1:25:44] to their children and their children and
[1:25:46] their generations after them god swore
[1:25:50] now
[1:25:52] when god took israel out of egypt
[1:25:55] it was supposed to be and the journey
[1:25:57] was
[1:25:58] to come out of egypt to a land god made
[1:26:01] that plane and clear to them that was
[1:26:03] the journey that was the plan
[1:26:05] clear not ambiguous not a single
[1:26:09] ambiguity about it was crystal clear
[1:26:12] plane
[1:26:14] they were coming out
[1:26:16] and going on a journey to the promised
[1:26:18] land
[1:26:19] and every journey of faith is like that
[1:26:21] when god called their father abraham he
[1:26:23] called him come out of the all the
[1:26:25] colleagues to a land i'm going to show
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:28] and everyone on abraham walked with god
[1:26:30] like that
[1:26:32] and so many examples in the life of
[1:26:34] abraham so many examples in isaac's life
[1:26:36] so many examples
[1:26:38] it's a journey
[1:26:40] and the journey always has a destination
[1:26:43] but when these people came out
[1:26:46] they behaved as though the destination
[1:26:48] was the wilderness
[1:26:49] now here was god's three-point plan
[1:26:53] number one call them out of egypt
[1:26:56] from egypt have i called my son would
[1:26:59] you refer that to jacob israel but also
[1:27:01] refer that to christ the messiah when he
[1:27:04] was sent to egypt with his parents when
[1:27:07] herod was looking to kill him
[1:27:10] i called my son out of
[1:27:13] egypt
[1:27:14] that's number one call them out and then
[1:27:16] number two
[1:27:17] god had a plan to take them through the
[1:27:20] wilderness god told moses don't take
[1:27:22] them by that way but take them by the
[1:27:24] amid god
[1:27:26] to where
[1:27:28] they are gonna go and not be able to run
[1:27:31] back to egypt if they see
[1:27:35] war on the way because god knew their
[1:27:37] hearts
[1:27:39] that some of these people were not
[1:27:40] intent on going all the way to the
[1:27:43] promised land
[1:27:44] they were leaving egypt but egypt was
[1:27:46] following them so god did not want them
[1:27:49] to go back to egypt
[1:27:51] god was making it difficult difficult
[1:27:54] for them to not live a christian life it
[1:27:56] was god was making it easier for them to
[1:27:58] live a christian life than to live
[1:28:01] like
[1:28:02] unbelievers back in egypt
[1:28:06] it's not hard living a christian life
[1:28:09] it's harder living
[1:28:11] an unbelievable life
[1:28:13] i'm not saying it's easy
[1:28:15] to live a christian life because the
[1:28:16] enemy fights
[1:28:18] but it's harder
[1:28:20] living as an unbeliever it's harder
[1:28:22] living as a sidewinder and going back
[1:28:25] is harder
[1:28:27] because
[1:28:28] the way of a transgression
[1:28:30] is hard
[1:28:32] life is hard life is not easy life is
[1:28:35] not a
[1:28:36] piece of cake a cakewalk no
[1:28:39] ask the ask the baby that's born that
[1:28:42] baby in the comfort of his mother's womb
[1:28:45] it comes out comfortable but once it
[1:28:48] comes out it understands right away
[1:28:50] first second on earth here is a
[1:28:53] different ballgame here
[1:28:56] different environment the pressure
[1:28:58] changes and that baby
[1:29:00] um
[1:29:02] cries that cry is what makes it live if
[1:29:04] he didn't cry
[1:29:06] in he cried in response to the change of
[1:29:08] pressure if he didn't cry it was dead on
[1:29:10] arrival
[1:29:12] so even though the changing pressure
[1:29:14] looked like it's something that's not
[1:29:15] good for the baby but he got the baby to
[1:29:17] leave
[1:29:19] and that's what this work of faith does
[1:29:23] it caused the things that be not as
[1:29:24] though they are it defies the regular it
[1:29:28] defies the conventional it looks a
[1:29:30] things from god's eye
[1:29:32] the way god says the word god says
[1:29:34] that's what it is
[1:29:36] and so israel on this journey here
[1:29:39] god called them out number one
[1:29:42] and number two they were to be nourished
[1:29:45] and fed and tutored
[1:29:48] in the wilderness
[1:29:50] and at the same time they were to be
[1:29:52] given their pro they were to god was
[1:29:54] going to keep the promise of the
[1:29:56] promised land right before them so they
[1:29:59] will be able to like be
[1:30:01] have their focus
[1:30:03] to what they're going to where they're
[1:30:05] going so that they will not think about
[1:30:07] going back
[1:30:10] and number three
[1:30:12] they will get in the land
[1:30:14] that was the plan simple plan
[1:30:19] you say
[1:30:20] why did god have to and this was going
[1:30:22] to take
[1:30:23] all of just 40 days
[1:30:26] bring them out of egypt
[1:30:28] get them through the promise i mean
[1:30:29] through the wilderness
[1:30:31] you say why didn't god send them
[1:30:33] straight from egypt into the promised
[1:30:35] land very simple
[1:30:39] god wanted to shape these people
[1:30:42] wanted to form them
[1:30:44] to to change them from these the people
[1:30:47] who had been in slavery for 430
[1:30:51] years
[1:30:52] different generations of them
[1:30:56] they were used to the ways of egypt
[1:30:57] egypt was a land where there was a lot
[1:30:59] of adultery a lot of gods they had
[1:31:01] different gods for different things
[1:31:03] they had god for this god for keeping
[1:31:05] you in the morning god forgive me
[1:31:06] nothing and god created the night
[1:31:07] different gods
[1:31:09] which is why when god gave them the ten
[1:31:11] commandments he said thou shalt have no
[1:31:13] other gods before me and then he said i
[1:31:17] am the lord
[1:31:18] thou shalt worship me alone
[1:31:20] because if he didn't say that
[1:31:23] these people were used to having so many
[1:31:24] gods
[1:31:25] this god the moses was talking about
[1:31:27] there the fathers i told them about who
[1:31:30] had brought them out of egypt would just
[1:31:31] have been added to one of these there
[1:31:33] are so many gods but god said that thou
[1:31:35] shalt have no other gods before me i'm
[1:31:38] the only one god
[1:31:40] so these are people who had been in
[1:31:42] egypt for
[1:31:43] 430 years
[1:31:46] and so
[1:31:48] because of god's laws of nature it's not
[1:31:50] possible for them to just overnight
[1:31:52] become people worthy of the
[1:31:55] of the promised
[1:31:56] land they won't even have what it takes
[1:32:00] to
[1:32:01] live in the promised land so god brought
[1:32:03] them out
[1:32:05] and had a design
[1:32:07] for a short period of time
[1:32:09] to nourish them in the wilderness to
[1:32:12] feed them in the wilderness to prepare
[1:32:14] them in the wilderness and to keep their
[1:32:16] promise of the promised land ahead of
[1:32:18] them and in 40 days they will get to the
[1:32:20] promised land
[1:32:22] that was the plan but god knew that the
[1:32:25] environment the desert environment the
[1:32:28] seemingly harsh environment of the
[1:32:30] wilderness was what was needed
[1:32:33] to shape their character to shape their
[1:32:36] internal personal
[1:32:38] personalities to make them into what god
[1:32:41] wants them to be people who are worthy
[1:32:43] to receive the promise
[1:32:47] but israel
[1:32:49] are a totally different plan totally
[1:32:52] different idea
[1:32:54] as soon as it came out
[1:32:57] a work of faith faith
[1:32:59] like abraham
[1:33:00] it looks like the promise is not coming
[1:33:02] to pass you know god is walking on me
[1:33:05] god's walking on me
[1:33:06] here they came out they had been called
[1:33:08] out
[1:33:09] next stage been nourished tutored child
[1:33:12] trained for behavior for character
[1:33:17] and israel felt different as long as
[1:33:19] they came out every small problem
[1:33:23] they complained
[1:33:24] every small problem they complained
[1:33:28] those was
[1:33:29] the challenge that god put on their path
[1:33:32] god said take them by this way
[1:33:35] and they met the red sea
[1:33:37] have you ever thought
[1:33:39] they were going back to the same
[1:33:41] mountain where moses saw the pill of
[1:33:43] fire and god sent him to egypt
[1:33:46] but moses didn't come to egypt by way of
[1:33:48] the red sea but god said take them by
[1:33:51] the way of the red sea i'm sure there
[1:33:53] were many in there fella moyes doesn't
[1:33:55] know the road give him gps to let him
[1:33:57] see like which is the better route there
[1:33:59] are no tours on the road there are no
[1:34:01] obstructions there are no rivers
[1:34:03] but god said take them by this way
[1:34:05] and instead of just believing their
[1:34:07] leader
[1:34:09] they chose not to
[1:34:11] so just believing the messenger sent to
[1:34:13] them
[1:34:14] not just anybody claiming to be a
[1:34:16] messenger
[1:34:17] a thoroughly properly vindicated
[1:34:20] messenger
[1:34:21] one man
[1:34:23] with the power of god who took on a
[1:34:25] whole egyptian army
[1:34:28] and totally
[1:34:30] overcame them by the power of god with a
[1:34:32] crooked stick in his hand
[1:34:34] they saw all that
[1:34:36] yet this will have you or does that the
[1:34:38] gumption they have the nerve
[1:34:40] to even challenge this prophet at all
[1:34:49] the most every single time god said ten
[1:34:53] times ten times
[1:34:55] ten times
[1:34:57] in the first few weeks of coming out of
[1:34:59] egypt
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:02] so god said i'm fed up with these people
[1:35:04] here
[1:35:05] and that's why the wood night journey
[1:35:07] became 440
[1:35:09] 40 40 40 years the wooden engine was
[1:35:11] supposed to be just 40 days
[1:35:13] to shape them more their character and
[1:35:15] all that
[1:35:16] and then they'll be ready for the
[1:35:17] promised land
[1:35:19] and what was it
[1:35:20] while they were shaping their i mean
[1:35:22] while it was nourishing them god moses
[1:35:25] sent spies into the promised land to
[1:35:26] bring the evidence what was that for to
[1:35:28] make them scared no to let them see the
[1:35:30] promise god gave them is really there
[1:35:34] but once they saw it
[1:35:36] they said no you have come to kill us
[1:35:38] here the anakims and all that the giants
[1:35:41] are there isn't that there are no graves
[1:35:42] in egypt and all of that stuff what god
[1:35:45] sent to help them to help their faith
[1:35:47] build their faith
[1:35:50] that's the very thing that they
[1:35:53] they feel faith faulted on
[1:35:56] and was at that point god said like that
[1:35:58] no i had it with these people here they
[1:35:59] are not going to go in the promised land
[1:36:01] only joshua caleb the two
[1:36:03] who believe me they are the only ones
[1:36:05] going to go
[1:36:06] and so you want to see a pattern here
[1:36:09] israel came out of egypt
[1:36:12] two million strong
[1:36:14] a church out of the world
[1:36:16] now god was calling a church out of a
[1:36:19] church was calling israel i was calling
[1:36:23] uh a
[1:36:23] uh uh joshua and kale left out of this
[1:36:25] church here and god said none of this
[1:36:28] prophet is gonna go in the promised land
[1:36:30] none of them
[1:36:31] i'm going to take
[1:36:34] a church out of a church
[1:36:36] i'm gonna take make a church out of
[1:36:39] out of out of moses i'm out of out of
[1:36:42] joshua and caleb
[1:36:44] and the new generation
[1:36:46] the their young children
[1:36:51] to take from his land
[1:36:54] so we see two patterns here a church
[1:36:57] out of a church
[1:36:59] a church out of the world number one and
[1:37:00] then a church out of a church and we see
[1:37:02] this pattern
[1:37:04] displayed throughout the seven church
[1:37:06] ages
[1:37:07] throughout the seven church ages
[1:37:10] so this was a state that israel was in
[1:37:13] going through the wilderness
[1:37:15] the 40 years was of their own making
[1:37:18] that wasn't god's making
[1:37:19] it was their own making because they
[1:37:21] refused to see that the wilderness was
[1:37:24] not the destination
[1:37:26] the promised land is the destination but
[1:37:29] as a journey through the wilderness and
[1:37:31] god knows the way through the wilderness
[1:37:33] and the wilderness has their purpose
[1:37:35] so
[1:37:36] israel missed the purpose of the
[1:37:38] wilderness
[1:37:41] and because the mesopotamians they ended
[1:37:44] up dying in the wilderness
[1:37:49] same way same way
[1:37:51] the wilderness represents the seven
[1:37:54] church edges
[1:37:56] the journey of the church from its birth
[1:37:58] on the day of pentecost through seven
[1:38:01] church ages
[1:38:03] that's what the ordinance represents to
[1:38:05] you and i in the new testament today
[1:38:09] and exactly what israel did the church
[1:38:11] has done
[1:38:13] israel fought and disbelieved the
[1:38:15] messenger
[1:38:17] the church ages disbelieved every single
[1:38:20] messenger that god sent to them
[1:38:22] as a matter of fact they killed them
[1:38:26] they murdered them murdered their
[1:38:28] character mother them physically
[1:38:32] just anything to make sure their message
[1:38:36] is not
[1:38:37] received and believed
[1:38:40] just exactly what israel did
[1:38:43] exactly what israel used to to the
[1:38:45] wilderness and so because of that the
[1:38:47] church has gone around and around and
[1:38:50] around in a death match like israel did
[1:38:55] like brother bob said the rapture would
[1:38:56] have long since gone
[1:38:59] but because of the church's unbelief who
[1:39:01] will not receive the messenger
[1:39:04] down through the age that god sent to
[1:39:05] each of the church ages
[1:39:12] so god
[1:39:13] he had israel out of egypt
[1:39:16] and then he had joshua and caleb out of
[1:39:18] that church
[1:39:19] same way
[1:39:21] he had
[1:39:24] paul
[1:39:25] the disciples out of the jewish church
[1:39:29] to form the call of the
[1:39:31] efficient church
[1:39:34] and all the way down like that in the
[1:39:36] churches was
[1:39:37] the messenger came to ephesus they
[1:39:39] didn't receive him
[1:39:40] god took the little group that believed
[1:39:42] him took them out of that church
[1:39:45] a church out of a church and that's how
[1:39:48] god was able to carry his seat on until
[1:39:51] he's come to this end time here just
[1:39:53] like it came to
[1:39:54] in israel came right down to just two
[1:39:57] people who came out of egypt two
[1:40:00] that from the core of that church that
[1:40:02] was on the verge of the promised land
[1:40:05] now
[1:40:06] that was gonna go in the promised land
[1:40:08] so same way
[1:40:10] seven church ages
[1:40:12] seven church ages the church has been
[1:40:15] anything but obedient to the word of god
[1:40:18] and that's why
[1:40:20] no clarity like israel there was a plan
[1:40:23] to go to the promised land
[1:40:25] this wasn't a plan-less journey it
[1:40:27] wasn't a journey with no direction
[1:40:29] no god had his servant there moses the
[1:40:33] prophet moses
[1:40:37] who let at the pathway
[1:40:39] for them according to the word of the
[1:40:41] lord
[1:40:42] but israel will have none of it they had
[1:40:44] a better way to look at it
[1:40:47] and so
[1:40:50] want they end up in the wilderness
[1:40:52] because the really in their heart they
[1:40:54] came out but there were no desires of
[1:40:56] going into the promised land
[1:40:59] if you watch later when israel
[1:41:01] eventually go in the promised land
[1:41:03] these anakims that they were crying
[1:41:05] about go reading joshua
[1:41:07] how
[1:41:10] much of an easy work
[1:41:12] these giants they were crying about
[1:41:14] there was no contest
[1:41:17] when israel eventually faced them when
[1:41:19] israel went in the promised land by the
[1:41:21] word of joshua
[1:41:24] and that's what made them
[1:41:27] an enemy that was not even
[1:41:33] couldn't stand up to their god
[1:41:37] and that's what they did
[1:41:39] they lost it all because of that fair
[1:41:42] and that made them not to listen to the
[1:41:43] messenger and they want to end up in the
[1:41:45] wilderness
[1:41:46] what they're doing same thing in the
[1:41:47] church ages one is the messengers and of
[1:41:50] the wilderness everybody has his own way
[1:41:52] how to do the things till it becomes
[1:41:54] like no the church is no plan until it
[1:41:56] come right down to this day this end
[1:41:58] time here the church no plan no clarity
[1:42:00] on the things of god or nothing whether
[1:42:03] it's prosperity which you preach or
[1:42:05] whether it is like kingdom of heaven
[1:42:06] which you preach whether it is you know
[1:42:09] just everything whether it's signs and
[1:42:11] wonders healings they just don't know
[1:42:13] what to do and even it's it's filtered
[1:42:15] into the message
[1:42:18] people not quite clear what to do what
[1:42:20] to say because of not believing what the
[1:42:23] messenger said
[1:42:24] there's no ambiguity there's no nothing
[1:42:27] unclear about the message there's
[1:42:29] nothing unclear about what the messenger
[1:42:32] of this age has told us about how to go
[1:42:34] from from egypt right down straight into
[1:42:37] the promised land nothing can be
[1:42:38] crucified at all
[1:42:40] but when people have their own different
[1:42:42] idea from what the messenger said
[1:42:45] that's what happens that's why many
[1:42:47] people have what have been wiped out in
[1:42:48] the wilderness that's why they have died
[1:42:51] in the wilderness
[1:42:53] spiritually death
[1:42:55] i'm a spiritual death
[1:42:59] and that's what the bible says is in
[1:43:01] matthew 25.
[1:43:05] 10 wise 10 virgins want to meet the
[1:43:07] bridegroom
[1:43:09] talking about the coming of the lord
[1:43:11] talking about the seventh watch brother
[1:43:12] branham said
[1:43:14] five were wise five were foolish
[1:43:17] and while they waited for the bridegroom
[1:43:20] they all slumbered and slept and he
[1:43:21] explained that to me that was through
[1:43:23] the seven church ages the slumbering and
[1:43:27] sleeping has
[1:43:29] different meanings two meanings at least
[1:43:31] slumbering
[1:43:35] when it comes to the things of god
[1:43:38] sleeping
[1:43:41] physically dying
[1:43:42] for the waiting for the resurrection
[1:43:44] they all slumber then slept and he said
[1:43:46] gonna in this age here
[1:43:49] and all this confusion in the ages just
[1:43:51] meet them slumbering and sleeping that's
[1:43:54] what happened in israel that's what
[1:43:55] happens in the wilderness slumbering and
[1:43:57] sleeping
[1:43:59] slumbering sleeping because they would
[1:44:02] not listen to the word of the messenger
[1:44:06] and because of that their faith had no
[1:44:09] anchor
[1:44:11] through that they showed and proved that
[1:44:12] they were not
[1:44:15] the seed of abraham
[1:44:17] because abram staggered not at the
[1:44:19] promise of god through unbelief
[1:44:22] abraham believed god and it was
[1:44:24] according to him for righteousness
[1:44:29] how much of that we have have we seen
[1:44:30] today
[1:44:31] too many people
[1:44:33] who claim to follow the message just
[1:44:36] hanging out
[1:44:37] queering the world of the messenger
[1:44:40] fighting the word of the messenger
[1:44:42] contracting the word of the messenger
[1:44:44] explaining away the word of the
[1:44:45] messenger trying to prove the messenger
[1:44:47] was wrong
[1:44:49] trying to prove like they tried to prove
[1:44:50] moyes was wrong
[1:44:52] any wonder they have slumbered and slept
[1:44:56] in the wilderness
[1:44:58] and you wonder they were never able to
[1:45:00] they are never able to go in the
[1:45:01] promised land any wonder of course
[1:45:04] there's no wonder about that
[1:45:06] little wonder about that because the
[1:45:08] partner is in the bible
[1:45:10] you don't believe the word your faith
[1:45:12] falters your faith weakens and when your
[1:45:15] faith weakens is only a question of time
[1:45:16] before you get taken out of the way
[1:45:20] and that's why it says that
[1:45:22] we shall reap
[1:45:24] if
[1:45:25] we faint not
[1:45:30] and even the prophet moses
[1:45:33] who had pleaded with them with god for
[1:45:36] this stubborn people so many times
[1:45:39] eventually got you that these people are
[1:45:40] stiff-necked people
[1:45:42] till he got mad and angry at them and
[1:45:45] himself got caught up
[1:45:47] in the attitude and behavior that would
[1:45:50] not make it into the promised land
[1:45:53] there was so much confusion so much
[1:45:57] directionlessness among
[1:45:59] the israel church
[1:46:02] and moses wasn't directionless but
[1:46:04] because he had jesus honored god god
[1:46:08] wasn't going to get him to go in the
[1:46:10] promised land that's why i said my
[1:46:11] summer movies is dead he's no longer
[1:46:13] here
[1:46:16] he provided direction people won't
[1:46:18] listen to it now joshua i want to take
[1:46:20] over
[1:46:21] and send them over into the second half
[1:46:23] of this journey to go into the promised
[1:46:25] land is a new group that is a new church
[1:46:28] we have got a new group a new church now
[1:46:30] we got now we are going over to the
[1:46:32] promised land
[1:46:33] same thing exactly in church ages
[1:46:36] a church called out from the world
[1:46:39] every age
[1:46:40] caller from the world but in every age
[1:46:42] also
[1:46:43] remnant listen to the messenger to the
[1:46:46] age like they listen to moses and that
[1:46:48] remnant is called out of that church
[1:46:53] to form the core of believers who
[1:46:54] believe that message and they form that
[1:46:57] real bright age
[1:46:58] i mean that church age and from that
[1:47:00] group god moves on to the next age and
[1:47:03] the next age before you know that they
[1:47:04] conquer and then a real small cop
[1:47:07] believes the messenger so god comes
[1:47:09] again to call a church from out of a
[1:47:11] church
[1:47:13] and right on the banks of the jordan
[1:47:15] river
[1:47:16] there was that church that church that
[1:47:18] had been called out of egypt
[1:47:20] that should have been called out of the
[1:47:22] church
[1:47:23] joshua and caleb and the new generation
[1:47:26] who are ready now to go into the
[1:47:27] promised land same way in the church
[1:47:29] ages
[1:47:31] right down to our age here this entire
[1:47:33] image here to where everybody has a say
[1:47:38] on how to go in everybody has a say on
[1:47:41] what christianity is supposed to be till
[1:47:43] there
[1:47:45] about 45 000
[1:47:48] research says
[1:47:49] about forty five thousand christian
[1:47:52] denominations
[1:47:53] in the world right now forty five
[1:47:55] thousand
[1:47:58] blah blah blah always talk about iba
[1:47:59] nahara and some
[1:48:01] denominations about forty 45 000 check
[1:48:04] it out
[1:48:06] and this has given
[1:48:08] critics of christianity
[1:48:10] ample reason to say like that
[1:48:12] christianity is not true the claims of
[1:48:14] claim is not true why they are so much
[1:48:16] confused why they are not in agreement
[1:48:18] if they all believe the same jesus
[1:48:22] because they will not believe the word
[1:48:24] of the messenger
[1:48:25] because they don't believe the word of
[1:48:26] the messenger that is sent in every age
[1:48:29] and they will not believe the word of
[1:48:30] the messenger is set in this edge
[1:48:32] there's no ambiguity anywhere
[1:48:34] because what is one here o israel the
[1:48:37] lord that god is one lord thou shalt
[1:48:39] love him with all thy soul heart man and
[1:48:41] strength
[1:48:43] one lord one word one lord one faith one
[1:48:46] baptism but because the people will not
[1:48:48] believe the word of the messenger
[1:48:50] you have this confusion
[1:48:52] until it comes to this end time age here
[1:48:56] is more confusion than ever before
[1:49:00] a day that's like a cloudy day
[1:49:03] nothing clear not that day no night
[1:49:07] confusion
[1:49:09] but in the midst of that confession
[1:49:11] haziness you can't see your way clearly
[1:49:12] what is this no clarity on anything
[1:49:16] called god
[1:49:18] they don't know that they should preach
[1:49:20] the gospel or preach prosperity or
[1:49:22] preach like miracles or preach the word
[1:49:25] or preach they don't have a clue whether
[1:49:28] they should make their tent in this
[1:49:29] world or whatever
[1:49:32] in the midst of all that
[1:49:34] because then i will send the light in
[1:49:36] the evening time
[1:49:39] it was in the midst of all that
[1:49:41] that the cry came out behold the bagram
[1:49:44] cometh
[1:49:46] go here to meet him
[1:49:50] brother brahm explained that
[1:49:53] matthew 25
[1:49:55] is a
[1:49:56] is a seven churches like already said
[1:49:59] and when the cry came out
[1:50:01] that's
[1:50:02] the seventh watch which is this edge
[1:50:04] here
[1:50:05] let me read you a quote
[1:50:07] where he said um
[1:50:13] just a minute
[1:50:27] um
[1:50:32] okay
[1:50:34] on the rapture
[1:50:36] december the 4th 1965
[1:50:40] talking about
[1:50:42] this end time here
[1:50:43] and his ministry the first thing comes
[1:50:45] when he starts descending from the
[1:50:47] heaven
[1:50:48] there's a shout what is it it's a
[1:50:50] message to get the people together
[1:50:52] a message goes forth first
[1:50:55] now
[1:50:56] lamp trimming time rise and trim your
[1:50:58] lamps
[1:51:00] what what was that
[1:51:01] the seventh watch not the sixth the
[1:51:04] seventh behold the brethren cometh rise
[1:51:06] and trim your lambs
[1:51:08] and they did some of them found they
[1:51:10] didn't even have any oil in the lamp
[1:51:12] but it's lamb trimming time what is lamp
[1:51:14] meantime it's malacca for time
[1:51:19] it's
[1:51:20] luke 17 time
[1:51:22] all this prophecy
[1:51:24] that it can perfectly set in order for
[1:51:26] this day in the scripture
[1:51:30] so just like joshua had his commission
[1:51:33] to take the people over out of confusion
[1:51:36] out of the wilderness into the land of
[1:51:38] rest
[1:51:39] in the land of corn and wine same way
[1:51:42] the last day joshua ministry william
[1:51:45] branham's
[1:51:47] was given a commission
[1:51:50] behold the pragmatist
[1:51:52] to prepare a bride
[1:51:54] for the lord jesus to go into this
[1:51:56] promised land
[1:52:00] and like joshua his commission is also
[1:52:03] threefold and we can learn from joshua
[1:52:06] what this prophet's ministry was all
[1:52:07] about
[1:52:08] what this message is all about so you'll
[1:52:11] know and not be worried and bothered
[1:52:13] about people backing out and sidewinding
[1:52:17] and different people all people young
[1:52:19] people all of that querying and all
[1:52:21] those those are not new things
[1:52:24] it's the type of the type has got to be
[1:52:27] perfectly in order
[1:52:30] for it to line up with scriptures
[1:52:33] query question
[1:52:35] disbelief
[1:52:37] doubt
[1:52:38] lie
[1:52:43] so
[1:52:47] here's where you're going to really
[1:52:48] understand
[1:52:50] what
[1:52:51] this message is all about i mean
[1:52:54] not as though you don't understand it
[1:52:55] just
[1:52:56] a way of talking to put a message
[1:52:58] together for you
[1:53:00] and i'm almost done really
[1:53:04] you can understand now how brother venom
[1:53:06] spend
[1:53:07] a major part of his early ministry and
[1:53:10] even towards the end preaching on the
[1:53:11] seven church ages the seven church ages
[1:53:14] in other words it was going all the way
[1:53:16] back to the wilderness years to show us
[1:53:18] about the wilderness years
[1:53:21] and then i'll show you from here that
[1:53:25] seven seals
[1:53:27] is the other message
[1:53:30] that you focus on to bring the people
[1:53:33] into the promised land
[1:53:43] so joshua
[1:53:44] on the virgin from his land
[1:53:46] he had the threefold commission
[1:53:49] take them over jordan
[1:53:51] into the new land number two
[1:53:56] subdue and possess the land
[1:53:59] number three
[1:54:00] divide the land for them
[1:54:03] so that they can
[1:54:04] come to their place of rest
[1:54:07] and be able to have an inheritance for
[1:54:09] themselves and for their children and
[1:54:11] their children's children
[1:54:12] and their generations after them
[1:54:14] that was the plan
[1:54:16] god's plan is never defeated
[1:54:19] it's only unbelief doesn't hinder god it
[1:54:21] only hinders the unbelief and all those
[1:54:22] people who did not believe who i'm
[1:54:24] believing they wiped out and died in the
[1:54:26] wilderness
[1:54:28] but they believe in bunch
[1:54:30] there they were on the verge of the
[1:54:32] promised land
[1:54:36] who did the unbelief hinder
[1:54:38] the unbeliever
[1:54:42] god's
[1:54:43] bride still matched on

[1:55:02] joshua chapter one was a very very
[1:55:04] peculiar scripture for him like it was
[1:55:06] something that was always coming to him
[1:55:08] and he gave a few example if you if you
[1:55:10] experience that he had
[1:55:12] in the early 50s up until like 57
[1:55:15] where
[1:55:17] his bible will open up to joshua warren
[1:55:19] and
[1:55:20] so he had it received his own joshua
[1:55:23] commission let me just review you can
[1:55:24] check it out many many quotes to that
[1:55:26] effect let me just read you one

[1:55:56] who had a vision and then after the
[1:55:57] vision the bible came to joshua one and
[1:56:01] that has constantly been before me
[1:56:04] before this time 53 after that he kept
[1:56:06] talking about that
[1:56:08] oh just i just can't get away from it

[1:56:52] joshua commission too because just like
[1:56:54] joshua here he was to take the people
[1:56:56] over by the holy spirit
[1:56:59] into the promised land
[1:57:04] another quote here
[1:57:06] are talking about that
[1:57:08] on adoption
[1:57:09] part 4
[1:57:10] uh 1960 may 22nd
[1:57:14] now
[1:57:18] what was the salvation he was trying to
[1:57:19] tell them
[1:57:21] but it is needed before the foundation
[1:57:22] of the earth is that right
[1:57:24] to the adoption of sons predator to
[1:57:26] eternal life now after you come into
[1:57:29] eternal life after you have been saved
[1:57:31] sanctified filled with the holy spirit
[1:57:34] your sons
[1:57:35] now god wanting to place you
[1:57:38] positionally
[1:57:39] also
[1:57:40] that you can work for his kingdom and
[1:57:43] his glory
[1:57:47] that's the gospel
[1:57:49] see first hear the word repent
[1:57:52] and be baptized name of jesus christ for
[1:57:54] the remission of sins taking away all
[1:57:56] your sins calling on the name of the
[1:57:57] lord jesus christ for the for for the
[1:58:00] promised land the promised unto every
[1:58:02] sajona that's on your own on your road
[1:58:04] if you left your home tonight a sinner
[1:58:06] saying i'll go over to the tabernacle
[1:58:09] god gives you the opponent tonight
[1:58:10] there's one thing left between you and
[1:58:12] the promised land what is promised land
[1:58:14] the holy ghost
[1:58:17] he's showing you
[1:58:19] his commission here
[1:58:21] while joshua was taking them to a
[1:58:22] physical line of rest
[1:58:24] his commission was to take
[1:58:26] this end-time bribe
[1:58:28] into the spiritual land of rest
[1:58:33] after the holy ghost baptism the land of
[1:58:35] adoption
[1:58:38] that's going to take us out of here in
[1:58:40] the rapture in the skies
[1:58:42] because you are not going out of here
[1:58:45] until you are adopted
[1:58:47] once you get to that land of rest god
[1:58:49] said is swore they will never enter into
[1:58:51] my arrest and this is the rest that
[1:58:54] brother venom is talking about here
[1:58:59] so
[1:59:02] only one thing listening on the promised
[1:59:04] land
[1:59:05] what is the promised land the holy ghost
[1:59:08] what led between joshua and the promised
[1:59:10] land was the jordan
[1:59:12] exactly right
[1:59:14] moses been a type of christ
[1:59:17] led the children up to the promised land
[1:59:21] then moses did not take the train into
[1:59:23] the promised land
[1:59:25] joshua took the people in and divided up
[1:59:29] the land
[1:59:30] jesus paid the price
[1:59:32] led them up to the holy spirit
[1:59:35] then god sent the holy spirit down and
[1:59:38] he personally put the church in order
[1:59:41] each man filling him with the prince of
[1:59:43] his being
[1:59:44] you see what i mean
[1:59:46] all in christ jesus how god participated
[1:59:48] this to the calling
[1:59:50] of this gospel
[1:59:54] so here we are
[1:59:57] we are ready to go over let's see what
[2:00:00] uh uh let's quickly uh uh uh um um look
[2:00:03] at each of these elements here crossing
[2:00:06] the jordan
[2:00:08] when we see how joshua across jordan
[2:00:10] then we'll know
[2:00:11] what it implies and what it means to you
[2:00:13] and i
[2:00:15] the jordan represented death we all know
[2:00:17] that
[2:00:18] and causing the jordan represented
[2:00:20] crossing from the all to the new
[2:00:22] crossing from the confusion of the
[2:00:24] church ages into the new land crossing
[2:00:27] from the commission of the wilderness
[2:00:29] into a land that's flown with milk and
[2:00:31] honey
[2:00:32] amen
[2:00:34] the jordan represented a death to the
[2:00:37] old and he breathed
[2:00:39] into the new
[2:00:42] notice now
[2:00:43] the only way they could cross the jordan
[2:00:46] was the act of the lord by the mouth of
[2:00:48] joshua the act of the lord but joshua
[2:00:51] gave the instruction on what to do with
[2:00:52] that act and once they
[2:00:55] are the priesthood into the water the
[2:00:57] jordan patent
[2:00:58] in other words they could only cross the
[2:01:01] jordan by the word of joshua
[2:01:04] same way here you can only come out of
[2:01:06] this mess by the water malachi 4. you
[2:01:09] can argue with what the prophet said and
[2:01:12] think that is what is going to get you
[2:01:14] anywhere and that's why people died
[2:01:18] in the wilderness
[2:01:20] even today
[2:01:26] so the word of the lord by joshua is
[2:01:29] what took them over
[2:01:30] into the promised land out of the old
[2:01:33] into the new
[2:01:35] into the land
[2:01:37] flowing with milk
[2:01:39] and honey
[2:01:41] glory to god
[2:01:43] what does this mean when you come into
[2:01:46] this world here
[2:01:47] by the water of malachi 4 you are coming
[2:01:50] from the denominations coming from
[2:01:53] pentecost coming from your own lifestyle
[2:01:54] coming from your own school and your old
[2:01:57] ways is a totally brand new world
[2:01:59] totally brand new life
[2:02:01] everything changes in malacca fall land
[2:02:05] in the new land of the holy ghost
[2:02:08] everything changes
[2:02:10] your outlook your perspectives your
[2:02:12] dressing your styles your values
[2:02:15] everything changes
[2:02:19] you can't carry them over no you can't
[2:02:21] go through the jordan like that
[2:02:25] everything changes
[2:02:26] because you have crossed from the old
[2:02:29] to the new that's what the jordan
[2:02:30] represents
[2:02:31] you have crossed from the confusion
[2:02:35] of pentacles
[2:02:36] the confession of the wilderness
[2:02:39] into the light of malachi first gospel
[2:02:42] the old corn of the land
[2:02:46] oh my hallelujah
[2:02:50] once into the promised land
[2:02:53] you are in the land of corn and wine you
[2:02:54] are in the land of the all kind of land
[2:02:55] notice when they came over into the
[2:02:57] promised land one of the first things
[2:02:59] that happened was as soon as they came
[2:03:00] in there
[2:03:01] the manner that they have enjoyed for 40
[2:03:04] years stopped ceased
[2:03:06] totally
[2:03:10] and they were to feast on old corn of
[2:03:15] the land
[2:03:16] in the new land they were the first on
[2:03:17] the oracle of the land
[2:03:20] in other words the mana
[2:03:22] just spoon feed you spoon-feed you
[2:03:26] for babies
[2:03:27] in the wilderness whining complaining
[2:03:29] babies in the wilderness
[2:03:32] once you come into the malacca fort
[2:03:34] territory
[2:03:36] once you come into the joshua territory
[2:03:39] the old
[2:03:40] manner ceased
[2:03:43] the manifest and you are now
[2:03:45] into the land of corn and wine
[2:03:47] the old corn of the land the mysteries
[2:03:50] of the kingdom of god the deep things of
[2:03:52] god the rich things of god we can take
[2:03:55] you and teach you real sorry things now
[2:03:58] not skim milk ideas like they want in
[2:04:01] pentecost and that's why people you know
[2:04:03] you know
[2:04:06] querying what brother bannon said on
[2:04:07] these and all that and things that young
[2:04:09] people don't even fault don't even pay
[2:04:11] attention to those things
[2:04:12] fathers mothers don't pay at any
[2:04:14] attention to any of those things or
[2:04:16] you'll end up in the wilderness
[2:04:18] or you'll come over into the
[2:04:20] even cross jordan and you are not able
[2:04:22] to go any further
[2:04:27] so in this land here
[2:04:30] is the old kind of the land
[2:04:33] is the deep things of god
[2:04:36] not scheming ideas
[2:04:38] there's a there's too wide a gap between
[2:04:41] this messenger and pentacles and we're
[2:04:43] not talking an arrogance or a manner no
[2:04:45] but the reality is that too many people
[2:04:47] in the message
[2:04:49] don't even understand what they're
[2:04:50] supposed to do what they're supposed to
[2:04:52] be like what the message is what the
[2:04:55] destination is
[2:04:57] and so that's why these dependent
[2:04:58] consciousness the one who signs and
[2:05:00] wonders
[2:05:01] as though there is no
[2:05:03] miracle in the house of god if you don't
[2:05:06] have a miracle taking place
[2:05:09] go back to the world
[2:05:12] in the bread of christ
[2:05:13] miracles take place every single service
[2:05:16] every single day
[2:05:19] but because the people
[2:05:20] are so sure it's not gonna happen
[2:05:23] so they chase all these you know uh uh
[2:05:25] uh uh um
[2:05:26] uh um
[2:05:29] and it's it's it's it's such a big deal
[2:05:32] in the message right now because people
[2:05:35] feel
[2:05:37] unless they have a miracle
[2:05:39] unless they have a prophet in their
[2:05:40] church unless they have seen their
[2:05:42] church you know they are not whatever
[2:05:44] because they feel challenged by
[2:05:45] pentecostals
[2:05:49] and all the babies other other baby
[2:05:51] stuff
[2:05:54] and the place above
[2:05:57] the real miracle
[2:05:59] which comes by the word of god
[2:06:02] what on top of what on top of what on
[2:06:04] top of what on top of a word
[2:06:06] the all corner of the land
[2:06:08] that's when you come into malacca
[2:06:11] fertility and then what will happen next
[2:06:14] number one cross the jordan number two
[2:06:17] begin to conquer the land and here is
[2:06:20] where you're going to understand about
[2:06:21] the seven seals
[2:06:25] you can cross the jordan you can come
[2:06:27] into malacca first message you can
[2:06:28] preach the deep mysteries but until you
[2:06:30] understand and receive the revelation of
[2:06:33] the seven seals
[2:06:35] direct commission you cannot overcome
[2:06:39] and subdue egypt i mean subdued
[2:06:42] and the joy inheritance the promised
[2:06:44] land
[2:06:46] and that's what happened
[2:06:48] joshua
[2:06:51] the holy spirit ministry in this end
[2:06:53] time here like joshua of all joshua
[2:06:56] opened up the seven seals
[2:06:59] and the seven thunders underneath the
[2:07:01] seventh seal
[2:07:03] same way joshua in this age here this
[2:07:06] day here
[2:07:08] direct commission seven seals
[2:07:11] and seven thunders underneath it
[2:07:16] because joshua chapter five
[2:07:19] right before
[2:07:20] [Music]
[2:07:22] joshua opened up the seven seals
[2:07:26] down come the angel
[2:07:28] of the lord
[2:07:31] he saw the captain of the lord's words
[2:07:33] with the sword drawing in his hand and
[2:07:35] joshua said who are you are you for
[2:07:36] foreign
[2:07:41] same way
[2:07:42] before the seven seals were opened
[2:07:45] by the joshua
[2:07:47] of this end time here the holy ghost
[2:07:50] through the mystery of his prophet the
[2:07:52] great larger prophet down come
[2:07:57] the coming of the lord's host in the
[2:07:59] form of seven angels
[2:08:02] on mount sunset
[2:08:06] you understand why the devil fights so
[2:08:08] hard about the cloud
[2:08:11] because that's the lord himself come
[2:08:13] down
[2:08:14] to give
[2:08:15] the commission to go open up the seals
[2:08:18] so that the wars of jericho can come
[2:08:20] down
[2:08:21] so that the
[2:08:22] children of god can take over
[2:08:25] jericho
[2:08:27] and right through straight to their
[2:08:28] inheritance
[2:08:32] joshua chapter 5
[2:08:34] down come the lord with the sword in his
[2:08:36] hand the sword in his hand
[2:08:40] in this end time here down come the lord
[2:08:42] in form of seven angels
[2:08:44] with a sword in his hand
[2:08:46] on sabino count sword in his hand
[2:08:49] what was that sword
[2:08:51] that saw was malacca for his adoption
[2:08:53] that saw was authority
[2:08:56] to take to take the seven seals and tear
[2:08:59] down every wall
[2:09:01] and give you your inheritance
[2:09:08] that sword
[2:09:11] was authority take you all the way back
[2:09:13] to eden where the sword appeared first
[2:09:17] you know in eden
[2:09:18] when adam sinned and lost his
[2:09:20] inheritance because you are going back
[2:09:21] to the same inheritance lord's
[2:09:23] inheritance and the caribbeans were
[2:09:26] protected the way of the tree of life
[2:09:28] and projects you have to allow with a
[2:09:30] flaming sword that turned every way
[2:09:34] the flaming saw the revelation of the
[2:09:36] world that adam had lost i've forgotten
[2:09:39] all these deep mysteries of god that
[2:09:41] adam just became uh amnesty about he had
[2:09:45] amnesia right away about them the sword
[2:09:49] saw to that
[2:09:50] god was covered with a revelation a
[2:09:52] flaming sword on the word of a living
[2:09:55] god the sword of the spirit which is the
[2:09:57] word of god
[2:10:01] and malakai was given that sword
[2:10:06] the same sword in the hand of
[2:10:08] the captain of the lord's host and if
[2:10:10] you watch
[2:10:11] when they went into jericho every man
[2:10:13] had a sword in his hand and they went
[2:10:15] straight
[2:10:17] destroying anything in their path
[2:10:20] every hebrew man had a sword in his hand
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:25] that same sword
[2:10:26] that was in eden
[2:10:28] that same sword was joshua that same
[2:10:30] sword was in the hand of every man that
[2:10:33] went through after the wars of jericho
[2:10:35] came down
[2:10:36] that same sword was with malachi for his
[2:10:38] hands
[2:10:39] and that same sword is in your hand
[2:10:41] today
[2:10:43] by revelation
[2:10:45] to chop your way past every unbelieving
[2:10:48] devil
[2:10:50] it's in your hand
[2:10:52] but take a strong hand of faith to
[2:10:54] really make that sword and drive it to
[2:10:57] the enemy's heart
[2:11:00] hallelujah
[2:11:06] after the lord came down
[2:11:09] what would happen then chapter six was
[2:11:11] the opening of the sales watch what
[2:11:12] happened
[2:11:15] he said go around the city
[2:11:17] go around the walls of jericho
[2:11:19] seven days
[2:11:21] and on each day
[2:11:23] go around just once
[2:11:25] days one to six
[2:11:28] one time run the wall
[2:11:30] on day seven
[2:11:32] go around the wall
[2:11:33] seven times
[2:11:35] seven times around the wall on day seven
[2:11:37] what is that
[2:11:39] same thing malachi 4 did
[2:11:42] march 1963
[2:11:43] open up the seals
[2:11:46] one seal per day
[2:11:48] for the first six days
[2:11:50] the seventh day
[2:11:52] seven seal opened
[2:11:55] covered with the silence
[2:11:57] said keep quiet
[2:11:59] don't say one word until ability to
[2:12:01] shout
[2:12:03] he placed the shout underneath the
[2:12:06] seventh day
[2:12:07] and they went around seven times
[2:12:10] what did brother ban i'm saying on the
[2:12:11] seven seals
[2:12:13] this seven seal mystery
[2:12:17] i have the revision revealed and it's
[2:12:19] those seven or non-thunders
[2:12:21] that was
[2:12:23] banging right straight close together
[2:12:25] isn't it three four mana but i'll tell
[2:12:26] you about one full of it and it's those
[2:12:28] seven thunders just exactly what joshua
[2:12:30] did
[2:12:32] put the seven thunders underneath the
[2:12:35] seventh seal
[2:12:36] to bring down the walls of jericho
[2:12:39] and put a sword in the hand of every
[2:12:41] hebrew man
[2:12:42] every hebrew believer to go right into
[2:12:45] jericho and take over
[2:12:48] now
[2:12:49] jericho's walls were not just the kind
[2:12:52] of wars you have in your house wherever
[2:12:53] you live in the world
[2:12:55] jericho's walls were about
[2:12:57] 20 feet wide
[2:13:00] 20 feet wide they said those walls were
[2:13:02] so big you could do
[2:13:04] a four-lane car race on those walls of
[2:13:07] jericho so they were very massive walls
[2:13:11] but the revelation of the seven seals
[2:13:13] and the seven thunders direct commission
[2:13:15] brought down every wall
[2:13:20] then
[2:13:21] and now if he did it then he's doing it
[2:13:24] right now
[2:13:25] the revelation
[2:13:26] of the seven seals and the seven
[2:13:29] thunders direct commission that's what
[2:13:32] gives us the authority to go and take
[2:13:35] over in the promised land so that we can
[2:13:37] have our inheritance again
[2:13:40] so you can have our inheritance and go
[2:13:42] into our rest that
[2:13:45] those people who will not believe moses
[2:13:49] died in the wilderness and could not
[2:13:51] come to this spot here
[2:13:52] so even if you come in the mess even if
[2:13:55] you cross over jordan even if you take
[2:13:57] the old con of the land
[2:13:59] and you don't receive malacca first
[2:14:01] message of the seven seals and the seven
[2:14:02] thunders
[2:14:04] you are not going to be able to bring
[2:14:06] down the wars of jericho
[2:14:08] because that's the strategy
[2:14:10] joshua knew to overcome and take over
[2:14:13] the promised land he went for the center
[2:14:15] of the promised land for us jericho
[2:14:18] he pulled it down by the seven thunders
[2:14:21] seven seven seven seals and the seven
[2:14:23] thunders malacca's message
[2:14:31] and watch
[2:14:33] once the words of jericho came down
[2:14:35] the seven seals
[2:14:38] that's direct commission
[2:14:40] the seven seals
[2:14:42] is revelation
[2:14:44] that's gonna take you all the way back
[2:14:47] to eden
[2:14:50] all the way back to the sword in your
[2:14:52] hand
[2:14:53] all the way back to spoken word power
[2:14:55] and authority
[2:14:57] all the way back to all that adam lost
[2:14:59] in the garden of eden the seven seals
[2:15:03] take you back to your rest
[2:15:06] oh hallelujah
[2:15:09] and then
[2:15:11] once they
[2:15:13] joshua opened up the seven seals
[2:15:16] and with the seven thunders underneath
[2:15:17] it
[2:15:18] was a jedi could come down and so will
[2:15:20] your walls come down
[2:15:22] your lifestyle lifestyle world will come
[2:15:25] down
[2:15:26] whatever wall you come down
[2:15:29] if you receive the message
[2:15:31] malacca first message of the seven seals
[2:15:34] you understand now what malacca for
[2:15:35] preaching seven seven church ages on the
[2:15:38] seven seals
[2:15:41] he was showing you something he was
[2:15:43] showing you how to go back to your
[2:15:45] inheritance showing you that by this
[2:15:47] revelation in the seven seals is what
[2:15:49] connects you right back to eden to where
[2:15:52] the sword is gonna be in your hand and
[2:15:54] you are gonna come to your rest you are
[2:15:55] gonna have your rest like adam had in
[2:15:57] the garden of eden
[2:15:59] you are gonna come right back to
[2:16:01] adoption time sons of god going back
[2:16:04] coming back to perfection coming back to
[2:16:06] authority coming back to rulership
[2:16:08] and watch how it happens watch high
[2:16:10] stats once they overcame jericho next
[2:16:14] place they went to was i
[2:16:16] the city of i i me myself i mean myself
[2:16:23] what is it
[2:16:25] the battle went straight to
[2:16:27] your personal life
[2:16:29] that's what it can represent your
[2:16:30] personal life the revelation of the
[2:16:33] seven seals malacca first message
[2:16:36] gotta touch your personal life
[2:16:42] she had done everything in your personal
[2:16:44] life that's unlike the spirit of a
[2:16:45] living god tie it down because we are
[2:16:48] taking over the land your land of your
[2:16:50] own body of your own flesh
[2:16:53] the wars of jericho have come down the
[2:16:55] seven seals brings them there's
[2:16:57] no spirit no authority nothing that can
[2:17:01] withstand the authority of the seven
[2:17:03] seals
[2:17:04] nothing nothing
[2:17:05] because that's the message
[2:17:07] right straight from the mind of god
[2:17:10] thus the seven spirits of god come right
[2:17:12] down in the form of a message what
[2:17:14] spirit can withstand it
[2:17:16] and it's been given to us
[2:17:19] and so israel
[2:17:21] with that
[2:17:22] they went over
[2:17:24] begin to attack i
[2:17:26] personal life so that the personal life
[2:17:29] of jesus christ can come into your life
[2:17:33] that's the rest
[2:17:36] and after i
[2:17:38] they went around everywhere in the land
[2:17:42] joshua attacked the center of the land
[2:17:44] first then he went to the southern
[2:17:46] kingdoms then went to the northern
[2:17:48] kingdoms what is it what does that mean
[2:17:50] malacca for his message his commission
[2:17:52] take you over take you over jordan
[2:17:54] number two conquer the land that's the
[2:17:56] conquering phase this lamb trimming time
[2:17:59] message cleaning you up
[2:18:02] getting every filthy thing out of your
[2:18:04] life
[2:18:06] trimming your lamps
[2:18:08] don't let your light be dreamed out with
[2:18:11] filthiness
[2:18:13] and suit
[2:18:14] rise and trim your lambs take the seals
[2:18:17] the message of malachi 4 and let it sow
[2:18:20] the satch fly into every nook and corner
[2:18:22] of your life sure we are predestinated
[2:18:24] but we got a job to do got to take the
[2:18:26] sword and chase every div every devil
[2:18:29] out chase every devil out in the center
[2:18:32] at the bottom the southern part the
[2:18:34] topmost part everywhere
[2:18:40] and that's what joshua did that's what
[2:18:42] joshua did that's what joshua did he had
[2:18:45] the army
[2:18:47] going round
[2:18:49] beginning with the wars of jericho
[2:18:50] coming down no matter the walls no
[2:18:52] matter how severe no matter how powerful
[2:18:53] no matter how thick
[2:18:56] bring it down
[2:19:00] and then go into your personal life i
[2:19:04] so that your personal life
[2:19:06] will get out of the way and his personal
[2:19:08] life every single day will come into you
[2:19:12] day by day becoming more like jesus
[2:19:14] christ by taking the message the sword
[2:19:16] of the lord
[2:19:18] which is the word of god
[2:19:21] by the spirit of god taking it and
[2:19:24] shining the light into your own life
[2:19:26] knowing to another person into your life
[2:19:30] so that the life of jesus christ can
[2:19:31] come into you day by day by day by day
[2:19:34] by day
[2:19:37] and then
[2:19:39] when joshua has done all of that
[2:19:43] has conquered
[2:19:45] jericho
[2:19:46] conquered eye
[2:19:48] conquer the southern kingdoms conquered
[2:19:50] the northern kingdoms
[2:19:52] there was still some land to be
[2:19:54] taken
[2:19:55] but by this time
[2:19:58] a lot of the a lot a lot of the
[2:20:01] a lot of the uh our promised land
[2:20:04] have been rid of its
[2:20:06] previous inhabitants
[2:20:08] your previous inhabitants in your land
[2:20:12] there are still a little remaining but
[2:20:15] the major part of the job had been done
[2:20:18] and so god told joshua chapter 13 you
[2:20:20] are getting all joshua
[2:20:22] there's still some land much land to be
[2:20:24] recovered so what we're going to do is
[2:20:25] this here
[2:20:26] but this time
[2:20:27] here the land had been rid of many of
[2:20:30] the enemies
[2:20:32] what happened was that joshua now got to
[2:20:35] the last part of his commission to
[2:20:37] divide the land to the people to the
[2:20:40] tribes
[2:20:41] and that's where your individual
[2:20:43] inheritance comes in because each tribe
[2:20:45] is made up of individuals
[2:20:49] so when joshua at this point here by
[2:20:51] this time there have been about seven
[2:20:53] years in the promised land
[2:20:56] and most of the land
[2:20:58] have been reclaimed
[2:21:00] but that still remain
[2:21:01] some remnant to be reclaimed and so
[2:21:03] joshua dismantled
[2:21:05] the army
[2:21:07] and now
[2:21:08] gave
[2:21:09] each tribe apart from the levites
[2:21:11] their own portion of inheritance
[2:21:17] for them to now go and take care of
[2:21:19] themselves
[2:21:21] and clean up
[2:21:23] the land of every
[2:21:26] inhabitant
[2:21:29] and that's where
[2:21:31] the individual inheritance comes that's
[2:21:32] why in chapter 14 that's why caleb came
[2:21:35] to me now therefore give me this
[2:21:36] mountain man hebron
[2:21:38] i know the anakims are there the
[2:21:40] the the the three sons of uh are are are
[2:21:44] they i'll i will take them out if the
[2:21:46] lord be with me i will take them out
[2:21:49] and what does that represent
[2:21:52] the dynamics
[2:21:55] to your mechanics
[2:21:57] because right now with the sword of the
[2:22:00] lord in your hand the revelation of the
[2:22:02] world
[2:22:03] you are chopping your way through and
[2:22:05] cleaning your life of every enemy
[2:22:11] but they're not all gone yet
[2:22:14] and that's where
[2:22:16] you get to the point of individual
[2:22:19] inherent possessing your individual
[2:22:21] inheritance in the promised land
[2:22:23] to ask for your own influence like caleb
[2:22:26] asked for his and that's when
[2:22:28] god sends you the dynamics
[2:22:31] upon your mechanics
[2:22:33] and what dynamics do the spirit of the
[2:22:35] living god
[2:22:39] after you have been
[2:22:41] justified sanctified baptized the holy
[2:22:44] ghost the holy spirit comes down on you
[2:22:47] to begin to add the spirit of living god
[2:22:50] to you
[2:22:51] by a manifestation of his own spirit
[2:22:54] himself
[2:22:58] and
[2:22:59] by an experience
[2:23:01] you are becoming more and more and more
[2:23:04] like just not by revelation now by an
[2:23:06] experience because the dynamic is here
[2:23:08] now
[2:23:10] and when god can see that
[2:23:13] he takes you aside
[2:23:16] calls you aside and visit with an angel
[2:23:20] and add three more words to you
[2:23:22] and you come into the rest of the lord
[2:23:26] you come into his rest
[2:23:28] adoption time
[2:23:30] and when you're adopted
[2:23:32] that's when you are ready to go in the
[2:23:34] rapture in the skies
[2:23:37] you have come to your rest
[2:23:39] a spiritual rest
[2:23:41] you are now going to a land of a
[2:23:44] physical arrest on the which is on the
[2:23:46] other side of the
[2:23:48] resurrection
[2:23:50] you are going the rapture
[2:23:52] in the skies to land on the other side
[2:23:55] of the resurrection
[2:23:58] so what are you senior preacher
[2:24:00] as i'm fixing the clothes
[2:24:02] what i'm saying here is that
[2:24:04] you have been called out by malaka for
[2:24:07] his message
[2:24:08] you have been called out from egypt you
[2:24:09] have been called out
[2:24:12] through the jordan you have been called
[2:24:14] up from the denominations heavy
[2:24:16] high-minded lovers of pleasure
[2:24:17] i've been called out of all
[2:24:19] of that
[2:24:20] and here you are
[2:24:22] now on the other side of jordan
[2:24:25] after called out what's next
[2:24:28] you are nourished you are tutored you
[2:24:30] are child trained for behavior
[2:24:34] the sword is put in your hands
[2:24:37] by the revelation of the seven seals and
[2:24:39] the seven thunders
[2:24:41] put in your hands
[2:24:42] to rise and trim your lamps
[2:24:45] and clean your land of every filthiness
[2:24:49] clean your land of everything on like
[2:24:51] jesus christ
[2:24:54] and when god can see you do that
[2:24:56] he sends the dynamics upon you
[2:24:59] to give you the energy the help you need
[2:25:02] to finish the job so yeah composes your
[2:25:05] individual inheritance in the promised
[2:25:06] land your individual inheritance is your
[2:25:09] adoption time
[2:25:10] to be to have your own hebron experience
[2:25:14] to where you clear every spirit out of
[2:25:16] your land by this
[2:25:18] authority and the spirit of the living
[2:25:20] god
[2:25:21] that's where we are friends that's what
[2:25:23] we're waiting on
[2:25:24] that's what the messenger has been about
[2:25:27] i don't focus on a bunch of sidewinders
[2:25:30] who have known they had to go in the
[2:25:32] promised land but you know for yourself
[2:25:35] when you know you are caller you know

[2:25:40] life and you are predestinated in the
