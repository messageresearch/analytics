[16:35] May we stand this evening special way.
[16:39] And yes, I'll praise
[16:42] you. I'll lift you up and I'll magnify
[16:47] your
[16:50] name. That's why my heart is filled with
[16:55] praise. Can every hand raise? Let's just
[16:57] say, "Oh, I love
[17:00] you. I love you.
[17:03] I love you, Lord,
[17:07] today because you cared for
[17:11] me in such a special way. And yes, I'll
[17:17] praise
[17:18] you. I'll lift you up and I'll magnify
[17:23] your name.
[17:27] That's why my heart is filled with
[17:32] praise. Oh, sing my
[17:36] heart. My
[17:38] mind, my soul belongs to
[17:42] you. You paid a price for
[17:47] me way back on
[17:50] Calary. And yes, I praise you. I lift
[17:56] you up and I'll magnify your
[18:01] name. That's why my heart is filled with
[18:06] praise. Just one more time. More
[18:09] singing. I love
[18:12] you. I love
[18:14] you. I love you, Lord.
[18:18] today because you cared for
[18:23] me in such a special way. And yes, I'll
[18:28] praise you. I'll lift you up and I'll
[18:33] magnify your
[18:37] name. That's why my heart is filled with
[18:42] praise.
[18:48] Blessed be the name of the
[18:51] Lord. Thank you,
[18:53] Jesus. Thank you, lamb of
[18:55] God. Thank you, Father. We're glad to be
[18:59] here this
[19:00] evening. Blessed be the name of the
[19:02] Lord. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[19:04] praise.
[19:06] Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, I'd
[19:09] like you to quickly turn with me to book
[19:12] to the book of Psalms. Let's reading
[19:14] chapter
[19:16] 108. Just a couple verses
[19:21] there. Psalms
[19:23] [Music]
[19:26] 108. And it says, "Oh God, my heart is
[19:30] fixed. I will sing and give praise even
[19:34] with my glory. Awake sulttery and harp.
[19:38] I myself will awake early. I will praise
[19:41] thee, oh Lord, among the people, and I
[19:43] will sing praises unto thee among the
[19:46] nations. For thy mercy is great above
[19:48] the heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto
[19:51] the clouds. Be thou exalted, oh God,
[19:54] above the heavens, and thy glory above
[19:57] all the
[19:59] earth. May the Lord add a blessing to
[20:01] the reading of his word. And we bow our
[20:04] heads a word of prayer.
[20:06] Oh heavenly father, this evening we deem
[20:09] it such a privilege to gather together
[20:11] in your name Lord to gather together in
[20:14] your house in your presence Lord. Lord
[20:17] where there's fullness of joy Lord Lord
[20:19] where we could have freedom and liberty
[20:21] to praise and worship you Lord and exalt
[20:23] your holy name Lord. Father we pray
[20:26] tonight that you would pour out a
[20:27] blessing upon us Lord. Lord, that you
[20:30] will raise us up, that you'll quicken
[20:32] our hearts, Lord, that you'll inspire
[20:34] us, Lord. Lord, that you would take full
[20:37] control over this entire service, Lord.
[20:39] Every song that is sung and every word
[20:40] that is spoken, Lord. Lord, we thank you
[20:43] for the musicians, the singers, the
[20:45] worshippers, Lord, everyone gathered
[20:47] here tonight, Lord. I pray that you have
[20:49] your perfect will. Have your
[20:50] preeminence, Lord. Lord, be with those
[20:53] that were unable to make it in person,
[20:55] Lord. Lord, those connected on the
[20:57] internet, those that may see it
[20:59] afterwards, those with special needs
[21:01] tonight, those that may have a special
[21:03] burden, Lord, a special desire on their
[21:05] heart, Lord. Lord, I pray that you reach
[21:08] and you touch them and and would do a
[21:11] special work among them tonight in Jesus
[21:13] name we pray.
[21:15] Amen. Blessed be his holy
[21:18] name. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Let's sing

[24:46] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[24:50] Hallelujah. You love him tonight. Amen.
[24:53] We're in for our time. I've come under
[24:56] expectation for the miraculous to take
[24:58] place. Amen. Do you feel that way? Let's
[25:02] sing that song. Thank you Lord for
[25:03] saving my
[25:05] soul. Thank you Lord. Every hand raise
[25:10] for saving my
[25:15] soul.

[26:36] the words tonight. Thank you,
[26:41] Lord, for making me whole.
[26:49] Thank you
[26:51] Lord for giving to
[26:57] me thy great

[27:06] free. I want to
[27:09] live the
[27:11] way Jesus wants
[27:14] me to live. I want to
[27:20] give until there's just no more to
[27:26] give. I want to
[27:30] love love till there's just no more
[27:36] love. See, I could
[27:39] never never out love the Lord. Let's
[27:44] just sing it one more time.

[29:01] so thankful and grateful for your loving
[29:04] kindness and your tender mercies that
[29:06] you've shown towards us. for bringing us
[29:08] today, for keeping us
[29:10] [Music]
[29:20] alive. So
[29:22] give I want no
[29:25] love, love till
[29:28] there's just no more love.
[29:33] I can
[29:35] never really out love the Lord. Let's
[29:39] just sing it one more
[29:41] time. Oh, I want to
[29:45] live the
[29:47] way Jesus wants
[29:49] me to live. I want to
[29:55] give until there's just no more to give.
[30:02] I want to
[30:04] love love till there's just no more
[30:11] love. I can
[30:14] never never out love the
[30:20] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[30:23] Lord. Thank you
[30:26] Jesus. Thank you lamb of God.
[30:32] Amen. At this time, I want to switch
[30:35] over to the good portion of the service.
[30:39] Amen.
[30:41] You love the Lord tonight. Isn't he
[30:46] wonderful. My my
[30:48] my what a awesome God we serve. What a
[30:52] mighty God we serve.
[30:55] What
[30:56] a a powerful God we
[30:59] serve. There's nobody that could compare
[31:02] to
[31:04] him.
[31:06] Amen. Let's just bow our heads as
[31:11] we would have a word of prayer. Oh,
[31:14] heavenly father, Lord, we we so
[31:16] thankful. We so grateful, Lord. We don't
[31:18] want to for a second underestimate and
[31:21] undervalue this opportunity that we
[31:23] have, Lord. Lord, we want to hold on to
[31:25] it like it's our last. Lord, we want it
[31:27] to be meaningful, Lord. Lord, we didn't
[31:29] come here just to see each other or to
[31:31] waste time, Lord. Lord, we came to cause
[31:33] something to happen and to to be a part
[31:35] of something that's taking place,
[31:37] present tense, Lord. Lord, we know
[31:39] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[31:40] forever. And we also know you left some
[31:42] promises for your bride in the end time,
[31:44] Lord, that we want to pick up in this
[31:46] hour, Lord. Lord, I pray that you will
[31:49] anoint me, that you would speak lip to
[31:51] air to your people, that you'll take me
[31:53] out of the way, Lord. Lord, I may not be
[31:54] much of a preacher, but I believe I have
[31:56] a message for your people tonight. And I
[31:58] pray that it'll find good ground in
[32:00] their hearts, Lord. Lord, we pray that
[32:02] our minds would be open, our our
[32:04] understanding would be open, that our
[32:06] that our hearts would be blessed, that
[32:08] by the time we leave this place, Lord,
[32:10] we should be energized and inspired and
[32:12] and uplifted and restored and and lives
[32:15] will be changed. that no one would have
[32:17] left this place the same way they came,
[32:18] Lord. Lord, we know that you're powerful
[32:21] and you're awesome and your your word is
[32:23] vindicated and your you sent a prophets
[32:26] in this end time to bring a special
[32:27] message for us, Lord. Lord, and at this
[32:30] time, Lord, we thank you for the songs,
[32:32] the music, the singing, Lord, in the
[32:34] atmosphere that we feel, Lord. And we
[32:36] believe that your Holy Spirit could drop
[32:38] down even now once more among your
[32:41] people, Lord, that you could revive us
[32:43] again, Lord. Once more, we've come under
[32:46] expectation to hear from you. Not just
[32:48] to hear fables and and and words and
[32:51] stories, Lord, but to hear what you have
[32:53] in store for us tonight, Lord. Lord, I
[32:55] pray that you will be with us as we
[32:57] fellowship around your word. In Jesus
[32:59] name we pray. Amen. Amen. You love the
[33:03] Lord. Amen.
[33:07] You may have your seats.
[33:11] He's so wonderful. Amen.
[33:16] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, brother
[33:19] Steven. Let's go straight to the word
[33:21] tonight.
[33:24] And from a message Jehovah Gyra,
[33:28] um, brother Brandham shared, you could
[33:30] have your seats. A little echo on the
[33:32] platform in the message Jehovah Gyra 61
[33:36] paragraph 18. He says how he could tell
[33:38] a pig that he was wrong by eating slop.
[33:42] That's the nature of the pig. That's
[33:43] what a pig does. That's what he's
[33:45] accustomed doing. He says, "See, he's a
[33:48] pig to begin with. That's his
[33:51] nature. That's what you was a sinner."
[33:55] That's describing you. You know, he
[33:57] can't blame you for being you. That's
[33:59] your nature. Your nature is a sinner.
[34:02] Amen. But he said alienated, cut off
[34:06] from God. You How could you tell a
[34:08] leopard his spots wasn't right? That's
[34:10] what a leopard is. That's what a leopard
[34:12] does. A leopard has spots. See, how
[34:15] could he lick them and try to wash them
[34:17] off? The leopard can't try to be a lion.
[34:20] The leopard can't try to be a zebra. A
[34:22] leopard is a leopard. Amen. You say,
[34:24] "How could he wash them off?" He just
[34:25] makes them brighter. That's the way you
[34:28] try to do to take religion to polish
[34:30] yourself up to make a better creature a
[34:32] creature out of you. You got to realize
[34:35] that you are dead. You're no good at
[34:37] all. You see, if we could just accept
[34:38] that service over, you're no good. You
[34:42] can't do anything without God. You can't
[34:44] achieve anything. You can't go anywhere.
[34:47] You can't achieve a goal or some
[34:49] objective without his guidance, without
[34:52] his support, without his backing. Amen.
[34:55] He say you're no good at all. You're
[34:57] filthy. And God's the only one can help
[35:01] you. That's right. When you do that,
[35:03] then you're getting close to the kingdom
[35:04] of God when you reckon yourself nothing.
[35:08] So when you forget about being
[35:10] pretentious and who who people say you
[35:12] are and who you think you are and you
[35:14] leave that alone, he said, "Listen, when
[35:17] you reckon yourself nothing and just
[35:18] solemnly depend on him and let the Holy
[35:21] Spirit lead you, is that what you want
[35:23] tonight?" That I think the church has
[35:26] been preached to death. The thing it
[35:28] needs now is to come back to teaching
[35:30] and getting on the foundation so you'll
[35:33] know how to build yourself up in Christ.
[35:35] And we've built our churches upon
[35:37] sensations and upon different things,
[35:39] but can't build nothing but Christ. It
[35:42] must be built upon the revelation of
[35:44] Jesus Christ. Amen. That's the only
[35:47] thing that we could do. In him, you are
[35:50] complete. And with it, without him,
[35:52] you're lost. There's not a way in the
[35:54] world for you to be saved. So that in
[35:57] short reiterated or highlighted or
[36:00] underscored the point that without him,
[36:02] we're nothing. Without him, we could
[36:04] achieve nothing. Without him, we go
[36:07] nowhere. Without him, you're lost.
[36:09] Without him, there's nothing you could
[36:11] do. You're no good. You're filthy
[36:14] because that's your nature without him.
[36:17] But tonight, we want to speak about my
[36:19] leader and my guide. The leader I have
[36:22] and the guide I have, the leader you
[36:24] should have and the guide you should
[36:26] have is the Holy Spirit. Is the word. is
[36:29] Jesus Christ himself taking you. Not you
[36:33] carrying yourself, but he's showing you
[36:35] where to go. He pulling you where he
[36:38] wants you to go. Amen.
[36:40] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:44] Blessed be his name. So for a title, my
[36:47] leader and my guide.
[36:53] Amen. And for for an inspiration, I'm
[36:56] lost without you. Amen. That's the
[36:58] reality. No matter what, without the
[37:02] right leader and the right guide, you're
[37:05] lost. You'll be miserable. You will just
[37:08] be spinning top in mud like the pig.
[37:11] You're just wallowing in mud, achieving
[37:14] nothing, doing nothing. Time just
[37:16] passing, and you're not growing, you're
[37:18] not maturing, you're not building,
[37:21] you're not adding. So your faith just
[37:24] stay just stay at the lowest level it
[37:27] could be when God wants you to add every
[37:29] virtue line upon line precept upon
[37:33] precept and that can't happen if you
[37:35] don't have the right guide the right
[37:38] leadership the right guide is important
[37:40] and you'll hear me use those two words
[37:42] almost interchangeably but it doesn't
[37:45] mean the same thing.
[37:48] Yeah. Before I go ahead, let's just
[37:51] stand and and read the
[37:53] scriptures. If you have your Bibles and
[37:55] you could turn with me to the book of
[37:57] John, St. John 16, just one verse there,
[38:01] verse 13. And you could
[38:03] probably find Romans 8:14 as
[38:07] well. Book of John chapter
[38:12] 16 and verse 13.
[38:20] Amen. And it says, "How be it, when he,
[38:24] the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
[38:28] guide you into all truth, for he shall
[38:31] not speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[38:35] shall hear, that shall he speak, and he
[38:39] will show you things to come." And in
[38:42] the book of Romans chapter 8 in verse
[38:47] 14, very familiar
[38:49] scripture and it says, "For as many as
[38:53] are led by the spirit of God, they are
[38:57] the sons of God." May the Lord add a
[39:00] blessing to the reading of his word.
[39:01] Amen. You may have your seats again.
[39:06] Now many
[39:09] times we would hear and we would observe
[39:11] and we would see that people in general
[39:13] they want to lead. They like to lead.
[39:16] People like to be in charge. They like
[39:19] to show that they are in
[39:22] control. They like to show that they
[39:24] could get it
[39:25] done right. And often times we expect
[39:28] that of
[39:29] leadership. But who is willing to be
[39:33] led? Amen.
[39:36] Often times we find people have a
[39:39] unwillingness to be led.
[39:43] On the other hand, you have to have a
[39:46] guide when you don't know where where
[39:49] you're going. Anytime there's
[39:51] uncertainty in your destination, you
[39:54] need a guide. You need somebody to show
[39:56] you where you have to go.
[39:59] Guidance requires experience.
[40:03] I cannot guide you if I don't know. I
[40:06] cannot guide if I haven't been there. I
[40:10] cannot guide if I haven't done that.
[40:14] But to differentiate between the two,
[40:16] you'll hear me use leading and guiding
[40:18] because I said my leader and my guide.
[40:21] There's a fundamental difference between
[40:23] the two that I want to identify and
[40:26] we'll see it in scripture as well and in
[40:27] the message.
[40:30] To differentiate them, I'll talk about
[40:32] leading first. Leading involves going
[40:36] ahead and directing from the front. I
[40:40] can't lead you from the
[40:43] back. To lead, I have to take some risk.
[40:47] I have to sacrifice myself almost to
[40:50] lead. It involves sacrifice. It involves
[40:54] trust. It involves confidence because
[40:56] you have to trust and have confidence in
[41:00] leadership in order to follow them. If
[41:03] you have doubt, you're going nowhere.
[41:06] And the leaders can't lead. Amen.
[41:09] Guidance on the other hand is a little
[41:11] different. I will deal with that one in
[41:13] a second.
[41:15] But in a message the prophet preached
[41:18] called
[41:19] leadership. He said now somebody helped
[41:23] you when you made your first step when
[41:26] you were born. He said and your last
[41:28] step you will ever make someone will be
[41:30] leading you.
[41:32] See that's right. I want you to reme
[41:34] remember that it's not you. Somebody
[41:36] started it and somebody will finish it.
[41:39] Amen. Somebody led you. your first step
[41:43] and your last step. Somebody will be
[41:45] leading you. We have to be led. You
[41:48] know, God likened us unto sheep. And did
[41:52] you know sheep cannot lead itself?
[41:54] He'll wander away and stray lost as ever
[41:59] cuz it can't lead itself. So somebody
[42:02] have to lead it. And sometimes the
[42:04] shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep.
[42:07] Now that was back in the days of Jesus.
[42:10] He was the good shepherd that led the
[42:12] sheep. But today, you see, we're living
[42:15] in another day. Everything is changed
[42:16] and perverted. You know what man has
[42:19] leading the sheep now?
[42:23] Goats. You know where the goat leads
[42:26] them? To the slaughter. Right. Straight
[42:29] to the
[42:30] slaughter. Them little sheep don't know
[42:32] where they're going. So the goat goes up
[42:34] a pen up the slaughter. And the sheep
[42:37] don't know more than follow the leader.
[42:39] So it leads them right up to the
[42:40] slaughter and then the goat jumps over
[42:42] the track. The sheep goes in and gets
[42:45] killed. See goat wrong leader.
[42:51] But Jesus the good shepherd who led the
[42:54] sheep. He led them to life and held
[42:56] their hand. See, but somebody has to
[42:59] lead the sheep.
[43:02] So leadership is important.
[43:05] You have to know who is your leader. who
[43:08] is leading you. We are led by the Holy
[43:10] Spirit. We are led by the word of God.
[43:14] That's your leader.
[43:16] If it's outside of that good behavior,
[43:21] slaughter, you're nothing. You're
[43:22] finished. You're lost. Leader or not,
[43:26] guidance on the other hand, and I said
[43:28] there's a fundamental difference, is
[43:31] showing the
[43:32] way. So I don't need to be in front to
[43:35] guide you.
[43:38] I have to show you the right way, the
[43:40] right path, the right approach.
[43:43] Remember, you cannot show when you don't
[43:46] know. So if you are a guide, you have to
[43:49] know the way in advance.
[43:52] To tell somebody, to warn somebody, to
[43:54] direct them of the correct way to go.
[43:57] Amen. So the prophet preached a message
[44:00] a guide as well. And he said, "Now a
[44:03] guide has to know the way. He has to
[44:05] know where he's going and what he's
[44:08] doing and how to take care of you along
[44:11] the road. See, he's got to see that you
[44:14] don't come up lost. God don't want you
[44:17] lost to know. He want you under his
[44:20] wings. He want to see where you're
[44:22] going. He want to monitor you because he
[44:25] is proud of you and he wants to be proud
[44:27] of you. So he wants you to follow his
[44:30] leading and his direction, his guidance
[44:33] and his leadership. So a guide is a
[44:37] selected man. He said brother Abraham
[44:41] said the state selects this man if he is
[44:42] a guide. And now in going on a trip into
[44:45] the
[44:46] wilderness where perhaps you're not used
[44:49] to going, it's not a good thing for you
[44:51] to go without one. Remember earlier I
[44:53] said when you don't know, you need a
[44:56] guide. When you're not sure where you're
[44:58] going, you need a guide. You need
[45:00] guidance. Amen. It's not a good thing to
[45:04] go without one. Frankly, some places you
[45:06] can't even go without one. For instance,
[45:08] Canada, the guide has to sign your
[45:11] license to the game warden. He has to
[45:13] sign himself in that he is responsible
[45:16] for you. If anything happens to you,
[45:19] it's his responsibility. He's got to
[45:22] take care of you. He's got to see that
[45:24] you're not lost. He's got to be sure
[45:27] that he don't send you in somewhere that
[45:29] you don't know your way back.
[45:32] And if you do get lost, he's got to know
[45:35] the country so well that he could pick
[45:37] you up.
[45:39] Just anytime, he's got to know all these
[45:42] things or he cannot be a guide. He
[45:44] cannot be licensed to be a guide. Amen.
[45:47] So, we have a good idea. We have a good
[45:49] picture of leadership versus guidance.
[45:54] And on this Christian journey, we need
[45:55] both.
[45:57] We need leaders. We need guidance. We
[46:01] need listen, we need
[46:04] leadership. We need a guide who knows
[46:07] the way, who went before, who could say,
[46:09] "Listen, let us go up at once because
[46:11] it's a good land. We've been there
[46:13] before. This is what was promised." And
[46:16] it's the same thing that promised so we
[46:18] could fight for every inch and we could
[46:20] achieve it and we could get there. Amen.
[46:23] Amen. Listen, when David was in trouble
[46:26] here, here what he said. I said earlier,
[46:28] leadership requires trust. Cuz if you
[46:30] don't trust, you go nowhere. You're
[46:33] still lost. No matter how bright the
[46:35] leader is, how charismatic the leader
[46:38] is, if you don't trust the leader, you
[46:41] go nowhere. So David in Psalms 31, the
[46:44] first three verses, here what he says.
[46:45] He said, "In thee, oh Lord, do I put my
[46:49] trust. Let me never be ashamed. Deliver
[46:52] me in thy righteousness. Bow down thine
[46:56] heir to me. Deliver me speedily. Be thou
[46:59] my strong rock for an house of defense
[47:02] to save me. For thou art my rock and my
[47:05] fortress. Therefore, for thy name's
[47:08] sake, lead me, guide me, and I be king.
[47:13] People may look up to me, but I can't do
[47:15] it alone. I can't do it by myself. I
[47:18] can't do because I think and I feel and
[47:19] I find this look like this look like the
[47:21] right way. So, I go in. No, I want you.
[47:24] I believe that you know the way. You
[47:26] know the perfect way. You know a more
[47:29] excellent way. You know where you want
[47:31] me to be. You know where you want me to
[47:33] go. So, I'm willing to put my trust in
[47:35] you. I put my confidence in you. I put
[47:38] my hope in you. And listen, I know
[47:40] you're a strong tower. You're a rock.
[47:43] You're a shelter. You could talk about
[47:46] the God I serve. Powerful, you know.
[47:48] Listen. So, King David could look and
[47:50] say,
[47:51] "Listen, I want you to lead me and guide
[47:54] me so I could have the direction that
[47:56] you want me to go so I could in turn
[47:58] lead his people." Amen. So, it's not by
[48:02] chance.
[48:04] It's not by chance. Now
[48:07] leading also requires
[48:12] examples. Sometimes to lead you have to
[48:15] say put your foot
[48:17] here, walk here. So sometimes they have
[48:20] to
[48:21] show. So they have to say listen stand
[48:24] up and lift your hands.
[48:27] Worship operate a particular way. When
[48:30] you're feeling
[48:31] down you say let the weak say I am
[48:34] strong.
[48:35] So they give you an example of what you
[48:38] have to do before it even happens. When
[48:41] Jesus told the disciples to go out on a
[48:44] boat, he said, "Listen, you all go out.
[48:47] I will just send the folks away here and
[48:49] I will meet you all." They went out and
[48:51] the Bible say the winds were contrary
[48:54] boat rocking all over, right? But you
[48:56] know what? All of a sudden, Jesus came
[48:59] walking on the water. Amen.
[49:02] That was the example. Because he was
[49:04] doing
[49:05] it, he could lead others to walk on
[49:08] water. So in Matthew 14 from verse 26,
[49:13] here's what happened. And we know the
[49:14] story. He said, "And when the disciples
[49:17] saw him walking on the sea, they were
[49:19] troubled, saying, it is a spirit." And
[49:21] they cried out for fear. Now, this was
[49:24] the example, but they didn't see that
[49:26] before. But straight away Jesus spake
[49:30] unto them, saying, "Be of good cheer. It
[49:33] is I. Be not afraid.
[49:35] I lead in here. I in charge here." And
[49:39] Peter answered and said, "Lord,
[49:42] if that be you, if listen, if it be
[49:46] thou, I could see the example, I could
[49:50] see the leadership. bid me come unto
[49:54] thee on the water. And Jesus said,
[49:57] "Come." That's leadership in action.
[50:00] Come. I give you the example already. I
[50:02] show you what to do. Just come. Just
[50:04] have faith. Believe. He didn't have to
[50:05] preach at that point, you know. He just
[50:07] said, "Come." He didn't have to read two
[50:09] books and listen to a tape before and
[50:11] say, "Listen, I'm just singing a song.
[50:13] You know, if I could cross the bridge."
[50:15] No, he didn't sing that. He was obedient
[50:18] to leadership at that point based on the
[50:20] example he saw. And you know what? He
[50:22] stepped out. And they said when Peter
[50:25] was come down out of the ship, he walked
[50:27] on the water to go to Jesus. That's the
[50:30] power of leadership. That is why we need
[50:32] leadership and guidance. That's the
[50:35] power of it. In verse 30, he said, "But
[50:37] when he saw the winds boisterous, he was
[50:40] afraid and beginning to sink, he cried,
[50:42] Lord, save me." Remember we read
[50:45] earlier, you see when you're a good
[50:47] guide, your your your your the persons
[50:50] you're responsible for could get lost to
[50:52] know, but you know the terrain,
[50:56] you could pluck them out. You could save
[50:59] them.
[51:00] You could ensure that they could only go
[51:03] this far, but no more. Yeah. Because of
[51:08] guidance.
[51:09] Now, brother Brandham one time, and I
[51:12] know this is a familiar story, he he
[51:14] told us one time about a sister that
[51:17] that used to teach Sunday school. Yeah.
[51:21] In a message, thirst. And the the short
[51:25] version of the story is that, you know,
[51:27] she was a a a loyal person, a Christian,
[51:33] but along the way, she kind of went
[51:35] astray. She kind of end up in the
[51:37] popularity zone. She found this
[51:40] Christianity too simple. You know, you
[51:42] all have too much rules and you all too
[51:44] formal and sty. You all operate a
[51:47] particular way. But she went another
[51:50] church and she said, "Listen, my pastor,
[51:53] he is the pastor. He's the man. He
[51:55] liberal too bad." You know, everything
[51:57] is everything. Nothing is nothing. He he
[52:00] realist. He is a likable guy. I know.
[52:02] Easy. If you hear how he does talk and
[52:04] he was dressed nice, nice testimonies
[52:07] about him. But you know what? Life
[52:10] rolled on and speaks to leadership. Life
[52:14] rolled on and time was added to her
[52:17] life. And the sisters that she may have
[52:20] fellowship with before that she find was
[52:22] simplistic and oh gosh, you're
[52:25] legalistic. You don't want to wear a
[52:26] little short skirt self. You don't want
[52:28] to go a little party. So, oh gosh, it's
[52:30] Christmas. Is is New Year's a little
[52:34] thing? After all that, time was placed
[52:37] on her and she got this disease and she
[52:42] was on her deathbed, I believe. And the
[52:45] Sunday school children she used to teach
[52:46] in the past her heard about it and came
[52:48] to visit her, you know, to pay final
[52:51] rights because they realized miss really
[52:53] sick on the way
[52:54] out. And at that point I want to pick up
[52:57] the
[52:59] story in the message thirst paragraph
[53:03] 228 he said and all at once when she
[53:07] faced the
[53:09] reality this wasn't the stories anymore
[53:12] it wasn't the easygoing anymore this was
[53:14] the reality of life the reality of the
[53:17] position she was in you say now she was
[53:20] a loyal church member so wait now she
[53:24] might have been coming on a Sunday or
[53:25] Wednesday prayer meeting, prayer and
[53:27] fast, communion service, you name it,
[53:29] she did loyal or know for years and know
[53:32] you can't put a a X by attendance.
[53:37] Loyal. They say she was a Sunday school
[53:40] teacher. So it mean she used to serve
[53:42] too. She used to she used to volunteer.
[53:45] She used to teach the younger
[53:47] ones. Loyal church member of a big fine
[53:51] denominational church. But when she
[53:54] started to struggle and death struck
[53:56] her, her eyes bulge out and she said,
[53:59] you know what she said? I'm
[54:01] lost. She said, "I'm lost. Go get the
[54:04] pastor." The same fine
[54:06] one. The same one who had all the fancy
[54:09] words. The same fine one who I liked and
[54:12] I used to testify about.
[54:15] They say he put his cigarette out and
[54:17] walked in. Here, here, here, we'll get
[54:19] the doctor give you a hypo. said, "I
[54:22] don't want no hypo." Said, "You deceiver
[54:25] of a man. I'm died and I'm going to hell
[54:29] and I'm lost because you failed to tell
[54:31] me the truth."
[54:33] Talking about leadership.
[54:35] Leadership tells you the truth.
[54:38] Leadership could tell you, "Hey, you're
[54:40] on the wrong road." Amen. The direction
[54:43] you're going will lead to destruction.
[54:46] Leadership could do that to you. could
[54:48] do that for you because they love you.
[54:51] Because they want to see you successful
[54:54] and prosper. Amen.
[54:57] You say, "Listen, go get that little
[54:59] good Hughes girl." That's the same
[55:01] simple one. And bring her here to me
[55:04] real quick. She is right. Wait till you
[55:07] face the reality once. Don't you try to
[55:10] stop that holy hush. Don't you blast it
[55:13] away with some modern educational
[55:15] doublebarrel shotgun. You listen to that
[55:17] warning of the Holy Spirit tonight
[55:19] that's warning you. I am the way, the
[55:21] truth, and the life. No man cometh under
[55:23] the father but by me. He is the word.
[55:28] That's leadership.
[55:30] Amen.
[55:33] Now it's so interesting when we talk
[55:36] leadership often times you hear positive
[55:38] things. You hear charisma. You'll hear
[55:41] bold. In modern times you'll hear
[55:43] transformational.
[55:45] all sorts of leadership. But you know
[55:47] there are people who choose to be led by
[55:49] the wrong
[55:51] things. There are people who choose to
[55:54] follow the wrong influences by choice.
[55:59] So it's not the simplest thing you know
[56:01] it's not oh god I have a good leader. No
[56:04] no no there are people who choose wrong
[56:07] leadership poor leadership because of
[56:10] choice. Not because you're misguided and
[56:13] somebody led you astray, you know, but
[56:14] because you want to you want those
[56:17] leaders, you choose them.
[56:22] An example of that is in a message I
[56:25] referenced some time ago, a court trial
[56:27] where Brandham was talking about the
[56:29] maniac man. And at the end of the story
[56:32] when they asked, "Is he going to be all
[56:34] right?" You know what brother Brandham
[56:36] said? He said, "Listen, he's not going
[56:37] to be all right." You know why? because
[56:40] he worships that spirit.
[56:42] He worships the evil spirit essentially.
[56:46] He wants that to be part of his life. He
[56:49] wants to be connected to that. He wants
[56:51] to be that way. And until he could
[56:54] disconnect himself from the leadership
[56:56] of that spirit, he will remain the same.
[57:01] Amen.
[57:03] So at the end of the day, we have
[57:07] signs, we have
[57:09] warnings, we have directions, but we
[57:12] have to be able to discern and
[57:14] differentiate between good leadership,
[57:17] bad leadership. Because if we attach
[57:21] ourselves, the end would be like the
[57:24] sister we read about. After all, you
[57:28] give your body to be burnt. You
[57:30] contribute. You're loyal. You're in
[57:33] attendance. You're there. You're
[57:35] worshiping. And then at the end of the
[57:37] day, when reality strikes, I'm lost. I'm
[57:41] lost. I'm nothing. Because you realize
[57:44] you really didn't follow the right
[57:46] leadership. You didn't really follow the
[57:48] right guidance. Amen. in that
[57:52] story and I think I'll read a piece of
[57:55] it where Abraham said Tommy Osborne he
[57:58] was up there that night when the maniac
[58:01] run to the platform in Portland Oregon
[58:03] to kill me and he said you
[58:07] deceiver said you he called me
[58:11] everything great big man about 50
[58:14] preachers on the platform fled from him
[58:16] and we know the story he was an insane
[58:19] out of the institution
[58:21] huge, big arms, stood six nearly 7 feet
[58:24] tall, great big arms. I weighed about
[58:29] 128 lbs. He ran out on the platform and
[58:32] said, "Tonight, I'm going to knock you
[58:34] plum out the middle of this place." I
[58:37] know better than to say anything to
[58:39] him. This is leadership in
[58:43] action. Everybody scattered back and I
[58:46] just stood still. Don't try to inject
[58:49] your own thoughts. If you do, you're
[58:51] going to be lost. I just stood still and
[58:54] I heard myself say this that the Holy
[58:57] Spirit saying it through my
[58:59] lips. Remember, God only works through
[59:02] man. He chose man. He could have had the
[59:05] gospel preached through the stars or the
[59:08] trees or the wind. But he chose man. He
[59:12] chose you for this hour. You know, it
[59:14] wasn't by chance or accident. No.
[59:17] He wanted to give the devil a knockout
[59:19] punch and he said listen he go and pick
[59:22] up the rocks to do that. He want you he
[59:25] want living vessels tonight to be able
[59:27] to flow through and operate through and
[59:30] in this case he said
[59:34] listen he say he could have had the
[59:37] gospel go through anything but he chose
[59:39] man. That's what he's ever done.
[59:41] Revealing his secrets and his
[59:42] fornowledge and stuff to his servants
[59:45] and the prophets. And he said, "Now the
[59:47] fellow was standing just a few feet from
[59:49] me and he had threatened what he was
[59:52] going to do. He looked like Goliath." I
[59:54] could just imagine the image like David
[59:56] and Goliath. Big burly guy threatening
[1:00:00] the prophet on stage. Everybody else
[1:00:03] running away to a great showdown.
[1:00:06] And at this
[1:00:08] point he say there the Holy Spirit said
[1:00:11] because you have challenged the word of
[1:00:15] God tonight you'll fall over my feet.
[1:00:22] It remind you of Peter. Yeah.
[1:00:25] He may have expressed words to a man on
[1:00:28] a platform, but the prophet said,
[1:00:31] "Because you have challenged the word of
[1:00:33] God,
[1:00:35] you will fall over my feet." When Ananas
[1:00:39] and Safh
[1:00:40] decided to follow their own
[1:00:44] thing and lie to Peter, he said,
[1:00:48] "Listen, this is not about me anymore.
[1:00:50] You
[1:00:51] know the real boss is the leader.
[1:00:56] The real boss bigger than me. I might
[1:00:58] like you. I might put you in a word for
[1:01:01] you, but his word don't change. His
[1:01:05] judgment is sure. It don't fail. So in
[1:01:09] this case, the prophet said,
[1:01:12] "Listen, you really challenge the word
[1:01:15] of God tonight, you will fall over my
[1:01:18] feet." Amen. Well, now you can imagine a
[1:01:21] man in the kind of rage would think
[1:01:23] about a man weighing about 128 lb to
[1:01:25] nearly 300
[1:01:27] lb of like a mountain standing before
[1:01:31] you. What he thought he said, I'll show
[1:01:33] you whose feet I'll fall over. Sound
[1:01:36] just like Goliath. He said, I'll show
[1:01:38] you whose feet I'll fall over. And he
[1:01:40] jerked back his big fist. I never
[1:01:43] moved. Just stood there. That's what
[1:01:47] leadership does. The Holy Spirit was
[1:01:49] just still just stood right there. He
[1:01:53] said the Holy Spirit spoke through him
[1:01:55] and just stood right
[1:01:57] there. He walked up to me, draw back
[1:02:00] like this to hit me. And I heard myself,
[1:02:04] nothing that I had to say at all said,
[1:02:07] "Satan, come out of the man no louder
[1:02:11] than that." He didn't shout. He didn't
[1:02:13] scream. He didn't write it on a
[1:02:15] billboard. He didn't tell them project
[1:02:17] it on the wall. He said it softly. He
[1:02:20] said it just so it would be said and
[1:02:23] recorded that it would be said. He said
[1:02:26] no louder than that. And when he drew
[1:02:28] his fist back, his hands went up. His
[1:02:32] eyes pushed way out and went around and
[1:02:35] around. His tongue went out and slubbers
[1:02:38] fell from his mouth. He turned around
[1:02:40] and around and fell down and pinned my
[1:02:42] feet to the floor. And then here came
[1:02:44] the policemen out. And they were looking
[1:02:46] for him. Remember, he was from an
[1:02:47] institution. So the police was looking
[1:02:50] for him.
[1:02:52] I had led those two police to Christ. So
[1:02:56] they probably thought they came to
[1:02:58] deliver this man from the streets not
[1:03:01] knowing God sent them to receive
[1:03:03] deliverance.
[1:03:06] Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] Talk about the God I serve. You say, I
[1:03:10] had led those two police to Christ back
[1:03:11] there in the dressing room in this big
[1:03:13] auditorium. And so I think we had 60
[1:03:16] some odd hundred on the inside and
[1:03:18] putting air twice on the outside. It
[1:03:20] poured down rain them standing up and
[1:03:22] down the streets with umbrellas and he
[1:03:24] held me on the floor and he said this is
[1:03:27] when they say is he
[1:03:29] dead? I said no sir. Well said. Is he
[1:03:32] healed? Cuz at this point they're not
[1:03:34] too sure cuz he he put down already. I
[1:03:38] said no sir. He worships that spirit.
[1:03:41] The leadership we're talking about. He
[1:03:43] wants to be led by that, you know. He
[1:03:45] wants to be guided by that, you know. He
[1:03:48] wants that to push him, right? He say
[1:03:50] worship that spirit and no way of
[1:03:53] helping him at all until he gets that
[1:03:56] out of his head. So once that spirit is
[1:03:58] in his head, he worships that. No help
[1:04:02] for him. He's lost. He's nothing.
[1:04:06] There's no no point in trying to work it
[1:04:09] up. He needs to get rid of that first.
[1:04:12] Amen.
[1:04:17] Don't want to keep you too
[1:04:18] long, but at the end of the day, I did
[1:04:22] say there's a fundamental difference
[1:04:23] between leadership and guidance. And
[1:04:26] it's important that you allow the Holy
[1:04:28] Spirit to lead you. It's important that
[1:04:31] you allow the word to lead your life in
[1:04:34] your day-to-day activities. Ask him to
[1:04:37] guide you.
[1:04:39] Ask him to lead you. Amen. He's been
[1:04:41] there before.
[1:04:43] His angels could go in front and clear a
[1:04:46] path for you.
[1:04:52] I don't know about you, but I know,
[1:04:53] listen, you see the God I serve, he
[1:04:55] could make a way out of nowhere. When
[1:04:57] you can't see it, that is when he makes
[1:04:58] it. When you think, listen, it's highly
[1:05:02] unlikely. It's improbable. It's
[1:05:03] impossible. I don't see it. That's when
[1:05:06] he will make a way.
[1:05:08] I just want to give you a couple more
[1:05:09] examples and we'll
[1:05:12] close. But in a message the queen of
[1:05:16] Sheba and I'll try to paraphrase as we
[1:05:18] go
[1:05:20] along went to
[1:05:23] Solomon to find out if this is truth.
[1:05:26] You remember I said leadership must
[1:05:27] speak truth. You know leadership gives
[1:05:30] examples and the examples are to be
[1:05:33] followed.
[1:05:35] In paragraph 39, it said, "But if God
[1:05:37] has called your heart, there isn't
[1:05:39] enough in the world to keep you away
[1:05:40] from Christ." I could remember the the
[1:05:43] stories of old back in the I think in
[1:05:45] the
[1:05:46] 80s around the 80s into the 90s when
[1:05:49] people used to have to run away from
[1:05:50] home to go to church.
[1:05:54] I was very very young at the time, but I
[1:05:56] heard these stories who jumping through
[1:05:58] the window who hiding in an effort to go
[1:06:01] to church. Now you have to drag them to
[1:06:04] go to church. Now you have to drag them
[1:06:07] out the house to go. But there was a
[1:06:09] time when this gospel was so near and
[1:06:11] dear when the books and tapes are so
[1:06:14] hard to come by that some persons used
[1:06:16] to borrow them without returning. I
[1:06:18] don't want to say steal but they used to
[1:06:20] borrow them with the intention of
[1:06:21] returning and perhaps never returning
[1:06:23] them. Yeah. because it was so near and
[1:06:26] there but it just shows you see God will
[1:06:30] make a way to ensure that you could hear
[1:06:33] what you need to hear.
[1:06:36] So listen, you may not realize it but
[1:06:38] sometimes he shift things a particular
[1:06:41] way just for you to be in a position to
[1:06:45] hear and see and believe and do.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah. So sometimes it sound cliche
[1:06:51] that we say we're not here by chance or
[1:06:53] you're not listening by chance or you're
[1:06:55] not logged on by chance. But listen,
[1:06:58] sometimes God shut everything else down.
[1:07:00] Just for you, you know.
[1:07:03] Just for you, just for you to hear the
[1:07:05] word that you need to hear because God
[1:07:08] into individuals, not into groups. So in
[1:07:11] this case, he said, "Listen, there isn't
[1:07:13] enough in the world to keep you away
[1:07:14] from Christ." Amen. So you had to hear
[1:07:17] the word tonight. You had to come to him
[1:07:20] tonight. He said all the threats that
[1:07:22] you'll be excommunicated from your
[1:07:24] church, all the threats that they lay
[1:07:25] you off at work, there's nothing that
[1:07:27] will separate us or stop us from
[1:07:29] reaching our goal. When we really in our
[1:07:32] hearts get right and our objective is
[1:07:34] right and we're going for the sincere
[1:07:36] part as to find out if God has did
[1:07:40] this. If Jesus is raised from the dead,
[1:07:43] let's support it. Amen. If he's the same
[1:07:45] yesterday, today, and forever, let's
[1:07:47] stay by it. Let's do everything that we
[1:07:50] can to make the people see the kingdom
[1:07:53] of God. Listen, in Psalms
[1:07:57] 1, it say, "Blessed is the man that
[1:07:59] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:08:01] ungodly, not standeth in the way of
[1:08:03] sinners." They identifying it here.
[1:08:05] Let's not be a stumbling block. Let's
[1:08:08] not be a hindrance to people coming into
[1:08:11] the kingdom of God. Listen, God say he
[1:08:14] wouldn't lose one and know. But you know
[1:08:16] what? He need you. He need your attitude
[1:08:19] to be right. He need you to reflect him.
[1:08:22] He need you to be led by him to
[1:08:24] represent him. So he could say there is
[1:08:26] my spirit flowing freely. That's my son.
[1:08:29] We read the scripture to as many as are
[1:08:32] led by the spirits of God, they are the
[1:08:34] sons of God. So your sons and daughter
[1:08:37] do daughters of God. Good for you. But
[1:08:40] he had to lead you too. It's not sons
[1:08:42] doing your own thing. It's not daughters
[1:08:45] doing your own thing. He have to lead
[1:08:47] you. So he say let's do everything we
[1:08:50] could do to get them in the kingdom.
[1:08:53] Listen talking about Sheba here. He say
[1:08:56] she had to cross the desert. So a way
[1:08:58] she took. Now if you are determined and
[1:09:00] it's for the right thing, God will make
[1:09:02] a way. After a while, we see the camels
[1:09:05] across the desert. Poor little woman
[1:09:07] setting up there. The desert winds
[1:09:09] blowing, her lips patching, but her eyes
[1:09:11] were set towards God. Though camels are
[1:09:15] stumbling along the road with a little
[1:09:17] bey army of a god she had, the great
[1:09:20] desert full of Ishelites could have
[1:09:22] taken them in a moment. But her heart
[1:09:24] was set. If there is a Jehovah God and
[1:09:27] he's making himself known, I want to be
[1:09:29] his servant. There it is. Don't you
[1:09:32] worry. There was 10,000 times 10,000 of
[1:09:35] angels marching with that band as it
[1:09:37] went on. There wasn't a terror by night
[1:09:40] or arrow by day that could touch her.
[1:09:42] That's the way you are this morning.
[1:09:44] Tonight, listen, when you go to work,
[1:09:46] you feel it's you alone. The it might
[1:09:49] look like they're paying you alone, but
[1:09:50] listen, the amount of guards, the amount
[1:09:52] of angels, the amount of ambushments
[1:09:55] that surround you, why you feel you get
[1:09:58] fired yet? Why you feel you shift
[1:10:00] department and the next one you was in
[1:10:02] closed down? Because he will preserve
[1:10:04] you. He listen, he will monitor your
[1:10:07] going out and you're coming in to ensure
[1:10:09] that you are here tonight. He need to
[1:10:12] preserve you for the end time to give
[1:10:14] the devil that knockout punch. It's not
[1:10:16] your time to die just yet. You might
[1:10:19] feel weak and frail and feeble and old,
[1:10:21] but listen, it still have more that he
[1:10:23] want from you. It still have more that
[1:10:26] he will get from you. But you need to
[1:10:28] follow his leading.
[1:10:31] He will make a way once your desires are
[1:10:34] correct. He say listen don't you worry
[1:10:38] the listen terror by night. The arobite
[1:10:40] could never touch her. She was bound to
[1:10:43] find Jehovah. She was seeking for him
[1:10:45] with a true heart. So he will do you. If
[1:10:49] you'll just see the simplicity of it.
[1:10:51] How simple is that? Seek him with a true
[1:10:53] heart.
[1:10:54] No, listen. Nothing fancy, you know.
[1:10:56] Just seek him with a true heart. Just be
[1:10:58] honest and sincere and you will find
[1:11:00] him.
[1:11:03] These are the examples here. They say
[1:11:06] God doesn't shine out in some kind of
[1:11:08] great glamour. He never does. His great
[1:11:11] hour is to come for that when he reveals
[1:11:14] himself from glory. But today, he works
[1:11:15] in humility to do things like he always
[1:11:18] done. And here she goes. And the winds
[1:11:20] blow and the deserts are hot. But she's
[1:11:22] pressing on towards the mark of the high
[1:11:24] calling. She's going to arrive because
[1:11:26] God will see that she arrives. Here she
[1:11:29] goes, a little woman with all the bunch
[1:11:31] of men and the maids around her. And out
[1:11:33] through the desert they went. There was
[1:11:35] no shady places to sit down and rest and
[1:11:37] at ease and Zion because I have a desire
[1:11:39] to go. No, you pressing to go. She just
[1:11:42] stayed under a little canopy canopy of a
[1:11:45] thing over the top of her. And as the
[1:11:47] old camel beat back and forth across the
[1:11:49] desert and the little woman setting of
[1:11:51] lions and things in the the desert, but
[1:11:54] she moved on. She was letting nothing
[1:11:57] stand in your way. So what will stop you
[1:11:59] tonight?
[1:12:00] Listen, they create a new highway. You
[1:12:04] think that is to ease up traffic to come
[1:12:06] to Grande? That's for you to reach a
[1:12:08] church faster.
[1:12:10] You have less to worry about.
[1:12:14] Hallelujah. Listen, he want you
[1:12:16] comfortable, you know. He want when you
[1:12:18] come, listen, you're on time, you could
[1:12:20] pray up the service. You could be
[1:12:22] charged and energized. So worship him
[1:12:24] with everything you got. So he give you
[1:12:26] alternative roots now. You could pick
[1:12:28] and choose. There's no reason to be
[1:12:30] late. If an accident happen here, if
[1:12:33] something happen on your right side, go
[1:12:34] on the left or vice versa. That's for
[1:12:37] you. How you look at it, that's your
[1:12:40] perception. Amen. So listen, she was
[1:12:44] letting nothing stand in her way. All
[1:12:46] the bishops and doctors and archbishops
[1:12:48] in the world couldn't have stopped her.
[1:12:50] She was determined to find out whether
[1:12:52] it was right or wrong. No wonder she'll
[1:12:54] stand in the judgment with this
[1:12:56] generation. She was determined to find
[1:12:58] out whether it was right or not. And on
[1:13:00] she goes and finally leading by the of
[1:13:03] course listen led by the spirit she
[1:13:05] come. You said what? Led by the spirit
[1:13:08] Sheba
[1:13:11] hear what you say.
[1:13:12] Absolutely. Every person that makes a
[1:13:15] start towards God is led by the spirit.
[1:13:19] Absolutely. She was. And the great
[1:13:21] angels guided her right into the gate of
[1:13:24] Jerusalem. And when she goes up in the
[1:13:26] temple now, she didn't go up and just
[1:13:28] set a few minutes to find out. So she
[1:13:31] didn't just come come to church to go
[1:13:32] back home. She wanted to to see. She
[1:13:34] wanted to hear. She wanted to know. She
[1:13:37] went to stay till she was convinced.
[1:13:40] Amen. She wanted to stay until something
[1:13:43] changed. Until something happened, until
[1:13:45] it became a reality to her. That's why
[1:13:48] she came. That is why she passed all the
[1:13:51] lions and the heat and the desert
[1:13:53] because she wanted the reality of what
[1:13:55] was taking place. Amen.
[1:13:58] That's the way to do it. Just stay until
[1:14:00] you're convinced. She unloaded the
[1:14:02] camels and pitcher tents and so forth
[1:14:04] and she held her treasures
[1:14:06] back. She didn't get too excited just
[1:14:09] yet.
[1:14:10] and so forth till she would sat in a
[1:14:12] meeting for a while to find out if it
[1:14:14] was really the truth she had heard.
[1:14:17] Sure, she had faith to believe it was
[1:14:18] right, but then she wanted to see
[1:14:20] whether it was right or not. So as she
[1:14:23] went up in a meeting the next morning
[1:14:24] where Solomon sat, they brought to him
[1:14:27] the things she began to watch Solomon
[1:14:29] and know that he was just an ordinary
[1:14:32] man and she's seen the great discernment
[1:14:34] of the spirit of God working through the
[1:14:37] man. So she's seeing a normal man but
[1:14:39] she know that's not a normal man because
[1:14:42] the leader he has operating through him
[1:14:45] guiding him allowing him to discern
[1:14:47] what's have to take place and what is is
[1:14:50] is is being shown to him she know that
[1:14:52] wasn't normal she know that that wasn't
[1:14:54] just man that was God and man being
[1:14:57] manifested in front her eyes so so
[1:15:00] listen they say when she saw the zman
[1:15:03] she watch it meeting after meeting she
[1:15:05] camped and watched And finally, when she
[1:15:08] was thoroughly convinced, she goes and
[1:15:11] gets all her treasures, everything she
[1:15:14] had, and she lay them at the feet of
[1:15:16] Solomon. And she said, "All that I heard
[1:15:19] those saints testify about is true. And
[1:15:22] more than I heard them say is true."
[1:15:25] Now, what a testimony to know that she
[1:15:28] traveled far. She She wasn't next door,
[1:15:30] you know, she wasn't 2 minutes away, you
[1:15:32] know. She journey long. She journey
[1:15:34] hard. She came with guards. She came
[1:15:36] with treasures only because she curious.
[1:15:40] She want to know if this thing the
[1:15:42] preaching in grande is real. She want to
[1:15:44] know if this thing the prophet prophesy
[1:15:47] and taken of the scene if it's still
[1:15:49] real. If Jesus is really the same
[1:15:52] yesterday, today and forever. They want
[1:15:54] to know. But when they come and they see
[1:15:56] that it's more than real, that this is
[1:15:58] more than man. That this is not just
[1:15:59] individuals gathering together. But
[1:16:01] they're saying, "Listen, where the
[1:16:02] carcass is, eagles will gather together.
[1:16:06] It doesn't matter what the opposition
[1:16:08] looks like. It doesn't matter what the
[1:16:09] hindrances look like. It doesn't matter
[1:16:11] what the challenges look like." They say
[1:16:13] she was willing to do whatever it took.
[1:16:16] She was willing to do anything to ensure
[1:16:18] that she could test it out and see if
[1:16:21] that's the reality of the testimony she
[1:16:23] heard. Amen.
[1:16:27] Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Quickly as we wind down talking about
[1:16:35] Phillip and Uno. Now we talk about
[1:16:38] leadership and guidance. Often times
[1:16:41] when when folks are lost, they they have
[1:16:44] a it's a weird thing that happens to
[1:16:46] them. They they get the sense of pride
[1:16:49] that they don't like to say they
[1:16:51] lost. They always pretend. And I know
[1:16:55] you're quick to say that's how menders
[1:16:56] operate. They don't like to ask
[1:16:58] questions, especially when they lost.
[1:17:00] But really, people hardly like to admit
[1:17:04] when they're going down the wrong road.
[1:17:06] They always believe, you know, the
[1:17:08] reason I do that because I was coming
[1:17:10] back the next way. I was planning to do
[1:17:12] X, Y, and Z, and I really lost you. You
[1:17:15] seeing it different to me. No, but but
[1:17:18] you're lost. You're lost. Right. So,
[1:17:22] Philillip and the Ethiopian
[1:17:25] unoch just for context, the unoch was
[1:17:28] reading the Bible. I believe it was
[1:17:30] Isaiah he was reading and God was
[1:17:33] working on both sides. He reading on one
[1:17:35] hand and God told Philip, Philip, here
[1:17:37] what I have one guy out there. It's not
[1:17:40] a convention, just one person. I want
[1:17:43] you to go and join him and make sure he
[1:17:45] in order. Amen. Make sure he understand
[1:17:48] what going on because he have a desire
[1:17:50] his heart in the right place. He want to
[1:17:52] achieve the right thing. So I willing to
[1:17:54] move things and shift things around just
[1:17:56] for that one. Amen. So in a in in a
[1:17:59] message God's provided place of worship.
[1:18:02] Paragraph 165 where Abraham say there
[1:18:04] was Philillip another one full of the
[1:18:06] quickening power. We find him down there
[1:18:09] at Samaria holding a great revival. He
[1:18:11] was in revival. No this great quickening
[1:18:13] power after he was in Christ come where
[1:18:16] he had thousands of people listening at
[1:18:17] him and he said now here hear the Holy
[1:18:20] Spirit now leave here Philillip I want
[1:18:23] you to go out into this desert gaza here
[1:18:27] I got a man out there want you to meet
[1:18:30] one man you
[1:18:31] know and no question no question at all
[1:18:35] he was full of that quickening power
[1:18:38] this is leadership in action he not
[1:18:41] questioning the word enough if the Holy
[1:18:43] Spirit say you had to go he gone. Yes
[1:18:45] sir. He not Lord I a mighty convention
[1:18:49] there's a meeting there plenty people to
[1:18:51] fellowship with here. One man you want
[1:18:54] to no question at all.
[1:18:58] He said he was in Christ. He was at the
[1:19:00] provided place where God could talk to
[1:19:01] him. God spoke to him. There was no
[1:19:03] question. Say well he spoke to me and
[1:19:05] told me I was going to be healed but I
[1:19:07] don't know. I feel awful bad today. Oh
[1:19:08] my. Well, he told me I had I I had the
[1:19:11] Holy Ghost and sometimes I sure doubt
[1:19:12] it. No, Philip knew exactly the voice of
[1:19:16] God cuz he had come God's provided way.
[1:19:20] He didn't question God about well God
[1:19:23] I've been here so so many here. I have
[1:19:26] to stand. I I have to see the state
[1:19:29] prespter before I can do it. I have to
[1:19:32] talk to the bishop. Wasn't nothing about
[1:19:34] it. He minded God right out into the the
[1:19:37] the desert. He went he found one man a
[1:19:40] uno a Ethiopian a colored man coming
[1:19:42] down reading the scripture in Isaiah and
[1:19:45] he said do you understand what you're
[1:19:47] reading that's what what what he asked
[1:19:50] and in in Acts 8 verse 29 it says then
[1:19:53] the spirit said unto Philillip go and
[1:19:56] join thyself to this chariot and Philip
[1:20:00] ran thither to him and heard him read
[1:20:03] the prophet Isaiah and said it thou
[1:20:08] what thou readest and he said listen
[1:20:11] listen to the man's approach you know
[1:20:14] often time you ask somebody you
[1:20:15] understand what going on everybody quick
[1:20:17] to say yeah listen to his
[1:20:20] approach Philip asked him understand
[1:20:23] this thou what thou
[1:20:25] readest and he responded he said how can
[1:20:28] I except some man should guide me so
[1:20:33] this is strange to me I don't understand
[1:20:36] can you help me, can you explain to me
[1:20:39] what's going on? And I say he desired
[1:20:42] Philillip that he would come up and sit
[1:20:44] with him. The place of scripture which
[1:20:47] he read was this. He was led as a sheep
[1:20:50] to the slaughter. And like a lamb dumb
[1:20:53] before his sharer, so open he not his
[1:20:56] mouth. In his humiliation, his judgment
[1:20:59] was taken away. And who shall declare
[1:21:01] his generation? For his life is taken
[1:21:04] from the earth. And the unic answered
[1:21:07] Philillip and said, I pray thee, of whom
[1:21:11] speaketh the prophet this, of himself or
[1:21:15] of some other men? Then Philip opened
[1:21:18] his mouth and began at the same
[1:21:19] scripture and preached unto him Jesus.
[1:21:24] Jesus, you know, he didn't try to show
[1:21:27] how intelligent and how intellectual and
[1:21:29] how educated he was and how experienced
[1:21:31] he was. He preached Jesus. Cuz when you
[1:21:34] go home, what your family looking for,
[1:21:36] whether they know it or not, is Jesus.
[1:21:38] You know, what your boss needs more than
[1:21:41] anything else is not a raise of pay. You
[1:21:42] know, they need Jesus. Amen. What your
[1:21:46] cousin, your uncle, your aunt, your
[1:21:47] neighbor, friend, what they need today
[1:21:50] is Jesus.
[1:21:52] They may be confused right now, but all
[1:21:55] they want is Jesus. You know, they don't
[1:21:57] want you to sit around and explain too
[1:21:58] much to them, but they want to see that
[1:22:01] you living like Jesus. There's something
[1:22:03] different about you. There's something
[1:22:05] special about you. There's something
[1:22:07] happening around you that everybody else
[1:22:10] acting a little different. Everybody
[1:22:13] reacting a particular way. Everyone
[1:22:15] expected to operate a particular way.
[1:22:17] But why you not responding like
[1:22:19] everybody else
[1:22:21] and then they will understand like he
[1:22:22] said all he did is preach unto him
[1:22:25] Jesus. Going back to the message he said
[1:22:27] listen by the time he was done he said
[1:22:29] here is water. What hinders me from
[1:22:32] being baptized? Amen. He said, if thou
[1:22:35] believe with all all thy heart, all thy
[1:22:37] soul, mind, and
[1:22:38] strength, got off the chariot and
[1:22:41] baptize him. So, Philip wasn't sent just
[1:22:44] to expound on scripture, you know,
[1:22:46] Philillip was sent so this guy could be
[1:22:49] raised up from where he was and be
[1:22:51] saved, you know,
[1:22:54] and delivered, you know, and be
[1:22:56] redeemed, you know. You see listen it
[1:22:59] say baptize him and Philip was so full
[1:23:02] of that quickening power till he caught
[1:23:04] him out of his sight. Think in his
[1:23:07] mortal body his physical being was
[1:23:09] caught up. Now this is a man full of the
[1:23:11] quickening power out of the sight of the
[1:23:14] uno. I believe that to be the truth. God
[1:23:17] could take him somewhere else where he
[1:23:20] had need of him. He was caught up.
[1:23:24] You see, that is where you could
[1:23:26] surrender yourself to the leading of the
[1:23:28] Holy Spirit. That is where he could
[1:23:30] guide you and carry you here and carry
[1:23:32] you there, knowing that you're fully
[1:23:34] equipped to do anything he asked you
[1:23:37] because you're following his leading.
[1:23:41] Remember there was a man one time he
[1:23:42] said, "Listen, I could I could relate to
[1:23:44] you. You know, I'm a centurion because
[1:23:47] I'm a man under authority. I understand
[1:23:50] what it is to be led and directed and to
[1:23:52] be guided and given instructions and
[1:23:54] carry it out. That is why I could do
[1:23:57] likewise unto the men that I am
[1:24:00] responsible for. Amen. So don't think
[1:24:03] it's a subservient thing we talking
[1:24:05] about
[1:24:06] here. At the end of the day, we have to
[1:24:09] be willing to be led. I as a question
[1:24:12] early, are we willing to be led? Are we
[1:24:15] willing to be guided correctly? Amen.
[1:24:21] Sometimes we think about it as a real
[1:24:25] task like a taskmaster type of
[1:24:27] relationship like I want to lead you and
[1:24:29] come this way and don't go that way and
[1:24:30] don't do this and that. But there are so
[1:24:33] much
[1:24:34] blessings in leadership.
[1:24:37] There are so much blessings when you
[1:24:39] could surrender to leadership and follow
[1:24:41] the right path.
[1:24:43] In Proverbs 3, a few verses there,
[1:24:46] listen to what it says. It says, "My
[1:24:48] son, forget not my law, but let thine
[1:24:52] heart keep my commandments." Amen. In
[1:24:55] verse two, blessings coming out. For
[1:24:58] length of days, and long life, and peace
[1:25:02] shall they add to thee. Let not mercy
[1:25:06] and truth forsake thee. Bind them about
[1:25:08] thy neck. Write them upon the table of
[1:25:11] thine heart. So shall thou find favor
[1:25:14] and good understanding in the sight of
[1:25:16] God and man. Your neighbor and all might
[1:25:19] might like you. You know,
[1:25:23] they said, "Trust in the Lord with all
[1:25:25] thine heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:25:28] understanding. In all thy ways
[1:25:30] acknowledge him, and he shall direct
[1:25:34] your path."
[1:25:36] It's not you doing your own thing, you
[1:25:38] know. He shall direct your path. He
[1:25:42] shall show you where he want you to go.
[1:25:45] He shall guide you.
[1:25:53] Getting ready to close and
[1:25:57] just for background one
[1:25:59] time as we stand to wind down now. The
[1:26:03] prophet was hunting one time and he say,
[1:26:05] "You know what? I go and shoot this deer
[1:26:07] and I have enough meat for the winter."
[1:26:09] and a storm was coming and the message I
[1:26:12] think the name of it is the
[1:26:14] guide a a guide. Yeah. And in this
[1:26:17] scenario he said listen he was a hunter
[1:26:21] he was a bushman he was a man out there
[1:26:23] with experience because he did say every
[1:26:25] guide must have experience.
[1:26:28] He believed in his heart that he was a
[1:26:30] guide. He was a qualified certified
[1:26:33] guide.
[1:26:35] And as he moved out, this storm started
[1:26:38] to get
[1:26:39] worse. Yeah. The one thing he didn't
[1:26:42] cater for is that at that time he had a
[1:26:46] young
[1:26:48] child and a new
[1:26:51] wife. They were staying at a cabin and
[1:26:54] he was down in the
[1:26:55] camp miles away, probably six, seven,
[1:26:58] eight miles apart. the storm was
[1:27:01] intensifying and I know you know the
[1:27:03] story and at this
[1:27:06] point he got the opportunity to shoot
[1:27:09] the game and he watched it there and he
[1:27:12] shot it and he decided you know what I
[1:27:14] have enough meat for the winter I'm good
[1:27:16] to go I'm going home but you know what
[1:27:19] it became covered with fog and it was
[1:27:21] cloudy and he couldn't really see his
[1:27:24] way that is where the training comes in
[1:27:28] so he could now operate based on his
[1:27:30] experience and he started to go strap up
[1:27:33] his gun, strap up all the tools and
[1:27:36] equipment I could could imagine, strap
[1:27:38] up the what whatever he had shot,
[1:27:40] whether it was a deer or whatever it
[1:27:42] was. And he decided to start off. He
[1:27:45] hung it there and he would do all the
[1:27:47] signs and all the tricks and stuff being
[1:27:49] in the forest as a hunter until he made
[1:27:52] what was known as a death walk, which is
[1:27:54] when he make a big circle and he came
[1:27:56] back just where he started. Yes. When
[1:27:59] that happened, you know what he said?
[1:28:01] Just like we suggested
[1:28:03] earlier. Oh
[1:28:05] gosh. Let me try again. I know lost
[1:28:08] know. I just make a circle.
[1:28:11] And when he did
[1:28:13] that, came back to as we say to square
[1:28:15] one. Yes. Came back to the starting
[1:28:18] point. But you know
[1:28:19] what? The mind is such a interesting
[1:28:22] place. It's such a powerful battleground
[1:28:25] that he started to get thoughts. Now
[1:28:27] hear what the thoughts saying. You you
[1:28:28] you not lost enough. You know you could
[1:28:31] do this. You know you trained to do
[1:28:33] this. You know you ready and you
[1:28:36] prepared for this hour. You prepped for
[1:28:38] this. You're not lost. You are hunter.
[1:28:41] You are guide. What the voice wasn't
[1:28:43] saying. If you stay here too long you
[1:28:45] die. You know if you stay here too long
[1:28:48] your wife and child dead. The voice not
[1:28:51] not saying that. But here what the voice
[1:28:52] saying. You good. You are right. You're
[1:28:56] not lost. you you're going to make it.
[1:28:58] Try again. Take it easy. That's what the
[1:29:00] voice saying. He said at the same
[1:29:04] time he started to hear what he believe
[1:29:06] was the voice of
[1:29:09] God, conflicting
[1:29:12] voices. Just like today, just like we
[1:29:15] move around and we have influences and
[1:29:18] voices and different people saying
[1:29:20] different things all the time. And we
[1:29:22] have to trust the Holy Spirit to be able
[1:29:24] to discern which voices making sense.
[1:29:28] Which voices represent truly true true
[1:29:30] leadership, which voices we will follow,
[1:29:34] which voices we will listen to, which
[1:29:36] voices we act upon. And as he did
[1:29:41] that, he came to a point in which he
[1:29:44] said he thought he could have lost it
[1:29:46] all. He said because it comes to a point
[1:29:48] in which you feel like you're going
[1:29:50] crazy. you feel like you could give up.
[1:29:52] He say hunters in the past when they
[1:29:54] become almost so paranoid with conflicts
[1:29:57] in their minds that they commit suicide.
[1:30:00] They shoot themselves, they injure
[1:30:02] themselves because they don't know where
[1:30:04] to go, where to turn, what to do next.
[1:30:07] And it's at that
[1:30:09] point he realized they injure
[1:30:14] themsel to do next.
[1:30:20] He realized that no matter what he was
[1:30:24] lost no matter what he where he could
[1:30:27] admit that all his natural training was
[1:30:30] in
[1:30:31] vain. Similar to Moses, he got Egyptian
[1:30:35] training for 40 years, but all that
[1:30:38] couldn't deliver the Israelites out of
[1:30:40] Egypt.
[1:30:42] Nothing he knew before could prepare him
[1:30:44] for today.
[1:30:45] He realized he needed a guide.
[1:30:49] He needed somebody who had gone before,
[1:30:52] somebody who knew the way, who's
[1:30:54] somebody who could lift him up when he
[1:30:56] was lost. And this is the prayer he
[1:30:59] prayed. He say, "Heavenly Father, now
[1:31:02] I'm getting beyond myself. I'm hearing a
[1:31:04] voice speaking to me. Is that you?" I
[1:31:07] said, "Lord, I'm going to admit to you
[1:31:10] that I ain't no hunter.
[1:31:12] I ain't I can't find my way around. You
[1:31:16] have to help me. I'm not fit to live and
[1:31:19] doing the things that I've done. Coming
[1:31:21] in here thinking I know too much about
[1:31:24] it to ever get
[1:31:26] lost. I need you, Lord. My wife is a
[1:31:30] good woman. My baby, my little boy, his
[1:31:32] mother's gone on and she's trying to be
[1:31:34] a mother to him. And I've just married
[1:31:36] her. And here she is, a kid there in the
[1:31:39] woods. They'll both die tonight. that
[1:31:41] wind, it'll turn down about 10 below
[1:31:44] zero and they won't know how to live.
[1:31:47] They'll die tonight. Don't let them die.
[1:31:49] God, take them to me. Take me to them so
[1:31:53] that I can see that they don't die. I'm
[1:31:55] I'm lost. I'm lost in a different
[1:31:59] context. Hh, God, I can't find my way
[1:32:02] around. Won't you please help me and
[1:32:05] forgive me for my own self-centered way?
[1:32:09] I can't do nothing without you. You're
[1:32:11] my guide. You help me, Lord. I got up
[1:32:15] and said, "Amen." Musicians, get ready.
[1:32:18] Just then, I felt something touch me on
[1:32:21] my shoulder. A hand. It felt like a
[1:32:24] man's hand. So, quickly, I turned around
[1:32:27] to look. There was nobody standing
[1:32:29] there. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] I thought, "What was that?" He has the
[1:32:35] Bible laying before me. God, my guide
[1:32:38] and judge, is standing here. I just
[1:32:41] looked up and right back this way, that
[1:32:45] fog just cleared back till I could see
[1:32:48] the tower on top of Hurricane Mountain.
[1:32:51] Just think that fog clearing back six
[1:32:55] miles, just one
[1:32:56] hole till I could see it. And then I'd
[1:33:00] pack my rifle in this hand and hold this
[1:33:02] hand up cuz I tacked the wire on the
[1:33:05] trees like that going down the telephone
[1:33:07] wires to the cabin so he could talk to
[1:33:10] his wife and then call out from there
[1:33:12] from the mountain and I was going to
[1:33:15] help him. That's when he was on the way
[1:33:17] down. He had connected these
[1:33:19] wires. He said and I was going to help
[1:33:21] him take it down that fall. And I had my
[1:33:23] hand up like this saying oh God let me
[1:33:26] touch that line walk. And my arm would
[1:33:28] get so sore, tired, and could hardly
[1:33:31] hold it. And I'd have to let it down.
[1:33:33] And I'd change the gun and put it in
[1:33:35] that steps back a couple steps up. Be
[1:33:37] sure not to miss it. Then raise my hand
[1:33:39] up. After a while, when I was just ready
[1:33:43] to give up, my hand hit something. Oh
[1:33:47] my. I had been found when I was lost. I
[1:33:51] held that wire. I dropped the rifle
[1:33:54] right down, took my hat off of my head,
[1:33:56] and I stood there. I said, "Oh, God,
[1:33:58] what a feeling it is to be found when
[1:34:00] you're lost." I said, "Right down to the
[1:34:03] end of this wire. I'll never turn it
[1:34:05] loose. I'll hold onto this wire. It'll
[1:34:08] guide me right to where all on this
[1:34:10] earth that's there to me is laying right
[1:34:13] down there." my wife and baby
[1:34:14] frantically not knowing where I am, not
[1:34:17] knowing how to make a fire, not knowing
[1:34:19] what to do. Winds blowing and limbs
[1:34:21] popping and falling off the trees. I was
[1:34:25] tears not to let go of the wire. I
[1:34:28] wasn't going to let it go no matter
[1:34:29] what. I held that wire until it guided
[1:34:32] me right in to where all that was there
[1:34:35] on earth to me. You could play lead me,
[1:34:37] Lord.
[1:34:39] That was a horrible experience and a
[1:34:42] great
[1:34:43] experience to find my way out. But it
[1:34:46] wasn't half of it. One day I was lost in
[1:34:50] sin. I went to church after church
[1:34:54] trying to find something. I went to the
[1:34:56] 7th Day Adventist. They told me, "Keep
[1:34:57] the Sabbath, quit eating meat." I went
[1:34:59] to the Baptist church. I mean, you you
[1:35:01] you name it. Church after church. But
[1:35:04] one day out in a cold shed, I held my
[1:35:07] hand up. I caught a hold of something.
[1:35:10] Or I might say something got a hold of
[1:35:12] me. It was a lifeline, the guide. And
[1:35:16] he's led me safe thus far. It ain't
[1:35:19] going to take my hand. I ain't going to
[1:35:21] take my hand off that wire. You're not
[1:35:24] going to take your hand off the

[1:36:11] fishing, when you go to work, when you

[1:36:15] somebody, he's my guide. When I preach,
[1:36:17] he's my guide. He's my guide. When you
[1:36:20] sleep, when you walk around and you do
[1:36:22] your chores, he's your guide. And when I
[1:36:25] come to die, he'll be standing at the
[1:36:27] river. He'll guide me across the way.

[1:36:35] and guide me across the river. Let's
