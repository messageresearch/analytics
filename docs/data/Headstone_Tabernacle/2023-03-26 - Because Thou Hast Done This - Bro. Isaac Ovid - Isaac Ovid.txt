are in The Potter's House Lord we stand as declare Lord looking for the hand of the Potter to shape to break to mold to make to bring us into a position or rapturing condition that we could leave this place behind and break free from the grip of sin and doubt and unfair and unbelief Lord how the enemy knows Lord as the Bible said the time is short and because of this he is doing everything he can do Lord to pull the minds and the hearts of the people Lord true distractions and true different situations that are designed to break the focus on the coming of the Lord Lord we thank you for this great message that you sent through your Prophet messenger of Malachi 4 Saint Luke 17 30 even Revelation 10 father Lord we could be drawn to look up for our Redemption we are not here this morning just to have a church service but we are here to be reminded lord of the ever-present truth that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord there's nothing we could say in our human self that can break chains but may you speak Lord through uh your instrument this morning may you take me out of the way and speak to your children Lord those that are here those that are connected on the internet law May the world go fought in the way you wanted to go forth Lord may you speak to our hearts speak to our mind angel said be transformed by the renewing of our minds Lord may you reset reboot Lord change our thinking father our Antiquated thinking our personal thinking our personal agendas and motives and Ambitions and our desires Lord they are all against your desire father Lord we want to yield ourselves the holy spirit this morning we thank you for your servant whether Stephen for the sun service this morning Lord and just end with that song How Great Thou Art father Lord you are great this morning you are Mighty this morning you are glorious this morning you are the reason we are here you are the reason we sing you are the reason we worship you are the reason we woke up this morning our alarm clocks didn't wake us up but you woke us up this morning How Great Thou Art Lord we don't know what the doctor's report will say but How Great Thou Art Lord then sings my soul How Great Thou Art Lord you are greater than my problems greater than my mistakes greater than my failures greater than my falling and my sin and oh God how great you are this morning Lord you are Mighty in battle you are Mighty to deliver you are Mighty to restore you are Mighty to heal the saved up Lord turn back the hearts of the backsliders Lord love me you speak through your word may you take me out of the way and for this few moments in your presence may you do what you want done Lord we may have our own ideas of how church is supposed to be but it's your house this morning and we give over the car to you we give over the pulpit to you we give over the instruments to you we give our lives to you Lord we surrender this morning we need you father no one else but you father no one else can touch our hearts like you could do this morning so father forgive our past forgive our mistakes Lord we coming as different people this morning Lord hustle and the bustle of the week and family issues and work troubles and neighborhood issues and financial challenges and health challenges and all kinds of situations and conditions Lord we thank you that you know them all we bring them to you we lay their money all top you said cast all our cares upon you we cast them to you we leave them to you we know you can fix it we know you could change it we know you could transform it Oh How Great Thou Art this morning Hallelujah Lord bless the reading of the word and bless the hearing of it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen thank you so much musicians just have one portion of scripture if you have your Bibles this morning would you turn with me to Genesis chapter 22 a very familiar scripture for a context this morning Hallelujah Genesis 22 and verse 10. Genesis 22 and verse 10 and Abraham's trip forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here my he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou or anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram course caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the ramen offered him up for a burnt offering in the state of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn say it Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sandwich is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and in thy Siege shall all the nations will be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice may the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning agreed to church in the precious name of Jesus is certainly good to be back home with you in Fellowship as we know but over the night we were out to Mexico last weekend and we had a tremendous time in the Lord with the Believers there in Mexico so we thank God for our Victory uh God is moving around his world he's moving around the church he's moving to the bride amen and we had a quite a time to see every service unfold and unfold and to see God ministering to his people so we salute the Believers over there in Mexico and uh certainly was a great tremendous time with the word and the theme of the convention was are you ready for the rapture getting ready for the Rapture and are you the one that's gonna go into the Rapture a real powerful uh earth-shaking campaign as it were to remind us that we are not just in church to be in church but we are we have a destination we have a purpose we have an objective and the construct of church is temporary this is just a means to an end the purpose of the faithful Ministry we all say this until we all come into the unity of the fate and we know the scripture so there's a time limit even on preaching whether Madam said one need a last service will take place one last one day the last song uh will be sung when the last scripture will be read and that's what we're looking for that we are looking for a shift to change a transformation from this this natural understanding of the message and this natural understanding of this word into a spiritual Revelation that drives us into desperation that becomes a reality to us that is not just a Sunday morning practice or a Wednesday night practice so it's a Friday night prayer meeting something but it's something that becomes infused into your life it takes complete control you find yourself losing the focus of the world to become more focused on the things of God Hallelujah you don't want it to be the other way around that you lose the focus on this great gospel to get focused on the world we want to lose the focus of the world so we can get focused on dial in on God and that takes something to speak to your heart that becomes a reality that shakes you from your lethargy and shakes you from this church canality and this church formality and that's the problem we have in the the the the the world today people have all the books and the tapes and I was I had the opportunity after the the meeting to visit one of the homes and you know and they had some questions and we were there you know speaking and having the translation in Spanish and so forth about how casual the message has become how we take it for granted and I was able to share you know but over his own testimony of coming into the message when uh he was 17 years old and in those days the books were a rare thing and when a book came it was a real hunger and a thirst to get the book because you wanted to know what else did the prophet say what else did the prophet teach what else did he show and these things and and now we live in a day when all of the books and all the tapes on your mobile device but most people spend time not in the message on their mobile devices they spend time doing other things Hallelujah they spend times giving unto the distraction and it's because they have lost the focus and they fail to recognize the day and the time that we are living in but I believe that despite all of the distractions and the news and and listen there are more news and content than ever was before think of 40 50 years ago if you didn't get a newspaper you didn't know what was going on but now it's the TVs and news is the internet is the radio it's every possible channel to try to pull your attention away from your prayer life to pull your attention away from crying and sighing and talking to the Lord but God is going to have somebody I don't know if it's going to be one person who's going to be two people but I there's a quarterback but Brandon said the Raptor may be just this much I don't know who that's going to be but Lord I want to be one of them I don't want to miss the Rapture I'd say it's crazy to spend all this time all these years in the message and miss the rapture oh hallelujah it's crazy A crazy thing to think that I almost made it no I don't want to almost make it I want to make it I want to make it in I want to know for sure I want to make my calling and election show and every service we come to is an opportunity to make our calling and election short to rise above the foolishness to rise above our emotions and our feelings and our issues and our problems and the devil has a laugh during the week sometimes but how we get down into the humanistic realm but if we could rise a little higher this morning to remind ourselves that we come from God and we are going back to God to remind ourselves that this world is on a trajectory and this world is finished there's no hope for this world there's no hope for the economy there's no hope for the government there's only one hope and that's in the Lord Jesus Christ that's in the Ark of Safety that's in this great message of the hour of Hallelujah we are not a denomination this is a mission and a message to prepare bright to meet her husband that's what this whole gospel is about it's to bring a bride into a condition to meet her husband is getting his wedding preparations and his wife hath made herself ready that's not a message to the church World less than a message of the message world that's a message yes to that elect lady and she knows who she is because something spoke to her on the inside inside and even though she gets beaten down and maybe she gets discouraged she still knows he spoke to me he is looking for me he is coming for me and every service is a reminder he is coming for me and we are here this morning to get ready what we see shall put our souls in the action to make a church that will make a Revival and I want to remind you this morning that one is a majority in God Hallelujah so if this service this morning is just to get one person back into position and it's worth it Hallelujah I want to be that one I trust you want to be that one I want to challenge you to be that one because the Revival is an everyday thing in your soul if nobody else wants this may this be what you want if nobody else wants to worship may you be a worshiper if nobody else wants to shout may you be the one to shout I don't care if you're five years old or 95 years old it must be your thing it must be what you are known for when people see you they know you are looking for the coming of the Lord the angel of the Lord is on the earth now not fixing things around for churches but fixing things around for the coming of the Lord that's why we are here this morning because we know he's coming and he's closer than yesterday he's closer than last week he's closer than last month oh hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Paul thought he would have seen it but the pranama SAT so close I could almost feel it and I know this morning we are even closer still oh Hallelujah and as much as we wish this is for everybody as much as we desire this is for everybody it's not for everybody because in every Church it has three kinds of Believers Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord but Ibraham preacher messages said hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God there are people here there are people in message churches around the world they're just hearing they're hearing they hear him for years they hearing but they don't recognize the ministry of Jesus Christ that has been on the earth that shaping and honing into born son's filled Sons Place Sons like they didn't realize when Peter changed they were hearing ananas and Sapphira were hearing pizza but they didn't recognize her that the pillar of fire had tabernacled himself inside of Peter I hope you recognize this morning that for all of these years we have been under the ministry of Jesus Christ and this ministry of the word uh is changing and more is it a Ministry of the spirit up and one day only those who hear and recognize an actor will be caught up to meet him in the air friends I don't want to miss the Rapture I don't want to miss the Rapture I don't know about you but I want to be there I want to be numbered there Hallelujah is there anybody feel that way this morning oh Hallelujah time to play games is over it's easy to fall into this trap of coming to church and I'm in the message and I believe and I believe it's not just about believing what are you doing about the belief because Abraham believed God but there was something more than just a belief because you could believe because the Bible says even the devil believes and he trembles oh it's not just about belief what are you doing about this message brother I'm screamed out have we done enough have you done enough what have you done about this message lately what have you done about this gospel lately what is your testimony I'm not talking to the person next to you but what have you done with this gospel I'm not talking to the Lord of taking on the minister I'm talking to everybody this morning what have you done with this gospel is it all over you and keeping you alive is it your source is it your strength is it your sustenance of Hallelujah you have to forgive me this morning I can't touch [Music] break us into desperation break us into our condition to know that God is Not Just A Healer he's not just a deliverer but he's bringing a church to Perfection he's bringing a church at a Rapture he's bringing and preparing our people to leave this place [Applause] Hallelujah young people are taking it easy people are doing what they want to do they want to be entertained they want to be hooked on to their Center of atom they keep it on top of all these other things up but they're missing the markup of what we are born to do they're missing the mark of the great commissioner they are missing the preparation they are missing the applying of the token on the door of your house up fathers and mothers in here how could you expect your children to hold on to this if you're not even trying to deliver testimony come on you parents up come on you fathers up come on you mothers are Let's Get Serious up about the business of God we have not been this way before but we have the spirit of the Lord the Holy Ghost itself up to bring a cry into the church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he always lit Hallelujah brother Brian I'm set on you asked a question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed have you held on to the horn to the altar are you sign and crying for the abomination in the city when last time you held on to the Altar and say Lord Don't Pass Me By Lord don't pass me by my children in trouble I have one last have you held onto the horns of the Altar and say Lord I'm not gonna let you go until you bless me I don't want to wake up in the morning in the same condition I don't want to wake up this week in the same condition I don't want to go to work in the same condition I don't want to be living the same way there's got to be a change there's got to be a transformation I lost myself somewhere like the prodigal Sona I lost myself but this morning maybe a homecoming service or maybe a Deliverance service and it's got to start with you before God can bring back the backsliders it's got to start with you who are here I'm gonna read the scripture hallelujah's got to start here this morning God will deliver your children he will deliver your family he will deliver your loved ones but you have got something to do [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah God is not trying to deliver them to show you something you have got because you've been here all these years you are the faithful ones you are the ones who come on every service you're fighting with everything you've got God God has a reward for you but he has an expectation of you you've got to do more you've got to do better you've got to do something different Lord Shake us this morning to know what's in our hands this morning you may be seated that's a problem with some of us we want to wait until God does something to change our response Lord when you fix it you're gonna get more from me when you change my situation you're gonna see how I worship you but that's not how God operates her he wants to worship first he wants a praise first son he won the Adoration first oh you don't hear me this morning oh Hallelujah Hallelujah there was some thank Him in Advance we are here this morning to thank Him in Advance of worship in advance of praise God in advance and celebrate and handsome and celebrating because I see the backsliders coming and I'm doing it in advance I'm not waiting to see them to worship I'm oh you don't hear me this morning your wife is going to be delivered your children is going to deliver thank Him in Advance worship Him in Advance you are going to be healed thank Him in Advance of you're gonna get a breakthrough thank Him in Advance of worship in advance everyone should be on their feet right now Hallelujah he's going to give you strength in your bones he's going to give you strength in your marrow [Music] Hallelujah you could never get blessed from God when you're out the spirit and the reason some of us have to work to get in the spirit is because we're not practicing the presence of God you're not praying you're not reading the word when I say pick up a spoken one book unless you read the Bible it's just laziness to the minister got to work to get you into the spirit of so he'd even preacher but God help us this morning to shake ourselves look up our Redemption draw it nigh we are out of time time is running out time is running out we are out of time there's no time left to get into the arka get into the ark before the terrible plague strike [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah intellectual Services intellectual messages people have information but there's no desperation the word has got to bring you to desperation it has got to bring you to crying it has got to bring you to a sighing it has got to bring you to our all-time old-fashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival with the promise of the Holy Ghost being just as real as it was in a day of Pentecost don't tell me you have to sit on a church and just do nothing no there's something we've got to do we have got to make a Revival whether Branham taught us what we see should put our souls into action if your soul is not into action this morning may it be your prayer Lord I want to get into action bring back the prayer altars in the home bring back the sign on the crying bring back the family prayer bring back the family altar bring back the prayer in the morning bring back the prayer in the noon time bring back the prayer in the evening bring back the Bible reading bring back the spoken word reading bring back Turing off the TV bring capturing on the newspaper bring back the Holiness bring back righteousness bring back Purity bring back godliness up bring back bring it back bring it back oh anybody want a Revival in here this morning foreign [Applause] [Music] I don't know why I'm here this morning but this is where the Lord has leading me something got to happen something that is to us some of you holding on with your sickness and holding on with your trouble and God is saying you haven't obeyed me yet you haven't done what you're supposed to do yet all these years in the message and God is waiting to bless you but he's waiting for you to do what you're supposed to do God will not do what you're supposed to do he will only do what he has to do but this word makes it clear he said full obedience to the entire word of God will entitle you to the token we know these things we have read these things we are preach these things so why are you still playing games [Applause] Hallelujah I'm not just trying to rebuke you this morning I'm trying to encourage you and push you because we're in a battle and I need you and you need me and we need each other because the enemy knows the Bible said that time is short and he wants to take out as many people before but God give us a strength as Believers this morning we are not gonna just back down and let the devil run rough shot over the church We're not gonna let devil run into your home and destroy your home and destroy your family and allow the devil to infiltrate you with the music and the fashion and the styles [Applause] I saw her young sister this week while I was driving on the road wearing a skirt that was so far above an ear wondering what was going on but she said in the church this morning and I asked myself the question because Ibraham said I could preacher I'm blue in the face but unless this thing becomes a reality to you you're playing games there Comes A Time the Bible says when and and and and the word says that seeking the Lord while he might be found there's a time limit call upon him while he is there let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts how so slow will you always be that somebody gonna be on which is a big stick because a Christian is not here you live on a Sunday morning you better pray I don't call a name from the pulpit we're gonna be fighting for your soul to try to point you to heaven to point to the glory to point you to the Rapture where you want to go to hell there's only two influences you didn't want to go to heaven or you want to go to hell choose you this day whom you will serve and for some it may be on the external but for some reason the internal with your Orcs And your grudges and your disrespect and the animosity and the gossiping and God is looking at it this morning and saying you know better you could do better obey the world and be a real question or [Applause] [Music] serve him with everything make it your hundred percent a hundred percent that's what God wants he don't want a piece of your life he wants all of you he deserves it your life is not your own he gave you life and the least he's asking is for you to give it back to him somebody helped me this morning somebody helped me this morning real Christian not afraid to tell the truth not afraid to remind you to tell you that Hell is Hot and Heaven is high judgment begins in the sanctuary it begins in the house of God Hallelujah anybody with me this morning Hallelujah we hear the doctor's room this morning we have a surgery this morning be a real Christian or no Christian at all I was sharing in Mexico at home I said the things that were not nowhere near the message 40 years ago 30 years ago they have creeped into our homes until people come to church and not in the spirit because they've been duped the Bible said guard your heart for out of your heart are all the issues of life and your eyes are Doorway to your soul so all the stuff you're watching and consuming the conversations I preached a message remember Lord's wife in Mexico and I read the scripture in Peter where Peter redeemed lot and saying lot was was vexed just by the conversation of those that were in Solomon Gomorrah some of us the conversation don't bother us it wasn't just the actions were bothering not to know test the conversation was bothering him I have a title this morning by the grace of God for the time that the Lord will have me speak this morning because thou has done this that's my title this morning because thou has done this but over the preacher's message I believe twice before he called it because I was done this thing he took the entire scripture so I'm going to go with because I was done this because he has something to do it's not because you have heard this but because you have done this thing Hallelujah not because you believe this thing but because thou has done this thing that's why I asked the question what are you doing with this message because it's not good enough just for you to to know the truth if you're not doing something about the truth because there's no sin outside of unbelief yes sin smoking is the attribute of sin are we with me so it means if you truly believe and all the things that you find yourself doing you have to wonder if you really believe because believing will put you along a certain path if you are a True Believer you will never have a problem dressing like a Christian but it's because you don't believe you allow yourself to dress the wrong way because you don't believe because they never had a revelation because if it's revealed to you then whether your friends do it or not you still are Christian because it's your Revelation it's an individual thing [Applause] and when you read scripture before there was bride or the reference of Bride in scripture there was church Jesus said Upon This Rock I build my church when you go down later in the New Testament you see the introduction of Bride As distinct from church and before church it was a people I've heard the cries of my people the first time God referenced people wasn't Exodus Exodus 3 the first time he referenced church was in Matthew 16 but before there was bride there was church before there was church there was people and before there was people there were individuals Abraham come leave your family leave your people I'll show you a place that you're not gonna figure out yet just keep walking and we know that Abraham was seeking a city whose maker and Bella was gone he had no idea how he's going to pay his bills he had no idea where God was leaving him but he was following by faith that's why he's called a father of Faith before bride Church before church people before people Abraham upon which the foundation was built because we are seeds Royal seeds of Abraham if you are in this thing I pray you in this thing you know friends oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't know who is what kind of believer I know in this church I have three kinds of believers I pray that there are some True Believers here this morning who are willing not just a sacrifice but to obey because the word tells us that obedience is better than sacrifice there are many here they want to do the sacrifice part but they don't want to really obedience park or how you don't hear me this morning [Music] [Applause] are you obeying the word because this message is a message of obedience so no because the only thing that I know that entitled to the Token is full obedience not Full Sacrifice sacrifice is important we bring a sacrifice of praise we bring our sacrifice it's a sacrifice your life is a sacrifice but God is teaching us through the word that obedience is better than sacrifice because many people they look at their sacrifice as their way in I did this Lord and I did this Lord and I'm willing to do this and I give up this and they want to sacrifice but they don't want to be I hope this thing's done you know because we want a perfect Church I'd rather have two people who want fire for god brother punch who really have their swords so drawn that the devil knowed that no matter what side he end up getting caught with the game cut because the world is sharper than I need two head sword and he always have your sword ready like Joshua are you for us or are against us because we want to be obedient you know the best place the little obedience is in the Army you know because orders come and you obey the orders you don't question the orders sir yes sir you don't say well why I'm not sure I want to take this certain Mission no if you're a soldier you take the orders and if you don't take the order they throw you in that prison for insubordination for air War whatever it called but in the Army is wanting you're taking orders and that's a problem many of us because our the orders from God goes against the things we want to do Holy Ghost you have to make yourself a Christian so it's a constant effort a constant work of sacrifice and obedience so it's a sacrifice to be here but there's also more important to obey God to be here he said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some who wanted to stay home and do what they want to do and they want to serve God by their own construct God will bless you for your obedience when it's time to pray you pray when it's time to worship It's Time To Worship when it's time to fast you're fast but you're being gone you're living as a Christian you may not understand it but you obeying God you know if uh kin had just obeyed and just follow this brother he will again blessed it had nothing to do then even with Revelation you know all he had to do was just obey do you realize that the whole issue with this fall was just one of exactly disobedience let me read a scripture for you could you could you take some more but obviously announced Saturn I want to go to Ephesians 5. just to kind of lay a few things gonna touch a few scriptures Ephesians 5 and verse 1. you could find it in the scriptures be therefore followers of God as their children and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor now this is a message to the Ephesians Church this is the same Ephesians that parallels Joshua this was that original Mighty Ephesians back to another Ephesians that we preach about and look at the teaching that's coming to this Ephesus Church but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you has become it since in other words it not even be mentioned among you you're supposed to live higher than that everybody with me neither filthiness in every form category nor foolish talking not foolish talking nor jesting what is just in jokes or is that funny Joker noise it's kind of inappropriate but are you a Christian or you're not a Christian which I'm not convenient but this is how you're supposed to be rather giving of thanks so if it's one thing that people should know you for is being thankful and we heard the message some weeks ago remember the old who preached about living in the game it was all about being grateful and being thankful because it'll be a million things you're not happy about but if you spend more time on what you're thankful for you'll find your whole perspective on life changes Lord I Thank you for waking me up I thank you I eat when I eat cricks this morning a half a crick I still thank you and it puts you as an atmosphere because whenever attitude of gratitude and gratefulness and Thanksgiving and something happens around you for this you know that no whoremonger no unclean person nor Covetous man who is an idolatop had any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God he goes and let no man deceive you with vain words but because of these things these things we're talking about come at the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience so I want to hit there the children of Disobedience because we're talking about obedience persons Disobedience and we read that scripture in Genesis about God saying because thou has done this thing and has obeyed my voice friends we have to have this word as a reality to us and be obedient to this word of God I would have done a Bible teaching some time ago on the curse of disobedience and this is where I got it from where in Deuteronomy 11 verse 1. you could put the scripture up if you want uh Deuteronomy 11 verse 1 therefore Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgment and his Commandments always and this is why I say I'm speaking now to those in the church for ye know this therefore I speak not with your children which have not known in other words I'm speaking to you here because you know which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God his greatness his mighty hand and his stretch out arm you know but I will always say this message world hasn't seen judgment yet but God was speaking at this people saying you guys know the chastisement of the Lord his greatness his mighty hand and his stressed out arm and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt and unto all his land and what he did unto the army of Egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made a water of Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the Lord had destroyed them unto this day and what he did unto you in the wilderness until you came into this place and what he didn't have dethan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of Reuben how the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did therefore shall you keep all the Commandments which I command you this day that he may be strong and going and possess the land whether he go to possess it and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the Lord sway unto your fathers to give unto them unto their seed a land that floweth milk and honey is not as the land of Egypt from when she came out where those soweth thy seed and water is it with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land whether you go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the reign of the heaven allow me to the Lord thy God carried for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even until the end of the year and it shall come to pass if he shall hack and diligently unto my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul you see the command of the Lord serve him can you tell me this morning that you really serving God with all your heart and all your soul if that's not your statement let it be your desire this morning Lord I want to serve you with all my heart all of my soul the key to unlock your blessing is tied to this verse 14 that I will give you the reign of your land in his new season the first rain and the latter rain that now may as thou mayest Gather in thy corn and thy wine and then oil and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cuttle that thou mayest eat and be full take heed to yourselves at your heart be not deceived and he turned aside and serve other gods and worship them we know the prophet taught us anything could be your God you can make the news your God you can make clothes your God you can make fashion your God you can make your car your God you can make a job your God you can make your children your God you can make money your God but he said serve no other cause and worship them and then the laws wrapped shall be Kindle against you and he shot up the heaven that there be no rain that the land yield not of fruit unless he perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you therefore shall he lay up his my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes and listen you parents you shall teach them your children so speaking of them when those cities in nine homes you see what we're talking about and when no walk is by the way when thou liest down and when they'll rise it up what is what they teach them the way of the Lord when you sit with them in the house what are you talking about when you're walking by the way what they're talking about when you're lying down what you're talking about when you're waking up what you're talking about and thou shall write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy Gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your Pharisee give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if he shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and the cleave unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves every place wherein the swords of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your cause be there shall no man be able to stand before thee for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that he shall treadable as he has said be unto you behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if ye obey the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day so there's an automatic blessing that comes with obedience and a curse if you will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which he have not known may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word so we saw all the way back there God said is a blessing that I place upon you once you obey and there's a curse that's tied to Disobedience so so many people in the message for years they're doing what they want to do they sacrifice it how they want to sacrifice but there's no real obedience there's no real sighing there's no real commitment there's no real Zeal there's no real enthusiasm I know this is not the kind of message that John but in the shout but it's a real look at your life and say Lord I want to be a hundred percent he said love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your Mighty with all your strength up with everything that's within you can the Church Say Amen hallelujah hallelujah oh my my mind we say we love God but Saint John 14 15 says if you love me keep my Commandments I want us to rise above these baby things now friends obeying the Lord and everything living right up why are you going to Shady places why are you doing foolishness how you end up in that location what you're doing there don't you know better you have been here all these years God expects more from us just obey God and he will bless you the blessing you're looking for is title obedience just follow him Lord they're following you I'm obeying you I'm obeying you and everything watch your blessing unfold Ephesians 6 1 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that's a direct scripture obedience is tightly a blessing some of you children you're not seeing your way because you're just disobedient and especially if you're here in the house of God more so because your parents not telling you to do no foolishness [Music] but if you obey him God will bless you Colossians 3 20 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord oh Hallelujah so we are here through this world to learn obedience Hebrews 4 uh Hebrews 5 8 rather though he was son speaking about Jesus yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered Hallelujah I'm being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him so this blessing is only to those who obey him that's why the prophet could preached full obedience to the entire word of God entitles you to the Token is there anybody wants a token anybody looking for the Holy Ghost anybody want more of God anybody wants a true experience then let's get more obedient let's get obedient to the word obedient to God's order obedient to the way God wants things set apart obedient when it's time to worship your worship with everything you don't worship just because you know you're doing it in obedience oh hallelujah hallelujah Exodus 23 20 behold I send an angel before thee that keep thee in the way and to bring me into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pattern your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and every service the word is coming from the pulpit that's pointing you to what you need to do to change a walk to change your talk Hallelujah husband love your eyes you obey that why reference your husband you obey that be in service you obey that worship God you obey that read the Bible you obey that pray every day you obey that Hallelujah we should singing at Sunday school read your Bible and pray every day and you'll grow grow you obey that there will be a blessing tied to that simple but powerful simple but effective beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and and and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angels shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amoris and the heavites and the parasites and I will cut them off can the Church Say Amen Hebrews 13 17. I'm laying a few things here obey them that have rule over you and submit yourselves when they watch over your souls as they that must give account that they may do their joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you and that's the burden I'm here with this morning it's a painful thing when you see people who are supposed to know better just doing foolishness and they want to know Lord how can I do more the prophecy have I done enough has got me scared you see young people and you see them missing why not in church well well well what else can I say I need to come and drag you and knock you out unconscious and put in your seat don't you see the devastation and the debt don't you believe that God is real do they see young people losing their lives people losing their way and you have a blessed opportunity that people who wish they could be in the house of God and you want to play games with this thing friends we need to pray more you know we to be more desperate those of you who strongs have to catch a burden and say Lord send a Revival law delivery young people get your burden for them because they're struggling yes it's real it's hard but we got to do something we can't just watch on people fall along and say oh that's another one no we gotta get our burden and say Lord help us help us to get in the position Lord what what else I could do not to criticize them not to cut them down but get desperate to say Lord I can't leave without them can the church say Amen Noah obeyed God if nobody no be a God and went beyond his thinking because rain never fell before he had no example we have so many examples now that we can look back to to scripture Noah had no example he couldn't say well Lord he did it before you can do it again no he had to obey God they say Noah you're crazy but he still have to obey God and build an ark against all the information of his day and his obedience led to his Blessing and his house was saved oh can you trust God this morning to obey in the days of Egypt the dead Angel was passing through the land it had never happened before he said put a blood on your door apply the token on your house but Abraham preached so many times it didn't matter what tribe you were in how long you are Jude I was not relevant is where they all be or you don't want to be whether you understood it or didn't understand it so Lord I don't understand all this thing in this message but obey take me risk friends and Obey trust God and Obey believe God and Obey don't try to find things in a message a question obey God trust God take the risk on God don't take risk on your intellect or where you see on the internet or what somebody else tell you take your risk on God and obey God with everything and watch God bless you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord I want to touch my text we know the story of Abraham we mention it he followed the Lord he didn't know where he was going he wasn't in a church he had no example but God spoke to him and he followed God faithfully and God began to deal with his son Abraham and at a certain point God said Abraham what do you want at the beginning I mean all the story and the promise of a son came to Abraham and God didn't tell him when he's going to have a son and when God spoke to him Sarah laughed within herself because she knew she was past the age of childbearing Not only was she past the age of child Baron but she was Barren to begin with so two things were working against her but yet still Abraham had faith and the Bible said he believed God and he staggered not at the promise of God when one month was passed Syria feeling any better no one are feeling better you're still going to have a son you know I believe it Abraham after one year two years ten years 15 years he still had the same fate that he was going to have the promise because he knew God spoke to him his doctor said Abraham I'm not sure but this is crazy I don't know if it's already going to work out but nothing moved Abraham the Bible said he staggered not at the promise every service he came in he staggered not at a promise he in the message for 10 years but he's not staggering because he knows that this message he heard is real it's true he don't know when it's going to happen to know how it's going to happen but you know it's going to happen Hallelujah is God spoke to him nobody could discourage him nobody could dissuade him Hallelujah people tell him it's impossible but he's still crazy enough to believe that he's going to have a Revival in his home he's crazy enough to believe that resurrection power is not just going to come to him but his wife Sarah and he's believing God for 15 years 16 years 17 years it's not getting easier for him it's getting harder for him he's getting a little slower maybe get a little weary and tired but he said I'm still gonna have a son he's coming to service every Sunday I'm still gonna have a son 21 years 22 years 23 years by now people say Abraham done lost it but after 25 years here comes a visitation and here comes a little boy named Isaac to be the Vindication that after all these years in the messages message was real it was real in his soul and I can imagine the celebration and the joy and the Victory after Abraham saw that boy he said it was worth it oh mama we made it up this thing we preached about is a reality and I look power to the dead church when we could say mama we made it we made it over the prophet left us but this message is real we will just be in tested we will just be in tried but we held on Hallelujah friends you're believing in certain pain your worship is that in pain your sighing and crying is that in pain you come at the church is not in pain you believing is not in vain it has nothing to do with me has nothing to do with brother over it's the angel of the Lord he called your name you have been elected like Abraham predestinated like Abraham foreign Hallelujah Abraham's life was his testimony Abraham didn't have to say much he just believed God I can imagine it doctors told his kids he said doc how how are we looking when all the technology catch up to where I'm at yo let me know because I know I'm gonna have a son Sarah are you feeling are you feeling much better when your bodies have to behavior is that probably you'll let me know because God can't lie God cannot feel Hallelujah whether it's one year two years ten years 15 years 20 years 25 years it's gonna happen I believe it you mean my children want to be delivered yes and no matter where they are what are you doing yesterday it don't matter what he went yesterday I still believe that's how Abraham had to be you know seriously I don't feel any better Sarah speak different live and again don't live in the Gap speak positive you're going to have a baby you're going to have a child just keep believing let's go for a walk let's go for a walk and talk about what we're gonna buy that baby let's go for a walk you see you see how he's trying to change your frame of reference let's talk about what school we're going to send him to let's talk about University we're going to send them to let's talk about that first service when we take him to get dedicated let's talk about the good things because it's going to happen let's focus on the positive and not the negative don't think about how you're feeling I know you're feeling tired I'm really feeling weary but if you can just get a glimpse of what the promise of God is let that be your inspiration that one day you're going to be shouting on the Hills of Glory and this gray hair will turn back black and there'll be no more pain they'll leave no more sadness no more sickness don't focus on the present tense but focus on the promise of God his promises are real his promises are short and friends they had to encourage one another and that's what we have to do in our homes every day encourage one another we are not creatures of time we are preserve utility trapped in time we come from God and we going back to God Hallelujah when you get all upset Shake Yourself and say listen I'm a child of the king I'm a daughter of the king Joy is mine peace is mine the Holy Ghost is mine this body is destroyed there's another body waiting for me my theophany is here this morning saying come on come on shout worship praise God you are born for a higher thing you come from God you were in the back part of God's mind foreign Hallelujah and a cafe in University if in Secondary School friends I'm standing here by the grace of God I've made more mistakes I have my mind list of mistakes I tell you I can't print it out but I'm still standing by the grace of God because the seed in me I didn't put it there if I didn't put it there was a different story but because God put a seat there and the devil can't mess with it every time he said the push me down that seed bumps back up and I bumps back up with the seed listen I have bones back up by myself is because of his shield you don't hear me this morning it's because of the seed I could bounce back it's because it is seed in you you can promise black it's because of the seed in you you're gonna be healed it's because of the seed in you you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost it's because of the seed that's in your children friends you don't hear me this morning listen we pray and that's important we supposed to pray but I thank God for the seed [Applause] [Music] because that seed has a certain DNA that seed has a certain power that seed is designed to do a certain thing and that sea could only do what it's designed to do that seed has only one mission that see that's only one thing to do to bring forth after it's kind he can only bring forth after it's kind [Applause] I bring forth another kind they can only bring food after its kind and that kind is Jesus that kind is the word that kindness the holy ghost that kindness Dynamics [Music] and that seed according to the scripture Iran shall possess every gate [Applause] every gate of the enemy every kid to the enemy every kid to the enemy if they'll get the sickness that seed is designed to possess the Gate of sickness up if that I shot if that seed is luster that serious designer to blow up lust up to blow up filthiness The Blob on godliness foreign [Music] of the seed in you that sea that's why the Bible could say greater is he that's in you it's that seed that sea gem that is a part of God that the devil can't mess with he cannot touch it he cannot access it if he comes close to Earth there's a power in that seed that repels the devil oh Hallelujah that seed is what puts a beacon of Life over you that seed is what attracts the Holy Ghost to be over you when you walk in this morning the Holy Ghost was here because seeds are in the house Royal seat of Abraham see that are designed to overcome Caesar designed to worship see that resign to put your foot on the neck of the devil seeds seeds are dry seeds and they are seated here this morning dry seeds up waiting for the Holy Ghost foreign [Applause] the devil knows he can't touch the spirit the devil can never go to war with the Holy Ghost he knows he don't have a chance so the only thing the devil could try to do with the Terence is to attack the world because the devil understands that the word is the conductor of the spirit so for all these years the devil had only one strategy to attack the world because the world tells you who you are the word identifies your purpose the word tells you why you were born the word is God I shall Hallelujah so for all these years from when Jesus left this world was scattered throughout all the ages that was the devil's job let me break this up see it is this way they see the people that swear but I thank God for seven angels that came and from eternity I met a little Kentucky prophet and he began to pick up all the word pick up all the woods bring it together and meanwhile the holy ghost that was bound for all these years just waiting for Clarence waiting for permission waiting for the green light up the whole High Earth all the Angels they're just there ready to pour fire they just ready to send fire but a concerned that all the world was restored but when that profit because the Pearl pieces together I can imagine the agency and get ready get ready get ready we're almost there line up online precept upon precept word upon word first seal second seal third seal for seal fifth Seal sex seal seven seal Christ himself [Applause] a son of man revealing thee son of man the son of man stepped on himself easel with the sweat back Wings everything is an altar the angel on the Earth all right and this Angel that's on the Earth this is the same ninja he was there in Genesis looking at this man called Abraham saying Abraham you have no idea how your actions today will impact all these Generations because every generation the devil will put up cakes but the seeds these seeds these seeds will always possess it [Applause] [Music] anybody with me this morning can we get a lot of shout out praise do you know who you are do you know your purpose [Applause] oh my God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] brother Branham said you got to do something for summer to happen oh God can hardly preach and brothers preachment man you gotta do something for something to happen God has done everything he could do and He will always he is built he is a nature too you know foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jehovah Nissi you call him he comes you call him he shows up he can't help himself and the seed in you can't help itself too you know you know much time you know you wasn't feeling to come to church but something just [Applause] and you drag yourself on your you jog yourself and it's like you're it's like a you know where the purple is like when you're towing a car when your seat is between you your seat Towing you because it's against your human nature your body feeling tired I notice I'm tired folk up in the church this morning you're feeling wary you're feeling discouraged you're feeling clean but but you see it oh God thank God for the seed you see you see your seed that woman who came to the well it was a seed that brought a day to see Jesus Jesus had a needs pass through Samaria because somebody has a seed come on you Royal seats of Abraham oh do you know who you are you didn't put the seed there but God put the seed there and God is coming to collect seeds [Applause] he's coming to collect the seeds whatever condition you're in when you come to collect the seeds that's why some of you you're willing to Baha you when you Baptist Church when he met to this church you didn't know God and then all of a sudden someone arrest you you're walking on the street here someone invited our services like me boy [Applause] you're crazy I'm a prophet a white man from America okay this thing making sense to me I can't even explain it and they can't explain it because a seed your 303 knows all things understand all things and he's trying to tell you you are bigger than this you don't see it yet but one day one day one day when you look you're gonna see Jesus looking back at you because the seed in you is Jesus I'm gonna help you young people get ready to be like Jesus get ready to walk like Jesus get ready to talk like Jesus [Applause] I said to them in the home in Mexico I said how are you making the Holy Ghost welcome in your home we spend time trying to make our homes welcome when somebody has to come what are you doing to make the Holy Ghost welcome into your home oh God I want him to be welcome I want to give him the permission to walk anywhere touch anything sit anyway not just in my physical home but in this body of mine Lord this corrupt filthy bunch of Rags are saying Lord oh God if you find someone that is not of you throw it out I don't want to keep it maybe I know or maybe I don't remember whatever I don't want it I don't want it I just want him to be comfortable in my mind in my heart to my lips my ears my I want him to be comfortable Lord let the Holy Ghost be comfortable [Music] [Applause] help us have the kind of home that people must walk in and say oh God there's a presence here I shared one time I went to a meeting and I walked in the room and a businessman was in a room and I always told my dad when I walk into that room I knew he was a Christian he didn't even say a word to me but the moment I walked in you just felt this man as a Christian when he didn't have to say a word and I came down afterwards he's a real Christian with the Revelation that God has given him he's living the best he could with what he knows and I say Lord let it Peter when people meet you meet me they must say that's a Christian they must have to ask the question they must know because they're oozing out to you your words are now secondary your words were just conform with your on the inside that you have met the pillar of Fire you've met Jesus [Music] is there any young person here who wants to meet a pillar of Fire it just takes five minutes you know just five minutes just five minutes with a pillar of fire is all that it takes to change your thinking to change your attitude your parents the issues you have with the children in five minutes or they're trying to explain for years disappear as if they could just meet the pillar of Fire Mama father Elder Deacon Usher technician musician Glory I won my five minutes do you want your five minutes Moses went through 40 Years of former trading 40 Years of wilderness training and in five minutes he had his reboot his restart his reset that change the trajectory of of this gospel is wood could you take some more so we're talking about Abraham and the joy that Abraham would have felt when everything worked out for him and the promise that he believed was no reality as a baby one year old two years old growing up as it were The Joy he felt as a father being how God is good God is faithful God is real and then they came a point in Abraham's life when as if the 25-year test was not enough of a test that God wanted to give him a deeper test America when he speaks about adoption he talks about he'll turn the church against you he'll turn your wife against you he truly in a bit of sickness that's not just quotes that's a life because he wants to understand what's in you friends when things are good the real you don't see it you know let me say that one more time when things are good the real you doesn't show up but you see when things go wrong re-rung and there's real pressure the real person who dresses on a Sunday and say God bless you um when things go wrong that real you oh yeah among other people you might see 50 of it but it's in your home environment you just don't care anymore Daddy personal days and then people go you see me here you see when it's out of so you see me here [Music] the moment you saw but don't start me don't stack me here and they have this weird this inflection is like certain words will be longer don't start me you know don't push me look look look look you see the moment you're gonna any of them roads you know what coming out is not Jesus and it means there's still something in you that has to die [Applause] so God has to set experiences to see if anything else is still alive it's really a test to see what is there still enough [Applause] because some people as whole good behavior for a long time you know if you go to the monks and in the in the in the forests and hiding in mountain and meditate anything you'll behave good enough you have no no destruction you have no Club no music no alcohol no woman that you meditate you're good you're good you're good 20 or 30 years Luciani Luchia change it's like the Pig and the and the and the lamb the issues only Fallen long enough but when he lamb falls in the mud he cries because you don't want to be there Wendy Pig after you beat him and you put a few memory they put on clothes and I'm both tire and lock him in your house for today yes and he behaving in good behavior no because you can't get out he goes to the shower like everybody putting on deodorant everything but the moment you forget it all open and he finds himself outside and you see that Monday he said wait no wait wait hold on hold on hold on you know a long I see mud I forget how good money is this this month here and he's had a dance up and live and when it is is to try to pull him back out today because this is nature and all of us have a Wonder called wants to kill because our nature is at war with his nature and before God could ever give anybody power he has to make sure that your nature not there everybody and it happens so many of us and he gave some people a little bit of power a little bit of power and they see what they made up they say listen I can't give you any more you know so you should get a little promotion a little just a little promotion and before you know it they're moving a whole different kind of way but it was something but there's a man called Ibraham God help us to be more like Abraham [Applause] that When God Says time to do something for me he said take your boy and come up and offer him up and I try to wonder what would have gone to Abraham's mind because we are human he is a man he loved his son but he still has to walk and trust God I had to find his scriptures because this will be no will be to fly and if he's a God he didn't he wasn't and Abraham is [Music] AAC is no fool you see I see everything here where is he where's he lamb something where is he laughed and they go up there and you see them we read the scripture that God had to call Abraham twice because he was prepared to obey completely he was a better sacrifice the thing that he held there obeyed to the point of giving up what he held there what he worked hard for what he waited hard for Young Brother young sister father mother are you prepared to obey to the point of giving up what you hold there God would have known If Abraham was speaking is it because Abraham he had to call him twice because he was ready to kill his son and God could say to Abraham because thou has done this thing so the whole blessing to Abraham of in blessing I Will Bless thee and and thy seat I possessed together his enemy was as a direct result of his obedience I want to challenge you young sisters live for God the word requires you to dress modestly can you not obey God the world requires you to live in purity can you not obey God and watch God bless you for obeying his word you young Brothers can you not live for God and Leave the World Behind all the linemen and the partying and the groups and all his foolishness and have a real testimony and what God bless you for obeying God your parents in here can you obey God and watch God bless your home for obeying God husbands wives all of us you know but overnight we're having this conversation God Don't Make halfway Christians but a Christian could be halfway go to make halfway preachers but the preacher could be halfway go to make halfway deacons what a dick can be halfway he will make halfway could be halfway here to make happy musician but a musician could be halfway get ready are you living for God for all the way from the message believing God but Abraham said well no whatever Abraham said then Lord now Lord I want to ask you something me here and I received this boy and poor Sarah can hardly get around she is so old and she says wrinkled up he said he must be around went in this human and secret room and I am an old man have to lead on our staff and walking and just barely can walk and I'm soul and this boy is a young man I see what you've done but you mean me to kill him it'll tear my heart out you're going to kill him but Abraham didn't stagger the prophet said he didn't know how it wasn't his business the question he obeyed I love that it wasn't his business the question half of the problem with us at times we question God too much when God wants us just obey him in a message said no Abraham one thing I want you to notice he obeyed God's word to the letter always remember that that's my message the prophet said you must obey the word and knowing anything contrary to it leave it alone it may look good but don't reason against God's word you know when I was in Mexico one of the head Deacons he asked me in the shortest phrase possible what advice would I give to a young person in 2023 and my response to him was very simple and something I've said for many many years live your life as if Jesus is in the room with you short and simple live your life as if Jesus is in the room with you and if Jesus would you have that conversation would you watch that thing will you be disrespectful if Jesus in your room would you operate that way in your school if you know Jesus right there with you if you could train yourself to be that way that's the kind of thing that attracts you holy also know because he is watching it's not like he's not watching he's watching you in the expedition of the second churches of Philadelphia to change but Abraham said God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him totally committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is a lord he speaks and she obeys for that is Hoodie light may we be the kind of people that obeying God is not out of force or just out of obligation but she obeys for that is her Delight we take pleasure it obeying our Lord oh Hallelujah can I read a quote one more time God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own you see we talk about that seed brought you here he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone you don't belong to nobody else but the Lord she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the ocean he is her head for Christ is ahead of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is honey light in the Ephesians Church age brother Brown said did you get it now there are those twins again they are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefit them by the same son for they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God listen carefully exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the sea that is untied the word of God and changes it where it wants to you see the problem now where you want some things but you don't want all one tree is identified by you heard it there exactly as God give it and loves and obeys it the other tree changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock the prophet says stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of Darkness of Satan I'm just one or two more quotes and I'm done now the family of God in the message God's only provided place of worship now the family of God obeys the order of the family of the father of the family you hear what I said there the family of God obeys the order of the father of the family so God is looking for obedient children you know it's not taking more frustrating than a disobedient child we say a hard head I'll tell you something yeah and then went again tell you not to do it and we have some hard-head people in church you know yes in church and it's still can't fix these things not the family of God obeys the order of the father of the family and he is a prince of peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his dominion and Reign there shall be no end the government shall be upon his shoulders and him being Governor King Emmanuel first last Prince of Peace the Mighty God Everlasting father every one of his children obey every word to the order because they are part of him so you know who will still run out because it shouldn't obey him they are part of that family or if this is the word of God from the sadistan churches if this is the word of God which indeed it is then it must be obeyed failure to obey would bring judgment from God's provided away for this day like Naaman dipping in the waters of Jordan why he said the waters in up in his country is much cleaner and better but that wasn't where the Prophet said dip here he dipped once leprosy still there six times it was still there he had to obey and come God's way and when he fully obeyed God's way the leprosy left and I say tonight if we obey God's provided way leprosy will leave sickness will leave everything will lead but we've got to come his way for this day now dipping in the Jordan won't do any good no for that was for Neiman the laws for the Jews Grace is by Christ but each age has its part of the Gospel already predicted the Bible is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ there can be no more added to it or anything taken away from it the person who does it is cursed we cannot add nothing to it take nothing we met we must look in him and see what's promised for this age and then see it happen listen friends and I'm cozy with this this is the only way for you to please God is to obey him so you want to please God and Jesus said this if you love me keep my Commandments the only way to please God is to obey him may the Lord will she bless you this morning church and I want to challenge you obey him build back the family altar obey him dress like a Christian obey him live like a Christian obey him drop your oats obey him forgive your brother forgive your husband forgive your wife forgive your children forgive the Usher forgive your Deacon forgive me Pastor forgive everybody forgive your enemies because that's what we're supposed to do he said do good to them that hate you you'll be in that part [Music] Lord I want to obey you in everything I want to obey You by coming to church that's a that's part of obeying God I want to obey You by singing with all that I have when it's time to pray I want to pray when it's time to worship I Want To Worship anybody feels that way [Music] let's just power heads no matter what [Music] come stands no matter what the sin to wish [Music] hello [Music] Lord we love to work ship you very long hello [Music] Lord we love to wear let's just pray Lord Heavenly Father Lord you know the burden Lord knowing that time is short Lord and each of us will hear those words one day because thou has done this thing it's a choice it's a choice to obey it's also a choice to disobey Lord we read the scripture in Deuteronomy where you said you give them a blessing on this day a blessing if they obey and I curse if they disobey Lord sometimes we take for granted that we have time we take for granted that we have other chances other opportunities and Lord we when we don't hold time we assume that we'll always be able to make things right but that's not what the Bible teaches us LOL it's a judgment seat and because there's blood on the Judgment seat it's a messy seat Lord we all have fallen short Lord of full obedience Lord of taking these Commandments in your word and making it our life testimony or a walk or talk we have Lord aloud so many different things to distract us and pull us and Lord when we reflect on what's really important and what's really not important Lord we lord we see we need your help we need a fresh touch we need to Lord reconnect we need to reevaluate we need to reassess there are things that we want
