[38:37] in thine own special your way.
[38:44] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God,
[38:48] eternal father
[38:50] in song. We have asked for you to come
[38:54] in our hearts. We need you to come,
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. In our minds, we cannot do
[39:00] anything if you don't come.
[39:03] And so, Father, we are dependent on you.
[39:06] And to do that, we yield ourselves.
[39:09] We yield our body, your soul, and spirit
[39:11] to you. The word is yours. The people
[39:14] are yours. I am yours. And without you,
[39:17] nothing can be done. And so, we depend
[39:20] on you, Lord, in the little time that we
[39:22] have that you speak to hearts.
[39:25] Speak to me too, Lord, cuz I need help
[39:28] for myself. And so, we pray that you
[39:31] will take full charge. Thank you for the
[39:33] songs. Thank you for those who made it
[39:35] out. We pray for those who are listening
[39:38] on the internet. I pray that you will
[39:41] bless us all. Have your own way now as
[39:43] we surrender ourselves to thee. And if
[39:46] there's anything that we have done that
[39:48] would not have been right, we beg for
[39:49] mercy and we plead the token. We plead
[39:53] the blood and we know when I see the
[39:55] blood, I'll pass away. So have your own
[39:58] way tonight in Jesus precious name.
[40:01] Amen. And amen. God bless you.
[40:06] Amen. Amen. Amen. You turn around and
[40:10] greet
[40:12] somebody next to you.
[40:15] Amen.
[40:18] Amen. You can have your seats.
[40:21] And
[40:23] I don't have a lot of time, so help me.
[40:26] And I need your help because I'm from a
[40:28] little place way back in Grenada.
[40:31] So I am not international.
[40:33] So I am praying for the God to help me
[40:36] and that you would help me also so that
[40:39] I'll be able to slip in a little thought
[40:41] within the time that we have. I when we
[40:44] were coming up we see a lot of traffic
[40:45] and a lot of um challenges but by the
[40:48] grace of God we are here.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; I actually came to Trinidad to rest but
[40:55] I realized when you come by brother oid
[40:57] he have to rest.
[41:01] So I I accepted the the invitation and I
[41:05] said, "Okay, brother." Because we are
[41:07] fraternal brothers and we go back a long
[41:10] way and in Trinidad um I always try to
[41:15] ensure that I listen to him when he's
[41:17] preaching because you have a real man of
[41:19] God here. So I greet you all
[41:25] from Headstone Tabernacle. And I had to
[41:27] write this down because like I said I'm
[41:29] just passing through and I if I miss
[41:31] anybody it is not intentional
[41:34] and I want to greet the church and I
[41:37] extend sincere and fraternal greetings
[41:39] to brother and pastor Reverend Oid and
[41:42] his distinguished clergy members that
[41:44] stand behind him in support. But I also
[41:47] must ask permission to extend special
[41:50] greetings to brother Isaac. Raise up
[41:52] brother Isaac.
[41:54] and um
[41:57] and and I see in him uh uh something a
[42:02] chip of the old block. There are other
[42:04] chips
[42:06] but they know old as that. So I I I
[42:10] greet him and encourage him to keep
[42:11] pressing and God knows exactly what he's
[42:14] doing and there's always somebody to
[42:17] step in and we are getting older.
[42:19] Brother Oven and I incidentally are same
[42:22] age.
[42:23] So we found that out recently and we
[42:26] were trying to figure out who look
[42:28] older.
[42:30] So I look older and he is right behind.
[42:35] So by the grace of God, I trust that we
[42:37] have a little time here.
