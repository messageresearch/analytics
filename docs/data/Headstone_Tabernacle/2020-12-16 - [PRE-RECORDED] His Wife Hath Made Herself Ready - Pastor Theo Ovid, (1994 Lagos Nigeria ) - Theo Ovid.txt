father have your own way in jesus name we are scared amen and amen you may be seated praise his wonderful name well we are here [Applause] something about the final service i'm not much of a talker this part but on behalf of my wife since ameri and myself i would like to express my gratitude to you the believers in nigeria and to thank you the host pastor by the ulu and the lagos church for the hospitality and the invitation to come and i know and i know that if the meeting will close now it would have been voted all i want to appreciate all the pastors and the churches for coming out to the meetings and i know that and i believe in my heart it will be a blessing and has been a blessing to all the believers from the east and the west and the north and the south and to me i believe is just a food of indication that the seventh seed is broke because when the seventh seal broke there was silence on the devil they knew nothing about it but listen to what the prophet said in a message called influence 1963 he said what we have seen happen shall put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in phoenix that people will be flying in from europe to see what's taking place they will say there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even written in the bible is being manifested you mean the thunders is to be manifested amen so truly we are happy to be here and we know that uh that if we don't see each other on this side we will meet in the morning but we will meet amen so go we stand because we want to turn our bibles to matthew 25 revelation 19 and revelation 21 for scripture reading tonight praise god the miracle of the transforming power of the word seed in you what a message this morning to know that everything is in that sea and that seed is inside of you the miracle is inside that seed inside of you so one soul another reap but god gave the increase so maybe that miracle could come out tonight oh praise be to jesus because you already identified this morning that that miracle is in that seed amen so reading from matthew 25 then shall the kingdom of heaven be lightened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five are foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lambs while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slipped and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bragging comet go yell to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the fool is said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lambs are gone out but the wise answered saying not so at least there not be enough for us and you but go he rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i said to you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the dean or the hour wherein the son of man cometh reading from revelation 19. reading from verse 5 and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all your servants i needed fame both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunder and saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready unto her was granted that she should be arraigned and finally clean and white for the fine linen is the writings of the saints and he said unto me right blessed the day which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he say unto me these are the true saiyans of god revelation 21 1 verse 9 and they came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife may god a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated well for tyler tonight his wife had made herself ready subject wrapping ourselves in the gown of his promised word inspiration the call to the marriage supper of the lamb there is going to be a wedding friends jesus is getting married oh he is looking for a bride he have been looking for a long time oh praise this wonderful name i want to strike something here i'm sure it's the father he says here if you ask me for an oak tree and i give you acorn potentially you have an oak tree it's in seed form and when you want god in your life just accept him as your savior potentially you are a full statute son of god you will grow into the statue of god just like an acorn grows in the oak tree the people here in arizona you raised oranges first it's a seed the seed rocks the seed the corner wheat must fall into the ground as jesus said about himself it's got to run and the only thing that you can do the only way is to accept the germ of life of god's word and then erupt to your own ideas it's none of my business i try to figure it out i can't figure it out i just believe it he never asked me to figure it out he never did say did you feel it he never did say did you understand it he said did you believe it don't try to go to some seminary and get some of this undocumented embalming fluid put into you some social creed the thing you want is the baptism of the holy spirit the incarnate power of god dwelling in you that accept this word and makes it live out as it really is a wrong and around the world and be for all kinds of people oh my hallelujah glory to god a little orange tree now when you plant it when you get it at least a sprig about so big you plant it that's all you have to do it you don't have to go and say no i've got to get me some oranges somewhere and you're going to dump it into it the oranges is already in it the oh man just like what oblivion said this morning the miracle is in the sea the prophet said when you put that stick in there and that stick is there he said the oranges is already in it watch the only thing that tree has to do you have to have plenty of water on it and then the only thing the tree has to do is to drink and it drinks and drinks till it drinks over its amounts and as it drinks it pushes out limbs it drinks more it pushes out leaves it drinks more it pushes out blossom it drinks more it pushes out oranges drink and push drink and push drink and push drink and push oh hallelujah praise god amen so when we are planted together in christ the only thing we have to do is to drink from his promise and push out because everything that you have need of is in you when you receive christ oh hallelujah that means a third pearl oh

song oh my you may be seated glory chris corinthians 14 6 that's not brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine and even things without life given sound with a pipe or heart listen except they give a distinction in the songs how shall we know what despite our heart for if the trumpet gives an uncertain song who shall prepare for the battle who glory to god if the trumpet gives on a certain sound who is going to prepare for the packer and tonight they will find out what the battle is oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you jesus oh my listen you may be seated oh my from the messenger uncertain song brother branham said the gospel has no uncertain sound if a soul here is a bugle blow there are many veterans here this morning they know what retreat means they know what these different signals of this people sound means and if this bugle doesn't give a certain sound just a bunch of noise how will the soldier know how to prepare himself because soldiers are trained they train when i set the people's house to get ready to get the concept because the enemy is at hand they are trained when observing song is song they get ready to match they are trained they are trained when a certain song is haunted it's time to retreat but what if there's a strange song that will nerf the jump that will never shout that women have to praise god that we know what to do oh hallelujah praise god amen [Music] you may be seated but abandon says if one church says do this another just say do that one church say do this another one said do that how can the christian know what to do one pastor said this another pastor said that another pastor

god there is a call going out [Music] uh oh my there is only one certain sound and that's the gospel the promise to prepare for the battle what battle the coming of the lord that is the battle not this church versus that church the public is the coming of the lord but the privacy that his wife his wife his wife had made herself ready i could see that angel with the fire saying come tonight i

lamb has come oh glory glory glory hallelujah but i'm feeling so much better since i lay my personal power oh hallelujah [Applause] oh you may be seated oh praise god oh my oh hallelujah i want to bring back something that overlaid i said this morning about there is one body you see every country have its national spirit [Applause] including nigeria but there's a holy spirit that is more powerful that all the tribes that all the groups that go on the preacher is more powerful [Applause] because when the brother brandon caused the clip enough time somebody said are these all brand names no no no no these are your converts listen the pride will have one comment white linen and you're going to find out that you have got to wrap yourself [Applause] in the kong of his promised world you may be seated hallelujah proud to talk about five wise virgins five foolish but the wise was wise enough to get extra oil the wise wasn't satisfied to be a good church member [Applause] [Music] the wife the wise wasn't satisfied to have a ministry with no power the wise wasn't satisfied for a church with no anointing for a church without no faith just to say i have a church what good does it do would that mean the coming of the lord it's inspection time it's got to be according to the blueprint you may be seated jesus is wary of courtship you always every time you see somebody that he loves they keep strain from the word straight from the word he wants to get married he wants to walk up the aisles [Music] [Applause] he wants to get married and he is going to find a wife in [Applause] our nigeria going to be made right here oh my hallelujah praise god amen oh hallelujah you may be [Music] seated well i'm all over my god no i'm not finished at all i mean i'm all over the world gonna finish i wanna be ready i wanna be dressed in the cow of his promised bird [Applause] oh my you may be seated i think i better read that one for you [Applause] [Music] from god of his evil age he said her long hair nazarite fall sure she is voter god her beautiful ground of his promised word for the age she that she is living in wrapped around her vindicating her with himself oh hallelujah of hebrews 38 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever she is part of the word groom true to him in every point and if a woman goes out here and is married to a man she goes out and makes love with another man she has a fear with him and to come back to her husband he should kick her out and so forth he said but the bride of christ is vowed to christ and he is the word not even a wink at the other side in other words this bride must even wink at the interpretation don't even wink at a man's eye there don't have 18 years to hear every everything [Applause] [Music] got to know the real thing [Applause] oh my god you may be seated blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah notice a very strange thing in this age of grace when god has taken a people for his name's sake that is his pride in this evil aid that should be called the age of evil the very age that god is calling a people for his namesake by grace and it's an evil age very strange to think of that that in an evil age like this that god then would be calling his bride did you notice he said a people not a church so anytime somebody say my church better than your church forget it you are free christopher liberto you are free christ is your liberty grace is your freedom [Music] you're gonna be sick but did you notice he said a people not a church why yet it's called the church but he would call up people now a church is a gathering of many people of all different makeups but god is calling one here he didn't say i will call the methodist the baptist or the pentecostal he said he will call a people what for for his name a people one from the methodist one from the baptist [Applause] one from the lutheran one from the catholic but he is calling not a church group but a people so no man have any right to find the people of god let them go and i mean it praise god i am serving a summons to every pharaoh in nigeria hallelujah glory to god the enforcer is here the holy spirit is here the angel is here let my people go [Applause] [Music] oh playing game is over the shock is dead the seat is dead right and nothing happens you heard that this morning outside the sea term oh hallelujah one of these days only the bride will walk him with life all the life of the shock will be guided up in the brain and the pride will be the talking on the earth [Applause] the pride will be the final voice on the earth [Applause] if anybody want to talk to god god but say talk to my wife hallelujah if she say hired you're hired if you're fired you are tired my voice isn't hurt oh my i feel good oh hallelujah something is moving glory to god oh hallelujah before the fall adam didn't have to use jesus name adam said tree move mountain move he didn't have to use jesus name and the pride oh hallelujah when she come one with the reveal word the mate she don't even have to use jesus said if you shall say and don't tell you're gonna have what you say how's that how i arrive the church should be in speaking conditions with god oh glory to god oh my god oh man he's calling another church group about the people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of him by predestination just as a man that chooses a right wife in life was ordained to be part of his body so the bride of christ will be and is now from all ordained by god to be part of that body so it is not a church here a church there there is one body that is why you hear so much about ephesians because there is one law and he is the head of that body [Applause] and if the head moves so and the body moves so something is wrong because my head move my body is going because the body and the head is connected together my body is moving one way and the head moving the next way wherever my head move my body is moving and when jesus become the headship over the bride's body oh hallelujah every move is thus saith the lord you maybe see know this what someone call what what not not what someone called but what god chose before the foundation of the world [Music] [Applause] and in these days he's calling not an organization a people for his name and this evil age is when he's doing it the very age of deception and matthew 224 it was the most deceiving age of all ages all ages of his seat watch from the garden of eden all the way down there has never been an age so deceptive as they say false prophets with rights show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very lit just a coal formal statue churches so forth of manthology wouldn't the elect would never pay no attention to that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do not two words just one that's why the pride will be wrapped in the kong of his promised word nothing will be left out [Applause] [Music] you may be seated what would god call a people out of this evil age for his name you want to hear why the reason it is is to try here [Applause] no i can't expect that i don't expect a show for that one but it's still the word you mean he called the people of the trial yes you want to prove to the devil that this spread is not like you she can face the test anywhere anytime any place on any condition she will stand are you with me oh glory to god oh my god hallelujah oh praise be to jesus you may be seated we find out this evil age is to prove the satan but like eve she is not that type of a woman she will be tried by his word oh my the bride watch uh she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word adam's bride believed every bit of the word but was confused on one promise that he was the same yesterday then forever but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that is called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact with the same team you mean that's why not being so rough over the years of course if you went to the angel and you took the book it's supposed to be sweet in the mouth and it's supposed to be bitter in the belly so what you're complaining about [Music] we're talking about wife of the lamb [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh glory hallelujah you may be seated now watch for my message only one true living church 1951 he said the gospel commonly believed is the word of god now that is true in one sense but the word of god is not gospel alone amen the word of god is the seed that produces the gospel but jesus said i saw went forth to sew some fell in stone places some fell on the way side falls of the eddy of all them some fell upon twenty tissues ground some went over brought a hundredfold now the seed you people here were farmers every single produce of its in the right kind of ground and every divine promise of god in the bible will produce if it's met in the right kind of our heart it will produce the promise but watch not the right kind of a head the right kind of a heart so the ground has to be prepared now watch you say if you need of salvation believe that he saves you accept his sacrificial debt and you shall receive what you ask for if you are wary and gloomy and feel like everyone is against you come unto me all your labor heavy later i will give you rest that's a seal accepted if you are sick he was wounded for our transgression with the strikes we are healed accepted it's a sea it will produce you may be seated when you saw a sea you don't dig it up every morning to see it come to pass if you do your sea will never come up you got to plant it commit it to the earth let it alone it's up to nature god to water it and the seed it produces so that's the way you do in the word of god accept it in good heart already fertilized all the creepers and the rocky places and the stony doubts taken away good rich soil of fate believe it commit it to god walk away testifying that you have received what god has promised you and he's the high priest of your confession if you don't confess nothing you can't intercede on your behalf but when you say by his child i am healed i can see you here you heard that oh hallelujah he claimed this healing he claimed the ceiling he claimed as he learned my call the angel is about to do something about it oh hallelujah because then you have the sea to produce a miracle oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] glory hallelujah you may be seated whenever jonathan spoke about the holy ghost that the holy spirit said the hungering in the half of the holy ghost there was a seed spoken inside of you and my god it persevered received the holy ghost that was the seed i knew that produced a miracle god set that hunger inside the deal and the word said blessed are they that hunger just the hunger is to be blessed just to be hungary tonight just to be blessed [Applause] oh glory hallelujah praise god so what and the gospel that was in that day it's written in the word as history a painted fire what words oh man you cannot warm somebody with the pain that fire they cannot feed somebody with a picture of food as much as the picture looking good they can't see them with a picture of food they've got to produce the food oh hallelujah praise god and the gospel is to syndicate that jesus christ it's the same yesterday and forever [Applause] oh hallelujah praise god amen [Applause] you may be seeing the gospel that was in that day's history a penalty of what was accept the same seed that they accept and it will be a living reality in you that will bring you into the same experience that they had you see reverend branham is that truth according to the scripture the great sin paul said the gospel comes nothing will only but through the power and demonstration of the holy ghost and when jesus commissioned the church he said go into all the world and preach the gospel mark 16. go into all the world preach your gospel to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe oh hallelujah praise god amen okay we're on home stretch listening is from siege i possess the gate long beach california speaking about abraham he said god had tried his patriarch he had tried his servant and every son that committed god must be what tried chastened that's where many fall away because we can't stand the trial a person come to the authentic time of revival you watch just a little while and the hot trash began to come watch the soul when fought so in a sea some fell amongst tony graham some fell among tones and tissues but some fell among good wrong see they don't do look good at all others come overnight they're going to do a great things and so forth but when the trials come it chokes them but some go all the way on good ground and bring forth a hundred fold you see all the services that has gone forward we don't want to fall at the fallen rocky ground we don't want the fallen stony ground he wanted to fall on good ground [Applause] and it has fallen on good ground oh hallelujah now listen to this from recognizing today's message he said no he promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seed that would be sown for this day the seed is here the seed is the bible he said jesus said so the word is the seed of the source now before you can have a crop no matter if you sow the seed it's got to have light to ripen that seed or it will rot or it won't do no good it will perish but if it got the seed in the ground the right ground with the right kind of a sunlight on it it's got to ripen and he promised that in the last days in the evening time the sun would come up to right in that seed the seed is being preached [Applause] [Music] and the son of god is ripening that seed by vindicating it and making it push out before you proving that it's right oh blessed be the name of the lord oh my you may be seated from queen of sheba i say in the beginning was the word the word of me flesh and dwell among us he is he was god the word christ is a designer of the torch intents of the heart go sleep in church rise ministers shake yourself the hour is here free from these towers of babel to the cross it will fall one of these days every plant that my heavenly father hasn't planted will be rooted up but upon this rock oh i'll build my church and the gates of hells can't shake it down oh hallelujah that's why we said it's just true it's lack of revelation that causes division because true revelation is rock [Applause] [Music] now i'm not talking about somebody got a dream and they see something and they feel something and it come to me i'm not talking about that therefore i am this so i am that i'm not talking about that kind of revolution that's your own revelation but true revelation that's a wrap [Applause] my my man you may be seated oh hallelujah oh praise god be getting down to business hallelujah because every true revelation must be tested including the seventh hand of revelation and it has been tested it has been tested over time oh glory to god we have stood the test oh my hallelujah praise be to jesus you may be seated oh glory hallelujah oh my my my oh hallelujah i always ask myself the question where is the church yesterday the partners on i will build my church no man says build their own church my sheep my sheep like if they're making sheep but i could see that angel with the fire [Applause] that's a different picture altogether and when you see a vision of the worldwide bride of jesus christ every small town small village small hot revelation going to disappear god is bigger than your small town what is bigger than where you come from oh hallelujah and i heard a voice said hallelujah the lord omnipotent reigneth oh glory you talk about a shout in time [Applause] what are we going to leave you shouting giving god glory [Applause] you ever see anybody going to a wedding side you ever seen anybody going to the wedding with a hard face it's only if they want to be the bragging on the bride but it's a rejoicing time to know all things are ready oh hallelujah praise god amen so what do you think the thunder was sent for to gather the bright together the shore hope to be pure [Applause] not for argument not for the bear not for this one against that one this one i'm more revelation than that one this one could caught more than that one it wasn't for that oh hallelujah court is not going to stop the devil it will take a revelation oh you know what i said quoting wouldn't stop the devil because those guys that jonathan spoke about said uh come out in the name of the jesus that paul preached it was caught into and those devils say paul i know peter i know too because they kicked me out when we were up there and they're doing the same thing down here but i don't know who you are i'm not ever going to know the pride oh hallelujah how she gonna do the very same works same life same sign same wonder same miracle i tell you praise oh god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh my seated oh hallelujah are we almost there from ephesian church agents daniel heard the seven thunders unforbidden and john heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of these seals to be opened the mystery of god shall be finished in other words god would be known into his church not in three persons but as one person the mystery of god would be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mystery be open to the church because in deer the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive living among us and then we are worshiping the living christ know every revival you maybe see every fire produces twins [Applause] every fiverr produces twins [Music] good books and deeds and esau was a probably a better a boy that if he interchanged then uh jacob what but you see the natural man when a revival comes there's two classes of people comes out of every revival there's a natural man goes and he will come the old say yes accept christ as my savior he will go out first thing he'll wind up in some cool formal church because he thinks well if i join the church i'm just as good as the next man am i not just as good as so and so what difference does it make as long as i belong to the church why it's a whole lot of difference you have got to be born again you have got to have the birthright now a lot of people don't want to get the birthright because the thing is just a little unpopular they don't want to get down at the altar and cry a little bit miss a few meals they don't want to cry they don't want the new bird because the new birth is kind of messy it's like any other bird is a mess and so the new word is a mess it will make you do things that intake you will do it will make you sound a corner and beat the tamarind and sing glory be to god hallelujah praise god you would act like a maniac oh hallelujah now unless anything dies and rot life can't come from it unless a man dies and rots in his own thoughts christ cannot get into his heart and when you are trying to think for yourself now if i walk up to the altar and say yes lord i'm a fine fellow i will take you i will pay tights i will do this you gotta die and rot right there to your torch let the holy ghost take over and just do whatever he wants to do with you oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah glory all right god you may be seated from the titan to a church how about the clothes i'm
