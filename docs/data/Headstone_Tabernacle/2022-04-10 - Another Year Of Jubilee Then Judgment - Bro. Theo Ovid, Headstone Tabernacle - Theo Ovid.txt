[Music] and when your son and adam and eve when they fell in the garden of eden you have no choice but to drive them out because you have to keep your word and it was such a sad thing to see your own son and his wife being driven out of the garden and to see the tree of life angels with swords god in it that they cannot partake of the tree of life in that sinful condition but you purpose to restore man you purpose to bring man back you purpose to heal and deliver and rescue from this house of hell father we thank you for calvary we thank you the blood that was shed we thank you for the opportunity that you have given us to see people healed and delivered and set free come among us today we wait on you come and confirm your word with signs wonders miracles deliverance a mighty movement of your spirit we ask in jesus name amen and amen god bless you and if of your bibles let's go straight to the word it's a special service today it will be in two parts i'll share something and but it's like we'll come behind and share something with you i will have a prime praise god reading from isaiah chapter 61 we want to read verse 1 to 3. daniel 12 1 verse verse 1 and we want to read from romans chapter 13 verse 11 to 14. so we go to isaiah chapter 61. reading verse 1 to 3. the spirit and remember jesus will be using these same words in in in luke chapter 4. but this is the spirit of god upon isaiah this is christ spirit speaking through him he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me this is not for isaiah now this is him in the spirit speaking the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek amen he had sent me papers to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give them beautiful ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness amen that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified and reading from daniel chapter 12 reading verse one and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even unto the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book that is not a perhaps that is that maybe every one written in that book shall we not perhaps that maybe shall be delivered a reading from romans chapter 13 reading from verse 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to a week out of sleep for now is our salvation error than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness and chambering unwantedness not in strife and envying but put you on the lord jesus christ and make not provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word come and inhabit your word lord and speak all through your word by your spirit i bless your people lord and take me out of the way and oh god a whole service today father may you be glorified and magnified and jesus said we ask it amen and amen you may be seated as you sit down give god some praises [Music] i have a title this morning another year of jubilee then judgment another year of jubilee then judgment and then i have a scripture of inspiration revelation 2 17 the spirit and the bride say come god will have a space for the spirit to anoint the bride to give that bride a voice o praise the name of the lord do you believe that so caleb and joshua they were men of faith they were men of integrity who know god said done in egypt i give you the land and that's good enough there wasn't there when abram was alive but god told abraham that you could seed with sigil in a strange land god will bring them out and they will get the land that they're going to possess so they took the word from what god said and they believe the word o praise god i give you the land that's good enough they run to the people the people mourning crying and so on but caleb said we are well able to possess that land he's not right but they had to fight for every introvert so it's your land yes but are you going to fight for it do you get what i'm saying it is your land but you have to fight for it and people have got relaxed and comfortable in the message just waiting for things to come their way but jesus overcame by the word oh glory you're waiting for the spirit but you have to overcome by the word oh glory to god it is written it is written it is written by the word oh hallelujah do you believe that thank you lord jesus now what are you overcoming the overcome by the word let me say this again god made a promise god made a promise you've got to have a battle if everything comes lazy what are you overcoming if everything god hand you whatever you want like a spoiled child you want this you cry for it god give it to you god give it to you god give it to you everything is just fine you're blessed without stress and you know people have their small quotations and so on but that's not what we are promised here now god tell joshua every place you put your foot is yours the land is yours but you're going to fight for it healing is yours deliverance is yours victory is yours joy is yours breaks you that's yours too oh hallelujah holy ghost overcoming power that's yours too everything got promised in there that's yours but you're gonna fight for it are you gonna fight for this morning i wanna salute you this morning i didn't even know that they said it would be terrible weather today and you did you didn't bother with that and it looked like god canceled the terrible weather because you had faith to come here bad weather praise god but you had faith to come this morning you didn't bother with the weather because you more burden about your deliverance than what the weather have to say and go go roll back storm weather rain go go push all that back because you want to get a breakthrough that's why you were here this morning and if you come for breaks you'll go we'll give you a breakthrough oh god is that a man that would lie you wouldn't lie praise god and bring your word for lord oh glory to god he bring you for deliverance he bring your breakthrough do you believe that so they overcame by the word of god and that by their testimony and by the blood of christ you've got to overcome something so you've got to have some obstacles can i hear a shout on that one you've got to have some obstacles some sickness here some pain here so as an obstacle god don't want to be like that oh you're gonna serve god well and you're sick in your body go want you to be healed i want you to prosper and be good health listen god desire is that you have good health god doesn't desire sick and are sick and sick and sick forget that you have to be healed that's what jesus came for for glory to god to open up the prison bars they said that liberty them that are born to heal the brokenhearted oh gloria god set you liberty listen bring you captive from physical and spiritual conditions let me say that again to bring a deliverance from spiritual and physical condition because they have demons in the physical and demons in the spiritual the physical is sickness all glory to god the spiritual is demonic activity in the lives of individuals but he promised to free you from all of that physical and spiritual oh and who you the son of man set free it's free indeed could we give the lord some praises this morning oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so before jesus return in power to read the scripture you have to overcome by the word the lust of the acts the lust of the flesh and the pride of life i'm talking about dry wood [Applause] oh glory to god because jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tested and he told that devil it is written it is written it is also written he never demonstrated power to lucifer he never demonstrated power to the enemy he overcome by the word there's an overcoming by the word where you take the word and let the devil know where to get off where you take the word and said i'm not going to back down and move down from what god said because the word itself is god and the word of power in it devil don't believe that by the way that power in it that's why jesus said destroy this body and the treaties are gonna raise it up myself because he knew what david said he knew david spoke the word i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption oh glory to god do you believe that so jesus after overcoming these three attacks lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life he was ready to go into the temple and he found the place where it was written and he read the scripture from isaiah 61 but in the middle of that sentence he stopped he only stopped up to the acceptable year of the lord and he left off the day of vengeance of our god he left off the judgment part because that judgment part is for now that judgment part is for the bride to pick up and god will not hide from the brine what he's about to do praise god and if you haven't heard wednesday night service you need to go on youtube and go in the channel and listen to that service lot and his wife and i trust the lord brother isaac i could bring back some of that this morning but lot was god was about leaving and and he said shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do sodom is already judged yes hallelujah your judgment is coming on and lot had this burden for abraham had this burden for his family who was done in sodom and he began to plea with god if there's 50 righteous would you destroy god said no and he plea and plea until god dispatched angels get the family out some mocked some make fun of it but there were a few that came out oh glory to god there's somebody to come out before the judgment strike there has to be a voice to say come leave what you're doing and come and just don't look back what an opportunity there was two t's on the cross oh glory to god two wretched thieves on the cross two big time bandits on the cross one say why you'll save yourself and see us also another one say lord remember me he said the right thing and jesus said today you will be with me he did not get baptized in jesus name he didn't have to come to church he didn't have to stay long and fellowship with the saints jesus said today you will be with me in paradise god made a provision for that man a final our reprieve final voice of mercy oh god mercy there was great and grace was free pardon there was multiplied for me dear my burden soul found liberty at calvary oh give the lord a shout you talk about the grace of god you talk about the mercies of god you are going to be delivered this morning by the grace and the mercies of god oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god he is making a bride hallelujah he is cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the sun another masterpiece part of the word jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read that in the day in the book he read just part of the prophecy he left the rest of it for the last day we are supposed to take that part you see he was cut and god wants to cut the church out like he cut the sun out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of the church church and brightness two different things and have church it's a bride to be part of the bride you have to be part of him do you believe that not part of a creed not part of denomination but part of him hewed out by the word of god oh glory to god so god won't you make you the word itself the word made flesh the word is invisible until it become flesh in your flesh the word gonna come inside your flesh it will jump up the word all the scribes these hats were scrolls and quotes and scriptures but when jesus came he break the scriptures to life he said the spirit is upon me that was not a scripture that was being made manifest the spirit was upon him to fulfill the very scripture itself and that same spirit have to come upon you to manifest revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come you're going to go to your family and say come oh glory to god and they can't gonna have to come because the same voice that called lazarus from the grave that voice of the archangel will be in her bride and when that voice had come lazarus couldn't say i'm not coming he had to come he had to come he was dead but he had to come that voice going to find your family that voice is a force of deliverance that voice is the voice of breakthrough oh give the lord a shout all glory to god that voice gonna be in the bride don't give up don't give up on your family don't even give up on you [Applause] don't give up you don't even know what happened here this morning you are sleeping right now under prophecy this word this morning is putting you under a direct prophecy that was spoken by a 20th century prophet this is dusty of the lord [Music] let me see if i could bring it to you this week when isaiah said the virgin shall conceive mary wasn't coming for 400 years after until later but 400 years so that was text until mary come on when mary came on the scene that is not just texts that the reason for long you know that the prophecy is at hand so when the angel wanted to connect mary with that scripture the angela peter marries a hail mary they were highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are that angel join from the scripture because the time has come to anoint this woman to produce messiah nothing could stop that and have a specific person to fulfill that her name is mary no other name is we're going to be fulfilling that but mary so when the time came the angel had to find mary call muriel say the lord is with me she don't even know that but you have to tell her the lord is with me blessed are those women oh glory to god oh man god call you out god call you to tell you that he is with you that he's going to bless you that he's going to deliver you that he's going to free you oh glory to god you have your past you have your failures you have your shortcomings but he's not looking at that he's looking at that name in that book oh glory to god and if your name is on that book you shall be delivered [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me this morning oh glory to god so god i'm watching your flesh and your spirit and your humanity and all your natural thing god nothing left he looking to see what's inside your soul what's inside your seed why could he say peter come andrew come it wasn't just any and anybody he said all that the father had given me shall come the father give them to him before they even knew he was given to him peter didn't know but he knew like we like to say the woman at the well she didn't know her name was on the book she had liver with one man she had five but jesus had to meet that woman because he was the book itself he knew what he knew her name was inside of there because he was the book itself jesus the way to find you jesus nowhere to get you he know what condition you were in this morning he know what you need to be delivered from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when was your name put on the book of life this name we talking about this name when you when you start to behave yourself and i started to behave nice i want you to think about that now i know it's wrong in light it's not so deep but i want you to think about that when was your name put on the last book of life when your backslide when he was fooling around no god put your name in the alarm book of life before the foundation of the world oh glory to god when he put it before the foundation of the world and satan was not there before the foundation of the world so he doesn't know the book he doesn't know your name but god knows your name and he calling you by name which is a manifestation of the word from the book so tonight today you could hear your name and the person next to you they're not hearing what god telling you that's you and god that's flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you but my father had to reveal it unto you oh give the lord a shout your husband can't stop you from hearing that voice your wife can't stop you from hearing that voice not your children not even your past because all we for you he called go give the lord a shout my god i don't care what you're in this morning i don't care if you just had a bottle of liquor last night you are going to be delivered if your name is on that book i don't give you a smoking ganja for the whole week today is your day praise god your gun your smoking days is over i don't care what you the devil had you trapped in he came to set the captain free that's the spirit of god come to do that oh give the lord a shout in the house oh how many leaves are going free this morning how many people are going free today oh hallelujah the lamb was slain when before the foundation of the world so when adam fell and that book that seven sealed book that deed that adam was to have to release and bring forth other sons it went back in the hands of the original owner so all these years it has been a battle for redemption restoration possession and inheritance all these years it has been a battle because god has caught the settle with that devil that throw mandon in the garden of eden on god purpose he purpose that lucifer will get the battle of his time with a bride in the last days he purposed that he gonna restore back another eden another people another people in the land under their messenger could be the final voice of the final age he promised that that could be a super racist a super church in the last days oh glory to god oh how many believe that this morning oh glory to god he promised it and asked you how you feel about jesus you may be seated i'm not asking you how you feel about it i am telling you what god promised when god tell abraham you are going to be a father of nations and abraham said a child god said communist social life should be i actually feel childless or not i ask if it's here i can have a child or not that's not the question i ask in you i am telling you that so shall your seed be and if i said so i will keep my word to you and any word god speak to you he has to keep it he is obligated to keep it he is guilty until he bring that word to pass i am the lord thy god thee of all thy diseases of all life sicknesses he is god this morning he's a waymaker this morning he still opened the red sea he still make a way in the wilderness so glory to god oh hallelujah glory to god this happened to you and that happened to you this other thing happened to you but do you know romans 8 28 do you know we know that all things work together for good you can make it work together for good but he does do that he does make all things to put together for good he raised up samsung to destroy them philistines and samson was defeated by a woman named delilah when god put the samson a blind for so much years it looked like he did look like he'd dry up it looked like all hopes gone but one day they decided to bring him out to make fun of him and god will never let the unbeliever make fun of this glorious bloodborne church of the living god glory to god hold dead and fill his tanks tried to back us up or give the lord i shall go but never let the enemy have rejoice over you okay the lord i shout for his name's sake for his name's sake you're gonna be free for not by you but for his namesake [Applause] [Music] oh glory so shout praise god for his name shake because he is worthy he worshipped [Applause] [Music] glory [Applause] when samson's ready and the little boy leading him he's blind his eyes is out and samson said avenge me in my eyes yeah wrong i failed a sin but he had no right to decode my eyes then some simply i pray once more you could only say once more when you once had it did you hear what i said you could only say once more when you once had it let's go back to what we once had we once had genesis 128 let us make man in our image in our likeness let that man have dominion over every creeping thing over every spirit dominion not conquered by spirits but conquering spirits dominion means all the control over dominating oh glory to god give the lord a shout we had that that's belong to sons [Music] that's what we had when we say once more we talking about going right back to genesis when god had the original intent for man to be endured power and jesus brought it back in acts 1 8 he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost comes upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me yes here will be weak there will be struggling there will be a fighting up christian that's not what the power is about he said power power to live power to overcome power to pray power to live right or power to do right or glory to god you shall you shall believe it oh glory to god i want you to believe it i want you to receive what is being spoken you shall receive power oh glory to god hallelujah go glory to god hallelujah my my my man so the battle has been for possession and inheritance and redemption devil not interested in that he interested you staying as you are he don't want to be a redeemed son a redeemed son is a restored son and restored son is a dangerous person in satan's eating satan can handle a restore son look at elijah elijah said not even jew or rain will fall till i call for it that man shook the heavens up you hear what i said that's when shut the heavens up joshua says son stand still moon oh glory to god that that sun set things in order and hold the moon right there because you have some demons to finish off because i don't want to face them demons next day i want to finish them off today oh gloria we have some devils here we want to finish off today this is the service this is the time oh give the lord a shout you're going free you may as well shout and rejoice you know [Applause] when let me be seated when samson say one small lord one small lord all the angels in heaven come long upon him with an anointing of strength and power and when something's not to throw down them things there he slew more than philistines that is dead than in his life he killed him out why because a son placed positionally a position of power that he could fulfill the purpose of god destroy the enemy you hope you are raised up to destroy the enemies [Applause] so you are sitting all them demons are wrong your life drinking smoking whatever it is yeah that's normal because you're a sinner they are wrong you know you're coming god's army go come and get your boots guns weapons knives sword shield not for you just jump with the enemy but to fight them devils to fight them demons not to accept your sickness i don't care if you're 90 and nine god could heal you hallelujah which person look at the dead i think you're all there nobody looking at it yet i woke up looking forward to dead nobody talks like that nobody talk anybody want to live and you have a right to want to live jesus said i come that you might have life not exist live not survive live god over here survive and live live the abundant life live [Music] [Applause] [Music] so when man fell blood of bulls and goats was accepted as a substitute but then god was waiting for the lamb to come because only one blood was untruely accepted which is the blood of jesus christ which is the blood of god it wasn't the blood of a man it was not jewish blood i israelite blood was the blood of god that's why your voice not to conceive so what god put egg and sperm to produce the body called jesus so when he died was the blood of god and the blood released the spirit life but that blood was to answer the same question because the devil could hold us captive as long as we covered with sin but the blood was to answer the same question because sin had to be dealt with said not to be judged and the penalty of sin was death so that was required anybody to come to kingsman redeemer had to pay the price of debt and to be a kinsmen redeemer you have to be willing you have to be rich you have to be connected with man so jesus met the qualification to be the kinsman redeemer he was willing he was rich he was connected to us as a man because no angel could redeem us a man had to redeem us a worthy man a worthy kinsman so when he stepped forward to take the book when he stepped forward to die on the cross was to answer the same question once and for all oh give the lord a shout [Applause] you may be seated this same question was answered 24 7. [Music] this was not temporary and say you know this was the answer to sin 24 7. i die for them satan say they did this he did this she did this but i die look my blood is almost like if you pay in advance so have a course look at here blood blood blood blood seven ages seven drops of blood seven mercy seats what glory every age the blood speaking on behalf [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god we are only here this morning because of blood not because we're good because of blood not because we try to do better but because of blood there is none righteous none none none no not one no pope righteous no pastor righteous no testimony righteous as one righteous that is jesus christ and when his blood apply to your heart to your mind to your spirit and your spirit hallelujah receive a spirit then you are covered by the blood and you god doesn't see you he sees the blood he doesn't even hear your voice you see the voice of the blood speaking on your behalf he sees you perfect he sees you healed he see you delivered he see you free he see you hallelujah the chains are wrong you're being busted and broken [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the connection to god the connection to god was broken sim card stop working no dial tone bill not paid you can't get a car to buy hallelujah you can't receive calls in the comments no call but when jesus died new sim card hallelujah phone bill paid hallelujah your post paid the wallet everything paid up already you just have to make your calls any time if my people that are called by my name oh glory to god shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then you're gonna hear from heaven then i'm gonna heal your land so you could call them any time when the devil have your battered in the corner your ball oh god an angel waiting to take down your request gorgeous ball oh god what you want what you want what you want deliverance you want your healing you want your eyes open you want to you be set free what do you want then ask what you will shall be given unto you oh glory to god oh god waiting on his children to call upon him oh glory to god greatest weapon god could give you is that weapon to call upon him in prayer and i was striking my show that there's a place where he could meet you i will meet you in there there's a place he could meet you he could meet you in a place oh glory to god nobody could take that place from you oh glory to god amen the connection to god was broken by sin relationship was broken fellowship was broken men's hope was lost but he promised a messiah a redeemer he promised all to the old testament to lead the church to bring man back to his rightful possession oh glory to god i want you to get that not leave the church lead you to the your rightful possession oh my do you believe that oh praise the name of the lord so he breaks the seals and reveals his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming the kinsmen redeemer he freely give it out to us it belonged to him he is the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it for himself he gives it back to it the people that's his love for us he took the book isn't that right he took the book and what happened he came down give it to the prophet and then the angels they go and take the book and eat the book a book that they couldn't look upon a book that they couldn't touch no you could eat the book that book belongs to us it's the book of god it's the book of prophecy so we could receive that book and take that book and prophesy your deliverance this morning and the god is here to enforce that word of prophecy over your life a complete healing what the doctors give up on you oh glory to god don't you give up on yourself now don't you give up on god don't do that now oh glory to god if doctor gave you 24 hours to live don't you give up oh believe god anyone he could heal you he could redeem you he could deliver you glory to god so satan is the squatter but you don't want to give it up right quick satan here all the time do you think he'll just give you objection after pharaoh said take your people and go and they're going out when theo sit down and think it over he said god whatever nations will think about me this god that i don't know delivered these people out of my hands he can't tell the nation about the plagues and the frogs on the flights that you get them all the nation's seen people giving out oh god like he lost his power like he's a cool he looked like the big fear of egypt which was the supreme power that time he got overthrown fear can handle that he said no no i can't handle that boy let me go back after them so anytime you see freedom coming that devil had to take over you know because after you get licks like that you have to let you go but when he didn't get over how he could look i hadn't kept it for so long then he coming back after you have to prove and show you're delivered and you will stay delivered you're going to accept the deliverance and tell that devil not anymore you heard me before but not now not anymore i am free i am free i am free [Applause] oh glory to god brother branham he said only satan is a squatter he don't legally own this he had two thousand years to fuss whether he wants it or not but somebody else owned it christ came as the kingman redeemer and redeem it back to us but satan satan possessed it and you know after a while this great fight is over he'll be cast into a lake of fire and he'll be done away with on those who worship with him a man lost his inheritance a squatter come on his land he could not hold it longer than 50 years and after 50 years there comes a jubilee so when you see you're going in poverty and you lost this and you lost that somebody could only hold your land in bible days under the law only for 50 years and after 50 years they have to walk out they have to give up so after 50 years god pronounced a jubilee that you could go back to your inheritance you could go back as if nothing happened that person have to give it up that's just the law of god and i am declaring this morning that there's going to be another year of jubilee that the devil have to give up get up get out glory to god you're going back to your first love back to your joy back to the holy ghost back to revival back to breakthrough back to deliverance you are going back to that that's yours back to your sonship back to your godship back to inheritance back to what peter had back to the faith of the fathers that's what jubilee is about oh glory to god back to dynamics in the mechanics glory under here jubilee let's go they have jubilee come along and everything went back to its original beginning all the slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was holding in the field and the trumpet sung and he heard it he could throw down the whole and say i am no more a slave i am going back to my family everything was given back all glory to god because the legal owner was coming back so we had a leak illegal you didn't hear that we are the legal owners satan is a squatter that's why we can push him back anytime because man fell he can inflict with sickness and disease but we have a right to cast it out we have the legal authority by the word in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover oh give the lord our praise oh glory to god that's not that's not hoping so that's that we telling ourselves be positive let's not be positive that's not that they're not that be positive you know you're the thing everything positive everything healthy that's not that you know that is jesus and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name oh glory not in their name in my name they're gonna cast out devils oh glory devils of sicknesses and demon activity praise god affected in your spirit your body your mind and your soul devils have to go so we can afford this morning to serve notice on every devil inside of here satan time up oh glory to god you can go free if you want to go free choice is yours he's not forcing you you have the choice to make if you want to go free hallelujah oh my hallelujah so jesus hallelujah let's continue now on the 50th day after he died the fifth day was what did he have pentecost and the legal owner came down and showed it was no organization it was the filling of the holy ghost that was god's earnest to this church that it would not be controlled by organization it had to be controlled by the power and the love of god so the holy ghost under pentecost proof is not a church thing it's not a bishop thing it's not you have to go down their thing it has to be a god thing because when the pillar of fire came it divided itself and everybody got their portion including mary magdalene including mary mother of jesus including peter and all of them brothers inside of there everybody get the liquor fire nobody lighting from somebody else own they have their own liquor fire they have their own powerhouse they have their own anointing oh glory to god they had to go to some church for it them sisters had it the brothers had it the deacons had it the preachers had it all man jack had it and everybody gonna get it lord do you believe that man i feel the power of god in the building this morning god you're going to get what god promised you no devil could stop you from getting it not even your past could stop you from getting it go go fill you with the holy ghost take that devil god go deliver you take that devil no devil can't stop your deliverance you come for deliverance oh hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hello let me finish up here hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god praise god but the brown and brethren not to hurt your feelings if the organization is right and you're just a catholic by organization you're baptised by organization you're lost the earnings of your salvation was not joining the church the earnest of your salvation is not belonging to an organization the earnest of your salvation is the baptism of the holy ghost without organization then you standing for god they could put you in china they could put you in russia it doesn't matter where they put you because when god put that inside of you he could put you in the lion's den lion can bite you he could put in a ferrari furnace fire burn here come on now preach back to me someday in the pentecostal age when the system was in the spirit they're shooting guns at them and the bullet was falling off their clothes bullet oh glory to god hallelujah you talk about the super church coming you see nothing yet man my god i can't wait but it's just i'm excited about this you know my god we see power yet oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god that's all my testimony brothers who car's not even working you can't stop working i didn't know what wrong with it and they lay hands at the bone and say lord god do something on saturday's god when they go back can't start normal normal normal can't figure out them kind of things them there was just pure faith you know i know a man my lord no one has no spare tire they tire on the car smooth like pawns face you lay hands and you pray for the car pray for the tire and you're making it home and it's a big testimony oh those were the days man but more things coming you know missing limbs will be restored more things coming you know you talk about power you don't want spoken with power people will be delivered without hands being laid upon them you're telling the blind see selling the death here telling them speak and they're going to speak because the word is spoken oh glory to god the same god that said let there be light will be saying speak cancer dissolve in the name of jesus dissolve all glory of human fall over people cancer falling off of people all glory to quickening power quickness power quickness power oh glory to god halal you know what equipment power is it quickens you you can't sit there dead with picton power on you [Applause] that god when lazarus came out and then exactly preached he called him grave clothes so lazarus come up still tie up he come out jumping so he tap it grave clothes say he come also holy man dead and he said yeah move anybody still dead but lazarus is alive so here loose yet but yeah grave clothes tie up wrong him see come on say come on who is that my god if you're afraid you're running like a zombie coming or something was lazarus coming over the great clothes then i said lose him lose him and i'm telling you coming out this morning you coming out this morning you are coming on this morning guess i said lose him and let him go oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah so let's nail on this prophecy right now they could not hold it past that 50th day because that was a day of jubilee when everything went back to the original beginning do you understand what jubilee means going back to the original the original man the original power the original church the original fate going back to the original the back to the bible okay and the power of god was taken back to its original the 50th day the year of jubilee when all things went back now you're the prophecy there will come another year of jubilee [Music] [Applause] some of you can get that that's why you shout another one you know what that means you're going back anywhere you know think about you lost your house you lost your family you lost your children the devil had them captive and you're going back to another jubilee then you could see your children coming back all them were in drugs all them who's smoking all them in all kind of condition and they're all all about and you see in their deliverance and you wouldn't rejoice now it wouldn't be your might it wouldn't be your power it will be by the spirit of god it will be by the grace of god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i'll just jump over there will come another year of jubilee so that's my prophecy to you a time of jubilee a time of release a time of going back amidst the time of judgment because the day of vengeance had to be declared what happened there's a lot when jesus said i wouldn't there's a lot what happened there he always sent angels to get him out it was a jubilee to them and escape out get him out all together listen they had a choice to stay or get out the angel said come out but don't look back hallelujah away was me because judgment was about fixed and set and god will not let the righteous perish with the wicked and god righteousness is not what you count as righteousness god rushes when he put your name on that book he sees you as righteous seed glory to god you are the seed of the righteous it's not you are the believer the word in you is the believer [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see that's why god could call prostitutes and drunkards and humongous and people can understand that how goku called he i know he yes he she i know she she was terrible yes god called sister terrible and brother mean and brother don't smile and sister hard face ancestor kia cook he calls this the who could cook and says cookies start to learn to cook i didn't i didn't come in for that but i wanted me to show them is that god calling all types and you cannot tell god who to call and who not the call as long as he called you and you saw your name on the book you could shout anyhow you can start to shout in advance you can start to praise god in advance because god will deliver you god will free you go go free your family to you know i know we say now for years i know some of you don't even believe that but that i could change that your family will be delivered i see them delivered i see them coming inside the building that's why you're preaching this way i preach an evil to your unbelief i still preach in this because i know it's not dependent upon you if you remember what god said every name on that book at that time michael shall stand up oh glory to god michael the prince michael the archangel or chloe the god and stand up and deliver every one of them then bong wants to them paxton wants to they're coming out we serving the devil notice they're coming out they have to come out oh glory to god with me your words and your thoughts and your ideas is god hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord you won't be seated when they called jesus daughter was sick unto death then somebody come and tell them and go whatever jesus she's dead he said go wake her. i said two different things there now one man saying she is dead and she was dead according to death that they think but they can jesus vision as far as he can

wake up he wake up they're sleeping oh glory to god he called us sleeping a dead girl was woke up because he's here sleeping so the saints are going on the dead they're not dead they're only sleeping but i'm not dead he's sleeping he's sleeping another dimension right here all your loved ones going on there's another mention right here we can pick up the crystal to find out and see what they're

him better god get your new shoes make sure you're shouting that shoes go go and pause in the mall with your new shoes bring your new shoes here jump on it break the heel if you have to or give the

[Applause] when you begin to see the air of jubilee aha so you're given a fine-tuned by the clearance of this jubilee you know when you begin to see the ear of jubilee where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this so they have jubilee no fussing no straining no pulling you're walking and you're worshiping you're walking in your atmosphere you're walking and heaven is around you because heaven consists of the word and the word is in you [Music] word is heaven is around you you're walking to your house and demons scattering before you reach the door you're visiting your family and as you open the door so demons start to scamper because an anointed sun a jubilee son redeemer son they're coming to redeem your fallen family oh you're coming like a mini jesus like a small messiah but around the messiah act a mini one a small version of the one the big one when you walk in the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me your families sit there in bed but you know you're coming to pray for them the anointing all over you they're noting upon your hands the faith is inside your heart oh glory to when they have lands upon them so you know it's more than the sick being healed you know their soul will be delivered oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah when you see this begin to hear the year of jubilee where you don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we already secured in christ satan can't hold you amen this is our gentile workers because god is releasing his spirit by his grace gideon wants some religion come here because we want to switch but as i want to share something with you but listen there's barramundi talk about total deliverance he said i heard brother neville along this morning back there kind of come to my mind the people are seriously getting away from deliverance it seems to be something that the people seem so they push it to the other side well god can do it but that's not the attitude moses when he was called by god he was total complete prophet and when god sends a man to do anything he completely equip him and puts what he has needed of if god comes man to be a preacher he put him something to preach and that's what he's done he sent moses to egypt and equipped him just like you if you're a christian god will make half a christians god make complete christians god will make halfway preachers but preachers can be half free and god makes his children christian but sometimes they're half the christians it's not god's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways they got mixed up with the plan of god for their life and that's what makes them that way god will make halfway preachers or halfway christians but he said moses was completely surrendered into the hands of god and that's the reason god could completely trust him i wonder this morning as christians if we have healed our own will yield ourselves so completely to god that god can trust us to a place that he put us i won this morning myself if i could be so hero to god till god could trust me could trust but i never could trust the trustee board leaking board the minister's got a place to duty to preach the gospel and a member of the church if he's going to be a member of this certain group he should not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble that member should never touch a deck of cards if we believe in drinking he should turn his head completely from drinking if we believe not do not believe in gambling or smoking and he's not supposed to be in that at all and if we completely deliver ourselves into his hand then god can live in us christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us and we get ourselves out of the way then our thoughts are his thoughts could imagine christ smoking a cigar could you imagine christ praying at cards if then if your spirit is part of his spirit he wants you to be upon your confession and you permit the devil come in and take over if our hearts condemn us we we want complete deliverance we don't want a halfway church we want to be a real church or no church at all we want to be real christians or no christians at all we want total deliverance from our habits from our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence whatever we have done we want a total deliverance so that when people come into this church to be prayed for they'll be literal this little group maybe not over a hundred or two sitting here they'll be completely in the hands of god and when we are unified praise god in our hearts together with brotherly love obey the officer of the church and the pastor the pastor obey god then god works through the pastor to the board talking to the church and we're all together one unit for the kingdom of god and pharaoh pharaoh moses you can go but leave your children behind that's the way the devil wants a christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't ever forgive jones they'll be all right you don't have to give up you're smoking or drinking or lying or stealing you'll fall fine and back fighting you gotta give that up just join the church but moses wasn't compromised he wanted a complete deliverance he said we will not leave one hoof behind we will take everything that belongs to us then we go to worship god we will take righteousness we will take holiness we will take purity we will take all what god require that's when one night when god ordained that lamb should be killed type of christ and the blood was dipped and he said when i see the blood you had to put a doorpost on the doorpost you had to put the blood on a place where it must be displayed you cannot be a private believer you cannot be a private christian christians is a public thing you have to have the blood displayed upon your chest upon your heart upon your life and when the church shall be completely delivered when everything is brought under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking you're gambling you're cheating when you're stealing your line when everything is brought under the blood there'll be a total deliverance if you have wrong somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't steal you can't bring it something won't let you do it when yourself is completely totally brought under the blood there'll be a total deliverance and you'll have a freedom here we go you'll have a freedom like you have never known before when everything is brought under the blood brought and submissive to the kingdom of god there'll be a real deliverance and then he was saying praying dear god you don't think you don't take things unless it's totally delivered you cannot receive a sacrifice with blemish on it you would never receive a prayer with sin back in the life of that person you could not do it lord you didn't do it in the ages gone by you can't do it but the sacrifice must be without blemish oh my hallelujah do you believe that praise god praise god want you to prosper and be in good health he said don't stop for nothing you got the message jesus lives god is a healer that's the message what was it the word that he walked with was within him build him up there in his flesh and in his soul yet a little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me the spirit quickens the word in other words he is the powder that sends the bullets out there oh my oh praise be to jesus don't stop for nothing no reason nothing else god is training this great battle matthew 24 said here please something so forgive me hallelujah rest even oh praise god there will be a time of trouble such as there was before are we living in that time when culture and education and things have smuggled over the word of

that mind there is a battleground oh harley let's all stand just watch it a little bit [Music] glory [Music] listen to the prophet i've seen it so many times when you see the spirit of god strike a place and that place gets on the anointing if this little group in here this morning could just take this mind here get every doubt out of the way you can move dope you can't dog anymore and then you will see the dead raised up the lame walk the blind sea the death here oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah let's all worship the lord right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] worship

church amen it's such a powerful thing to worship such a powerful thing to praise god oh he inhabits the praises of his people and just to think in this as we go into this easter week you know today's when we remember that palm sunday when everybody was shouting hosanna hosanna hosanna oh blessed is he who comes huh is that your worship is that do you have your your your hosanna in your lips and your heart and your is he your everything is he your all and all is he your source is he your strength is he your joy is he your life is he your peace is he of victory is he your sustenance is he your shield is he your reward is he a buckler oh he is your bread he's your waymaker oh can we just give him our hand our praise oh blessed be the name of the lord how we thank him for his grace in his mercy so we do have a note of praise and some prayer requests before we get into the end the announcement so but antoine is giving god praise for he and his wife reaching 56 years of marriage a milestone happy anniversary but antoine 56 years of marriage my mama what a testimony he's also requesting prayer for the improved health of sister and wine and we have some requests this morning [Music] a number of serious requests so be reverent uh first request from the michael thompson good morning scenes i'm requesting prayer for one of my neighbors who has been having excruciating headaches all tests done uh since but the conversation with the wife have not revealed a problem trusting god for healing and a total deliverance his name is robin tanaki and from sister vivienne the jew good morning saints i'm requesting prayer for ganga hari prasad who is suffering with colon cancer and sister judy lamorel is here this morning with a desperate cry for her son who is presently in the hospital in a coma so we want to go to the throne of grace with these requests and before we praise any requests this morning you want to show by raise of hands as we stand in the presence of the lord maybe you don't get to write it but you have a need that you came in here this morning with a need that may have been expressed or maybe unexpressed but you know our god is more than able this morning to break chains and break shackles and to restore to deliver and to beloved was preaching about these demonic forces and demons in the physical realm and in the spiritual realm but this morning in this anointing and after the world has gone forth we have confidence and assurance to approach the throne of god and know that we could ask anything in my name and he promised to do it and if two shall agree touching anything we could ask and see it come to pass this morning can we bow our heads to a word of prayer or gracious heavenly father the word has gone forth and the word is sharper than any to its sword cut through the bone and the marrow cut through situations and circumstances that we cannot explain or we try to understand but lord your word is able to find a way to us find a way into situations when the doctors have given up and when lawyers have given up and when friends and family have given up the word that is followed by the spirit is able to breach and bridge the gap and bring relief and bring comfort and lord father we come this morning lord with the blessed assurance that you are a healer you are a waymaker you are a restorer you are deliverer and lord even when you walk the earth lord you said lord is anything too hard for the lord lord so we know that there's no hard cases there's no situation that you cannot resolve there are no problems that you cannot solve lord we acknowledge you as our lord we acknowledge you as our king we acknowledge you as our master and we acknowledge you as healer this morning lord we want to bring these requests before you father lord firstly for robin tanaki the they don't know what is going on but father you know exactly what is going on so we pray dear god that the angel of the lord will visit him where he is and touch him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet may he not only be healed but may he come to know you by revelation and by experience and made this request turn back as a note of praise father lord you want to remember sister entwined father looking for healing in her body and improve health lord as brother said in the service you can be 99 years old you still have a promise of healing so father may you heal your daughter even now and touch her from the crown of her head to the souls of our feet father may you give strength into her body in the name of jesus christ and father from sister vivian for ganga hair represent with the colon cancer that demon of cancer we come against it in the mighty name of jesus christ father may you minister and may you touch him from the crown of his head to the sword of your feet and may you lord bring healing in the name of jesus christ and now lord we come united as a church in faith for our sister judy who's here in the tabernacle lord she has not let anything keep her away from your presence but she has come with a desperate cry a desperate plea a desperate need with sincerity in her heart looking for a miracle lord for her son who's in the hospital even now in a coma lord god we pray there god that the angel of the lord would be dispatched to where he is right now may the angel walk into that room walk past the security walk past the doctors and the nurses walk up to that hospital bed and may the angel of the lord touch him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet lord you know what the doctors don't know but father may you bring healing may you bring deliverance may you raise him up may this request become another praise in the mighty name of jesus christ we unite in faith we unite on the promise of your word lord that you are the god that heals and lord for so many hands that were raised lord i lift my hand also in this presence in this sanctuary we are needy people lord we pray there god for your church lord your church that's in this sanctuary those that are downstairs those that are on the internet lot so many needs so many situations so many conditions a lot too many to write but you are more unable to take them all you are more than able to deal with them all lord we come to you this morning and lay our lives at your throne we lay our lives at your feet we are at your mercy and we come for mercy we come for a blessing we come from favor for healing for our families for deliverance for our situations for our touching our bodies for the baptism of the holy ghost for restoration of our walk with you our talk with you for a revival in our soul for our restoration of that which we lost lord for financial breakthrough for marital breakthrough for family breakthrough for situations god in the name of jesus christ hear the cries of your people hear the needs of your people here to please of your people there's a bomb in gilead and lord we want to touch that palm in the name of jesus christ lord and may you bless your church lord may you bless the upcoming convention lord this weekend lord may the holy ghost pour out lord all over the world in our homes lord in our jobs in the tabernacle wherever people may be at when they connected a service loan mayor a rushing might you win fill cars fill homes feel tabernacled low may your people get a hold of that angel

and anointed lord made your holy spirit use the efforts of lord your prophet said they got to do something for someone to happen you got to throw up a rock for something to happen so father we drop a rock in this service oh god we do something lord we give you praise we say father let the fire fall we say pour out your holy spirit we say break chains and break shackles and break barriers and in the name of jesus christ may you bring us back at the appointed time in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says a many many men you may be seated in the presence of the lord for a few announcements we have a number of announcements so i want to try to just make sure i get them all so firstly uh we have two special announcements sister precious alan god bless you would you stand god bless you she'd like to make hezen tabernacle home church god bless you may god bless you richly as you'll be a part of this fellowship he's been here for quite a number of months and has been faithful and is looking for more from god and she has a revelation that she wants this to be her home so we appreciate that by the grace of god and also sister susan donna bless you understand god bless you suzanne we want to welcome sister suzanne back into the fellowship and she also want to you know make this her home as well she has not been here for some time but the lord spoke to her heart and she is back in fellowship looking for god to do something not just for her but for her family and we pray dear god that god would reward her fate and reward her efforts in this season as we are coming to the finish line and we see the final seconds counting down as we blend from time into eternity friends it's not going to be too much longer hallelujah this is not all in vain you know it's not just coming to church and coming to church but we are leaving this place and before we leave this place we're going to have a salt in our lips a praise in our hearts of victory and you're going to leave knowing that you put your foot on the neck of the devil every demon every spirit every ungodly spirit that ever tried to come against you you will have the victory as brother over preached when samson stood there he said avenge me of my two eyes i messed up i made mistakes and and i fell but the devil had no right to take my eyes the devil had no right to touch my body the devil had no right to touch my family the devil had no right to come against me and because he mexed with the wrong one when there's a power that's coming into the church now to bring us into a position of power positionally placed adoption to speak not just for your family but for your situation as well so may the lord bless them in a special way uh brother jaden good to see you in the house of the lord the devil is on the attack you know trying to pull break up families break up young people hallelujah i think was the prophet what said they say if i lose my teeth he told me if i lose my teeth i'll gum the devil i don't care how broken your wing is this morning you're still an eagle god is able to restore the strength he renews the strength of the eagle so i want to encourage you keep on pressing keep on fighting the road is not designed to be easy but you're built to handle the road may god richie bless you this morning so just a few announcements quickly so as brother thompson would have spoken to the church uh last sunday we uh embarked once again with some various fundraising activities in preparation for a number of things that we have to do both with respect to the building and certain requirements as well as our plans coming soon for as things are opening up get you ready for conventions in whatever way that would unfold so we want to encourage your support in whatever way you can uh we are living in a in a different kind of time we see so many things happening in different realms in the political realm in the economic realm just coming up right ahead of us gas prices going to go up and all these kind of things happening but the reality is we can be tied down to this natural because we are leaving this place we are we have to leave this place we have to do whatever we can do to leave this place so i encourage you and uh in that effort as well as uh thompson mentioned um the uh the hospitality team um is once again they have some items after service so you can be refreshed um that will be part of this process of helping raise funds so we encourage your support of that in a special way you'll find them right outside the tabernacle on the western side of the tabernacle in addition after service the sunday school members of the sun school are required to meet with a sunday school team after service just after service so as you know this week is our convention week it's easter week is a special time and as a result of the convention this coming weekend um there will be no bible study this tuesday there will be no service on wednesday but we have seven services that will be the easter convention starting on thursday at 1 pm so there will be one service on thursday at 1 pm and then on friday saturday and sunday there will be two services each of those days at 8 00 am and 1 pm so once again there's one service on thursday at 1 p.m and friday saturday sunday services at 8 a.m and 1 p.m we encourage you to make sure and connect for the services on thursday friday and saturday we want you to connect from your homes and fellowship via the the connection but this coming sunday it is easter sunday and as a believer that's an important marking uh line for us as believers so we want the church to come out on sunday for both services eight am and one pm uh that's that declaration he is risen every sunday every time the sun raises it arises it's a testament that he has risen but as a believer isa sunday is is critical so we really want to encourage the church to make it out for both services this coming sunday 8 a.m and uh 1 p.m and uh just to reemphasize the tabernacle will not be open on thursday friday or saturday we will be streaming it around the world certainly when on sunday for the 8 a.m service and 1 pm service we want to be here and worshiping in the presence of the lord and and in that same vein the you have the option of course to walk with a meal but there's also uh an alternative uh provided from brother thompson of a special uh brunch package that will be available between the services on easter sunday and uh try to keep it as simple as possible they are basically two options you could have uh there's a breakfast option and there's a lunch option or you could have them both so i just want to bring you up to speed on what's available for you um if you choose to take advantage of these options so there are two menus one for the adults and one for the children under 10 years old for the adults there's a breakfast menu which will be mini bakes with salt fish boujole rolls with

or fresh creole with caramelized onion sauce pigeon peas rice pilaf cinnamon plantains and sauce sauteed vegetable medley for fifty dollars so you can take one or the other or you can have both and if you choose to take both you get a special price as a bundle for the breakfast and the lunch and that will be still between uh that morning and evening service uh this easter sunday and it's forty dollars for the breakfast fifty dollars for the lunch and if you take the combo it's eighty-five dollars uh sister bernadette and sister crystal currently will be downstairs taking your names if you
