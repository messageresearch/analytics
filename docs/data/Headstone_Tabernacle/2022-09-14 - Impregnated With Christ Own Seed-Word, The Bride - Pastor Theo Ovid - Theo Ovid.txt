thank you for guiding us together in this last day we are actually in the last days so many years have been rolling by that you're looking for this perfect bride this bride that you love this pride that you long for this barriers you were waiting for to be made manifest in satan's eden here we are lord sinners that you have called by your grease and you've put faith in our souls to believe the truth of your word we thank you that we are not under a delusion or an illusion lord delusion is when people believe things that that not real and when they are challenged by the facts of things they still believe what they believe but we believe the truth of the word we don't believe conan divine fables we don't believe stories we believe thus see at the lord are we hold on to it with our lives father we know this word can't fail because he said heaven will pass away but this word will never pass away father i pray tonight everyone that's here that you minister to them in a special way meet their every need those are connected life father god may you minister and bless them do that but hear the tape later on may the anointing sweep into their homes in their hearts in their lives may the sick be healed lord may lie souls be delivered and set free may you spoil the works of darkness and run the enemy out of the camp in the hearts and lives of your children in jesus might ask it amen god bless you the prayer requests and announcements we take after service and also the immense announcement so if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to three ports of scripture tonight god bless you brothers musicians certainly appreciate all of you out here tonight uh luke chapter eight we wanna read from verse four to fifteen luke chapter 17 we want to read from 26 to 30. and matthew 13 only read one verse there verse 37 praise the lord reading from luke 8 jesus speaks and when much people were gathered together and will come to him out of every city he speak by a parable a soul went out to sow his seed as he sold some fell by the wayside it was trotted down the falls of the egg devoured it some fell up on a rock soon as sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some fell among torns and the torn sprung up and bit it and choked it others fell on good ground sprung up and bear fruit a hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he done ears to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this problem be he said he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto the others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god those by the way sign are they that hear then commit the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts at least they should believe and be saved then day on the rock a day which when they hear receive the word with joy but these have no root which for a while believe the time of temptation fall away and that which fell among tones are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection note those words don't bring no fruit to perfection 15 but but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience okay and we've switched to luke 17 reading from verse 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also i was in the of a lot days of luck they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went under sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed or final scriptures from matthew chapter 13 verse 37 he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man heavenly father we thank you bless your word and interpret your hearts tonight in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated praise god god bless you and welcome so tonight our title impregnated with christ's own seed the bride that's the title tonight impregnated with christ's own seed the bride and the seed is the bible oh let's go let's see what the lord will do for us tonight he said no national force he said like israel back in the promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in a place we know the the six million jews were killed that drove them back to the promised land to hitler and eichmann and stalin and all these guys anointed with heavy spirits upon them is not right a force did that now i'm going to say something national force but israel in a homeland national force will pull the church in the work of the churches so it will be a forcing but the power of god will put the people in the bride no man can no pastor apostle prophet evangelist man could put the people in the bride the only thing that could put the people in the bride is the power of god now you have to believe this just as it is spoken no pastor man evangelist man teacher man prophet man apostle man putting anybody in the bride you could shake those people's hands but they can't put you in the brain it will take the power of god that power of man power of god and the power of god man don't control that are you with me tonight man don't control the power of god the power of god will put you in the bride isn't that right all right let's go watch the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god i like how it is placed so he's not just saying the word he's in the spirit and what spirit is that which is the word because he said my words are spirit and life so the spirit of god which is the word of god my word in spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she will recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force will drive eligible homeland national force work on the churches would drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bright into glory oh blessed be the name of the lord now he promised to send you heavenly light to write in the word seed that would be sown for this day or you mean a seed have to be sown for this day exactly right and the seed is here i'm reading the seed is the bible so you see why the devil don't want people to connect with the bible because the seed is the bible once you said that connect with the word the devil in trouble because the word have the power in it the seed is the bible why jesus said so the word is the seed that the sower sowed now here we go before you can have any crop no matter if you sow the seed it's got to have light to righten the seed or it will rot and won't do no good it will perish and if it's got seed in the ground the right ground with the right kind of sunlight it's got to ripen and he promised in the last days in the evening time the sun would come out to ripen that seed the seed is being preached so if you miss the preaching you miss the seed so the revelation is defined what seeds to sow so we are not here to preach tribulation to you that's not weird that's not your destination we are here to preach bridal promises to you because the rapture is your destination you want somebody saying you know the seed is preached the son of god is ripening that seed by vindicating it and making it push out before you proven it's right do you get it so who is the soul of the seed the son of man but who ripens the seed son of god oh give the lord some praises praise god so the son of man is the sower of the seed but the righteous of the seed is the son of god which is holy spirit he just whitened the seed oh glory to god said jessica have son of man alone you have to have son of god too which is the holy spirit to ripen the seed that son of man show or give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god amen now jesus is the word of god and he was bursted open that life the life is the inside of the seed and this life here we go which is spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seed of god will bring forth the life of the seed oh here the purpose jesus died so this bring a higher revelation than jesus pay the price for me and by his cross i'm safe and so on listen to this and it brings forth something else what do you understand if the spirit of god comes forth to water the seed if it's the seed it's watering it will produce the life of the seed now i believe the bible is the word the whole truth and jesus is the word made manifest he and his word is one and the same now he was the seed that eve should have produced it's a big one jesus was the seed that eve was supposed to produce you get it he was the sea that he was to produce but she hybrid it by disbelieving god's word so he was the seed and the only way that life could be reproduction in life have to come through that seed that seed had to die here we go in order to spread out the life that's why the water was given to water the seed the holy spirit was in the garden of eden was the water the seed man wasn't made to die he was made to live but high breeding brought debt she hybrided he said there's a germ of life come from the real seed of god prove it was a seed that through that life that was going the original seed was given to eve his real church is bringing forth life again through the birth to the womb of his bride oh glory to god hallelujah so the bride will have living waters and through the bride praise god through monk zion oh glory to god bring forth life again another eve a second evil a second woman to reproduce the original grain the original life oh glory to god hallelujah praise god do you believe that oh glory to god says rich and glorious watch this now he is that seed that was produced by the word of god now jesus is the word we manifest he and the word is one and the same and why it was made manifest in him so perfectly and that's the reason that god manifested himself so perfectly in jesus because he was the seed wood he was what salted again seed word or he said the germ word itself he was the germ that was inside the seed that's the life of the seed hallelujah get it and the germ word of god the germ is the spirit i'm still reading the germ is the water so he was the spirit water word seed word original word if the devil only knew who jesus was oh god because through that seed word that water going to be released is how we are here tonight because the water release is what the spirit is released to find you it's hell on the earth there is no way you could escape these demons there is no way you could escape hell on the earth except a third pearl except a spirit of god come and bust you the demons bust you there the prince of the power of the air bust you all those dimensions define you praise god that's the only way you and yourself cannot pull yourself up a power have to release oh glory to god when hell came on the earth heaven came down god sent seven angels from eternity to bring heaven down on the earth that's why he sent this message this is a glorious message oh glory to god angels looking into this oh hallelujah therefore you have to be a glorious people you have to be kings and priests that god has elected elected call out hallelujah i think this word reading again he was the seed word the germ wood the germ that was inside the seed that's the life in the seed so jesus and that's why the bible says the virgin shall conceive god is very specific and detailed to identify this man that is coming is not born of a woman here born by sex he born by spoken word mary said be it done unto me according to thy word she received the word and then you're going to find out what mary did oh glory to god without any evidence of pregnancy without any evidence and any sign anything like that she could say i'm gonna have a baby oh glory to god because he asked one question how shall this be this is like an impossible and all the angels said the holy ghost shall come upon you the holy ghost the holy ghost oh shall this be the holy ghost how this bragg will be a super race the holy ghost all this guy could do the same works he did the holy ghost all that guy why we adopted the same holy ghost praise god it is the holy ghost it was one the holy ghost people don't want the holy ghost the devil has nothing to do with the holy ghost but we won the holy ghost tonight we're going to have the holy ghost tonight we are crying for the holy ghost tonight the holy ghost is the life the holy ghost is the power the holy ghost is the brain the holy ghost is the anointed the holy ghost is the fire the holy ghost says wow the shirt started the holy ghost was in the upper room oh glory to god hallelujah praise god and eternal life is the holy ghost itself oh glory is not your own life your own life dies and your holy ghost life takes over we'll give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah here we go you wanna be seated jesus had to be broken open there in order for the seed to set forth its life the water of the seed that was coming oh glory to god you were always coming when he was in a mother's womb he was coming when he was in your grandfather's loins you were coming he was always waiting for you the devil is a liar tonight don't let the devil bang your head with a bunch of negative stuff praise god you know afterwards you know after taught you almost was aborted forget that the devil is a liar he was always coming he sent the holy spirit to water the seeds that was coming oh glory to god no rapture without us oh glory to god hallelujah get me excited tonight hallelujah praise god praise god you may be seated oh glory to god luther died wesley died pentecostal dialed all them heroes of it died and they leave the rest for us day without us not made perfect god i will reserve something better for us we are blessed we are privileged we are honored to be in the last days oh glory to god having been selected and elected all glory to god for such a time as this jesus had to be broken open in order that the seed to let forth its life to water other seeds that was coming if you want the church start with the word of god if you want the life of god start with the word of god start with what the word of god the word of god is the basis that that that you get to god last night bible study was talking about ziggler when david came home and meet all his his wife's taken away and his house is burned and everybody crying and weeping and afterwards they feel into stone david and david encouraged himself in the lord and david i said oh god i'm sorry oh god i fell up i can't take it no more david wasn't talking david had one question to ask god shall i pursue you in other words and god said you shall recover all pursue god tell them the end game you will get back everything you know what if they were feeling elected one of our prayer meeting after that he outed his spirit he missed the lord no wasn't that wasn't time to pray no his time is of the essence you have to get into action he had to push you to get back all you can say oh god god told me he have a testimony no he said that testimony god bless you brother drink at night god tell me go and recover all hallelujah thank you in jesus name advance that just religious spirit center there's not god talking there you know god's saying you're covering all your but pursue some different men couldn't cross over they're so tired and weary they couldn't make and david write all night long hallelujah you had a fight you know if you think you could sit down on your bottom and expect blessings to fall that's not like somebody looking for a job and they're praying day and night then oh god give me a job in jesus name hallelujah they're praying here they're coming to the bedroom oh god you have to pray and go to the house and look for a job and got the direction of the best job the job not coming inside the house if you say you're expecting that you're a liar oh glory to god don't get me started tonight praise god david said pursue god say pursue and when david finished the bible said and david recovered all and we're gonna get back everything the devil took from us we're gonna get it back we're gonna recover all our scripture i will restore saith the lord all with the conquer woman the caterpillar and the palmer worm and the lucas my people shall eat and be in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord dear god he said my people shall never never be ashamed [Applause] oh god i could brag in this word i could boast in this world because my god is not dead he's alive and he's a goddess keep his word he said my people and i'll never be ashamed you might be ashamed no but the prophecy hanging over you is that you shall never be ashamed because god bless you and your cop going to run over and he could be protected for you in the presence of your enemies oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah get off your religious mask hallelujah get off them enticing spirits oh glory god i'm talking to you if you're not obey any word let me say that god is not speaking to you if you're not obeying the word husband love your wife that's the word wife listen to your husband respect your husband reference your husband that is the word you can't get a dream above that i can't get a revelation about that that is just a word oh glory to god children obey your parents that is the word you can't get no revelation above that that is just a word oh glory give the lord some praises you may be seated now watch the works all right god's son which is jesus was his example seed what his life was when the spirit pulled upon him after his baptism the holy ghost come upon him ouch you mean jesus didn't take it by fit you mean something come upon him you mean generally saw it you mean god tell john the one upon whom that dove come down and re-mean it because sometimes he does come and move away you know when he does land and recognizes the wolf this is the gun you know what the one that the dove land and remain that's the one you know i see duff hitting people and okay i think but afterwards stay in but when john see that one come on jesus and let him move he said behold the lamb of god he could identify the messiah because god told him what to look for isn't that right all right so they forgot son was his example seed and what his life was when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism the holy ghost come upon him and the very life that he produced well that same watering spirit of the holy ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did if there's if it's the same seed son of god seed will bring forth son of god's seed if it's the same seed now the spoken word is the original seed spoken by who by god and god's more beat is his prophets so the word coming out the mouth of the prophet is the original seed and the bride will be impregnated by god's own seed which is from the mouth of the prophet that's why he says say what the tapes say because them tapes those words are seeds the seed is the word of god the sower is the son of man and we are promised that day the son of man will be revealed that means the son of man coming his last day to bring seeds now when the son of man coming back he doesn't come out for seeds when somebody plant corn they conversely corn green they come in and see the process go through and they see a whole air of corn you're planting one seed but you're expecting a whole air some fifty fold some sixty fold some a hundred full but all have to bring forth or give the lord a shout hallelujah and this was the great parable that jesus teach as a foundation for all of the parables you have to understand the parable of the sower and the seed okay let's go now the gate to the soul remember there's a womb of the physical and there's a womb for the spirit there's a spiritual womb and there's a physical womb now the mind is the womb to the spirit just as a woman has a womb a mind is a womb justice there's a physical womb there's a spiritual wound now how is adultery that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you know better by the word of god by the intercourse of the mind taking a lie of the devil against the word of god that's adultery jesus said that every man would be a lie and minds be true now that's exactly what eve done with spiritual intercourse first that comes by believing satan's lie into the womb of a mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act take place so first is a mind thing let's continue and that's the only way a woman can ever commit adultery against a husband is to let some man talk into it then receive another man that's not a husband then she comes with adultery and when the bride of jesus christ lets man-made creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of god she is committing adultery no rapture for that i call them tribulation saints oh glory to god do you understand what i'm saying it have no rapture with false teaching and false doctrine that is adultery that's adultery because you can't find that in the word you can't find another message man invent that because that's easy for people to believe because man invent that he dreamed that something hit him some things strike him but he's not in the world paul saver angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel let him be a curse we have a plum line to measure everything with or give the lord a shout nobody's supposed to pull wool over my eye praise god hallelujah you had to be a blind like a bat for somebody to pull all over your eye god sent ice alvin this last day that you could see clearly oh glory to god hallelujah god sent isil that you might see that your way wouldn't be stumbling and fumbling oh glory to god let me let's go i want the bride of jesus christ let man made trees and dogmas take that's why i don't i don't play with that you know as soon as there's something false it's sure you know what what if it could be right how many could be right here there's a lot could be waiting so somebody said be careful what you see you know not pretty but not before doctrine and teaching is chopped it's wood yes rolled over like a rolling pin like a steam roll over that that is dead like the same devil that come in the garden eating god wasn't talking to the serpent said what is he what what uh he what did god say she said god say we eat on the tree but and she missed don't touch it because the day that did you die no she said exactly what god said she didn't know it herself adam told her because the god told adam all those words that he could teach eve so eve was getting from adam and the serpent had no voice god wasn't speaking to him so he needed to understand what was the word that they had what for not to be edified what for to twist it and those anointed with satanic and fallen angel spirits all they're doing is twisting things they can't help it because the devil up there told a lie and caused angels to follow him and they were kicked out on the earth and that's how the battle of angel became the battle of men but we're fighting right back because we understand the battle glory the god i ain't taking that show praise god ain't gonna take licks lying down i'll go fight back everything i have anything i have gonna fight back i come tonight to fight right back oh glory to god but my womb is already closed praise god i am impregnated by christ's own seed word or give the lord a shout no man interpretation can get inside of here no man's idea could get inside the deal my womb is closed that's why i go pumbaa just the word oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah i hope your home is closed too all right let's go here we go did not jesus say whosoever looked upon a woman had committed adultery with her already in his heart what let it come into his mind so that's why jesus promote this whole thing with adultery not just physical touching anybody just the lust it already commits in this mind what i mean she doesn't come in the line that's the womb that stand the thing that started things moving sit and come in well now we were sold with the word what he failed to do mary did she took the word eve took satan's lie mary talks god's word and mary's seed replenishes the earth again through his bride through the world and will bring up the millennium what did mary said be it done unto me according to your word and she hit satan at slap she just take the wood and she's had to act on it isn't that right now watch something okay though that goes for the word and the word is planted into every predestinated heart and the spirit comes out and watered and they cannot die i'll raise him up at the last day he said brother sister that is real what is it the mind is the womb for the spirit to take in or let out that is how they commit adultery is by taking or let satan devil spirit put in something against the word of god then she commits adultery now watch look eve what did she do she received here we go the wrong seed how did she do it believe in satan's life and brother branham said this way you cannot accept the devil's line until you reject god's truth so rejection of truth set up people to receive lies you see all this world there's so much conspiracy theories people are believing all kind of madness and listen we could see them looking like it might bend them when they were it's real they're under strong delusion and people come in this message coming on a strong delusion to believe a lie and be done by it that's the devil in them praise god hallelujah all right she received satan lie what did she bring forth by doing it satan said you know this is glorious this is a wonderful thing do you know that you were made for that why you were actually made for this purpose who was i was present to the eyes good you should you should try it but the lord god said not yet wait a minute but you know you shall not surely die that's slick tongue devil he ain't got hoofs and folktale no they try to make you believe that he's a slicker behind a pulpit same devil but this time wearing jacket and tie that is incredulous no no red tail and pitchfork and thing like that you know well she could belong to a big church she could well told in the city that's exactly what satan would try to see with the when it would have got come to mary but she shook him away how can this be the holy ghost will overshadow you it's the word of god be it done unto me according to thy word that brought the life there you are praise god what do you know satan said they would laugh at you that little rosie chick gill didn't pay any attention to that right up to julia she went you know i'm going to have a baby before she felt anything because the word has already been set there she didn't have to go through a prayer line a second time she believed she didn't have any sign of life she never understand her pregnancy she never felt nothing she just said god said so oh glory to god and that's how i want you to become whatever the words say i believe it i receive it i'm going to act upon it god said it oh glory to god if your little finger move your whole hand stiff and if your little finger moved at night god is able to move your next finger on your next finger and your whole hand and your whole situation could be changed tonight oh glory to god hallelujah she said god said i'm gonna have a baby why god said so what's that the royal seed of abraham so the royal seat of abraham said god said so devil's a liar i don't care what the doctors say i believe what god said oh glory to god god said so abraham what do you say 25 years ago but god said so there you are hallelujah praise god so to both physical and spiritual but eve and anytime and any time a woman takes a wrong step she has to fully receive it in her mind some slicker has to persuade her and she listened to it against her own better judgment than the actors committed so first satan hit eve mine and in the womb of a mind she doubted god's word so what satan introduced is a question and anytime you start with question on god's word you're on your way out there must be no question on god's word so first satan hit eat mine and in the womb of her mind she doubted god's word then come the actual act and here he's flipping it over now and the only way that we could ever be born again is first in the womb of the mind so your mind have to get a transformation like how esther owned and i said question with me how esther got this transformation when when mordecai sent a message to him tell her you think you sit in the palace day that you will be safe you better wake up you know if you figure things are not coming to you then health have to come from somewhere else how do you not know that you are there for such a time as this all the time esther just staying there queenness are just sitting there normal normal normal and the people about to get killed she got a wake-up call that she had to reframe her thinking as to what she's doing there and you better get a wake-up call tonight to reshape your thinking as to what you are here for what you're in this message for what you're in the service for reframe how you're thinking hallelujah for such a time as this [Applause] you may be seated and because her thinking was reframed a readjustment and she knew you cannot go in the prison of king accepted being called she said if i perish that's an anchor point you know as a punchy cowboy back on you know if i perish i perish i go into the presence of the king oh glory to god i ain't waiting for no call i am desperate oh glory to god i did this and if there's a fall of backslidden but i'm desperate i am going in the presence of the king i need help tonight i need a breakthrough tonight i need deliverance tonight oh glory to god for my smoking drinking back biting lost and fornicating praise god whatever it is i need a preacher tonight whatever it is i am desperate [Music] and the only way you can ever be born again is first in the womb of the mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's real gospel teaching brother if saint paul was standing today he will teach the same thing i do in this hour he said this year brother george is real gospel teaching oh glory to god hallelujah praise god oh people god bless you hear me i can't believe nothing but god's word i want it to be my life everything that i am i want you to do the same let your walks let me go your talks your moves everything you do be in the word of god let the minor christ come into you and that will pregnant you with the word if you don't if you let the mind of denomination come in you you'll be denominationally impregnated if you let the mind of christ come into you he can't deny his own word because he is god you'll be pregnant with the word and believe it i don't care if they put you out kick you out run you out every door is closed you will go be just the same christ here we go is now taking himself a bride to be pregnant with his own seed word who is doing that christ is taking himself a bride to be pregnated with his own seed word what does first thessalonians 4 say the lord himself descend from heaven with a shout and that choke is seven thunders it have something that names seven thunders that is the short message that he's sent with that's the bridal message that's only for the bride church members can believe whatever they want to believe but them seven thunders that short message is for the pride only it will gather the bright together it will give the bright fate it will show the right heart to be pure wait till them seventh hundredths of the vote to that group that could take the same word and hand it there oh give the lord a shout let's precise and cut oh glory to god you're on the right track tonight glory to god this seed what is already in you oh glory though we are preaching to seed believers glory to god we are preaching the seated people the spirit is coming to ride you the spirit is coming to monk you the spirit is coming to overshadow you you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you you shall be witnesses oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah christ is now taking himself a bride to be pregnated with his own seed word in her spirit womb in her mind that won't mix with any denominational trash with it she's a virgin to him isn't that right it's not something else christ's own seed in you it have more coming jesus said he that receiveth them who i send receives me i know them that he sends and then that receives me receive him that sent me you can only serve god as you can serve god as you do and believe the servants that god sends you can only serve god and eat as god's servants that sent on earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you some people could interpret the word by mental intellect and have something called divine inspiration now you want to put the scriptures down and he says first corinthians 6 14 16 paul said you follow me as i follow christ he didn't say follow me only he said as i follow christ all right then he was going to read this luke 10 16. he that heareth you here at me he despises you despise it me he despises me this was him that sent me that proves that god speaks his message to his servants always has now the power of the believe in church christ has all power in heaven you believe that now what if he's in you has christ got all power matthew 28 18 right he is the seed word in his body he is and he is in us becomes the seed word in us now all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was was brought into the church now that's the power the seed of christ must come through the body are you getting you said i want to get this in real good i want to grind on the seed of christ must and he said must must come to his body not your denomination but you are born again seed of the word it must come true remember what it is christ's seed how does my seed come through my body now see through the body and the church is the body of christ that's right the bible church this birth produces the new boot himself in body his church in the church now we're going to get to something deep now watch this see church this real church with the real true sperm now remember god never committed his preaching and his gospel to angels how many knows that how he knows that galatians 1 8 if an angel comes from him and preached something else he said so the angel is wrong if it's a different word god committed his gospel to men he never committed the angels now philip was up to pentecost to worship isn't that right and the eunuch ethiopian eunuch he was with the disease and elderly and so on and he was studying the prophecy of isaiah and we know god took philip from that event for that some service and bring him to the equivalent right although an angel direct directed philip to him but the dream of life had to come to the body and philip was part of that body philip was the channel that god was going to use and this is a reproduction of another book of acts this going to be this bright church in the last days this would be part of how the bride could be in action in the last days because the seed word that the bride is impregnated with going to be in the bright body oh glory to god that seeds gonna be in the bright body in other words the word will become flesh the invisible will become visible because the word will be in you god is gonna be in you oh glory to god hallelujah one day gonna wake up and recognize he is in you oh glory to god there's no fairy tale philip had it peter had it we're gonna read about it oh glory to god although our angel directed philip to him but the germ of life had to come to the body philip where did the jed come from to the angel no the angel showed him where to go our angel is a messenger here is a son philip philip had the germ the message the word that is how our child was born philip laid his hands upon him philip baptized him in the name of jesus christ and there come from the spirit of god now the germ had to come from the body what body christ body correct and philip was a member of that body and the same thing took place with peter in acts 10 48 peter was at house of the top angel directed into cornelius house but where did the word come from the body oh i said i feel pretty good i feel like traveling on an angel come and say don't worry call nothing unclean just go think nothing and while peters picked these words peter wasn't doing something and trying to hook up a sweat he was just speaking the word and the bible said while peter was picked respect these words the holy ghost somebody showed up holy ghost that same holy ghost we talked about before the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word that holy ghost was coming under peter's mouth the word and the spirit is one god take the word and for and put spirit out upon it oh and they were baptized with the holy ghost and he wasn't baptizing water yet don't give the lord a shout oh glory to god the heart was ready oh glory to god to receive fire fire fire fire oh glory to god god wants your heart ready glory to god while peter speak these words what he was the body he had the word the word took a whole brother and angel directed it but the life come true the body of christ hallelujah paul was on his way to damascus a vision directed him but an ass ananias had the germ and the word said prophet ananias saw a vision and said go there and lay your hands upon him paul received his sight because an ass was in the body are you in the church triumphant are you in the savior's bride come and be baptized into the body and forever more pride you have to be impregnated with the seed word in the body oh glory to god christ's own seed inside of you oh glory the word oh glory to god oh praise god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory the holy spirit is here tonight let's go hallelujah jesus said my sheep know my voice hallelujah might as strange that they would not follow they won't follow anybody i say nothing contrary to the voice of god now you see here we go that seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of knowledge so all these ministers trying to crack mysteries and crack information that the prophet didn't say to make this they get these things excited and stickling these are misses let me call them for now ticklers have believers with itchiness they hear new stuff they're weary here in these promises i ain't worried at all these things here i appreciate nothing new i preach all these things already i afraid to bring it back the human mind is slutful people forget what god promised when you come and hit this word so it's waking up to your new consciousness and more than that you're gonna be hearing hearing a new revelation of it but tonight may be your night of revelation and when god break it upon you all your old leaves fall off and new leaves have to break out upon you oh glory to god because you come on the divine revelation oh give the lord some praises tonight this seed word this is dusty of the lord this seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of knowledge do you know knowledge carry atmosphere do you know all these intellectuals have atmosphere it doesn't make people shout out and whatnot they can't go too far and short this is a repentance i'll be emotional yeah yeah yeah yeah religion that is dead should be buried you see where there is god there is noise when when aaron had to go in the temple he had her bells ringing and they have a big long rope tying him because in case he falls dead inside there they can't go inside they said they had to pull him out but then bills had to be ringing and then ringing saying holy holy unto the lord god want to hear that noise and heaven have seraphs flying day and night holy

producer now so stop being barren you know oh give the lord a shout don't get me started tonight glory to god y'all have to come out to baroness you know oh glory to god when you plant a grain or corn you don't want to get bubble corn bubble corn you're planting a whole person i'm hanging one green and alcohol yeah boiling that we're doing with that you're trying another way you have nothing to do with bubble corn we call it a bubble calling trainer for the people who don't know what it is is when the whole corn ea have one grain in it or two grains i give you a waste of time there's a waste of time calling you to oil so when you sign a man coming here going for corn greens he's coming to see what he can produce he come and see what fruit you produce and your food could be your works no some

works where's the fruit he only read my books yeah i play them book tapes long time every day play the team with the fruit well you know what i mean you know what it is tribulation yes that's always weeping and winning nationality god asks you who your pastor is and what church you go to god isn't asking you all along and messing with books you read that teeth on the cross say remember me jesus said today you'll be with me in paradise there is a last minute reprieve to go to paradise not this time you know too much is given what is expected so do better than our last memory preview you know weeping and wheeling and national teeth better get it within government and the wedding government is the baptist holy ghost not mysteries not information not knowledge that the peddling had had in his message for years with nothing behind it just talk who could talk more and who could talk along sometimes the longer they talk is the more it looks special all right so we pump in this wood tonight won't be along with you time running all right all right let's hear this now butterburner okay so the seed green the green seed the original fell at nicer room it was the first denomination notice here we go the life that was in the stalk tussle no ends up in the seed the life the life that comes out of the original seed come to different processes and turns back to its original condition so when you plant a corn seed a stock come up down the seed it goes to possesses leaves stalk and then they can't put a flower and that flower is like a testimony a corn coming then you see a little corn come at the side and it has something along it we call the corn hub the husk and different things that's like the shock when you pick the corn you have to pull all that yeah sammy and when things green everybody's looking green see looking green sharp looking green they're looking green but then come the hot sun and the hot sun is the right in the green and then the shark spirit pulls away you don't pull away from them and then away from you so you know you don't have to put nobody knowing others have that pulling away and they have that scripted twitter to separate yourself from such turn away that time is shock talking nothing i shock behavior but the seed golden brown you're imagining your storm you're facing your storm you're no longer asking god deliver me the living give me no you want to know how to manage your storm you got that sunday gone oh let's see we can wrap up here here it is now here the light that was in the husk in the stalk in the tussle all gathers in the seed watch and the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification middleweight personification some religion made a way for the baptist and the background he goes made away for our promise the holy ghost itself to come down right in perfection and back to the word of god again all the history of church when it organized it died right there the life leaves the stalk to make the tassel from the tassel it makes the husk from the husk it goes into the original green again how noticeable this life is is to travel in the corner wheat than it is in a tree no go people is like a tree the light goes down come back up but not in the corner wheat he is making a comparison here in the corner wheat it goes up from the original stalk through the stock tassel husk and the thing that it passed through dies it can't get back to it again what is it it is no use anymore oh hallelujah but here this part now but when the green but when the green light begins to leave the husk i like always say the green life so the husk have a certain portion of life that the green needs and after a while the green life of the husk move on and he was gathering the life oh hallelujah so watch this when the grain life begins to leave the husk to go to make the green the bride i'm reading oh you mean the life itself is not making the bride then you mean them second computer 147 you mean that the bright spirit challenging every other spirit you mean like christ's own life you mean this life is the bride let's read it when the grain life begins to leave the husk to go in to make the grain the bride the horse opens up and excommunicate the grain that is nature oh hallelujah let me wrap up here now talking about the bride she is smitten from the church okay just like joseph the bride is spinning from the church because she is the word the word living and in action the bible bride what's the description for you tonight what is your number right the word the word living and in action the bible bride not some man-made bride the bible bride smitten afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her she stands alone god promised rabbit sinner there's a looter he promised other things in the raise of others but now he promised us a full square meal the full 7 course menu for all seven scenes are open and everything is ready for the word of god for those who can receive it oh praise god so watch she's dry shock it's past the spirit of god passed through her and you hear people with testimonies of when the lord was with them and all the lord used them how much years ago spirit passed through but what happened now that's why you have to fight for fresh experience that's why that's something called refilling we fill it in the filling all over again it's a fresh feeling of god a fresh experience of god you have to want that you have to ask for that you have not because your acts not you have to ask for the holy ghost you don't sit down and rock back brahma said the early church do like they didn't have none at all they're always asking god sent on your power once more they get blows and licks and didn't take sick leave and stop coming to service for wednesday night praise god they came back to the prayer meetings lord give us some strength to go back and preach the gospel and then fellows just get licks earlier any day look at the lord's praises and when they pray that kind of prayer holy ghost hit them again and they're ready to go out and jam them out there with the gospel of jesus christ because this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come if you think we go sitting in church all the time that that will happen we have to be a witness of this message but he's the same yesterday today and forever there will be one more ride oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah listen to this bomb as we close she is the dry shark it passed the spirit of god passed through her and she will not be here with the vindicated seed word she sure will not be she will not be in the rapture she'll be a church member may come up in a second resurrection be judged according to what she heard oh my hallelujah and then when you become subject to that spirit it choose your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit tear this brother george is nothing in the world but this seed would made manifest or quickened or made alive so that's why jesus could say the words that i speak they are spirit and they are life because you know if you receive the word and god switched to switching you it turned to spirit oh hallelujah what is it here it is it's the illness of the resurrection this body will be raised again because it's already started it once was subject to sin maya and corruption now it's got an earnest tune heavily so the witness of the spirit in you is evidence that you're on your way to the rapture hallelujah now what kind of seed is in you what kind of seed you are shows what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside you just can't keep from it you can't make that tree anything but what it is that's right the holy spirit transform the seeds on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is if it's evil it will bring for evil if it's hypocrite it'll be for hypocrite if it's genuine word of god it will bring forth genuine son the daughters of god by the transforming of the seed militants come up please but abraham as we close one night i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasp this pen to write his spirit give me a message for the church i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride and the spirit was writing to him said this here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each seed species bring forth after its own kind it might go into genesis 1 11. and god said let the it bring forth grass he'll be then seed fruit tree and fruit after his kind whose seed in himself upon the earth it was so whatever life was in the seed comes forth in a plant against the fruit the same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it's the same seed in these last days the true bright church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be a super church a super race as she nears him this is god speaking now there in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image nice second peter 147 very image this image here this is in order to be united with him there will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god when people read in text they will be the manifestation of the text that they're reading denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word their mongolizing brings forth a hybrid product the first the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself so the bride was given to be impregnated with christ's own seed that's the title we have tonight oh glory to god the only reason there's a bride is to have a reproduction or give the lord some praises tonight nothing less than that a reproduction of the original grain let's go watch so that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell back hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also spoke of seed word of god was given to a bride like like was adam but before he could marry her she had also fallen she like aaron's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word and live and daughter wouldn't die she doubted she left the word she died here we go now from a little group of are you ready the true seed of the word now this is god almighty speaking this a group from where the true seed of the word now that implies there's a false seed the group coming out of the truth of the word will present christ a beloved bride she's a version of his word she's a virgin because she knows no man make queries or dogmas by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to remain manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that would have promised was he himself to remain manifest god was made manifest here we go he himself acted at that time and fulfill his own word of promise no manufacturing necessary oh gloria has pumped that word abraham pumped for 25 years and elohim come walk in the night and say i will return unto thee according to the time of life hallelujah glory to god it was an angel that brought her the message but the angel message was the word of god from isaiah 6 which is scripture he fulfill that at that time the members of the virgin birth would love him they will have his potentials for he is their head not some church overseas not some man's overseas he christ is the head isn't that right and watch and all paul belongs to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed in by the father this harmony is known to exist between the groom and his brain he sure has word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her why you can receive it no doubt about it no weapon form against you could possibly you you have to believe that the angels of the lord and camp around those who fear him you have to believe that glory to god now here's the secret the word is in the brine as it is in mary as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word and that gun is not arguably today all right she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus said the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest silver and its purpose those in the bride do only his will only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus here the lord or they keep still so these seven thunder seas had to be planted for us to have a seventh on the revival may the lord bless you tonight quicken that word to you tonight inspired by his love for you
