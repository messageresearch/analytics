tonight or this afternoon but I do want to read one scripture and then we're going right into the little uh testimonies and and uh little stories that I've I've got to tell you this morning acts and I think brother bisc or somebody read it earlier this week acts 1 and8 and acts 1 and8 but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all of Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth father we thank you again today Lord we want to come and once more we want to express our love to you lord lord we want to be found making love to you today lord it's just a testimony service but God we know that you're in testimonies we know that you're in the preaching of the word we know that uh that you're in the song singing of the songs of Zion God you're in all of creation Lord we give you praise Glory and Honor today we pray pray that you would bless this little test testimony service or these little stories that brother Kenny has to tell Lord may they bless somebody Lord if one person is blessed by these little stories then we have made a progress in the kingdom of God today Lord we love you we praise your holy name amen God bless you you may be seated I'm surprised that so many people came back looks like some didn't hope I didn't step on their toes and if I did they need to be stepped on this afternoon I just want to give testimony and and maybe some late some little stories um uh both um you know I I I've met the prophet people asked me they said brother Kenny uh how old were you I said well look this is no secret I was born in 1950 so in 1965 when the prophet died I was 15 years old I remember quite a bit and yes I did have chance to meet the prophet being his home so maybe we'll tell a couple of those little stories um in a small humble way I have been privileged to see a few things and and know just a few things that God has done in this generation but it's not only we are a privileged generation every one of us sitting here today you know and the Bible tells me more blessed are those who have not seen and still believe you know I've I've seen a lot of things a lot of Miracles sometimes I've questioned God why why did he allow me to see these things and you know really it just speaks to a weakness in Me God knew I think God knew I had to see what I saw you know God's infinite he knew I had to see what I saw in order to be at this place in my life but you are more blessed if you're sitting here and you've never seen those things you are even more blessed that you can believe them without seeing so more blessed are those who have not seen and still believe I guess he just allowed me to see those things because I had a big mouth he knew I would tell him I wouldn't hold back amen you know I told Brother I told Brother colen Brer I said now when I do this I like to do it in an informal setting you know I I like to I like to do this around a campfire you know in in somebody's Den you know and and uh just kind of relax a little bit but I think with this many people this is about in as informed formal as I can get pull my coat off and roll my sleeves up so I guess in some sense I am in an informal setting church I have I have been privileged to see see things and but before I relate those stories I'd like to ask my brother Brian to come on the piano um and I'm doing that for this reason I always remember brother George Smith remembers I always remember growing up at the brandham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville and we sang this little song now when when they cut all the singing out of the tapes maybe some of you younger people have never heard this song but I want to sing this little song for you this is a song that we sang as I was growing up at the brandham Tabernacle and I think I actually think somebody in Canada uh wrote it or something and maybe if somebody here would know and they can tell me but the little song goes like this I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the first born praise God I've been in this church since the Foundation of this Earth and that is why I have taken Jesus name I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the first born I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the first born praise God I've been in this church since the Foundation of this earth that is why I have taken Jesus name now if you read Acts 2 and 4 and refuse to read anymore there's an eye watching you you'll have trouble at the gate about acts 238 if I were you I'd make the change I am a Bible be sing with me believing Apostolic Christan and a member of the Church of the firstborn I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn praise God I've been in this church since the foundation of this earth that is is why I have taken Jesus name now here's the verse I like our Prophet William Brandon has said or Andor make haste St bright it's later than you think get ready for the bridegroom he's coming very very soon we'll fly through the air but we won't stop at the Moon I am the Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn I am a Bible believing Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn praise God I've been in this church since the foundation of this earth that is why I have taken Jesus name I'm going to sing that last verse again our Prophet William brandham has said or and or make haste oh bright it's later than you think get ready for the bridegroom he's coming very soon will fly through the air but we won't stop at the Moon I am a Bible beling Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn I am a Bible beleving Apostolic Christian and a member of the Church of the firstborn praise God I've been in this church since the found station of this earth that is why I have taken Jesus [Music] name God bless you thank you my voice is pretty much gone but uh I thank you for allowing me to do that today well let's see where do I start um I have seen many many many what I call General Miracles I'm talking about I have seen um Twisted limbs made straight automatic right on the spot instantly I've seen blinded eyes open on the spot instantly I've seen all kind of healings instant healings I've seen healings where they weren't instant they weren't maybe Miracles like that and and two weeks later or 3 days later they would come back and claim their healing um I've seen many many people brought into the services on stretchers and Cs and uh and seen them get up and walk out on their own but you know and I can't I don't know all those people uh we had we had two different crowds when I was growing up at the Tabernacle we had the the crowd that uh would lived there and went there on a reg your bases then we had the the huge crowds that came in uh when brother random was in town brother George was one of those he wasn't a regular he was just one of those that came in where brother brandom came in but we always counted him as one of us but we uh we had two different crowds and uh now a lot of people that came in from just for the meetings I didn't know them I didn't know their name I knew they got healed but I I'm going to dwell to today on on those that I did know most of the local people that I knew and that we knew for a fact that they were they were having problems and they spoke to the the man of God and they they were healed so you bear with me this morning pray for me uh growing up in Jeffersonville Indiana in the 50s and 60s we lived in such an atmosphere of Faith anything that happened anything that the devil brought would bring into our lives we knew if we could get a hold of that prophet he could speak the word it's much like the prophet Elisha when he spoke to the little widow woman or or all the great prophets when they spoke to somebody and and and spoke the word and it became manifested so that's the that's the uh atmosphere that we grew up in and uh the first one I will tell you about my brother is healing my brother was uh 5 years younger than me and when he got to be about 12 years old he got sick and the family took him to the doctor and uh the doctor couldn't find out what was wrong with him so they took him home and he kept getting sicker and sicker and so so then after a few days they took him to another doctor he had great pain and uh he just still kept getting sick they didn't know what was wrong with him finally it got so bad and the pain got so bad that they rushed him to the hospital one night the emergency room and in the emergency room they did some tests and some scans and everything and they found out that his appendix had burst and that there was uh poison from those bursted appendix running all through his body and I was standing there and the doctor came out of the emergency room he turned to my father and he said Mr caps he said I'm sorry to tell you your son appendix had bursted said there's too much poison in his body said he probably won't live till morning many of you parents have been in those situations and you know it was strange my father didn't get real excited he just after the doctor left he said we got to call brother brandom so at that time they had the pay phones he went with a pay phone and started putting coins in the pay phone and he called brother ROM's house but there was no answer and still he didn't get too excited he said well he said I'll call Billy Billy will know where he's at so he called Billy's house Billy Paul's house and uh Billy answered the phone I was standing by him my father said uh Billy Billy he said uh do you know where your father is he said they say my son's going to die he said I need to speak with your father and uh brother Billy said well I I don't know exactly brother caps but he said uh he said uh Daddy went target shooting with Joseph and said uh I don't know when they'll be back but said uh whenever I see him today I'll have him call you well he got ready to hang up the phone and Billy said wait a minute brother caps he said Daddy just pulled in the driveway brother brandom came to the phone now we found out later the reason he stopped at Billy's house was because he and Joseph were out target shooting and this is the first time that he had outshot his dad in other words he had shot better than his dad and so Joseph was excited because he had done better than his dad and he wanted to go by Billy's house to tell his big brother that he had beat his dad in target shooting but we know the real reason the real reason because brother brandom could speak to the situation so brother brandom came to the phone and and uh of course I heard my father's side of the conversation and I was told later the other side but my father said U brother brandom he said I need to talk to he said the doctor say my son's going to die he may die before morning he said brother Brandon would you pray and still he wasn't really excited and we just didn't get excited about those things because we knew the prophet would take care of it and he said would you pray and and and and that God would heal the boy you know and uh he said told me later he said brother brandham did not even pray he just said thus sayith the Lord Brother caps your son won't die your son shall live my brother went home the next morning he lives today in cooko Indiana there was a time when brother Brandon was in a meeting in Louisville Kentucky at the church of the open door and uh my grandfather really wasn't a message person he really wasn't a Believer but he was a Christian so he went over to the church there to see uh to see the man of God and he had been having heart problems and uh the doctors didn't expect him to live he he he had a bad heart and at this time my my grandfather was in his late 40s and uh he was sitting in the meeting there in that church and now brother Rand did not call his name but he said there's a man sitting back way back in about the 18th row I think it is and he said he's got on a gray suit he's got on a gray and red tie he said oh brother he said the the Lord shows me you've got a bad heart the doctor said you won't last long he said God heals your heart go home and be made well my grandfather lived to be in his 80s before he died and there's another little story about my grandfather I'll relate while I'm there and I don't have any particular order I'm just I told my wife coming over here I said you know I need to get all these things things organized and and uh and and put my notes together a little better and she said well you're going to have to start using your iPad I guess but uh my grandfather uh my dad and I supp I suppose most of you know my father was brother branham's uh song leader when he was in Jeffersonville he was uh brother Neville's assistant uh he was the adult Sunday school teacher at the Tabernacle he uh he he preached most when brother random wasn't in town brother Neville would preach Sunday morning and usually my father would preach Sunday night and uh now when my father was a boy growing up his parents my grandparents lived in burksville Kentucky and I hope every one of you know where brother Brandon was born in burville Kentucky so it's was kind of strange they were they were they came from the same area and then when uh when my father was just a little boy like when brother Brandon was a little boy uh my grandparents moved to Jeffersonville the same thing that brother brandom's parents did I don't know I'm not trying to make something out of that I'm just saying it's kind of odd but U my great-grandfather down in burksville Kentucky was a Methodist circuit writer and I think most of you know what that is he would ride around from Village to Village and on Horseback and he would preach at churches along the way uh my grandfather that was my great-grandfather my grandfather was not a preacher but then my dad became a preacher and uh my grandfather had left the Methodist Church and joined the Nazarene church so my father grew up in the Nazarene church and uh he was he had been ordained in the Nazarene church and he was and then he he uh in Jeffersonville he started hearing about brother brandham and the message and he tells many stories of seeing brother random out around town and so forth and uh but he uh he was working in Chicago Illinois and my uh or brother brandom was in uh I think it was ma High School auditorium in Chicago Illinois and he went and visited and the Lord got a hold of it and so he he grabbed a hold of the message and he'd been serving the me uh serving the lord in the message for many years so he began praying he began praying for his father my grandfather and uh we would pray as a family he would pray you know Lord give Dad give Granddad the the revelation of the message he wanted him to come out of the Nazarene church and come into the message but even in the late 60s in 1965 it still hadn't happened and so he had an interview with brother brandham one time and he said brother brandham can you tell me something about my father he said I keep witnessing to him I want him to come out of that Nazarene system I want him to come to the message he said can you tell me something about my father he said brother brandom sit in the office there and he had a way of looking up for just a minute or so and he looked back at my father and he said oh brother caps he said the Lord shows me your father he said don't worry about your father he'll be there he said now brother caps he said let me explain why he said your father came up under the Wesleyan message he said that's all he's responsible for but said he'll be there on that day now and I've thought a lot about that 65 the seals had been open we had the full revealed word and yet my grandfather was still in the Nazarene Church the prophet said he'd be there could it be that we're a little quick to judge sometimes you know I hear years ago I heard many times people say oh don't don't mess with them they're just in Pentecost hey there may be some people now granted they would probably be old people but there may be some people who was raised in Pentecost and they'll be there because that's their message and that's all they're responsible for I'm just saying it could could be so we shouldn't be so quick to put people in and put people out but that one little interview with brother brandom that I later heard about convinced me I don't have all the answers and I don't know everything so I try to just love everybody share what I can with people and just go about my business than you Lord Jesus we had some stories of some personal friends oh let me just say this before I do that how many here has heard about Hatty Wright I knew hady right there's not too many people alive today who can say that but I knew hady right uh those two boys that received their salvation were friends of mine now my brother-in-law had horses and we would go riding horses and they lived about 10 miles from Hatty ride so whenever the the horses needed to have new shoes put on them we would ride the horses over to Hatty Wright's house and the boys would put those two boys they would uh put new shoes on the horses and I've been in Hatty Wright's house and when I was in it it was still a dirt floor she didn't have anything just poor as poor as could be but she was a real True Believer and I believe with all my heart that Hattie Wright is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ if the bride can get to the point where they say that's nothing but the truth brother brandom then I think we've made progress hady Wright was not much to look at I'm sorry I don't know about your new shoes and your new suit and your new dress but the bride ain't too much to look at sometimes but she wasn't much to look at she'd come to church and she'd have old grandma clothes on and she was a cook and she'd have sometimes food on her dress and she had long hair and sometimes she didn't have much style to it she just kind of piled it up on her head and it was going everywhere and she only had one tooth left in her head and as a small kid in my early years most of us kids were afraid of her cuz she just she wasn't a well she's just an old ugly woman that's all she all you can say about her and boy they they've really people really hit me for that saying that Hatty Wright was an ugly woman but that was my impression at the time but I've I've noticed how that when we would have the big meetings and brother Brandon would come in town after church there would be all these big ministers some from Texas with their big cowboy hat and their boots their nice Fine Suits and they'd all be gathered around hadie right they'd don't go around asking now which one is hady right which one is hady right and so somebody would point out had and she always had a crowd around her and she had to always tell the story well she said when brother Brenham said he spoke those squirrels into his she said I knew it was true she said she said uh it had to be true because he said it and she said he said hadie for this saying I give you the desire of your heart he said you can have your your sister's Health you can have money you can have uh uh your your mother and father extend their life he said whatever you say is the way it'll be and she said I just I just looked at him and I said brother brandom my greatest desire in my heart is to see my boy saved well you know the story those two boys were friends of mine uh and in case you do most of you probably know this by now but people would come into town and they say I want to see those two right boys well they weren't right boys their last name was moer so people they they spend many hours trying to find out those right boys there was no right boys because what had happened hadie right that was her maiden name and brother brandom knew the family and he'd always known her as little Hatty rright and that's what he called her well she had gotten married she had those two boys and her husband died just very shortly after those two boys came along so the boys were actually Mosers they were Arville moer and Koy moer but everybody was looking for Hatty Wright's boys they couldn't find them so uh and and if you've got one of George's books the generation book one of those boys is in there and it gives his real name so we we we knew those boys and and the listen they were Rough Boys they were country boys they didn't shave very often maybe twice a year and they didn't care about nice clothes I don't think either one of them ever owned a suit and uh they'd come to church my they were rough seemed like they didn't even comb their hair you know but they're just rough country boys and one of them started liking my sister he tried he tried to be a boyfriend to my sister and she was so embarrassed she said keep him away from [Laughter] me but you know those boys they were good boys after you know they actually had given their their life to the Lord at a very early age when that event happened so I knew them as teenager teenage boys uh very rough you know they've had a rough life one of them's been married married uh three times I think but you can't tell me that those boys aren't saved cuz one of them died last year but I believe that there's ever two boys that's going to be there those two boys [Applause] will how many how many of you remember who Banks Woods was brother Banks Woods was brother brandham best friend he lived next door to him there was Brother brandom's house there was an empty field and then there was Brook Banks Woods house and he became brother brandom's best friend they traveled together they hunted together they did everything together and there's quite an interesting story about brother Banks because people have said and maybe you've heard it I've heard it people have said boy it was a shame about brother Banks wasn't it I what are you talking about well brother brother Banks he left the message he backslid I said man you're crazy he wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't backslide but it's true when brother brandom died I think it was like the next week he went down to the church and he resigned his position as trustee and he left the church as far as anybody knows he never went to the brandom Tabernacle again so they started get making rumors about him he left the message he left the church he he backed he did this he did that and so we heard this for we probably heard this for several months so finally my dad was my dad was friends with him also so he said come on Kenny he said we're going to go see brother Banks so went to Brother Banks house knocked on the door and brother Banks come to the door he said brother Banks he said I'm concerned about you he said people are saying this about you and saying that about you he said is everything all right but the bank said yeah brother caps everything's fine he said well we haven't seen you around the church we heard you resigned he said uh are you sure everything's all right brother Banks started laughing he said brother caps I've got to tell you the story and I was standing there and heard him tell my dad the story he said not long before brother brandham died said he came over to my house one day he walked in and he said brother I want to talk to you he said this is very important I want you to listen to me he said I'm not going to be with you long he said the Lord's going to take me and he said when you've heard that the Lord has taken me I want you to do something in fact he says you have to do something he said you have to leave the Tabernacle and you have to take your wife sister Ruby and you have to go back to Louisville to the Assembly of God Church there almost impossible to believe you know he said I know it's hard to believe brother caps but he said that's exactly what happened he said he told me he said brother Banks if you don't do what I tell you he said you're going to lose your wife sister Ruby he said now she's already had two nervous breakdowns and he said after I'm gone he said there's going to be so much fanaticism rise up about my message he said they're going to drive your wife crazy he said it will destroy her neres he said you're going to lose your wife if I don't if you don't do what I tell you he said now take her back to brother Rogers Church which was the Assembly of God Pastor in Louisville Kentucky he said that's the church she grew up in as a little girl and he said you're to take her there and you're to stay there in that church and she that will be a comfort to her nobody will know where to find her nobody will will uh be able to uh get a hold of her and he said you'll be able to save your wife so brother Banks seeing what he seen knowing what he knew he knew well enough to do what a prophet of God said amen I wonder how many of us really know enough to do what a prophet of God said when he said sisters don't cut your hair when he said Brothers put away those cigarettes quit deceiving people don't be a hypocrite Church some of us better start doing what he says but he brother Banks took his wife sister Ruby and they went back to brother Rogers Church in Louisville Kentucky they put a big fence up around their house you couldn't get in to knock on their door all people tried all they had reports of people craw crawling over the fence and everything else fanaticism but brother Banks did what a prophet of God told him to do and they actually she outlived him I think he died about 10 years ago she died about seven years ago but uh they were doing what the prophet of God said to do we have another friend the West family and the West family were from they were from New Mexico and they would come to the meetings in Jeffersonville Indiana it's a long drive and they had a daughter named Rebecca West and during the park viw meetings if you remember the story the park viw meetings was in an auditorium and on this side they had the nice Auditorium seats the padded seats the C cushion seats but on this side they had a gymnasium and they had seats chairs much like what you're sitting in here and brother Brandon when he would preach on the stage sometimes he would look to this side and sometimes he would look to this side but he was preaching to both sides this particular night I think it was during marriage and divorce he was was looking this way and he was he had finished the sermon he was starting to do the discernment he was looking this way and he go oh he said the Lord shows me oh I see it's a little girl oh the family's from New Mexico he said the little girl two years old oh he said she's got a cleft pallet which means she doesn't have a roof in her mouth and she couldn't talk he said oh he said oh it's the West family brother West from New Mexico he said brother West he said God will heal your daughter but then he said it'll come slowly it'll be many years before she's totally healed well she really still couldn't talk she was uh not in pain or anything after that but the West family and and and within just a year or two after brother brother brandom died my dad went up to Northern Indiana and started his own church and the West family they fell in love with our family they fell in love with my father and mother and and so they decided to move from New Mexico to Indiana where my father had a church and so time went on and Rebecca West the little two-year-old that brother brandham spoke about she got to be about 13 years old and one Sunday they came to church and they just started rejoicing in church the Clift pallet had been fully healed she actually God had recreated the mouth of the of the roof of the mouth she could talk normally everything was normal and she lives in Muny Indiana and don't youall put me out of the message for this but I'm a friend of hers on Facebook and her name is re Rebecca West Coleman and if you want to get a hold of her I'm sure she'd be glad to tell you the story The testimony but we've seen all kind of things like that happen uh we we had a real close family that was friends of ours there it was the shepherd family and I'm sure you probably read about this in the message but the shepherd family they had two boys one boy was uh three years older than me I think the other boy was two years older than me but brother Shepherd the dad he had been very sick and uh she had told the mother had or the wife had told my my mother and different ones there she says I don't know what we're going to do about Alex he says uh he's convinced he's he's got a bad heart or bad back or whatever it was I think he's a bad back and he's convinced he's going to die because he can't live in this pain any longer and so everybody in the church they knew the story but nobody that came in in the in the big crowd when brother Brandon was at they really didn't know the story and so the the mother or the wife had had told everybody said we were out shopping the other day and said I wanted Alex to buy a new pair of shoes he saidoh I'm not buying no new pair of shoes he said I'm not going to spend the money he said he said I'm going to die I don't need a new pair of shoes she said oh Alex don't talk like that he said no I'm going to die he said I don't need he wouldn't buy the new pair of shoes now the story came back later she never told Brother brandom that story so one Sunday morning I'm sitting about six or seven rows back and what you have to understand at the brandom Tabernacle at that time they had a baptistry pool behind the pull pit and they had a curtain back there you really couldn't see unless the curtains were open but the the crowds were so great that they would set chairs in the baptistry I think they had a a a board or something they'd set chairs back there and and they would have many people sitting back in the baptistry they couldn't see brother brandom he couldn't see them so he's preaching one morning and he stops in the middle of his service he says oh he said there's a brother he's he's got serious back problem I think it was back he said he's got serious back problem he said the Lord's going to heal him and he kind of looked up you know he he said oh he said it's our precious brother Shepherd oh and he's back in the baptistry behind the curtain he said oh he said I see he said he was out shopping with his wife she wanted him to buy a new pair of shoes and he wouldn't buy the shoes because he thought he was going to die he said brother Shepherd go home and be healed these are people where I that I knew a lot of things I didn't know I knew I saw it happen but I didn't know them but these are people that I knew and I may just I don't know if look some of these stories were going to sound real spiritual some of them are not some of them are funny some of them are sad and some of them are just stupid brother Shephard had two teenage boys one was three years older than me and one was two and a couple years after their dad was healed we were out playing basketball oh we love basketball in America we were out playing basketball shooting B you know and uh so let's let's go to town get something cold to drink sure okay we lived probably eight blocks from town so we're walking down the street one summer day walking down the street you know just how teenage boys do get up here come here come here we're walking down the street teenage boys and we're just carrying on you know pushing each other shoving each you know we're just having a good time we're friends right go ahead brother thank you walking down the street and you know just teenage boys they're just crazy acting sometime I know now Boys in Europe don't do that probably we're walking down the street I don't y'all don't put me out of the message for this either but I'm just telling the truth okay we walking down the street we just carrying on pushing shoving you know and looked over here one of the boys seen brother brandom driving down the street in the station wagon had his windows down it's hot day you know hey brother brandom how you doing all right boys how you doing he said where your boys going said we're going to town brother brandom going to get a Coke cocacola he said that's where I'm going he said you want to ride sure brother Brandon we take a ride so we get in brother Brandon's car right now the oldest boy gets in the front seat next to brother brandom and me and the youngest boy we're sitting in the back and so we're riding along and the oldest boy in the front seat he turns around to us younger boys he said hey boys he said when I say duck down he said duck down where you can't be seen well you know it's a law as a te teenager if an older teenage boy tells you to do something you have to do it right I mean you just have to do it he said duck down when I say duck down duck down and about that time I looked out the window and there was a girl walking down the street and she's only about half dressed oh she was dressed poorly ah very poorly dressed very immodest and uh about that time the older Shepherd boy he turned around he said duck down well we all duck down and he Ducks down in the FR in the in the front and about that time he lets out a big wolf whistle he lets out a big long whistle at that half- naked girl well we're ducked down it makes it look like brother brandom whistled at the girl well we went on by we started laughing man we just laughing we having so much and looked up here and brother Brandon was laughing oh he said that's a good one boys that's a good one then he said boys don't you ever do that again and he wasn't laughing and we stopped laughing and I never did it again it's one of those stupid stories I was talking about um you know there's a famous story there's a famous story in the message and I'm sure many of you but probably all of you have heard it I think it took place in Germany and it might have taken place over here at Carl's Rua I don't but you would probably be able to tell me there's a famous story where brother Brandon was praying for people and a little blind girl came up and she had no eyeballs yall know was did that happen in Germany I thought it did yeah okay and uh you know the story then she was she didn't have any eyeballs and she came up before brother brandom and and I don't remember it in detail but it was something like this he said uh honey if you had eyes what color would you like and she said something about I think blue wasn't it blue yeah and so the prophet of God prayed for her and she turned around and and she had eyes God had created eyeballs for that young sister I did not see that but in about I think it was the fall of 1964 I believe it was brother brandom had come back to Jeffersonville for a meeting and there was another little girl and she was blind now she had eyeballs but she was blind and I was sitting just maybe four or five rows back and I saw very clearly what happened and she walked up her and her mother walked up before brother brandom he said oh he said the child is blind he said God bless you mother he said oh he said this precious little sister he said little sister do you believe that God can give you back your sight the mother was saying yes and the girl was saying yes he said now I want everybody in here to close your eyes he said because if you don't close your eyes he said God's going to heal her and you may have the sickness and I was sitting there and I watched that little girl turn around and she started screaming I can see I can see and the mother was screaming I saw that with my own eyes Church a man can't do that a man cannot do that it takes God to do that and I keep referring to my notes here let's see what else we got to we uh went to the Tabernacle there for a lot of years and it was always strange in the late 50s and the early 60s that I remember because late 50s and early 60s that's right because Church would start I think it started at 10:30 but in order to get a seat you had to get there about 4:30 in the morning and so you you could arrive at 5:00 and 5:30 and the crowds would be so great at at the front door and they would just be waiting to get in and uh in later years they actually reserved a seat for brother branham's family and my dad's family and we we we didn't have to wait in that line because they would save us as seat but but in in that in those first years we would get there real early and we'd have to wait in line like everybody else and then when the doors would open they'd open them usually about eight people would just rush in now you all have heard the story of brother Ben Bryant brother Ben Bryant was a big supporter of brother brandham he was a huge mountain man and uh he had brother Brandon told the story where he had been in the war and he'd gotten uh uh shrapnel I think it was shell fragments in in his head and he wasn't just wasn't quite he was a good guy just wasn't quite right though and uh he he was a big tall he must have been about six' six uh very big tall guy big guy great big guy and many times when those doors would open he would push people he would push ladies he would push little girls he didn't care he had he said I've got to be on the front seat for my prophit and that's where he ended up every time and there was many times where he couldn't be in the to get up in one of the front seats and he would actually step over the pews until he got to the front he was going to make sure he got to the front one funny little story I'm in Jeffersonville one day and this is in the 70s brother bram's done gone Ben's still there I'm downtown Jeffersonville and I see a big crowd over here in front of JC Pennies so I go over I want to see what's going on so I go over there and look and I look and there's a man down on all fours and he's barking like a dog and I look closer and it was brother Ben Bryan and he was down on all fours he started barking like a dog just a barking you know people look at him like he's weird they're about half scared of him and then he would stand up he stood up and he said 'ow that I've got your people's attention he said' I want to tell you about God sending a prophet he was dedicated wasn't he you know I just kind of walked away well that was old Ben Bryant he was a rough character I told you my family came from burksville Kentucky and I would go down in the summertime and visit my grandmother so one summer I went down to visit my grandmother and I decided that I was going to research and find a copy of brother bram's birth certificate I thought now this is you know how we do in the message this is something nobody else is God I can get this you know so I went down to the courthouse and I started searching through files and I couldn't find anything so I went to the lady at the desk and I said ma'am I said I can't find what I'm looking for and she said what are you looking for and I said I'm looking for the record of a birth uh of a man I know she goes well those kind of Records over here in the microfish file which was what they used at that time I said okay so I went over there and I looked through there and I couldn't find anything and she I went back to her and I said I I just came she said what are you looking for I said I'm looking for the man a record of birth for a man in their n uh that was born in 1909 she goes oh honey she said you won't find those records she said we had a fire here in 1921 and it burned up all those records but a little later a few years later when I heard that people were leaving the message because they didn't believe the story about the bridge you remember that I thought my God we can't even prove the man was alive what are you worrying about a bridge for but about that story about the bridge there's a lot of reasons a lot of things that can be said about why people don't find a record of that in the newspapers in the first place back in that time labor unions were very very strong and they actually controlled the Press they controlled the newspaper business and the labor unions were having problems finding people to work on the bridge because you're over 100 feet over the water and it was a very dangerous job and so there's people there that will tell you and we actually found a witness that actually saw people fall off the bridge and you've probably seen it on the voice of God website and uh but the newspapers were controlled by the labor unions and it's and I don't know this to be a fact but it's very likely they didn't want the word to get out that people had been killed working on the bridge because they would have problem getting people to do the work we don't know for sure but uh give me a minute I'm past 25 the second time I became very concerned and others did because we heard had reports of people leaving so a friend of mine he he said brother Kenny what about this he said what can we do to what can we do to turn this thing around he said you was born there he said do you remember anything about that time I said yeah I said I remember a lot I said I remember the mayor who the mayor was at that time he said 'well why don't you check around see what you can find so U I wrote a letter first I called then I wrote a letter to the Jeffersonville um city hall and I asked if that man was still alive that was mayor when brother brandom was alive and uh they responded that no that man wasn't still alive but his son was an attorney in town and so the other brother and I we contacted the attorney and he began telling the story and I I suppose most of you have seen the story um we talked to the attorney and he wrote us a letter how that his family was good friends with brother brandham and his family actually owned the Jefferson Villa Motel where many of the people stayed and he told the story about how many how that many many many sick people would come in they'd be on cots or stretchers they'd be sick and they'd come into the motel and they they'd go to the meetings and they'd come back and they weren't sick anymore and they knew that this was a man of God and uh so then he told the story about back in that day he remembers his grandmother talking about them building that bridge and he said his grandmother and another woman would go down and sit on the river bank and and watch the bridge being built because there was nothing else to do in that day they didn't have TV and and there just wasn't much going on in Jeffersonville I don't think there's a whole lot going on now but but he said Grandma and her friend would go down and sit on the riverbank and watch the bridge being built and he said they were down there one day and they saw some men fall off that bridge and they went in the concrete that had been poured you couldn't say there's no way they could ever recover him said they saw that so he said yes he said that's true that's true Mr caps he said if Billy he called him Billy he said if Billy brandham says that he said that's true that's exactly right but people because they can't prove something because you can't prove something don't mean it's not true I can't prove the man was alive but that don't mean it's not true but that's one of the little stories that we get into sometimes you know how it is people think they know better than a prophet what time is somebody tell me what time is lunch or dinner one hour okay let me tell you because this takes just a little while let me tell you about the time I first met brother brandham now this is a funny story George has heard it many times I believe it was 1965 I think it was and and uh as you know brother brandom went out west in the fall and he would after after school uh let out out in Arizona he would bring the family back to Jeffersonville well that year they he brought the family back to Jeffersonville now you know we had all these kids around Jeffersonville there and we'd all go to the Tabernacle we were friends and and sometimes we'd have little boyfriends and girlfriends you know nothing serious just friendships you know but one day my buddy Frankie Neville brother Neville's son he brings me a note and this note has written on it dear Kenny I like you do you like me and there was two little boxes there one you could check yes and one you could check [Applause] no he said here he said uh Sarah brandham gave this to Ruth Collins to give to me to give to you he said what are you going to do with it I said I don't know he said do you like her I said well I guess he said check yes so I checked yes and I gave it back to him and he gave it back to Ruth Collins and she gave it back to Sarah Brandon so I guess we were official friends then you know and uh so this went on I didn't you know I didn't get any more notes for a while and next thing I know my friend Frankie Neville he comes to me and he says Kenny Sarah wants to go out with you I'm pretty dumb I didn't know what going out was you know I said what she wants to go out with you I said 'what's that mean he saidwell she wants to go somewhere with you I said why she wants to spend time with you I said how would we do that he said she told me she would take care of it so the next thing I know Charlie brandham comes to me now you you may not know who Charlie brother brenham's brother was Doc brandham he was the uh Sunday school superintendent of the church and he was the uh custodian of the church and he had two boys he had one boy named Charlie and one one boy named Mike well Charlie was three years older than I am now I'm I'm only 15 Charlie's three years older he's he's 18 he's got a car he's got a girlfriend so Charlie comes to me he said Kenny you know Sarah wants to go out with you and I said yeah I heard that he saidou going to go and I go I don't know he said you ought to go he said look Sarah said you you two can go with me and Linda and and we'll go out and eat or something he said are you going to go and I go I don't know I was a little nervous about it you know and he said oh go ahead and go I said all right I'll go I'll go you know and he said 'well I'll set it up I said ' okay so he comes back a week later and he says hey Kenny he said if you go out with Sarah you got to meet with brother brandom or he called him Uncle Bill you've got to go see Uncle Bill and have a meeting with Uncle Bill I said that did that's it I ain't going nope nope not me I said I ain't going he said no you got to go she wants to go and I said I ain't going not doing it and let me tell you why I didn't tell him but you see as a kid we weren't allowed to have comic books in our house but I would sneak away and I would go to the corner drugstore and I'd stand there on Saturday morning read the comic books I'd read about Superman and all those Heroes you know but I always knew that brother Brandon was the real Superman and I'm tell you something my parents gave me 50 cents a day for lunch half a dollar man we could eat good back then and I would take that 50 cents and I'd go to school and I'd gamble with the boys I gambled my money man there was many days I'd go home with three or four dollars there was many days I didn't get to eat [Laughter] lunch and you know what I was telling little stories that wasn't too nice at school I knew that if brother brandom came close to me he would know everything about me and I ain't going he said I mean they tried for two weeks said you come on you can go it's all right just talk to Uncle Bill I said I'm not going I can't do it I don't want to meet him finally finally after about two weeks two and a half weeks they convinced me brother or Charlie came to me and he said listen Kenny he said I've talked with Uncle Bill he said you don't have to meet Uncle Bill he said but now will you go out Sarah wants to go out they're only going to be here for the summer he said will you go out with her I said ' if I don't have to meet brother brandham I'll go out he said all right I'll set it up so I guess he got everything set up he he called me he said Friday night he said now his girlfriend lived out of town he said I'll pick you up I only live two miles from brother brandom he said I'll pick you up we'll go to brother brandom's or Uncle Bill's house and we'll get get Sarah and we will uh then go get my girlfriend Linda he said is that all right can you do that I said okay sounds good you know we got a plan right so Charlie comes and picks me up now Charlie has got a 59 olmo Bill and a 59 Oldsmobile is about as long as that wall right there and uh it was summertime the windows were down the birds were singing and he picked me up and we drove to Brother brandom's house and I started to get real nervous I really started to get nervous I said maybe this wasn't a good idea he said too late now he pulled into brother brandom's driveway and he sat there and I sat there and I sat there he said you got to go to the door and get her I said I got to go get her he said yes you got to go knock on the door and get her I said Charlie can't you do it can't you honk the horn can't you do something he goes no Kenny you got to go that's what guys do when they go out with the girls I'd never been out with the girls I didn't know you know and uh he said you got to go well I got out of the car and I walked up to the brother vandam's door and I stood there for just a minute or two and I want to tell you brother something this is now this is a gospel truth I was so scared my knees were shaking I could hear them and I was trying to think of every way not to go ahead and go through this finally I got enough courage walk it up knocked on the door and I'm just I'm petrified because I just know brother Brandon's going to come to the door but he doesn't sister brandom comes to the door she opens the door she goes oh hello Kenny good to see you she come on in she Sarah have a seat said Sarah's upstairs she'll be ready in a minute she'll be down have a seat listen I didn't want a seat I wanted to get in and get out uh I've told this to young people all over the world so I'm sure you young people enjoy this I didn't want to see it I was just wanted to get out of there but I had to sit there and the whole time I sat there I'm looking around and I'm thinking where's he at where's he at you know but he didn't come man Sarah come down oh she's beautiful you know so sister brandom gave us our instructions you know and so we went out the door and went and got in the car I was feeling pretty good now you know I I I put Sarah in the front seat between Charlie and I and uh so we're ready to go I'm feeling good now so Charlie backs out of the driveway and he starts down the street now remember I told you there's an empty field between Brother bram's house and brother Banks Wood's house so he starts down the street and as we get in front of that empty field I see brother banham back here here with banks wood and they've got guns and about that time about that time brother random screams out hey Charlie wait a minute wait a minute I go Charlie go [Applause] go Charlie said no it's Uncle Bill we got to stop it's Uncle Bill I said Charlie can't you go on Sarah said Charlie why don't you go on I said go on Charlie no no it's Uncle Bill we got to stop if Uncle Bill says stop we got to stop oh it seemed like an eternity brother brandom and Banks wood starts walking up to the car from this field it seemed like it took forever and I'm sitting by the passenger door and that's the side he walks up to didn't have a shirt on big old hairy chest You' ever seen him without a shirt he's just a big old hairy chest guy he had that little old hat he always wore really dirty and everything banks walked up and he had his gun and brother brandom had his gun I'm going what is going on here you know and he sticks his hand in the window to shake my hand man and I'm this far from his face now brother Bisal said something the other day about in his presence in the presence of brother brandom I don't know if it was because I was in his presence I don't know if it because I scared to death I don't know what but when he shook my hand he goes how you doing boy well he didn't have to say it so loud you know sound like a mean man you know how you doing boy like I said I don't know if it's scared or if it's his presence I tried to speak and I couldn't speak nothing comes out I'm trying my hardest to sound like a sensible human being and nothing comes out and I I feel feel it really bad you know and he took my hand and held it for a minute and he looked in my eyes and you know how they they talked about his eyes getting narrow and I looked in his eyes and there was those lights in his eyes and I saw the eyes of an eagle I had been to the Cincinnati Zoo where he saw those Eagles and talked about the eyes of the eagle I had been there and seen those Eagles and to me he had the eyes of an eagle that's all I could think of his eagle eyes and there's something that came over me brother I don't know what it was but it was that presence I'm sure but something came over me as a 15-year-old boy I knew he knew everything about me and I felt so bad and I'm still haven't said anything and he said uh still holding my hand he says where you taking her boy nothing comes out is oh so this is that caps boy I've been hearing so much about you know I should have said yes sir you know or something you know I couldn't say nothing he asked me again he said where are you taking boy well Charlie's getting kind of tired of all this he said oh Uncle Bill leave him alone he said we're going to go we're going to go play Miniature Golf and then we're going to go out to eat we'll be home in a little bit so brother brandom says oh that's fine that's real fine he shook my hand again he said you kids have a good time I still can't say a word and of course he knows you know he knows the situation you and so he starts to turn him and Banks start to turn away from the car and I'm starting to feel a little relieved I feel bad because I haven't said anything but I'm starting to feel a little relieved but then he turns back around toward the car window and this time he takes his gun his rifle or whatever it was and he puts it he puts it through the window and he lays the barrel of that gun on the back of my neck and he says in a real rough voice he says you are going to bring her back tonight aren't you you boy gun on your back man talking to you like that I finally found my voice but it was about 10 octaves too high I said yes sir yes [Applause] sir he laughed and he laughed and he laughed he slapped his leg he said I got him Banks I got him Banks said you got him bill you got him that was my first time to to meet the prophet so several times after that that summer I would get my parents to take me to their house and Sarah and I would have it set up that me and her would would see each other right but every time I got there sister random would have something else for Sarah to do she she'd always say no you just go in the backyard and play with Joseph Sarah's got a work to do I never got to and then many times I'd stay a couple hours and be out in the back with Joseph and uh then it would they'd have to go somewhere he said uh brother BR say uh Kenny can I take you home he said are we can call your mom I said no you can take me home you know he'd put me in the car and he joke with me all the way to my house only about two miles he'd joke with me tell me jokes and say funny things you know just a common good good guy you know made me feel so good and uh but that was that was that summer was my first time to meet brother random face to face I got to be in their home a little bit be with the family just a little bit not quite like George Smith but uh now I treasure those times and I've had people tell me I had a brother tell me just out here the yesterday I think it was he said you know some of us would give our right arm if we could just meet the man you know and I understand that now but at that time I didn't I wasn't comprehending fully I knew who he was but I didn't have a revelation of who he was and I'm thankful to God that as I got older and God dealt with me that I got a revelation of who he was and of these things that I'd say let me tell you one other story about court I just it's a little story about brother George's son I hope he doesn't mind there's a message and I I I had one time I had it wrote down I don't have it with me I don't remember when it was exactly but brother random talked about uh I think he talked about when when he no when his when his father courted his mother he did so by horse and buggy youall know courted that means dated you know when his father courted his mother he did so by horse and buggy he said now when I when I courted my wife I did so by I think it was a Model A Ford one of those Fords model a Model T or something he said uh now when my son Billy courted his wife he did so with the fancy new sports car he said now this is what brother Bram said he said I suppose Someday my grandson will Court his wife by jet airplane now we are finding out more and more all the time that even the little things that the man of God said are coming to pass in this generation and I believe it has to be that because he said I'm as one born out of season to you Pentecostal people and I believe this is the season he was born for these are the times and we see many of those prophecies and many of those things he said coming to pass is that right but he said I suppose Someday my grandson will Court his wife by jet airplane and brother George's son he had a son his name was William they called him will we call him will today will was like a young a lot he was like a lot of young people around the message in American I'm sure here you know people young people have been brought up in message churches and uh they become interested in the other gender which is quite a blessing in this day and will I suppose was like all the other young people you know we we man listen I remember when I was single I would go to Every meeting I could I only worked enough to get enough gas G money to go to the next meeting and yeah I was there for the spiritual food and the spiritual benefit I loved it but I also had one eye open in fact I had one eye open at Tim Prince Youth Camp one year I had one eye open down at his Youth Camp I was a counselor and there was a little girl there that was a camper and she caught that one eye that was open but to continue with my story so will was like a lot of the young people he would go to different meetings and so forth now George at that time they lived in Tucson Arizona it's where will lived and somewhere along the line he was in a meeting I believe it was in mon Georgia and he met a girl which was Jack Palmer's granddaughter and uh you know you're just young people you meet people right I got to tell you I got to stop this and tell you stand up see this young man here we was in Youth Camp in Romania two years ago no no no stand up and so we decided to go on a little uh little Adventure away from the youth camp and so we were going to the where were we going to the salt mines where we going some sort of salt salt mine yes yeah we were going to a big attraction which is a salt mine there in in Romania they've got Carousel rides and everything there and so we were all it was it was a couple hours away and we were all just we were all going in different cars you know and I think I was riding with brother Gabriel and back here and this young man he had his own car and we were all kind of trying to stay together you know and he must have had a nice car I don't remember but he would come he would be behind us and he would come real fast and pass us and he'd go way down the road and a little while he'd slow down again and we'd catch up to him and he'd take off and go real fast again and we wouldn't see him for a while and pretty soon he did it again he'd slow down and he'd take off and go real fast it's all right if I'm embarass you yeah and so we he was he had passed us and we were going down the road and looked up there and there was a policeman that had a car pulled over and it was our brother now you can sit down but he had some girls in the car and I think some of those girls are here too aren't they yeah but you know message young people they can be normal young people you know all right back to brother will so and I'm just I don't know all the details but I just know how it ended up okay and so will became friends with her name's ranell right George ryell Palmer yeah Will became friends with ryell Palmer and uh from what I can gather they became friends and then they became better friends and then they became better friends and they became better friends and the next thing you know they were in love well there was a problem will lived in Tucson Arizona she lived in mon Georgia there's almost 2,000 miles between those two cities what are we going to do but you know them Smith boys they got a little bit on the ball pretty smart will got a job working with American Airlines and I don't know how it is now but I think back at that time if you worked for American Airlines you could fly free and from what I understand and I may be I think it's right from what I understand will would work all week long at American Airlines and then come the weekend he would hop a free jet ride to make in Georgia and where they had a little courtship with him and his his girlfriend his engageed or his his fiance and he eventually married this girl and they're living in Johnson City Tennessee today and thereby fulfilling the prophecy where the prophet of God said Someday I Suppose my grandson will Court his wife by jet airplane and we got to move along I just kind of cut this short here in 1963 after the seals were preached the crowds became so great at the brandham Tabernacle we would have the young people sitting on the altar in the front of the the pews we would have people sitting in the baptistry we would have people sitting in the Sunday School rooms we'd have people everywhere there was people standing along the wall sometimes there would be three and four people deep and it was such a a glorious thing to see that you know these were long sermons that brother Brandon priest and a lot of times you could see a brother get up and and another brother would sit down for a while and he would get up and give his seat uh really really Christian attitudes and uh but the the crowds were were just so great and one one day my father came home and he he said I was in a meeting today with brother brandom and the deacons and he said they asked that all the that that all the young men 13 years of age and older give up their seat 12 years of age and older I think all the young men 12 years of age and older give up their seats that somebody from out of town or across the out of the country could have a seat to sit and listen to the prophet he said and they said you young people uh can go out in the car and listen to it on the radio because they had the radio broadcast and there would be there would be 500 600 people sitting in cars listening to the message on the car radio because they couldn't get in the church he said now you just tell your your boys to to go out and and and uh sit in the car and and listen to it on the radio and uh so Mom and Dad decided that I was old enough and mature enough to give up my seat and go out and listen to the message on the car radio so I gave up my seat for somebody else now we would go out and sit in the car and probably for the first 15 20 minutes half hour we would listen to the message then we would get sidetracked we'd get to talking and we'd get walk into the gas station and buy Coca-Cola and we didn't always listen to the message like we would have if we were inside the church so one day father come home and he said Kenny I want to tell you something he said we were in a meeting with brother brandham and he said uh he wasn't in the original meeting this is something the deacons did and the trustees did when brother Brandon was out of town he said we were in a meeting with brother brandham and the deacons told him what they had done how they had asked the young men 12 years of age and older to give up their seat so we'd have more seating for people and he said when the he said I was in that meeting he said when they told Brother brandom that he said brother brandom kind of looked up for a minute and then he looked back and he said God will bless those boys for that someday now if a prophet of God says that his grandson will Court by jet airplane it's going to come to pass prophet of God says God will bless those boys for that I stand before you as a spoken word blessing of a prophet of God I have been tremendously blessed traveling across the world you know I always had a desire to travel see the world our family was not wealthy but um I that was the desire of my heart to travel so when I started preaching the word offers started coming fund started coming by God's grace I've been to over 50 countries God has given me the desire my heart but that's not the end of the [Applause] story brother brandom died as as we know in 1965 after a while my father left Jeffersonville and went and started another church I finished high school I got a job had my own money got me a nice sports car had my own sports car I had a 65 Ford Mustang you all don't know what that is but if you're in America you know what that is that's a car that's got an engine that's got a four-speed transmission it's got uh it's it's jacked up real high it's got sport wheels on it it's a real car I thought I was pretty hot I had my own job had my own car had my own money and I decided that I didn't need church anymore I quit church I started running with a rough crowd a wild crowd you see I didn't need church anymore in my mind I'll tell you why growing up our family went to church at the brandham Tabernacle every Sunday morning and every Sunday night my father was a minister they used to have what they call Cottage prayer meetings house meetings and on Monday night brother Neville the pastor he would preach at a house meeting a cottage prayer meeting and my dad would always take the family and go and be the song leader for him well then the next night was Tuesday night my father preached at a house meeting a cottage prayer meeting and brother Neville would go and Lead songs for him on Wednesday night we were back at the brandham Tabernacle on Thursday night Dad took the family and we go over to Junior Jackson's Church on Friday night they had a men's meeting at Brother Don rutles church and me being the oldest son I always had to go with my dad to the men's meeting now Saturday night I didn't have to go to church unless dad was preaching a Revival somewhere and then I had to go to church Saturday night so I was for years I was in church every night so when I got to be 18 got my own car and my own money my own job I thought you know I've had enough of church I'm a big boy now I don't need church anymore I've had enough Church to last me for my life I quit church I met a little girl that was not a Christian now I want you young people to listen this is the serious part I met a young lady that was not a Christian and I started dating her and we got married I was at in church she didn't know anything about church and I got married I was about I was 18 I was about ready to turn 19 she was she was 17 we got married I left home had my own place my own job I had everything I didn't need nothing from nobody I was doing good good I thought in time we had two little boys married for about four years a little boy three and little boy two one Sunday night when I wasn't in church there came a knock at my door it was a police officer he said sir are you Mr caps I said yes sir he said I'm sorry to inform you your wife has been killed in an automobile accident what was I going to do do I had a little boy three a little boy two at the time's 22 years old young people you were raised in a in a Godly home I know you was you're reason you're here God put you in that home for a reason listen to your parents listen to your pastors God has never left a one of his own he's never lost one of his and if you're a child of God God's going to get you you can come hard or you can come easy say maybe maybe some other kid can do those things and nothing happens but you're a child of God God will get your attention one way or another God will get your attention young people being a single parent is the hardest job in the world you don't want to go through it if you don't have to but I stayed single and I raised those two boys they're alive today one of them's uh 47 one of them's 46 living up in Indiana I've got uh three grandchildren I've got one great grandchild but it's something you don't want to go through if God allowed you to be raised in a Christian Home a message home it's for a reason God doesn't do anything out of order life was hard life was hard working a full-time job getting up early in the morning before I go to work and take the children to my mom's house or whatever whoever was taking care of them getting off work late going picking up the children giving them a bath giving them everything they need giving them dinner and then this next day the same thing over and over again you know I had a lot of time to think life was really hard but you know I was raised in the brandham Tabernacle I knew the prophet I was in his home I'd never given my heart to the Lord I believe we've got young people here you've been raised in a message home you go to a church a message church and maybe you've never given your heart to the Lord I hope that's not the case but I suspect that it is and one night on Sunday night an Indiana cornfield I walked about three miles from my house and I walked out into the cornfield the corn was high it was over my head and I said Lord Jesus I I I'm sorry I've never asked you to come into my life but if you'll come into my life I'll live for you I'll serve you the rest of my life I walked home that night I didn't speak in tongues I didn't shout I didn't sing I just walked home that night and went to bed but the next morning when I got up there was something in me that told me that for the first time in my life God had heard my prayer and young people when you get serious with God you'll know that you've heard from God I got up that next morning and I felt so different I thought he's heard my prayer he's done what I asked him to do and then it became a miss mission for me to start studying God's word I studied it day and night I studied these books and listen to these tapes day and night I got back into a message church first church I went to Brother colen BR was brother Ed hunter in M Indiana you know him God began to deal with my heart I learned how to praise God listen what I told you this afternoon or this morning it's not just a story it's not just something to make you feel good it's not just something to cause a a lot of emotion it's true if you will praise God you say brother Ken are you sure I'm sure it happened to me just praise God you don't have to be a big fantastic thing but just praise God in your own way you need the Holy Ghost amen you can't make it in this world without the Holy Ghost you might have made it 50 years ago but you're not going to make it in this world without the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost we've got tonight we've got a service tomorrow morning is that correct tomorrow afternoon and then tomorrow night right tomorrow morning and tomorrow evening and tonight right we've got three services left young people I challenge you don't leave this convention without making sure that you've made everything right with God you don't have to you don't know that you have tomorrow we don't know I'm not trying to scare you I'm just telling you the facts because I've been there I know what I'm talking about don't let this convention pass without you receiving what you have need of from God you know as God started to deal with me I began to think back on all the things I've seen and heard and I remembered what my dad told me that night he said brother Brenham said God will bless those boys for that someday God started blessing me I don't understand it I don't deserve it but he has blessed me and blessed me and blessed me stayed single for 21 years God blessed me with a wonderful wife God blessed me with another little boy boy he's 14 years old I believe he needs the Holy Ghost y'all pray for him but the thing is I gave up my seat I just did something for God I just sacrificed something for God and God honored it young people find something you can do for God find somehow you can make a sacrifice for God and God will bless you you don't need a prophet of God telling you the word of God tells you your pastor tell you do something for God God will bless you if you do sorry I've taken for so long I didn't mean to I've got other things but we need to we need to call it to an end let me pray as our song leader comes father we approach you
