[39:29] it means and how we interact with the
[39:31] presence of God and what happens when we
[39:34] could recognize and acknowledge the
[39:35] presence of God
[39:37] and I want to say that the presence of
[39:39] God causes things to happen
[39:41] you can't enter the presence of God and
[39:43] experience the presence of God and and
[39:45] come back out the same way once you go
[39:48] into the presence of God something has
[39:50] to change you can't be the same you may
[39:53] have come here in a particular way but
[39:56] once you experience that presence there
[39:58] is no way you could walk out the same
[40:00] way
[40:01] once said he said you know sometimes you
[40:04] come to church and when you leave you're
[40:06] either better or worse but you can't
[40:09] remain the same way and his presence is
[40:12] so powerful the presence of God is so
[40:14] awesome and amazing it has some such
[40:17] fantastic attributes now tonight I want
[40:19] to delve into it a little bit and show
[40:21] and prove and realize and recognize that
[40:24] if we could only get into that presence
[40:28] and recognize the presence of God all
[40:31] things are possible there is nothing
[40:34] that's going to stand before you and
[40:35] your faith
[40:37] amen
[40:39] so I wondered why would would it be so
[40:43] important for David to see he said cast
[40:46] me not away from your presence no matter
[40:48] what he was going through it was so
[40:50] important to him that he said you know
[40:52] create me a clean heart and renew a
[40:54] right spirit in me the next line said in
[40:57] verse 11 he said cast me not away from
[41:00] thy presence and take not thy Holy
[41:03] Spirit from me so he saw it
[41:05] having a great level of importance it
[41:08] was meaningful to him because he
[41:10] understood what the presence of the Lord
[41:12] meant it wasn't just something to say it
[41:14] wasn't just a a nice tagline some
[41:17] something that sounded good but it was
[41:19] very very important to him and
[41:22] in light of that
[41:25] for us in for a sub a subject I say it
[41:29] changes everything
[41:31] there's nothing that could remain the
[41:32] same so I want to look at recognizing
[41:35] his presence for a little bit
[41:37] and
[41:39] brother Branham in a message bid pins
[41:42] paragraph 29 you say Divine Healing is
[41:45] minor in the gospel he said you could
[41:47] never measure on a minor anyone knows
[41:49] that
[41:50] but it's bits it's used to get people to
[41:53] believe in the Supernatural presence or
[41:56] God the Supernatural is present and then
[41:59] by that if they can recognize his
[42:01] presence then they are healed see by
[42:04] faith believe it
[42:07] so when you recognize whose presence you
[42:09] are in your attitude changes
[42:13] you know in a natural sense if you
[42:14] realize you're somewhere and you see
[42:16] somebody that you deem of a high level
[42:18] of importance walks in you're kind of
[42:21] and adjust yourself a little bit you
[42:23] probably fix your clothes you want to
[42:24] look right you want to stand up straight
[42:26] you want to give them that level of
[42:28] respect because you realize that person
[42:30] is deemed to have a great level of
[42:32] importance now just think for a second
[42:34] that's what we do in the natural in the
[42:36] spiritual when you consider the presence
[42:38] of almighty God
[42:40] what would your attitude be like if you
[42:42] could just understand and recognize that
[42:44] that right now in the presence of God
[42:48] how much more would you worship if you
[42:51] knew in the presence of God
[42:54] how sincere would you be how open and
[42:57] honest and transparent and vulnerable
[42:59] you'll be if you know you're in the
[43:00] presence of God
[43:02] so I said when you recognize whose
[43:04] presence you're in your attitude will
[43:06] change and your mindset will be
[43:07] different it's no longer a going because
[43:10] no
[43:12] because I'm in the presence of God
[43:15] it's so important to me that I have to
[43:17] act right I have to live right I have to
[43:19] to do right
[43:21] because you give it or it's deemed to
[43:24] have that level of importance amen
[43:26] now with your mindset different your
[43:29] perspective your approach everything
[43:31] will change the way you see yourself
[43:33] will change because you understand that
[43:36] this is not easy going every day
[43:39] Everything is Everything no but I'm now
[43:41] in the presence of God and I know in the
[43:44] presence of the of God Anything is
[43:46] Possible
[43:48] my faith could could lock onto anything
[43:51] right now because with the presence of
[43:53] God it's not just we alignment on the
[43:55] road I'll be talking and laughing
[43:58] once you recognize you're in the
[44:01] presence of God
[44:02] all your trials that's a lot different
[44:03] you know all your challenges only
[44:06] difficulties only mind battles all these
[44:08] things that you think are obstacles and
[44:10] and it's big and you don't know how to
[44:12] wrap your mind around this In God's
[44:14] Presence it becomes so small so mind you
[44:16] it's so little because you realize he is
[44:19] so great
[44:20] he bigger than all that and his presence
[44:22] is all encompassing it kind of surrounds
[44:25] us and surrounds you he fills you with
[44:27] your love with his love with his Holy
[44:29] Spirit and you realize that I am nothing
[44:31] and he still worries me I'm undone what
[44:34] I could do because I'm the presence of
[44:36] such a holy God Amen
[44:40] like the woman with the blood issue
[44:44] all them people passing by and all of
[44:47] them standing up saying there goes the
[44:49] rabbi that's that's the guy that claims
[44:51] to be a prophet that's a fanatic and all
[44:54] such as that but what happened this
[44:56] little woman had an issue of blood
[45:00] and she had heard about him and when she
[45:02] came down there regardless of what
[45:04] anybody said she recognized what I would
[45:07] understood and she recognized who he was
[45:11] and she said if I could only touch His
[45:13] Garment you know the story
[45:15] see
[45:17] if I can only touch His Garment
[45:24] and when that genuine fit in God became
[45:27] a positive thing to her what did it
[45:28] release
[45:29] it released his power to heal her it
[45:33] touched him in such a way he turned
[45:34] around and told her what was wrong with
[45:36] her said your faith had saved you what
[45:39] did faith
[45:41] others and India might have been sicker
[45:43] than she was
[45:45] people are wrong you your neighbors your
[45:46] co-workers your friends your loved ones
[45:48] they may have more challenges and more
[45:50] problems than you but because you could
[45:52] recognize
[45:54] the presence that you're standing
[45:56] you realize your faith have a different
[45:59] kind of talking technology your faith
[46:02] could call out right now once more
[46:04] despite what the doctors say which
[46:07] reminds me and I just want to touch this
[46:09] briefly I don't know how many of you
[46:10] could remember there was a prayer
[46:11] request Sunday versus the popwell
[46:15] and I sat and I remembered it very very
[46:17] clearly the prayer request said
[46:19] from husband you know he prayed that
[46:22] they wouldn't have to do any operation
[46:25] any surgery
[46:27] and when I saw the message today I said
[46:29] you know surgery was scheduled and then
[46:32] the other message that came and said it
[46:33] wasn't necessary I say look at God he
[46:36] just liked to show off
[46:37] that was exact he didn't pray that she
[46:39] go through it you know with little pain
[46:42] or discomfort
[46:44] pray that she didn't have to undergo the
[46:46] surgery and and the doctors came and
[46:49] said listen we believe this could take
[46:51] care of itself
[46:52] the God we serve is so amazing that we
[46:54] can see it right in front of us
[46:59] I mean
[47:01] talk about Jesus Christ the same
[47:02] yesterday today and forever that's
[47:04] present tense as present tense as you
[47:06] could get
[47:06] no Jesus said your faith has saved you
[47:09] what did Faith understanding there may
[47:11] have been sicker than she but see she
[47:14] recognized his presence she knew that
[47:16] was her opportunity if we could only do
[47:19] that tonight people this brother Brandon
[47:21] was speaking if we could only realize
[47:22] that he is appearing to us in these
[47:24] meetings for one purpose that's to
[47:27] release our desires that we have in him
[47:30] to us
[47:31] what we've got to recognize his presence
[47:34] is a common theme we need to recognize
[47:36] it we can't just exist and we don't know
[47:38] he's passing by right now and we don't
[47:41] reach out we have to recognize his
[47:44] presence his presence is when the
[47:46] promised word for this age is made
[47:49] manifest because he asked how do you
[47:51] recognize it when the promised word for
[47:54] this age is made manifest not the
[47:57] promise word for Moses age or any other
[47:59] Age The Promised word for this age now
[48:01] that's in a message called the presence
[48:04] of God unrecognized
[48:07] those things
[48:09] but you know today we have so many
[48:11] distractions we have so many things as a
[48:13] matter of fact
[48:14] in that message as the Eagles stirth he
[48:17] said you know some something
[48:19] you see I don't want to school here
[48:21] he said but I want you to know one thing
[48:23] we got too much television in our lives
[48:26] I don't know why I'm saying this tonight
[48:27] I just think it needs to be said we have
[48:29] too much television in our lives we want
[48:31] entertainment
[48:33] say God is not showing these things to
[48:36] entertain you is not to say you know
[48:37] somebody get healed as a good story that
[48:39] song was awesome
[48:41] we want you to recognize his presence
[48:43] that he's a present tense God that his
[48:46] presence is here right now that you
[48:48] could be filled today
[48:49] you do have to wait till tomorrow for
[48:51] your scenario to change when you go back
[48:53] home your situation could be different
[48:56] because he is just that kind of God but
[48:59] we have so many distractions we like to
[49:01] be entertained we like good stories we
[49:03] like to to talk about stuff to be cool
[49:06] Television Internet whatever is it
[49:09] distracts us from sometimes recognizing
[49:12] that gorgeous weaving right here a
[49:14] little flag a still Small Voice trying
[49:16] to speak to you but you're not hearing
[49:18] it because you're too busy too
[49:20] distracted by all the noise around
[49:23] you know I want to move forward a little
[49:26] bit
[49:27] so somebody attributes of his presence
[49:29] because I think if we understand
[49:32] just that phrase
[49:34] the presence of the Lord the presence of
[49:37] God if we could understand how powerful
[49:40] that is
[49:41] right then we will look at everything
[49:42] different we will speak different we
[49:45] will pray different we will operate the
[49:47] front because we know it's not a natural
[49:49] thing it's not just a hope and a prayer
[49:52] no we have such a faith and such of an
[49:54] assurance that he is here that he is a
[49:57] reward of them that diligently seek him
[49:59] then the very words we speak will have a
[50:03] certain power behind it we'll have a
[50:06] certain kind of knock we're not just
[50:07] Lord Lord open open the door
[50:11] we don't want to just search because he
[50:13] says sick and you shall find knock on
[50:15] the door will be opened you know so who
[50:17] when we have that kind of fervent
[50:19] effectual prayer and we pong as we know
[50:22] in his presence this thing has to happen
[50:25] tonight then nothing could stop us
[50:30] in the message a hidden life in Christ
[50:32] cargraph 18. he said now in the Old
[50:35] Testament
[50:36] there was what we call the outer courts
[50:38] we watch what was in the outer Court
[50:40] then there was a holy place or the first
[50:43] Veil and then inside the holiest of
[50:44] holies
[50:46] and what furniture was in the outer
[50:48] Court what was in the unveil the holy
[50:51] place and what was in the holy of holies
[50:54] now we're going to speak tonight on the
[50:56] holiest of holies the dwelling place
[50:58] where God himself dwells
[51:01] damn Daisy dwelt in his Tabernacle and
[51:03] today he dwells in you as his Tabernacle
[51:06] but we must make this place a dwelling
[51:08] not an outer Court place or the first
[51:11] holy place but we must live with God in
[51:14] the holiest of holies are consecrated
[51:16] hidden life alone quiet with God
[51:20] and here's what he said he said we
[51:22] become too excited
[51:24] upsets about too many things and in this
[51:27] day we say stressed out things bothering
[51:29] us all the time we can hardly think
[51:31] straight but he said we do too much too
[51:33] much of this
[51:36] it shows there's something like in
[51:39] the church ought to be a million miles
[51:41] up the road to what it is now we still
[51:44] back down in the Adolescent age fussing
[51:47] and fighting and quarreling and stewing
[51:49] when we ought to be consecrated hit away
[51:52] in the holiest of holies with God it's
[51:54] better that we come easy take our time
[51:57] see where we're going now and just like
[52:00] God living on those three courts he
[52:01] surely lives in the court of the
[52:03] congregation he lived you know here in
[52:06] the Holy place but his Abiding Place
[52:07] this was just attributes of his presence
[52:11] from the holiest of holies you know and
[52:13] when you think attributes one of the
[52:16] first I could think of is in Psalms
[52:18] psalm 16 11. when you say thou will show
[52:21] me that part of life
[52:23] in thy presence and you know a scripture
[52:25] there is fullness of joy
[52:29] at thy right hand there are Pleasures
[52:30] forevermore
[52:32] so it means his presence is not a not a
[52:34] bad thing you know you want to be there
[52:37] how many want your joy to be full to
[52:39] have fullness of joy you have Liberty to
[52:42] worship and to praise know when you're
[52:45] in his presence this is not because
[52:47] Cricket going on you know tkr win no
[52:50] this is because you're in the presence
[52:52] of God look at bask in his presence I
[52:55] know yeah the joy of the Lord is your
[52:57] strength
[52:59] there's healing in his presence
[53:02] there's healing in this presence often
[53:04] times you would see those he killing
[53:06] lines where brother Brown would say
[53:07] listen that's just the presence of God
[53:10] but once you step into the presence of
[53:13] God you don't just walk back out you
[53:14] know you don't just come for it's not at
[53:16] all it's not a guided tour come any
[53:19] presents and feel your presence and walk
[53:21] out no you come any presence because you
[53:22] want to change and you will leave
[53:24] changed yeah
[53:26] there is power in his presence in Psalm
[53:29] 68 8 he said listen listen he said the
[53:32] Earth shook the heavens also dropped at
[53:36] the presence of God even Sinai itself
[53:39] was moved at the presence of God God of
[53:42] Israel
[53:43] so yes fullness of joy right but listen
[53:46] for transgressors for unbelief for sin
[53:50] for doubt is a shaken time the presence
[53:53] of God is Judgment unto them you know so
[53:56] you have to choose if you want to be on
[53:58] the side of joy and healing and power
[54:01] and strength
[54:03] deliverance and the presence of God too
[54:05] you just have to reach in the presence
[54:08] of God and you can see bands broken you
[54:12] could see chains loose
[54:14] in the presence of God
[54:16] in the presence of God listen even the
[54:19] weak they say they're strong
[54:22] there is strength in his presence
[54:25] you might be weak on the outside but in
[54:27] his presence
[54:29] you're like Samson the kind of strength
[54:32] is unparalleled it's paradoxical you
[54:35] can't even conceptualize or imagine this
[54:38] kind of strength this kind of power
[54:41] listen in his presence is life
[54:44] life forever more
[54:46] listen you know some folks says One Life
[54:48] to Live listen in his presence is where
[54:51] you have true life you have real life
[54:54] that's where you could live live in the
[54:56] presence of the almighty God
[54:59] also say in his presence there's Clarity
[55:01] is the reason why on the platform by the
[55:04] problem continue to answer the sun your
[55:05] name is so
[55:06] you live so you're suffering from Soul
[55:09] your father is so it's so clear it's so
[55:12] transparent there's no secrets in his
[55:14] presence in his presence everything
[55:16] become illuminated everything becomes
[55:19] bold everything becomes clear
[55:22] and it sounds like his presence is a
[55:25] great place to be amen that's where you
[55:28] want to be that's where we want to be
[55:31] but we know how these things go as great
[55:34] as it sounds
[55:35] there's always somebody look contrary
[55:40] while it sounds great somebody always
[55:42] want to duck the presents a little bit
[55:44] run from the presence a little bit
[55:45] disappear from the presence and we know
[55:47] it
[55:49] yeah there are times there's certain
[55:50] church and you dock any presents
[55:53] a time just stay home
[55:55] and and you call it you're taking a rest
[55:57] your back slitting a little bit but
[55:58] you're duck any presents you're doing
[56:00] the presence exposure
[56:02] so you're just running a little bit so I
[56:04] just want to touch on
[56:06] scenarios of people who run from the
[56:08] presence yeah
[56:10] from the beginning and I like examples
[56:12] in the beginning
[56:14] because they say nothing is strange to
[56:16] man nothing is foreign nothing is is is
[56:19] is new you know so in the Book of
[56:22] Genesis
[56:23] chapter 3 verse 8. and they say and they
[56:26] heard listen to this the voice of the
[56:29] Lord God Walking In The Garden in the
[56:32] cool of the day
[56:33] so this is Adam and Eve they heard he
[56:36] was walking they heard
[56:39] the voice of the Lord God walking in the
[56:42] garden
[56:43] the cool of the day and Adam and his
[56:46] wife hid themselves
[56:49] not from God you know
[56:51] from the presence of the Lord God
[56:53] amongst the Trees of the garden
[56:55] the reason I say that it's instructive
[56:58] to see how it's written
[57:00] they were running from the presence from
[57:02] the very presence because I remember I
[57:04] said in the presence is Clarity you
[57:06] don't have secrets it's very clear it's
[57:09] very bold it's plain this is where your
[57:11] faith could reach out and you can ask
[57:14] what you will in his presence
[57:16] and and be familiar with this one in
[57:19] Jonah's case
[57:21] Jonah is famous
[57:23] for running from the presence of God
[57:26] In Jonah chapter one you'd have to find
[57:28] it
[57:29] from verse one to four it says now the
[57:32] word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son
[57:34] of amitai
[57:36] saying arise
[57:38] that great City and cry against it for
[57:41] their wickedness has come up before me
[57:43] listen to verse 3. but Jonah rose up to
[57:48] flee on the tashish
[57:49] from the presence of the Lord
[57:53] and went down to Joppa and he found the
[57:56] ship going to chat to tashish so he paid
[57:59] the fair thereof and went down into it
[58:02] to go with them onto tashish
[58:05] from the presence of the Lord so he
[58:08] wasn't running from his country the
[58:10] state wasn't after him they didn't have
[58:12] a warrant of arrest they didn't have a
[58:14] summons to him but he was simply running
[58:16] from the presence of the Lord
[58:19] because the presence of the Lord there
[58:22] convicted him so much
[58:25] pressured him so much bothered him so
[58:28] much that he tried to run away
[58:30] that he tried to knock it
[58:32] and we know what happened in verse 4 but
[58:34] the Lord sent out a great wind into the
[58:36] sea and there was a mighty Tempest in
[58:38] the sea so that the ship was like to be
[58:41] broken and in verse 10 if I drop down
[58:44] there you got then with the men
[58:46] exceedingly afraid and said unto him why
[58:49] has thou done this
[58:51] for the men knew he fled from the
[58:55] presence of the Lord because he had told
[58:57] them so he didn't tell them listen I run
[59:00] in from Home Alone
[59:01] I run in from my parents house I run him
[59:03] from that wasn't his story you know
[59:05] he was very sincere at this point he
[59:07] said listen you see me
[59:09] this is me I am running from the
[59:12] presence of the Lord
[59:13] because I currently stand to be in our
[59:17] presence because what I'm being assigned
[59:19] to do what I'm being commissioned to do
[59:21] what I'm being appointed to to do I
[59:23] don't want to do right now so I run in
[59:26] from the presence of the Lord and we saw
[59:28] where where that led
[59:31] you know
[59:34] I want to shift gears a little bit and I
[59:36] want you to bear with me a little bit
[59:37] because
[59:39] I want to reiterate that getting in his
[59:43] presence
[59:45] will change you
[59:48] there's no question about it there's no
[59:51] doubt about it I'm not making a
[59:52] suggestion to you tonight and declaring
[59:55] a fact if you could only get in the
[59:57] presence of the Lord
[59:59] you will be completely changed
[1:00:02] and I have proof
[1:00:05] that this
[1:00:07] is a hundred percent truth
[1:00:09] no
[1:00:12] I'm just going to read a little bit when
[1:00:14] we come into His presence we'll change
[1:00:16] never to be the same look all down
[1:00:18] through the ages of every Walk of Life
[1:00:20] at man look at Abraham you say well the
[1:00:24] change life is just for ministers oh no
[1:00:26] the change life is for everybody see now
[1:00:30] Abraham was a farmer
[1:00:32] but when he heard God's voice speaking
[1:00:34] to him and saw that Vision he was a
[1:00:36] changed man from that time on he
[1:00:38] separated himself from his Kindred from
[1:00:41] his associates and worked as a pilgrim
[1:00:43] and a Stranger in a Strange Land the
[1:00:45] rest of his life dwelling in tents
[1:00:47] because he clearly confessed that he was
[1:00:49] seeking a city whose Builder and maker
[1:00:52] was God he knew there was a God and
[1:00:54] there was a city somewhere whose
[1:00:56] building maker was God that's what
[1:00:58] Hebrews 11 tells us and he was seeking a
[1:01:01] city right whose building maker was God
[1:01:03] he was a changed man yet he wasn't
[1:01:06] nothing more than a mere farmer
[1:01:08] amen but he saw a vision and came into
[1:01:12] the presence of God and this is where
[1:01:14] Everything Will Change
[1:01:15] and he was a changed man from then on
[1:01:18] Moses was a shepherd
[1:01:20] but he was a changed man when he came
[1:01:22] into the presence of God he was a coward
[1:01:25] he was running from Fear after killing
[1:01:26] one man
[1:01:27] with a whole Army behind him but with a
[1:01:30] stick in his hand he went back and took
[1:01:33] the whole nation see why he came into
[1:01:36] the presence of God he was a changed
[1:01:38] manner Shepherd now this one Peter a
[1:01:41] fisherman
[1:01:42] he didn't know anything about God he
[1:01:44] knew about fishing
[1:01:46] right
[1:01:47] he knew all he knew how to do was to
[1:01:50] catch fish
[1:01:51] but when he came in the presence of God
[1:01:53] and you see the great Creator who could
[1:01:55] create fish when he told him and we
[1:01:57] heard it on Sunday to let down your nets
[1:02:00] and he had just pulling nuts up and and
[1:02:02] in the scripture he was washing the Nets
[1:02:04] was washing it off when he did that to
[1:02:08] pack up shop and God said listen
[1:02:10] castianet on the other side
[1:02:13] do it again because
[1:02:14] we're here now I only reach now we know
[1:02:18] I wasn't around before you were doing it
[1:02:20] on your own your way but now I am
[1:02:23] instructing you and in this presence
[1:02:25] here when you put your net down we know
[1:02:27] the end of the story you need help and
[1:02:30] even the help need help because these
[1:02:32] boats go and start to sink because you
[1:02:33] will see exceedingly and abundantly
[1:02:36] above all you could ask or think
[1:02:40] he said at Thy word Lord I believe that
[1:02:44] you're the Son of God and if you left if
[1:02:46] you let down your net you told me do it
[1:02:48] at your word because you and your word
[1:02:50] are the same I let down the Nets and
[1:02:52] when he began to pull he said depart
[1:02:54] Lord I'm a sinful man see a fisherman
[1:02:57] after Peter met Christ he was never the
[1:02:59] same anymore
[1:03:00] he after Wards was so true to God he was
[1:03:03] given the keys to the kingdom we are
[1:03:05] still listen to Paul Paul a cell style
[1:03:08] Pharisee educated and trained in all the
[1:03:11] religion there was in the world
[1:03:14] come before the pillar of fire one day
[1:03:16] and God that he had persecuted
[1:03:19] ignorantly he was a Pharisee he didn't
[1:03:21] believe that God was a man he knowed God
[1:03:24] was a pillar of fire it led his people
[1:03:26] out of Egypt it had been with them all
[1:03:28] along and when he saw this Pillar of
[1:03:30] Fire he fell on his face and he heard a
[1:03:33] voice saying Saul why persecute us down
[1:03:36] me he said who are you Lord he said I am
[1:03:40] Jesus he was a man that said how have
[1:03:45] you been baptized he had been in the
[1:03:47] presence of God he was a changed man
[1:03:49] from then on he had been in the presence
[1:03:52] you see it changes a man this is proof
[1:03:55] that you can't enter his presence or
[1:03:58] encounter his presence and be the same
[1:04:00] that's from a message in his presence I
[1:04:03] want to go on a little more to present
[1:04:05] tense
[1:04:05] Charles Finney he was a lawyer
[1:04:09] a great Philadelphia lawyer but when he
[1:04:12] came into the presence of God he dropped
[1:04:14] his law study and became a mightiest
[1:04:16] preacher the nation had ever heard
[1:04:20] he was a preacher because one day he
[1:04:22] came in the presence of God he taught he
[1:04:25] studied a Ministry you know his book he
[1:04:28] got his autobiography he went out to
[1:04:31] pray and and in short
[1:04:34] he he really felt he had an interesting
[1:04:36] gift
[1:04:38] he thought he could just go and he had
[1:04:39] some sermons and he will preach
[1:04:41] and he would go and hide and pray in
[1:04:43] secret but there were some ladies at the
[1:04:46] church I said listen
[1:04:47] you need to be filled with the Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost you need to be filled you need to
[1:04:51] have an encounter with the presence of
[1:04:53] God and you know what he said he was a
[1:04:54] lawyer he said listen
[1:04:56] you can't tell me anything I'm an
[1:04:58] educated man I'm qualified I have my
[1:05:01] sermons here I know I'm called to preach
[1:05:04] you are a liberals you can't tell you
[1:05:06] praying for me well bless God for you
[1:05:08] but I don't need anything he will go and
[1:05:11] pray until one day
[1:05:14] he went to pray he went aside and his
[1:05:17] boss came
[1:05:18] when his boss came he was praying he
[1:05:21] kind of jumped up surprise
[1:05:23] and he realized what he actually was was
[1:05:26] ashamed of God he was ashamed to be
[1:05:30] caught praying right so when that
[1:05:33] happened he remembered what these ladies
[1:05:36] were saying about him being filled with
[1:05:37] the Holy Ghost and being in the presence
[1:05:40] of God and that caused such a depth of
[1:05:43] sincerity in his heart that when he came
[1:05:46] back he started to cry and I don't know
[1:05:48] if I'll get to it but
[1:05:51] let me see if I could touch it a little
[1:05:53] bit
[1:05:59] you know so these ladies said we're
[1:06:01] praying for you sweet little woman he
[1:06:03] went on
[1:06:04] so every day he'd go behind his office
[1:06:07] his boss and all them there that you
[1:06:09] worked he'd go out behind the law office
[1:06:11] and go out there and pray and one day he
[1:06:13] was out there praying and he heard a
[1:06:15] bush break
[1:06:17] coming up
[1:06:19] yeah
[1:06:21] hunting him he jumped up real quick he
[1:06:23] was saying Lord God I believe you but
[1:06:25] when he realized the boss was there he
[1:06:28] said raise up and said looks around he
[1:06:31] recognized it was he the bush that broke
[1:06:34] and he said he realized that bush had
[1:06:37] broke for a purpose he stood there tears
[1:06:40] running down his cheeks and he said
[1:06:41] maybe them woman's right
[1:06:44] I'm ashamed for somebody to see me
[1:06:46] talking to my God
[1:06:48] but I think it was an honor for somebody
[1:06:50] to see me talking to my boss
[1:06:53] how much greater is my Lord than my boss
[1:06:56] said Lord forgive me and fill me with
[1:06:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:00] started screaming and shouting he was in
[1:07:03] the presence of God he run downtown real
[1:07:06] quick to his office he got screaming so
[1:07:09] hard he had to go behind the door said
[1:07:11] Lord I'll bring this Grace upon you hide
[1:07:14] me back here till I get over the spell
[1:07:16] why he had come in the presence of God
[1:07:19] he was a changed man the sermons that he
[1:07:22] used to preach he preached them same
[1:07:24] sermons and souls came to the altar it
[1:07:27] was more meaningful at that time see he
[1:07:30] had been in the presence of God
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:41] I want to go on a little more
[1:07:43] Moody a little shoe cobbler
[1:07:46] hardly know what his ABC today we'll
[1:07:49] call him illiterate he hardly know this
[1:07:52] ABC that's right his grammar was poor
[1:07:54] somebody told him one day your grammar
[1:07:56] is awful poor Mr Moody he said but I'm
[1:07:58] winning Souls with it with my poor
[1:08:01] Grandma I'm winning Souls
[1:08:03] so don't worry about my grammar Our
[1:08:05] Winning Souls that's a man in the
[1:08:07] presence of God you'll see what I mean
[1:08:09] in a minute
[1:08:10] somebody told him one day a grandma's so
[1:08:12] poor you see a winning Souls wanted a
[1:08:15] newspaper editor went to write any
[1:08:17] newspaper he went over to see how could
[1:08:20] this man hold crowds of people under any
[1:08:22] conditions little old guy this is his
[1:08:25] description little old guy ball head
[1:08:29] and everything Whiskers hanging down
[1:08:32] kind of pot-bellied and he was a
[1:08:34] horrible looking man to look at
[1:08:36] so this newspaper really gave him a
[1:08:39] write-up they didn't see what in the
[1:08:42] world would anyone see in Dwight Moody
[1:08:46] he had all the characteristics of a
[1:08:48] failure yet he was pulling a crowd and
[1:08:51] holding a crowd and using bad grammar
[1:08:54] and still winning Souls
[1:08:56] they said he's ugly his voice is squeaky
[1:09:00] he's got whiskers plumbed down to his
[1:09:02] waistline he's a ball-headed as a
[1:09:04] pumpkin they said how in the world would
[1:09:06] anybody ever go to see anything in Moody
[1:09:10] so Moody's manager happens to see the
[1:09:13] newspaper and this is where he becomes
[1:09:15] interesting because this is when you
[1:09:17] understand where you are within the
[1:09:19] context of the presence of God when his
[1:09:21] manager saw it he said look Mr Moody
[1:09:23] I'll read this to you because Mr Moody
[1:09:26] couldn't read for himself
[1:09:28] Mr Murray couldn't read so he said I'll
[1:09:30] read you the editorial
[1:09:32] and he you know he read it for him
[1:09:35] and Mr Moody as I could only imagine
[1:09:37] right now
[1:09:38] shrug her shoulders and said in essence
[1:09:41] as we will say now
[1:09:43] I don't care what they say the people
[1:09:45] not coming to see me they come to see
[1:09:47] Christ and attacks and the story this is
[1:09:49] a man who understands his role position
[1:09:52] and who he is
[1:09:54] you know so he moved from a couple of
[1:09:56] making shoes for people to wear to to
[1:09:58] shorten Gospel of preparation why he was
[1:10:02] in the presence of God
[1:10:06] you know a little woman came one time
[1:10:09] come in the presence of God as guilty as
[1:10:11] she could be in a moment when she
[1:10:13] realized she was in the presence of God
[1:10:15] every sin was forgiven she was as pure
[1:10:18] as and white as a lily oh my how many
[1:10:22] more I could call off here of people
[1:10:24] time wouldn't permit but
[1:10:27] brother Brandon say I want to talk about
[1:10:28] myself I don't know who this is for
[1:10:31] tonight but I think this is such a
[1:10:32] blessing and was such a blessing to me I
[1:10:35] want to read it you say I want to talk
[1:10:37] about myself a little bit
[1:10:39] he said what could be any lower than me
[1:10:42] where was I come out of a family of
[1:10:44] drunkards come out of a family of
[1:10:47] murderers come out of a family of
[1:10:49] bootleggers and you know that every one
[1:10:53] of you know it know what kind of name we
[1:10:56] had here people didn't speak to us on
[1:10:58] the street I go downtown start to talk
[1:11:01] to somebody nobody would want to talk to
[1:11:03] me unless somebody wasn't around they
[1:11:06] were all embarrassed to talk to him they
[1:11:09] talked to me if somebody else comes up
[1:11:12] they would leave
[1:11:13] this is the prophet speaking now and I'd
[1:11:15] stand there and cry no they're saying so
[1:11:17] it can be this is so wrong but one day I
[1:11:20] come into the presence of God he changed
[1:11:23] me and made me another kind of son his
[1:11:26] grace brought me into his presence I've
[1:11:28] never wanted to leave it I'm now here 30
[1:11:31] something odd years I don't want to
[1:11:33] leave it I've got the assurance that
[1:11:35] I'll always be there even death itself
[1:11:38] will never separate me from his presence
[1:11:40] no I'll be with him forever when I seen
[1:11:43] his presence the first time I cried like
[1:11:45] Isaiah what is me then he touched me
[1:11:48] with his grace I was a changed person
[1:11:51] consistent theme there is no way you
[1:11:53] could enter the presence of God and be
[1:11:56] the same and remain the same something
[1:11:59] has to change something has to break
[1:12:01] something has to happen
[1:12:05] said a little Renegade that used to get
[1:12:07] out here and carry on and everything
[1:12:08] must change and since then I have been
[1:12:11] his child since then I've desired to
[1:12:13] give my whole life first service only
[1:12:15] wish I had ten thousand more lives to
[1:12:18] give for him this one's getting pretty
[1:12:20] well wore out 53 years have passed about
[1:12:23] 33 of those and I just scroll up
[1:12:27] a little bit you know he said I never
[1:12:29] desire to leave this heavenly Place do
[1:12:32] they tempt her to persuade me after I've
[1:12:34] tried but I'm safe in God's Pavilion and
[1:12:37] happy in his love and grace I'm living
[1:12:39] on the Hallelujah side my it makes my
[1:12:42] heart Rejoice I'm recommending him to
[1:12:45] every weary person I'm recommending him
[1:12:48] to you that have no hope you that's
[1:12:50] never been in his presence the only
[1:12:52] thing you have to do is confess your
[1:12:54] sins and realize that you're wrong and
[1:12:57] God has that angel ordained tonight
[1:12:59] called the Holy Ghost that'll take all
[1:13:03] your sins away then you'll cry Lord here
[1:13:06] I am
[1:13:07] am I send me then you'll raise your
[1:13:10] hands and sing I will praise him I will
[1:13:13] praise him praise the Lamb for Sinners
[1:13:16] slain give him glory only people for his
[1:13:19] blood has washed away each thing I love
[1:13:22] him don't you living in the presence
[1:13:26] of God Amen that's from the same message
[1:13:29] in his presence
[1:13:32] I mean it just goes to show if we could
[1:13:35] only understand his presence if we could
[1:13:37] recognize this presence if we could
[1:13:40] acknowledge the power and purpose of his
[1:13:43] presence then no one will be the same
[1:13:46] way they came no one will be able to
[1:13:48] operate at the same level they operate
[1:13:50] now your your attitude your perspective
[1:13:53] your system your sight the way you see
[1:13:55] things will change if you could only
[1:13:58] listen to that still Small Voice let go
