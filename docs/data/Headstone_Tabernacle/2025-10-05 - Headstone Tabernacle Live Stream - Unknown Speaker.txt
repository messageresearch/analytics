Psalms chapter 126 says, "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream." Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing. They said, "Then they said, uh, then then said they, sorry, among the heathen, the Lord had done great things for them. The Lord had done great things for us, whereof we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams of the south. For they that sew in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again rejoicing, bringing his sheav with him. May God add blessing to the reading of his word.

Waste of time. There's no revelation. There's no uncction. There's no inspiration. He said that is what the Holy Ghost is given for. &gt;&gt; It's to give uncction to the preacher. &gt;&gt; It's to bring holiness to the group. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is to set the church in order. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for. Not just yapping, yapping, yapping, talking, talking, talking. No, but to get something moving &gt;&gt; because he promised to come among us. &gt;&gt; I am not him. He promised to come among us. &gt;&gt; And he said, and then you are worshiping the living Christ. &gt;&gt; Him moving in and out. That mean he could move in this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you move in this morning, your worship shows whether you have revelation or not. Your worship shows whether you see your name on the book or not. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Just a message believer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you see your name, something happens.

We We seeking a city whose maker and builder is God. &gt;&gt; We on our way to get out of here. I am journeying. I pick up a wife. I was journeying. Pick up children that was journeying. Grandchildren journeying. But we getting out of here. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read the scripture before we get in some of this. But let's stand. You want to read Joel chapter 1 1-4. Joel chapter 22 23-29. This anointing inside of here. I believe that God going to break forth &gt;&gt; something of his presence and his power and supernatural. Joel 1, the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Petuel. Here they see old men and give he all the inhabitants of the land. Had this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers, tell your children of it. Let your children tell their children and their children another generation. That which the paloon had left had the locust eaten. That which the locust had left had the kang eaten. That which the kang left had a had the caterpillar eaten. God said tell it to your children. Let them tell. Some don't overflow. overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the glucas had eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm my great army which I sent among you and he shall be eat and in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God and that that that dealt wondously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmmaids. In those days will I pour my spirit. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word interpreted our hearts today and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. I ask in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will be seated and give God some praises &gt;&gt; as you sit down. Praise God. There's a reason why we talk so much about praising God and give the Lord a shout and glory to God because the message about the dead &gt;&gt; and we fighting against that dead spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you don't if if you don't open your mouth and praise God, you will just stay cold and dormant &gt;&gt; and the devil will put an air condition right by your ears and soo your way and out your light and make you sleep &gt;&gt; in the arms of morphas. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. to fight sleepy spirit, fight dead spirit, fight former spirit, fight Catholic spirit, fight the spirit of Luther and Wesley, them man spirit that come across into the message to fight all of that. Fight the message spirit too. Praise God. Hallelujah. Sit down and do sit down and don't forget that. Praise God. I forbe say amen. 24 elders cast on their crown and worthy is the lamb to receive honor and blessing and dominion. And people talking about they see the name on the book. They see the name not even the Catholic book. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. But the lamb's book of life, God's privilege. You are one in a million. And God open up this word to you. Put your name in the lamb book of life. I don't get you're sick in your foot. You're sick in your hand. You're sick in your head or you're sick in your mind. The fact that God put your name, Jesus told them, don't rejoice because the devil is subject unto you. Rejoice because your name is in heaven. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a title this morning, I will restore &gt;&gt; and I'm an inspiration, the restoration of all things. &gt;&gt; Now we preach Wednesday night was a real battle with a tech and something like that. But I want to bring back that from Wednesday night and then I'll come after it and share some things with you. I have some things I would like to share. But this is the scripture here uh Acts 3:19:21. And he said, "Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you." Here we go. whom the heaven must receive &gt;&gt; until the times of the restitution of all things which God had spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began. &gt;&gt; So it's a prophecy &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a restitution or a restoration of all things. Now in Matthew 17 10-12 and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribe &gt;&gt; that the liars must first come &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto them Elias prophecy &gt;&gt; truly &gt;&gt; shall first come. &gt;&gt; He's talking about William Brham &gt;&gt; Elias truly shall first come and restore all things. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. So brother Brandham anointing was a restoration anointing. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. That's why he came to restore our hearts. back to the faith of the fathers wasn't just to add another church or to announce another church. It was to restore the church back to the original back to the faith that the father has had. We give the Lord some praises. So right now this morning, you are under a restoration anointing or anointing of reconciliation. That mean God going to bring you back. That is why under the spirit and the bride. Revelation 22:17, the voice say come. Whosoever will come. Oh, glory to God. Whatever condition they're in, come. Oh, glory to God. The spirit of the bride will say come. Not go come. Oh the Lord, I shall come and delivered. Come and be healed. Come be set free. Come. Let God break the band of wickedness over your life. Oh the Lord, I shout in the house. Amen. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to go straight to that table of Shane want to get into this morning. Just just soak it in. If you was here Wednesday night, listen to it again. There a lot of stuff inside of there. You can't afford to miss. So, let's go straight into that
