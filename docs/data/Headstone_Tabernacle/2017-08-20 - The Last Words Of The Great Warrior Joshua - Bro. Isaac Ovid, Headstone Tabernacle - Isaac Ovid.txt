a great time in the Lord so we want to read from first Thessalonians chapter 5 but of the times another seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh like a thief in the night so when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction shall come upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not escape but he brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness oh praise be to Jesus raise let's continue here for here we go let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for did I three sleep in the night and they that be drunken drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed you to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we would live together with him wherefore comfort one another together and edify one another even as also you do and we beseech you brethren to know them which lever among you and over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work seek and be at peace among yourselves and our last croissants first Peter chapter 1 with 13

God amen well the team of the meetings in Nigeria was the hour of God deliverance and what a tremendous time that we had for me it was a defining meeting and it all come together it was every single service was so anointed in other supernatural level from the very start of the very food service and it's impressive to see the sacrifices some of these believers make to come to meetings you know and I quickly put because I mean but their group just had two meals and but but that's what they could do one song like that and and the believers dear and to see Power Plus before service they'll be singing waiting for the doors to be open and I don't know who this hold it in front day but a half I put a clip of my Facebook page and another sample of it but I was something else to be hearing the moving and the singing and the just waitin for the doors to be open and the atmosphere was just Rocking praise God so each minister delivered to the people the wood and seasoned food for the Soul strength for the journey and moisten and power that was throughout their meetings the believers would line up up before all those Auckland singing wait and what atmosphere it was an experience to be there and the host pastor but our culture we did a tremendous job because what Shri services the D I wonder how that could be accomplished but my goodness when Gordon Han is something it's done perfectly I couldn't believe it could have been executed in Africa with such efficiency and and whatever but they got really really bless it but a key but a channeler myself but a Jessie Robledo but a daily but I Isaac but every month Thompson butter Olu and brother this morning before what I succumb and speak I want you to understand the Bible speaks about being Suba tomorrow supposed to have a solar eclipse amazing solar eclipse that people talking about a lot because they know we'll have big significance that God said before he does anything on earth you're going to give a signal of it in heaven and I believe America is already judged already judged they are just waited for sentences then you know how they operate in the court the judge you and this is sentences next six months or next year or next two months you have to come back for these sentences after the penalty that goes without judgment neither vivo America is already judge just waitin for the sentences so we ought not to be unaware or taking on our ways or be surprised of what is yet to come because it's coming whether you're ready or not is - coming it doesn't matter where you think or what you feel or what you have it ready or not it's so common are you with me so therefore this is a major one for last last one was about 58 years ago so we know that will bring its own drama with people or the doomsday is coming out everybody come another state would they waive any she is watch this this is a moon get that out amen and the Isaiah prophesy groans doctors covered is it rock doesn't suffer the people but God went to sunlight upon his pride upon his people but this would be sober it means be serious be thoughtful be steady be level-headed the businesslike be strained don't act like a junkman those that drunk this junk in the night be sober because of what is coming up on the face of the earth remember in the day of Sodom and so on when the power the waterfall they were going to work normal he was going to withdraw their monthly pee normal there's going to the groceries I pick up some butter and some sugar or whatever normal but far on the waterfall but but besides those people were not aware there was a elected Bunch that was called out that bunch was represented by the man called Abraham when God was speaking he said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do something was about to happen so God had to make sure he got a word to his people before it happened and once something went to take place God must get a word to his people and I believe they're gonna get a word from the Lord this morning praise be to Jesus that one was done along with you but brother Brandon said this on what is the Holy Ghost he said no it's grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are filled until you dare Redemption that's a new word you must be sealed so if not there's no word for you to come and join just joint church and shake somebody hands you come to be sealed sealed with God or get his Mack because in the last days there be two marks not 10 not 15 or 27 it's just two marks the Mac of God and the Mac of the beasts all those who don't get the Mac of God will take the mark of the beast so what you want is the mask of God what you come for is to be marked by God and the mark of God upon your life means devil you could watch but you can't touch that is what the mark of God means that mark is the same as the blood over the doorpost when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you that is what that map represents you income it to fool around you're committed in Mack yeah kanessa take selfies or big pictures of your clothes and you can get to be mocked you commit to be hungry and Tilson Arthur right she doesn't bless it I did a hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be fill or give the Lord a praise offer or hallelujah praise God so you come here this morning not to get back with the pasta but to be filled with the Holy Ghost you don't even a pain to get back pain for that run out they don't get time to get angry tensed up run out there are painful jealousy time for that run out you are trying to be that paper that run out your tend to be sober because the day of the Lord is at hand is how come suddenly like a woman in travail this shall not escape or give the Lord a shout in the house or glory to God so when you are sealed your futility no pastor no bishop report could take back zero for you no LM not digging to pick what seals from offer you when God put this Mac it is God not the pastor not the preacher it is part o dog give a lot of shout in the house you are filled until the day of your redemption and I see represent a finished work it means your phone grease in his sight and he loves you and he believes you let me put a seal upon you what is the seal of see you designate a finished work when the work is done you seal it hallelujah praise God when you have a sweet ring or sauce or pink or whatever it is you have to crack it because it's healed that's a brigadier snap it's sealed that's what we're talking about when God finished with you seal it is seal never get that seal but the seal under your theory cancel well or your seal is complete the except to somewhere let you hear that Deb is this yes a to somebody like hope or you are a business I thought you are that the deficit he except to heal you doesn't matter what your husband think doesn't matter what your wife think doesn't matter what the children think it doesn't matter what the never pink he seal you holy the Holy Ghost is the same the Holy Ghost is a seal a saying that God did this chosen children not to reject it is to be cut off on the people to receive it is to be finished with the world so you have a choice the will hang on are wrong you have to

condition that a Mary didn't know where DNA or chlorine I've gotta find out what God had for you what you must take what you must possess or glory to God let's continue no one is a finished work the

of the flood or the god of the amorite and whose landed well but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so I greet you this morning in the precious and wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ is certainly good to be home and to be in a presence of the Lord on Sunday morning there are so many people don't have this privilege and it will be a privilege we will not have always there will come a time and we will not be able to meet like this and the comforts of church will no longer exist and there will be no more opportunity to pretend and to play Church it will either be that you are real or you are not real so we are looking forward for a day that's coming like no other day a time is coming like no other time because this is not our home we are just passing through and every day we come closer to transitioning from time into eternity and we long for the day when we will see David and see Abraham and see no one and see the Prophet and because we are not creatures of time we are creatures of eternity and but overed you were speaking about the great convention that we had in Enugu Nigeria was really a tremendous meeting and the inspiration and he said was the arrow of God's deliverance and I just want to touch that just briefly before I get to my text this morning because it provided for me the foundation for how I even got this message this morning now you could look through your Bibles you can have a little Sunday School this morning second Kings 13 and reading verse 14 second Kings 13 and reading verse 14 and the Bible says now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died so it was not it was not like a common call it was a sickness for which they knew he was about to go and joash the king of Israel came down unto Him and wept over his feet and that all my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof so josh is actually saying what Elijah would have said when Elijah was leaving when the mantle was passed on Elijah this was the word that Elijah would have said and here it is Elijah now is on his deathbed as it were and joash is coming to him with the same declaration my father my father the chariot Israel and the horseman thereof and at this time the children of Israel were under oppression from the Syrians so Elijah in verse 15 said unto Him take bow and arrows and he took unto Him bow and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put down hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and he lies so put his hands upon the Kings hand and he that opened a window east when he opened it and Elijah said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the laws deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for those out smite the Syrians and affect till thou have consumed them but it didn't end there he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of Israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice three times and Steve he stopped and the man of God was rock with him angry and said thou sort of spittin five or six times then had his doubts mitten cereal till thou has consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice and Elijah died and they buried him and I'll pause there for a minute so for the entire convention the ministers were speaking around the hour of God's deliverance and the Prophet said the hour of God's deliverance is the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Spirit and in the Memphis the error of God's deliverance shot from a boat but the random said God shut that arrow into the early church on the day of Pentecost and in every age in every time when they needed deliverance God would send the arrow of deliverance into the situation as a sign that the power of God was there but when we read the situation with Elijah Elijah told him to shoot pick up the air Owen and strike the ground he didn't tell the King how much time to strike and by the venom said that joão's was back slidden of the king he was back slidden as a leader that's why you only struck three times and the prophet of God did if you are struck five or six you would have completely finished the enemy but because you only struck three times you will only have three victories so the scripture was bringing a connection between activity and results the more you do the more you get out of it if you strike once you have one victory you have strike two you get two victories you psyche three you get three victories but if you go beyond your limitations go beyond your ideas so aim to us and pushed and hit four times and hit and the Prophet said five or six and I said to them in enugu the Prophet didn't tell him exactly how much was necessary so if he says five or six five I believe would have been enough six would have been extra he was telling to us if you are done extra you would have made sure and wiped the enemy out and that's what we have come to do this morning some extra three times is not enough Jeff lifting your hands is not enough praying once in the morning is not enough have you prayed three times four times five times up he would have a different result because the arrow of God's deliverance has already been shot can the church team and everybody with me this morning so as I was meditating on this Scripture and this inspiration was so powerful and we'll get to more of that I started to wonder here was Elijah leaving and his last words the last word that Elijah would speak was words of anger because after that verse the Bible says the next verse and Elijah died Elijah died with the words just before him saying those should have done more the last word Eliezer spoke was you did not do enough I told you to do something but instead of going all the way you struck three times when if you were done more you would have totally wiped out the enemy and the Bible says Elijah died and I started away who is you know that stuff that you would see in different situation there are times you're having fun and you will see whatever come to your Mountain you comment on politics you comment on the news you comment on where you went to school and maybe you tell your friends what trouble you're having at home and maybe you share this with this one and but there's something else when you are at the end of your road you see when someone is lying on deathbed words take on a different meaning because when you are the end of the world the end of the world or the end of your life all of a sudden the joke store any matter too much and your words have a whole different width and I have a question this morning if you knew that you would be speaking to someone for the very last time you would never see them again there'd be nothing more you could ever tell him again what would would you see if it was the last time that he would speak to some money what would your last words be and I go back to the thief on the cross he got anything he could have said but his last words were remember me and jesus said to him today you will be with me in paradise even Jesus had a choice of what his last words would be I'm in the last moment the last chapter of his life he said Father forgive them for they know not what they're doing and he ended it just earthly life with it is finished Joseph in his closing remarks said whatever you do take my bones with you because resurrection is coming don't leave me here in Egypt [Applause] Samson last words let me die with the Philistines last words that's what I want to speak about this morning so for a few minutes of this Bible study I have a tighter the last words of the great warrior Joshua the last words of the great warrior Joshua now Joshua was not a preacher the Branum said in the message great warrior Joshua he said that there was never a military leader in the past future present at any time like Joshua just so was a man in a class a category all by himself he was a warrior of warrior he was a soldier but to the end of just was ministry his ministry changed another fighting anymore but for some reasons us were found himself speaking a lot Joshua has 24 chapters the book of Joshua and just what 22 Joshua 23 and just what 24 is all about Josh was speaking in just what 22 he is speaking to the two-and-a-half tribes who were given their portion on the other side of Jordan in just what parent III is because of the leaders of Israel and he's reminding them to stay with the Covenant to stay with the word to pay with the promise here is a mammoth of fighter but he is turning to an orator he's turned into a speaker I mean just what 24 the scripture that we read just will find themselves speaking to everybody he summoned the whole of Israel can the church see me Joshua is at the end of his Road he knows is over since just were 13 the Bible says and Justin was all and stricken in age and the Lord said you are all in chicadini dozen 15 reign chapter 24 and the Bible says and just were gathered all the tribes of Israel the second and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God just was ministry is over he has come to the end of his Road he has done the job that God had called him to do he has been faithful he has took the test of time but there's something going on that causes Joshua to stop and call an assembly you don't want to meet them because you want to call a meeting we are here in charge because we we steal in to have Church this is an assembly has been called by God because there's a word that the Lord has for his people [Applause] the book of Joshua is a book of a soldier coming into being here with this many things have seen Moses in action and when Moses died here it was God's focus of the Joshua get up Moses my servant is dead he gives people over meditate on the word their night every place you put your foot is yours you do nothing you get nothing you step you get something what Prince means possession and just was stepped up to the plate he had no example before him he was the first of his kind there was no before him like he wants there will be none after him that he was the random teaches us Joshua parallels Ephesians the other that just with a type of Christ also did that just was a type of the Holy Ghost so then starts for that we are speaking about is a powerful text that we are in this morning Joshua has seen a lot and I can imagine when you know you are coming to the end of your road because just ways at the end of his journey where the Clarence I'm not doubt he's anointed he's inspired to bring the people together to share with them something profound just we're supposed to give the last words the last words of the great prophet great warrior Joshua if you know where the last time you will ever speak to a crowd of people what would it be it was the last service you will ever preach what pets would you take what scripture would you read what title would you use and this was the dilemma that just were found himself in and he stood before the entire host of Israel he had finished dealing with it two and a half tribe yet finished speaking to the leaders of Israel but now he stood before all the tribes of Israel and he had to say something to them I can imagine any for us tonight Joe I preached about Jericho the victory that I had when I was there all alone preparing for that clean selling I was there meditating sharpening my sword and oh I could imagine as as US was too dear all these memories are coming back to him to share with the peoples and chorus of people because he was about to leave them I can imagine Joshua remember the battle that he fought when he had held Moses hands up because the Lord pet was Moses hands was up he would win the battle and Joshua was Moses Minister he was there with Aaron given Moses support he have seen a lot but what would he share for the people at the last words of the great warrior Joshua would also remind them of when they took out haricots and he told them let us leave and don't touch anything in Jericho because everything in Jericho is cursed and when we walked out at Jericho just what didn't know that there was one man in the camp who had taken gold and taken stuff from Jericho and hid it among his things when they went to the Battle of Eid lost men it still pains us what does that be the fact that they lost men because the men who died it was not their fault it was Ekans force because Joseph was very clear do not touch the unclean thing so just well had a decision to make when he comes before the whole horse of Israel what what his last words be anybody with me this morning so let's read a scripture a little bit and just what said unto all the people don't say it the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in all time even Tara the father of Abraham and a part of Nicole and deceived other gods but just one now in species on a preacher but he goes back to the beginning and he begins to encourage the people and remind them of where they came from remind them of what they went through remind them of how they were found in sin and God took them out of sin remind them that they were born left up to begin with but if it wasn't with the grace of God they wouldn't be standing in front of him he reminded them of the history verse 3 and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood and let him throw all the land of Canaan and multiply his seed and give him Isaac in other words Abraham didn't do it on his own it was I who gave him Isaac Joshua is speaking and he's speaking on behalf of his father he said an eye gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Esau mounts here to possess it but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt I send Moses also an errand and I take Egypt this is Gore taking credit for what he did according but that which I did among them and after what I brought you out did he bring you out did he pick your turtle marry clay did he take you out of the world did he take you out of sin did he find you where you are hiding on the other side of the flood because you know anything about him he is a fine young he called you he predestinated you you may be seated listen God is not now saving he's not now delivering what God is it's already done he has already done it you don't get what I'm saying right now but the Bible says who he foreknew he calls it that call is past tense he is not calling who he foreknew he calls who we call he hath already justified [Applause] who is certifying yet already glorified that's already passed and that's not to come in the back of God's mind he sees you on fire in the back of God my knee he's you deliver in the back part of God mighty sees you full of the Holy Ghost in the back path of God money sees you perfect in the back path of God mighty sees you in power and it's not your strength it is not by might nor by power but is that I have done it I took you out of Egypt I delivered you i preserved you I woke you up this morning I put food on your table it's not your job that put food on your table I put food on your table your whole company exists because I put it there to make sure there's food on your table Oh are there any questions in the house this morning [Applause] you may be seated so trust saw the green warrior he is speaking and he is preaching his greatness message because it's the last words of the great warrior Joshua and he said I sent Moses also and Aaron and I predict Egypt according to that which I did among them and after what I brought you out it didn't stop there and I brought your father's out of Egypt and he came unto the sea so just was going through their whole history and the Egyptians pursued after your father's with chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea and when they cried unto the Lord he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt anybody with me this morning and you dwelt in the wilderness a long season but I'm not done yet say I brought you into the land of the AMA writes which dwelt on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that you might possess their land and I destroyed them from before you so when you walk you're doing the fighting just to remind you just to bring back to your memory I was the one who destroyed them from before you when you drew your sword I was the one holding is that when you raise your shield I was the one behind you [Applause] what a message just was Priscilla just was going in anything and then after that then balak the son of zippor king of moab rules and war against israel and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to kiss you but I was not hearken unto balaam Oh therefore he blessed you still so when he was trying to curse you the curse became a blessing so I delivered you out of his hand and just was that done it and he said and he went over Jordan and came out at Eriko and the men of Jericho fought against you the amorite and the parasites and the Canaanite and the headlights and the girgashites the hivite and the jebusite and I deliver them into your hand and I send the Hornet before you let's drag them out from before you even the two kings of the amorite but not with dice order nor with typos and I given you a land for which he did not labor and cities which he built not and he'd welland them out of vineyards and olive ia's which he planted not do you eat [Music] can we get a lot of salt it's not your effort it's not what you're doing but the pranam City of God is the summary of Iowa it wouldn't even be your prayer but it'll be the grace of Almighty God he has gone all by himself he is the way makeup he is the restorer he is the deliverer he is the one who raises Kings up and breaking them down he has caught all by himself he is el-shaddai he is your Hobart IRA he is a home asuma he is a Holman listen he is the Sirius of bakla he is the shewbread he is the morning stop he is the Alpha he is the Omega he is the beginning he is the door he is the way he is the truth he is the life he is the method he is the messenger he is Jesus Christ today me yesterday he is the world he is there he is mechanic he is dynamic and it has been him all along leading us you could not be here this morning unless he called you unless he picked you unless he chose you that's only review kapinas house this morning you could not save yourself you couldn't wake up yourself you can heal yourself [Applause] you may be seated now this is where Joshua gets down to the main part of his message everything he said thus far was laying a foundation it spoke of where they had come from it spoke of God taking him out God fighting for them what court had done for them but no he's a boat to deliver the most important part of his message he was bringing it personal to the individual now and he was now switching from what God has done what God is doing to the individual listen carefully now therefore and this is a ship that I read fear the Lord and the Bible tells us that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom it's a scary thing when people don't fear the Lord people walk into the church anyway they want to walk through life any way they want to without even an acknowledgment of God far less for a fear of God so just was now delivering the most important part of his message and I want everybody to get this now now therefore fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods now the fact that Joshua has to be saying this meant there was an issue in the campus that he was trying to address put away the gods with your father spilled on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and Sylvie the Lord now verse 15 a lot of people read the scripture incorrectly listen carefully to what justice is and if it seems evil to you young people mother father message believer if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord if you have a problem to serve the Lord if you take offense when we tell you to serve the Lord he gives them a choice and the choice contrary to popular belief in this verse is not a choice between God and the devil listen to the choice that gives and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose ye this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father's served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorite in whose land eat well and then Joshua put his testimony on this but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I want you to listen carefully Church because this is where many of us mr. mark just why synonym if you have a problem with serving God these are your two choices either you serve the God of your past or you serve the God of the present so Joshua was drilling down into what I call the real issue because if you say you don't serve the gods of your past but you don't want to serve the god the king of kings and Lord of lords then there's another option there's another God to serve the god of the land in which you live you left Egypt but you in the land of the amorite it's a battleground it's a fight and there people who say when I left the world I don't smoke I don't drink I don't go to parties but they have new gods the god of the amorite the god of the land in which they live now so they feel comfortable seeing I'm in the tribe of Israel I'm not in Egypt we cross Jordan we cross we came over the Red Sea we're in the land but they have not served the true God so just what in his last words were saying friends make up your mind because the devil has traps and lead for you and many of you are falling into the traps that's why we're having this service that's why we have in this message this morning because I don't want you feel like you're right because you're not in Egypt when there are new gods that you are but the Brennan 20 to make anything of God and the true an appeaser will not in Egypt but they have found new gods in the land of the amorite what God are you worshiping but the Branham speaks of a man was beating up preachers I'll give you an example and everywhere he went he was beating up peaches and when they found themselves in the place where the Prophet wizard was and the Prophet was on the platform as it were and when they saw the man coming all the ministers left and left the puppet standing by himself and as that man was coming saying whatever you were saying coming to the Prophet the Prophet said you will fall out over my feet you remember then I went a man fell over the prophets feet the police came and they asked the Prophet will this man be all right but the madam said no he will not why because he worships the spirit that is upon him and there are many people who have left the visible Egypt as it were but in sip in church and they worship the God of the ammonites the spirits they worshipped social media because whatever you spend your time is is what your God is sort of the choose you this day whom you will serve who you will serve who you will spend time worshiping what you will spend time doing choose you this day the God that you will worship because two three hours or four hours and a Sunday is a small fraction of your time you claim to be out of Egypt what are you doing on a Monday you claim to be out of Egypt but what are you doing on a Tuesday you told me you loved Egypt but what are you doing on a Wednesday choose you this day whom you will serve do you want to go back to the gods of Egypt do you want to serve these clothes of the other eyes but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I want to go on in the scripture because Russia was probing at the people so the 16th said and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the law to serve other gods so I'm just like what is one of the most God forbid we will not do that and then give the reason why in verse 17 for the Lord our good he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and with did these great signs and our sight and preserved us in all the way when we went and among all the people through whom we have passed and the Lord's reward from before all the people this is the people talking now from even the amorite which dwell in the land therefore will we also serve the Lord for he is our God listen the trust was response and just was said unto the people he cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he's a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if he for seek the Lord and serve strange Goods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he had done you good and the people senator doesn't name but we will serve the Lord in other words Joshua wanted to make sure that the people really was serious about this thing and he said God is a jealous good he's a holy God he doesn't want to be shared with anybody else he is supposed to be number one at all times he doesn't want to be a part time got to you he wants to be God all the time somebody shame [Applause] and just what some of the people here witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to suited and they said we are witnesses now therefore put away instead heat estranged goods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said of the judge with a Lord our God will receive and his voice will we o be so it sorts for made a covenant with the peoples that be and said them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem and just we'll wrote these words in the book of the law and God took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and just what said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us it shall be there for a witness unto you lest he deny your God so just well let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and they came to pass after these things that just were the son of nun the cylinder the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old the last words of the great warrior Joshua friends many of us we make excuses we make excuses for why we act the way we act we make excuses for why we can live up to certain expectations we make excuses for why we don't have time to pray why we didn't come to service why we spoke that way to somebody else you make excuses all of these things and many times we speak and the brother branham's talk about what the Holy Ghost is given for how it comes to change your speech and change your walk and change your talk and change your behavior and that is true no question about it but for many of the things that we go through it comes down to making a decision in other words with all the only goals there's some decisions that you have the power to make you don't need to have the Holy Ghost to tell the devil no you don't want to smoke the only ghost gives you power but you have the ability to choose because every day we make decisions and our life is the total of the decision that we make so Joshua standing in front of the people on scene today choose who you will serve make a choice do you really want to be a Christian do you really want to serve God do you really want to have a testimony or do you want to go to the world don't win tomorrow today choose the day whom you will serve the problem is many of us we have not made a firm decision knowing something is right it's not a decision to do what is right there are many people with high blood pressure who know they're not supposed to eat salt in or not was it salt but I'll tell you this you mean to tell me you need to get some anointing to not eat sauce so I'm going to pray for you to tell you what is a soul spirit it's down to decisions and that's really what this message is about this morning being in the valley of decision all about this morning we are at a crossroads just what had brought the true level to a crossroads in the ending of his ministry you have to make a choice and it has to be your choice to be a Christian and to serve God God is not deciding for you he's not choosing for you you have to make a choice a choice to stand a choice to pray a trying to forgive a trifle of a choice to worship a choice a choice to listen to only music but it through and out of your music collection a choice to read the Bible or to read books that will take you away from God friends there are only two influences and the eject that influences you have a choice with which influence you will listen to somebody helped me this morning choose you this day whom you will serve there are people sitting in the message that have not made a choice to serve the Lord the novices right and notice is the truth but what is it choice that you have it because go to all the profit because thou has chosen it's the hard way it's a tough away a huge portion of heaven who waits you young people you have to make the choice your father cannot make the choice the path that can make you even Jesus how to labor and get some money and he had a choice to make and he was praying he was in agony is their father if it is possible let this cup pass he had a choice you had a choice this morning whether you will come to church or stay home you have a choice tomorrow whether you're about to work or not you have a choice if you will pray before you go to work you are a choice if you will read the Bible if before you go to work that's your choice if it is important to you you will make the correct choice but how important is this kingdom of God to you you have to choose today not tomorrow tomorrow will be too late choose the day whom you will serve you have to choose to clean your life out absolutely and turn those Falls goes out throw them out of your house turn them out of your life that's the choice you have to make it just reminded them of what God had done but they still had to make the choice why are you until it's on you heavy can't worship no joy you know why you made choices that attacked your joy you made choices that attacked your victory when if you make the correct choices the devil could have no grip on you has no power over you have no hole on you because it devil could never reach you once you are under the blood once you repent on you under the blood the devil cannot get through the blood but the brand impressed for him to get under the blood is the confessed he needs to be like you and get anger he can do it so what devil you talking about we need to accept responsibility for our choices the devil cannot break down your door even he said behold I am in a door knock you have a choice to open the door [Applause] behold I stand at the door I'm not going if any man here nope now come in and sup with him Jesus not breaking down the door of your heart breaking down the door of your life I'm gonna force you to do anything you have to choose because one day the Bible said he who is filthy be filthy still he was righteous righteous still that righteousness of filthiness is not God senioritis your filthy that's decisions that decisions so this service is not about your children then about your wife your husband not about your boss or your neighbor is that what you choose them to be a Christian Susan to dress like a Christian choose it to speak like a Christian choosing have a testimony like a Christian choose you this day whom you will serve do you want to go back into the past or you want to just dwell where you at now in the land of the MRIs or do you want to serve the one and true Living God the average person today spends so much time on their cell phone the cell phone has become a good it doesn't sound like the most spiritual thing but it is the truth because when you have to give an account of a versus the bible Spotswood redeeming the time anybody know that scripture time is just going in and you're not doing anything for the kingdom no choice to testify no choice the to spread the gospel do you know you're forgiven account for how you spend every minute of your life from the moment you wake up in the morning the recording is going on of your life what is your excuse what is your story and this is what trust was plannin dear God already took you out of the world he made a way for you you have to make a choice I know it's not the kind of method people love to hear but I know what's on my heart because your choice will reflect itself in your testimony your choices will reflect itself in how you smile your choices at the student you ever tries to study you have a choice I cannot understand how people go to school for five years and leave with nothing five years that's a choice a choice was made is to have fun and I study a choice was made to go with friends and not study a choice was made to break school and not study a choice was made to do all kinds of stuff except what was most important how many of us are guilty this morning of making choices that against our progress spiritually it's a choice an evening to put on a movie or to put on a team it's a choice to pick up a Bible or to pick up a newspaper but the problem is there's no say of the Lord because if people come back to fear in God then every decision would be weighed how will God see this what does God think about this how will God feel about where I'm going this morning but people have lost a fear of God so they walk wherever they want to walk they go every want to go to eat whatever I want to eat it drink whatever they want to drink because they still say of God husband speak to wives however you want to because there is no fear of God why we sponsor husbands anywhere you want to because there's no fear of God children ain't about the parents anywhere they want to because there's no fear of God the interest and the father the mother the child issue is about God I am the Lord I change not and I'm a jealous good I don't want no other copy for me don't shall have no other gods before me if God is going to serve Him serve him on a Monday serve him on a Tuesday serve him on a Wednesday serve him on a Thursday serve him on a Friday silverman and Saturday sell him on your job sell them in your neighborhood sell them in your house sell them when you go down the street serving when you're driving sell them when you're in the maxi summer when people make jokes filthy jokes love him by walking away that's how you serve Him don't you know your party's at a temple of the Holy Ghost [Applause] choose you this day whom you will serve I challenge you to they don't leave this house without making a real choice friends young people your parents have to answer as much as you have to answer it's a tragedy when young people think that's not coming to church it's written their parents what foolishness is the same like a transient I not study enough because my parents want me to do well and I just want the Isaacs with them is I not studying does that make sense choice it's a choice to fight or a choice is to walk away the choice they hit for choice is to love it's your choice you need to have somebody lay hands on you you need to make the right choices your blessing is a result of your choice kings wash when he likes a tool him hit the ground it was his choice the Prophet never told him hit five is six he left it up to him it was his choice and he did it three times and he likes heard I'm angry you should have done it five or six times because if there if I was six time you would have destroyed the enemy but because the only hit three times you will have three

influences so we're going to make it simple because a lot of people hear stuff and it wasn't only how so this one I want to give you the whole ask yourself what the influence who is influencing the action what the objectives of the action what usually happens when people go to places it says us were claim is it doesn't work if there is nothing we're going to have it it's just we just talking about sports the question is is that gonna take it closer to the kingdom or away from the kingdom and it's any path any chance but the Branum said if shunned a theory appearance you don't even have to be evil and give it up here evil walk away from it this very appearance if it might be able see away from it you have a choice with the what you weigh what you watch do you know the eyes is the key to the soul I was sharing but over this these demons in Hollywood have gone so far that it now is a TV show called Lucifer and by the Branum said that when the plagues come the plagues would be torments that are connected to what people would have watched in TV shows and Hollywood has had a concerted effort to desensitize people to the spirit realm so there is a comfortable comfortable to accept these evil devil programs until it doesn't bother you anymore setting people up for the judgments setting people are / torment and you want to walk around understanding that his spirits that are at work and you want to open yourself up to the music to the styles to the fashion not even knowing what caused the style what demon was upon somebody you have a choice son the very appearance of evil why would a Christian listen to music like that where you whatever whirly hairstyle why do you want to have a worldly boyfriend will he go for why you know what the Prophet said under no circumstances should I believe I marry an unbeliever I'm not no circumstances I don't care what it is so people do that it's their choice to make listen you can't blame anybody you can't even blame people for not knowing the wood because you could read the books and if you can't even read it to get a tip and mr. the tip and if you can that you can ask somebody tell me what do the prophecy read it for me slowly you have no excuse it's either you want to be a part of this kingdom or you want to be a church member choose you this day whom you will serve the issue in the children of Israel was not give the women of Israel it was not if they came out of Egypt it was not if God delivered them it was not that God was with it this was already established just against time to remind them it was going to Abraham it was Isaac it was Jacob he brought you out he delivers you blood was put on you you only reason you I hear it because blood was put on your doorpost but and he went you all a different now is different know that God has brought you out now view and the message now you know the truth shows you this be we have to go further don't get strike three times let's finish the devil let's finish the Syrians let's go all the way to perfection let's climb all the way to charity let's become real Christians or no Christians at all I don't have my watch so if it gets too long and you need to go it's alright your choice everything is the choice choose you this day what's important to you to your life there's certain foods you eat it could either help you or it gets leaked you I don't need to be a doctor to know coca-cola not good do I drink coca-cola sometimes but it's a choice even though it's not good for you the doctors not following you everywhere you go and say hey do think that cook pretty cool don't drink water it's still a choice and God gives us that that's what makes life beautiful it's a choice no no no no I don't any time I don't want to wasn't I choose them and have my watch thank you it's a choice to come to church and say you know what to D is the Lord be seven days in a week Monday I think eight always needing people commitment and sacrifice root word for the kingdom of man 40 hours a week solid and some will be honest 60 hours dedicated enough can't miss a deer people with records record they come in today and we'll get unbroken Neverland tap some money what what is your testimony Abraham when I was never late for work but church choice is a choice if you want to preach about choice and decisions it now brings a lifts you up to other with accountability and responsibility it's human nature to pass the blame Adam Adam where though I'm hiding what are you hiding why well and I look at myself in the mirror I reckon I was naked who told you in the kid it wasn't me the woman if wagon is wrong it wasn't me the serpent went to be super nice all right is me it's human nature to blame somebody when I was young I always because there was a brother in a message many many I was here maybe seven eight I remember how old I was and this big brother fifty years old see boy bad Isaac we double coffee Murphy's click my movies and I was so traumatized I had no idea what I saw one and if you mature people or what you believe is with you or people talking is it the way but it's a choice it doesn't matter when you read stories of success and people who made it people went to all kind of and put there people who study with candlelight and got scholarships without electricity by candlelight because they made a decision they made a choice that it did not want to live the way they grew up and the Berenstain time and Chavez give it to every man you ever try 15 but what happens this week and what happens tomorrow at any point in time you can be like the prodigal son he made a choice is it wait a minute even the servants in my father's house even better than this I am making a choice I will arise I will go to my father and say I have sinned but you know what before that the Bible said when he came their senses another problem in many ways we have yet to come to our senses so I pray that this morning we come to our senses to realize that this pigsty that we might be living in it's not the mansion that our Father has and there's food that's stored for us that the craft that has been growing for many many years that is waiting to be killed for when we come back home there's a robe with our name written on it there's a ring of power a sign of adoption as we develop if you could just come to our senses and make a choice I will arise and go back to my son and say Lord I'm I'm coming home I'm coming to my senses I'm coming to a realization that I have the power to make a choice the Holy Ghost comes to take you further the Holy Ghost comes to lead you into all truth the Holy Ghost comma number the brand said after you receive the world goes you make yourself a question so there's still more choices after that because every journey for the pranam a prophet had a choice there were two people in the church making of and God said whatever you see what happened he had a choice maybe say blindly applying him dead they are dead and he said I forgive you he had a choice you have a choice when there's our author calls to come up you have a choice when there's stuff in your life that you feel is overwhelming to bring it to the ministry or you can keep it to yourself what's the sense there's a doctor to go to and you don't want to go to the doctor you have a choice there people who sit home sick you don't want to go end up there that's a choice we have choices this morning the choice when a song leader and singing to free to enter in and sing and if nobody is next to you that your choice or you make a choice under it's your choice you can make a choice when I say with us over to Terry and the Lord I'm not leaving here like that man who said in the time of the prophets Lord if you come back here you I find my bones right here because I'm not leaving here until I get the Holy Ghost that's a choice the musician can get ready choose you this day whom you will serve I pray that in some way this has stirred your heart that you can blame the pasta the elder Deacon your mother your father the church didn't use the government the school system that you have a choice you have a choice in the spiritual evil choice in the natural your choice to have a testimony you have a choice with what you put on Facebook you have a choice for what type of selfie you take you have a choice with how you reflect this name because but the pranam said we ought to be God's advertisement board now God is looking for somebody the sake is his glory and he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he said it was somebody look at this pray that God is still real he's the same yesterday today and forever he's our giving somebody I miss your child you can still worship that's how you are good advertisement boy the Lord gives the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord that's cause advertisement for [Applause] choose you this day whom you will serve friends we need to make the business of the kingdom the most important thing in our lives to many of us we are choosing the world we are choosing our ideas we are choosing our ambitions we're choosing our family we are choosing what we want to do and God is saying I'm a jealous good when will you choose me the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all other things will be added unto you can we put him first can we choose to put emphasis can we choose to put the words verse the word above church the word above group the word above your family that's the choice that we must make your choices you could choose to live but the Branham I believe give the story of the man who was imprisoned and I believe it's General or the president as it were was under battlefield and he couldn't get to the presidential office to put your official seal and the official left ahead and everything but he wrote when he heard about the man you're pardoned and he sent a messenger with the friend or whatever to the manor with a prison did send a message to him and when he brought that paper that a man who was in prison he looked at it to say I don't think this is justice from the president see but it's a plan and you can come out of prison he made a choice when it went to the court to review tea they said a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted and to accept anything it's a choice to accept or reject that man in his condition based on his own perspective of how he thought help would come how he thought his deliverance would come he rejected it it didn't come the way he thought it was it wasn't the kind of service he came for that day so he said you know what that I'll stay in prison and he missed his opportunity for pardon he missed his opportunity for redemption he misses opportunity for healing you mrs. opportunity to step out of the prison and be a free man friends don't make that mistake you have a choice if you don't have the Holy Ghost loafer choice to make that your prayer Mick is it Lord I need the Holy Ghost that's your choice you have a choice with what you asked for but the Branham was speaking about what happened to squirrel then he's sharing it and since the heart you're right is a witness of the conversation she says that's nothing but the truth I'm gonna Brennan turns to her he doesn't just give her somebody say you're the choice what what do you want you want money you want to be healed and she made her choice she said I want the salvation of my two boys throughout every step of your Christian journey you will be confronted with choices and decisions and the measure of a man or woman is those choices and decisions that you make some will be good some will be bad because we are not yet perfect profession as promised but as you walk along the journey we try our very best to make the best decisions that will bring us closer to him because that's the girl friends to be closer to him until one day we look in the mirror and we don't see ourselves but we see Jesus and he can say who are you you are born of my bone you are flesh of my flesh you are spirit of my skirt running upon line precept upon precept because you have been formed into the wood image and your character has been formed I said some time ago about that Jesus learned obedience it was not a gift to him he learned obedience by the thing that he suffered the Bible doesn't tell us what he suffered but he must have suffered a lot just learned obedience friends it's your choice with how much you must suffer to learn obedience or you can choose the Lord I'm ready today to come home I'm ready to leave a worldly high number to leave church behind leave my ideas behind and say Lord as Jesus I don't get some did not my will but thine be done I choose you I
