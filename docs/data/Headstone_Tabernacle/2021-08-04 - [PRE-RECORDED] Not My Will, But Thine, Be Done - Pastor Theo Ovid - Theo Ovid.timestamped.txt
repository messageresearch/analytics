[24:03] verse 39 to 46
[24:06] and also sent john chapter 15. i want to
[24:08] read from verse 1 to 8.
[24:11] luke chapter 22 reading from verse 39.
[24:18] is jesus in the garden of gethsemane and
[24:21] he came out
[24:22] and went and he was warned to the mount
[24:25] of olives and his disciples also
[24:26] followed him
[24:28] and when he was at the place he said
[24:30] unto them pray
[24:31] that you enter nut into temptation and
[24:34] he was withdrawn from them about a stone
[24:36] cast
[24:37] kneeled on and prayed saying father if
[24:39] thou
[24:40] be willing remove this cup from me
[24:43] nevertheless not my will but thine
[24:47] be done and he appeared an angel unto
[24:50] him
[24:50] from heaven strengthening him
[24:54] and being in agony he prayed more
[24:56] earnestly
[24:57] and his sweat was it will great drops of
[25:00] blood
[25:00] falling down to the ground and when he
[25:02] rose up from
[25:03] prayer and was come to his disciples he
[25:07] found them
[25:08] sleeping for sorrow he said unto them
[25:11] why sleepy rise and pray we see
[25:14] enter into temptation and reading from
[25:18] saint john 15 verse 1
[25:20] i am the true vine my father is the
[25:22] husband man every branch in me
[25:24] that bear it not fruit he take it away
[25:26] and every branch that beared fruit
[25:28] he pushed it that he may bring forth
[25:30] more fruit
[25:31] now you are clean through the word which
[25:33] i have spoken unto you

[25:45] the branches
[25:46] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[25:49] same bringing forth much fruit
[25:50] for without me he can do nothing if a
[25:53] man i bite not in me
[25:54] he's cast photos that merge and it's
[25:57] withered
[25:57] and men gather them and cast them into
[26:00] the fire and they're burned if you abide

[26:33] but thine be done and we certainly
[26:36] appreciate the message on sunday
[26:38] have we done enough have we done enough
[26:41] that was
[26:42] such a blessing to me and i um i like
[26:45] that action word have we done not have
[26:47] we heard
[26:48] enough have we done
[26:51] enough now this seems scripture in
[26:54] matthew i just want to read it this is
[26:56] we read it from and that's where i get
[26:58] it from not my will but that be done
[27:00] but in matthew 26 36 to 44 jesus said
[27:03] then come at jesus
[27:04] with them unto a place called gethsemane
[27:06] and said disciples city here
[27:08] while i go and pray under so he took
[27:10] with him peter and two sons of zebedee
[27:12] and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[27:15] then city unto them
[27:16] my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[27:21] even unto death this is the same jesus
[27:23] that multiply
[27:24] bread and fish same jesus that turn
[27:26] water into wine
[27:27] same jesus that raised the dead this is
[27:29] jesus saying my soul
[27:31] suffer even unto death tarry here and
[27:34] watch with me
[27:36] he invited him to watch with him and he
[27:38] went a little further
[27:39] and fell on his face and prayed seeing
[27:42] oh my father if it is be possible let
[27:45] this god pass
[27:46] me nevertheless not as i will but as
[27:49] though wilt
[27:50] and he comment on the disciples and find
[27:52] him asleep and said unto peter
[27:53] what could you not watch with me one
[27:55] hour
[27:57] watch and pray that you enter not into
[27:59] temptation
[28:00] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[28:03] flesh is weak he went
[28:04] away again the second time and prayed
[28:06] saying oh my father
[28:08] if this cup may not pass from me except
[28:10] i drink it thy will be done
[28:13] and he came and found them asleep again
[28:15] for their eyes were heavy
[28:17] and he left them and went again and
[28:19] prayed at two time
[28:21] saying the same words so much for
[28:23] encouragement so much for partners and
[28:25] friends and people who
[28:26] backing you up and supporting you when
[28:29] you come to this spot
[28:31] you know some time ago i preached about
[28:32] the dynamics we'll drive you to calvary
[28:34] and then to the rapture
[28:35] but before you hit calvary there's a
[28:37] stop and get so many
[28:39] there's a journey through this garden
[28:41] called gethsemane
[28:43] and let's let's go to tonight
[28:47] nowhere is adoption identified
[28:51] with with a man's sermon teaching
[28:54] preaching or revelations
[28:58] nowhere in the message you could ever
[29:01] find
[29:01] a man's teaching revelation
[29:05] human information knowledge bringing him
[29:08] to adoption
[29:11] adoption has always been tied to
[29:13] behavior
[29:15] tutoring child training
[29:18] sanctification obedience to the father's
[29:21] will
[29:22] pleasing the father and about fathers
[29:25] business
[29:28] this word will means to want
[29:32] or to choose you have to want it
[29:35] you have to have a desire for the will
[29:37] of god to be in your life
[29:40] to influence your life to take a hold
[29:43] upon your life and people realize
[29:46] and sometimes it's too late that the
[29:48] choices they made
[29:50] they pay the penalty and price of the
[29:52] decisions
[29:53] that they made so we say the seeds of
[29:56] today the fruit of the more the seeds of
[29:58] the day
[29:58] today is the first day of the rest of
[30:00] your life you can't change your past
[30:02] your past is what it is
[30:04] but what you do today or tonight or this
[30:07] very hour
[30:08] could affect your future so you are
[30:11] still in a position
[30:12] to make decisions decisions
[30:16] right decisions hallelujah i love him
[30:19] tonight
[30:20] i believe that this is what lord want me
[30:23] to share with you tonight
[30:25] hallelujah not my will but dying be done
[30:29] done to do it because you could know the
[30:32] will and don't do it
[30:34] the will could be revealed to you and
[30:35] you don't do it you still have to come
[30:38] to terms
[30:39] not just to catch the will but to do
[30:43] the will hallelujah
[30:46] now we read that scripture if you abide
[30:48] in me my words abide with you
[30:50] let me just go back just a little bit
[30:51] dear this part here i'm the true vine
[30:55] my father is the husband man every
[30:57] branch i mean a beard not fruity take it
[30:59] away
[30:59] that is no if or no but
[31:03] so what i want to say to you tonight you
[31:05] have no choice but to produce
[31:08] the object of the gospel is not that we
[31:11] in church
[31:13] the object here is that we bear fruit
[31:16] he's very plain there's no no if it's
[31:18] not a butt or maybe he or any message he
[31:20] don't have that
[31:21] he said my father is a husband man they
[31:23] just have no satanism
[31:25] this year they're not in their business
[31:27] there ain't no temptation they're not
[31:29] that
[31:29] you know this is something completely
[31:31] out of that satan
[31:32] not in the picture here tonight this
[31:35] have to do with

[31:39] husband man
[31:40] every branch in me that bear it not
[31:42] fruit he take it away
[31:44] every branch that buried fruit he purged
[31:46] to bring forth more fruit
[31:49] oh glory to god i see no devil inside of
[31:51] there is not lucy inside of there that
[31:53] just
[31:53] you and god you and the word you
[31:56] and your desire to be fruit bearing oh
[31:59] glory to god and the food the food
[32:01] bearing there's a condition
[32:03] and the condition is leafy about in me
[32:06] and my words abide in you you could talk
[32:09] and yap and say what you want to say
[32:10] but if you abide in me and my words are
[32:13] bad in you
[32:14] then you're in a position to ask
[32:15] whatever you will
[32:17] and it shall not maybe not perhaps it
[32:20] shall be done unto you or give the lord
[32:23] a shout nobody could keep you the bride
[32:25] from that
[32:26] nobody could keep individuals from that
[32:28] that is your word
[32:30] that is your seed that is what your rays
[32:32] are for
[32:33] and then he closed off with hearing is
[32:35] my father glorified
[32:38] that you bear much fruit so shall you be
[32:41] my disciples
[32:42] hearing is my father glorifying
[32:45] so if you want a glorified father it's
[32:47] not just fruit or more fruit is much
[32:50] fruit
[32:51] so god in the improving business the
[32:52] multiplying business
[32:54] the progressing business they add in two
[32:56] business oh glory
[32:58] you can't give god back what you he give
[33:00] you you have to add
[33:01] more an attitude you have to have some
[33:02] interest on top of it
[33:04] that to your feet virtue and knowledge
[33:05] you have to put some things and pile it
[33:07] up
[33:07] on top of that go praise them all
[33:11] you love him tonight so if you don't
[33:13] bear fruit you will be cut off
[33:17] so the objective is to come to spiritual
[33:20] immaturity
[33:21] to be a fruit because a new shoot can't
[33:24] be a fruit
[33:25] it's not mature yet it's not red yet
[33:28] it's not ripe yet isn't that right
[33:32] so god's purpose for us is to be a fruit
[33:36] isn't that right not producing is not an
[33:40] option you will be cut off
[33:43] and the evidence of abiding is the fact
[33:46] that you can ask what you will
[33:48] and it shall be done under you let's
[33:51] continue psalms 40
[33:54] jesus uh psalms 40 sacrifice and
[33:57] offering though does not desire
[33:59] manners has doubt opened burned offering
[34:02] and sin offering
[34:04] has though not required then said i know
[34:06] i come
[34:07] in the volume of the book it is written
[34:09] of me i delight
[34:12] to do thy will oh my god ye
[34:15] thy law is within my
[34:19] has to be in your heart scale upside
[34:22] brought wood as it was in my heart
[34:24] it has to be in your heart to even want
[34:27] the will of god for your life
[34:29] because i'm not doing anybody else no
[34:30] your wife your husband children
[34:32] neighbor church they tell the deacon
[34:34] pastor that's only with them
[34:35] that has to do with you because the will
[34:38] is personal
[34:39] you have a like personal place in christ
[34:42] the will for your life
[34:43] that's for you alone you alone can hold
[34:46] the script of that
[34:47] you alone could hold a revelation of
[34:49] that i can't give you that revelation
[34:51] god have to give you that revelation and
[34:52] you have to find out the will of god for
[34:54] your life and go and do it
[34:56] not just hear it and speak it back but
[34:59] get the job
[35:01] done it's in john 4
[35:04] 4 30 then went out of the city and came
[35:07] up to him
[35:08] and in the meanwhile his disciples
[35:10] prayed him saying master eat
[35:12] and he said to them i have meat to eat
[35:14] that you know not of
[35:15] and therefore said the disciples one to
[35:17] another had any man brought him or to
[35:19] eat
[35:19] and jesus said unto them my need
[35:23] is to do the will of him that sent me
[35:25] and to finish his work
[35:28] so jesus was passionate unto his purpose
[35:31] that he was raised up for he even said i
[35:34] always do that which pleases
[35:36] my father his father already said this
[35:39] is my son in whom i am
[35:41] well pleased so it was a harmony and
[35:43] agreement
[35:44] because jesus uh he's he stood with his
[35:48] father's word
[35:50] isn't that right he said now watch my
[35:52] meat is the dude the will of him has
[35:53] sent me and to finish his work
[35:55] say not e they are four months and yet
[35:57] they come at harvest behold i said to
[35:59] you
[35:59] lift up your eyes and look on the field
[36:02] for they are right
[36:03] already to harvest jesus was here
[36:07] confronting the greatest test that he
[36:10] had ever had gethsemane
[36:13] laid just before him where that once and
[36:16] final
[36:16] all-sufficient tests must come
[36:19] when the burden of the entire world laid
[36:22] upon his blessed shoulder
[36:24] there was no one in all heaven or earth
[36:26] could ever stood it
[36:28] but him and to know this is the burden
[36:31] you know
[36:32] and to know that all of the sins
[36:36] past sins present sins
[36:40] future sins rested upon this decision
[36:47] let me say it again all sins past
[36:50] present future rested upon decision and
[36:53] it was one of the greatest
[36:54] victories that christ ever won or
[36:58] proved his great messiahship as when he
[37:00] said to god
[37:01] not my will thine be done that was
[37:04] the greatest victory he ever won not
[37:08] cast no devils
[37:09] not multiplying bread and fish not doing
[37:11] any kind of mind he works he fell on his
[37:13] face
[37:15] and prayed and that was
[37:19] greatest victory hallelujah
[37:22] it was one of the greatest victory that
[37:24] christ ever won or
[37:26] proved his great message as when he said
[37:28] to god not my will then be done
[37:30] that was the greatest victory ever won
[37:32] all the
[37:33] demons of torment was a wrong to tempt
[37:35] him and the triumph
[37:37] and when we get right with god when our
[37:40] hearts become
[37:41] pure and the holy spirit has taken his
[37:44] place in our hearts
[37:44] it's the most glorious thing to have
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] attested
[37:50] hallelujah the bible said our testings
[37:52] and trials are more precious to us than
[37:54] sylvan goal
[37:55] of this world so we are should be
[37:56] thankful
[37:58] gethsemane he went a little further i
[38:01] like that part
[38:02] there's a whole message myself you went
[38:04] a little further sometimes you have to
[38:06] go a little further
[38:08] further beyond the noise further beyond
[38:11] the family
[38:12] further beyond the voice of the wife or
[38:14] the voice of the husband or the voice
[38:15] the children the voice of
[38:16] competences our neighbors going further
[38:20] are you prepared to go to the freezer
[38:22] the wise version did
[38:24] they went for you don't get extra oil
[38:26] the bride will do
[38:28] more i believe with all my heart
[38:31] he went a little further then we find
[38:33] out
[38:36] i'll just skip that little bit if you
[38:37] make a mistake some woman make a mistake
[38:39] some man made a mistake some boy or girl
[38:42] made a mistake don't sink
[38:43] scream out and disappear lord save me or
[38:46] perish
[38:47] get desperate about it god will hear you
[38:49] he always he has a desperate soul
[38:51] that's what i'm trying to tell you about
[38:54] our dear lord jesus himself
[38:56] in the world greatest battleground
[38:57] gethsemane he cried out in despair
[38:59] should he take the sins of the world or
[39:01] should he just remain on earth with his
[39:02] beloved disciples
[39:04] what he wanted to do but watch his
[39:06] humility
[39:07] as he humbled himself not my will but
[39:09] then be done
[39:10] humble himself to the word the promised
[39:13] word of the god of heaven
[39:15] notice then he went a little further and
[39:17] he went a little further
[39:19] how much more ought we to go a little
[39:21] further and notice the scripture said in
[39:23] luke
[39:24] he prayed endlessly brother sister if
[39:27] jesus
[39:28] had to pray earnestly how much more have
[39:30] we got to pray earnestly
[39:31] if christ the god of heaven made flesh
[39:34] had to pray earnestly then how much more
[39:36] we
[39:36] sinner saved by grace but earnestly if
[39:39] the decisions
[39:41] and this is your thing about the weight
[39:43] how we interpret
[39:44] how we take decisions how we make
[39:47] decisions
[39:47] how we go about choosing and making
[39:50] we're going to do this we're going to do
[39:51] that
[39:51] it's so very important oh hallelujah if
[39:54] the decision
[39:56] prays god throw the son of god into
[39:57] despair what will it do to you and i
[40:00] desperately we must cry oh god are you
[40:04] ready tonight
[40:05] the spirit left him in the garden of
[40:08] gethsemane
[40:12] he had to die a man
[40:16] so that was a real grit and grime
[40:20] and that started off with having a
[40:22] desire and making a
[40:24] choice to do god's will because he had
[40:28] his own will
[40:29] that's why he said not my will but dying
[40:33] be done we could do what we want to do
[40:36] go where you want to go read where you
[40:38] want to greed meet who you want to be
[40:40] choose whatever friends you want to have
[40:42] go and do this and go that's your will
[40:44] that's your choice
[40:45] but his will is different remember you
[40:48] say my thoughts are not your thoughts
[40:49] my ways are not your ways so when the
[40:52] revelation of his will begin to come
[40:53] down to you which
[40:54] will it gonna begin it gonna start it's
[40:57] already started
[40:59] but more will come to you because god
[41:00] has to bring us to a spot
[41:02] and to a place not just us as a group
[41:06] but you as an individual hallelujah
[41:09] nobody can put you in the kingdom you
[41:11] know
[41:11] do you have the press the kingdom is
[41:14] preached but you have to press
[41:15] your way into the kingdom of god do you
[41:18] believe that tonight hallelujah
[41:20] the spirit left him in the garden of
[41:22] gethsemane you have to die a man
[41:24] remember friends he didn't have to do it
[41:26] that was god anointed that flesh which
[41:28] was human flesh he didn't
[41:30] he went up there as god he would have
[41:32] never died that kind of death but can't
[41:34] kill god
[41:35] but remember he went dear with you and
[41:37] him
[41:38] and god had never separated the bride
[41:40] from the groom so when god looked down
[41:42] upon the body of christ he saw both male
[41:44] and female
[41:45] it was all redeemed in one body oh glory
[41:48] to god or his representation
[41:51] in the garden of gethsemane was also
[41:53] representing you
[41:54] so if he could make it so can you if he
[41:56] went through his get sam and he soaked
[41:58] and you
[41:59] because just as he went to cavalry you
[42:00] are yours
[42:02] and you are what you all get 72 by the
[42:04] decisions and choices you make
[42:06] even tonight oh glory to god hallelujah
[42:10] he saw what male and female it was all
[42:11] redeemed in that one buddy
[42:13] they are one same word same word spoke
[42:16] the groom speaks the bride
[42:17] how can the bride come and feel to
[42:19] manifest everything that promised of him
[42:21] and the groom come he wouldn't be the
[42:23] bride it wouldn't be the bride and when
[42:25] he did everything
[42:26] even to proven it by raising from the
[42:27] dead afterwards the bride have
[42:30] to do the same thing have to be the
[42:33] exactly the same word she would be in
[42:35] the last days
[42:36] oh glory to god hallelujah do you
[42:39] believe that
[42:41] so what the elder says when they say who
[42:42] is worthy to take the book on the loses
[42:44] he's there of
[42:45] he said it was non-worthy they said weep
[42:46] not the land of the tribe of judah
[42:48] has prevailed oh glory to god to take
[42:51] the book isn't that right
[42:52] there was one voice came from the elders
[42:54] saying the four beasts don't reap john
[42:56] oh don't be broken-hearted don't weep
[42:58] for the land of the
[43:00] judah the root of offspring of david has
[43:02] prevailed prevail means to wrestle and
[43:04] overcome
[43:05] and the garden of gethsemane is when the
[43:08] blood dropped down from his face
[43:09] he was overcoming oh glory to god think
[43:12] about that
[43:13] when the bible said revelation in the
[43:15] book of symbols when the bible said
[43:16] the language but judah prevailed it was
[43:19] again in gethsemane
[43:20] he was beaten that devil oh glory to god
[43:22] by accepting the choice
[43:24] to pay the price on our behalf oh that's
[43:27] why we should be praising him tonight
[43:28] that's why we thanking him tonight
[43:30] that's how the book get open
[43:32] that's why we could go back to the book
[43:34] of authority and dominion
[43:35] oh glory to god that's why we could
[43:37] claim our redemptive rights
[43:39] because this son that was worthy he
[43:41] would step forward to pay the price
[43:43] oh glory was a blood price and he had to
[43:46] make that decision
[43:47] oh glory to god hallelujah you have to
[43:50] make your decision

[45:55] because he's a spirit
[45:56] but he can work through us to manifest
[45:59] and to do his
[46:00] will what god wants to do with the
[46:03] church tonight
[46:04] he wants to do with an individual is to
[46:07] find somebody the holy spirit is
[46:08] searching
[46:09] to find men he can take him out to a
[46:12] certain place
[46:12] speak to that person anoint them and

[46:38] the kind of misbehavior and whatnot
[46:39] god can't put no gifts and powers on
[46:41] that something has to happen
[46:43] to get the church in condition but
[46:46] there's a prophecy hanging over that
[46:48] that the church will come in condition
[46:50] oh glory to god the condition of the
[46:52] word
[46:52] so if god can't do it to the body oh
[46:55] glory to god

[46:59] and he said oh god can't send a revival
[47:01] he will take individuals
[47:03] and send a revival on individuals make a
[47:05] revival out to you

[47:31] of god i have good acts i
[47:33] cite i have eat drink whatever i have
[47:35] need of he never promised me to supply
[47:37] my wants my needs
[47:38] and if i am cast away at that day
[47:42] and i cannot see where i would be but if
[47:44] i knew that i was wrong

[47:48] want to stay wrong
[47:50] and because that i want to do his will i

[48:01] want to do his will i ask him for
[48:05] something sometime
[48:06] he shakes his head and said no i just

[48:11] always ought to ask
[48:12] thy will be done oh glory to god do we
[48:16] show our love for god

[48:20] the trials he
[48:21] in his wisdom sends our way so when god
[48:24] shakes it until you know you could shout
[48:26] and rejoice as if he said yes
[48:28] because you know that no is the will of
[48:30] god
[48:31] oh glory to god when god shut this door

[48:47] and he said here now they will love him
[48:49] and he
[48:50] they will have his potentials for he is
[48:52] their head
[48:53] and they are subjects to his head his
[48:55] headship
[48:56] notice what harmony jesus never did
[48:59] anything until he seen the father
[49:00] the father showed him that harmony
[49:02] between god and christ ceased in john 5
[49:04] 19 so will be the bride

[53:36] years in silence
[53:37] jesus had to sit down and chill he had
[53:38] to sit down and be quiet in church
[53:40] and wait for the appointed time you

[53:44] come yet
[53:44] you have to wait for john can they pay
[53:46] away oh glory to god from a messiah to
[53:48] comfort
[53:49] 18 years has silenced the way to be 30
[53:51] years old and here come john the baptist
[53:54] anointed on commission
[53:55] from the back side of the desert to
[53:56] introduce messiah oh glory to god and
[53:59] jesus knew the time was at hand
[54:01] for him to step forward to be identified
[54:03] by his witness ministry
[54:05] and when that dynamics came upon him
[54:06] nobody see it but john
[54:08] he saw a dove the one upon whom you see
[54:10] the dove staying and remaining that's
[54:12] the one
[54:12] nobody else saw it and jesus was just
[54:15] walking
[54:15] and led by the spirits into the
[54:17] wilderness to overcome that devil
[54:19] oh glory to god the lust of the eyes the
[54:21] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[54:23] and he overcome lucifer by himself in
[54:26] the wilderness
[54:27] without any demonstration of power only
[54:29] it is written it is written
[54:30] to prove you could stay with the word
[54:32] and overcome by the word
[54:34] oh give the lord a shout in the house oh
[54:37] glory to god the anointing was off of
[54:39] him
[54:39] he was tasting the test and facing it
[54:41] without any set of power and he gave the
[54:43] devil a
[54:44] man a bruised face when he finished with
[54:46] him in the wilderness
[54:48] and then the bible said he returned oh
[54:50] glory give the lord a shout at night
[54:52] he returned in the power of the spirit
[54:55] oh glory to god the spirit hit him come
[54:58] on for him
[54:58] send him to the wilderness and come back
[55:00] upon him vindicating about the spirit
[55:02] when and disguise yourself as the word
[55:04] to give the word test to jesus
[55:06] and you overcome the by the word itself
[55:09] it is written it is written
[55:10] it is also written here this big bomb
[55:13] here they
[55:14] do only his will as a bride
[55:18] only israel
[55:21] no one can persuade them
[55:24] different they have thus saith the lord
[55:29] or they keep still they then they will
[55:32] do
[55:32] the works of god for it is himself
[55:37] in them continuing his word
[55:40] to fulfill as he did complete in his
[55:42] days all things when he was here
[55:45] he did not complete our thing he was
[55:46] here for there was not time yet
[55:48] so he's going to finish the work in his
[55:50] wife
[55:51] oh glory to god so brother brother he
[55:54] was seen here
[55:55] oh my hallelujah oh you love him tonight
[56:00] and then he's talking about adoption he
[56:01] was talking about the purpose is
[56:03] seeing your position in christ seeing
[56:05] it's not something that you just stumble
[56:06] into
[56:07] something that you merited somewhere but
[56:09] it's what god did for you himself
[56:11] not that you were so good and you went
[56:13] to church one night and some porn
[56:15] brother led you to the altar
[56:16] it wasn't that it was god before the
[56:19] foundation of the world
[56:20] predestinated you to eternal life and
[56:23] when you get
[56:24] there that day no wonder 40 24 elders
[56:27] laid on their crowns everybody laid down
[56:28] their crowns everyone fell on their face
[56:30] they didn't have one thing they could
[56:32] say
[56:34] no preacher no elder no nothing all
[56:37] praise to the lamb god will gather in
[56:39] him all things that that day
[56:41] oh if we only know and recognize who he
[56:44] was
[56:45] oh you say we start with the eighth
[56:47] verse wherein he has a boundary towards
[56:48] us
[56:49] in all wisdom and prudence having been
[56:51] known unto us the mystery of israel he's
[56:53] quoted from ephesians
[56:54] the mysteries of israel now remember how
[56:57] we hung onto that
[56:59] how many was here this morning let's see
[57:00] how we stuck on that the mystery of
[57:02] israel
[57:03] no it's not just a little thing then
[57:07] it's a mystery god's will
[57:10] is a mystery and each
[57:13] man has to seek out
[57:17] the will of god for his or herself
[57:22] god's mystery let's go around again
[57:25] god's will
[57:26] is a mystery and each
[57:30] man has to seek out the will of god
[57:34] for his or herself god's mystery
[57:37] so you can't claim god mystery is for
[57:40] you to be in church
[57:42] you have to know why you come to church
[57:44] if all i'm saying now you want deeper
[57:46] than that
[57:46] that you're going to church you want a
[57:48] little more than that what god called
[57:49] you
[57:50] unto because jesus wow
[57:54] i was thinking about that quote where
[57:55] i'm saying the spirit left him in
[57:56] gethsemane
[57:57] i was thinking then all he could rely on
[57:59] of who he was
[58:01] because the anointing but ramos says the
[58:03] help of faith
[58:04] god could drop your anointing upon you
[58:05] and help your faith tonight
[58:07] but real fate is a revelation of who you
[58:10] are
[58:12] so when jesus said uh no man eat of thee
[58:15] he knew who he was he crucified me
[58:17] that's his real fate he he's saying that
[58:20] not because he's feeling
[58:25] it's because of who he is he can speak
[58:28] and that's where the bride will come to
[58:30] that is we're going to blow the
[58:31] pentecostal mind because they might have
[58:33] waited for another
[58:33] thing and thing and doing this and what
[58:35] kind of stinging day and
[58:37] all kind of carrying on but this bribe
[58:39] will just be speaking
[58:41] hallelujah and the authority and the
[58:43] revelation of the faith that is inside
[58:45] of you
[58:46] oh glory to god nothing could stop that
[58:47] you know that's superior that'd be god
[58:49] see
[58:50] that'd be god speaking and you wouldn't
[58:52] be saying in jesus name because it would
[58:53] be you would be in jesus
[58:56] when you speak is his name hallelujah
[58:59] you'll be speaking in his name just the
[59:01] word
[59:02] healed see
[59:05] hallelujah dumb speak
[59:10] that's adopted son that is christ
[59:14] reproduce again you know that is the
[59:15] reproduction of the original grain
[59:18] oh glory to god hallelujah oh praise god
[59:22] you love him tonight
[59:24] hallelujah let's continue my my my my my
[59:29] and when he was um teaching them to pray
[59:32] matthew 6 he said after this manner
[59:33] therefore pray he
[59:35] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[59:36] be thy name
[59:38] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[59:41] earth
[59:41] as it is in heaven that's the first
[59:44] thing he said your kingdom come we're
[59:45] expecting that kingdom to come
[59:47] we're letting you know that your will
[59:48] will be done and eat
[59:50] as it is revealed in heaven oh my
[59:53] give us this day our daily bread and
[59:55] forgive us our debts
[59:56] as we forget we give our debtors and
[59:59] leaders not into temptation
[1:00:01] but deliver us from all evil
[1:00:06] for thine is the kingdom the power and
[1:00:07] the glory forever and ever amen for if
[1:00:09] you forgive men that trespasses
[1:00:11] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:00:13] you but if you forgive
[1:00:14] not mend the trespasses neither will
[1:00:16] your heavenly father
[1:00:18] forgive your trespasses and god put
[1:00:20] brotherly kindness
[1:00:22] right at the top right on this age
[1:00:25] when the prophet said the bride will
[1:00:27] display the blood of her age
[1:00:28] so therefore the blood of brotherly
[1:00:30] kindness will be the voice of the
[1:00:32] bride's voice in this hour
[1:00:34] god put it there he put it there and put
[1:00:36] fear to be there
[1:00:37] because our heart turned back to the
[1:00:38] fate of the fathers so right on top of
[1:00:41] their brotherly kindness
[1:00:42] and then our fate is based upon
[1:00:44] forgiveness so it's still come
[1:00:46] where there has to be a manifestation of
[1:00:49] destroyed of forgiveness upon a bride
[1:00:51] that will drive you to forgive and drop
[1:00:53] your oars and to be humble
[1:00:56] knowing that faith to pull down the cap
[1:00:59] the thing to take us out the thing that
[1:01:02] can't feel
[1:01:03] faith to do that is based upon this
[1:01:05] vigorously talking about here
[1:01:07] so god allow a lot of issues family
[1:01:09] issues church issues
[1:01:10] business issues what kind of issues over
[1:01:12] the years to
[1:01:13] build up and grow and everything else
[1:01:15] and people take the going down the road
[1:01:16] thinking they could go on their own it's
[1:01:18] not working that way there is one lord
[1:01:21] there is one feat there is one body
[1:01:25] all praise the name of the lord do you
[1:01:26] believe that tonight
[1:01:28] so jesus did the works of his father
[1:01:32] because the father was in him that is
[1:01:35] why the works was done
[1:01:37] because the father was in the sun do you
[1:01:39] believe that
[1:01:41] he was the incarnate god and that god
[1:01:44] the father which is the father of jesus
[1:01:46] christ the great spirit
[1:01:47] dwelt in the fullness of his power in
[1:01:50] jesus christ
[1:01:51] which was the tabernacle of god made
[1:01:54] flesh
[1:01:54] and dwelt on earth representing the word
[1:01:58] and jesus was the word and the bible
[1:02:01] said
[1:02:02] the words in john 1 the word was
[1:02:04] invisible now listen
[1:02:06] close the word was invisible
[1:02:09] until it was made flesh and when the
[1:02:13] and then the word become visible and
[1:02:16] through
[1:02:17] his sacrificial death at calvary and his
[1:02:20] resurrection
[1:02:22] positionally placed his church
[1:02:25] in that realm that the same
[1:02:28] invisible god could come
[1:02:31] into the individual and make the world
[1:02:35] visible
[1:02:37] hallelujah i wish my church could get
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:41] if you could see it friends the
[1:02:43] invisible god made visible
[1:02:45] let's say that part again and through
[1:02:47] his sacrificial debt
[1:02:49] at calvary and his resurrection
[1:02:54] positionally placed his church in that
[1:02:56] realm
[1:02:57] that the same invisible god could come
[1:03:00] into the individual
[1:03:02] and make the word visible how
[1:03:06] sin john 15 if he
[1:03:10] abide in me and my word
[1:03:14] abide in you you can ask what you will
[1:03:19] and it shall be done unto you
[1:03:22] for when omnipotent speak
[1:03:25] the miraculous have to take place
[1:03:30] because omnipotence is god himself
[1:03:33] so a man can't claim to be veiling this
[1:03:36] omnipotence and there is no miraculous
[1:03:39] that doesn't even make sense once
[1:03:43] omnipotent speak the miraculous
[1:03:48] must not maybe not perhaps
[1:03:53] must i want to say must
[1:03:56] must if omnipotence is speaking
[1:04:00] which is god the word made flesh
[1:04:03] that means the spirit itself the father
[1:04:06] is speaking to the son the word
[1:04:09] hallelujah must take place
[1:04:12] oh glory to god that's why jesus could
[1:04:15] tell his disciples by prophecy
[1:04:18] and by inspiration the same works that i
[1:04:21] do
[1:04:22] shall you do also because it shall come
[1:04:24] to pass
[1:04:25] this word will be abiding in you and my
[1:04:28] father and i
[1:04:30] at that day you shall know because i am
[1:04:32] going to come into you
[1:04:34] and activate the word in you to make you
[1:04:37] reproduce what i did
[1:04:38] you're going to do also it is impossible
[1:04:41] for it not to happen
[1:04:42] oh glory to god i come to do thy will oh
[1:04:45] god
[1:04:45] as it is written of me in the volume of
[1:04:47] the book and the book was unsealed
[1:04:50] and the volume has been unveiled that we
[1:04:53] can know what the will of god is
[1:04:55] to go and do it oh you say what we see
[1:04:58] should make a church
[1:04:59] that will make a revival that people
[1:05:01] should fly from everywhere saying the
[1:05:03] seven thunders that are written
[1:05:04] is being made manifest oh glory to god
[1:05:08] we have to make a revival a church that
[1:05:10] will see that they call to make this
[1:05:12] revival
[1:05:13] people don't want it they laugh at it
[1:05:14] that's okay but we're gonna have a
[1:05:16] bright revival
[1:05:18] even a seven thunder revival oh glory to
[1:05:21] god hallelujah i'm almost done believe
[1:05:23] it or not hallelujah
[1:05:25] oh god i'm excited tonight i come to the
[1:05:28] bible of god as a written of me
[1:05:30] glory to god a prophecy came over the
[1:05:32] prophet
[1:05:34] night hallelujah and this is what it was
[1:05:37] february 11 1961 because that was chosen
[1:05:42] the narrow path because that was chosen
[1:05:46] the narrow path the hardaway
[1:05:50] though was walked of your own choosing
[1:05:53] oh glory to god when jesus was wrestling
[1:05:55] with this human spirit if it's possible
[1:05:58] let this god pass him not once he prayed
[1:05:59] on his three times
[1:06:01] he was wrestling it's a choice
[1:06:04] hallelujah sometimes that choice is not
[1:06:06] the devil and the devil and the devil is
[1:06:07] you
[1:06:09] your choice you're choosing
[1:06:12] what you decide you want to read where
[1:06:15] you want to go what you want to say
[1:06:16] how you want to see your choice
[1:06:21] before i say because that was chosen the
[1:06:24] narrow path
[1:06:26] the harder way that was worked
[1:06:30] of your own choosing in other words
[1:06:33] i didn't have to do it i consider and go
[1:06:35] with them if i want to but i stayed with
[1:06:37] the word
[1:06:38] that was picked the correct and precise
[1:06:41] decision
[1:06:42] and it is my way hallelujah
[1:06:46] if you notice it punctuated and
[1:06:48] underlined if you notice
[1:06:49] it wrote in french spoken french he said
[1:06:52] because of this momentous decision
[1:06:55] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[1:07:00] because of what a momentous
[1:07:04] decision there is power in choice
[1:07:10] not my will but i will be done
[1:07:14] there is power in what you choose
[1:07:17] choose ye tonight who you want to serve
[1:07:21] you want to serve your own feelings or
