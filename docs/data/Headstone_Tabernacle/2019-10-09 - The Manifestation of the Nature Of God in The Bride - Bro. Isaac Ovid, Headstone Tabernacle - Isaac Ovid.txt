are the same yesterday you are the seem too dear you are the same forever Lord and whatever we are going through doesn't change the fact that you are still a present tense God doesn't change the fact that you are still a miracle-working God doesn't change the fact that you are still moving and you're still operating you are still healing you are still sealing you are still baptizing you are still restoring you're still casting out Devils you're still healing home that healing lie Lord tonight we come as a needy people though we come father looking for something more tonight we come looking to our greater connection of a deeper walk with you a deeper talk with you we want to hear direct from you tonight you know what I hear from man but we want parents walking words to move in this house tonight so father God may you take me out of the way may you speak to your people may you bless us tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen and amen I greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ and it's so good to be here this evening in the name of the Lord and in the house of the Lord looking for gotta do something for us and see something to us and and move in our hearts in a way that of the years he has not done before because he's a God of increase he likes to do more than he did yesterday our walk with Him should be greeted and it was yesterday greeting and it was the week before can the church say Amen so I just want to take one portion of scripture tonight reading from second pizza one and reading from verse one for text a night greetings to those who are connected on the internet tonight may God bless you in a special way and you have a time in the Lord and in this season amen so reading from 2nd Peter 1 and reading from this one Simon Pizza a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith so he's not speaking to any and everybody but he's speaking to them who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God not not the own righteousness but the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that the teen unto life and godliness his divine power hath give past tense all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us so this is the definition of these all things whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by visa might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ my Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening in the precious name of the Lord and we are gonna have a grand time in the law this evening you believe that I know the weather report said that things should have been a little rainy today but God allowed us to make it here this evening and because he did that is because he wants us to be here this evening amen if you here this evening is because God wanted you to be here to be blessed and if you couldn't make it for some reason then we thank God that he allows us as when the Prophet was here and he put things on the recorder we have recording equipment as well so you could not only hear it afterwards but you could hear it while it's going on as well can a church say Amen so for a text tonight the manifestation of the nature of God in the bride the manifestation of the nature of God in the bride I'll see one more time the manifestation of the nature of God in the bride and it's a powerful thing because everything can be tied back to Genesis and when Adam existed alone god looked at Adam and said it's not good for man to be alone so he put Adam to a deep sleep and out of this deep sleep he pulled a woman he pulled a rib out and he pulled the female element out of this spirit man that was Adam that he put flesh on he pulled that out and when Adam woke from his sleep and he looked at her he said this is flesh of my flesh this is bone of my bone I know without a shadow of a doubt that you came from me he was looking at part of himself in that so he knew that that was connected to him and it has to come a point in our journey with God and as you become introduced to your husband there is a change that has to take place that he can begin to speak back to you and say this is flesh of my flesh this is bone of my bone this is spirit of my spirit the same words that I said that I'm gonna do I see you doing so you must be the one you must be born of my bone and flesh of my flesh and spirit of my spirit because when I look at you I'm seeing part of me when I look at me and I look at you I'm seeing me and I'm seeing you and I that day you wanna know that I'm in the Father hear me and I am you it's gonna be hard to differentiate between Christ and his bride because the two become one when they see me they see the father when they see you to see your husband and the church hmmm so there has to come something that will bring about a manifestation of the nature of God in his bride right now our nature is our own nature our behavior is our own behavior our attitudes our own attitudes we can tell you apart from the person next to you because of your nature we know who like booth this way and who like to do things that way even if you don't see somebody the way they walk speaks to their nature can the church say man your body language if it's dark and the light is off just the way you slow to certain way that identifies who you are there has to be something that comes upon us something that comes in us that it will take note that you've been with Jesus there's got to be something that come over you that your neighbor has to say I know this fella but this nature that I'm seeing I don't know this one he looks like how he used to look but the nature his nature is different this attitude is different his behavior is different the words he is using different than the church semen Oh hallelujah the manifestation of the nature of God in the bride because the scripture II read said why whereby we are given unto us great and exceeding precious promises our joy this evening is not just in the of what we have experienced already we have a joy in promises that are going to be fulfilled we have a joy in these exceeding great it's not just promises but it's great promises all of it you may not understand yet but but the right is trying to make it clear to you that it's exceeding great and precious promises that these promises is what makes us partakers of the divine nature of God so when you hear promise of restoration of your gray hair to black that's one of those exceeding great promises when you hear about the restoration but the terrors of your eyes that's an exceeding great promise that's not the ordinary promise normal promise it up it have different levels of promises we talk about the exceeding promises like change our body and they exceed and promise when these 16 elements will shake themselves and put on a new body that's eating clear promise and the church team and these old bones when they're gonna get changed hallelujah somebody say man exceeding great promise some of your families you may have given up on them in your heart but there's an exceeding great promise it's a precious promise don't let go of the promise don't drop the promise don't lose the promise God that promise protect that promise keep that promise it's an exceeding great promise it's a precious promise protected defendant in that promise is your family in that promise is your healing in that promise it's a seventh on the revival hallelujah your son's name is written in that promise hallelujah hallelujah you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is upon you the promise is unto you and to your children all of those promises are your promises it's to you and to your children it's exceeding great promises and these promises because yes because the promise is given to you the promise is not given to everybody you know but the kindly it's not to everybody whereby are given unto us these promises were just handed of randomly to everybody these promises will not come upon a tree but people go and pick the promise these promises landed with your name given unto us you couldn't take it listen you couldn't take the promise it had to be given unto you somebody gives you the promise somebody give you the promise I have news for you tonight I didn't give you the promise the preacher can't gives you the promise I wanna read it one more time PETA is anointed PETA is inspired I don't know if I have 78 pitches it's not all for tonight I promise you that but this is Pete one which is on the scripture Simon Peter a servant an apostle he has a dual description he has a dual ministry and he puts servitude before his position he is firstly a servant and after his seven ministry is fulfilled now he could be an apostle so he makes it very clear servant he's a servant of the people he's a servant of the Cross he's a servant of this cause he is there to serve because they're people that need serving but beyond the ministry of servitude by the currents he's also an apostle he didn't make himself an apostle he didn't put in an application to be an apostle he didn't request Apostleship it was given to him hallelujah and that's the difference between the fivefold ministry and everybody else I can tell you tonight not every preacher is in the fivefold ministry because God is giving to the church it's one of the gifts that he gives he himself he is handling this ministry God Himself is the giver a lot of people know their gifts but I don't know that Giver he's the one giving so Peter is speaking from a position of authority because he know what he received he knows what he believed he understands his commission he understands who appointed him he understands who place him and the church Damon Oh hallelujah to them they have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you that's what we need to talk to one another not just god bless you grace and peace be multiplied little multiplied in your life let peace abound in your life let grace multiply in your life when you go to work tomorrow let peace multiply on your job when you go home as healing like grace and peace multiply amongst your family let them know that you come different because grace and he is pronouncing a blessing over you [Music] [Applause] not just Grace and peace unto you but it's through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord people know Church but they're known oh Jesus people know the message but they don't know the one who wrote the message they hear the message but the message was to connect us to the messenger and the messenger was the one who cut it from the one who send the message in the first place can the church taemin according as his divine power so I want to make a point here this evening if you would indulge me that it's nothing you could have done to get this thing that I'm talking about tonight no one has achieved this no one has earned this nobody has attained this but according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that put in unto life and godliness in other words all things that deal with the natural and the spiritual life and godliness he has already given us that's true the knowledge of him that I'll call us to glory and to virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great can I take my time this evening exceeding great and precious promises that by these same promises he might be partakers of the divine nature so every promise that you consume every promise that becomes evidence in your life every promise that comes manifested in your life means you are no party and you are now experiencing the divine nature but for most of us what we have experienced has been on the external we have seen God move in different ways but we are going beyond that because his nature is trying to press himself into us so there has to be a move from the external to the in what can the church say man that he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and these are familiar scriptures to us and besides this so he say in addition to that giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge on to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and the colonists brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you not just be in you and abound follow me must be operating it must be evidence it must be living it must be breeding it must be moving they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say Amen amen amen now everything has a nature when it's over the nature of something you are referring to the inherent character or basic constitution of a certain thing that's the nature of the thing when you're born in this world and I'm experienced in this journey with my daughter and I see she really has a personality she already you see in this personality she already has done it you're sure it has a way she wants to do things to my wife she has lips being stored up in deposit just you gotta know but that behavior that meet you is really something else and the thing about it is that that we come to identify ourselves by who we are some of us we are we are smiley people some of us consider ourselves extroverts some say we are my interval that's my nature don't put me further anybody laughter mind me just not how I am so when God tell them go out and when I'm preach the gospel I would not believe that all the disciples were were extroverts but there have to be a change I come upon them that they can see let me forget them the things that I passed and my own nature because now I have a commission well III are you ready for that particular come I don't want to testify to nobody you know because I no no no no it had to be something come over them that their nature was different your nature is your be easier it's what you are made of I'm gonna bend over God being identified by his characteristics so your behavior tells what you are your nature tells what you are the pastor says it all the time you are who you are when you are by yourself we all know it you are who you are when you alone that's your nature you know when you go all by somebody and it finished and I get a copy do you rush you rush to wash your Coppola it's looking good you want to get points you know I watch more couple home what's wrought what cup a whole different cool everything whenever I said that's really who you are you take your real form you take your real sheep take your real you know when you take Ollie Ollie ollie I always say to analysis is a lot of good actors if the Awards the Academy Oscars or whatever the world ever acted was I handled a really did you really come here this that's enough here because people could be here themselves on you could you could you could act us into it only for so long but they say after time after time didn't I don't know you can't perform listen listen it became difficult for Judas after Ellen after is a because something was in him that and he had a destiny if he couldn't get away from and that's why we say there are people who convert children and they and they they backslide and the court decided to believe any more they were never completed their nature was never changed so they behave a certain way and they could do it something for years but after a while but the currents the acting of this get tired and situations will come to reveal what your true nature is the issue is that the revealing of your nature the issue is when the nature is uncovered to see funny what's there it is it Christ because you can see anything you can you can put on any show but in this season we are living in it's the unveiling of who you really are because who you really are is what is eligible or not eligible to make the rapture and the church seaman hallelujah the books are the books the tapes other teams the Bible is the Bible but until your nature becomes this Bible you have no rapture to go to come on now somebody preached back to me because God has a nature his world has a nature hallelujah that's why brother Branham said whenever you come to the house of God you either get better or you get worse because the word the nature of the word is to always bring change the world has a nature Jesus has a nature and the church a man birds have a nature you never see nobody here bird sing sad see but I'm running up with a buddypress boy only if I would shake your hand but but outside of the nature for Buddhism being untruthful nobody but for this morning I feel like singing the moment they wake up anymore then nature it's an unknown sense of new day something has a beer all with the chicken if the chicken wake up and I start to make noise anymore nning the needs of a chicken is normally sunlight breaks he's not a half church he's not to make noise because it's his nature and a real Christian has a nature a real Christian the worship they wake up in the morning that nature begets a live itself out come on now somebody preach back to me and this this nature is a growth because we heard it last Sunday member the owner was preaching but about making yourself a Christian so it means that this new pope is placing his nature in the small form that has to grow up into maturity and the church amen so now the tutor is now watching how you grow it to see how the nature will evolve if you're gonna add in fill in a diode if you wanna change your nature if money comes at you if you wanna change your nature if somebody talk bad about you if your niche you're gonna gonna now conform to respond to what they see because it's a test of nature it's a test of your behavior it's a test of your character it's a test of your attitude can the church even so your haircut reflects your nature the clothes you wear reflects your nature I don't need to wonder what you believe because it was sure after a while your nature will reveal itself kanna-chan say man I heard a story like you know in this in Chapter fact-check everything gothic news anything but I heard of story so I do some research and it seems to be you know so lady got a snake didn't type of snake and I really don't understand anything him behind it but she said it was a petty so she decided by a punch to keep this pet snake in her room nothing I can't do anything in your room eventually the pet snake not the light or any bed with her she was feeding the snake feeding me snake and then after a while he sneaked stop eating so do you want no food day - no food no food so she decided to go by the vet you see I have this she says I have this kind of snake and it was good all the time it's growing I was feeding it it was lying on a normal night anything the doctors had asked some questions how much there is at night in she about three forties does it lie down makes you say yes does it lie don't say it makes you well let me tell you what going on that snake is preparing its measuring you it's making sure that there's room so when you're ready to eat you it will do what it does so he does it that's you're wrong pet that's not a pet because the nature of that snake is to not eat for a while to make sure it has room so it was fortunate that you went in time before it finished reached the process of the measurement and I wondered or other thing I could do it but it was only a matter of time before they need you would have been revealed and it would have been maybe a different story but if one I want to make his animals have a nature the nature for trees to do a certain thing and every time something goes outside of its nature it's considered abnormal and this is why young people if you are predestinated your nature is already connected to a certain thing you know and every time you have a fiddle in the world you know become abnormal and I preach many many on people this living in Churchill have any wool is the most horrible expert you'll ever have it like because your outfit you could never fit in the world you try to fit so you try this I see it's like that down jacquard dance he tried to sing you can sing these you can fit in and because you have certain trappings of the world when they tried to come in church your car worship because it didn't gone them and you're living there nice balance because you're fighting against the nature can the church say Amen hallelujah hallelujah the nature of a situation in nature of things God has a meteor it's not on nature like the way we have nature because if God's nature was like our nature we in real trouble the way we behave God behave the way we behave forget it we have to thank God at his nature's divine we have to tango because we struggling to forgive for little small things and what Gore could hold against us is a good thing his ditches divine because it is divine for him to forgive and he's trying to get us to tap into that divine nature so we could forgive like he forgive because if we don't forgive then his nature doesn't even allow him to forgive because his natives are tuned to see him forgiveness displayed she said how could you be forgiven if you didn't want to release somebody you have to get His divine nature for His divine nature to be clearly reveal in your life come to church amen hallelujah the divine nature of God it's so wonderful that it could overlook your faults the divine nature of God to overlook your mistakes so you will find that when you begin to live His divine nature you begin to overlook certain things things don't bother you the way they used to bother you because God doesn't get bothered by every mistake you may that's why he put blood there His divine nature put a blood pumper that he don't even want to see your mistakes every day when the Prophet had the experience and he was condemning the woman and God open his eyes destroy him when the blood pumper was doing he saw every mistake functional God wasn't even seeing it that's a niche of God hallelujah the nature of quarters and see the possibility the nature of God is to see the possibility like some sort of possibility that's the divine nature of God no matter how things get no matter how low things get the divine nature of God brought him in front of Lazarus and when everybody else was crying the divine nature said Lazarus come forth that's a divine niche and I'm talking about the divine nature could go to that woman who they're about to stone and sing he without sin cast the first stone he was playing an advanced chess game with them because he is divine nature made a way for her and didn't make them people even feel but I see who have seen Cassie first stone and one might wanna make excuse the divine nature of God I'm by these precious promises all these promises we hear preach service after service it is to make us partakers of his divine nature the patek means to share to take part to experience something to longer to have a portion to have a have a portion of this thing partakers of the divine nature to get a share of this attribute that's why see because I live you can live also he is speaking about sharing his divine nature the same works I do you shall do also God once please honey not trying to keep it himself enough he wants you to share of this divine nature Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the joy that he has you're gonna have not your kind of joy but his panitch oh he said my peace I give to you oh come on now come on now shed somebody partakers of his divine nature his nature is a nature of power his nature is love because he is love come on now hallelujah to be like Jesus to walk like Jesus to talk like Jesus to live like Jesus to be able to forgive like Jesus to heal like Jesus to push black devils like Jesus that's what his nature makes him - makes you - makes me - your nature is your life it's what your behavior is that's what we're we said what we need in jeffersonville is thousands of lives that's the fun that'll change the devil oh the devil knows that nature the devil knows that behavior can the church say man so when you hear surveillance you can be grumpy you can be frustrated because that is not his nature he's not frustrated is you no worries us in his name is don't worry he's not worried that's why when imagine he bring Moses out many people out he do miracles and Moses after all of us at the cry when he see fira behind they say mounted on both sides and we say after all I do that is the best lesson you can do go ahead to rebuke him why cry I've already shared my nature with you it's because you partook of my nature you were able to do what you did you already have enough of my nature to take action any situation you speak you speak and move forward you speak and move forward because every service every book every tip every file every experience is you taking a part of his nature until one day you'll need to UM be no more and his nature alone will be visible and untapped eh it'll be a manifestation of the nature of God in his pride hallelujah you may be seated Jesus could have could have said you know what I'm gonna come and finish this battle but he had so much confidence that this bride will adopt his nature then he feels confident to say this bride will have the final knockout punch she will be a super church she will be a super race that strength is not how old strength but she will have the very nature of God and the church say man no one you can see right now you lay hands on the sick but when that time comes when my nature is in you when the world looks at you want to see me in you you don't have to lay hands on the sick anymore you speak to the devils and the devils have to go because it's the same nature then the church say man who do you see this's the divine nature of God hallelujah hallelujah and every scripture you read every year of the Bible David Moses Joshua Elisha every single prophet have been in contact with the nature of God because once you come in contact with God your behavior changes it's impossible for you to meet God any behavior remain the same impossible it's impossible but the price is impossible so everybody benefits too much about a burning bush experience all Moses intellect everything he had a burr when he came into contact with a pillar of fire the man who walked down the mountain was a very different man who went up to mountain and what it is he will have your own mountain experience with your pillar of higher experience it'll be between you and God this has nothing to with anybody else this is not you and the church it's not you and the pasta this is you and God because God is longing for that individual relationship he wants to perform the surgery he don't want no other doctor operate in your heart you don't want no man inside your heart he wants to take full control of your heart of your life of your mind of body and the church semen Oh hallelujah but the Branham was a partaker of his divine nature to have the privilege to see into the mind of God see things like God because the way God sees is not the way we see so as per the panama's caught up in the nature of God he will see things differently and we heard it a believer of I read it on Sunday that in so much that the nature of God and the Prophet because it wasn't him doing it made it so that you could not tell the difference between his enemies and his friends that wasn't that occu will know somebody genuine I know you will know you will know because acting like I tell you woody for so long you let's drop out the car tear somebody's forget what rule in some ways forget your script mean professional just forget the script and as happy bloopers know how they make a mistake because they they drop out a character and some of us we has acted with act different for a wife or a husband everybody woke up they were Freddy Deacon different for our friends so much rose and somebody gets confused who we are today who am i today identity crisis and that's a challenge today young people they don't know who they are they want to beat this one they want to be that one they want to be the other one living on the and influence and influence because with the man improving there's two influences above or below all these characters all these different is what you want to reiterate havin it have unlimited counterfeit that's why I'm banking the car teach you how much counterfeit look at this wrong if you look at this trumpet you will never finish so the focus is nobody real delay is you see this study this study this well because if you know what this is you will recognize every counterfeit because somebody will go and try something new but if you stick to what this real thing is so there's one genuine real Holy Ghost there's one genuine baptism there's one genuine revival there's one genuine Church there's one genuine well there's one right but the brother said every touches such as certain rides right but the must come one that's got mechanics and dynamics and the church seamen the power of God moving in huh Oh hallelujah I'm not talking about this church now I'm talking about the church triumphant there's one church as one bride as one people yes one body and that body will not be manhandled that body cannot be fenced one squad drops his nature in these sons and daughters and they catch a revelation of who they are and whose they are no man could hold them no church could hold them no group could hold them because they are Upward Bound they are not bound by walls up what bound up yeah going vertical and the church hey man do you want to go for tikka do you want to go up do you want to leave this place the divine nature of God God is a spirit so when you talk about the divine nature we're talking about the spirit around we're talking about this this a prophet call it Widow but it's flesh man that always giving trouble boot over the spirit man who you really are and the church see men do you that we don't see all the time but do you that's real you that's awesome enter new party at your ffunny that's the man we preach into tonight because that man has to bring this flesh man under subjection that man have to bring these talks on the subjection I love what better oh love reached the tipping between your thinking on your thoughts or kind of thoughts in your mind a devil push thoughts in you but you control your thinking I'm thinking about the revival oh the lever put toss you copy you're busy copy I'm thinking that key is gonna supply my knee that's what I'm thinking about right now I don't care what taught you put in my mind tired you're tired I'm thinking one day these bones are gonna get a new body one of these pieces more to put them that's what I'm thinking about I'm thinking about my family I'm thinking about my loved ones I'm thinking about talking to David I'm thinking about talking obsessed I can the church say Amen to [Music] [Applause] define nature of God all your thoughts all of our thoughts God sees resources on every thought that flashed your mind God has accessed it if he don't think his own thinking and he dwell on your thoughts mean trouble because he's exposed to all our thoughts he's exposed to all of our desires he's exposed to when you're weak and when you're strong but he's not dwelling on your thoughts his thinking is about where you're going he's thinking about it's about why you wrote your name in blood and even when you fall he's thinking cause but how he sees you making it over on the other side and he has confidence as they come on get back up you're gonna have a Reviver get back up you're gonna get the Holy Ghost get back up that's not who you are that's not your nature that's a spirit upon you but once that spirit comes off of you the real you the real nature the real speed and the soul because that's who you are your name in the book of the literal name but the mystery of who you are hallelujah your nature is a mystery Jesus Christ nature is a mystery how you could explain God it's a mystery you can't even try to explain it for her centuries and centuries in no code and this way to know God and this woman no god I said but when Jesus came that was Christ was trying to reveal the mystery of God for the first time that they had gotten up America touch and talk to and 99% didn't even realize that the god of the Old Testament was walking amongst them the revelation of this God is revealing of this very of God who they wanted to understand they could not come into contact with it even when he was there oh come on now somebody please back to me but it Terence everyone in that day knew the stories about how God visited Abraham and how God came to Isaac and oh Gordon tells me Jacob and Israel and he knew it am i tempt Jesus him all of the behaviors that he will count him as God have wrapped themselves up in Jesus the very nature of God was in front of them and they could not equate the equation they mr. humility the mist the simplicity confuse them the way he moved even Judas had to come and kiss him on his cheek because I couldn't tell this great mystery that was there you couldn't tell that it was deity you couldn't tell deity from pizza can the church say Amen God veil themselves in simplicity and took a handful of people like Peter who had his ups and downs I love Peter I've talked by its harbor Eclipse to have favorite Bible characters it's really difficult but if I have to if I take one in the Old Testament I want to use New Testament but a Jason if you ax were Isaac's favorites is hard to get I like David Wright Peter because these brothers kept it real not that there wasn't others who didn't keep it real but it's just that we have so much information about it the event was quick Lord how they increase that trouble me go ahead trouble and trouble he wasn't like heaven on over to tell nobody anyway when they will feel like tear a seal or restore to me the joy I lost but joy of my salvation yeah people coming to church the joy because they don't know where they found it where they left it when but didn't even cry Laden lorry stole my joy leave it didn't lose his salvation you know but there was a step you see by the antennas commander church with a step you know just walk in the church he there's an excitement he woman he hid that he's at the chip where as I saw someone fast on he tripping because I step he lives on I was glad when they 17 let us go into the house of the Lord you don't have to wonder what I scoop tell me when you look up at an time because he's a living reflection of that scripture and the reality is when you read about the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11 listen these all obtained a good report and they didn't even see the promise but their report cards just having you the report cut out of here they got the a performance impact and behavior DF it blotted out their mistakes dfv blotted out their transgressions and in the Bible a of able to be redeemed by fate not obtaining the promise what promise this promise of the Holy Ghost so let me ask you this question if without the Holy Ghost they could have a good report what I know we are going right what is your excuse because they didn't have access to the promise but now we have good report plus the promise we have access to manifest board but kindly good report and the promise deal live with what they had is the common and had a good report by feet by feet then sheepskin who hunted persecuted and with the situation they had and as I say life is about within the limitation of different resources that's life that's what life isn't all the old people didn't know the simple listen all I have like the woman that Eli Joanne - I didn't have oil and flour our normal resources that working with this is how much time I have to live with and if you ever say well bake me a cake with she was working with her resources and when she picked a kitchen and later this man who eats it as a different kind of man and the Bible says her resources didn't run out but she was prepared to work with her resources and in that didn't have access to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was only important after Jesus came so they had a report without the Holy Ghost that was so powerful that they made it into Hebrews 11 and many of us yes we are looking for the Holy Ghost but the reality is our behavior could have more feet because it makes fear to activate the promise many of us see we wait and we wait in religion and develop and said God is written because me it makes you go into action we put you into prayer feet lets you start a revival because faith without works is dead so you have to have enough fear to go into action and say I'm doing this and that's God's nature that is nature being Express come the church say man can you take some more hallelujah so we are gonna change of the spirit man of the divine nature that change your nature out new heart new spirit in spirit that's the same thing we talking about new heart new spirit when his spirit steps in there that is not your nature anymore that's his nature and then you can't explain why you're forgiving people you're not about not making sense because it's not your nature you can't explain why your love you can explain why I forgive you can't explain why your worship because it no longer your nature it's his nature can the church say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord we're gonna skipper a few things when the message oneness that's got purpose that's God's purpose and his purpose as far the supreme wants to be one with his family directly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family over God was because God's nature was in them so Adam and Eve had God's nature in them that made them with God's nation and then with each other and God he became all one it's not a beautiful picture God in his family father over all supreme and it was because his nature was in them his nature no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache because Gorka get sick because his nature is unsinkable you know that that that's a word right his nature kind of get sick go car get sick can the church say man so where is nature begins to become more and more you suddenly sickness have to come by your street and not come nigh v-not this house not this house this nature I'm can the church amen hallelujah hallelujah no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable because that's his nature never to be sick never time I pick just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people God I want to see that to see the very nature of God in these people and we will see it we will see it walking the earth again will see it walking escheats once again will see it walk in the hospitals wander again we've seen walk in the streets of this country once again the very nature of God oh no temuco stoppage no demon can stop it why because the seed would in you is the very nature of God in Word form and one of these here's a spirit the rain the dynamics the Lateran will water that sheep bring it to life this service you gettin strung up every service you come with a realization of who you are every day something is growing in you one day Mary didn't know she was there but she was chosen to bring forth Christ can the church see man hallelujah blessed be the name of the local you take some more hallelujah in the identified Christ of all inches I'm feeling religious this evening I'm feeling excited because God chose me little ol me to put his nature God chose you to put his nature to confuse the devil to tie up the devil could put some cap shoes if you will and drop them around the world that would be compatible with his nature and God's love the seed in these capsules call us all and say let the devil as everybody the devil has churches the devil has ministers the devil has all kind of people but God has his horn people with the seed word in them that he sent a prophet to ensure that the ingredients the activated sheath would be presented to them the fertilizer the word the word that was scattered throughout all ages now reveals now connected now working together for the manifestation of the very nature of God in the identified Christ of all ages you see all these things just watch it Christ he was a part of it God doesn't change his nature doesn't change his nature doesn't change his nature doesn't change unchanging nature that's what the Prophet said if he healed in time for us he's got to do it again because he cannot improve on perfection he is perfect perfection he can't figure out a better way to do it and when he chose you before the foundation of the world that decision was a perfect decision Eden there was no better decision he can make because he cannot change he cannot change his mind about you he kind of change his thinking about you he cannot change his thoughts about you that's nature he said I am called I change not and as a nature of God the divine nature grows in you you become solid like a rock the Bible said to him not overcome it because you have to overcome yourself overcome everything to him that overcometh when you overcoming you making a room for him to grow you see but if I see that I empty out mg/l mg/l so he can fill fill fill to him that overcometh will I make as a pillar in the church you can't even move you you can't even shake you your rooted and grounded the winds that come the storms could blow but his divine nature only shakes and unzip peace be still the storm doesn't move you when you can speak to the strong come on now can the church say man this character doesn't change as the divine nature grows in you your doctrine Lochan you become more persuaded as Abraham grew and as time passed the back seat staggered not at the promise it became stronger it had to become stronger you know there's a law in economics diminishing returns that says as time progresses the effect of certain needs get weaker that's be so destructive it it happens in medicine as well they say after you take medicine puppies are okay after a period of time you take a stronger dose yeah because the effect of the medication starts away off so how much faith Abraham had when his body is getting weaker and Sirica than all it means that his feet was increasing because you need more feet than 113 at 75 come on now somebody preach back to me if God call you my parents all that years ago and you're still standing it means your feet had to be more than it was years ago come on now somebody reach back to me don't let the devil tell you you're weaker than you were years ago like the devil tell me you're tired I can't accept it it doesn't make sense out of the devil is lying to you it means where Terrance's he'll be taking this gospel we take him is a higher dose anybody see him those for the gorge all now the it way off but it could have to be increasingly those increasingly doors because you're still coming you're still coming you should've given up a long time ago but you still coming something is growing his divine nature is increasing in you that when your body want to give up did you still keep coming hallelujah but the terrace is here tonight you think his body not God water a cup but he take a pill and it's not one from the doctor is a real buildable this gospel and it gives him joy unspeakable that in the face of his trials you can count it all joy that the sufferings of this present time I'm not even worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us when the very divine nature of God is manifested in us and the church amen Oh hallelujah oh my who could stop it who could stop it my impossible impossible it's get better and better every day you get closer to the rapture you get stronger you get stronger you're getting stronger don't let the devil tell you getting weaker what is the ego do with a Guinea against the rock and she called the skills and it's like a new eagle again don't let the devil count you out don't let them come to us at all at all at all at all at all don't accept that they never go and check again wrong name wrong report wrong medical report who ain't check again and don't come back go you don't know how where to look because we're my record is and all my sins is in a sea of forgetfulness and way I'm going it's locked up in glory steel on our mystery that God hid from you I know you can find my file I cannot find my file look come and tell me you know who I am where I come from my cannot find it because my past is in the sheer forgetfulness and my destination is locked away in the seventh seal come on somebody bridge back to me Oh hallelujah glory to God but you did this you did this I don't know what you're talking about that might have been Jacob but my name is Israel my name is Israel man each inch of a new nature if you find Jacob telling me to fix them problems where I was I know me my name is Israel you might have problem it's all but my name is Paul don't come and bring soil problems to me now my name is Paul why you bringin who was Saul do and was sold to who is so light no solace my name is what I was in a road to Damascus one day and I was knocked off my horse what happened before that I never know but it's full of fire thickness change people I can't remember I could forget that he's an apostle he was speaking from experience [Applause] this divine nature's and commit a new name because God know your own name have trouble come on now Abram Abraham see right zero soil Paul come on now to him that overcometh will I grant a new name no man else is gonna know this is it between you and your God come on now somebody please back to me this thing is it's a nice tonight a little the divine nature of God it does something to you to give you all that is exceeded these are great promises change our body change your name change of attitude change of nature and and it's gonna come it's gonna come gradually because of the premise said as you near the headstone you become a super Church which means we are more Super Tuesday night and Sunday Friday night by Friday we are more of a super Church than tonight by Sunday we are more of a super Church because every day we are getting mirror that they have some near of the rapture near after duction nearer to perfection near a touch that still cannot see in that church hallelujah somebody gives a lot of shadow praise [Applause] hallelujah never get weary yet never get weary yet never get weary praising the Lord I never get weary it whoa you have to forgive me having my own service right now having my own time right now forgive me at home I apologize I apologize for being excited I apologize for being happy but I'm getting a deeper realization that this all me is gonna die and it's gonna be a new version of me version 2.0 then version 3.0 until you see version 7.0 when these seven flip shoes are gonna live on pulse and move walking up seven steps all the way to perfection because only divine love can make it over there only divine love can make it over there Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise the manifestation of the divine nature of God in the pride hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah let me drop this for you the prodigal son left his home without a full realization of the sea that was in his heart he didn't even understand the law of a seat so he went as far as he thought he could go that's why Jesus didn't bring the parable just to have it to us to have a parable to talk about it's a parable with a message that this prodigal son thought that he was on his own he thought that he was in control he thought that he was doing what he wanted to do and God was teaching us that no matter where he ended up and he ended up going against his beliefs because the three pigs to eat pig food meant he went against his spiritual belief because Jews and pigs don't fix so he was back slidden as bad season could be and in his back sitting condition the Bible says he came to his senses he came to it said it came to himself he came to himself which means with this he was here and himself with someone else but when he and himself meant by George you real who he was not the money not what he was boasting about not to what he was bragging about but he really him save oh wait a minute in my father's house these servants have food they have hamburger for those who eat hamburger they have vegan patties for those who have vegan they have swap meet they have they have they have no carbon they have a high-carb they have all kind of food and he I am eating pig food he said I will arise I will go to my father I will tell my father I have sinned am I even worried if you call your son and he is talking not even knowing his words can make sense because once your son you always a son so you see in I'm not worried to be called a son don't change the fact that your blood is son blood come on now don't change in fact that your DNA is royalty yeah you could change your name you can change your heart your outfit but whenever they see you didn't know your prince so he coming back and he listen I'm a servant not a son I'm a servant but a son he practicing this speech on the way home I mean moment if father see him coming he didn't see my servant is coming home he said kill the fatted calf because my son he might be back sitting but that's my son he might be in a condition but that's my son you can call him what you want what does my son and that's nuts amen and listen you know I love about God you see here is now where was yesterday way to last week what happened last month I want to pull my eyeball commentry of where was since he said listen kill the calf get your own candy ring steady music can I be ready my son who was once lost he is now fun can the church say Amen that's the divine nature of God this is the gospel of redemption it's a gospel of restoration is a gospel of bringing people back come the church see man oh I'm trying to wrap up here woo but Terry I'm feeling strong you know you never lie to me listen to me your tired your time a call my wife anywhere say I need some coffee come here this evening that I feel like you go for three hours today I go for trio is this hallelujah in revelation of Jesus Christ but about say let me show you another reason why season he it's this book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever this is powerful if you don't know the devil knows think about it the devil is sick today overall if we ever yeah be careful then people can just match us up the way they did it before he knows that she is a same yes native and he changes not he knows that and the Prophet senses a whole lot more than do 90% of the he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways the city knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God mark succeed in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else has Falls it has to be so as the divine nature of God because some manifest in his bride it will bring a true Church which is at sym mark 16 an action church where these signs follow them that believe in my name all of these things come to church amen but the Branham goes on him the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and debride I want to try to wrap up soon if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever ever saved the man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever failed a man with the Holy Ghost he's gotta to it and the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's gotta do it the second time and every other time on the same principles Oh hallelujah getting ready to wind down in modern events made clear by prophecy and so we finally a God does that in every age God does his own choosing by its own predestinated choosing he chooses profits and things for the ages fixes his nature the man's nature the man's style of preaching on the gift of knowledge this is meant to meet the challenge of that day God creates that man and sent him you see this thing this divine nature and how this hotel holding within each is connected God is orchestrating all of this because he's gonna have a super church and you want you to be in a position to speak to your family have an influence will be a children influence over your house influence over your life influence over those around you since the hacker I didn't even know that hot action and how was gonna have but when the Prophet was speaking about what took place and he said that's nothing but the truth all of a sudden he says whatever you need say it ask it say one the salvation of my two boys but bands if she wanted money to get money whatever she wanted and wherever those boys were salvation came just like Lazarus Lazarus didn't have a choice Lazarus come forth like the funny self on cam OTS all them these daily to figure it out and come out now see comedy jumping out jumping out dead man when that would speak when that voice weak dared if I go who if he had was that my separation ever happen happen I don't need an explanation I didn't know how it happened I just know where that voice speaks he said we don't need to know the mechanics I said I never went in for he speaks when I turn the car engine dick I have to start whatever needs to be connected needs to be connected but once the engine turn it need to start and when that voice speaks something must happen and there's coming a time where you speak because the Prophet said it when that time comes you say you speak what do you want we tell those seven thunders uttered I said that group could take Dolan and handed a slice and cut you open they have a they'll do what they want to do because his divine nature will be in them you love the Lord is evening can we give the Lord a hand the praise I'm finished Oh hallelujah hallelujah gives a lot of shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so as what Anthony gets ready by Thompson come so after this service there's more of his nature that's already in you every service you come as small every trial you face is more because it's preparing you to do more hallelujah and has nothing to with your feeling because even gettin all but everyday was getting closer to your son his age and his feeling had nothing to do with the fact that it was going to happen he couldn't look at his feeling can look at his emotion but I feel nothing and they have nothing to do with that hallelujah button of light is growing and because of that the devil now has you have more of a target and that's a good thing that's a great thing if you're not a target for the enemy you're not only run him up but if you're a target for the enemy to me that there's a light in you I never say who is that who what's going on their level can the church say man
