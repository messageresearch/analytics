[12:17] once again
[12:19] to have a conversation lord around your
[12:21] word in this
[12:22] lord this bible study i pray dear god
[12:24] that you would touch
[12:25] your church touch your people lord may
[12:28] you touch our lives may you speak to us
[12:31] from your scriptures tonight
[12:33] lord may you take me out of the way
[12:35] completely and may you speak lifty ear
[12:37] to your
[12:38] lord needy sons and daughters lord we
[12:40] are here tonight
[12:41] lord because we all have needs lord we
[12:44] are not here
[12:45] just to be present and to be part of a
[12:48] roll call as it were
[12:50] but lord when you were here you said
[12:53] they are well
[12:54] have no need of her physician and you
[12:56] made it clear that you came to deal with
[12:59] situations you came
[13:00] to deal with challenges you came to deal
[13:03] with people who realized that
[13:05] they were not whole father so lord when
[13:08] you would ask the question will thou
[13:10] be made whole you were giving an
[13:12] opportunity to help close the gap to
[13:15] be where someone didn't even realize
[13:17] they could be
[13:18] because man didn't realize that he could
[13:20] even be complete he could even be whole
[13:22] he could even be perfect so lord may you
[13:24] speak to us through your word
[13:26] through your scriptures tonight lord for
[13:28] the next few moments
[13:30] lord that we don't take it for granted
[13:32] we law realize that
[13:34] time is just fading away lord and
[13:37] lord we want to be ready we want to be
[13:41] lord mature sons and daughters father
[13:43] that could
[13:44] apply this word lord in in in in a
[13:47] practical way father lord
[13:49] understanding that this whole message of
[13:51] the hour is to produce a life
[13:53] producer demonstration lord of lord
[13:57] how you were when you were on this earth
[13:59] lord through the different ages through
[14:01] the different
[14:02] prophets the different kings the
[14:04] different messengers the different
[14:06] leaders you had through scripture how we
[14:08] take encouragement and
[14:09] inspiration from them and we can look
[14:12] at it and realize that we could do
[14:14] better lord and we want to understand
[14:16] how
[14:17] we could do better we want to understand
[14:19] how we can grow we want to understand
[14:21] how
[14:21] father lord we can look into your word
[14:24] that you left us
[14:25] your mind to us that we could go in at
[14:27] any time to catch a glimpse of your
[14:30] thinking on certain matters certain
[14:31] issues so
[14:32] lord as the word goes forth may you
[14:35] minister to your sons minister to your
[14:37] daughters minister to
[14:39] marriages minister to the young people
[14:41] minister to the caleb's may you give
[14:43] hope and comfort
[14:44] lord to those that need hope and comfort
[14:46] and if there's anyone who is
[14:48] in that valley of decision or at that
[14:50] crossroads where they're not sure where
[14:52] to go and how to do and how to move and
[14:54] how to live and how to act lord may you
[14:56] speak to them through your word
[14:58] lord that they would find themselves in
[15:00] you and understand that you are the
[15:02] author and the finisher so father
[15:04] we commit the service into your hands we
[15:05] commit the time into your hands
[15:07] in the precious name of jesus christ
[15:09] amen and amen and amen certainly want to
[15:12] greet
[15:13] uh one and all tonight in the precious
[15:14] team of jesus christ it's certainly a
[15:16] great privilege
[15:17] to be able to gather another time
[15:20] around the sacred word of god
[15:24] that we have grown to understand is our
[15:26] source
[15:27] is our strength is our refuge is our
[15:29] comfort
[15:30] and it's a break uh in in in
[15:34] uh what has become our routine you know
[15:36] having to go to work having to
[15:38] do school and now work and school blends
[15:42] in this blended learning situations and
[15:44] all of these
[15:45] new experiences that 2020 has presented
[15:49] that with it has brought its own
[15:50] challenges and its own
[15:52] tests and its own frustrations and its
[15:55] own concerns
[15:56] and and we have not been this way before
[15:59] it's both in the natural and it's also
[16:01] in the spiritual
[16:03] but we are comforted by the fact that
[16:05] every situation we ever have to
[16:07] uh encounter we could find strength in
[16:09] scripture
[16:10] we could find somewhere where god could
[16:13] allow us to
[16:14] to get encouragement so uh last week uh
[16:18] we were speaking uh on on
[16:21] solomon and the book of proverbs and for
[16:23] those who have been following
[16:25] we would have addressed and introduced
[16:27] solomon
[16:28] a few weeks back and and last week we
[16:30] continue it and into exploring the book
[16:32] of proverbs
[16:33] and i've said it a few times that many
[16:36] times
[16:36] we have part ones and we never get to
[16:38] part twos and these things because
[16:40] we we know we need to get there but we
[16:42] also depend on on leadership to move
[16:44] forward
[16:45] um but tonight i wanted to continue in
[16:48] proverbs
[16:49] uh there's so much in there that could
[16:52] help us
[16:53] and uh it it it is it's it's a lot
[16:56] uh when you kind of take your time and
[16:58] go through it but
[16:59] uh for the sake of of a title
[17:02] of tonight it'll be exploring the book
[17:04] of proverbs
[17:06] part two and i trust will be an
[17:08] encouragement to you we would have
[17:10] introduced uh last week a context for
[17:13] the book of proverbs and for those who
[17:14] may be joining us
[17:16] on this journey tonight uh for the first
[17:18] time um
[17:19] in the book of proverbs i do want to
[17:22] refresh us
[17:23] by just reading that uh snippet uh
[17:26] from what introduces the book of
[17:29] proverbs in my
[17:30] king james bible and reference our
[17:32] characters before we continue
[17:34] by the grace of god tonight so
[17:38] just to lay a foundation the key word in
[17:40] proverbs is wisdom
[17:42] the ability to live life skillfully and
[17:45] those are powerful words
[17:46] live life skillfully a godly life in an
[17:50] ungodly world
[17:52] and if there ever was a time wherein an
[17:54] ungodly world
[17:55] is now however is uh a godly life in an
[17:59] ungodly world however is no
[18:00] simple assignment proverbs provides
[18:03] god's detailed instructions
[18:05] for his people to deal successfully
[18:09] with the practical affairs of everyday
[18:12] life
[18:13] how to relate to god parents
[18:16] children neighbors and government
[18:19] solomon the principal author uses a
[18:22] combination of poetry
[18:24] parables pathy questions short stories
[18:27] and wise maxims to give in strikingly
[18:31] memorable form the common sense and
[18:34] divine perspective
[18:36] necessary to handle life's issues
[18:39] and life is full of issues every day
[18:42] it's a it's a different issue we have to
[18:45] deal with and sometimes it feels as if
[18:47] all we're dealing with is issues so it's
[18:49] important for us to have a compass a
[18:50] north star
[18:51] a place where we can look to and get
[18:53] guidance uh
[18:55] into how to move and how to live we
[18:56] would have also introduced last week the
[18:58] tapestry
[18:59] that indicated that going true proverbs
[19:02] although
[19:03] it sometimes could feel somewhat
[19:05] disconnected and it's a quote here and a
[19:06] phrase here
[19:07] when you really go above the book you
[19:10] see ultimately only three
[19:12] individuals broadly being described we
[19:14] spoke about the wise
[19:16] we spoke about the fool and we spoke
[19:19] about the simple
[19:20] and just to refresh our memories
[19:23] in defining this we learn that
[19:26] the wise are defined as the wise
[19:30] characters show skill
[19:31] in the art of godly living this is the
[19:34] person who
[19:35] continues to work hard at applying the
[19:38] grace of god
[19:39] the story of the gospel to everyday
[19:42] situations
[19:43] he is not perfect at it but over months
[19:45] and years he sees more and more
[19:47] how the promises of god apply to every
[19:50] square inch of his life and we
[19:51] understand as we go through this and we
[19:54] have the
[19:55] the the opportunity to look at scripture
[19:58] through the fought light
[19:59] of the messenger malachi 4 to understand
[20:02] that we are predestinated to adoption
[20:04] and we do have
[20:05] a promise of perfection so we understand
[20:07] where this is
[20:08] and by contrast the fool is the person
[20:11] steadily opposed to god's covenant
[20:13] he's the one who rejects the forgiveness
[20:16] offered by god who can be
[20:18] dangerous in his influence and who
[20:20] grieves his parents
[20:21] and we'll see it pronounced all through
[20:24] the book of proverbs as well and
[20:25] our last main character you will find in
[20:27] proverbs is the simple
[20:30] the character described as a simple in
[20:32] the book of proverbs is the one
[20:34] not firmly committed to wisdom or
[20:36] foolishness
[20:37] or anything for that matter he is easily
[20:40] misled
[20:42] he easily falls into believing the
[20:44] majority opinion of the crowd
[20:46] he can be religious when surrounded by
[20:48] religious people
[20:49] he can be sinful when surrounded by
[20:51] sinners he can be lazy
[20:53] when surrounded by slackers etc he is
[20:56] not
[20:56] actively opposed to god but he doesn't
[20:58] really care that much
[21:00] either the simple is not as far gone as
[21:02] the fool
[21:03] but he tends to be the guy who when in
[21:06] the presence of
[21:07] wise teaching remains unaffected it
[21:10] whistles through his head so
[21:11] this is a bit of a reflection of what we
[21:13] said last week
[21:14] as we begin to build on where we were at
[21:16] and if you recall we would have ended
[21:18] last week on
[21:20] uh proverbs 3 around verse 26
[21:23] um quite honestly it will be a
[21:26] monumental task to read every
[21:28] verse of proverbs and by no means uh is
[21:31] that
[21:31] uh my objective so i want to kind of
[21:33] highlight some
[21:34] some aspects of it but you would recall
[21:37] we closed out last week
[21:38] rejoicing about when thou liest down
[21:41] thou shalt not be afraid yea
[21:43] thou shall lie down and thy sleep shall
[21:45] be sweet that was proverbs
[21:47] 3 24 and we went on to be not afraid of
[21:51] sudden fear
[21:52] neither of the desolation of the wicked
[21:54] when it cometh for the lord shall be thy
[21:56] confidence we spoke about the lord
[21:58] being like confidence proverbs 3 uh this
[22:01] is verse 26 the lord shall be thy
[22:03] confidence
[22:04] and shall keep thy foot from being taken
[22:07] so
[22:08] the desolate foundation for us tonight i
[22:11] don't want to be too long but just to
[22:13] encourage you i want to continue
[22:15] in three then we're going to touch four
[22:17] then we're going to jump a little bit to
[22:18] 10
[22:19] and if time permits a little bit of 15
[22:21] and 16
[22:22] i'm going to try to see uh how we could
[22:24] bring some some closure there
[22:26] all right are you with me tonight i
[22:28] trust that you're having a
[22:30] a wonderful time in the lord and that
[22:32] you are enjoying
[22:33] your trials and enjoying your testings
[22:37] and enjoying your chastisements and
[22:40] enjoying the reproof
[22:41] because if you are enjoying these things
[22:45] that cons that counts you as wise
[22:48] that's one of the the benchmarks of wise
[22:50] because when you read about the fool
[22:51] before
[22:52] go like reproof the fool doesn't like
[22:54] correction
[22:55] you know so so let's start with verse 27
[22:58] tonight
[22:59] and we'll see how uh god could work with
[23:01] us tonight
[23:02] so verse 27 says withhold not good
[23:05] from them to whom it is due
[23:09] when it is in the power of thine hand to
[23:11] do it
[23:12] so withholding good here is not just
[23:14] this is not just physical
[23:16] withholding as in a physical thing but
[23:18] sometimes you can give a word of
[23:20] encouragement to somebody it's in your
[23:21] power to do it and you just
[23:22] and you just don't want to tell somebody
[23:24] yeah you have people who
[23:26] don't like to to give you know so
[23:29] this is with whole not good from them to
[23:31] whom it is due
[23:32] so they they are entitled to do it it's
[23:35] in the amplified it says you rightful
[23:36] recipients
[23:38] you know there are some people who you
[23:39] meet them they don't have much good to
[23:41] see
[23:41] you know their people we sometimes call
[23:43] them negative focus
[23:44] you know they only will critique they
[23:46] will only say negative but
[23:47] but if there's something good to say
[23:49] you'll never hear any good you never
[23:50] hear the positive so the bible is saying
[23:52] here
[23:52] if you have the power the ability to to
[23:55] give good it's in thy power to do so
[23:58] don't hold it back there's nothing wrong
[23:59] with blessing somebody encouraging
[24:01] somebody
[24:02] there's nothing wrong with giving a
[24:03] compliment there are people who
[24:05] are so caught up in themselves somebody
[24:06] make a nice cake somebody cook a nice
[24:08] pot of food and because they didn't cook
[24:10] it they want to say something good about
[24:11] it
[24:12] you know it's in that power to give a
[24:13] compliment it's in your power to give
[24:15] all right
[24:16] verse 28 say not unto thy neighbor go
[24:19] and come again and tomorrow i will give
[24:22] wendell hasted by thee so in other words
[24:24] somebody come and say um brother so and
[24:26] so i need you know somebody said you say
[24:27] well listen
[24:28] come back to mourinho and you know right
[24:30] next to you and you draw you have what
[24:32] he puts in need
[24:33] but you're there are you saying you're
[24:34] not ramming yourself are they trying to
[24:37] to come across a certain way so look at
[24:39] the simplicity but look at the fact that
[24:41] it is written in scripture
[24:42] to give you conduct to give you behavior
[24:46] and recognize that this whole message is
[24:48] about the life
[24:49] that's what we stress in that and we
[24:51] find the pattern of the life
[24:52] not just in the prophets quotes but when
[24:54] you go to scripture you see the kind of
[24:56] life
[24:57] that god is trying to reflect and we are
[25:00] quoting here from proverbs
[25:01] because we understand outside of the
[25:03] ministry of jesus christ solomon was the
[25:05] wisest man who ever walked the earth
[25:07] all right so we're looking to get
[25:08] context here right
[25:10] so devise not evil against thy neighbor
[25:13] seeing he dwell it securely by thee all
[25:15] right so
[25:16] again this is not being addressed now
[25:20] as in to fool or wise in this context
[25:22] this is just
[25:23] instructions these are instructions
[25:25] devise not evil
[25:27] against thy neighbor seeing he dwelled
[25:29] securely
[25:30] by thee all right strive not with a man
[25:33] without cause
[25:34] if he had done thee no harm all right in
[25:37] the amplified do not quarrel with a man
[25:38] without cause if he has done you no harm
[25:41] you see people who like to pick other
[25:42] people fight
[25:44] this is the scripture for your idea
[25:46] you're getting into a quarrel
[25:48] for a man without cause especially when
[25:51] the person has done you nothing so you
[25:52] have
[25:53] just think of it within the church
[25:54] context it's not just the message alone
[25:56] it's it's everywhere people picking a
[25:58] fight because of somebody else's
[25:59] situation
[26:00] and suddenly they have words with you
[26:02] you never meet them before but they know
[26:04] 29 reasons why they shouldn't be talking
[26:06] to you all right
[26:07] this here is it is it strive not with a
[26:10] mammoth of course if you have done thee
[26:11] no harm
[26:12] he ever hurt you no why is your problem
[26:14] with him well he talked to my pastor so
[26:16] i vex with him
[26:16] all right so this is it envy thou not
[26:19] the oppressor and
[26:20] choose none of his ways all right and
[26:23] specifically this oppressor
[26:25] is deemed a man of violence in the
[26:28] amplified so
[26:29] do not envy a man of violence so this is
[26:31] the young
[26:32] brothers in particular who want to try
[26:35] to be
[26:35] you know you want to be a gangster
[26:37] you're looking at the are the people on
[26:38] the street and saying i want to be i
[26:40] wish
[26:41] and and that is your role model so he
[26:43] said
[26:44] envy not the oppressor don't try to
[26:47] envy the man of violence and choose not
[26:50] any of his ways for the fraud
[26:54] or a devious uh is an abomination to the
[26:57] lord
[26:58] but his secret is with the righteous the
[27:01] curse of the lord is in the house of the
[27:02] wicked
[27:03] but he blessed the habitation or the
[27:06] dwelling
[27:07] place of the just surely he scorned
[27:10] the scorners but he gave it grace unto
[27:12] the lowly
[27:13] the wise shall inherit glory but shame
[27:17] shall be the promotion of the fools so
[27:19] fools have promotion come in
[27:22] but the promotion that fools get is
[27:23] actually shame
[27:25] when they process that so the fools have
[27:27] their promotion
[27:28] but the promotion they get is actually
[27:30] shame all right
[27:31] so let's move into into into chapter
[27:33] four hear you children the
[27:36] instruction of a father and attend
[27:39] in other words pay attention that's what
[27:42] a ten means
[27:44] to no understanding all right so i want
[27:47] to read
[27:48] that in the amplified so you understand
[27:50] the depth of this initial statement hear
[27:52] all children the instruction of a father
[27:55] and pay attention
[27:56] and it says and be willing to learn so
[27:58] that you may gain
[28:00] understanding and intelligent
[28:02] discernment
[28:03] one of the challenges we have not just
[28:06] in the spiritual but in a natural and as
[28:07] in natural within your spiritual
[28:09] is people don't want to take their time
[28:10] to learn all right
[28:12] mastery takes time being skilled
[28:16] takes time so i was sharing and i've
[28:18] shared it before i may have shared it
[28:20] in in this room before and i shared
[28:21] certainly uh in business conversations
[28:24] that
[28:24] a lot of people look to professions such
[28:27] as
[28:27] i want to be a doctor i want to be a
[28:30] pilot i want to be
[28:31] and these are the kind of things and i
[28:33] say you know what if you really study
[28:35] how a pilot
[28:36] uh operates no matter how bright you are
[28:39] as a pilot
[28:40] you cannot leave the airport without
[28:43] checking off certain things on the
[28:45] checklist you can't say well i know in
[28:46] my memory
[28:47] all right so as good as you are as a
[28:50] pilot
[28:51] the the the authority of the airport
[28:53] will not let me say
[28:54] you know well he's a bright pilot so let
[28:56] me just take off
[28:58] there has to be because of the risk
[29:01] involved
[29:02] they kind of depend purely on his memory
[29:05] purely on his intelligence so
[29:08] there are measures in place to ensure
[29:10] that there's a disciplined approach
[29:12] to operating and this is what many of us
[29:15] lack in our daily lives we lack it in
[29:17] our
[29:17] business lives we lack it in our
[29:19] spiritual lives a disciplined approach
[29:21] to life and we're going to see
[29:22] more of it as we go into proverbs about
[29:25] a disciplined life there right
[29:27] verse two this is chapter four verse two
[29:29] before i give you
[29:30] good doctrine for seeking not my law
[29:34] so this proverbs four is one of the only
[29:37] times in the book of proverbs
[29:39] where you already see solomon is almost
[29:41] speaking about his particular situation
[29:43] all right so verse 3 said for i was my
[29:46] father's son
[29:47] tender and only beloved in the sight of
[29:50] my mother
[29:51] all right so he's speaking about his
[29:52] relationship with his father david
[29:54] and his mother bathsheba all right he
[29:57] taught me also
[29:58] and said unto me let thine heart retain
[30:01] my words
[30:02] keep my commandments and live all right
[30:07] get wisdom get understanding forget it
[30:10] not we spoke about this last week so
[30:12] you will see this theme repeated true
[30:15] proverbs
[30:16] the fact that has been repeated means to
[30:18] give more
[30:19] credibility more uh a commitment to it
[30:22] more dedication get wisdom all right so
[30:25] from last week to this week
[30:27] what activities have you done to to get
[30:29] wisdom
[30:30] all right so we get into to to dig get
[30:33] wisdom
[30:33] get understanding so it means that
[30:35] wisdom can be acquired it means
[30:37] understanding can be acquired you cannot
[30:40] sit down
[30:41] and do nothing about it when it's a
[30:42] command to get it
[30:44] all right so every week your wisdom
[30:46] should be increasing
[30:47] every week your understanding should be
[30:49] increasing and as your wisdom increases
[30:52] and as your understanding increases your
[30:54] conversation should be changing
[30:55] the way your lives should be changing
[30:57] the way your act should be changing the
[30:58] way you conduct your affairs in your
[31:00] home
[31:00] in your marriage in your business in
[31:02] your situation should reflect
[31:04] a growth of your understanding a growth
[31:06] of your wisdom
[31:08] get wisdom get understanding this is
[31:11] we're in verse five
[31:12] forget it not all right so make it is so
[31:15] important to you that you forget it not
[31:17] neither decline from the words of my
[31:20] mouth
[31:20] all right so do not decline from the
[31:23] words of my mouth
[31:24] right six forsake or not
[31:28] and she shall preserve me love her
[31:31] and she shall keep be he's talking about
[31:33] wisdom here
[31:34] so don't forsake wisdom do not turn away
[31:38] from her
[31:38] and she will guard and protect you love
[31:40] her and she will watch over you
[31:42] verse 7 wisdom is the principal thing
[31:46] therefore get wisdom i mean all thy
[31:48] getting
[31:49] get understanding exalt her
[31:52] and she shall promote thee she shall
[31:55] bring thee to honor
[31:56] when thou dost embrace her this is
[31:59] powerful stuff i want you to see the
[32:01] power
[32:01] of wisdom the importance of getting
[32:03] understanding all right
[32:08] verse 9 she shall give to thine head an
[32:10] ornament of grace
[32:14] a crown of glory shall she deliver to me
[32:16] so this is not your boss doing it
[32:18] this is not your family doing it this is
[32:20] not the ministry doing it
[32:22] this is when you pay attention to wisdom
[32:24] and we spoke last week
[32:25] how solomon was personifying wisdom
[32:29] making wisdom a person trying to catch
[32:30] your attention making
[32:32] it a person that that that want to be
[32:34] present in your life
[32:36] making it so clear to you of how
[32:38] important this thing about
[32:40] skillful living and we're not talking
[32:42] about your
[32:43] version of wisdom or the university
[32:45] version of wisdom
[32:46] or the church understanding of wisdom
[32:48] we're talking about godly wisdom
[32:50] the way god thinks everybody with me all
[32:52] right
[32:53] so verse 10 hear o my son and receive
[32:56] my sayings and the years of thy life
[32:59] shall be many
[33:01] so this is powerful here we have another
[33:03] life extension
[33:05] here we have another scripture that's
[33:07] tied god is finding ways to tie to your
[33:10] life being extended i heard somebody say
[33:12] recently what's the good
[33:14] to try to to to extend life and not have
[33:16] a good quality of life
[33:18] all right and that is what man tries to
[33:20] do using yes
[33:21] just health you know you're you're
[33:23] trying to live life a certain way but
[33:25] without god no matter what
[33:26] you have to extend life with the right
[33:28] quality of life and the right quality of
[33:30] life comes from being spirit-filled
[33:32] comes from living the way god wants all
[33:34] right
[33:36] so here oh my son and receive my sayings
[33:39] and the years of thy life shall be many
[33:42] so if you hear
[33:43] and receive my sins and the life and the
[33:46] years of your life
[33:46] shall be many all right let's go i have
[33:50] thought thee
[33:50] in the way of wisdom so wisdom can be
[33:52] taught so coming to now because listen
[33:55] if you don't understand
[33:56] and i've said it before you don't know
[33:58] what you don't know so the more you get
[34:00] exposed to hey i recognized i didn't
[34:02] realize i could get wisdom
[34:04] i didn't realize that wisdom could be
[34:05] taught i didn't realize that there was a
[34:07] better way
[34:08] now that these things are identified it
[34:10] now makes you
[34:11] approach it a certain way because you
[34:12] want to get it anybody with me all right
[34:15] i have taught thee in the way of wisdom
[34:17] i have led thee
[34:18] in the right paths that's verse 11 verse
[34:20] 12
[34:21] when thou goest thy steps shall not be
[34:23] straightened
[34:24] all right so this straightened here is
[34:27] impeded
[34:27] or slowed down right and when the run is
[34:30] thou shalt not stumble take fast hold of
[34:33] instruction
[34:34] and let her not go keep her for she is
[34:38] thy life all right everybody fine
[34:41] everybody doing good
[34:43] okay let's go on now verse 14.
[34:47] now this here i really want to focus on
[34:50] this one
[34:50] with the young people but it applies to
[34:52] everybody all right enter not in the
[34:54] path
[34:55] of the wicked so i want you to see the
[34:58] path of the wicked is like a road of the
[35:01] wicked
[35:01] so enter nothing to the path of the
[35:03] wicked and
[35:05] go not in the way of evil men all right
[35:08] or the behavior of evil men and then it
[35:10] goes deeper
[35:11] all right and you'll see scriptures and
[35:13] message but about avoiding shady places
[35:16] and
[35:16] and shady situations but verse 15 says
[35:19] avoid it so avoid it
[35:23] pass not buy it turn
[35:26] from it and pass away
[35:30] let me say that one more time avoid it
[35:33] pass not buy it turn from it
[35:36] and pass away so
[35:39] this here removes every kind of excuse
[35:43] that you could possibly have because the
[35:45] scripture is saying
[35:46] don't go buy it and if for some reason
[35:50] yeah and then
[35:50] it passed not by it if your friend was
[35:53] in the car and it was in the car
[35:55] okay you turned from it and passed away
[35:58] all right these are scriptures as a
[36:00] young man and whatever will
[36:02] tell you as a young christian proverb is
[36:04] like the the marching orders
[36:06] this is what protects you all right
[36:09] enter not in the path of the wicked
[36:11] go not in the way of evil men avoid it
[36:14] pass
[36:14] not by it turn from it and pass away
[36:17] and verse 16 and i shared this with the
[36:20] young people before
[36:21] for they sleep not these evil people
[36:24] except they have done mischief
[36:26] you know they are people they can't
[36:27] sleep until they cause trouble
[36:32] you you you process that for a minute
[36:34] the bible is saying you know
[36:36] for they sleep not they can't fall
[36:38] asleep
[36:39] except they have done mischief and their
[36:42] sleep is taken away
[36:44] unless they cause some to fall so
[36:47] they're tossing and turning
[36:49] because their spirit is is driving them
[36:52] to do evil and that we have people
[36:54] in the world like that you can't be
[36:55] ignorant of the environment we're living
[36:57] in
[36:57] all right
[37:01] verse 17 for they eat the bread of
[37:04] wickedness and drink the wine of
[37:06] violence but the path of the just
[37:09] is as the shining light that shine it
[37:12] more and more
[37:13] onto the perfect day so the part that we
[37:15] are walking on
[37:16] is as a shining light that shining more
[37:19] and more onto the perfectly
[37:21] hallelujah aren't you looking for that
[37:23] perfect day hallelujah i'll be walking
[37:25] in the light
[37:26] you see the parallels there all right
[37:28] the way of the wicked is as darkness
[37:30] this is the opposite now they know not
[37:33] at what they stumble
[37:34] so you see somebody lost their way they
[37:36] don't know where they're going they
[37:37] don't know how to
[37:37] that is the result of it so verse 20 my
[37:40] son attend to my words
[37:42] incline thine air unto my sayings 21
[37:45] let them not depart from thine eyes keep
[37:48] them in the midst of thine heart
[37:50] for their life unto those that find them
[37:52] and health
[37:53] to all their flesh so your health is
[37:56] tied to this thing too you know
[37:58] i want you to catch that tonight your
[38:01] health
[38:02] healing of your body healing of your
[38:04] mind healing of your soul
[38:06] is tied to this thing here oh somebody
[38:08] say amen
[38:09] so verse 23 keep thy heart
[38:13] with all diligence i've preached this
[38:16] before
[38:17] guard your heart but always spoken this
[38:18] as well with all diligence
[38:20] with all your effort with all putting in
[38:23] measured in place for out of it
[38:25] are the issues of life the issues of
[38:28] your life come from what's in your heart
[38:31] the successes you have come from what in
[38:34] your heart
[38:35] the challenges you have come from what
[38:36] in your heart you have to understand the
[38:39] impact
[38:40] of the inputs in your life to the
[38:43] outputs of your life let me say that one
[38:44] more time
[38:46] you have to understand the input of your
[38:48] life
[38:49] and how it's connected to the outputs of
[38:51] your life because the bible is saying
[38:53] out of your heart the issues so if the
[38:56] issues is anger
[38:57] and the issue is jealousy and the issue
[39:00] is envy
[39:01] and the issue is is is you don't want to
[39:03] talk to people
[39:04] and the issue is you don't want to come
[39:05] to church and the issue is
[39:07] is you don't want nobody to tell you
[39:08] what to do and the issue is you don't
[39:10] want to save and the issue whatever the
[39:12] issue is it's coming from your heart
[39:16] and if you don't guard your heart if you
[39:19] don't control the inputs
[39:21] those who study computer no garbage in
[39:23] garbage out
[39:24] so if you feed your heart foolishness
[39:26] it'll produce in itself
[39:29] if on your workplace you there living in
[39:32] an environment
[39:32] you're on your job you're in the
[39:34] lunchroom and people having
[39:35] conversations
[39:37] that are negative negative to something
[39:39] that affects your christian walk and you
[39:41] keep
[39:42] feeding on that yeah god in your heart
[39:43] your heart open
[39:45] whatever they talk about you processing
[39:47] it you have to know what conversations
[39:49] to walk away from
[39:51] you have to know when it's not your time
[39:53] to be in the lunchroom
[39:54] you have to know when to have your
[39:56] headphones on so that you don't listen
[39:57] to what other people
[39:58] seeing around you because you want to
[40:00] guard your heart
[40:02] because it is not dear issues you're
[40:04] concerned about it's your issues
[40:07] i want to say that one more time it is
[40:09] not dear issues you're considerable so
[40:11] no it's
[40:11] it's the issues of life your life
[40:14] because you want to have a good quality
[40:16] of life
[40:18] so we say out of the abundance of the
[40:20] heart you don't speak
[40:22] so when you compliment somebody you're
[40:24] casting something good it means your
[40:25] heart is where the problem isn't
[40:28] and and and i can't take responsibility
[40:31] for god in your heart
[40:32] but the overconnecting responsible
[40:33] guardian in your heart
[40:35] you there on in city gate you there in a
[40:38] maxi
[40:39] you there driving on the road you there
[40:41] listening to music
[40:43] feeding your spirit with with music that
[40:45] have you all over the place
[40:48] who's supposed to comment somebody's
[40:49] supposed to come in you can't you think
[40:50] gorgeous going to enjoy the change
[40:52] the radio chaser new yorker
[40:55] that if you want to put god on that duty
[40:59] so the challenge here is you and god or
[41:03] or keep or protect your heart
[41:06] with all diligence all diligence means
[41:09] all effort i want to stress that point
[41:14] for from it comes all the issues of life
[41:16] put away from the
[41:18] a forward mouth lying misleading mouth
[41:23] most of the problems we end up in and we
[41:26] will see it in scripture shortly is
[41:27] what we say you know
[41:30] we say the wrong things and we see the
[41:33] parallel
[41:34] where sister had you right but i'm
[41:36] talking about she said the right thing
[41:38] and the way god can say you say the
[41:40] right thing is the same way you could
[41:42] say the wrong thing
[41:43] you can say the wrong thing on your job
[41:45] and get a different response you said
[41:46] your wrong thing to your wife your
[41:48] husband your child
[41:49] a completely different response so put
[41:52] away from the afraid mouth
[41:54] and perverse lips put far from thee
[42:00] let thine eyes look right on
[42:03] right on means directly ahead and nine
[42:06] eyelid look straight
[42:07] before me
[42:11] hallelujah in other words god is saying
[42:13] don't get distracted
[42:15] all right and i pray that these bible
[42:17] studies and these opportunities get
[42:18] together
[42:19] it's about focus so here you have a
[42:21] director let the
[42:23] eyes look right on and that right on
[42:25] means directly ahead
[42:27] in the amplified it says toward the part
[42:29] of moral courage
[42:32] that's powerful moral courage it takes
[42:34] something to push you on
[42:36] moral courage and let the eyelid look
[42:38] straight
[42:39] before thee let your fear your gears be
[42:42] fixed straight in front of you in the
[42:43] amplified
[42:44] towards the path of integrity this is
[42:46] the challenge to us all i don't know if
[42:48] this is helping anybody tonight
[42:50] maybe you read this before maybe it's
[42:51] the first time maybe you you're tired of
[42:53] hearing this
[42:54] but at the risk of being repetitive i'm
[42:56] nailing it down again tonight right
[42:58] ponder the path of thy feet and let all
[43:01] thy ways
[43:02] be established i want to nail that down
[43:04] again consider well
[43:07] and watch carefully the part of your
[43:09] feet
[43:11] so as a christian you're not just
[43:13] jumping into anything
[43:16] anybody with me as a christian you are
[43:19] pondering the part of thy feet
[43:21] you are thinking before you act you are
[43:24] in the ambulance say consider well and
[43:27] watch
[43:28] carefully the path of your feet
[43:31] i want you to reflect in your life when
[43:33] you made a hasty decision
[43:36] when you didn't consider well and you
[43:38] didn't watch
[43:39] carefully the part of your feet what was
[43:41] the result of it
[43:43] and when you think back because most of
[43:45] us we don't like to do
[43:46] introspection and reflection and
[43:49] self-analysis
[43:50] let's see wait a minute you know i
[43:51] really messed up there why did i mess up
[43:53] you know what i moved too fast i didn't
[43:55] pray
[43:55] i didn't seek wisdom i didn't get any
[43:57] knowledge i didn't have understanding of
[43:58] the situation and look at the outcome of
[44:00] it
[44:01] so verse 26 ponder the path of thy feet
[44:05] and let all thy ways be established
[44:09] turn not to the right hand nor to the
[44:11] left remove thy foot
[44:13] from evil right so
[44:17] we're making some progress now let's
[44:18] jump to 10
[44:20] proverbs 10. we're doing we're doing
[44:23] good with time so far
[44:26] proverbs 10 verse 1
[44:32] warmer places the proverbs of solomon
[44:36] a wise son make it a glad father
[44:41] so young people well it's not just young
[44:43] people because
[44:44] you could be you know a little older as
[44:47] well but
[44:50] you want a glad father
[44:54] becoming wise is the key to a glad
[44:56] father
[44:57] but a foolish son is the heaviness of
[45:00] his mother
[45:03] in the amplified it says a foolish and
[45:06] it says stubborn
[45:07] so it ties the foolishness here to being
[45:09] stubborn
[45:10] who refuses to learn is a grief to his
[45:13] mother
[45:16] i remember in school the teacher
[45:20] said two want to learn this one there's
[45:23] one stubborn
[45:24] this one this one easy to teach and a
[45:27] teacher you speak with a school teacher
[45:29] and and one of the greatest frustrations
[45:31] of a teacher
[45:34] you don't have different kinds of
[45:35] teachers you know
[45:37] and uh i want to shout out brother
[45:38] stephen and and there are many
[45:40] teachers but i i talked about this even
[45:42] because but seems only a few teachers i
[45:43] know
[45:44] who has really missed school when it's
[45:46] holiday time
[45:47] you know it's one of the most passionate
[45:49] teachers
[45:50] i mean it's a paradox to me because you
[45:53] have teachers who love teaching
[45:54] and they have teachers who just you know
[45:57] is a whole job now
[45:58] you know but no matter the skill of the
[46:01] teacher whether they love teaching or is
[46:03] a job to them
[46:04] there's nothing more rewarding or
[46:05] exciting even to the worst teacher
[46:08] when a student who has the ability to
[46:10] perform performs
[46:12] that has its reward you don't have to be
[46:14] passionate about teaching but it's
[46:16] something else
[46:17] because you feel a level of validation
[46:19] when you put the effort into a lesson
[46:20] plan
[46:21] and you have a syllabus and a curriculum
[46:23] and you have goals and you see somebody
[46:24] there
[46:24] catching the revelation of it or the
[46:26] inspiration of it or the idea of it
[46:29] but it's nothing more frustrating than
[46:32] when somebody has the potential they
[46:34] have the ability
[46:35] and they refuse to learn
[46:40] and as it is in that situation in your
[46:42] school so you have it in the natural
[46:44] you have it in in marriages you have it
[46:47] in homes everything you choose people
[46:48] refuse to learn
[46:50] so this scripture here but a foolish
[46:53] stubborn son who refuses to learn is a
[46:55] greek day's mother
[46:56] all right so everyone in nearly only
[46:58] context right
[46:59] treasures of wickedness profit nothing
[47:03] and you've seen it time and time again
[47:04] people going after where they're going
[47:06] after treasure
[47:08] but it is of wickedness ill-gotten gains
[47:12] profit nothing but righteousness deliver
[47:14] it from death
[47:16] this the lord will not suffer the soul
[47:19] of the righteous the famish
[47:23] powerful but he casted away the
[47:26] substance of the wicked
[47:28] so the righteousness your righteousness
[47:31] is connected
[47:32] to you having i want us to see this
[47:36] because god will not suffer he will not
[47:37] allow the soul of the righteous to
[47:39] famish
[47:41] so your trust in the lord and you are
[47:43] choosing this path of righteousness
[47:47] blessed are they that hunger until after
[47:49] righteousness not only shall they be
[47:51] filled
[47:51] this is not just a spiritual connotation
[47:53] but he's saying here
[47:54] that the soul god will not allow the
[47:57] soul righteous to famish
[47:58] but he cast it away he will destroy the
[48:01] substance of the wicked
[48:03] all right verse 4.
[48:06] and this is where i say proverbs now
[48:08] even reaches into the realm of business
[48:11] he become it poor that deal it with a
[48:13] slack hand
[48:16] so if your hand slack then becoming poor
[48:19] is your trajectory
[48:23] let me say that one one more time right
[48:25] he becoming poor
[48:26] that dealing with a slack hand so
[48:28] brother isaac are you saying that
[48:30] that that god is interested in us not
[48:33] managing a slack hand
[48:34] and if you fix the slack hand in your
[48:36] life
[48:37] that you could actually avoid being
[48:40] poor according to this scripture
[48:45] this is some this is some deep things
[48:46] knowing all right so
[48:48] but he handled the diligent make it rich
[48:51] now
[48:52] this is about your thinking now this is
[48:54] about your mind
[48:55] i remember years ago i met people who
[48:57] making huge salary and spent not all day
[48:59] saving nothing
[49:01] and people making a fraction of what
[49:03] they make by the diligent deceive
[49:05] now that group who had a little who or
[49:07] didn't receive
[49:08] have more than those who had a slack
[49:10] hand it's the same reason somebody who
[49:12] wins the lottery
[49:14] who didn't know about having a a
[49:18] diligent hand
[49:19] it doesn't take too long for the money
[49:21] to disappear
[49:22] because a slack hand would lead to
[49:25] poverty
[49:26] so you can win the lottery and in two
[49:28] three years statistically do you know
[49:29] that statistically
[49:31] people who win the lottery within two
[49:32] years by the popular they have no money
[49:37] zero money you know after two years on
[49:38] average people were electronic two years
[49:41] the average score it was in two years
[49:43] they have no money at all it's as if
[49:46] they
[49:46] never had the lottery so it goes to show
[49:50] that
[49:50] it's not getting him an easy problem
[49:52] it's how you manage
[49:53] all right so he become employed at
[49:55] dealing with a slack hand
[49:57] but the hand of the diligent make it
[49:59] rich
[50:01] let's go on he that gather it in the
[50:04] summer is a wise son
[50:07] but he that's sleeping in harvest is a
[50:08] son that causes shame
[50:11] all right so these are parallels and you
[50:13] will recognize that exactly connected
[50:15] so this is talking about steven this is
[50:18] talking about
[50:19] understanding time and season
[50:22] because in the summer time you're
[50:24] supposed to be gathering
[50:25] you can't be sleeping anytime i have
[50:26] this you don't honest i know things work
[50:28] if that so
[50:29] this thing is about your life it's about
[50:31] your career it's about everything in
[50:32] here and i wanted to see
[50:34] how this is unfolding here all right
[50:36] blessings are upon the head of the just
[50:39] but violence covered the mouth of the
[50:42] wicked
[50:44] the memory of the just is blessed
[50:48] but the name of the wicked shall rot
[50:52] the wise in heart will receive
[50:53] commandments but operating fool
[50:56] will fall and preaching at me is a
[50:58] babbling fool
[51:00] so people talking talking talking
[51:01] talking
[51:04] the wise in heart will receive
[51:06] commandment but a praying fool shall
[51:07] fall
[51:08] he that walk it uprightly walk it surely
[51:12] but he that perverted his ways shall be
[51:16] known all right so this known here is
[51:20] about being discovered
[51:22] all right so i want to encourage you
[51:24] friends you have to walk uprightly
[51:27] you have to do things the right way
[51:30] because if you
[51:31] perverting his ways and your pervert in
[51:33] your ways
[51:34] or you're not doing it the right way
[51:36] it's only a matter of time it will be
[51:38] discovered
[51:40] anybody would be tonight hear that wink
[51:43] it with the eye this is about
[51:44] maliciously looking at something cause
[51:46] it's sorrow but again operating fool
[51:49] will fall
[51:53] the mouth of a righteous man is a well
[51:56] of life
[51:59] all right so in the amplified the mouth
[52:00] of the righteous the function of life
[52:02] and his words of wisdom
[52:04] are a source of blessing are your words
[52:08] a source of blessing to anybody or
[52:11] or are your words one of negativity
[52:15] do you know how important it is for you
[52:17] to speak positively
[52:18] into your life and those around you do
[52:20] you know that's a requirement
[52:22] do you know how much damage you do to
[52:24] children when you say you're not gonna
[52:25] amount to nothing
[52:26] and and and you're stupid you're what
[52:28] and when you say these things was the
[52:30] impact of these things
[52:35] the mouth of a righteous man is a well
[52:37] of life
[52:39] so if i want to look for a righteous man
[52:43] and one of the attributes of a righteous
[52:45] man is how he speaks it's a well of life
[52:48] are you a well of life and i want to
[52:49] read it from the amplified one more time
[52:51] the mouth
[52:52] of the righteous is a fountain of life
[52:54] and his words
[52:56] of wisdom are a source of blessing
[52:59] can people say that about you that when
[53:02] they speak to you
[53:03] that you when you speak it is words of
[53:06] wisdom that are a source
[53:08] of blessing are you a source of blessing
[53:11] to others
[53:12] and it's not just this is this is just
[53:14] being a blessing by your words
[53:17] this is you being an encouragement by
[53:19] your words this is you blessing somebody
[53:21] by your
[53:22] words all right
[53:26] but violence covered the moat
[53:30] of the wicked hatred stir it up stripes
[53:34] but love cover it all sins
[53:39] in the lips of him that hut
[53:41] understanding wisdom is found
[53:44] but a rod is for the back of him that is
[53:47] void of
[53:48] understanding
[53:51] in the amplified on the lips of the
[53:53] discerning
[53:55] skillful and godly wisdom is found but
[53:58] discipline and your rod are for the back
[54:01] of the one
[54:02] who is without common sense and
[54:04] understanding is the amplified one
[54:06] so when you see people in life and they
[54:08] say boy manga relics
[54:10] it's not just physical robbie talking
[54:11] you know it's the concept of discipline
[54:14] and punishment because
[54:15] i remember being when i was younger my
[54:18] dad had a statement
[54:19] if something internal don't control
[54:24] you something external will
[54:28] and that was code that was a code when
[54:32] you say
[54:33] if something on the inside who control
[54:35] me something external will
[54:36] and when you hear that you have to read
[54:38] between the lines
[54:40] and understand what that translates
[54:42] towards
[54:46] and the reality is for a lot of people
[54:48] that is how
[54:49] life still beats them upon
[54:54] because void of understanding they
[54:56] happen
[54:57] sought after understanding it cannot be
[55:00] friends after all these years
[55:02] in this message which is so rich of
[55:05] understanding knowledge and wisdom of
[55:06] god
[55:07] in fact not just rich but the fullness
[55:08] of it every mystery revealed
[55:10] that the simpler things in life is where
[55:12] we're tripping up
[55:14] does does it make sense all right and
[55:16] we're going to get to it in a bit
[55:18] verse 14 wise men
[55:21] lay up knowledge but the mouth of the
[55:24] foolish is near destruction
[55:26] you see again how much it is hitting
[55:28] against your mouth and your words and
[55:30] what you're saying
[55:32] you remember the prophet saying he could
[55:34] stand with somebody and in five minutes
[55:35] after talking let me know if they have
[55:36] the holy ghost
[55:38] anybody remember that quote he had to
[55:40] talk to him for five minutes and he know
[55:42] that the holy ghost
[55:43] in that same five minutes they cannot
[55:44] ever fool you talking to
[55:46] wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth
[55:49] of the foolish
[55:50] is near destruction
[55:53] the rich man's wealth is his strong city
[55:56] the destruction of the poor
[55:58] is their poverty the labor of the
[56:01] righteous tender life
[56:03] the fruit of the wicked to sin
[56:07] he is in the way of life that keep it
[56:10] instruction
[56:11] so solomon's making clear this way of
[56:14] life
[56:14] versus the way of death so if you want
[56:17] to be in a way of life
[56:19] you have to keep instruction
[56:22] but he that refuse it reproof through it
[56:25] so
[56:26] he that refuses instruction he who
[56:28] refuses guidance
[56:30] he who refuses advice is making a
[56:33] mistake
[56:34] let that not be your testimony tonight
[56:36] friends
[56:39] he that hided hatred with lying lips and
[56:42] he had uttered a slander is a fool
[56:46] these are these are so he is he is
[56:48] starting to make some definition now
[56:50] he will spread slander you know what
[56:51] land is his guess who anything for that
[56:53] kind of you know
[56:55] you have no evidence but your day you
[56:57] hear so and so do so and so
[56:59] and and that person is so and so on that
[57:01] person you have no evidence it wasn't
[57:03] you it's
[57:03] here say here say here say sometimes
[57:05] somebody say i heard someone say you
[57:07] know and it's also
[57:08] where your head from well i was in a
[57:09] maxi had some money back was talking
[57:11] about it
[57:18] in the multitude of words there wanted
[57:21] not sin
[57:22] but he that refrained it his lips is
[57:25] wise
[57:28] listen carefully to what that is in the
[57:30] amplified when there are many words
[57:33] transgression and offense are
[57:36] unavoidable
[57:38] in other words some of us will just talk
[57:40] too much
[57:43] when there's plenty talk going on the
[57:44] bible is saying transgression and
[57:46] offense are
[57:47] unavoidable but he who controls his lips
[57:51] and keeps thoughtful silence is wise
[57:55] so this is stressing on listen as
[57:57] brother braham say if you have nothing
[57:59] good to see someone is good to just say
[58:00] nothing you know
[58:05] this applies in your life in your job in
[58:07] your business in your
[58:09] marriage
[58:16] the tongue of the just is as choice
[58:19] silver
[58:21] i want this to catch that in the
[58:23] amplified the tongue of the righteous
[58:25] is like precious silver in other words
[58:27] greatly valued
[58:29] something that is greatly valued is
[58:33] why do we greatly value certain things
[58:36] diamonds gold whatever value
[58:40] is placed on things based on scarcity
[58:45] when something is scarce or rare
[58:49] it increases the value of it when
[58:52] something is in abundance
[58:53] the value falls so in economics and in
[58:56] the market
[58:57] if there is a shortage of sugar
[59:00] the value of sugar will rise that's all
[59:02] the souls will
[59:04] say so solomon is using a precious metal
[59:08] to parallel to how you use your tongue
[59:11] so the tongue of the righteous is like
[59:13] pressure silver
[59:15] meaning it is it has a great value
[59:18] and to to bring it here the heart of the
[59:20] wicked is little wood
[59:22] so it is underscoring the fact that he's
[59:24] speaking about value
[59:25] so the wiser you become you become more
[59:29] careful
[59:30] in how you use your words so you can't
[59:31] be saying anymore but this is me
[59:33] take me how i am and i say i don't put
[59:36] water in my mouth
[59:38] it's 40 years i end the message don't
[59:40] try to tell me how to say it no you see
[59:42] you see that you have to graduate this
[59:45] class
[59:48] you cannot say what you see is what you
[59:50] get that worked when you're a child
[59:52] when i was a child i speak as a child i
[59:54] understood as a child
[59:55] but when i became a man i put away
[59:57] childish things the same as they get
[59:59] more wise
[1:00:00] the words that come at your mouth become
[1:00:01] more precious
[1:00:03] like silver so when you speak people
[1:00:06] people want to hear you more
[1:00:08] because when you speak you're speaking
[1:00:09] substance
[1:00:11] that is why i say i reserve comment on
[1:00:13] all these political things local and
[1:00:15] abroad wherever it is
[1:00:17] because people saying what kind of thing
[1:00:19] i went away it is not silver
[1:00:20] [Laughter]
[1:00:23] i want when i speak it's precious silver
[1:00:26] i want when you speak especially silver
[1:00:28] i want when your son your daughter your
[1:00:30] neighbor your cousin your relative
[1:00:32] say tell me how i should approach
[1:00:34] something that you could
[1:00:36] hold back you could weigh it you could
[1:00:38] wear your words
[1:00:39] and when you give a response it will be
[1:00:41] like flowing of a blessing coming from
[1:00:43] you
[1:00:44] when that's ever happened people want to
[1:00:46] talk to you more you know
[1:00:48] anybody with me because you become a
[1:00:50] source of blessing
[1:00:51] you have to move above the can all
[1:00:54] conversation
[1:00:55] and a lot of what we're talking about
[1:00:56] here comes to what people see
[1:00:59] and i'm pushing it in the realm of the
[1:01:01] message because people say the wrong
[1:01:02] things
[1:01:05] with a lack of understanding all right
[1:01:07] so the tongue
[1:01:08] of the righteous it's like precious
[1:01:10] silver greatly valued
[1:01:13] the heart of the wicked is worth little
[1:01:15] and we're going on verse 21
[1:01:18] the lips of the of the righteous feed
[1:01:20] many
[1:01:22] the lips of the righteous feed many
[1:01:26] and in the amplified it means feed and
[1:01:29] guide
[1:01:30] many so this feed is not just
[1:01:33] it's not food we're talking about here
[1:01:35] no but feed and guide many meaning your
[1:01:37] words have such value
[1:01:39] that you are now a leader i'm not a
[1:01:41] follower anybody with me tonight
[1:01:43] so the pentecostals love to know about
[1:01:45] being the head and no detail and
[1:01:47] above and not beneath we're going now to
[1:01:49] say listen that that your righteousness
[1:01:51] that the lips of the righteous feed and
[1:01:53] guide many you no longer follow what
[1:01:55] you're actually providing guidance all
[1:01:57] right
[1:01:57] let's go on but fools die for want of
[1:02:00] wisdom
[1:02:03] the blessing of the lord it make it
[1:02:07] rich and he added no sorrow with it
[1:02:11] can we just pause there a little bit in
[1:02:14] the amplified the blessing of the lord
[1:02:16] brings true riches so solomon
[1:02:20] is speaking out about true riches and he
[1:02:22] adds no
[1:02:23] sorrow to it for it comes as a blessing
[1:02:26] from god
[1:02:27] so it means that god is interested in
[1:02:30] you having substance
[1:02:32] he's interested in you being blessed and
[1:02:34] once
[1:02:35] it is god's blessing there is no sorrow
[1:02:37] there's no stress with it because it's
[1:02:39] his blessing
[1:02:41] and his blessing is not tied to your
[1:02:43] effort you know remember we were talking
[1:02:45] about in proverbs 3
[1:02:47] in all ways acknowledge him and he will
[1:02:48] direct your path and all and all these
[1:02:50] things
[1:02:50] and when you do that there's a blessing
[1:02:52] that comes with it all right
[1:02:53] so the blessing of the lord did make it
[1:02:55] rich and he added no
[1:02:57] sorrow in it 23
[1:03:00] it is a sport to a fool to do mischief
[1:03:03] you know when people say i just joking i
[1:03:05] just kidding it's just a joke now
[1:03:08] and it's stupidness did they do it this
[1:03:10] is this is descriptive
[1:03:11] with them right here
[1:03:14] it is a sport to a fool to do mischief
[1:03:18] as far as you can send his kicks
[1:03:22] so what you will understand is the
[1:03:23] difference between having joy and doing
[1:03:26] mischief and finding it funny
[1:03:28] because kid behavior as we go deeper in
[1:03:31] scripture we're talking about maturity
[1:03:33] maturity not as an aids but maturity in
[1:03:35] terms of conduct and behavior
[1:03:38] anybody with me tonight right
[1:03:43] but a man of understanding had wisdom
[1:03:47] the fear of the wicked it shall come
[1:03:50] upon him but the desire
[1:03:52] of the righteous shall be granted
[1:03:55] verse 25 as the whirlwind pass it
[1:03:59] so is the wicked no more so the wind is
[1:04:02] blowing away
[1:04:03] but the righteous is an everlasting
[1:04:05] foundation anybody wants to be an
[1:04:06] everlasting foundation
[1:04:09] nothing could move you this is this is
[1:04:11] the foundation we talked about
[1:04:13] no much hurricane pass blow away the
[1:04:15] roof body foundation there
[1:04:17] come on now your roof go on and off by
[1:04:19] the foundation
[1:04:20] you can move the foundation all right
[1:04:22] you write just an everlasting foundation
[1:04:25] as vinegar to the teeth and i smoke to
[1:04:28] the eyes
[1:04:30] so is the sluggard to them that send him
[1:04:37] so he amplified like vinegar to the
[1:04:40] teeth and smoked in the eyes
[1:04:42] so is the lazy one to those who sent him
[1:04:45] to work
[1:04:47] so the bible talked about laziness and
[1:04:50] we preached about it but this applies to
[1:04:51] the natural inspiration
[1:04:56] verse 27 the fear of the lord prolonged
[1:04:59] days
[1:05:00] but the years of the wicked shall be
[1:05:02] shortened
[1:05:04] and it's really sad because you see the
[1:05:05] only time news here news and news here
[1:05:08] this gangster this bad boy it is
[1:05:09] whatever whatever life snuffed away
[1:05:12] it's scripture
[1:05:15] it is it is scripted being fulfilled you
[1:05:17] live a certain pathway
[1:05:19] you live a certain life it's really a
[1:05:21] matter of time
[1:05:22] because the principles of god are
[1:05:24] unbreakable all right
[1:05:28] the hope of the righteous shall be
[1:05:30] gladness but the expectation of the
[1:05:33] wicked shall perish
[1:05:35] the way of the lord is strength to the
[1:05:37] upright
[1:05:38] but destruction shall be to the workers
[1:05:41] of
[1:05:42] iniquity the righteous shall never
[1:05:45] be removed but the wicked shall not
[1:05:48] inhabit the earth
[1:05:50] the mouth of the just bringing forth
[1:05:52] wisdom but the floral tongue shall be
[1:05:54] cut out
[1:05:55] the lips of the righteous know what is
[1:05:58] acceptable
[1:06:00] but the mouth of the wicked speaking
[1:06:02] fraudness let me say that one more time
[1:06:05] the lips of the righteous no and in the
[1:06:07] amplified it says
[1:06:08] speak what is acceptable but the mouth
[1:06:12] of the wicked knows or speaks what is
[1:06:14] perverted or twisted
[1:06:16] so i want to make that point again not
[1:06:19] because
[1:06:19] your could say something means you
[1:06:22] should say something
[1:06:23] there's such a thing as acceptable to
[1:06:25] say or not see
[1:06:27] can i say that one more time we have to
[1:06:30] be sensitive
[1:06:31] to what is acceptable so the lips of the
[1:06:34] righteous
[1:06:34] know what is acceptable
[1:06:39] too many of us we are dangerous in how
[1:06:41] we use our words
[1:06:43] and words have a way of having a a
[1:06:47] dangerous effect on people
[1:06:50] let's move on to chapter 15.
[1:06:55] and this builds on acceptable and not
[1:06:58] acceptable on what we see
[1:07:00] it starts off with chapter 15 and
[1:07:03] chapter 15 speaks and i want to i want
[1:07:06] to focus this one
[1:07:08] particularly it's of everybody but i
[1:07:10] really want to focus on this one on on
[1:07:12] marriages
[1:07:14] a soft answer turn it away rather
[1:07:19] but grievous words stir up
[1:07:23] anger let me read it in the amplified a
[1:07:26] soft
[1:07:27] and gentle and thoughtful answer
[1:07:31] turns away wrath but harsh and painful
[1:07:34] and careless words
[1:07:36] still up anger let's just let that sing
[1:07:38] for a little bit
[1:07:42] conflict argument
[1:07:45] disagreement situation where people
[1:07:47] don't agree
[1:07:48] that is part of life
[1:07:52] it is impossible for people to be in the
[1:07:55] same room and
[1:07:56] agree on everything but over us preach
[1:07:59] it some people like juice
[1:08:00] some people like soft drink some people
[1:08:01] like apple pear grape
[1:08:03] that is life but how we respond
[1:08:07] to conflict how we respond to situations
[1:08:11] that maybe we did not expect so i said
[1:08:14] it before
[1:08:14] when we have an expectation that is not
[1:08:16] met that is when disappointment takes
[1:08:18] place
[1:08:19] so you're disappointed the food is not
[1:08:21] what they expected
[1:08:23] but your responsibility food had been
[1:08:25] expected you thought
[1:08:26] it was going to be roti but it's not
[1:08:28] roti you dreamed roti
[1:08:30] you put all the chicken for roti you buy
[1:08:32] the ingredients for roti you thought it
[1:08:34] was going to be roti you'll come home
[1:08:35] and evening and it's not roti
[1:08:38] and instead of you saying
[1:08:41] you know what you have okay no problem
[1:08:43] i'll work with this a soft and gentle
[1:08:45] and thoughtful idea
[1:08:46] soft gentle thoughtful soft so
[1:08:49] controlling decibels
[1:08:50] gentle there's no aggression and
[1:08:52] thoughtful you win what you're seeing
[1:08:54] determine where you're at
[1:08:56] you go and i make a whole certain thing
[1:08:58] and what you get back
[1:09:00] is more food than you thought you would
[1:09:01] get back because you get a whole plate
[1:09:03] full
[1:09:04] of harsh and painful and careless words
[1:09:09] i know that builds into something else
[1:09:11] and before i knew it but it would fall
[1:09:13] off the ring
[1:09:16] and all of this could have been avoided
[1:09:18] because you didn't
[1:09:20] treat it the right way so i want to
[1:09:23] encourage your friends
[1:09:25] a soft answer to the minute or where
[1:09:27] you're at
[1:09:29] and it's not just soft but when it
[1:09:30] really amplified soft and gentle and
[1:09:32] thoughtful so soft so control the volume
[1:09:34] check is that before i speak what volume
[1:09:36] am i on
[1:09:38] am i on volume one or ten if it's volume
[1:09:41] one to ten
[1:09:42] make sure you're bringing on your own
[1:09:44] volume
[1:09:45] gentle thoughtful turn turnaround try it
[1:09:49] it works it's scripture don't escalate
[1:09:52] situations in your house
[1:09:54] don't escalate it in front of your
[1:09:56] children
[1:09:58] so many things could have been avoided
[1:10:00] in life and in situations
[1:10:02] and this applies not just to couples it
[1:10:04] applies to young people
[1:10:06] who raise their voice
[1:10:09] and challenge their parents all of this
[1:10:11] is here a soft
[1:10:13] answer turn it away wrath but grievous
[1:10:15] words
[1:10:16] they still have anger the tongue of the
[1:10:20] wise
[1:10:20] use it knowledge or right so the tongue
[1:10:24] of the y
[1:10:24] speaks knowledge that is pleasing and
[1:10:26] acceptable so we were just talking about
[1:10:29] what is acceptable so you could know
[1:10:31] something
[1:10:32] and want to treat with something and by
[1:10:35] acceptable it means there's a better way
[1:10:37] to do it
[1:10:39] so you could you could know well
[1:10:42] you could notice your wrong way and your
[1:10:44] wife dude but
[1:10:45] but there's a was the best way to
[1:10:47] communicate this
[1:10:48] if you don't manage that this is wisdom
[1:10:50] we're dealing with now
[1:10:52] if you don't manage it this thing could
[1:10:56] backfire
[1:10:59] the tongue of the wise use it knowledge
[1:11:02] all right or the tongue of the wise
[1:11:04] speaks knowledge that is pleasing
[1:11:06] and acceptable but the amount of fools
[1:11:09] pour it out foolishness lord help us
[1:11:13] but a tongue of this of of of a body
[1:11:16] babbling
[1:11:17] but the babbling mouth of fool spouts
[1:11:19] fully
[1:11:21] so you know the problem no no but you
[1:11:23] just you just open and let's let the
[1:11:25] word just flow
[1:11:26] and your words is like atomic bombs
[1:11:29] you're blowing up everything
[1:11:32] so the food is not till you like it how
[1:11:34] do you treat your situation wise with
[1:11:36] the handler
[1:11:40] wonder panda
[1:11:45] hallelujah
[1:11:49] verse 3 the eyes of the lord are in
[1:11:52] every place beholding the evil
[1:11:55] and the good in the amplified the eyes
[1:11:58] of the lord are in every place watching
[1:12:00] the evil
[1:12:00] and the good in all their endeavors so
[1:12:03] it's about your activities
[1:12:05] all right verse four a wholesome tongue
[1:12:08] is a tree of
[1:12:09] life but perverseness therein is a
[1:12:12] breach
[1:12:13] in the spirit so a soothing tongue
[1:12:16] speaking words that build up and
[1:12:18] encourage is a tree of life
[1:12:20] i pray tonight that these words are
[1:12:23] building up
[1:12:24] and encouraging you and challenging you
[1:12:26] and this is by extension what you should
[1:12:28] be doing
[1:12:29] speak in words and build up and
[1:12:31] encourage but a perversive tongue
[1:12:33] this will be still in verse four speak
[1:12:35] words that overwhelm and depress
[1:12:38] and if i say crushes the spirit
[1:12:41] so our objective tonight is to build up
[1:12:43] is to encourage it
[1:12:45] you can do better you can find the
[1:12:46] acceptable words to speak to your
[1:12:48] children
[1:12:50] friends there's a key to every
[1:12:51] relationship you know
[1:12:53] but sunday want to talk to me what's the
[1:12:55] key what's the acceptable way to get in
[1:12:57] there
[1:12:58] if now in this season you don't
[1:13:00] understand how to reach your children or
[1:13:02] to reach your loved ones you lose them
[1:13:04] because there's so many distractions you
[1:13:06] have to find the acceptable way
[1:13:07] you have to this is where wisdom steps
[1:13:10] in all right
[1:13:12] a fool verse 5 15 we in chapter 15 verse
[1:13:14] 5.
[1:13:15] a fool despise it his father's
[1:13:17] instruction
[1:13:18] but he that regarded reproof is prudent
[1:13:22] there has to come a point in your life
[1:13:24] where you begin to look forward for
[1:13:26] correction
[1:13:28] where you want people to give you advice
[1:13:31] where you want people to tell you you
[1:13:33] might be going wrong you know
[1:13:34] you see it's a dangerous place to be
[1:13:36] where nobody can tell you anything you
[1:13:37] know
[1:13:40] and we see it in all aspects of life
[1:13:44] let me read this verse five in the
[1:13:46] amplified a flippant arrogant fool
[1:13:49] rejects his father's instruction and the
[1:13:51] correction
[1:13:52] but he who is willing to learn
[1:13:56] and regards and keeps in mind a
[1:13:58] reprimand
[1:13:59] acquires good sense so you have to have
[1:14:02] a willingness to learn
[1:14:04] i come to these meetings with a
[1:14:05] willingness to learn them
[1:14:09] i just happen to be the one sharing but
[1:14:11] i come with a willingness to learn
[1:14:15] and it's an attitude that you have
[1:14:16] because that's the only way you could
[1:14:18] grow
[1:14:18] where you're willing to learn and you
[1:14:20] can learn from anybody all right
[1:14:23] in the house of the righteous is much
[1:14:25] treasure but in the revenues
[1:14:28] of the wicked
[1:14:31] is trouble the lips of the wise disperse
[1:14:35] knowledge but the heart of the foolish
[1:14:38] do it not so
[1:14:39] you see the difference again and i see
[1:14:41] how much emphasis
[1:14:43] and i don't think many of us realize how
[1:14:45] much god
[1:14:46] places importance on the words coming
[1:14:49] out of your mouth
[1:14:50] and for us to understand the message we
[1:14:53] should understand the significance of
[1:14:54] this because when he sees them spoken
[1:14:56] with
[1:14:59] that is that is a part of our commission
[1:15:02] so
[1:15:03] if spoken word which is your original
[1:15:05] seed if you shall
[1:15:06] say to this mountain speak to the rock
[1:15:08] all these things
[1:15:10] it means that god now is is is placing a
[1:15:13] lot of focus on how you
[1:15:14] use what you see and not just
[1:15:18] what you say but how you say it because
[1:15:21] you could say the writing the wrong way
[1:15:24] so what you want to say is the right
[1:15:26] thing the right way all right
[1:15:30] the sacrifice of the wicked is an
[1:15:32] abomination of the lord
[1:15:34] is that an abomination to the lord
[1:15:38] but the prayer of the upright is his
[1:15:39] delight so
[1:15:41] solomon is really really powerful in how
[1:15:43] he brings this so the sacrifice of the
[1:15:45] wicked
[1:15:46] and there are many types here of the
[1:15:48] wicked that he's talking about as well
[1:15:50] but his sacrifice here is an attempt at
[1:15:52] spiritual sacrifice you know
[1:15:53] because he's contrasting this against
[1:15:56] the prayer of the upright it's his
[1:15:57] delight
[1:15:58] so god loves the prayer of the upright
[1:16:00] but when
[1:16:01] you operating and wickedness don't have
[1:16:03] to be external it can be wickedness in
[1:16:05] your heart
[1:16:06] when you come to bring a sacrifice to
[1:16:08] the lord god says an abomination
[1:16:11] i'm not moved by it an abomination is
[1:16:14] something that god hates
[1:16:16] because you're bringing a sacrifice but
[1:16:18] your heart in your heart is wickedness
[1:16:22] i want to challenge you friends let's
[1:16:24] look at ourselves through the word
[1:16:26] and let us fix the things that need to
[1:16:28] be fixed
[1:16:30] so he goes beyond verse eight spoke
[1:16:32] about his sacrifice and prayer and goes
[1:16:34] beyond
[1:16:34] verse 9 the way of the wicked so
[1:16:38] the the heart is one thing or the wicked
[1:16:41] or the sacrifice or the expression of it
[1:16:43] is an abomination but he said the very
[1:16:45] way of the wicked is an abomination the
[1:16:47] part where the approach of the awakening
[1:16:49] is an abomination
[1:16:50] but he loved him that follow it after
[1:16:53] righteousness
[1:16:56] can we follow after righteousness do we
[1:16:58] want to follow righteousness friends
[1:17:01] let's move on verse 10 correction
[1:17:05] is grievous unto him that forsaken the
[1:17:08] way
[1:17:09] i want to pause on this one
[1:17:16] let us read it again correction is
[1:17:18] grievous
[1:17:20] unto him that forsaken the way so we're
[1:17:22] not talking about now
[1:17:24] reproof about advice we're talking about
[1:17:26] people
[1:17:27] for signing ways backslide that's what
[1:17:30] forsaken anyway is
[1:17:31] all right so in the amplified he said
[1:17:33] there is severe discipline
[1:17:36] for him who turns from the way of
[1:17:38] righteousness
[1:17:41] so as you come to a greater level of
[1:17:44] understanding
[1:17:45] knowledge and wisdom and you understand
[1:17:48] this way
[1:17:49] you're walking in the way you understand
[1:17:51] what god expects of you
[1:17:52] you're moving in this pathway and you
[1:17:55] forsake this
[1:17:57] forsake this way he said severe
[1:18:01] discipline
[1:18:03] i want us to understand because to whom
[1:18:05] much is given much is required
[1:18:07] we cannot have all this word all this
[1:18:10] scripture all this revelation
[1:18:11] all this inspiration i'm going to ship
[1:18:13] with this i'm going to do what we want
[1:18:15] to do
[1:18:16] when we hear all night long without
[1:18:19] saying it the right way
[1:18:20] acceptable words avoid certain things
[1:18:23] don't pass by certain things
[1:18:24] don't do certain things don't listen to
[1:18:26] certain music don't have certain clothes
[1:18:28] in your closet don't have certain books
[1:18:29] don't watch certain movies let's bring
[1:18:31] it home now this is what he's talking
[1:18:33] about
[1:18:33] it's the way of the wicked not just the
[1:18:35] wicked the way
[1:18:36] there's a way there's a weird and wicked
[1:18:38] people operating there are things that
[1:18:40] they do
[1:18:41] there's music they live with there's
[1:18:42] what they feed their spirit
[1:18:44] guard your heart when we nail all this
[1:18:47] down and you can choose to do what you
[1:18:48] want to do
[1:18:49] then they see their discipline this is
[1:18:52] where the prophet would say now if love
[1:18:54] don't get you desperate then the
[1:18:55] conditions will because severe
[1:18:57] discipline
[1:18:58] will bring you back to the truth i
[1:19:01] much rather do it by loving my
[1:19:03] revelation than i'm gonna have to break
[1:19:05] my foot break my hand
[1:19:06] blow up my car do it to get back the
[1:19:08] attention to bring me back to the wood
[1:19:11] let us make a commitment to the
[1:19:14] discipline of the world we spoke about
[1:19:15] it before the
[1:19:16] discipline of the word
[1:19:20] correction is grievous so it's not just
[1:19:24] correction but
[1:19:25] so solomon is making a distinction
[1:19:27] between correction
[1:19:28] and grievous correction correction is
[1:19:31] not easy you know
[1:19:34] can i say that again people do
[1:19:37] it it is not natural for you to love
[1:19:39] correction
[1:19:41] you have to be careful somebody you tell
[1:19:43] somebody don't do things
[1:19:45] and you see them in church
[1:19:48] the kind of simple things you tell
[1:19:50] people to adjust their lives
[1:19:53] and they take offense for a year they
[1:19:55] holding out what
[1:20:00] and this is solomon going beyond
[1:20:02] correction just saying
[1:20:03] we'll turn up the heat on correction
[1:20:05] when you know what to do but you don't
[1:20:07] do it
[1:20:08] you know you're supposed to pray but you
[1:20:09] don't pray you know you're supposed to
[1:20:11] read the word but you don't really would
[1:20:13] because all that is forsaken the way
[1:20:16] and you will see this thematic element
[1:20:18] through all of these studies that we
[1:20:19] have done
[1:20:20] where god talk about because you're
[1:20:21] forsaking my commandments because you
[1:20:23] didn't keep my law because i didn't stay
[1:20:25] in my way
[1:20:26] these are the consequences of these
[1:20:27] things
[1:20:29] but we take it so casually
[1:20:32] until we have to hit our head against
[1:20:33] the wall to bring us into subjection
[1:20:36] and the discipline of the word why
[1:20:38] because god wants to give us an
[1:20:39] inheritance he wants to give us the
[1:20:41] spoken word and we cannot be careless
[1:20:43] with how we use words if out of our
[1:20:46] mouth
[1:20:46] will come power spoken word salvation
[1:20:49] spoken word healing spoken word
[1:20:51] deliverance
[1:20:53] can the church say amen correction is
[1:20:57] grievous
[1:20:57] unto him that forsaken the way and he
[1:21:01] listen now that hated reproof shall die
[1:21:06] so when you hear the psalmist david
[1:21:08] saying i shall not die but live
[1:21:10] to declare the words of here you have
[1:21:11] solomon i'll say listen
[1:21:13] if you hate reproof you shall die
[1:21:17] so death is tied to not getting
[1:21:19] correction
[1:21:21] isn't this powerful and i know parents
[1:21:25] would be concerned because any parent no
[1:21:28] matter how wrong your child are you want
[1:21:30] the best for your children
[1:21:31] you could have fallen out with them be
[1:21:33] in disagreement with them
[1:21:34] have not reconciled with them but in
[1:21:36] your heart you want the best for them
[1:21:40] i want to challenge you tonight if you
[1:21:43] have to reconcile with
[1:21:45] a son a daughter a family member i want
[1:21:47] to challenge you
[1:21:48] to pray and ask god this is the prayer i
[1:21:51] want you to ask god
[1:21:52] lord give me the acceptable way to reach
[1:21:55] them because that's what we're reading
[1:21:56] tonight
[1:21:58] the acceptable way is the right way
[1:22:02] you have love for your loved ones you
[1:22:04] have love for your son your daughter
[1:22:06] your brother your sister and you have a
[1:22:08] burden in your heart you could have the
[1:22:10] burden on how expressive burden the
[1:22:11] wrong way you know
[1:22:14] i heard years ago there were people in
[1:22:16] the message who you see somebody's
[1:22:18] street journal say
[1:22:18] you're jezebel are going to hell that
[1:22:20] that may not be the effective obtainable
[1:22:22] way
[1:22:25] being a fisher of men jesus called these
[1:22:28] happen to be fishes of men
[1:22:29] you can't bring fish by scaring them you
[1:22:32] can't bring fish by abusing them
[1:22:34] you can bring fish by ordering them you
[1:22:36] have a you have to put a beat
[1:22:38] you have to put a lure you have to put
[1:22:40] something to attract the attention
[1:22:43] and so too even in the prophet's
[1:22:45] ministry the first pull was about
[1:22:47] attracting the attention
[1:22:50] the first pull was signs and wonders so
[1:22:53] that people would see
[1:22:54] something be pulled to it and when he
[1:22:57] caught their attention then his second
[1:22:59] pull
[1:23:00] he was rebuking spirits bringing
[1:23:02] doctrine bringing clarity all these
[1:23:04] things
[1:23:06] but i want to hold in because a lot of
[1:23:08] the teaching tonight is focused on
[1:23:10] how we speak i know many parents with
[1:23:13] back seating children
[1:23:14] but you have been saying the right thing
[1:23:16] to them the wrong way
[1:23:23] the key to reaching them is to
[1:23:25] understand the acceptable way
[1:23:28] this is not compromising what you
[1:23:29] believe but it's going to god because he
[1:23:32] said if any man lacks wisdom let him
[1:23:33] answer it
[1:23:35] so if your approach has been failing it
[1:23:38] is time to
[1:23:39] take all these scriptures and this
[1:23:41] context we are building upon now
[1:23:43] and saying lord i'm now seeing the issue
[1:23:45] because you know maha's desire is to see
[1:23:47] my son
[1:23:48] reconcile to you maha desire to see your
[1:23:51] daughter reconcile to you not just my
[1:23:52] daughter but your daughter
[1:23:54] give me the acceptable words to use
[1:23:57] because the words i've been using have
[1:23:58] not been effective
[1:24:00] now i hear tonight that there's an
[1:24:02] acceptable way to bring reconciliation
[1:24:05] between my family there's an acceptable
[1:24:08] way
[1:24:09] to close the gap that's what we're
[1:24:12] fighting for tonight now this is the
[1:24:14] practical application of the word
[1:24:16] the acceptable way to say it in the
[1:24:18] prophet's word it's saying the right
[1:24:20] thing
[1:24:21] like sister hattie she said the right
[1:24:24] thing you could see the right thing if
[1:24:26] it's one lesson
[1:24:27] you leave with tonight it's this
[1:24:29] acceptable way
[1:24:31] ninety percent of what we spoke about
[1:24:33] tonight has to do with how you express
[1:24:35] how you speak you don't think your
[1:24:37] children who grew up in this message
[1:24:39] know right i'm wrong
[1:24:41] the sea that has been sown in their
[1:24:43] heart is real but the enemy
[1:24:45] tied them up
[1:24:49] but there is a key to unlock there is a
[1:24:52] grace to unlock
[1:24:53] there's a power to unlock
[1:24:58] can the church say amen
[1:25:06] verse 11 chapter 15 11 hell and
[1:25:08] destruction
[1:25:09] are before the lord how much more
[1:25:13] than the hearts of the children of men
[1:25:15] you know how powerful that scripture is
[1:25:17] this is saying that god could see
[1:25:20] straight into hell
[1:25:24] and solomon is making a comparison if
[1:25:26] god could see down what's happening in
[1:25:28] hell
[1:25:30] how much more he could look into the
[1:25:32] hearts of the children of men
[1:25:39] verse 12 a scorner
[1:25:42] loveth not one that reproved him neither
[1:25:45] will he go
[1:25:46] unto the wise so it's painting his
[1:25:49] character so yes yes yes
[1:25:51] there are people who don't want reproof
[1:25:52] there are people who don't want to go to
[1:25:54] the wise the people who don't want
[1:25:56] advice
[1:25:56] that people don't want to tell them what
[1:25:57] to do but you have to discern
[1:25:59] because any young person you talk about
[1:26:02] who has been here
[1:26:04] who has been under the covenant of this
[1:26:06] great message of the hour
[1:26:08] who have been turned off because of many
[1:26:11] times it's foolishness
[1:26:12] turn them off and seniors in a message
[1:26:15] who
[1:26:15] were inappropriate in their actions and
[1:26:18] behavior
[1:26:20] they are not trying to push away reproof
[1:26:22] and guidance they are looking for
[1:26:25] direction in a dark world can the church
[1:26:28] say amen
[1:26:30] let's build now verse 13 a merry heart
[1:26:34] make it a cheerful countenance so god is
[1:26:37] interested in you having a cheerful
[1:26:39] countenance
[1:26:40] people in this message walk alongside
[1:26:42] the president is that serious or was a
[1:26:44] serious hour a merry heart
[1:26:45] making a chair becoming you could be in
[1:26:47] a serious hour until i'm a chef
[1:26:49] you cannot be looking all sad depressed
[1:26:52] frustrated and attract anybody to this
[1:26:53] kingdom
[1:26:54] this kingdom is not full of people who
[1:26:55] are sad and depressed and frustrated
[1:26:59] your heart has to be merry yes your
[1:27:02] children give in trouble but there's a
[1:27:03] merriness in your heart
[1:27:05] based on the revelation that your house
[1:27:07] shall be saved
[1:27:09] and you are the wave sheet for your
[1:27:11] house can the church say man
[1:27:14] a merry heart make it a cheerful
[1:27:16] countenance but by sorrow of the heart
[1:27:18] the spirit is broken
[1:27:20] i'm gonna try a place to close off i'm
[1:27:22] not gonna reach my destination
[1:27:23] tonight but i trust that this has been a
[1:27:26] blessing to you tonight
[1:27:27] verse 14 the heart of him that had
[1:27:30] understanding secret knowledge so the
[1:27:34] more understanding so if you're getting
[1:27:35] understanding tonight and i trust
[1:27:37] i pray and i trust that your encounter
[1:27:40] with scripture
[1:27:41] is not just this bible study session i
[1:27:46] trust and pray that during the week and
[1:27:49] every day
[1:27:50] you make it your business
[1:27:53] today i find myself just using my phone
[1:27:56] and playing the bible on my phone just
[1:27:59] to hear the words
[1:28:00] while driving you have to figure out
[1:28:03] your system
[1:28:04] to get connected because if you're not
[1:28:06] connected to something you die
[1:28:09] you will die if you're not connected to
[1:28:11] something you will die
[1:28:14] but it's because i have understanding
[1:28:16] i'm striving just like you i'm striving
[1:28:19] the heart of him at heart understanding
[1:28:21] secret knowledge i want to know more
[1:28:22] about god
[1:28:23] i want to know how to live for god i
[1:28:25] want to know how to be effective to
[1:28:26] those that i meet
[1:28:28] i want to know how to move how to live
[1:28:30] in this hour
[1:28:33] but the amount of fools feed it on
[1:28:40] foolishness
[1:28:43] all the days of the afflicted are evil
[1:28:46] but here that is of a merry heart had a
[1:28:49] continual feast
[1:28:50] i love it better is little
[1:28:54] with the fear of the lord than great
[1:28:57] treasure
[1:28:58] and trouble deal with this is serious
[1:29:01] singing
[1:29:03] better is little with the fear of the
[1:29:05] lord
[1:29:06] this is dealing with people who they so
[1:29:08] want to get this i want to get this so i
[1:29:10] want to get this so when they get you're
[1:29:11] working overtime over time over time
[1:29:12] over time over time
[1:29:13] and with that over time and getting and
[1:29:15] getting and doing and doing and doing
[1:29:16] there's so much stress
[1:29:18] that they don't realize you know what
[1:29:19] let me just cut back on this here cut
[1:29:20] back this here
[1:29:21] and make sure that the fear of the lord
[1:29:25] is in my house
[1:29:27] that i take that time if you have
[1:29:28] children to spend a little time with
[1:29:31] them discussing the scriptures
[1:29:32] discussing
[1:29:33] how god works discuss any principles
[1:29:35] because you want success it's here
[1:29:37] you want to to to be achieving your job
[1:29:39] it's here you want to be successful in
[1:29:41] school it's here you want to be
[1:29:42] successful in marriage

[1:29:47] it's here
[1:29:49] better is little with the fear of the
[1:29:52] lord it's context
[1:29:53] there's nothing wrong with having much
[1:29:55] but if having much
[1:29:57] you lose the fear of the lord then it's
[1:29:59] better to have little
[1:30:00] will you fear of the lord if you could
[1:30:03] have much with the fear of your lord
[1:30:04] no problem but if getting much you lose
[1:30:08] the fear of the lord
[1:30:09] and you believe it's your ability it's
[1:30:10] your strength if you
[1:30:12] do it and if you study and you achieve
[1:30:14] and you work overtime
[1:30:15] and you build the thing up if you lose
[1:30:18] your balance
[1:30:19] and the fear of the lord because which
[1:30:20] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:30:22] if you lose it then god is better i get
[1:30:24] little
[1:30:26] better is little will the fear of the
[1:30:27] lord than great treasure
[1:30:30] and trouble dear with verse 17 better is

[1:30:39] of herbs
[1:30:40] where's our hooves there's the one um by
[1:30:43] george
[1:30:44] um is that one boy the watercress one
[1:30:50] better than a dinner of herbs where love
[1:30:52] is
[1:30:56] than a stored ox that stored
[1:30:59] ox is is a fattened ox
[1:31:04] stall meaning the ox couldn't really
[1:31:05] move because the ox so fat
[1:31:07] that he stole
[1:31:12] the ox car shut down
[1:31:18] is better is a dinner of herbs
[1:31:22] no meat just yes just
[1:31:25] [Laughter]
[1:31:29] in the hallelujah better that dinner of
[1:31:31] vegetables and herbs where
[1:31:32] love is present
[1:31:36] than a stolen ox and heat should deal
[1:31:38] with so you have good food and table no
[1:31:40] but it's hatred
[1:31:42] but you can get some herbs chop them day
[1:31:43] with love
[1:31:45] some vegetables that they would love and
[1:31:47] that's better and roasted
[1:31:49] roasted fattened ox the stored ox
[1:31:53] this ox so fat he can't even move that
[1:31:56] is the oxy and you have it by hatred
[1:31:57] in there
[1:32:01] let me try to close out
[1:32:05] a wrathful man
[1:32:08] or a hot-tempered man steward of strife
[1:32:12] but he that is slow to anger appeases
[1:32:15] strife
[1:32:16] verse 19 are trying to race into her
[1:32:18] clothes here the way of the slothful man
[1:32:21] is as a hedge of thorns swattleman is a
[1:32:23] lazy man so you see
[1:32:25] god is saying is is how you speak it's
[1:32:27] how you live it's how you control your
[1:32:29] emotions it's how you control your anger
[1:32:31] and he said is yakka be lazy so you
[1:32:34] can't tell me you're a christian and
[1:32:35] you're lazy
[1:32:37] it has scriptures in here and proverbs
[1:32:39] about how later you're sleeping in them
[1:32:41] you have david saying earlier will i
[1:32:42] seek thee you you're early as 11 a.m
[1:32:45] no i'm not deliberative working shift
[1:32:47] and thing but but
[1:32:48] it's a principle i guess that
[1:32:53] it's a it's a mindset
[1:32:56] so you have slothful man yeah i want to
[1:32:59] do nothing you know what to do yeah
[1:33:02] you just can't understand it
[1:33:05] the way of the slaughtered man is a
[1:33:07] hedge of tones
[1:33:10] but the way of the righteous is made
[1:33:11] plain
[1:33:13] verse 20 repeating a wise son make it a
[1:33:16] glad father
[1:33:17] but a foolish man despises his mother
[1:33:22] folly is joy to him that is destitute of
[1:33:25] wisdom
[1:33:27] but a man of understanding walk it
[1:33:29] uprightly
[1:33:31] i love verse 22 without
[1:33:34] counsel purposes are disappointed
[1:33:39] but in the multitude of counselors they
[1:33:41] are established
[1:33:43] this is a life principle it's a business
[1:33:46] principle it is where
[1:33:47] the concept of a board of directors
[1:33:49] comes from
[1:33:51] because you rap you surround yourself by
[1:33:53] people who could give you advice
[1:33:56] without counsel because you have to
[1:33:57] realize in life you don't know
[1:33:59] everything
[1:34:00] it's impossible for you to know
[1:34:02] everything but if you surround yourself
[1:34:04] in the
[1:34:05] multitude of counselors they are
[1:34:07] established so you have an endeavor
[1:34:09] you have a thing you want to do you have
[1:34:11] people around
[1:34:12] in the fellowship people who can give
[1:34:14] you the tools you need
[1:34:17] it's established
[1:34:20] let me try to close out here a man had
[1:34:24] joy by the ends of his mouth and a word
[1:34:26] spoken in due season
[1:34:28] how good is it and i will end with that
[1:34:31] verse tonight
[1:34:32] and my takeaway tonight friends
[1:34:36] in a spirit of reconciliation
[1:34:39] is as we read tonight finding the
[1:34:42] acceptable way
[1:34:45] the acceptable approach the acceptable
[1:34:48] way to speak
[1:34:50] the acceptable way to live and it's
[1:34:52] different from
[1:34:53] being right as opposed to wrong because
[1:34:56] you could have the right motive and
[1:34:58] objective and say it the wrong way
[1:35:00] and i believe i shared it last week i
[1:35:02] was in a meeting with somebody
[1:35:04] and the professional was there and they
[1:35:06] did it and i realized how we could have
[1:35:08] added value
[1:35:09] but it would have been foolish for me to
[1:35:12] go to that meeting and cut down the work
[1:35:15] that the other person did
[1:35:16] just to give you an update on that that
[1:35:18] person was able to say
[1:35:19] you know what it'll be a fantastic idea
[1:35:22] to work
[1:35:23] with this new team because they could
[1:35:25] take your vision beyond where we could
[1:35:28] that could already happen if the
[1:35:29] approach was right
[1:35:31] there's an acceptable way to do things
[1:35:33] and god has an expectation
[1:35:36] that we who profess who claim to be sons
[1:35:39] and daughters
[1:35:40] live in an acceptable way that's
[1:35:42] pleasing to god
[1:35:43] you believe that tonight so i want to
[1:35:45] encourage you friends
[1:35:47] understanding wisdom knowledge
[1:35:50] seek after it get it acquire it and i
[1:35:53] want to challenge you like i said
[1:35:55] close the gaps in your family close the
[1:35:58] gaps in your loved one
[1:35:59] don't just approach it anyhow we read
[1:36:02] the scripture
[1:36:03] the righteous man the wise man he
[1:36:06] considers
[1:36:07] before he steps he let us walk and put
[1:36:09] his foot and
[1:36:10] and hope he land where he's supposed to
[1:36:11] land he watches
[1:36:13] he wears it he's deliberate we talked
[1:36:15] about the
[1:36:16] precious silver of the words of the
[1:36:18] righteous that
[1:36:19] and the words of the wise that after a
[1:36:21] while you're such a way you start to
[1:36:23] reduce your word count
[1:36:25] your word count becomes smaller because
[1:36:27] your water becomes
[1:36:28] a little scarcer so when you speak it is
[1:36:31] valuable
[1:36:31] you have time for foolishness the fools
[1:36:34] have time for foolishness
[1:36:35] because out of the mouth of fools only
[1:36:36] proceed fully but ultimately wise and
[1:36:39] righteous is value it's a blessing it's
[1:36:42] an encouragement so i pray that tonight
[1:36:44] these few words broken from the book of
[1:36:47] proverbs
[1:36:48] from the mind of a man god anointed if
[1:36:51] the ministry
[1:36:52] of wisdom would be an encouragement to
[1:36:53] you shall we bow our heads to our word
[1:36:55] of prayer
[1:36:56] oh gracious heavenly father we thank you
[1:36:57] tonight for your love for your mercy
[1:37:00] for your grace to us lord in this bible
[1:37:02] study around the book of proverbs
[1:37:04] and lord we have had so many different
[1:37:06] studies that touch on so many different
[1:37:07] things
