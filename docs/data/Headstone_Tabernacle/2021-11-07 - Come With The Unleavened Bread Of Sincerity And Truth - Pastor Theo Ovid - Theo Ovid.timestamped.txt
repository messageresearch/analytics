[38:02] was in somebody spoke in french and
[38:05] there was an interpretation and there
[38:06] was three people that interpreted it all
[38:08] said the same thing it was in french and
[38:10] these were the words because
[38:12] daw was chosen the narrow part he says
[38:15] see
[38:16] i have to walk by yourself you have to
[38:18] walk by yourself i can understand that
[38:21] watch he didn't have to do it but he did
[38:23] it moses because there was chosen a
[38:26] narrow path the haraway though has
[38:28] walked of your own chosen
[38:31] and people do what they want to do
[38:33] i'm convinced of that i think this
[38:35] sunday's one month is awful sugar
[38:38] i'm not saying that from my from a
[38:39] health perspective i choose that i never
[38:42] thought i'd drink coffee without sugar
[38:44] that was poison altogether that was
[38:46] something almost impossible
[38:48] but i have done it i'm doing it and i
[38:50] recognize you know when people determine
[38:52] because i determined to see about me
[38:54] i determined to deal with what i have
[38:57] and the challenges i have otherwise i'm
[38:59] going to deal with it i would just sit
[39:01] down and move but no no i'm going to
[39:03] deal with it and if i could come to that
[39:05] spot that i could do what i have done
[39:07] then i could do other things too no
[39:10] wonder pause that i can do all things
[39:12] through christ that strengthened me

[39:34] oh give the lord some praises
[39:37] because ours chose the narrow part the
[39:39] hard way don't made you're walking your
[39:42] own choosing in other words i didn't
[39:43] have to do it i can side in and go with
[39:46] them if i want to but i stayed with what
[39:48] i want i stay with the world though i
[39:50] speak the precise decision it is my way
[39:54] because of this momentous decision a
[39:57] huge portion awaits thee
[39:59] now that's what i wondered when i die
[40:01] well then i happen to think heaven is
[40:04] not portion of the different portions of
[40:05] deer heaven is the kingdom of heaven
[40:07] that's within us
[40:09] that one waits for
[40:10] what a glorious decision god has made
[40:14] this in itself this decision
[40:16] is that which will give and may come to
[40:19] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[40:22] divine

[41:02] you see what community jonah means let's
[41:04] cross over now let's quit playing
[41:07] let's cross the other side now
[41:09] all because all belongs to us
[41:12] it's ours them visions never fail they
[41:14] can't feel because they come from god
[41:16] and i believe it with all that is within
[41:19] me we are not the highland that will run

[41:23] jordan the separation god breaks us the
[41:26] seals that's on the back of the book let
[41:28] us enter into this great place now
[41:31] for joshua devises the people's
[41:33] inheritance and if you notice
[41:36] those hebrew mothers when they was in
[41:38] their labor and gave birth to those
[41:39] patriarchs one of these days the lord
[41:42] will give birth to those patriarchs when
[41:44] they spoke their name she also
[41:46] positionally place them in the kingdom
[41:50] inspiration is a paradox
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] that's why some have it and some don't
[41:55] have it because inspiration is a paradox
[41:58] you just can't catch it it's inspired
[42:01] and god moves it into his right place so
[42:03] when the woman was groaning and said
[42:05] joseph that put him positionally it has
[42:07] to come with a groan that's why he said
[42:09] when a church is groaning under the
[42:11] persecution from the outside world that
[42:13] the holy ghost is just as real as it was
[42:16] to them on the day of pentecost when
[42:18] they are born and positionally born then
[42:20] god sets in the church no man said to
[42:23] nobody in no church god has to set
[42:25] people in the church
[42:26] fire have to come down you have to warn
[42:28] this fire glory to god don't come and

[42:48] god you have to love truth
[42:50] [Applause]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:01] so paul had to confront the christian
[43:02] currents
[43:04] for not
[43:06] acting upon a man
[43:08] who claimed to be a believer
[43:11] having a sexual affair with his father's
[43:13] for his for his father's wife
[43:16] and he telling them that to remove that
[43:17] man
[43:19] if there's an unbeliever doing that is
[43:20] wanting but not somebody who claimed to
[43:22] be a christian
[43:23] in other words
[43:24] that and then he went on further to say
[43:26] a little level there's level the whole
[43:28] lump
[43:28] that means one rotten apple goes by the
[43:31] whole bunch
[43:32] so we have to be concerned about rotten
[43:34] apples
[43:37] and get the level out
[43:42] don't come here with 11 we have to get
[43:43] it out
[43:44] that is what this is about
[43:47] hallelujah get 11 out
[43:49] and this thing called 11 we read about
[43:52] it that god introduced that when they
[43:54] was coming out of egypt
[43:56] he said eat it with bitter herbs
[43:58] don't put no level in it
[43:59] eat it in haste don't just eat it you
[44:02] know is it a certain way
[44:03] go eat it in a rocking chair put your
[44:05] shoes on your foot put your stuff in
[44:07] your hand because you're leaving here
[44:10] you're on a journey
[44:11] glory to god no guarantees you're on a
[44:14] journey
[44:15] you have to trust me come on now preach
[44:17] back to me preach back to me somebody
[44:22] now
[44:23] you may be seated they could understand
[44:25] why the bunch of them want to go back to
[44:26] egypt because egypt they had food
[44:28] guaranteed they eat bread to the full
[44:31] pharaoh was fixing them right because
[44:33] they allowed them to walk
[44:36] but no god tell me you're coming up and
[44:38] you had to walk by faith
[44:40] oh glory to god you're coming out
[44:43] you're stuffing your hand a little bread
[44:45] no ease in it
[44:47] unleavened bread oh glory to god here
[44:49] you eat lemon cut it off don't put
[44:52] nothing to it don't add nothing in it
[44:54] don't put your own thoughts in it don't
[44:56] put your ideas in it don't put your
[44:58] teachings in it say what the tapes say
[45:01] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:09] [Music]
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:12] you say turn that man over to the devil
[45:14] remove that level in the church
[45:16] get him out bring my fellowship better
[45:18] brother who's our fornicator hallelujah
[45:21] don't even mess with them don't leave
[45:22] them alone then they're nastiness leave
[45:24] them alone
[45:25] walk away from that
[45:26] oh glory to god a little level of the
[45:28] whole lump
[45:29] now sincere the word sincere is free
[45:32] from pretense
[45:33] or deceit
[45:35] proceeding with genuine feelings
[45:38] honest pure true
[45:40] the definition of sincere being in
[45:42] reality what it appears to be i like
[45:45] that
[45:47] so i see somebody saying something and
[45:48] afterwards you see a different behavior
[45:49] but i didn't know he was so
[45:51] it wasn't sincere
[45:53] maybe there are politicians
[45:55] you know politicians are sincere right
[45:58] the stallion light normal normal
[45:59] normally no they can keep the promise
[46:01] but they promising
[46:02] to get what a vote
[46:05] god is not a politician
[46:07] when he speaks he keeps his word
[46:10] that's why i love him
[46:12] the absence of pretense
[46:15] deceit or hypocrisy
[46:17] genuineness
[46:19] truthfulness
[46:21] having a character which corresponds
[46:23] with the appearance
[46:25] oh god give the lord some praises
[46:28] let's drill down a little bit
[46:30] sincerity is the virtue
[46:33] of one who communicates and acts
[46:36] in accordance with the entirety of their
[46:38] feeling beliefs and thoughts
[46:41] and desires is a manner that is honest
[46:43] and genuine
[46:45] oh glory to god
[46:47] so god's word
[46:49] of sincerity and truth
[46:51] as that word has the power to sanctify
[46:55] and to cleanse
[46:56] and you know jesus says sanctify them by
[46:58] thy truth
[46:59] thy word is true
[47:00] not somebody thoughts on ideas thy word
[47:02] is true
[47:04] second timothy says ye all that live
[47:06] godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[47:07] persecution but evil men and seducers
[47:11] will watch worse and worse
[47:13] deceiving and being deceived
[47:15] they themselves deceived
[47:17] and them receiving others
[47:19] oh my my my
[47:20] and if you amplify that word but wicked
[47:22] men
[47:23] and imposters will go from battle ways
[47:26] everything that bad now some of them
[47:28] always are ready but they're going from
[47:29] battle voice
[47:30] deceiving and leading astray others and
[47:34] being deceived and let away let us treat
[47:36] themselves
[47:37] but for you continue to hold to the
[47:40] things that you have learned
[47:42] of which you are convinced knowing from
[47:45] whom you learn them
[47:47] the worst person is a person in that
[47:49] convince
[47:50] you can't even be sincere because you're
[47:52] half-hearted
[47:54] you're you're neither on defense you're
[47:55] on the fence there you don't know going
[47:56] left you're going right you're just
[47:57] balancing the devil go throw you off you
[47:59] know you better get something to be
[48:01] convinced of and when they get convinced
[48:03] of it you could stand for it oh glory to
[48:07] god hallelujah i was convinced that
[48:09] women belong to some man all girls and
[48:12] so on have some husbands somewhere so
[48:13] don't fool with that nobody because they
[48:16] have a fool with them it's like a fool
[48:17] of somebody's wife i cause convinced
[48:19] that since a young man
[48:21] oh glory to god so i was in charge and i
[48:23] was taking a hold of my behavior and
[48:25] attitude towards woman oh give the lord
[48:28] a praise offering
[48:30] all glory to god because i wanted my
[48:31] marriage to work

[1:05:28] so this is what the kingdom's supposed
[1:05:29] to made of
[1:05:31] children
[1:05:32] sons and daughters
[1:05:34] with no hidden agenda
[1:05:37] with no hidden motive
[1:05:39] as to why you do
[1:05:41] i helping you you know because i wear my
[1:05:43] back
[1:05:46] no guy
[1:05:47] you help because you choose
[1:05:49] you give because you want you serve
[1:05:51] because you choose you love because you
[1:05:54] choose you worship because you choose
[1:05:56] you act because you choose you're
[1:05:58] responsible for your actions
[1:06:01] you don't say well because he before she
[1:06:04] because them and that is why you know
[1:06:06] how you move no you want to move or you
[1:06:07] move you're making them excuses you're
[1:06:10] not accepting responsibility for your
[1:06:11] action you're not going to get because
[1:06:13] that was chosen you will get better god
[1:06:16] has reacted
[1:06:19] that's not what they caught on the
[1:06:20] prophet because that was the artist you
[1:06:21] know because that was chosen you choose
[1:06:23] the hide away
[1:06:25] anybody could smoke and drink and carry
[1:06:26] around a woman
[1:06:28] die no hurting that what they were doing
[1:06:30] but when you choose to be a soldier
[1:06:32] a christian stands for principle stands
[1:06:35] for what is right you think right you
[1:06:37] speak right you act right you must come
[1:06:38] out right
[1:06:42] so when you stand up and connect to
[1:06:43] psalms one blessed is the man that
[1:06:45] walketh not in the conquest of the
[1:06:46] ungodly nor stand in the way of sinners
[1:06:48] nor sit in the seat of this conference
[1:06:50] but as the light
[1:06:52] is in the law of the lord and in that
[1:06:54] law that he meditated day and night he
[1:06:56] shall be like a tree planted
[1:06:59] not just thrown outside by waters
[1:07:01] whatever you're going to prosper so when
[1:07:04] prosperity prosperity hits you and your
[1:07:06] trees are the blossom what do you say
[1:07:09] your choice
[1:07:11] you choose
[1:07:12] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:07:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:18] but branham
[1:07:20] you say god
[1:07:22] at this altar every heart present here
[1:07:26] and around the nation may the waters
[1:07:28] from under the altar of god gush out
[1:07:30] this morning
[1:07:31] upon your church
[1:07:33] and water it
[1:07:35] you say lord
[1:07:36] for the seasons just about finish
[1:07:39] give it life
[1:07:41] the waters of life
[1:07:43] that it might be able to lay in the
[1:07:45] presence of the sun to be ripened for
[1:07:48] your great ground
[1:07:49] you see where god wants us
[1:07:51] to be ripened
[1:07:53] that ripeness is maturity
[1:07:56] yes that rightness is the quality of
[1:07:58] anchor
[1:07:59] that will possess your soul
[1:08:02] that they wouldn't react and act the way
[1:08:03] you do
[1:08:04] because it's just sure green you are
[1:08:07] and god doesn't have misclasses yeah
[1:08:09] jump from one to three
[1:08:10] you will go and do two
[1:08:12] and if you fail two you make it repeat
[1:08:15] because you have to get through two to
[1:08:16] go to three
[1:08:17] so the test will come hot and heavy one
[1:08:20] after each other to get you going right
[1:08:23] and if you know this as the principle of
[1:08:25] god you will begin to thank god for
[1:08:27] every test
[1:08:28] because the test really is trying to
[1:08:30] bring the best out of you
[1:08:32] whether it comes from your wife or your
[1:08:33] husband or your children or your family
[1:08:35] or the boss or the neighbor it doesn't
[1:08:36] matter where it comes from the test is
[1:08:38] the best that got to release to you
[1:08:40] because you are accounted worthy to be
[1:08:42] tested
[1:08:43] because god wants to pre-qualify you
[1:08:46] ah
[1:08:48] oh glory to god not all who say lord
[1:08:51] lord
[1:08:52] that all that came up was israel no god

[1:11:45] the first was a sign that the people
[1:11:47] could looked at
[1:11:48] the second was a sign that only god
[1:11:50] himself could do
[1:11:53] now on this third ministry
[1:11:55] it lays right
[1:11:57] straight back in the lap of the people
[1:12:00] now you know the first sign he had when
[1:12:02] people were sick and he hold him his
[1:12:04] hands used to show something of what's
[1:12:05] wrong with them
[1:12:06] and he could see they could see it on
[1:12:08] his hand see it a different reaction in
[1:12:10] his hands he will know yeah i can't say
[1:12:11] that to him and whatnot
[1:12:13] the second was discernment they know
[1:12:14] only god could do that your name is so
[1:12:16] and so your house number is so and so
[1:12:18] your streets and so and so you did so
[1:12:19] last night they knew that was god
[1:12:21] but listen to this one
[1:12:23] watch
[1:12:24] he says no but this third one
[1:12:27] he said
[1:12:27] if they'll come with sincerity
[1:12:30] talk about the people now
[1:12:32] no doubt at all
[1:12:34] watch
[1:12:35] the holy spirit operate itself
[1:12:38] it comes upon me and tell them just
[1:12:40] exactly
[1:12:42] it heals right there
[1:12:44] but they have got to come not with an
[1:12:46] emotional fate
[1:12:48] but with a solid fate to believe it's
[1:12:51] the truth
[1:12:52] see
[1:12:53] as god puts it right back in the
[1:12:55] individual lap again because it has to
[1:12:57] be that way
[1:12:59] because there's no power in man to heal
[1:13:01] so after a while you sit there and you
[1:13:03] believe the word being preached that's
[1:13:05] the truth
[1:13:06] and if that's the truth then god is god
[1:13:08] god can't lie
[1:13:10] then the true men that body could
[1:13:11] dissolve
[1:13:12] your cancer could disappear your female
[1:13:15] condition could be resolved whatever is
[1:13:17] aching you blood in you praise god your
[1:13:20] faith begin to move up nothing brother
[1:13:21] of it it's not faith in me when when
[1:13:24] that lay man was what peter said you
[1:13:26] think it is me he that man is faith in
[1:13:29] jesus name
[1:13:30] come on same as somebody
[1:13:32] so in other words your faith could move
[1:13:35] god to inspire the preacher to minister
[1:13:39] to you by the word that word come out of
[1:13:41] his lips that he was not even thinking
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:45] will be god ministering directly to you
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:52] hallelujah
[1:13:54] but
[1:13:55] it takes a humble heart
[1:13:58] dedicated to god to bring jesus christ
[1:14:02] into present tense
[1:14:04] if we're taking theology what would the
[1:14:05] persecution mess in this baptist
[1:14:06] catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a
[1:14:08] chance or support unknown people
[1:14:10] but it doesn't take knowledge
[1:14:12] say it doesn't take knowledge
[1:14:14] say it again it doesn't take knowledge
[1:14:17] so you do have to know everything it
[1:14:18] takes a humbler
[1:14:20] dedicated to god to bring jesus christ
[1:14:23] into present tense
[1:14:25] that's why they're going to take note
[1:14:26] with peter that they were
[1:14:28] ignorant and unlearned but they were
[1:14:30] declaring god
[1:14:32] their lives declared god their actions
[1:14:35] declared god they were manifesting god
[1:14:39] or give the lord a shout
[1:14:41] we don't need as much knowledge as we
[1:14:42] think but we need god we need the holy
[1:14:45] ghost and fire
[1:14:46] oh glory to god amen
[1:14:49] not thy power not by might but by his
[1:14:51] spirit i'll unfold this mystery and he
[1:14:54] will cry grace greece unto it oh my so
[1:14:57] not learning is the grace of god
[1:14:59] thank you jesus thank you lord jesus
[1:15:03] interestingly matthew 16
[1:15:05] dr finance very interesting scripture
[1:15:09] and when the disciples would come to the
[1:15:11] other side they had forgotten to take
[1:15:12] bread
[1:15:15] so then come breadless
[1:15:18] then jesus said to them take heed
[1:15:22] and beware of the level of the pharisees
[1:15:24] and of the sadducees
[1:15:27] and the reason among themselves seen is
[1:15:29] it because we have taken no bread
[1:15:33] which jesus perceive he says to them oh
[1:15:35] he of little faith why reason you're
[1:15:37] among yourselves because you have
[1:15:39] brought no bread do you not understand
[1:15:42] neither remember the five lows and the
[1:15:44] five thousand and how many passes you
[1:15:46] took up
[1:15:48] neither the seven loans of the four
[1:15:49] thousand and how many baskets you took
[1:15:51] up how is it then that you do not
[1:15:53] understand that i spake it not to you
[1:15:55] concerning bread but that you should be
[1:15:57] aware of the level of the pharisees and
[1:15:59] the sadducees
[1:16:02] then understood thee
[1:16:04] how that he speak
[1:16:06] not beware of the level of the bread but
[1:16:09] of the doctrine
[1:16:16] the doctrine of the pharisees and the
[1:16:18] services
[1:16:19] teachings
[1:16:21] it will send it to hell
[1:16:23] or the tribulation
[1:16:24] either one is terrible
[1:16:28] beware
[1:16:30] any man bringing any teaching or
[1:16:31] revelation that you can't find in the
[1:16:33] bible you can't find any prophet's word
[1:16:36] i don't care how much injuries they meet
[1:16:38] they can meet him last night yesterday i
[1:16:40] don't care which rank the angels have
[1:16:42] you come from this level at that level
[1:16:44] on that level fourth level fifth level
[1:16:47] paul said
[1:16:48] you know what paul said right if an
[1:16:50] angel
[1:16:51] come from heaven
[1:16:53] one way straight backwards
[1:16:54] yes
[1:16:55] and preach any other gospel
[1:16:58] running more channel
[1:16:59] yes yes yes show him where the exit is
[1:17:01] you know
[1:17:02] i look at how light and bright he is you
[1:17:04] know some people oh god
[1:17:07] yeah what do you say all i want to do is
[1:17:08] jersey
[1:17:11] because angel better speak that word
[1:17:14] so if you don't know the word you'll be
[1:17:15] deceived all right and strange enough
[1:17:18] right after that when jesus came to the
[1:17:20] coast of caesarea philippi he asked
[1:17:22] disciples who women say that that they
[1:17:23] said manner
[1:17:26] some said i was johnny baptist he said
[1:17:28] whom do you say that i am and that's
[1:17:30] where peter said that were the christ
[1:17:31] the sons of the living god
[1:17:33] and what was it it was heaven drop down
[1:17:35] upon peter and give him divine
[1:17:38] revelation do you have that this morning
[1:17:40] divine revelation you have to have that
[1:17:42] you know because you say upon this rock
[1:17:44] i've been my church this is not the
[1:17:46] church he bill you know
[1:17:47] this had some time after building that
[1:17:48] jesus building we build this
[1:17:51] the church he talked about here that's
[1:17:52] the rock of revelation
[1:17:54] that is to be built inside your heart
[1:17:57] because when you get that rock nobody
[1:17:58] can take it out
[1:17:59] nope listen no pope no bishop no no man
[1:18:03] no woman wife
[1:18:04] nothing could separate you from the love
[1:18:06] of god that connected inside of them
[1:18:08] wife or no wife husband or husband
[1:18:11] boyfriend or no boyfriend girlfriend or
[1:18:13] not girlfriend it doesn't matter you
[1:18:14] know
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:16] faith of all fathers
[1:18:19] living still
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:22] so in the amplified the scripture we
[1:18:24] read he said purge clean out the old
[1:18:26] level that you will be fresh new dough
[1:18:29] still uncontaminated as you are
[1:18:32] for christ
[1:18:33] our passover has been sacrificed
[1:18:36] therefore let us keep the feast not at
[1:18:38] all level nor with the level of vice and
[1:18:41] malice and wickedness but with the
[1:18:44] unleavened bread of purity
[1:18:46] nobility honor and sincerity and
[1:18:49] unadulterated truth
[1:18:51] do you know what malice is
[1:18:53] you know you hear the word malice you
[1:18:55] know what malice is malice is the desire
[1:18:58] to harm someone
[1:19:02] now when paul talks about malice he's
[1:19:04] not talking about unbelievers you know
[1:19:05] themselves already
[1:19:07] no
[1:19:08] you don't want to treat folks
[1:19:12] having malice
[1:19:14] malice is ill will
[1:19:16] wrong intention desire to cause pain and
[1:19:19] injury
[1:19:21] or distress to one another
[1:19:24] again i'm thundery
[1:19:27] we will give it on the right back
[1:19:29] we have seven for you
[1:19:33] no it's a brother coming to me
[1:19:45] i go let somebody come from outside the
[1:19:46] community
[1:19:48] i light fire under the behind they've
[1:19:50] run out as fast as they're coming
[1:19:53] oh hallelujah this is not your father's
[1:19:55] house this is my father's house
[1:19:57] oh glory to god my father's house can't
[1:20:00] be a denative and a bunch of rascals we
[1:20:02] come out of the world not to find the
[1:20:04] world inside of here we leave back them
[1:20:06] things to find something different we'll
[1:20:07] give the lord a shout
[1:20:10] get delivered out
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:15] all right
[1:20:16] let's hit the home stretch
[1:20:18] for the brain
[1:20:21] jesus went to the wilderness to fast
[1:20:24] after the holy ghost come upon him
[1:20:28] not before
[1:20:30] for the holy ghost to come on him but he
[1:20:31] went in and fasted after
[1:20:34] the holy ghost came upon him now
[1:20:36] in the vision to talk about the vision
[1:20:39] i was about three o'clock in the morning
[1:20:41] i suppose i've gotten up i looked there
[1:20:43] in front of me
[1:20:44] it was coming down to the jordan
[1:20:46] it looked like i was standing on the map
[1:20:48] of palestine
[1:20:50] i was coming down to the jordan seemed
[1:20:52] like i could hear the song i'm going
[1:20:54] down to jordan someone was singing it
[1:20:55] and i drew near the river i looked back
[1:20:59] and seeing which way i come
[1:21:01] i was tutors of the way dear to the
[1:21:03] jordan
[1:21:04] and i look across jordan and i said oh
[1:21:06] praise god just on the other side is
[1:21:08] where all the promises lay every
[1:21:10] promised lay in the promised land
[1:21:12] then i came to myself i thought could i
[1:21:14] have possibly could i have been dreaming
[1:21:17] because it was nighttime
[1:21:19] and a vision
[1:21:20] is something that you see with your eyes
[1:21:22] open like a dream you're looking right
[1:21:24] at it you're conscious that you are
[1:21:26] standing there on a platform and you're
[1:21:28] standing there but when you look like
[1:21:30] you're in a dream you can't explain it
[1:21:32] there's no way to do it
[1:21:34] then i sit there a little bit aside on
[1:21:37] this chair all of a sudden he'd come
[1:21:39] back again
[1:21:40] then i knew it was a vision
[1:21:42] then
[1:21:43] when i come into the vision again
[1:21:46] it seemed that i was lifted up sitting
[1:21:48] on a highway a narrow highway with some
[1:21:50] brother i never knew who the brother was
[1:21:52] i look around i said now i'm sure i know
[1:21:54] this is a vision the lord god is here it
[1:21:57] seemed like everybody was afraid
[1:22:00] and i said what is everybody so afraid
[1:22:03] of
[1:22:04] and a voice came and said there is such
[1:22:06] danger in these days
[1:22:08] there's a great hideous thing that is
[1:22:10] dead when it strikes you
[1:22:11] i heard the weeds mashing down
[1:22:14] and i look and here come a huge
[1:22:16] monster snake
[1:22:18] crawling through the weeds i taught now
[1:22:20] knowing this is a vision then i shall
[1:22:22] see what this animal obese is
[1:22:25] he crawled up on the highway
[1:22:27] and as soon as i got sight of him i knew
[1:22:29] it was a mamba
[1:22:30] now amanda is an african snake which is
[1:22:33] the most deadly bite of all thing there
[1:22:35] is
[1:22:36] there is nothing as poison as a member
[1:22:39] the snake of course represents sin and
[1:22:40] death
[1:22:42] now
[1:22:42] he said no when we go to africa in india
[1:22:45] we find they have the cobra there's a
[1:22:46] black cobra he's a bad snake he's a dead
[1:22:49] bite too there's a yellow cobra which is
[1:22:51] far beyond him and the yellow cobra the
[1:22:53] patient dies with such a horrible that
[1:22:54] it dies from suffocation
[1:22:56] it paralyzes the breeding system they
[1:22:59] can't breed just open their mouth and
[1:23:00] gap trying to and die like that and
[1:23:03] that's the type of snake that was one
[1:23:05] lick from getting billy paul when we got
[1:23:07] the snake in africa
[1:23:09] and here comes the man but he is dead he
[1:23:12] is so fast you can't see him he goes
[1:23:14] over the top of the weeds and propels
[1:23:16] himself with the back of his steel just
[1:23:17] whoosh and he's going to hit you in the
[1:23:19] face usually stands up high and strikes
[1:23:22] hard and when he hits you you've got a
[1:23:24] few breaths till you're finished
[1:23:26] it don't he said turn real it it don't
[1:23:29] only paralyze you it gets into the
[1:23:31] bloodstream it gets the news everything
[1:23:33] you die just in a few seconds
[1:23:35] damn native boys and track boys you can
[1:23:37] say mamba and butt the head scream and
[1:23:40] running
[1:23:40] it's dead in a few seconds when i hit
[1:23:42] you
[1:23:43] and here he was on the highway i thought
[1:23:45] well this is it
[1:23:46] so i looked at him he looked angry at me
[1:23:50] and he licked his tongue
[1:23:51] and here he come
[1:23:53] but when he come close to me he would
[1:23:56] run up fast and then he would get slower
[1:23:58] and slower and quiver and stop
[1:24:00] and something would hold him off
[1:24:04] he wouldn't bite me
[1:24:05] and he would turn around on the other
[1:24:07] side and try to approach from this side
[1:24:09] and he would get back and get a stab
[1:24:11] swish right around towards me get slower
[1:24:13] slower and then stop and he would shake
[1:24:16] like that and move back he couldn't
[1:24:18] strike me
[1:24:19] then he turned
[1:24:21] and look at my friend
[1:24:23] and away he went after my friend
[1:24:26] and i see my friend just jumping up in
[1:24:28] the air and over him and over here and
[1:24:30] over him trying the thing was striking
[1:24:32] at him and he thought oh if it ever hits
[1:24:34] him it will be instant dead no wonder
[1:24:36] everybody is scared because this thing
[1:24:39] hits you it's instant death it was just
[1:24:42] striking at him like that and i threw my
[1:24:44] hands up and said oh god have mercy on
[1:24:46] my brother i said if that supper ever
[1:24:48] strikes him it will kill him
[1:24:50] and just then
[1:24:52] the serpent turned to me
[1:24:54] when i said that and look at me again
[1:24:57] and a voice came from above me said you
[1:25:00] have been given power
[1:25:02] to bind him
[1:25:04] the worst or any
[1:25:10] now watch this
[1:25:11] the snake couldn't bite him
[1:25:14] he was protected
[1:25:16] his burden switched to his brother
[1:25:19] that was on the run
[1:25:21] so it wasn't about him
[1:25:23] or give the lord some shouts it was
[1:25:26] about his brother
[1:25:28] isn't that right and when he said god
[1:25:30] have mercy for my brother
[1:25:32] voice drop down and say you have been
[1:25:34] given
[1:25:35] not i will give you have been given
[1:25:38] power
[1:25:39] power to bind him
[1:25:41] the worst
[1:25:43] or any
[1:25:44] oh glory to god
[1:25:46] hallelujah
[1:25:48] listen to birmingham response after that
[1:25:51] voice
[1:25:52] i said well god what must i do
[1:25:58] so he didn't say yagin power okay
[1:26:01] wait wait wait man
[1:26:03] no
[1:26:04] lord
[1:26:05] what must i do he said there is one
[1:26:09] thing you must do
[1:26:11] you must be
[1:26:13] more sincere
[1:26:20] no they know the preacher we talking
[1:26:21] about
[1:26:22] he's a prophet
[1:26:25] this is dealing with others now
[1:26:27] this is dealing with being given power
[1:26:31] and what it will take to manage
[1:26:34] what has been given to us
[1:26:38] he said there is one thing you must do
[1:26:40] you must be more sincere
[1:26:42] see you must be more sincere
[1:26:44] i said well
[1:26:46] god forgive me
[1:26:48] for my insincerity
[1:26:50] and let me have
[1:26:52] sincerity
[1:26:53] and when i raise up my hands to him
[1:26:55] again
[1:26:56] there was a great something came over me
[1:26:59] that lifted me up
[1:27:01] it seemed like my whole body was
[1:27:03] charged
[1:27:04] with something
[1:27:06] after what when he said forgive me lord
[1:27:09] for insincerity give me
[1:27:11] sincerity
[1:27:13] we have to come with the unleavened
[1:27:14] bread of
[1:27:16] sincerity
[1:27:17] and we can't come as we normally do
[1:27:20] something has to change
[1:27:21] i trust something changed this morning
[1:27:24] when i look at the serpent then he
[1:27:26] started towards me
[1:27:27] and he couldn't do it yet
[1:27:29] so this open take a tune back in him
[1:27:31] again
[1:27:32] and he said satan
[1:27:34] in the name of the lord jesus christ i
[1:27:36] bind you
[1:27:37] and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of
[1:27:40] him he's a spiritual component
[1:27:42] like the blue smoking name
[1:27:44] a blue smoke flowed on him and he curled
[1:27:46] up and make like an unsigned backward
[1:27:48] sign
[1:27:49] and and bind this one or anything below
[1:27:51] him because he was the worst blue smoke
[1:27:54] fell out of him and he still choked his
[1:27:56] own self to death around his head when
[1:27:59] he made this backward s and sign like
[1:28:01] that and the brother was free
[1:28:04] i went over and mashed on it i said no
[1:28:07] i've got to find out about this because
[1:28:09] it's a vision
[1:28:10] i hit on the thing it turned like it
[1:28:13] looked like a handle like a glass and a
[1:28:14] picture and just made it into solid
[1:28:16] crystal think of that how quick the blue
[1:28:19] smoke was life and everything had left
[1:28:21] it all the elements turned to glass and
[1:28:24] then a voice came on me and said you can
[1:28:26] unbind him also
[1:28:29] and i said satan that i might know
[1:28:35] i unbind you
[1:28:37] and when it did he started coming to
[1:28:40] life again
[1:28:41] wiggling and i said i'd buy you back
[1:28:43] in the name of jesus christ
[1:28:45] you you carry them on buying for too
[1:28:47] long
[1:28:49] that is trouble
[1:28:50] he said that i might know i can bang you
[1:28:52] and as he said come on i bang you back
[1:28:54] in the name of jesus christ
[1:29:01] and then he choked himself right back
[1:29:02] and turned to crystal when he did that
[1:29:04] the voice said no you must be more
[1:29:06] sincere than what you are
[1:29:09] to do this
[1:29:14] can we worship the lord
[1:29:20] then it left me
[1:29:23] and i was standing in the room
[1:29:25] a few moments
[1:29:27] i heard a clock go off and my wife
[1:29:29] getting up the cheering you know your
[1:29:31] house what i'm gonna wear today mama
[1:29:33] where are my books what did i do you
[1:29:35] know
[1:29:36] so i stepped off to the den room and i
[1:29:37] got to my knees and i said lord jesus
[1:29:40] i don't know these things
[1:29:42] what must i do
[1:29:44] and the children will be calling me to
[1:29:46] take them to school in a few moments
[1:29:47] what must i do
[1:29:49] i looked around
[1:29:50] and my bible was laying dear i said lord
[1:29:52] if you would forgive me
[1:29:54] i do not believe in opening up the
[1:29:55] scripture and taking something out of
[1:29:56] the bible saying but in the times when
[1:29:59] god can comfort you by such a thing i
[1:30:01] said lord in this case of emergency
[1:30:03] right now before your spirit leaves me i
[1:30:06] i don't know what to do the kids will be
[1:30:09] in an hour yet before they'll be gone
[1:30:11] would you show me if there's something
[1:30:13] you're trying to get to me heavenly
[1:30:14] father then let me know
[1:30:16] and i took the bible and pulled it open
[1:30:19] and my tongue was laying on first
[1:30:20] corinthians
[1:30:22] the fifth chapter
[1:30:24] the eighth verse
[1:30:25] when something reads something like when
[1:30:27] you come i was planning on taking a fast
[1:30:29] to the lord and i told him i would go
[1:30:31] out and fast he said when you come to
[1:30:33] the feast which is the fast in the body
[1:30:36] is a feast with the lord we know that
[1:30:38] when you come to this feast don't come
[1:30:40] with the old living of malice and so
[1:30:42] forth but come with the unleavened bread
[1:30:45] of sincerity and truth
[1:30:47] just exactly what he told me the vision
[1:30:50] and this is where i get the title from
[1:30:52] come god is my solid judge come with the
[1:30:55] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:30:58] that is the word could we give the lord
[1:31:00] some praises
[1:31:03] that is where i get a title of the
[1:31:04] message from
[1:31:06] then i seen what he meant
[1:31:09] as he years ago when i seen the bible
[1:31:12] come down i got it right here and a hand
[1:31:14] came from heaven and pointed down to
[1:31:16] joshua and i read the first nine verses
[1:31:18] and stopped there and that was joshua
[1:31:21] come to the wilderness but he was ready
[1:31:23] when he was near jordan god called him
[1:31:25] and said this day i'll begin to magnify
[1:31:28] you before the people and then he took
[1:31:30] the children of israel across jordan
[1:31:32] i went to the woods and prayed
[1:31:35] and prayed
[1:31:36] and fasted
[1:31:38] and i went back to the tree where i had
[1:31:40] met those squirrels were you heard the
[1:31:41] other message and so forth and i met god
[1:31:44] god helped me to live through i'm almost
[1:31:47] done
[1:31:48] mission quran please
[1:31:50] border man
[1:31:52] in studying the history of the church
[1:31:55] life of sin martin
[1:31:57] and all dawn
[1:31:59] he says they followed a man right on to
[1:32:02] his life how he raised two dead people
[1:32:04] cast out evil spirits spokes around
[1:32:06] tongues seeing vision and things
[1:32:08] when a great man but yet
[1:32:10] the very secret of his power was in
[1:32:12] humility
[1:32:14] before god
[1:32:15] and we find today that the church yet
[1:32:18] teaching its power and teaching the
[1:32:20] scientific believer yet we find them
[1:32:22] puffed out big me little you
[1:32:24] that isn't like the early church you see
[1:32:27] are you ready
[1:32:28] they were humble
[1:32:30] kind to one another
[1:32:32] and sweet somebody showed out sweet
[1:32:36] there's not sweet like sweet to suck
[1:32:38] like sweetie
[1:32:40] this is sweet to each other
[1:32:42] oh my they were sweet
[1:32:45] understanding it was so much different
[1:32:47] today and i wonder if a lot of this
[1:32:49] hasn't sidetracked us from the real
[1:32:51] kernel of the message
[1:32:54] that we want to humble ourselves
[1:32:57] and keep yourselves the more humbler you
[1:33:00] can be the better god will use you
[1:33:04] probably give the lord a shout on that
[1:33:06] one
[1:33:07] the more humble we can be
[1:33:10] the better god will use you
[1:33:13] so many people today are open up their
[1:33:14] hearts to the wrong things you get a
[1:33:16] spirit all right but many times it
[1:33:17] contradicts the word
[1:33:19] see that's the devil under the
[1:33:20] disguisement of christianity god help us
[1:33:23] when we get down into this a bit and you
[1:33:25] receive an evil spirit in the
[1:33:27] disguisement of christianity
[1:33:30] instead of humility and power of the
[1:33:31] spirit you've got the word without the
[1:33:33] spirit
[1:33:35] hallelujah and you do more harm than you
[1:33:37] would if you were like the rest of them
[1:33:39] what's the trouble today they have so
[1:33:41] many revelations and false things it is
[1:33:44] prostrating themselves out there and
[1:33:46] open up their hearts to devils instead
[1:33:48] of staying with the word of god that's
[1:33:50] the trouble
[1:33:51] that is what matters oh my i'm almost
[1:33:54] done
[1:33:55] many people say
[1:33:57] if the lord will take this evil spirit
[1:33:59] from me from drinking from gambling from
[1:34:02] lying or stealing or serving but that's
[1:34:04] up to you
[1:34:06] you have got something to do too
[1:34:08] they don't overcome shall inherit all
[1:34:09] things they are overcome you have power
[1:34:11] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[1:34:13] it down
[1:34:14] she has made herself ready you see god
[1:34:17] couldn't push us through a pipe and pull
[1:34:19] us to the other end and say blessed he
[1:34:21] will overcome it you had nothing to
[1:34:22] overcome he just pushed you through but
[1:34:24] you have got to make decisions yourself
[1:34:28] because though has chosen you've got to
[1:34:30] do what
[1:34:31] make decisions yourself
[1:34:34] hallelujah
[1:34:35] watch
[1:34:37] and i have to make decisions for myself
[1:34:39] and in doing that we show our feet
[1:34:42] and respects to god
[1:34:44] brother branham you talk about i want to
[1:34:47] see my church
[1:34:48] the church of god in deep sincerity i
[1:34:51] want to see the old-fashioned pramitans
[1:34:53] i want to see them times when they can
[1:34:55] can't leave the church they stay all
[1:34:57] night and pray and fast and call until
[1:34:59] god answers
[1:35:00] is i think one of the things that keep
[1:35:02] our people from being healed is a lack
[1:35:04] of confession
[1:35:05] it's a lack of sincere confession for
[1:35:07] instance this might sound a little bit
[1:35:09] bad i don't mean it in this way but
[1:35:11] looking at my wife here what if i go out
[1:35:14] here today throw my hands around another
[1:35:16] woman make love to her and i know after
[1:35:18] i did that i was wrong so wrong of
[1:35:21] course my comforter would keep me from
[1:35:22] doing that see but i mean if i did that
[1:35:25] and it happened that i didn't or
[1:35:27] anything similar to it then i would the
[1:35:29] first thing is to say to my wife before
[1:35:31] i could say to god forgive me because i
[1:35:34] sinned against her
[1:35:35] if you come to the altar and remember
[1:35:37] you have an ought go make that right
[1:35:39] first
[1:35:40] because you can't plug into the sauce if
[1:35:42] you have an oat
[1:35:45] do you get that
[1:35:47] see if you come at the altar and you say
[1:35:48] lord i want you to heal me we have a
[1:35:50] great oat against it and so and so go go
[1:35:52] go heal you you're not plugged in you
[1:35:54] have to plug into the source by obeying
[1:35:56] what he said go there sister says sister
[1:35:58] i'm sorry please forgive me and then
[1:36:00] come back to the old and say lord i
[1:36:01] already know
[1:36:03] fire
[1:36:04] i come from a healer now
[1:36:06] healing the children's bread pika
[1:36:09] glory to god amen
[1:36:11] so whatever happened i did so
[1:36:13] and similar to it and i know the first
[1:36:15] thing is to say to my wife before i
[1:36:16] could say to god forgive me because i
[1:36:18] sin against her and if you come to the
[1:36:20] altar remember you have an odd go i made
[1:36:22] a right first before you offer your gift
[1:36:24] so i've got to go to her i believe in
[1:36:25] confession is straighten up also but
[1:36:28] what if i said i'm going to confess it
[1:36:30] i've done wrong and i said lord god oh
[1:36:32] oh friend of mine you know what i know
[1:36:34] you real well praise the lord i think
[1:36:36] you're a good old fellow forgive me you
[1:36:38] know old friend i didn't mean it that
[1:36:40] way see
[1:36:41] that's sacrilegious
[1:36:43] to make a confession like that hey you
[1:36:45] know we're going on dates you know you
[1:36:46] know something happened but you forgive
[1:36:48] me if you figure it
[1:36:50] there's no confession they're trying to
[1:36:52] ski that all over it right
[1:36:54] but what if i go and say lord i didn't
[1:36:56] mean
[1:36:57] to do it just that way and you help me i
[1:36:59] won't do it again
[1:37:01] he refused my sacrifice until i first
[1:37:03] and go and make it right with my wife
[1:37:06] and if when i come with her with the
[1:37:08] same irreverence
[1:37:10] and say oh old girl friend of mine old
[1:37:13] mother my children and old sweetheart
[1:37:14] you know old chumps for a long time say
[1:37:17] what if i put my arms around another
[1:37:18] woman what do you say about it oh would
[1:37:21] you forgive me
[1:37:22] don't marry and she looks you think what
[1:37:24] happened to my husband see the first
[1:37:26] thing she wouldn't know whether i was
[1:37:27] kidding or whether i wasn't and you
[1:37:30] don't go that way to make a confession
[1:37:32] to your fellow man or god you go with
[1:37:35] the depths of sincerity with godly
[1:37:38] sorrow of your sin first you must be
[1:37:40] sorry
[1:37:41] i must tell a sweetheart come here it
[1:37:43] may mean the rest of our married life
[1:37:45] the woman that i live with that's my
[1:37:46] sweetheart how i love you all these
[1:37:49] years but now you may leave me from this
[1:37:51] on but you may not stay with me you may
[1:37:53] not accept me but knowing that yet to
[1:37:55] make it right i've got to make it right
[1:37:57] then i've got to tell god the same way
[1:37:59] and tell both her and god with the
[1:38:01] sincerity that i'll never do it again by
[1:38:04] the grace of god and maybe my speech to
[1:38:06] her would convince her but my speech
[1:38:09] wouldn't convince god
[1:38:10] he looks in my heart
[1:38:12] he knows after all just a few more years
[1:38:15] with her if god permits and will be
[1:38:17] taken out of this world but with god is
[1:38:19] eternity so i must be deeply sincere
[1:38:22] with god
[1:38:23] then if i am sincere he will hear me
[1:38:26] and if i'm not sincere there is no need
[1:38:28] of me wasting god's time listening to me
[1:38:33] so you cannot go any more halfway
[1:38:36] you have to be deeply
[1:38:38] sincere
[1:38:40] hallelujah
[1:38:41] and then he shared this here i noticed
[1:38:44] the people making their confession has
[1:38:46] to come with deepness of sincerity he's
[1:38:48] talking about i believe it was in
[1:38:50] birmingham term new york a lack of
[1:38:52] sincerity seemed like and i wonder there
[1:38:54] was one man that was healed
[1:38:56] a one in particular speaking of the man
[1:38:58] had great affliction he was healed this
[1:39:00] night standing here and before we left
[1:39:03] five days the affliction was back on him
[1:39:05] again
[1:39:07] see because
[1:39:08] in the presence of the holy spirit it
[1:39:10] took that off of him just like they did
[1:39:13] the young woman a while ago here
[1:39:16] in the yard didn't pay something softly
[1:39:18] young man last night but it has to be a
[1:39:20] deep sincerity to know
[1:39:22] that the god here we go listen that the
[1:39:25] god that can take it away from you
[1:39:28] with the same anointing on you
[1:39:30] can keep it from you see then the holy
[1:39:34] spirit spoke to me one morning
[1:39:36] about daylight said get up on the
[1:39:38] platform and bring these people up here
[1:39:40] and make them confess everything they
[1:39:42] did before you pray for them
[1:39:45] unless the will repents
[1:39:47] it's got to perish
[1:39:49] praise the name of the lord
[1:39:55] so i'm going to close
[1:39:58] second corinthians 4 1-3 i'm going to
[1:40:01] read it amplified
[1:40:02] paul speaking considering ministry
[1:40:05] he said therefore since we do hold and
[1:40:07] engage this ministry
[1:40:09] by the mercy of god
[1:40:11] granting us favor benefits and
[1:40:13] opportunities we have renounced
[1:40:15] disgraceful ways
[1:40:17] secret thoughts feelings desires and
[1:40:19] underhandedness the method and arts that
[1:40:22] many hide through shame we refuse to
[1:40:25] deal craftily
[1:40:27] to practice trickery and cunning
[1:40:30] or to the adulterate
[1:40:32] to or handle this honestly the word of
[1:40:35] god and we state the truth openly
[1:40:37] clearly candidly so we commend ourselves
[1:40:41] in the sight and presence of god to
[1:40:43] every man's conscience
[1:40:44] so paul was saying we are not trying to
[1:40:47] be on the hand crafty manipulating the
[1:40:49] word manipulating people but we present
[1:40:51] the word in such openness
[1:40:53] that we are open to every man's
[1:40:55] conscience
[1:40:56] oh blessed me and even if our guts will
[1:40:58] be hidden
[1:41:00] or obscured or covered up with the veil
[1:41:02] that hinders the knowledge of god it is
[1:41:04] hidden to only to those who are
[1:41:06] perishing
[1:41:08] this is where i'm going to close
[1:41:10] god
[1:41:12] we realize that the badge of authority
[1:41:15] is not
[1:41:16] a name or denomination
[1:41:18] but it's the power
[1:41:20] the power of the resurrection of christ
[1:41:22] in each individual's life god miss
[1:41:24] people here this morning strive to enter
[1:41:26] that and if this tape should ever get
[1:41:28] out to the country where the people are
[1:41:30] out let them know that it wasn't set for
[1:41:32] malice because i'd be wrong myself that
[1:41:35] the church might be triumphant and
[1:41:36] realize this place
[1:41:38] now we pray father
[1:41:40] that you'll forgive some of our sins
[1:41:43] may this message you could begin to sing
[1:41:44] but anthony may this message sink deep
[1:41:46] into the hearts
[1:41:48] may the people with this church as this
[1:41:50] little tamina could know in the billion
[1:41:52] process of building a church
[1:41:54] may they never look to some beautiful
[1:41:55] something but just enough to shelter the
[1:41:57] people god may they never go back and
[1:41:58] look and say we belong to this big
[1:42:00] tabernacle we got a big dome on it god
[1:42:02] let it not be empty hull may never lose
[1:42:05] sight of the object of jesus christ may
[1:42:07] it be
[1:42:08] the one that fills the temple
[1:42:10] and then the power and fire of the holy
[1:42:12] ghost will fall on the altar upon them
[1:42:15] lastly
[1:42:16] i pray this morning
[1:42:18] that this world will lay so heavy on the
[1:42:20] altar of every heart
[1:42:22] they will never be able to get away from
[1:42:24] it
[1:42:25] they will come sane and sensibly to the
[1:42:27] gospel
[1:42:28] believe in the words
[1:42:30] and not open their heart to demon powers
[1:42:32] or sensations or jumping or
[1:42:34] manifestation in some physical form like
[1:42:36] that but a real true loving spirit of
[1:42:38] christ
[1:42:39] where he'll manifest himself in love and
[1:42:42] power granted lord heal the sickener
