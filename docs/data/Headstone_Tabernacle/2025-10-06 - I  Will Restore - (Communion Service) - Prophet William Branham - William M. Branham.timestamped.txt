[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] of us
[0:03] the blind.
[0:07] Oh,
[0:08] and there
[0:12] is a river.
[0:17] Oh, that never
[0:21] shall
[0:23] run dry.
[0:25] [Music]
[0:27] Oh, give him praise tonight. Hallelujah.
[0:31] Oh, thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord
[0:33] Jesus. Thank you for that river tonight.
[0:36] Thank you for that river that flows
[0:37] tonight. Flowing.
[0:40] Oh, hallelujah. From Christ's side
[0:43] tonight. Oh, glory to God. God bless
[0:47] you. And if you have your Bibles, you
[0:49] turn to Psalms chapter 89.
[0:52] Welcome once again
[0:55] to our communion service.
[0:58] And um Psalms 89, we're going to read
[1:01] from um
[1:04] 1-7
[1:08] says, "I will sing of the mercies of the
[1:10] Lord forever,
[1:12] and with my mouth will I make known thy
[1:14] faithfulness to all generations.
[1:18] For I have said, "Mercy shall be built
[1:20] up forever.
[1:22] Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in
[1:25] the very heavens. I have made a covenant
[1:28] with my chosen. I have sworn unto David
[1:31] my servant. Thy seed will I establish
[1:34] forever and build up my thy throne to
[1:38] all generations." Silla, the heavens
[1:42] shall praise thy wonders, O Lord, thy
[1:44] faithfulness also in the congregation of
[1:47] the saints. For who in the heaven can be
[1:50] compared unto the Lord? Or who among the
[1:52] sons of the mighty can be likened unto
[1:55] the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in
[1:59] the assembly of the saints and to be had
[2:02] in the reverence of all them that are
[2:05] about him. May God add blessing to the
[2:08] reading of his word.

[12:10] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[12:11] Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Praise God. But
[12:15] God bless you. I think we're ready to
[12:18] switch over the order of the service
[12:19] now. Amen. And we have a tape that we
[12:22] like to play for you. Says, "I will
[12:24] restore." Amen. So, as you get ready to
[12:26] put it on, may the Lord richly bless you
[12:29] as we get into it this evening. You say
[12:31] amen to the word. Write the anointing.
[12:33] Praise God. There's something in store
[12:34] for you tonight. Amen. God promise to
[12:37] restore. This is the uh season for it
[12:39] now. So, God bless you as we hook in to
[12:42] the word. May God bless you. Amen. Oh,
[12:46] you can have your seats briefly. Amen.
[12:47] Praise God.
[13:10] Amen.
[13:26] I trust if you'll bear with me, I
[13:29] express my thoughts on scripture.
[13:32] I want to read out the book of Joel,
[13:36] the first chapter of verse and the
[13:38] second chapter of verse, the fourth and
[13:40] the Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stand for the reading
[13:44] of the word now. Amen. As he goes into
[13:46] Joel, God bless you.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; In Joel the first chapter, it says,
[13:51] "That which the Palmer worm has left as
[13:56] the locust eat." That which the locust
[13:59] has left as the uh I'm part. I'm reading
[14:04] it wrong.
[14:06] That which the palm worm has left has
[14:09] the locust eating. And that which the
[14:12] locust has left, the tanker worm has
[14:15] eaten. And that which the I mean the
[14:18] caterpillar has eaten that which the
[14:19] caterpillar has left as the tanker worm
[14:21] has eaten as the caterpillar. Now I'm
[14:24] all mixed up again. But
[14:27] standing here with teard and shaking.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll read it again.
[14:35] That which the palmer worm has left as
[14:38] the locust eating. And that which the
[14:41] locust has left as the cankerorm eating.
[14:45] That which the tank canorm has left as
[14:47] the caterpillar.
[14:51] And then over in Joel 2:25,
[14:54] I will restore unto you. Lord,
[15:02] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Our precious Lord
[15:09] as a bunch of pilgrims and strangers,
[15:14] we humbly bow in your presence.
[15:18] Lord,
[15:19] &gt;&gt; first of all to ask you to forgive us
[15:22] for all of our sasses.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and to say within ourselves
[15:28] that we are unworthy
[15:31] of any blessing that you should give to
[15:33] us.
[15:36] And we have come this morning as a group
[15:39] of people
[15:40] under the old oak tree as it was to sit
[15:44] around for a little time of fellowship.
[15:48] And I pray be God to be merciful to on
[15:51] us and to give unto us that which we
[15:55] have need of.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; May the great Holy Spirit now come among
[16:01] us and come upon each of us and give us
[16:07] the food from the Bible that we have
[16:10] need of.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Bless this group of men.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Bless this gathering today. Bless the
[16:18] revival
[16:20] &gt;&gt; and the Christian hear
[16:23] and for everything that's been done or
[16:25] said during this meeting. And we pray
[16:28] that in the end we'll hear those
[16:30] wonderful words. It was well done. My
[16:33] goodness.
[16:35] Enter into the joy of the Lord. We ask
[16:39] in Jesus name. Amen.
[16:44] Now may the Lord add his blessing to his
[16:47] word.
[16:57] subject that I would just like to
[16:59] briefly say because I know we got lots
[17:02] of things to do as tenant based team.
[17:07] You know, there's
[17:09] none of us just alike.
[17:12] If we should all go up this morning and
[17:14] they give us a fingerprint, we'd find
[17:17] out there's no two fingerprints exactly
[17:19] alike.
[17:21] That's known.
[17:23] They claim there's no two people got
[17:26] noses just exactly aligned.
[17:29] We're so different
[17:32] one to the other and in many makeup.
[17:35] But we can certainly agree that we're
[17:38] all human.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; And in our religious beliefs, we find
[17:45] the same thing.
[17:48] We find that some believed one thing and
[17:50] some another. But I've always tried to
[17:53] make it a policy
[17:56] to never try to cross up anybody
[18:00] to do anything wrong.
[18:03] I when I come out of the Baptist church,
[18:06] I haven't went across the country
[18:08] telling what a bad bunch of people the
[18:10] Baptists are. I go across the country
[18:13] telling what a fine bunch of people the
[18:15] Baptists are.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Because they are.
[18:19] I might not agree with them just on
[18:21] everything, but I certainly would take
[18:24] one of them before I would take an
[18:26] unbeliever, before I would take a
[18:28] communist.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; And as long as they are mentioning the
[18:32] name of the Lord, though I wouldn't
[18:33] believe with them,
[18:35] &gt;&gt; I certainly we might not believe on
[18:37] every principle, but we believe on
[18:39] Christ.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the main thing.
[18:45] I wouldn't need to speak evil of the
[18:48] Baptist or the persecution are not even
[18:51] to the Catholics because there's
[18:54] Catholic people who I believe are saved.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; God has so made it so simple to us that
[19:00] he that believeth
[19:04] and there's many other I wouldn't
[19:06] believe the system of the Catholic
[19:08] Church but I believe in the Catholic
[19:10] people.
[19:12] I don't believe in the system of the
[19:14] maybe the Baptist or Presbyterian or
[19:17] even the Pentecostal sometimes, but I
[19:20] believe in their people
[19:22] &gt;&gt; because they're my brothers in church.
[19:27] Now, in our short message, I had just
[19:31] the first time I've ever tried to write
[19:34] down something, just a point that I
[19:36] wanted to make and come to because not
[19:41] only to preach, I didn't come to preach.
[19:43] I just come to speak to you.
[19:46] And um
[19:48] I preached by inspiration, authority.
[19:52] But in speaking like this, I just want
[19:53] to talk to you.
[19:55] But there's four great danger that I
[19:58] want to mention.
[20:01] And that is Joel the prophet
[20:04] who was God's eagle who climbed up into
[20:07] the sphere of God and saw the day
[20:10] coming.
[20:13] Peter quoted him on the day of Pentecost
[20:16] in Joel 2:38.
[20:20] He said, "This is that which is spoken
[20:22] by the prophet Joy."
[20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; And Joel saw that coming.
[20:30] And if Joel's prophecy was so accurate
[20:33] that it saw Pentecost
[20:36] many hundred years before it ever
[20:38] happened,
[20:40] then surely the prophecy that he has
[20:43] given to this day, we could say would be
[20:45] accurate.
[20:47] But the thing I want to speak on is
[20:49] this. the four great destroyers.
[20:54] First it was the
[20:58] the
[20:59] Palmer worms
[21:01] and the next was the locust
[21:04] and the next was the tanker worms and
[21:07] the next was the caterpillar.
[21:11] Then were destroyers
[21:14] and what they were destroying was the
[21:17] heritage of God.
[21:20] the vine.
[21:24] And if you will check closely on your
[21:28] insects,
[21:31] those three
[21:33] or those four insects are the same
[21:37] insect
[21:38] in a different form.
[21:42] the caterpillar
[21:45] and the uh locust,
[21:48] the canker worm in the I mean the mixed
[21:51] up. The first was the Palmer worm and
[21:56] then the locust
[21:58] and then the canker worm and the
[22:01] caterpillar. We are told that that is
[22:04] the same insect
[22:07] and just a different form coming down.
[22:11] Now if Pentecost
[22:15] was God's vine,
[22:18] which was the new vine that had grown
[22:22] up, then these four destroyers
[22:28] have been the one that eat the vine
[22:30] down.
[22:33] Now let's find out what Pentecost had
[22:38] and find out what we got lacking.
[22:41] Then we ought to find out what the
[22:43] destroyers are, who they are. Amen.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Or what city.
[22:49] Now the first thing that Pentecost
[22:53] produced was brotherly love. That's
[22:56] right. Amen.
[22:58] That's right.
[23:00] It tore down the middle wall of the
[23:03] teachings and made a brotherhood
[23:07] to such a way that they had everything
[23:09] in common.
[23:11] In the Bible days,
[23:14] a brotherhood.
[23:16] Paul spoke of this brotherhood
[23:20] and he gave all the gifts of the
[23:22] Pentecostal church
[23:25] and then said in first Corin or
[23:28] Corinthians 13
[23:31] that though I speak with tongue as men
[23:35] and angels and have not this love which
[23:38] brings the brotherhood, I am nothing.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[23:44] And though I have the knowledge to
[23:48] understand all the mysteries of God, I
[23:52] am still nothing without love. The love
[23:55] of the brethren.
[23:58] Jesus said this for all men know that
[24:01] you're my disciples.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; When you have love one for the other.
[24:08] Pentecost had that. I'm speaking
[24:12] Pentecost, meaning the first group of
[24:14] the apostles and the disciples. They had
[24:18] that brotherly love.
[24:20] They wasn't greedy.
[24:23] They sold everything they had for the
[24:25] furthering of the church.
[24:29] They were so together to even when one
[24:33] heard the other one died, he said, "Let
[24:34] us go and die with him." such a deal.
[24:41] Now
[24:43] Jesus spoke of this and said that Paul
[24:47] and other said let brotherly love
[24:49] continue
[24:50] that was in the first church.
[24:54] But something taking place
[24:58] and there was a fellow come in by a name
[25:02] of a polymer worm.
[25:05] And when you begin to eat on that vine
[25:08] of brotherly love, he cuts the very sack
[25:12] line of it.
[25:15] Because it don't make any difference how
[25:18] smart we are, how much we think we know,
[25:21] or how much we want to be different from
[25:24] somebody else.
[25:27] As long as that brotherly feeling isn't
[25:31] among us, we are fighting a lossy
[25:34] battle. That's right. That's right.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; We can't win. There's no way for us to
[25:47] win.
[25:49] And now in the Pentecostal church of
[25:52] today comparing the two and what's
[25:55] happened
[25:57] now if you'll notice the routine of the
[26:00] gift.
[26:02] The first is the gift of wisdom. Thank
[26:05] you.
[26:07] The first is the gift of wisdom.
[26:12] That is the best gift of the group.
[26:17] And if we don't have wisdom,
[26:20] we won't know how to use knowledge
[26:25] &gt;&gt; is the second gift.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; And if we can't use the second gift
[26:31] without wisdom, how are we going to use
[26:34] the last gift interpretation
[26:39] or next to the last speaking in tongues?
[26:45] Our zeal has eat up our wisdom and our
[26:49] zeal for our denomination
[26:53] and our enthusiasm
[26:55] has eat up the wisdom
[26:59] of the vine brotherly love.
[27:03] It's all right. And you brethren, the
[27:05] reason I said for you to come this
[27:07] morning, I want to speak to ministers.
[27:11] It's all right to have denominations.
[27:14] There's nothing against that.
[27:17] But when denomination isolates itself
[27:21] and separates his fellowship from his
[27:24] brethren, that old Palmer worm has eated
[27:28] out of it to begin with. That's right.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; When we get to a place, if you want to
[27:36] differ with a man, why is man that I
[27:39] know
[27:40] that I could see eye to eye with as
[27:43] close to scriptures as anybody in the
[27:45] world is brother Moore sitting here.
[27:49] But oh, do we
[27:51] times we're a million miles apart.
[27:57] But did that ever touch us?
[28:00] No.
[28:02] Here he is with a little wide over
[28:04] yonder anchoring the phone so much that
[28:07] she's got almost a nervous breakdown.
[28:09] Call last night crying on the phone.
[28:13] And he loves me well enough. Not because
[28:15] he gets a penny of money. No sir. But he
[28:19] flies on an old rocking plane and
[28:21] everything else to get over here to be
[28:23] with me a little bit.
[28:28] I don't believe the night would ever
[28:30] lead to the dark or the rain would ever
[28:33] fall too hard. But what I climb and
[28:35] crawl through the jungles to get to me.
[28:38] Hallelujah. It's a love.
[28:41] Yet we wouldn't agree on scriptures by
[28:43] 100 miles on millenniums and so forth
[28:46] like that on security of the believer.
[28:51] But that don't make it.
[28:55] I'm even he even in our different I am
[28:59] elected associate attri
[29:06] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that the power room hasn't
[29:08] touched the guest
[29:14] &gt;&gt; now I'm just saying that for an example
[29:20] and if we could do that between two
[29:23] understand. Why can't every brother do
[29:26] it?
[29:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; I might have a right to say things
[29:31] against the church. I went to his church
[29:34] here not long ago
[29:36] and I thought he never would invite me
[29:38] back.
[29:40] Well, I come to find out that godly
[29:43] bunch of little saintly women he had
[29:45] there was bobbing off their hair and
[29:47] wearing lipstick. I tore the thing
[29:49] apart.
[29:55] But I thought he wouldn't ask me back.
[30:00] But you know what? There was such an
[30:03] anointing of the Holy Spirit around the
[30:05] vine that that old Palmer worm couldn't
[30:08] touch it.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; You know there's electric fence right
[30:16] that Palmer worm can't get over that
[30:18] fence. Amen.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; That shock of the Holy Spirit of love.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; You're going to kill him every time,
[30:25] brother.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; And if we need fences to build, it ought
[30:32] to be denominational fences. It ought to
[30:35] be love fences that keep
[30:40] the power.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; For he is the devil's number one
[30:48] destroyer.
[30:50] I don't care what a man believes.
[30:54] Whatever he believes now, he's got a
[30:55] right to come right back and tell me he
[30:57] don't believe little things that I
[30:59] believe. I got a right to say little
[31:01] things that he doesn't believe in this
[31:02] church, the Methodist, the Baptist, the
[31:04] Presbyterian, even to the Pentecostal.
[31:08] See, whatever. I'm with the Pentecostal
[31:11] people. I am Pentecost. I don't belong
[31:14] to the Pentecostal denomination because
[31:16] Pentecost is not a denomination.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Experience
[31:22] heard that Lutheran say a while ago
[31:25] and I will shut the Baptist sitting over
[31:27] there coming down.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; I believe there's another Baptist
[31:30] looking at me there at the check or was
[31:33] see
[31:35] it is an experience. That's right.
[31:39] [Applause]
[31:41] And the trouble is we let these insects
[31:44] get in and tear us the pieces.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; And that is the number one killer.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; That's what's eating in our Pentecostal
[31:55] experiences today.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Now the next great
[32:03] thing come up was the locust
[32:08] and
[32:09] He was the one who was to destroy in
[32:12] unity
[32:13] of the believers.
[32:16] In the Bible
[32:18] there was in Pentecost there was a
[32:21] unity.
[32:24] And these people were with one heart and
[32:28] with one accord.
[32:32] And Paul said, I believe in Romans the
[32:36] 7th chapter, that there was nothing to
[32:40] separate us from the 8th chapter of
[32:43] Romans of the love of God that's in
[32:46] Christ Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; There was nothing.
[32:53] I've never expressed this before the
[32:55] street Pentecostal people or anyone
[33:00] but seeing the tremendous strain that's
[33:03] been on me.
[33:05] That's why I come to do it this morning.
[33:09] It's the mightiest church on the face of
[33:11] the earth.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; And it is the church.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; There's only one church.
[33:21] Many of them are still branded badges,
[33:24] Presbyterians.
[33:26] But I might not look like at this point,
[33:29] but I used to herd a few cattle.
[33:32] And up there in Colorado, where we graze
[33:35] on the repol forest and and bring the
[33:38] cattle down on the trouble river
[33:40] association, her association grazes the
[33:43] has the ranch down on the trouble river.
[33:47] at roundup time at the spring when we
[33:50] brought the cattle up to put them on
[33:51] there many times as I sat there with my
[33:53] leg across the horn of the saddle watch
[33:56] the ranger count those cattle as they
[33:58] went through
[34:00] and I was amazed to look some of them
[34:03] had the lazy cave brand on them some of
[34:06] them had the diamond bars brand on them
[34:09] ours was a tripod
[34:12] and others are different brands the
[34:14] rangers the brand didn't make much
[34:17] difference.
[34:20] But everyone that passed through that
[34:22] gate will be a reminister.
[34:25] That's why I think it'll be at the day
[34:27] of the judgment.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; It won't be whether you're a Methodist
[34:32] or Baptist or Presbyterian, but what
[34:35] brands you got on you,
[34:37] &gt;&gt; but it'll be a bornagain experience
[34:40] doing.
[34:44] So, not only amongst the Pentecostal
[34:46] denominations, but all denominations,
[34:49] this great Palmer worm has broke down
[34:53] brotherhood. It did it with the
[34:55] Lutheran. It did it with the Baptist. It
[34:57] did it with the Presbyterians. It did it
[34:59] with the Nazarines. It did it with the
[35:01] Pentecostals.
[35:03] It's always been that old worm in there
[35:06] to make them isolate themselves. God,
[35:09] &gt;&gt; we got it. You ain't got nothing.
[35:12] My
[35:13] &gt;&gt; what a pin
[35:16] &gt;&gt; reasonably at a meeting
[35:18] where a a Lutheran group of people, a
[35:22] dean of a college had brother Moore and
[35:25] I there and he so differed with me. But
[35:29] what got him was in the supernatural
[35:33] and he called me out.
[35:36] to have dinner with him and they would
[35:38] sit there and send his drinks as
[35:40] breakfast.
[35:43] And then when we got through eating and
[35:46] was explaining to him, he wanted to know
[35:48] what we Lutherans have.
[35:52] And I said, "Well, do you say he said to
[35:56] me, "Do we Luther have anything?"
[36:00] I said, "Sure."
[36:02] He has crying.
[36:05] I said, "I'll make it to you in a
[36:06] parable."
[36:09] A man once planted a seed of corn.
[36:14] And he went out in a few days and he
[36:16] looked and there were little two little
[36:18] sprouts sticking up like this. And the
[36:21] man be to praise God for a field of
[36:23] corn.
[36:26] I said, "Did he have corn?"
[36:29] He looked at me said, "Well,
[36:33] perhaps in a sense he had corn." that he
[36:35] has corn potentially.
[36:40] Bind by that corn mature and after a
[36:43] while it becomes a tonsle.
[36:47] Now I said the first two leaves are
[36:48] eluded
[36:51] first reformation.
[36:53] And after a while along come the telles
[36:56] that also look so pretty. They looked
[36:59] back down to the leaf and said I ain't
[37:01] got nothing to do with you.
[37:04] I'm a pretty console and you aren't
[37:07] nothing but just an old green leaf.
[37:12] But if the truth was known,
[37:15] the very life that was in the leaf is
[37:18] made to
[37:22] &gt;&gt; and it has to have the leaf to drop its
[37:24] pollen
[37:26] to further on towards maturity.
[37:30] After a while, the ear comes
[37:33] and grains on it. The Pentecostal
[37:36] restoration of the gift
[37:39] like the one that went in the ground,
[37:41] the return of the power of God in
[37:43] fullness, showing Christ alive
[37:46] at Pentecost to the gifts and
[37:48] manifestations of the first church. But
[37:51] you know when this ear corn come on, he
[37:54] looked back to that thought and said,
[37:55] "You ain't got nothing.
[38:04] If you
[38:06] &gt;&gt; and you old dead losing leaves down
[38:08] there, there's nothing to you.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; But brothers,
[38:14] remember
[38:15] the life that's in the grain come out
[38:17] the leaf also.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; It's nothing but a corn further mature.
[38:25] Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; But don't laugh at the Lutheran.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's a further maturing of the
[38:36] year.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; But now the thing about this, we've had
[38:41] that in our minds
[38:43] until it has created another thing. And
[38:47] we got fungus growing out all over the
[38:49] years.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; You know what fungus is?
[38:57] Well, you know what fungus is what
[38:59] brains?
[39:01] Is something wrong?
[39:05] Something's wrong with the tree that has
[39:07] fungus on it. It's got a disease in it.
[39:10] And Pentecost has got a disease.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; It's got a lot of fungus growing on.
[39:19] That's right. In in all of our churches
[39:22] got fungus growing on
[39:26] we've got the old
[39:29] Palmer one come along with his stinger
[39:32] break down brotherhood break down unity
[39:35] among us.
[39:38] Paul said in the Bible that he wanted us
[39:42] to all speak the same thing.
[39:46] He wanted us all to be in unity. I got a
[39:49] little note right here. I'll go to uh
[39:53] read on it
[39:56] all the operation of the gift and so
[39:58] forth.
[40:00] And in unity they stood as one great big
[40:05] union church.
[40:10] But we find out that that church stayed
[40:14] that way with brotherhood and they love
[40:17] not their lives unto death. They went on
[40:21] in martyrdom. Many of you men here who
[40:24] are scholars, you've read uh the well
[40:29] the early ages of the church and books
[40:32] like pop book of martyrs and so forth
[40:34] and many other church uh church history
[40:39] and how they stuck together.
[40:43] Nothing could separate them. Then during
[40:47] this dark age,
[40:49] they come forth with an organization,
[40:52] they come forth with a man-made policy.
[40:56] Yeah. The locusts begin to fly in. The
[41:01] same devil that broke up brotherhood is
[41:04] trying to break the unity of man. And
[41:06] they made their first organization and
[41:08] that was the Catholic Church.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; God's church never was organized into
[41:13] Catholicism. That's right. And then it
[41:16] was a forces
[41:18] that you had to do it or they pulled
[41:22] them apart with pops. They burn them.
[41:24] They fed them the lines. They done
[41:25] everything
[41:27] and they forced in a false unity.
[41:32] [Applause]
[41:34] The locust begin to stain
[41:37] and it's too bad
[41:39] after the caterpillar has got into the
[41:42] Pentecostal church and broke up the
[41:44] brotherhood.
[41:45] Then the locust comes around add to that
[41:48] and begins to state us to organize
[41:52] different little groups to break up our
[41:54] unity.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; That's one of the destroyers.
[42:01] If the old general counsel
[42:05] when the Pentecostal move was first
[42:07] brought in, is in by speaking with
[42:11] tongues the bottom of the gift, bring it
[42:14] up. If they would have just stayed put
[42:19] and would have never organized
[42:21] and just let it be a Pentecostal
[42:24] fellowship
[42:25] &gt;&gt; in the sin of any organization, we'd
[42:28] have been a million times better off
[42:32] and let us experience
[42:35] &gt;&gt; and not a denomination.
[42:38] Now remember, I'm stating myself. I'm
[42:40] not against the denomination. It has to
[42:43] be that way or God's word would have
[42:45] said it would be that way.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; If these caterpillars and thugs are
[42:49] going to eat the church, they're going
[42:51] to eat it.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. God said so, that's just
[42:55] as plain as he said he pour out his
[42:57] spirit.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; What God says for one thing, whether
[43:01] it's good or evil, it's going to be just
[43:02] that way.
[43:05] But I'm just I'm just bringing out
[43:07] something to your view so you can see.
[43:12] Now the caterpillar
[43:14] uh begin to eat or the locust rather and
[43:18] he broke up against unity and they
[43:22] organized the first church
[43:25] leader organizing second and all down to
[43:29] the angels constantly one organization.
[43:32] And when you do, you tear down the very
[43:35] principle
[43:38] &gt;&gt; of brotherhood.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Brethren, to my opinion,
[43:46] if we are mentally right, we don't weep
[43:49] God's Bible and look out upon the thing
[43:51] and you see that it's that way.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We are not designed.
[43:58] All one body we
[44:01] &gt;&gt; one in hope and doctrine, one in
[44:04] charity.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do about
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Praise
[44:17] God. Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just raise your hands and give him
[44:21] praise this evening. Thank you, Lord.
[44:23] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father.
[44:26] Just give him praise. as we bless your
[44:27] name Lord. Oh, I shall restore, sayeth
[44:31] the Lord. Restore the brotherhood.
[44:32] Restore faith. Hallelujah. Restore love.
[44:36] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be
[44:39] your wonderful name. Blessed be the name
[44:41] of the Lord. Thank you for your word,
[44:43] Lord. Thank you, Lord God. We bless you.
[44:46] We praise you. We worship you this
[44:48] evening, Father.
[44:50] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[44:52] Thank you, Father. Amen. Praise you. How
[44:55] many appreciate the message this
[44:57] evening? Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[44:59] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I will
[45:02] restore, sayeth the Lord. Amen. God
[45:05] bless you. Amen. Let's just turn to our
[45:07] Bibles as we switch over now to the
[45:09] Lord's Supper.
[45:12] Amen. We want to go go to 1 Corinthians
[45:15] chapter 11
[45:17] 23-32.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:27] Praise the Lord. Heavenly Father, we
[45:29] approach your word at this time. Father,
[45:31] we pray that you'd blessed and
[45:33] sanctified and inspired to our hearts as
[45:35] we would read now in Jesus name with
[45:37] thanksgiving. Amen and amen.
[45:41] Praise God.
[45:43] Verse 23. For I have received of the
[45:47] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[45:50] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[45:53] in which he was betrayed, took bread.
[45:57] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[46:00] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my word
[46:04] body which is broken for you. This do in
[46:08] remembrance of me."
[46:11] After the same manner also he took the
[46:13] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[46:17] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[46:20] This do ye as often as you drink it in
[46:23] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[46:26] eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
[46:29] show the Lord's death till he comes.
[46:33] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[46:36] and drink this cup of the Lord
[46:38] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[46:41] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[46:44] examine himself. And so let him eat of
[46:47] that bread and drink of that cup. For he
[46:50] that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily
[46:53] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[46:55] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[47:00] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[47:02] among you and many sleep. For if we
[47:05] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[47:08] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[47:11] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[47:14] be condemned with the world. Let's just
[47:17] bow our heads and close our eyes this
[47:19] evening.
[47:22] Heavenly Father, we pause at this time,
[47:25] Lord, to observe the ordinance of uh the
[47:29] Lord's supper and feet washing. Father,
[47:32] Lord, Father, we pray that you would
[47:34] bless the articles that have been prepar
[47:36] prepared, the bread and wine
[47:40] representing the body and blood of our
[47:41] Lord Jesus Christ. Father, Lord, you
[47:44] said to do this, Lord, till you come,
[47:46] Father. And Lord, in obedience, we
[47:49] observe this ordinance this evening.
[47:51] Father,
[47:52] bless your people, Lord, as we would
[47:54] come this evening to partake of the
[47:56] bread and wine and to wash one another's
[47:59] feet. Lord, may we come with humility.
[48:02] May we come with reverence and respect
[48:04] and love in our hearts for the brothers,
[48:07] the brotherhood. Father, Lord, Lord, may
[48:10] you fill and refill your people, Father.
[48:13] May you heal the sick and afflicted,
[48:15] Father. Lord, even as we partake of it,
[48:18] Lord, may your presence come down and
[48:20] anoint and inspire your people, Father,
[48:22] for the journey that lies ahead. Lord,
[48:25] we commit everything now into your
[48:26] hands. Bless your people, Lord, as we
[48:28] fellowship and partake around it your
[48:30] table this evening in Jesus name with
[48:33] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Keep your
[48:36] heads bowed as we want to observe a
[48:38] moment of silence where you would pray
[48:40] for the ministry and the ministry would
[48:42] pray for you at this time.
[49:04] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. You
[49:06] may be seated as the deacons and elders
[49:09] are ready to serve. Amen. God richly
[49:12] bless you. Brothers get put on the
[49:14] music. Hallelujah.
