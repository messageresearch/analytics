teacher of sir [Music] around us [Music] bye-bye night Jesus I'll carry you the Lord I have a praise so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles can be turned to just one portion of Scripture reading from scene Matthew chapter 2 and reading from verse 1 thank you brother Anthony thank you musicians Matthew chapter 2 reading from verse 1 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold they came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the King had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto Him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of Judah at thou art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that's a rule my people Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when he had found and when he have found him bring me word again that I may come and wish of him also when they had heard the King they departed and lo the star which we saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they will come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worship him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way and when they were departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring the word for Herod will seek a young child to destroy him and when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and there was and was they until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet seeing out of Egypt have I called my son then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts there are from two years all and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so I have a title this morning for Christmas encouragement or Christmas message and my title is we have seen his star we have seen his star and for subject the voice of the sign and an inspiration the identification of the true worshipers you know and we know from the message and we know through studying Scripture but the Branham brought it out so many times that December the 25th is not the day that Jesus would have been born and that date would have evolved from mixture of trying to mix Romanism with Christianity and paganism but the reality is as brother Branham said he said whenever people are speaking about Christmas the real Christians have a responsibility to bring up the truth of the birth of Jesus Christ because if Christ was not born there would be no salvation and if Christ was not born there would be no redemption and if Christ was not born there would be no restoration and if Christ was not born there would be no deliverance and if if Christ was not born there would be no healing so the celebration of the birth of Christ is something that we ought to celebrate every day it is not just in December it is not on a certainty it is a celebration because it is connected directly so who we are because if he did not come he could not have died if he did not come he could not have walked on the water and God rich in His grace and mercy promised a king he promised a governor he promised a ruler and he brought a baby so when the devil is looking for a king and looking for a governor and looking for a chariot and looking for a horse here comes a baby and God slips a baby right under the devil's nose and that and that baby is born right there in a manger can the church see men so I greet you this morning and on behalf of brother over than the ministry we want to wish you a blessed or Merry Christmas and I want to quote the Prophet in a message says we would see Jesus you say god bless you not exactly a Merry Christmas but God's blessings of Christmas be upon you Meter Christ of Calvary hide you in himself blanket you so wrap you and in strode you in his wood till his wood will be made flesh in you is my prayer and that is our prayer that is our desire for every believer here this morning can the church say man so we are going to be in a word this morning I'm excited about what is happening and I'm so happy to see the believers who made it out here today you know christmas is a time is a special time Christmas means anonymously a number of things it means a time for family it means a time for connecting it means a time for for for ham a time for for Turkey a time for for different people it means it means the friending the time the share gifts the time to connect with friends or time to break diets it's a time it's a time of a lot of different things and you always say we have to always remember the real reason for the season and as brother Branham would speak about this he would speak to the church he said I can tell you how to raise your children you know but Christmas is not about Santa Claus he said if you lie to them about Santa Claus one natal one no one else you lied about so tell them the truth the real truth about Christmas that and it's not about the gifts and it's not about the standard Claus but there was a gift because God so loved the world and He gave His only begotten Son and and that I call the first great gift and by the manaman preaching would say but there's another gift it's it's a gift of the Holy Ghost that's that's the real gift that he wanted to give his people and he would always say the best Christmas gift you could ever get is that eternal life the gift of the Holy Ghost and he would preach to the people that when he have a Christmas message that my desire for you is if I could give it to you myself I would but he is the giver of the gift and he is still giving the gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire and his promise is just as real as it was when he was here a can - amen oh so we gonna talk about Jesus this morning is that's okay is that okay with you for a few minutes that talk about Jesus because we have seen his star and because we have seen his star we have come to worship up the star woke us up this morning the stock hoard our attention and brother branham said that that stock expressed a message because the star itself was a signer this now was not the endgame the star was pointing to something that was happening this towers a prophetic message the star had a voice the star raised questions can the church here and I'm already leaving my notes this morning where that's all right for 400 years there was no spiritual move that's what the Prophet said prophecy had hung over a cheering of Israel hung over the Jews the last prophet Malachi had already left the scene and he he took me whole I will send you Elijah before the Great and dreadful to him all those prophecies were overing and for 400 years there was silence but when the Branham taught us and scripture tells us God to do nothing in the spiritual unless there's a sign so before is a spiritual happening they has got to be a sign and God had to place the sign with enough notice because there were some Gentiles who had to see the silent and they had to ask questions but the Branham said these were wise men these were studied men these were spiritual men you see I can imagine and brother Branham would paint a picture that every day every time they will get up into the tower and they would look out to the stars but the Brenham said these men you or every star meant you know whatever east I was connected to didn't know every movement meant they understood what everything was a powder but all of a sudden one there they saw something they never saw before they saw something they could not explain and but the problem said maybe they went to their master he said when you go back to the Book of Daniel when Daniel was here he was their master over in Babylonian because all the sages and the wise men would come and discuss the Stars and disgusto ever and discuss science and discuss and you see there's nothing we have to explain this sign this sign is a different kind of sign we have seen stars we have seen constellations we have seen things before but this one is different and it got them so curious it got them so excited but the brown said they may have look to their own scriptures and found nothing but the Branham said maybe they went back to the Book of Daniel and phone with Daniel wrote about a stone cut out without the hands of man and he started to connect the pieces theologians describe these men as the kingmakers because for centuries it was the Magi and the sages and the wise men that would confer together to anoint kings thousands of years ago so when her father was dying and leaving his throne to his son or one of his sons the wise men would be summoned to look at the Stars and look at the signs and let the King know that's the right Sun and when the King passed on they were coming and knowing who was gonna replace the King so God had some Gentiles who were the problem said they were also believers because they believed in one God but their hearts were pricked to say we have seen something and we have to investigate but the man said it took about two years two years of cold two years of rugged Road and two years of camels and didn't give up but they Brandon said that's how the character of the Christian is more little to the hardship it wasn't a one-week journey it wasn't a drive to church on Sunday morning it was two years two years of pushing two years of pressing two years of fighting I'm gonna Brandon said under way to Bethlehem they had to pass through Jerusalem the city that was the spiritual city holy Jerusalem and when they got there when the terrans they came in a revival because they knew they were near to what they were looking for they came excited he came excited where is he where is the king must is Messiah Mia no where are all the miracles where's the king of kings oh and amid so much noise that the officers of the day brought these men in front of Herod and the Bible said Herod was troubled and all of Jerusalem not part of Jerusalem all of Jerusalem was troubled and then Herod : ministers meeting he said brother's ministers scribes tell me what it says about the Christ and the Bible says they found where it was written so it was not that they didn't have it it was not that they didn't know it but they had forgotten about it because they were caught up in the rituals or they were caught up in the traditions up But Here Come tree Manor who were not from their City not from their town not from their church not from their establishment but they came at the desire because God let them see this time Oh hallelujah hallelujah and Herod and it's so beautiful because you see the clear this difference between what a man says with his mouth and what he says with his heart he said when you find him bring back word to me because I'm also a worship because I want to worship him too and these wise men left feeling that that was the right thing to do but we read the scripture God had to give them a dream to let them know pass the other way don't pass through D by pass don't pass back to Jerusalem take the other Road and and head back home with your rejoicing because Cara's motive is not right can the church Seaman and we're gonna get to it later in the message but our worship is based on a sign the start was a sign it was pointing to the Messiah a prophet is a sign because the Prophet is not to identify himself and brother Branham taught us that in the right hand of God he plays seven stars and these stars were to attract the people in their age and in their time to see that there was Messiah to reveal word on the earth at that time so Paul he was a stop and those who saw the staff had to follow the voice of the sign to see what the message was Paul did not point people to himself but he was pointed to Jesus and he said if an angel come down from heaven and preach any other gospel let him be accursed but I'm pointing you to Jesus I'm pointing you to the Messiah I'm pointing you to the King of Kings on and Paul was a star in the right hand of God anybody in the house this morning anybody in the house this morning we're gonna get to the real meaning of Christmas we're gonna get to the real meaning of what is this all about but we have seen his staff that is what has us excited of we have seen his table God Himself please a star to catch our attention but some of us has been two years up we've been on the journey the sum has been 40 years up on the journey but we will see the Lord's Christ up we will see Messiah we will see the King of Kings up we will see that great governor we will see it we shall see the king oh we are walking in the light this morning or you may be seated Oh hallelujah so I'm bringing some types of spawning those wise men they saw a natural star but we didn't see that stuff we were not there when they saw what this saw but we have also seen a star because the messengers of the seven churches but the Branham said they asked us in the right hand of God and in our team we have had a star in our time we have had a star in our generation we have had a star and that star has been pointing at the Messiah that star has been pointing to the revealed Word we have seen his star Oh hallelujah and we are walking in that light we are walking in the light of that star this morning we are walking in the light of that message you may be seated I want to make sure this gets home this morning when that star appear to the wise men that's our seeing something that's our seeing a king is coming a king is coming a king is coming a king is coming Messiah is coming the king of kings is coming redemption is coming deliverance is coming the kingdom is coming power is coming listen whatever the Magi is had whatever they had over there they realize that that sign spoke of something more more than they had before more than they knew before more than the experience before because if what they had was enough they didn't need to follow the stop but when they saw that shine they recognize there's more there's more to waking up in the morning I'm going to work there's more than waking up and baking a ham there's more than bacon turkey Messiah is on the earth the whole creation the whole of nature is groaning for deliverance Oh hallelujah somebody help me please just morning you may be seated these wise men whatever 19 Kings before these wise men whatever anointed leaders before but what she turned them as there was never a king like this king there was never there was never a king like this king there was never a lord like this Lord somebody preached back to me anybody in the house this morning hallelujah Oh hallelujah whoo hallelujah hallelujah keep on your spiritual hat this morning [Applause] and when they came and they saw a young child they testified not just with words but he they brought a gift to identify that they had a revelation of what the star was pointing to they brought gold to identify his kingship their fourth frankincense to identify his priesthood and they brought mother to identify that he was the sacrifice and these men who were not from Jerusalem they were not from the tribe of Levites they were not from the tribe of Israel but God to minister to them and find them where they were and give them a deeper revelation that Messiah was on the earth tub Hera didn't know it the priests didn't know it the minister's didn't know it the whole of Jerusalem the Bible says they were all trouble but not these men what was their testimony they didn't even see a miracle did you saw the stuff they didn't see a sign or a wonder did you saw the star and that star give them enough feet to believe the impossible to believe that Messiah could be on the earth now can the church say Amen oh we're talking about Jesus this morning I'm not gonna be too long with you but ride with me for a few minutes this morning but the Branham and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed said he is four talking about Jesus is the principal theme of the Bible he was in the prophets he was in the sounds he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms up he was in the history and he so in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever and to us this morning he is showing us here yesterday the seem too deep and the same forever can the church say men Oh hallelujah I'm gonna paint a picture of the different things that are happening around is this birth of Jesus Christ for all of the Old Testament but the Branham said it's spoke of Jesus he said if you read the Bible and if you read a verse and don't see Jesus in every verse go read it again because he is a principal theme of the Bible every prophet every messenger every apostle every teacher and every believer what unites us is not Church or doctrine it's Jesus that is what brings us together it's because of Jesus whenever we lose sight of the Messiah we lose sight of the whole picture come the church say Amen so the picture is painted and God is about to unveil his masterpiece we have preached before there was so much locked up in God he could release it all at once through the Old Testament so the attribute in God of being a shepherd he used David to display the Shepherd attribute of God in God was locked up prophet so he used Elijah and the prophets to display that attribute in God was locked up the warrior he will fight your battles when God was was he used Joshua to display that attribute in God was the attribute of a deliverer so he used Moses for a small part of his story to show he could he could open up barren wounds he took Sarah who was dried up and opened her womb so short he could change any situation that he was the resurrection he is the resurrection he is the life throughout scripture even before Jesus got here we see Elijah praying for the boy was dead and that boy came to life we saw lepers healed we saw miracle I'm sorry the axe float we saw men who didn't even have the Holy Ghost but because they were expressions of his attributes he could not help but display what was locked up in God they made mistake they feel but they could not help be an extension of the attribute of God because God was fighting the gap what was locked up in him expressed it it could not have helped him God doesn't need healing for himself he doesn't need to be delivered he doesn't need a miracle it is for people who need the healing and need a miracle it makes no sense of the God to have it locked up I'm nobody can access it oh you don't hear me this morning the ability of God to open the blind eyes is not for his benefit because he is not blind you don't hear me this morning there the ability of God to make the cripples walk is is not for his benefit because he is not crippled is his hand is not too short that he could oh you know him it is morning can we preach a little bit so it's been God's business to get his attributes to be expressed up but when the Branham taught us that God needs a vessel he needs somebody to walk through it he doesn't want to walk through the the nature he wants to use somebody so in every age alien the mighty man of Valor disorder his strength is made perfect in your weakness well when Gideon lacked confidence and didn't lack self-esteem Gideon lack that his strength could be made perfect in weakness or you don't hear me this morning anybody in the house oh and when your back is against the wall a man like shunga who put the brandon described as a farmer with his little outfit when your back is against the wall in god had the attribute to say enough is enough I'm not taking this no more I'm not taking pressure from the devil no more I'm not taking the attack of the enemy no more I've worked too hard I've struggled too long I've given too much I've invested my all you don't hear me this morning and when shunga saw the Philistines coming shunga look around and he took the UPS quota it was not shunga it was not the outscored but God said that's the attribute of when your back is against the wall and you need to know it could be done look at shunga draw strength from him because true Shanga I surely attribute that's in me to fight when your back is against the wall hallelujah hallelujah anybody in the house this morning so God is unfeeling himself he's unfeeling himself he is slowly if my people will humble themselves and pray he is using profits he's using little boy since you said King she's Judy he's using woman he's using Hannah I'm the temple who is crying out and they are all expressing Jesus they're all speaking about Jesus they are not living for themselves they're not acting for themselves in their own little way you're speaking about Jesus and then the time came and the season changed then the hour came and caught had to find a way to slip the King onto the it without fanfare without attention because it's an infiltration because brother branham preach that the devil is a corner this evil age so he is kind of running things on the earth so God wants to bring a nuclear weapon and slippered through eternity into time to deal with this aberrant issue of Lucifer and his fallen angels [Applause] but the law of God requires two witnesses for everything to be established so he's setting things up and he starts off and he starts off with a priest who is that kinda half time priest he's not a full time priests name is Zakaria honest it's his requirement I think it's a fortnight in the year once in the year he has to go on and offer incense while the believers are praying he's offering incense to God and he is praying for the people but he also hasn't me because his wife Elizabeth has not had a child and it's been in their marriage in their relationship in this situation so he has a burden in his spirit in his Solem and while he's here doing his duties he has a visitor straight from the presence of Almighty God God sent a secret agent because all of the pieces have to be in position because the Messiah is coming somebody have to roll all the red carpet in secret because the devil can know it's happening so God sends Gabriel Gabriel Hamlet and Gabriel comes to zechariah zechariah your prayers have been answered you've been praying for a long time I just want you to know God has heard your prayers and I've come to let you know what a message to know you've been praying and sighing and crying Zakaria point incense and he's here Lord my wife Lord my house Lord our people and the angel Gabriel comes and say your prayers answered your wife is gonna have a child and Gabriel he disappears but he's on a mission because a few months later he has another visitation to do a little lady named Mary and spouse a man called Joseph I know you know the story but it's good to talk about Jesus but the parents and when we talk about him he comes near he loves when we about him me we could talk about the church we could talk about Jim I will talk about Jesus oh he loves to come there when you talk about him he loves to be the center of our attention he loves to be the center of our joy he loves to be the reason of the season not just in this chamber but in January in February in March on Sunday and Monday on Tuesday every day with Jesus it's sweeter than the day before can I just talk to you a little bit I'm gonna leave the notes we just wanna just talk about Jesus a little bit so here comes Mary everybody knows the prophecy a virgin shall conceive and people don't understand it and you know it's called talking because whenever Adam said it's unusual it's unusual when God talks is unusually much don't add up and it's not supposed to add up because here from my toes are not your thoughts neither I want my ways like your way so when I'm planning stuff it's all to confuse the enemy don't try to figure it out so a virgin shall conceive and here comes Mary doing what she's normally doing and that's usually how it is you go and about your normal routine you live in your normal life and then something interrupts your normal schedule to get your attention and here comes this Archangel Gabriel here Mary so what highly favored blessed art thou among all woman and Mary not buying the story yet said what you're talking about he ever say you're gonna have a child and it's his name shall be called wonderful his his name shall be called counselor his name shall be called and Gabriel is describing this think it was excited because with for centuries and for thousands yes sir three committees at the time this has been what they've been waiting for and then Mary asked one question how shall this thing be and give us said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and in the message we have seen his time come to worship but they Branson the Holy Ghost is the father so the child is the father's child so Mary's exposed to Joseph but she's excited because she has this message I'm gonna have a baby I'm gonna Branham dramatizes and she runs to Elizabeth it wasn't a walk and but the Branham described he said maybe they hug one another how you doing hoodie baby coming along and and Elizabeth says I'm not too sure you know this is about the Branham he says the baby hasn't moved it's been six months and you know normally by three to four months the baby should at least move something I'm gonna promise said that Mary see what I have something to tell you I'm having a baby too so but the Branham said Elizabeth I why I didn't invite Betty wedding I know you was engaged to Joseph but I didn't get Hoke I'm your cousin oh I didn't invite me I'm Mary see well I get to marry him yet I'm gonna Branham described you said and Elizabeth it's like what you telling me what you're talking about you uses to marry you you know you livin right you what you're talking about [Applause] I'm gonna pranam said Mary's as I described her experience with the angel and she's describing it and the angel told me this and he angel told me that and the angel told me and then she got to the pot and the angel told me his name will be called and she started calling him names and be the Planum said when the name of Jesus was spoken John in his mother's womb who hadn't moved before but the prams had the Holy Ghost filled John in his mother's womb he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was born from his mother's womb with a black ism after Holy Ghost at the name of Jesus there's still power in the name of Jesus hallelujah we know the story I'm not gonna be too long but we love talking about Jesus so everything is getting into place because John has to forerun the coming of Christ somebody has to roll out the red carpet for the King to walk on it come on now so John has a mission to foreign the coming after Messiah meanwhile why this is going on the wise men are walking all of this happening the wise men on their journey before the first visitation the wise men already left because but around say it takes about two years so then fellas to get there so Mary no gain would be wise men already know because they have seen this sign they have seen his star in the east and they're coming on the expectation for a perfect timing can the church say Amen oh can we give the Lord a hand oh praise [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory but the Branham is so wonderful in this message he say how Mary would have told me is it but he looked so pretty but if Adam describes you whole thing and where the random goes on to speak about how God moves things around for his purpose and he brings out in the same message and when you got time he could read it how God uses visions and uses dreams and he speaks of how a prophet is able to combine his subconscious and his conscious together so with his eyes open he could see a vision but unless you're a prophet God has to wait until normal man goes to sleep and his consciousness is asleep for his subconscious to be active for God to present himself in a dream so Joseph's brother Branham said is an honorable man he's wondering how to handle this situation how to deal with a situation with this Mary and Aqaba lead you you can imagine the turmoil how a handle in this situation and then God visits Joseph in a dream and say Joseph don't be afraid to take your wife because what is in her is of the Holy Ghost and God use a dream with her God is a dream with the wise men and God is fixing things around because this has to happen in perfect order Jesus is about to be born and harrogate inspired ezd government inspired to raise taxes because the law have to change the drive Mary to have the baby where he baby is supposed to be born and but the Branham says it was not easy for Mary I'm Bella Branham dramatized the conversation he said Mary will be saying to Joseph Joseph don't worry we're gonna make it we're not gonna be only ones on your road is other people after go to if we get in trouble we will get help when you wrote somebody will help a pregnant I'm gonna run described is a donkey that they would have gone on what donkey that was to carry the King I want you to go back the echo back had time with me to see this whole thing unfolding and to see the journey with Mary going through the night and brother Brandon said imagine Mary with ax Joe said do you want to take a ride on the donkey now because I've been on the donkey whole time and Joseph say no no no you stay there because you're carrying a baby and by the Branham is revealing this whole thing as it unfolds and falls and falls over time my mom says when God allowed the taxes to be raised God will do whatever he needs to do and will allow what the devil does to get him praise also so every action or reaction to you is for his purpose and for his honor and for his glory can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah but the madam said while he was thinking on these things he was a good man he didn't want his own name Maude but the balance said Joseph was thinking about being a shield for her and brother branham goes on and on and he's bringing out his whole beautiful Christmas story can the church say man glory glory glory glory glory and he said I went God reveal himself to Joseph he said when a man can reveal that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how many Creed tried to turn it back you're glad to be a shield so he said Joseph became a shield for Mary you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever you got a big she'll updated not the fiery darts off he said I hope I don't get too loud for them out there let them hear it too they ought to notice it you're happy to be a shield you're a doormat whatever wants to be it doesn't matter it's been revealed to you by the Lord and the Lord of Shirdi you by his word is the truth and confirm it to you to make it live again yeah it is mine nothing to go on can the church see man Oh glory glory glory can the church say man glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah but a random said I went Christ was being formed and Mary quickly come the Kings commandment all you people just as she was the Christ was becoming a baby ready to be delivered right then the persecution but this is coming in the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the Godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among his people he promises in his word and when that full as you see there is unusual things begin to happen that he promised that's the reason or a great social lives and things can't understand it it's foolishness to them now watch their formula council of churches just the time when the church is beginning to get to its feet where the supernatural is going to begin to work now they all went into that group and they're gonna try to stop his stuff so but the Branham is seen as Mary's about to have the baby all the persecution begins to rise up but Brown said this we see when you're praying and your boat a breakthrough that's the hottest pot just before you break through just before your blessing that's when the persecution begins Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my on Easter dear and brother branham is dramatizing he said Mary wasn't pain and after a while he comes out at the top of the hill and once again they look over into the city when they were both born over in Bethlehem the lights of the city many was there places was crowded people on the outside sleeping underground out along in the fields and the question perhaps the first time it struck Joseph what will I do if I can't find a place because this baby might be born tonight she's been in peeing all day so what if the baby is gonna be born tonight and but the Branham is dramatized and he said they're looking down across the valley wandering his eyes happen to look over sideways and he saw a strange sight you know it's usually right in time of trouble when supernatural things happen and he looked over there and he saw a star he had never remembered seeing one so big it looked so low like it was hanging right over Bethlehem and he looked up on etern after he helped Mary up on a rock to rest a little while he turn around to say dear did you ever notice and he could even see his reflection listen to the Prophet he could see the stars reflection in her pretty black eyes it's as if the problem is standing right there watching this whole thing unfold and look smiling dear isn't that strange he said Joseph honey I have that's in the Sun went down I've been watching that stuff somehow another I feel really strange tonight that something is fixing to happen he said it's usually that way you know you have that strange feeling as you begin to watch the star enjoys it the little mule taking his rest breeding and they watch the sir it had an odd action to it it didn't act like the rest of stars it it seemed to be Restless moving it was waiting for something watching for something to happen Oh glory glory glory glory and whenever I said no let's leave our little couple right here on the rock for a minute so but abandon leaves them on the rock and travels on the way back over to India to speak about the wise men and how God declares his doings in the heavens before he does it on it and he speaks of these wise men came from the line of wise men and Daniel was the Prophet he was their master and God is no respecter of person so he could use anybody and these men believed that there was one Gordon they would study the night and study the Stars and it would burn fire at night and the watch and the worship and every night they would climb up there as soon as the Sun went down and study these things just like we get together at conferences and study the Bible and word by word they knowed every move of them Stars and one night where they were obvious tutting and no wonder it was most alarming when a visitor appeared among them a stranger they had never seen that study for didn't know what was this was there no wonder they were alarmed they didn't know what to do about it it was a phenomena so it caught the attention has done something caught your attention to bring you to this great gospel to bring you to this great message to bring you to this great moment Oh hallelujah hallelujah brother Branham goes on I'm going to skip through it because I've already touched it but when the man said divine healing is for the believers the Holy Ghost is to them that believe not to the unbelievers and the only journey with their gold and frankincense and myrrh Oh hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand up praise I'm gonna balance ed on their journey they watched he said they never took anybody's would they didn't go down and consult any bishop or anything God gave them a sign they'd seen it it was the truth they took out after it it left away it was the one the scripture predicted to and friends that's what's needed today it's a revelation from God to follow the sign what is our sign annuity is the prophets message because he was a star in the hand of God for our day and he didn't point him to himself he said I'm his ability nomination I made the popular people to myself but I'm pointing to the resurrected Christ I'm pointing to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that's the message that we hold to our hearts today Oh hallelujah but if I said nobody outside but he's men saw it he said nobody saw the light that Paul saw when it struck him on the road to Damascus Oh hallelujah oh he said but when you are looking for it when you are ready to receive the real Christmas present the real Christmas give God's Christ give the Holy Spirit you're looking fit you see it's a heaven light send down from God out of heaven to be a record of Jesus Christ they didn't take anybody else word for it in the tea time it was Restless to see oh I just can't wait I don't know how much longer we'll go we will probably go to Jerusalem remember the light only shines in darkness it's the only way it's recognized if we live in the dark time so where the my name is Brainard in the daytime they couldn't see the star so they would be rested but at night when you see the star come out they would be able to follow it on down through the rivers through the sandbars and everything else and by the random types all of this as true your struggles through your trials through your journey to your situation you are following the revealed Word you are following Jesus Christ the light of the world straight to your promise hallelujah brother Branham said and I just want to get his words in it and look Bethlehem was exactly in line with Judea from where they and Jerusalem was in line with Bethlehem or what symbol if you can catch it here's Bethlehem and Jerusalem is up here and from where the Magi was coming they had to come to the ruslan first because before coming to Bethlehem I'm not gonna be too much longer do you get it the great big self-styled anomaly National Headquarters yes sir Jerusalem where all the denominations met together the Great Council met there so when these men they came and they come to this city and they taught there it is if anybody will know about this and can explain this great mystery light to us there's all the high priests here there's a doctors of divinity here there's all the PhD and elderly Oh brethren Jerusalem is in sight here we go we'll have it right into the streets there bull said where you going we got a great message where is it we see that's born King of the Jews who is this mystery light up there but Abraham said the cry goes out and nobody responded nobody knows what's going on they are sitting on with all the scrolls from the prophet Moses they have all the books and tips and they have no idea because they were not looking for the sign oh hallelujah glory hmm he said what's the matter what you see but ever I said it didn't have the answer and what I believed and said they haven't got it today they don't know what these things are where they ought to know it where the great heads of churches ought to be aware of these things but God always works in the minority and so humble that it goes right over top of them they don't know it but he fulfills his would like that that's it we get our own self twisted up in these great big things and we can't move God cut us free from them things then we can see what our we're living in if God has to walk through a dream again he can reveal it to you sure he said they had not the answer of them as serious like they didn't know they didn't have it at the headquarters neither do they have it today so what did they do they call for the Word of God he said that's the idea this says let's look up in the will of God and final where these things are and when they call for the word of god the Magi was smarter than a lot of people today the Magi saw according to the Word of God and it didn't have it and wasn't going to get it the phone know that there wasn't even the city that wasn't even a place he was to be born in Bethlehem of Judea of the least the humblest among all of them the little bitty tiny place not the big cell sty the wise men seen right quick the Word of God revealed it and I didn't have it and wasn't going to get it so they got out of that mess if we could just do the same get out of the mess where the random said after the girls are the mess then the supernatural appeared again so when around said while I were in Jerusalem trying to find out where Christ was gonna be born to start hid himself the star disappeared but when it came out of Jerusalem there the star appeared again there it was he said after they got cut loose from those things after they got out of all them conglomeration of their fussing arguing and everything down there with all the big headquarters was and the big high priests and doctors of divinity and and then walked around and what's the matter with these crazy people so they turned their cameras and got away from it but a man said as long as you tied up with a bunch of unbelievers I don't believe these things you'll never be able you'll be as blind as a bat cut yourself away from everything said of his mother father sister brother denomination or whatever it is he said he that won't forsake his own and come after me it's not even worthy to be called mine but a man said it means just what it says the Bible said is of no private interpretation if it's black is black and white as white as a prophets would it's the ultimate it's the absolute and every man that's born of the Spirit of God is tighter that no matter nothing will separate him from it he's tied to that word because it's Christ Christ is the word and Christ kind of lie about his word for he is the word and you and you say well I know he said that but he said there ain't no but and nothing about it he just said it that way and that's what it is he cannot change it he can't he's unchangeable he said heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away can the church say a man so I just want to touch on our star and we begin to wind down but the random said in exposition of the seven church it is the sedition churchy so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one Spirit of God working out the will and would have caught in different generations I would like to illustrate that from the word the spirit of god was mightily upon elisha then that same spirit came upon elijah in a two-fold effect then centuries later the same spirit which we call a spirit of Elijah in order to describe its ministry came back upon John the Baptist one day that seems per identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the Gentile church age he's speaking about himself now again the scripture says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that was oppressed of the devil as Jesus went away he told his side was a Terry until Pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him we'll come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his stead upon the earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they were do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church will manifest the same works as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other Church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to God it also says here that these seven stars or seven messengers to the seven church ages are in his hand he is holding them you know right away that if they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of God and authority of God not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what Paul said no man would dare to it takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of God in the power of the Spirit these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost they all stood up to the world they could do that they were full of God they were sent o authorized by God not myself or other men and in the pathways vision last major quote but Abraham said the mystery of the seven stars in Revelation which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels or messengers of the seven Church Ages and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches we have already discovered the truth of these two mysteries oh we haven't revealed who these seven messengers will but by the help of God we will and that miss you will be accomplished the seven ages we know they are listed in the world and we will deal with each so as to come up to this last age in which we live but in one last closing glimpse of this chapter see him as he stands there in the midst of the golden lampstands with the seven stars in his right hand oh it is breathtaking to see him standing there it is supreme deity he is the judge the priest the king the eagle the lamb the lion the alpha to Omega the beginning and the end the Father Son Holy Ghost he which was which is which is to come the Almighty they all in all they he is the author and finisher worry is that lamb he proved his words as he brought our salvation by himself no he stands in all of his power and all of his glory all things committed unto Him as church yes they stands amidst the lamp stands with the stars in his hand it is night for that is when we use lamps for the light and that is when the stars are seen shining and reflecting the light of the Sun and it is dark the church is walking by feet in the darkness her Lord departed is all but the Holy Spirit still shines out through the church giving light it is all sink first world and those stars reflect his light also and the only light they have is his liked how dark it is how spiritually cold yet when he comes into the midst of it his light and warm the truth is empowered and through him does the works that he did oh that he might get a glimpse of him as did John what manner of people we ought to be standing before him at that day but the random now begins to sweetie said if you haven't already given your life to him may you tell in your heart to go this moment and kneel down right where you are and ask his forgiveness for your sins and surrender your life to Him can the church say ma'am and I love in the same message we have found we have seen his star and come to worship but there Branham after speaking about all of this she begins to switch and a musician can play softly he said I got a good business I know it's flourishing he's saying that's what somebody might say brother do you know one of these days a heart attack might take you at 4:00 in the morning and you have to leave that business then where you're going after that he said when you love to have that wouldn't that be the greatest Christmas present anybody could get the gift of eternal life God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him civilization has traveled with the Sun from the east coming west we are in the West Coast now East and West has met we can go no further the oldest civilization is China plumb back the other side of the will remember is gone and sinners travel with civilization every thought of man is continually evil is just like it was in the days of Noah till it even grieve God that he ever made man but he has a little church that he wants to take he's got many thousands laying sleeping in it first watch second watch third fourth fifth six and this is the seven watch remember that's when he come in the seven watch and in that watch he found wise virgins and which that had the oil out of their lamp oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit if you haven't found that your lamb today my brother sister why don't you take that God's greatest Christmas present you know what today we get a great big present we wrap it up and we take $3.00 to wrap it up put all kinds of tinsel on it and many time you think is a great present many times you think it's a great present and a woman standing in a store the other day two of them talking one said she was going to get her daddy what talking her sister what are you gonna get daddy I'm gonna get him a deck of cards and a carton of cigarettes he said I got him a fifth of whiskey and I'm gonna wrap it up see the tinsel on the outside isn't doesn't declare what's on the inside he said but God has got a Christmas present for you tonight he wrapped it in a manger the outside wasn't very much but all the inside is eternal life won't you let this phenomenon of the Holy Spirit strike your life tonight and lead you to eternal eyes let us bow our heads just a moment all over the building you can stand to your feet we're getting ready to close that and I'm gonna continue reading what the Prophet said on that message he said in the quietness of this moment this little chopped-up if I call it a Christmas message one of them if you really believe it to be the truth and you've never yet found that eternal life you've never let the Great Holy Spirit lead you to that light would you just speak just now in your heart and say Lord Jesus I want to find that light I don't care what anybody else says it's me I'm the one I want to find that light would you raise your hands now while you have your heads bowed raising and I say pray for me brother branham I truly want to find that like God bless you little lady god bless you lady god bless you another raised hands I want to I want God's Christmas present god bless you sir god bless you lady I want God's Christmas send it to me Lord I don't care what it is if it comes in a manger or it comes in a barn I'm okay ho disgrace but it looks at the world how disgraceful I have to look to the world you know God's great gifts always meek man exchange look at Moses a great theologian great scholar but one day he met a light on the backside of the desert he took off his shoes a man 80 years old and whiskers hanging down to his waistline put his wife and his baby in a moon and a mule and went down to Egypt we got a whole army to take over for him that's a little thing friend that's twisting at your heart tonight he had found a flight that's the supernatural at the light of the day won't you let it lead you to Jesus Christ which can only give you life is there one listen to the prophet that hasn't raised their hands would say remember me brother Branham in prayer now god bless you another another is there anybody else who hasn't raised a man say I wanna fall I want to follow the Morningstar Christ I want to follow and find my Jesus this day I want to get away from all this here Christmas tinsel and things because someday it's going to be burnt with unquenchable fire and all those who are in tolerating with it will be burned with it the world a sinner will punished and it will perish with the world the woody loving people will perish with the wool and if you have those tell the love of the world in you you want to sell yourself completely tonight that Jesus Christ in his will raise your hands again now anybody that hasn't raised god bless you I just see that god bless you you don't know one minute somebody might raise an ax see what difference does have made by the Branham I'm ready madam said raising your hand is the difference between death and life he said if that hand went up like that and you really meant that there's something by you what is it that's the light I'm talking about that's a light that tells you I've been wrong there's will in me I don't want it anymore I'll raise up my hand that's a testimony [Music] remember what friends where the bottom said you know what a raise of hand is in every language under heaven a raised hand is a surrender a sign of surrender when raise your hands any army any way you raise your hand it's an international sign of surrender how many right now would say Lord I surrender I'm through I surrender god bless you god bless you Oh hallelujah let's pray Heavenly Father I realize it said as many as believe was baptized that's all it's necessary Lord if they believe you something's got to happen they are yours there are trophies of this little service of the word of God the presence of Jesus Christ here this fine group of people tonight gathered in here somehow maybe we might not seen it just with our eyes but we felt about our other sense our sense of feeling the sense of feeling in our heart our conscience our soul spoke to us we're in the presence of Jesus Christ the greatest Christmas gift the first real Christmas gift from God's a man and yet of all the gifts that we have received many of us has never received that great gift yet we
