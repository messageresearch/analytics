spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father i go to verse 23 and only not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even our ourselves grind within ourselves waiting for the adoption to eat the redemption of our body amen so let's go to ephesians ephesians chapter one i want to read from verse three blessed be the god of and and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according us he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and with our blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wearing in he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have a redemption through his blood the forgiveness of saints according to the riches of his grace wearing he had abounded to us toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known untowards the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ amen may the lord a blessing to reading reading of his word in jesus christ's name i just want to appreciate brother uh suleiman national uh the host pastor and also his wife and family and his church in tamil ghana and i want to thank you so much for hosting this visual convention for me it's a great blessing and more especially so important at this time of the year 2020 uh december so we thank the lord for making this possible that god could really touch his people amen and uh um today before i move further to greeting can we bow our heads i want to pray father lord in the name of jesus christ i want to thank you so much for this great opportunity lord just take the few words i'm going to say here lord may it be a testimony oh lord and let it bless somebody oh lord there somebody's heart and father that at the end of it all oh god we shall have every cause to say you blessed us thank you for everything thank you for everyone that are watching from the hookup and also all around the world i pray your holy spirit oh god to go out and touch every heart and redeem the people touch your people once again heal the sick and afflicted oh god take away every confusion and all the whole disunity the enemy is causing among the whole our churches and the world and father unite your bride once again to your word and let everything know god bring glory and honor to your name we ask it in jesus christ's name amen so once again i want to salute the other ministers that are here from different parts of the world to minister the gospel during this period of convention i pray that god will anoint you and your ministry and give you a portion of blessing that we can also receive from you the purpose for which god has made us to really meet at this time of great pandemic praise god remain for the sake of pandemic we have to do this kind of visual convention praise god amen but i know very well that yes we can do this to respect the government and everything but i know that we are already covered with the blood of jesus christ amen so at this moment i just want to give my title paving the way for your adoption amen and then i have um an inspiration bonsang's field sons a man and my subject is the mystery of his will amen i may not be able to stay too long because i just have just a short time to talk to you i just want to let you know that your adoption is not your bat amen your adoption is your blessing for we are predestinated into this adoption so every child of god is called in to be adopted god predestinated you and confirmed you into his own image he already have seen you adopted praise god a man and adoption abduction is to take place at the end time and now we are in this end time this is adoption time somebody say man praise god amen now listen here church please take your position because it is after the church takes its position we are called the adoption of sons by the holy spirit our ministry we speak out only when we need the holy ghost in the power and adoption god will adopt us do you believe that amen and this is just the main thing more especially at this time the whole world is falling apart and people are doing all kinds of things but god is gathering his people the bride is moving on the church of the living god we still move on in the midst of all these pestilences in the midst of all these demoralizations in the midst whereby the enemy thought that he got everything god is still moving in his power and leading his church ahead praise god a man and therefore we thank god for malachi 4 we thank god because the mechanics he brought us the mechanics and the dynamics together hallelujah and the mechanics and the dynamics together they are here to bring us again into the perfect state that god has predestinated us to and that's into our adoption our placing somebody say man therefore we need to just learn to understand that the hour we are living in uh brother abraham said here in the message recognizing your day and and his message he says here remember my vision i said is paul's people goes so we mine because i've done just exactly like him and million through their hands saying we are resting on that what recognize the day that we are living the time we are living the sign of the time that we are living in it may be lighter than we think one of these days let him that is outside stay outside and steal and he that is inside must ever be inside still the door we close praise god amen and then he says again if there is some here this hour that hasn't never walked in yet oh in jesus name my dear people don't look at this ignorant servant standing here illiterate unlearned uneducated don't look at that but look at the word that is being proven look at the great holy spirit who vindicates it today to be the truth we are at the evening time it's louder than you think god richly bless you blessed be the name of the lord you appreciate our testimony this evening my mind let's give the lord a hand to praise how we've been blessed thus far let's sing that song because he lives because he lives [Music] i

because i know he holds the future [Music] my life is worth living just because he lives [Music] if you have your bibles with you please turn with me to the book of ephesians chapter one ephesians chapter 1 i'm reading the first 14 verses paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood uh the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wearing yet abandoned towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had proposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance been predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the council of his own will amen that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he was sealed without holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen romans chapter 8. i'd like to take from verse 18 to 23 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in horse for the harnessed expectation of the creature we touched for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creator was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation grown age and travelled in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also amen which are the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to which the redemption of our body may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word god bless you i would like to appreciate her the host pastor for this privilege he has given unto me to come and be of service to god's people believing god that somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing we don't know how far those sermons could go but we want to do our very best to reach out to the source of god and to be honest about everything we'll say so that we can be a blessing to the body of christ all that has been put in may the lord bless it very much and that to his glory god bless every one of you in the name of jesus christ i would like to depending on what side of the world you are it could be morning it could be evening it could be afternoon whatever but this time i would like to speak on the subject in line with the thoughts of the program which speaks on the manifestation of the sons of god amen but i would rather speak on this the condition for this manifestation the condition for the manifestations of the sons of god amen the prophets in the message a fundamental foundation of our faith was telling the church why god brought us here and it is important that we know why we are here and what he has brought us here for and by this will know what our purpose is to achieve i'd like to read that for a background this morning as we look at this subject because i'm going to approach it uh in a different way you know many times we talk about people manifesting the power of god the glory of god those things will come the scripture already told us that this is what we are predestinated for he said we are predestinated unto adoption amen and i tell you friends we shall be adopted but these things must come by way god has designed it any man who will be adopted must first found the land where adoption is possible amen because it is not on every ground that you can be adopted then you must also have a witness in your arch that you are a son you must know who you are if you don't have an identity it becomes very difficult to know how to be pleased so you and i must know who we are first amen and then knowing who we are we must know the family we belong to because no family the kind of adoption we are talking about does not happen in a family where you do not belong as a son you must first be born into that family i know families do adopt children that they never give birth to that is one side but that is not the kind of adoption we are talking about this morning we are talking about a child being born in a house amen and that child being placed into his position of inheritance by the law of inheritance according to the scriptures you can never enjoy permanently and inheritance if you are not connected by blood meaning that somebody from another family line another bloodline completely can never inherit you the only person who can inherit you is a child born connected to your gene into your blood outside of that there is no inheritance and the inheritance i'm talking about here has to do with your blessing you might be a child in a family and your worth and your value is not better than that of a servant the scripture says so he said a child of a family is not better than a servant until he comes into his inheritance amen and before you can come into your inheritance you must undergo some processes amen and those are the process of growth when you come to a level of growth a level of conduct a level of maturity you have been prepared for your watch for your blessing when you become placed you come into an inheritance that is as good even the prophet used the word co-equal with your father and from that moment you can begin to enjoy expand your inheritances so it is a child born into a family connected to that family by blood that i'm talking about this morning so i'm saying before you can be adopted you must find the land of adoption there are so many churches on edge today claiming to be the way but god does not give honor to a ground where his name is not pleased and from the scriptures god has always had a chosen place where he put his name the prophet said his name is not on every wall amen god has always had a unified rallying position where his children bring their sacrifices otherwise they will not be accepted so you and i must find that ground amen because the material to prepare us to mature us for our adoption can only be found on that ground that is why today it is no use for you enjoying pentecostal carry-ons they will never bring you to adoption you will never manifest anything you can demonstrate counterfeit but adoption the blessing into inheritance is beyond pentecostalism [Applause] it is beyond wesley it is beyond looter amen the people who live in outer court will never come to adoption amen out of court fellowship i'm just running times for you outer court fellowship because everything god did in times shadows he has used it to explain only one thing and that is redemption amen in the tabernacle in the wilderness it gave them a tabernacle and in this tabernacle it divided it into three sections amen he said the first section is the outer court where it's available to everybody anybody can come in there and the experience in the after court is not actually an absolute experience are you following me amen it is for every tom dick and harry because why they live under in that outer court they live under the conditions of the elements natural elements of weather which as a twist and return all the time when people progress they come into the middle court which is a better protection amen because you are not at the mercy of sunlight you are not at the mercy of a rain you are not at the mercy of the wind you have come under a bit of a protection but the experience there is also not absolutely you cannot make a perfect christian in those regions amen time will fail me to break that down but a man who lives in outer court is only believing to being a christian he's not just a christian amen he might have been justified he might have repented but the root of sin that makes him a sinner is still there so every now and then is susceptible to all manner of life amen and we need to expand on this so that you see the journey into manifestation we talked about manifestation and everybody is looking forward to it we should look forward to it because the scripture in prophecy had already told us that nature we groan for each you know why nature is groaning because nature has seen a great blessing before they've seen original before they knew what god brought you an eye for and they saw it demonstrated through a man called adam and nature even beyond man knew those things were the truth some of us could doubt it but the trees don't doubt it some of us could disbelieve it but the waters the seas don't disbelieve it because these things happened in their presence they saw a son of god in the glory of the son of god they saw him demonstrating his inheritance they saw him acted as governor of this earth they saw god say i will stay there and he will stay here and they saw they saw the meaning of god giving adam the church of everything they want to see that again and by the scriptures they will see it again hallelujah because every now and then god has true types and shadows true manifestation proving that those things are possible if we do not manifest those things our purpose is defeated because the prophet doesn't look like i have enough patience to read from the code but let me say what the quote says the prophet said what did god brought man here for amen he said he brought you and i here to control to take charge and to govern this urge hallelujah and how do we do it we must look for how adam did it adam exercise jurisdiction and perfect control over this earth through just the spoken words let me tell you the word of god is powerful and it is still powerful and it is still in force how do i know the bible said the frames of this earth is held together by watch the word of god as the frame collapsed as the earth collapsed as long as the earth is standing the word of god is standing [Applause] as long as the earth is standing the word of god is in effect and that tells you and hi we can stand upon that watch and claim our promises we can stand upon that word and say god you said and the one who spoke must respond back adam was here living as the son of god i will read some few things and you will appreciate some certain things adam was here living as what son of god the meaning of sonship is that i have my replica showing that god has his own because what makes christ a son was because he came out of god are you here church and what will make you a son is because you came from god and that is why the prophet could make a powerful statement that even the new birth is not what makes you a son of god did you ever think about that your new birth did not make you a son amen you were a son before you were born again [Applause] it was your sonship that makes it compulsory for god to give you the new birth [Applause] if you were not a son you cannot be born again only sons can be born again and what makes you a son is because you came from god you were a reproduction of god's own genes i went into genetics the other time amen you will watch a reproduction of god's gene and what that means is this if they want to test a paternity still today the best formula for testing is to is an averse of your dream because it is medically or scientifically proven that the gene of a man it's only unique to a man and it can only be replicated through his own offspring are you following me meaning that if a paternity if a child's paternity is in dispute the best settler is to run what they call a dna amen and this dna is a chemical test upon the gene of the young boy and the uh as you call them the prospective fathers or the contending fathers it doesn't matter whether they are 10 or 15 or 20 men that are laying claim to one boy this boy cannot have features that the 20 that even two men can okay let me put it like this this boy cannot have features that will be similar to two men not to talk of 10 or 20 the features it will demonstrate will only be traceable to only one person [Applause] so if god calls you his child his son it shows that you have a tresebugin are you here church your gene your characteristics your features your mannerisms your actions everything about you can be traceable to god but then why do you need the new birth if you were born a son because the bible spoke about predestination here is that he has predestinated us unto adoption isn't it and only a son can be adopted i've differentiated from the modern day adoption for you is that right only a son can be meaning that only a son can be placed into his inheritance so if you are predestined a church it follows that you must bring forth the characteristics of your predestination are you getting it you must give the proof you must give the evidence you must give the testimony that this is my predestination amen sometimes the way we explain this predestination we make people to become complacent no sir we make people to live anyhow life if you were truly ordained you will bring forth the fruit of ordination [Applause] amen because christianity through christianity the prophet said it's a life that cannot be mimicked it is either there or not but if it is there it will speak out amen so these genes are already coded in you but something must bring them to life [Music] what brings your genetic characteristics to life is called the new best [Applause] this is why the prophet said eat less damage and why would you need the new birth because your natural birth even though permitted for all of us to come was not god's perfect will and it wasn't god's own divine prescription amen it was first practiced by the devil the your natural breath was a process for the devil to inject his nature into you and that is why king david said it was born in sin which you were also born in sin i was born in sin we were all shaped in iniquity we came to the world speaking what lies are you here church we are speaking lies when nobody taught us how to lie it doesn't matter where you were born you may be born in the house of a pastor you might be born in the palace of lawyers amen your first birth was a breath of defeat because the formula for your reproduction belong to the devil it's a breath of death it's a breath of darkness this is the reason that what makes sense you must be born again so god acknowledged that you have been born but you need to be reburned and your rebirth will do what will put death to that nature and bring a quickening to the gene of god in you then you can truly say if any man be in christ he is what a new creator all things have passed away behold all things have become new that new birth is not available outside today it's only available in the land of adoption [Applause] some folks do say well i could be born again outside i don't fight but if you are truly born again outside of the review what for your day and you stay still in the denominations and eating all those dead things i doubt your new birth and it's pure simple scripture on the day of pentecost i know the characteristics of the holy ghost there were a lot of people who came from everywhere amen men of galilee men of judea men of these men of death they all had one thing in common to call the thing of god something vile but friends it was the day of mercy so what did god do god raised the man called peter fresh under the unction and the anointing and baptism of the holy ghost and he told them men and brethren look at the time of the day not badly reasonable nobody saying get drunk at a time like this but this is that amen this is the fulfillment of prophecy this is the bringing to pass of dossier the lord and by the time he was able to place that experience in the word of god it created an hunger men and brethren what shall we do don't forget they came from different backgrounds they came from different denominations but when they were told what to do repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the holy ghost and they receive the holy ghost the bible told me it gave them a turnaround it changed their apertures when you receive the holy ghost it will change your appetite you will drop trinity amen you won't sit still under a woman preacher if you are still doing that you are not born again because it is a complete negation of the wage it changed the appetite of these folks you say how do you know preacher the bible said instead of going back to where they came from read your bible acts chapter 2 they continued [Applause] amen meaning they started in pentecost with their repentance with their water baptism and with the baptism of the holy ghost and after that what happened they continued they did not only just continued they didn't continue on seriously they don't go to church today and not come tomorrow it was settled in their heart they are not listening to that message of their day and comparing it with td jacks some of you are not born again yet because the message of the hour has not been revealed to you you say i listen to this and i listen to this and i listen to that to do a comparison you've not received the holy spirit if you receive the holy spirit it changes your appetites [Applause] sometimes i don't blame you amen i blame the preachers who are starving you who will not bring you to the knowledge of the truth the prophet said if you starve a child it will go to the garbage cans but this wasn't the witness of pentecost if you like say i'm only defending the message what am i restful i have found my own purpose in life amen allow me to generously declare my purpose i am raised for the defense of the gospel not a denominational gospel the purest gospel the world they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers there has got to be a land where adoption is possible [Applause] am i still preaching the scriptures they continued steadfastly oh hallelujah in what in apostles doctrine hey hey the pharisees doctrine was also there the sadducees were there the sahendra the council the scribes the herodias and thousands more denomination it was it isn't anything new it has always been there just changing into different names and flavors but these guys amen and it was not a little crowd it was a great crowd a crowd from among three thousand people we are baptized friends i baptized 40 something people at the time my muscle my rib muscle was tight for two weeks but here we are talking about 30 000 souls you can imagine the crowd at pentecost you can imagine that they will come from different backgrounds but these three thousand souls continued seriously committedly holy without looking right without looking left without being without lingering between two opinions this holy ghost will move from body to body its characteristics its behavior its appetite will remain the same if you cannot put your experience back to the world is a counterfeit experience they continued steadfastly in apostle's doctrine in fellowship and in breaking of bridge and the lord begin to hatch to them i like this life not just anyhow people souls such as should be saved because it's an entire work of predestination the truth is this friends you don't stray into the message you may think it's a strain nobody stray into the message it is the lord who calls you he calls you by his watch by his election hallelujah the prophet and the message spiritual food in due season he said if you don't come like that he wondered how you got in you love him this morning so coming back to that tabernacle in the wilderness again the men from justification amen under the elements it came under a place where they called the middle court where there is some sort of protection but don't forget even though there is protection the people who live in there live under the light of a candlestick this candlestick or what you call a lamp needs constant maintenance you have to be pouring oil you have to be cleaning the week because of carbonizing if you don't do constant monitoring and maintenance you are going to create a problem amen because the lamp you live by is still a man-made light so the experience has gone far but it is not absolute this is where many people arrived in they call it sanctification and they can do so nice so well and if possible equate that for the new birth experience but friends don't trust it still because even though you are sanctified you are only cleansed and set aside for service what makes you a sinner with you all of my mouth i still say is still there that snake that's happened that old nature that root of sin is still there but you know what you've done you've blocked contact you've pruned you've pruned this connection so you can live nice as long as there is no pressure you are like a vulture putting on a peacock experience amen you know if these things do not come from you a vulture can never have the feather of a peacock is it possible normally it's not possible but if he wants and so desire he can get some now he cannot grow it but you can attach it hallelujah attachments can last a long while but let me tell you the gum of attachment will expire sometime [Applause] so you need constant maintenance to look like who you are not are you catching it even those who do make ups you see how they constantly they have to they make up in the morning at night they are removing it and doing makeup remover when you see their table they have all set of chemicals for what for constant maintenance because the way they were trying to look is not exactly how they are nature cannot bring it out in them and that is why it is called cosmetic [Applause] padding i hope you are not becoming cosmetics amen because when there is so much artificial on the outside it speaks of the inside oh glory to god people don't like this kind of gospel but you want to manifest the sons of god amen you think you can bribe god with your a's and ooze and that amen the only emotion god knows is his wedge outside of the world forget it that is why today we have become more bluffers than genuine men we make so much claims and there seems to be no life to back it off it has become a cosmetic religion are you enjoying the lord friends you've got to enjoy the lord it's his words amen all right then but when that man is able to move from the middle couch hallelujah and come into the holiest of the holies it is at that point the prophet said the world is actually shot out and he himself is shot inside in another description in the future home message the prophet said what happens at that stage is that the spirit of the lord is ready to come but before it comes it must it must clean the old house amen and your spirit that has been used to the influence and control of that mean nature must be what must be renewed did you hear the scripture talk about mind renewal amen be transformed by what the renewal of your mind a new heart and a new spirit god is not going to bring another amen even when you use the word another is to tell you the cleansing and the renewal your spirit will undergo and the prophet the review what explained that and it said in the message future oh what happens is that when the spirit of the lord does comes it comes with fire baptism it is in line with god's entire program church before the city that john saw coming down the first quarter city that will take the center stage on the earth where christ will rule and reign from before it can come this earth must be renovated the renovation of earth is going to be by fire and the prophet said the way god is redeeming the earth is the same way as redeeming you that is going to live in that heart hallelujah because when heaven and earth meet together there must be a perfect match we are waiting for the city that john saw coming down that city is our child it's our reflection is who we are we must look the same is a prepared city for a prepared people [Applause] in the same way this earth is being renovated for that city is the same way you are being renovated after all the scripture told me ye are the temple of the living god as in the health got in his justification he got his justification he's been baptized in the days of noah he got his sanctification by the shedding of the blood of jesus christ but sin and contamination is still here even though the earth has been sanctified are you seeing the type but i tell you one of these days there will be no sin there will be no contamination there will be no virus whether corona or not there will be no one there will be no one gem they will never stretch we shall live on this earth because the bible said there will be nothing that we hurt or destroy in all my holy mountains for god to guarantee that he gave us a promise this earth will be renovated by the baptism of fire [Applause] that is what you call hell fire [Laughter] that's what you call one hell fire lake of fire amen lake of fire is not going to exist side by side with you in eternity there is no scripture for that no revelation of the word for that god is going to camp the believers upon the breath of the earth and he's going to send a fire baptism upon this earth i don't know for how many years it's going to burn but it will be burnt for as long as a renovation is necessary so that everything unclean will be wiped out and when the whole wiping is done the earth is ready to receive the city that is the way god wipes your heart amen it burns it and neither leaves roots nor branch everything is wiped out hallelujah sin can no longer to come to you by desire amen it can come by sight appeal but there is no desire of sin in you this is what god does amen in order to set your mind ready for the new householder so when you have the baptism of the fire you receive the holy spirit and what does the holy spirit does the prophet said it strikes your seed your dream comes alive amen your soul comes alive and you become if any man be in christ he is watched all things have passed out beyond all things have become new you become a new man in christ amen you become settled no more true opinions you only want one thing and that is the word or nothing else in all your actions your thoughts your idea no longer matters amen what did you find by that you found the land where adoption is possible let me tell you the new birth takes place only in the message the new bed like we know the new bed should be amen if you want god's program for this hour take that as the truth i know we are living at the day people have so many sympathies for all the churches for all the denominations i don't know what your headache is you didn't bring no man here and you are having some patches amen can you love a person more than his creator allow god to run his program there was a time it was matching luther all the portion that god was was giving them there was a time it was wesley the content that god was was giving them there was a time it was pentecost restored all that god wants was giving them but in these last days [Applause] god wants something beyond the best god wants the fullness and that is why the spirit of truth returned oh man the prophet when he sent a messenger he was first a messenger listen to me close earlier than you think he was first a messenger to laudacian church age don't forget that and that was revelations chapter two and chapter three unto the angel of laodicea right and that was why the book of the prophet ministry was spent in love this year 1946 to 1962 the prophet was a messenger to laudacian church age hallelujah but even the prophet knew that the ministries in that era could not bring perfection are you catching it but the ministry in that era was what he called the years of preparation it wouldn't bring perfection but it is enough to prepare people amen and that was why the fullness of the wedge was not restored at that time the focus at that time was signs and wonders amen and let me tell you all the supernatural available was waved to this generation before this generation up to a man tommy husband who never came into tot pool spiritual men will understand what i'm saying tommy husband never came into the revelation of the wedge the full review mysteries of god but to the essence that he knew of the ministry to the benefit and the partaking of the signs and wonders the healing and the discernment look at what tommy says he said we we preach christ this man lived christ and he didn't see as much as you saw his eyes were not open to see the extent to which you have seen he said i can see jesus on two feet walking the streets of jeffersonville those were powerful statements [Applause] with the much that he knew if coming under the first and second pull could speak like that what you expect me to speak when the predestinated mystery of his will has been revealed i am saying the ministry that heals your body the ministry that touches your spirit couldn't bring you to perfection it couldn't bring you to adoption that is what i'm saying because the sign in the hands heal your body addresses your body condition messianic disarmament addresses your spirit condition it went into the inner recess of your spirit to bring out your secrets and tell you your solution but it is only the deadpool that addresses your soul and until your soul is reborn you cannot be talking of adoption there must be a breath amen the sun must be born first before the sun is too touched before the sun is strange before the sun is mature his maturity will be how much he has yielded to training hallelujah the fullness of the world was not given at that time so your training is a building block it cannot be perfect come on church but that is not to say that the ministry of the prophet ended like that or became truncated and that is not to say we will need another messenger to bring us to perfection that is another impersonation of the devil this is what it is william brown was only a vessel being used by christ it was christ under the first pull healing of the body it was christ under the second pool healing of our spirit and it will be christ again in the deadpool healing of our souls my son in whom i travail until christ be born in you amen christ wasn't born by the first or second bull it was the thoughtpool that produced christ [Applause] so for the third pool to come and bring us to the land where adoption is possible what did god do the ministry of laodicean messenger had to give way to the ministry of christ himself did you catch it did you catch it did you catch it this is why you will hear the prophet said i was not the one that appeared at ohio river i was only the person near when he appeared did you catch that but more beyond that let us come fast forward when the full word of god was to be born into manifestation in the message says is this the time six months before a powerful event that changed the course for the bride before the blood of christ turned a corner god sent a vision this we can only preach among believers god sent a vision and in that vision all the prophet saw was a blast and it looks so real to him that he thought that might be the end of his life he even went home to his wife to make preparation to set us out in order and to talk about how you know post will abraham how the family is going to be surviving that was how that vision was so real to him but what was real to him was not the interpretation that was why when the prophet was preaching the message says is this the time he put a lot of guesses amen could it be this could it be that could it be this could it be that amen and we cannot establish ourselves on guesses the blight can only be established on revelation beyond the guesses of the prophets hallelujah god has a revelation god has a blessing amen god was only announcing i hate what he was going to do on earth and true to this at god's right time seven injures actually swept down and it was a most terrible blast hallelujah and when they swept down what did they do they took the prophet in the midst of themselves and gave him a temporary rapture hallelujah why did they come down the prophet said they came with a message the meaning the revelation of that message they came with is only known in their midst so they had to take the prophet into the constellation of themselves to give him the revelation and when they brought him back god gave him a charge you were in the west go now east why did that event took place at tucson west to show that the sun was setting for the church of the world hallelujah why did god tell him to go back east jefferson to show that it will soon be the rising of the sun another day is going to be declared a new dispensation hallelujah friends god is not building a straight world god turned the corner and what did they tell him to go and do go and open the seals book amen it's become controversial to many but to those who have the spirit of god it's a certain sound hallelujah is to announce the grant for adoption go and open those hills amen because those revelations that are content in there amen they are necessary to abuse a man are you catching it to build a man to watch to a full stature to build a man to abduction material so it must be opened and he lost all the seals and when he finished losing the sales even the prophet said many things that god revealed in the seals and after the seals came better than his personal judgment [Applause] meaning that he himself never knew many things if he was to be our tutor under the holy ghost he must know his curriculum he must understand the syllabus the syllabus must be perfected in him the perfection of syllabus was what the angels came to give him hallelujah so that christ can become the captain of your salvation [Applause] are you catching it are you catching a church he said go back and lose the seals and here is the testimony of the prophets when those seals were loosed without us going into the content amen because one of the content of the seven seals is seven thunders itself hallelujah amen when you come to the seventh it unfolded into three things is that true will go with me all my life but i'm going to speak of one hallelujah and he began to speak of that one till he left praise the lord but suffice to say that the content of the seals we are necessary to build you an eye it wasn't just one thing it was the entire bible from genesis to revelation that is why the prophet after the seal said there are things we have said that we've got to pull back amen because under those seven church ages under the age of loud this year he spoke certain things by appealing to many studies but when the angel of the lord came down it became something else that was why the prophet himself said my bible became a new book amen because things that he knew be that he thought he knew before we are brought plainer hallelujah so it wasn't a condemnation but a progression of revelation a capstone of revelation a perfection of revelation so that this end time church can be perfectly touched and they have perfect understanding wherever you find out is the land of adoption why should our teaching be perfected when you go to the old testament when a child is born are you following me when a child is born and it begins to grow to a stage of being educated the father gets him a tutor this tutor has only one job to teach this man this child this son who has been born all the ways the leanings the styles the ideas the business understanding the methods the approach of the father let me tell you you can move your mountains amen you can scatter your heels but it's unconditioned [Music] because god until god can trust you he cannot allow you the use of any power listen to me church the power that can close collapse this earth and create another one to live inside is in you [Music] [Applause] but what is the use of a power without character you will become a dictator you will misuse it can i have a witness of that [Applause] power with character is fit to rule power without character will work for satan this is why you must come into the land of adoption the land of adoption is where you have the perfect curriculum you don't just have the word you have the spirits you live under the shaking the glory of god that is the onliest of their holies you love him church so this tutor has got only one thing the father is too busy to train the child by himself but he got a trusted tutor with an up-to-date syllabus [Music] not somebody who splices the tape not somebody who sees discrepancy contradiction in their tapes there is no contradiction whatsoever [Applause] it is your unwillingness to move with the tide of revelation it is your willingness to move with the leadership of the holy spirit that gives you contradiction what must be upon what that is what the grace any preacher could have is to be able to rightly divide the words he said this here and he said this year let me say something to the audience all over the world the prophet said there cannot be two truths on one item of doctrine that opposes each other listen to me again there cannot be two opposing truths on one subject of the wedge you come with the truth and it opposes what i have and we both say this is the truth this is also truth on one item of the word it is not true one is a lie or the two are lies or one is a lie and the other is the truth [Applause] if you care for blessing if you care for adoption it is your responsibility [Applause] to know which is the truth have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons how many of you know the truth and because you don't want to be injurious to the feelings of one another you are shying away from the truth let me tell you compromising has never worked it has us always destroyed happy is that man who does not shun to declare the old cancer [Applause] i don't want to be popular with men all men do not have to love me but let me have favor with god that is christianity amen so if you are lingering between two opinions on any subject you better go search the wedge the message of the hour is a certain sound follow the progression of revelation and your life will line up because before you can be placed you need proper teaching in these days of error we need proper teaching amen you see why the devil is attacking the seven angels that came down the ring of mystery they will attack it because that is your open door for adoption they don't want you to be pleased i'm going to tell you something about sonship in a minute if they are denying this amen and they clustered around the message there is no truth in them amen if they are telling you other reasons why this came other than why it came for which is to bring the entire revelation upon the total wage there is also no truth in them i don't care how long you've held it you got to repent if you want to be placed this is not association amen this is identification the entire word of god has been opened and the curriculum is very rich spiritual food in due season so perfect because when the father needed his son to reflect him in order to be placed amen meaning in order to be abducted to be in charge of inheritances he got himself a tutor he must be an honest tutor who knows what he is doing he must understand his curriculums very well amen he knows what he exposes his students to and is only god one teaching every subject it takes amen is to bring in to the father's reflection church think about that so that one day the father will look at his son even if his face looks like the mother but when he listens to the son when he sees his manner his approach he will see himself hallelujah [Applause] i don't know how jesus physically look do you know this is the closest picture to hitch under inspiration that's what we are told amen but i want to know i know his life i know his manner i know his characteristics i know his ways that is what the tutor must teach me i must look like him in my appearance in my thinking in my attitude in my action in my reaction in my manner in all his ways hallelujah i must look like him even when people disagree with me in the way i react to it i must look like christ when he sees that it will see his reflection friends friends before a ghost meet could see his reflection in a gold that is walking upon there will be a lot of beating oh isn't that why the prophet in the message perfect faith he said it will mean a lot of shaking down for me it will mean a lot of shaking down for you we are going to drop many things right from our opinion to our thinking to our ideas to our habits to our lifestyles because we want to look like him he said but together by the grace of god we shall make it you know why because we are predestinated and may i say today the true church has made it this is why the true church must get the truth five fold it was a prophecy in 50s but by the grace of god it's happening now [Applause] this true five-fold is not brought by denomination this true path flow fivefold is not arched by denominations they are asked by the calling of god they were given the perfect word they know their position the prophet never explained the ministries for nothing he told us who the pastor would be he told us who the apostle will be who the teacher the evangelist the prophet he was blessing the offices and every true faithful will find themselves in that place and become a blessing because holy spirit under through you amen will bring the church to perfection it is not a sacrilege if you don't know what it takes to be adopted your ministry cannot produce adoption but if but in ephesians chapter four isn't the five-fold described there do you see how powerful their ministry will be and somebody denies the five-fold you won't come to perfection for the work of the ministry for this for that till we all come to what i think we should read that i think we should read it amen i'm not looking for a future of fivefold we have him now amen let's read what that fivefold will do oh glory to god let me just take it from verse 11 you when you get home you can read from verse 7. he said and he gave some apostles and some were prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what the perfecting of the saints the spirit of truth in these last days oh my what is the holy ghost giving for continuation of the work of christ amen god sent us an egg planter the first sheep in this age that ripen to show that more of such will come hallelujah the same holy ghost that gave us the messenger to develop the curriculum has given us the true five-fold who we teach the curriculum under the unction of the holy ghost to do what to bring perfection [Music] perfecting the saints is it my word is it his word if it is the scripture you can't stop me from saying it the fivefold has a ministry to perfect you mind in this land of adoption for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of christ amen they are to edify you they are to do the work of the ministry they are to bring you to perfection glory to god till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ what a great responsibility upon the fivefold the truth of the holy spirit to teach the curriculum that has been fashioned by the opening of the wage by the angel who commissioned by the angel of revelation 10 who commissioned revelation 10 7 angel he took him out of being the messenger to love this year and express himself through the messenger hallelujah to perfect his bride that was why when this ring of mystery was formed after the angels ascended what was the testimony of the prophet he said and it was our lord up there it was the lord jesus christ who came down to commission a servant to open the entire curriculum so that this end time tutors under the holy ghost will be able to teach the sons of god [Applause] [Music] to look like their father amen you could see why outside of christ you cannot be perfected even the world fight for the strengths of denominations the book of revelation is strange to denominations amen and unfortunately it takes the fightful to do the job so this five-fold is not bought by denominations they are not denominational ideas so we've moved beyond the range of 1955 hallelujah we have come into the open world where each servant true fivefold knows their position they are calling and what they are sent to do for the bride and his working church his working church this church is going from glory to glory hallelujah we are seeing the blessings of god among us we are ripening each day because it is only the word that heals it is the word that sets free the word stretching without hands he unstopped deaf ear and is changing the sinner to saint i am seeing that and more will come because it is the perfection of the syllabus [Applause] [Music] if you aren't happy with that you need to come into the land of adoption by the way the use of the word land of adoption was in my statement it was the prophet who said true he said the land of adoption is in the holiest of the holies which we know it is the watch and the spirit the total watch and the spirit in these last days oh glory to god are you seeing the progression amen when this tutorial is going on listen i got to read something the prophet said what brings you to adoption what brings you to your placement amen when you start the adoption please understand this according to romans chapter 8 listen to me it might sound strange to you but this is the truth the fullness of your adoption is your body change that's the word is that to which the redemption of our body the what to wheat means to know so the earth is not just groaning to see you shut the heavens speak things into existence amen they want to see you fully restored because your body redemption takes them back to the beginning your body redemption brings the false quantity which brings perfection to the earth and they know that from that moment there will be nothing that will destroy or hurt again oh hallelujah this earth is tired of soaking drinking innocent blood the earth tells itself there will be a great day coming we are no wickedness do you know how many abortions have been done over the night the earth saw it amen inside it we have plenty of unwanted filters he saw it it doesn't want that he knew there will come a time that there will be no such things again that time will not come until you have a body change but while we wait for the fullness we've got to enjoy our blessing because there is blessing in adoption the blessing takes place before the body changes that is why even the prophet himself in revelations series he said the fullness comes at the resurrection the change of your body which is perfectly in line with the scriptures to which the redemption of our bodies but here church why are you being tutored and why must you listen to teaching so that you can be adoptable now let me make a striking statement and i'm going to say it with the prophet there are many who will become sons but will never be able to come to the place where they should be if you doubt let me read it for you because i want to strike one or two things as we're going to close now amen don't forget my own subject is the condition for each many people we have talked about manifestations how this will happen how that will happen how my brother may need rain and i got to speak it to him those things will happen and friends those things are happening it is not a sacrilege because i know they are and that is in line with also the scripture it was in adoption the prophet talked about the illness of our inheritance and he said the endness of your inheritance is the down payment of your inheritance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] meaning that whatever you are looking forward to you can be enjoying the teach beat now every once in a while and unfull and purpose will be given to this ruth in order to know our god is in our midst amen how many can testify that the life i used to live is no longer what i'm living now how many can testify that god has helped him to drop some habits how many have testified can testify that you have overcome certain prejudice certain behavior certain habits in your life if you have that testimony you are enjoying your enemies [Applause] and you know why you are having that testimony it's a witness that one of these days this body this physical dying body is going to give way [Applause] for a glorification because it has already started if you don't have that testimony yet do something about it because nothing is wrong with the word but everything can be wrong with your life you cannot make him a liar hallelujah you should be able to tell who you where and who you are now amen you may not have arrived to where you should be but there is a work in progress there is a daily progression from glory to glory if it can heal your sickness it can save your soul it can change your life it can remove your captivity house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ [Applause] you must have that testimony it's important you do christianity is rest it is not up and down rising today i'm falling tomorrow that's not christianity christianity is a change christianity is an appetite and hunger for higher ground i'm pressing on the upward way new height i'm gaining every day still praying as i'm onward bound no downward bound not zigzagging i'm what bow lord plant my faith [Music] [Applause] if yours is not like that then somebody told you be comfortable he's deceiving you he's a liar hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] don't mind me if i look crazy this morning i'm just enjoying the lord i'm just enjoying what i know to be the truth this is what i live for this is all i do this is what i post about hallelujah now i'm saying this serious condition as i wind down when you come into the land of adoption and you have a witness by the new birth that you are a son of god because there's a language in the bible now are we the sons of god do you know what the bible says and it will look as if that there is no predestination involved but what the scripture is telling you is that the realization done on you are you catching it they don't joining of realization now i know [Applause] who i am lord i can see now [Music] but you can be a son and yet you never get placed in your inheritance my brothers my sisters what places you is your conduct your response to the tutoring this is why to every believer profanity must not be in our vocabulary [Applause] profanity is taking spiritual matters lightly if god taught us conduct if god taught us order if god taught us doctrine that is the entire syllabus of the message we must follow it [Applause] if you truly have the holy spirit you will look for it many of you are inventing your ideas for worship where did you get it from god sent a messenger to show us how to worship hallelujah do you know the people who inhabited who took over the land of israel were destroyed at a time simply because they overrun god's church order it's in your bible until they had to go and fetch a prophet of israel from captivity back to the land of israel to do what to teach the people the way of god's worship so the lions and devourers and the hyenas will not destroy them again spiritual hyenas and lions are divorcing souls of men today because you don't know your church orders you want to sing you want to do things like the pentecostal you want to do things like it wouldn't work in the message [Applause] [Music] don't follow the message affectedly let pastors like churches let's go and look at the order again the prophet never gave those sins for nothing is to show us the secret of god there must be a right response i like it conduct all the adoption isn't that what the entire world is all about that's the old syllabus church we must follow it you want to get married you must follow it don't invent your local ideas amen the word of god is universal it's right over every customs and traditions come back to the world but i've always found out this if a man does not have the spirit to quicken the word to him he cannot cope with the word but i can cope with the ideas amen they can cope with what some men touch them let's come back to the word friends amen this is what the prophet said make no mistake about this a man that is filled with the holy ghost will be in the word all the way oh [Applause] [Music] because listen to what the prophet said i must read this one and i hope i get it there are so many but we can read all but let's read one or two amen amen you love the lord this amen let's get this now in the message the position in christ you may not bother yourself preach in 1960 may 22nd in the morning now paragraph 73 i have here now placing the sun fasting after the sun was in he become a son but we find out his behavior is what sets him to adoption whether he behaved right or not hallelujah now i'm going to rob this really hard listen to the prophet because i don't mean it to be rude please don't really don't really think i'm i'm mean i don't want to be what worries me is to take people and preach to them this god sends truth listen to this and then we turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing that just nearly ruins you sorry they will come back around and just keep doing the same thing and say they got the holy ghost the prophet said that just nearly ruins a man your attitude to this god sent truth is what determines your pleasing in adoption and in another message the prophet said the attitude i'm talking about is your obedience how much obedience are you to the reveal what for the hour how approximately how close are you keeping the wedge have you looked into the conduct have you looked into the other have you looked into the doctrine or you are coming with your devices oh i could preach we could just get along and do all kinds of things no sir the prophet said for everything you do even if it could be a tool to bring many souls to god there is still the will of god to be sought don't just be running up and down get the will of god and do your running inside the truth god is not going to accept you because you can sweat for him no no no no no he's not going to accept you because you can do so much for him whatever you are doing must come back to the world [Applause] if it is not you are wasting your time it is your obedience to what he says your conduct around what he says because the tutor is not going to teach you anything but the wishes of your father the business method of your father the approach of your father how your father conduct himself how he behaved so that when your father looked at you by orientation you are looking exactly like him [Applause] this is the aspect where many feel and think it's just sufficient to serve the lord but listen to this i'm going to read one another one listen to this carefully in the message here in him 1956 september 38th paragraph 26 the prophet said and then the father after he had given the totals the right to raise his son the tutor had to bring word to the father how the son was progressing now yet he was air of all things but yet he didn't come into legal possession until there was a ceremony and he had fully done that which was right and was worthy now listen to this now many people is in the health today and i say this with all respect there is perhaps many perhaps many certain right here who is absolutely living under your privilege as sons and daughters of god i won't say you will be lost listen no because when god saves you and loses you then oh my i'm not trying to preach doctrine i'm only saying if god now if you are not just mentally worked up but if god saves you knowing he is going to lose you it defeats his purpose it doesn't do that when he saves you you are saved either hearing my words and believe it on him that sent me at everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but is passed from death onto life so you are still a son and daughter but you are living under your privilege and your conduct each day as the holy spirit brings it before the father gives away the things that you do and you are still a son and daughter but you will never be brought to the place where you should be did you hear me great gifts that are in the church are so misused no reverence to it and just a bunch of carrying on until it even brings disgrace in the public out that the holy spirit would like to govern that bring it down bring it down isn't that something powerful we should think about you won't be lost but you will never be brought to the place where you should be meaning you will never be placed but you will be resurrected or you will have a body change you enjoy the fullness of adoption but you were not placed into your inheritance say can you back these statements up that the prophet said it is enough for me but if you challenge that i will back it up with the scriptures as i wind down by the grace of god do you remember polycarp let me start with the message did you remember polycarp polycarp by the revealed world would have been the messenger to the second church age that's what the word said and i believe let me tell you the prophet has a scripture for everything they touch it is the poverty of our understanding that makes it strange to us are we coming through the scriptures for you in a minute but let me start from here and i've shared some of this before polycarp would have been the messenger of that age it was fun worthy it was fine qualified but he messed up in a conduct he has too much sympathy for organization and because of that he was disqualified he lived under his privilege as a son of god it was never brought to the place where it should be [Applause] he missed his blessing it means his adoption but in glory you will see him it was a saint of all ages this is a mystery of adoption now revealed i'm not preaching mystery be careful of those who say they are preaching mystery mysteries have already been preached and revealed what we are doing is recalling revelation hallelujah it is the job of the fivefold we are not we are not tell we are not tailors to cut and sow the dress of the bride sister brother has already been sown [Music] and a spell of fit because the lord knows your sizes hallelujah what i need to do is to furnish you with the garment to go into the wardrobe and give it to you and dress you up [Applause] i am not a cook i'm a waiter a server because the food has already been cooked it is a full course menu sister will have callings under the seven visions that were spoken of or seven dreams that became interpreted in the message size is this the time he saw the spiritual foot the entire revelation of the world as a food being served by the right person it was saved by the prophet because that kind of meal can only be made available by the messenger it was well cooked with enough salt with enough curry time and seasoning amen my job is not to cook it again it was cooked and frozen it was touched so what i need to do is to bring it out of the storehouse and warm it on the microwave of my knees and serve it to you you must never feed on me you must never feed on any fivefold you mustn't even feed on the prophet messenger not to talk of little little wheelies like us you must feed on the lord jesus christ unfailing by the word so no cook here and no taylor here dress where and wait us to serve enjoy the serving polycarp was supposed to be the that would have been his blessing into his inheritance but he missed it because of his conduct his level of obedience and yet the man who became the messenger irenaeus was a student under police he lent at his faith think about that do you believe the reviewers come on friends let me come to saul and david do you know even let me start from eli the priest of god do you know the plan of god was to establish enlightened priesthood forever that his priesthood will be from his generation to generation is that scriptural that's in the scripture why did he miss it he missed it because of compromise it can rise up to discipline it can't right it does not have the will to appropriate the world it's all your con that's why i said you gotta got the right tutor and whatever you have been taught your action will be weighed by it because god must trust you before it places you you can have a fantastic great ministry and yet you have some some little little rubbish around you it will change your life [Applause] what did god also it was on the day that god will have permanently established the kingdom of saul what david had saul was meant to have it by the scripture read your bible succession of kingship throughout his own generation over israel it's in the bible so the prophet never taught outside the scripture that would have been his inheritance your blessing is your inheritance and the ability to enjoy and spend it but god is not going to give it to a man i'm going to wind up in march 11. already winding down but god is not going to give it to amateur what david eventually enjoyed as a covenant that it will never he must always have a son to sit on the throne of israel do you know it was a covenant it was a con it was a covenant of saul the great grandchildren of david reminded jeroboam do you remember that when jeroboam amassed 900 000 army to come and fight 400. leopold and told him he said don't waste your time if you were bequeathed it was the failure of my father that gave you part of the kingdom of israel you might have gotten many but god is not many you as is with us for once that guy knew who he was i like that he said do you know that god gave covenant to my father david a bypass or woman it was a grandchild he said and the covenant he made to david was a covenant of salt salt is a preserver it means an enduring covenant that can never decay that can never expire it will always be enforced my how many seats of abraham are here our covenant so convenient of salt thy sage shall possess [Applause] let me say it don't be my enemy don't be my enemy because i will possess your gates [Applause] you are wasting your time the moment you become my enemy you lost the bathroom that means your gate is ready for me to take over and believe me i will take it over because it is in prophecy that i must take it over i am here to be an actualization of the wage i am here to give a proof that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever don't be my enemy because i will possess your gates those who bless you shall surely be blessed [Applause] those who curse you let us hang it for them maybe they will repent some days hallelujah what became the inheritance i'm saying it of of david was meant for saul i say it by the scriptures the philistines were ready to battle they were battling and they surrendered entire israel and saul had somewhere somewhere told him don't disturb yourself go to social mountain prepare me the altar prepare the sacrifice i'm coming that is the wedge [Applause] can we just trust the world the problem why you are always anxious is that you keep looking around you keep trusting your feelings he said i will not fear what men will do unto me because my confidence is a covenant of salt when the enemy invoke it god will respond hallelujah wait there i am coming that was what someone told us all but this soul is not used to obedience god sent him to go and wipe out a malachite because of the fear of people having the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect to a person he spears something and you see this man who does not know obedience to the word also has one habit he can't repent some of you are like that to say sorry is a problem you will only explain the reason why the story shouldn't be necessary that is the life of soul is conduct its obedience is what was what church changed him and you know as he was looking the philistines were charging charging i don't know if he listens in your life they can only charge they cannot advance if god said wait you better wait don't do anything to help yourself because that may be the day god really wanted to establish wants to establish your kingdom by vindicating you before those philistines that was the plan ah the bible says saul he saw the philistines they kept coming close moving an inch every day then the people that we all around him started scattering and he knew that when the people become scattered he becomes naked himself that means he has lost jurisdiction he has lost control he's no longer in charge that would look like a pitiable condition that could make a man act under pressure we all find ourselves in those situations sometimes but don't forget the instructions wait did i wait upon the lord those that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings a son they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint teach me lord to wait let me trust your words above my environment when all around my soul gives way be my hope be my stay wait stand still and see the salvation of the lord don't act under pressure it could cause you beyond the immediate losses you see don't try to help yourself contrary to god's divine provision it can never abandon you wait saul never waited when he saw those things humanly speaking he had a reason to act but his action was beyond him you know what he did it took it upon himself to offer the sacrifice what somewhere wanted to do was an intercession to bring the presence of god down so they could defeat the enemy come on friends but it must be somewhere not soul saul couldn't wait he buckled under anxiety he buckled under pressure and he offered the sacrifice and it so happened that faith was unkind to him as he finished the offering someone came please why didn't somewhere come before that time what was somewhere waiting for church god must prove you [Applause] hallelujah god must prove you it doesn't entrust his gift into the hands of our materials you must be sent solid proven little light afflictions the utterances that come from the mouth of some of you even god will close his eyes in shame is this all i've produced for a child think on your ways i believe christian can still sing in tribulations to the believer it is always well never negative always positive think on your ways and somebody came and said so what did you do what are you doing if the people in philistines were coming upon me the people were leaving me and if i don't do something to create a running point the whole nation will be scattered this is what i did someone said what is this that you have done that thing paints somewhere so much until it was mourning for saul because for a man to be at the verge of a blessing a blessing into a permanent inheritance and to fritter it away somewhere mourn so much for saul until god had to come and ask my friend how long will you mom for saul get up now and go and do my work do you see the god you and i have is only the only way you can get god emotional is when you do what the world says are you listening to me someone said and it is just today now will god have established your kingdom permanently and you threw it permanently away saul saul he missed his blessing he misses inheritance it means an adoption you will see him in glory he will not be lost amen even when the witch of endor called him what someone saw said show that song wasn't lost he said you will be with me where i am somewhere wasn't in here but saul never came to what it should have been david took it learn a lesson we are looking at individual lives now learn a lesson from that some of us our ministries our life even our achievements became dwarfed we never come to what we should be it might be because of pride it might be arrogance it might be disobedience it might be prejudice it might be filthy lives a lot of us are never free from immoral living i think that is more powerful than the holy ghost might be lies see i repent yes you repent but sometimes it comes at the cost the cost won't take you out eternally apostle paul said it i will wind it up on him apostle paul said the bride will not be judged in glory amen but you know there is a future element of our own judgment the judgment of our works is in the scripture your works will be tried apostle paul said mind what you are doing he said the works of some can only be described as woods haze and stubbles white some are brass blondes some are silver and some are gold and they said the same chemical the same thing with try all fire for us to sit down which we stand and that which will not stand it's a judgment for rewards your soul is already saved you will make it you will live in eternity but a lot with misery watch because they miss their blessing there's going to be a reward time it could be around the wedding the marriage top of the lamb of three and a half years but the prophet testified that there was a great gathering of the saints up in glory how many ever read it equality dream a vision or something he said there was a great gathering and each person that has a price was being called and while he's been called to come and receive his prize the rest will be clapping and cheering him my it's going to be a great time in glory and he said when he was called william when he was called i don't know how it was maybe william brown or something he said he came out and as he was stepping toward his take his reward all of a sudden he felt something on the right when he looked it was over he felt something on the left when he looked it was middle the prophet started weeping he said it's a great blessing that the two women who associated with me in life are also with me next eternity to receive our rewards there is going to be a price-giving day church there is going to be a judgment of our work [Applause] let's do something for the lord let us excel he said doubt acceptable doubt excellent more than the daughters amen beyond your reasonable service do something for the lord conduct yourself right come into the wedge search what the word says search what it says for our song service for our worship service for every aspect of our service for our thinking should be how trusted should be how everything must be placed and in order search what the word of god says and take that position because this end time bride must approximate the wage completely think about that see it's it's it's it's so deep it's so it's so touchy i cannot leave it but david who was given that blessing to eventually become the one who was placed into that permanent inheritance so much that when you come into the millennium you will still be governed by the throne of david as long as there is time you will be under the throne of david how did david got it he went through the same challenge he saw heart but it was his conduct this is where the prophet said your conduct your obedience determines your blessing these words should not be in vain church let's let's study them let's pray our life into them let's search it daily thy whatever search before me always don't gloss over it and do contrary and with the spirit of god and the quickly realization of sonship you can never be tired of the world [Applause] i can give many experiences of david but let me give one and god typified it in that life david was anointed after saul after god took somewhere away from the mourning of saul isn't it he went to the house of jesus and anointed david it looked like god was in a hurry because this man that was anointed never came to the throne until eight years after he never took the throne of judah until about 80 years and he never took the entire throne of israel until seven more years making about 15 years the question is why was god in the hurry to anoint him enes of your inheritance there must be a witness to you who you are there was a witness to david i'm a king there must be a witness to you that you are the son of god and if you are a son you will rule and reign and he said right now as a foretest we are ruling we have dominion over sin over satan over flesh over disease over this world right now but we are still going to rule and reign more [Applause] we shall reign with him he must have the witness of who he is and god gave him witness now before between his witness and his blessing see what happened david went through the most of all trials god must prove you when the proven block your temptations are trials they've got nothing to do to you there is no enough problem on earth that can send you to hell take it from me you are a seed of god your eternity is certain and secured [Applause] no temptation no evil can send you to hell but god must allow them to prove you to mature you god does not it is the devil that tempts you temptation is to make you doubt who you are your sonship but the testing testing is to give you a proof that you are the son of god when you test you test with a positive mind let us be sure it is working isn't it but when you attempt you tempt with a negative mind to to flood the person into evil so god doesn't attempt a test because it's god to prove you it's going to prove your character he's got to try to train you all the curriculum that you have been taught there must be a practical aspect so that you become the total man and that was why god placed the man who killed david into his hand twice saul's intention was clear is to kill david he said so jonathan said so david knows so the back we read it all in the bible it declared it he has eliminated the son of jesus but here was the son of jesus being given the privilege to deal with his enemy twice with the way you know so do you think saul can be that careless it was a supernatural sleep god put him under anesthesia in order to test david come on friends you that somebody drove rough at you in the traffic and you want to get even with him you must do it but you are not ready for your placement you that are still tribal by gods a lot of tribal by gods in the message there's so much boost about a tribe or a country as if that country will be in eternity only christians will be in eternity [Music] [Applause] there's no tribe no nation under heaven that is good take it from me [Music] every nation has an evil spirit listen to me every nation you go to some places and say oh we are worried of these certain people as if they don't have their problem they have worse problems some may have a forward night defrauding syndrome some their immorality is out of this world is the same demon do you know why nations go to war the prophet says when those evil spirits of all nations get jealous among themselves they become envious of each other it's like you are doing too much damage and they go to war that's a spiritual that's a spiritual explanation for war so don't boast in those nonsense amen i am not a nigerian i don't know if you're a ghanaian i don't know if you're a trinidadian or an american whatever as long as you are one of such people you can never narrate the kingdom of god you are still flesh and blood heaven is only meant for evilness by the spirit of god i have i have changed citizenship a peculiar people hallelujah royal priesthood a holy nation [Applause] for any all the stones that built the temple of the great temple of solomon came from all the nations of the earth if they all came with their tribal national identities they will have no fitting place in the body they lost teach hallelujah and became one with the temple lose all your nationalities and become one with it with the temple with the body of christ i want a christian and nothing more let him be any tribe legend be any nation as long as he's a christian that's good enough for me because without that you cannot be pleased you go nowhere you say in this message of the hour can see people and people be like that they are all over everywhere so jaundice in their thinking may god help us church hallelujah you see why mark 11 said you can move your mountain if god will say amen it takes a son who is joining his narrative who is placing his blessings to be moving mountain but he said before you start moving your mountain if you have ought against any thoughtful manifestation comes with forgiveness a lot of you have unforgiving spirits and you want to come into adoption you won't be placed nowhere hallelujah he said if you have voted against any forgive look at david my for david to even get an evidence which is on one occasion he took the spear of the king that was at the bus of his head to show how close he came on another occasion he caught a garment for david to even cut that garment look at what the bible said he said is outsmart him cutting the garment of the anointed and that is a man who will kill him you that talk to god's anointed anyhow it is not the character of children of god it is the children of the other side that talk anyhow the speech of god's children preparing for their blessing is always seasoned it's a michael white disputing gabriel or michael white disputing over the body of moses did not uh micah did not bring a railing accusation he wasn't abusive on the devil he only said the lord rebuked it but you are becoming abusive you talking here you talk vulgar come on friends you don't even do that on the unbeliever not to talk of the lord's anointing michael never did that to satan as satanic as he was it's brought his art to cut the garment but he needed an evidence then finally the ziggler experience you remember it whatever happened let's leave it i want to cut it short so we can go but the fact was that when they came back from trying to help the philistines who were the landlords they met all their families already gone they learned everything they worked for wiped away those who are not ready for adoption started fighting and talking ready to stone david talking anyhow it was a time of pressure like solomon heart read that scripture nobody seemed to be for david again as great a person he was to them as great a leader has been they must have told him you mean i'm going to lose my wife and my children and not that i've ever worked for david get next to yourself you better do something about this otherwise i'll deal with you over 400 men we are praying on david to do something otherwise they will kill him tell me about pressure but what did the bible told me he said but david encouraged himself in the lord is god amen do you know what that means he began to remember the promises of god he began to remember the word of god he knows that even when everything fails the word cannot fail started saying don't worry brothers let's relax brother god is in control all will be well which all will be well which one will be where do we withdraw i need i want my wife and my children oh we'll be well calm down brother come down calm down when he got him to question down the beach you would think david will rise up and say let's go to one get our people not david the bride knows what to do with the world the gates don't share the lord or they keep still think about that you can be under such circumstances sometimes this is the character you must follow something's all hard but look at david the next thing they asked for bring me the effort another must have said is it a matter of effort is it a matter of the word now or preaching will not be switched until i see my wife and my children do something though i'm giving you time this stone in my hand must land on somebody today david now but this is what i thought about it the effort and the therapy is what the priest used to contact god to know his will david still wanted the will of god [Music] above any consideration in that terrible situation imagine what if god had said don't do anything about it leave it is my hand do you think david will do something he will have spoken like job of old the lord gave it the lord take it bless sir be his holy name even at the risk of his own life he will do what the word says your conduct around the world your obedience your attitude determines your placement [Music] [Applause] god hold no david so you know what push you overtake and recover or charge pursue overtake and recover all in the name of jesus christ let's stay with the wedge that is the condition for manifestation the two thomas give good remarks and as the world begin to walk upon the atoms of our body as we receive it coming under obedience it will be shaping us one day our father will look at us and see us perfectly reflecting him even in our smiles in our courage in our mean in our stature in our appearance and he said this one as for this one enter into your inheritance you are a son but be placing your position and through you a quick short work will be done in this world you won't live here quietly god must wave you god must vindicate you and then we shall go for a total change and ever be with our lord shalom to the bread of christ god bless [Music] you [Music] for your name is holy holy [Music] lord for your name is holy for your name is holy
