this wonderful spirit and a meaning I know it comes from you so I pray father that you'll continue to honor the meeting tonight with your presence and heal all the sick and inflicted granted may this be a great night that will not forget soon because of your presence we ask that in Jesus name amen amen praise God I want to apologize for keeping so late last evening I will try to be faster tonight and just so we can hurry up and and pray for the sake I certainly felt good about last night's meeting it seemed like that there was many people got here and I had plenty of support everybody praying and together that's the way we stand so the Lord bless you now I think tomorrow night we're to be I guess they've already announced that it's another another place all right now let's turn into Book of Numbers the 22nd chapter a right quick for uh just a little text to pass a few comments and then we'll go to place them most of the time in the prayer line Billy said he gave out enormous amount of cars two three hundred of them and it'll take quite a while to get them through the prayer line so I I will just speak for a few minutes not over 30 minutes if possible and then uh start the prayer line pray for the sake and Deuteronomy and pardon me a number is 22nd chapter and the 31st verse I wish to read this and the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face now this may sound like a rude little hex or uh just a to give a stand and to have our healing service and I'm going to try to have a prayer line started by nine o'clock if possible now I want to take the subject tonight does God change his mind you know we can change our mind and because we we learn a little different we know we were wrong but I don't believe that God can change his mind because if he does then he certainly uh could not be infinite and he can make a better decision if he would change it so he the faith that I have in him that that he doesn't change his mind because if God ever makes the decision he has to stay with that decision I think and each time the same problem comes up he's got to act in the same way he did the first time or he acted wrong in the first time see so it gives us somewhere to have a basic Faith now we cannot yes Faith isn't just a loose leaf something that you can fly at ear and over somewhere else it's something that's got to be sure it's got to be stable and now I cannot base my faith upon some Theory it's got to be a proven back before I can have faith like a man choosing a wife to marry while he he's got to have faith in that woman he marries her he certainly is fixing himself for a lot of trouble so he's uh got that you got to have faith Some solid facts some Faith the base of upon upon her word upon what somebody else has said or something he's got to have something to place his face on faith on so I feel that to meet God there's just one thing that I can base my faith upon and that's his word because we have different ideas for near all of us we'd sit down and go to even talk about something to eat while we were different on something to eat and we made different our appetites are different and therefore it makes our churches we see they are different in their ideas of what's right and what's wrong that gives us everyone a privilege to take a choice but to me uh I believe that the word of God is right now I don't believe it's of any private interpretation I believe it's just what it says that's the truth and that's why I take it just on the basics of it being the word of God and I haven't got faith enough maybe to make all of it Act but I certainly wouldn't want to stand in the way of somebody who did have faith enough to make an act like for instance Enoch had enough faith that he didn't have to die just took an afternoon stroll and got tired here on Earth it's walked on up to heaven I'd certainly like to have faith like that but I hope that we do get that Faith someday as we grow on into him our reason I chose this place because it seems like that here to me is one all the places in the Bible that would spear a critical place for the text tonight because it looks like that God did change his mind and told Balaam one thing to do and then told him something else to do so I thought maybe just for a while we try to straighten this out just a little and see what he really told him so now uh to outline this we know that Balaam was a a prophet and balik was the king of Moab at the time and they were not infidels up at Moab they served the same God that Israel served because moeb the nation was founded by Lots a son by his daughter and so they serve the same God if you notice their sacrifices and everything was just exactly the same Bullocks and also the Rams speaking uh the second coming and now if uh fundamentalism is all that God requires then Moab or just as fundamental in his offering as what Israel was but we find them now Israel is in the line of following the word of God to a land that have been promised them and they come here would be a type of the natural and spiritual meaning and when the natural and spiritual meets there's always a collision because they run right head on into each other and Israel here would I want to represent it as a spiritual church and Moab as the natural church just the church what we call Church natural and we're all sure that there is a a church and there is a bride coming out of that church we know that that is true and they Clash here and we notice that when they Clash here it come under something that I would like to speak a moment on as soon as they clashed in one scene what the other was doing there was a great impersonation one or the other and that's where we find it today that we do get too much impersonations and when you do that you're always in trouble you cannot live the other fellow's life we cannot impersonate something we must be just what we are you must never try to if this fellow does something because he does it you think you have to too you don't do that you're an individual to God and we mustn't try to impersonate each other and now Israel right in the line of duty marching on their way to a commandment our commandment of God to a promised land they clash with Moab another group of believers and uh I hope this doesn't sound too bad but the little illustration I want to make here is Moe have been settled down in a land he was more like an organized Affair he had his celebrities and his uh uh dignitaries of the of his kingdom but Israel was just a a Wanderer they had no certain place they went they just wandered as the Lord LED them I believe also Balaam later in his prophecy said that people would not be among the Nations it would just be a scattered and that's what it's always been and we find out the Clash Come Just As Cain and Abel they also came together in a collage and then being a brothers and both of them of the same mother Eve and we find that they realize that they were mortal and they had been put out of life out of the garden of life and they both were trying to find a way to get back in there and if you notice both boys was very religious teen was just as religious as Abel was and they both built altars otherwise a church that both made sacrifice they both prayed and they they served God both of them but one of them served him wrong I see you can be ever so sincere and yet be wrong you could be wrong there is a way to seemeth right but the in thereof is the ways of death now we we see that this is so true with Cain and Abel and when they seen Cain saw that Abel's sacrifice was received and I might stop here to say why did God receive uh his sacrifice is because that that he was by a revelation he understood that it was not apples or I believe that now they got the pomegranates or something that they eat in the Garden of Eden that the caused sin and he found Adam or I mean Abel believed that if it was blood which it really was and Abel by Revelation Faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified but he was righteous see in the whole church is built upon a divine revelation of the word of God the whole Jesus said so one day coming down off the mountain he said to his disciples who do you see are the son of man am or who does people say I am and some of them said well your Moses your Elias or one of the prophets he said but who do you say I am and Peter made that great statement Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas and here is the great argument amongst Believers now the Catholic Church says that there he he built his church upon Peter or said that Peter a little Stone upon this Stone little Stone I'll build my church well now the Protestant mostly believe that it was upon himself that he built upon him the Cornerstone but you see he was the Cornerstone to the building I believe that what he built a church upon not to be different but you see the question was who does man say I am and Peter said the art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou silence son of Jonas Flesh and Blood never reveal this to you you never learned this by going to a seminary see you never learned this for some uh man-made Affair but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you upon this rubber I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it the spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word let it be the spiritual revealed truth of the word is exactly where the church rests I think that's what Abel had at the beginning a spiritual Revelation that it wasn't the fruit of the field or the works of our hands or so forth it was blood and he offered uh to God a more excellent sacrifice than than caned in we find in Abraham and lot the same thing in a choice because lot went down when the time come when the spiritual and the and the natural Church come in a clash because of the herdsmen they had to separate one for another and whenever this does it sets up a jealousy we find out that Abel be because God had received him and he did not receive Kings beautiful big offering in your toils the hard part was religious and bowed down and worshiped and so forth done everything that Abel did only he didn't have the revelation of what was the truth so we find out that when God accepted Abel's uh Revelation and his offering it made King get jealous of Abel and there was the first murder we find out that jealousy become between the herdsmen of Abraham and lot and they had to separate we find out that Moses and clorah had a clash also Jesus and Judas had a clash and as ever it's been the same thing and so is it today the natural church and the spiritual church has a clash when they come together now the natural tries to match the spiritual always with a carnal impersonation but as it was with Esau and Jacob it will not work God has his church called named set aside and in the ages she lives in he'll reveal himself to her each and every time just as he said in Romans 8 chapter that the foreknowledge of predestination of God might stand sure King uh being Esau and Jacob before either boy was born before they even had a chance to make a choice God said I hate Esau and love Jacob or he knew what was in them from the beginning and we know we're in keep that in mind he knows what's in your heart he knows what you mean no matter what we say he knows what you mean and it's always cause trouble and they uh the always the natural always tries since teen destroyed Abel the natural has always tried to destroy the effects of the spiritual we find it the same thing today the very same thing today it proves that it comes from Satan because it's jealousy and impersonation of Truth so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he says he always keeps the truth but he has a permissive will now there were the trouble leads we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will there's nothing will go wrong with God where he knows just where the clocks are taken at tonight there's nothing wrong every lick is hidden just exactly the way it should be everything we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's forced to be like this like at the beginning God just permitted he did not that wasn't his perfect will but you see God the great spirit the father in him was attributes and these things that you see displayed now and just his attributes being displayed he dwelt alone he was not even God God was an object of worship he was a great Eternal one and in him was attributes such as to be father to be savior to be healer and now how could he first he had to be father because it proves he was father but he dwells alone he alone is Immortal and now but his attributes has to be displayed now to be a savior there has to be something lost and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it it wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and his great uh a judgment but he put man on free moral agency knowing that man would fall and in that then he became man himself in order to redeem Batman that fell that's the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel if God sent another person besides himself then that wouldn't be just God had to come himself and take place and God could not be come down in spirit and take place he had to be made flesh In the Flesh of his own creative son and he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create Man Out of the Dust of the Earth but you see he permitted sex to be brought him he never did intend children to be born by sex but it was permitted which soon will fade away now we find out that Moab was a illegitimate to begin with because it was lots Son by his own daughter now notice as the natural Church Moab represents the natural Church boy a dozen Israel the spiritual church now Israel the bride was the represents the called out the church itself the word church means called out one come out those who have come out come out of her my people be separated and saith the Lord and I will receive you unto my self-touch not their unclean things the Church of God is called out of the world out of the chaos of the world you're no more of the world as I was trying to say the other night to you it's uh when you know that you have the earnest of your of your Eternal Redemption right now in You by the baptism of the holy spirit it's already quickened you you are now risen with him and we're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see you're no more of the world if you love the world and your affections are still on the things of the world then the love of God's not even in you see we are from free from the world there's no more desire in the Hebrews I believe the 10th chapter said uh there was a continually remember it's a sin each year those BEAST's body was offered but in this case the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin no more desire to sin the whole thing is gone from you because you have been quickened into a new life and then the church naturally just defeat bunch of people and denominations to join it's no more I don't even know more call it church I don't like to refer to it I like to refer to it as a lodge Methodist Lodge Baptist Lord Pentecostal Lodge but the churches are born again it's in Christ Jesus that's new creatures and so we still see that that God keeps his word now a mole seen Moab looked down upon the field in seeing God moving amongst this people who was not even an organized Nation they were just floating around from place to place but the strange thing that they come upon these nations and they took them everything was in the road they took them down they found out more looking up on it Bailey he looked down upon the nation of Israel and he said the people cover the whole face of the Earth he said in the lick up the Nations it's like an ox licking up grass and they found out one of the great Keynotes was that how they got this great Revelation there was a prophet among them they had a prophet now someone that led them it wasn't a man-made system like he was used to uh is is delegations with him and so forth but it was in his dignitaries but they had a leader a Divine call leader and oh what a sad day it was when the church World left off the Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost and adopted a bishop or anything else to take its way it was a sad day the holy spirit is to be the leader of the church he is sent to confirm the words of Jesus Christ to make the church live as it did live at the beginning not long ago a very famous uh School here in in this city uh Seminary and uh they have one in Phoenix and one of the men or a couple of the students was came down to me and said uh we like you brother Branham we don't have nothing in you at all but we just like to straighten you out and I said well I sure want to be straight in that hustle and so I said if I'm wrong I certainly don't want to be wrong I'll talk to too many people and um he said well here's your trouble said you are trying to introduce or to make live again an Apostolic religion when the apostolic religion ceased with the apostles and um I said yes sir I said well now if he said I wouldn't debate it with you I said I wouldn't either we don't we're not supposed to do that we're Brethren and he said well he said I would just like to help you I said I'm certainly willing to get help and he said um now you see he said now the uh uh that's true and I said now on talking we mustn't use uh textbooks I said I won't use mine I had none but this one but so so but I said I won't use textbook just the Bible and you we just use the Bible it's all right I said now we believe that the Apostolic Church began at the day of Pentecost do you agree with that he said yes I do I said now we realize that God gave the church power there for these Apostolic movements he said yes that was the framework of the church now the church is already set in the order and we got over pastors and our great organizations and things we don't need those things anymore to draw people I said now where does the bible say that I said you tell me where the Bible says that at and he said well it doesn't exactly say that in that way I said well then I can't receive it lest it says it just in that way now I said we're I said that's where it has to be I said do you believe that God's still calling people he said yes sir I said now you will believe that the Bible is correct ever answer yeah I said now the spokesman at the day of Pentecost was Peter who had the keys to the kingdom that's right now I said now whatever his decision was Jesus said what you bind on Earth I bind in heaven once you're loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven said I'll believe that I said now in Acts the second chapter 38 verse Peter said to those people who were marbling these people speaking in unknown tongues and uh they asked him what they could do to be saved and he said repeat everyone if you'd be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for their ambitious sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't he you and to your children and to them it's for all even as many as the Lord Our God shall call now God's still calling that same problem is for them well he come over here with one of Billy Graham's groups up here praying for a meeting and a group of them sitting up here in California somewhere a few weeks ago in real deep sincere prayer consecrated to God fasting in the Holy Ghost fell on the whole bunch and begin to speak in other tongues and member of the of the Friendly Church the Assemblies of God in Tucson Arizona he said oh brother random or go up there and feel so good so just raise back my hands and said the glory of God I just sang and said I never could do that in the New Testament Baptist Church I said I see you can but you're out so there you are see God keeps his word what he says he'll do it God has to keep his word now we find out here that this carnal impersonation that boy have had he saw this Prophet among Israel that was able to bless curse lead and so forth so he tries to match it by politics now that's just what's taken place in the churches today they have tried to match it with some kind of a system you can't do it the Holy Spirit must be alive in the church always leading the church for the age that it's living in to confirm the word his promise for that age God spoke the word from the beginning and it's so much for this age and so much for that age and certain for them age it always happens just that way and seeing the Holy Spirit must be alive in the church to make this church live its day it must be here today to confirm this Latter-Day Ministry latter days signs Latter-Day pour out of the Holy Ghost it's just got to be here to do that and you cannot get it through the working of systems God has the system he is the one who's give us the Holy Spirit now we know to sure that Moses had a king and that King was God that anointed him and Balaam also was under a king Bailey and it was more like a political setup see balik Balaam a prophet of God he went to balak for his information Moses went to God for information there was a difference yet both of them are prophets because they were both called of God both met God both talked to God and both Spirit-filled I'm coming Holmes now they were both Spirit-filled man now that is true the Bible said that God met with them and talked with him see so we noticed each one of these prophets both of them being prophets man of God they catered to their headship Moses catered to God and Balaam here tailored to Bailey notice sure and typing the spiritual and the natural how perfect it was Moses sent by God in a line of duty is met and challenged by another man of God could you imagine such but look what a set up they had up there it was an organized Nation and Moses was leading the children of Israel just as God would tell them where to go led by a pillar of Fire and a supernatural being that was leading the way and Moses was getting his information through the logus of course it went out of God that pillar afar which was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the anointed one and he was getting his message there and giving it to the children of Israel on the road to a Promised Land but this man was all settled down and he had his kingdom he had his churches he had everything right there in order so he sent order to get this man to come over and to curse this people and notice could you imagine that one Prophet one man of God seeing the works of God with another man and try to to challenge that works of God when he knew until no better now Balaam uh first when balik sent to him and told him come over and curse this people now balik done the very thing another done the thing that was right he sought God he's thought God first now that's what he ought to have done and then God Gidding is Perfect Clean Cut answer don't go with him leave him alone don't you curse those people they are blessed now that ought to be enough When God says anything he cannot change that notice his perfect will was don't you go don't attack that people they're my people that was his perfect will but Salem didn't like those people to begin with see there you are how many valence do we have today same thing they know better they had them in the days of our Lord Jesus Nicodemus come and said Rabbi we know you're a man sent from God or or a teacher sent from God no man could do the things that you do unless God was with him see they knew it there was a Balaam against it Balaam didn't like the people notice his headquarters after they sent some fine man over there to tell him now there's some people coming up down here and I understand that you're a prophet you're a great man so you come up here and curse this people Balaam said now you wait a minute uh go in and pray and stay all night maybe the Lord will meet me and you'll tell me all right the next morning the Lord met with him and said don't go don't curse those people they're blessed all right balen went out and said well I can't go because the Lord told me not to go now notice when they went back and took the headquarters for him to go down there and stop this meeting they had you see well then come to find out the headquarters sent a better set of people higher dignitaries maybe a bishop somebody else or might have been a state president or somebody sent down there tell him to go down stop that anyhow see it notice is better influential group better gifts more money said I can exalt you to a better position I might make the instead of just in an ordinary man I can make you a little higher and I have the right to do that because I'm King here in this great movement and um I can do something better for you if you'll just do it notice the new offer blinded him he ought to have known what God Said God will do but it blinded him and as a prophet of God he should have not been influenced by such a group he should have got out of that group to begin with and if I'm talking to some man of God here when they try to tell you at the headquarters that the days of Miracles is passing this what we're doing here in the Lord Jesus is blessing us and that's a bunch of fanaticism work up and emotion there's no such a thing as Divine Healing get out of that group right there get out of it because it's the word of God being made manifest they say there's no such a thing as Apostolic days there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost that's speaking in tongues is nothing to it they're old but brother don't you listen to that there's a many one like balen today sitting back in their office reading these books of the Bible and know that it's the truth but yet just because of Physician's sake they won't take their stand just exactly right notice God he knew he shouldn't have been in this group or Balaam I should have known they they get out of the will of God then tell us a talk here out of the will of God when you find the will of God don't let nobody talk it out of it I know the good people come to the meetings get healed and go back and they'd say oh well there's nothing to do that you're just worked up and there's nothing good and the people go to doubting I see people come and receive Christ in their heart go back maybe speak in tongues and go back to the church and say why you're you're a disgraced to Christianity and so forth and oh my don't don't do that see it get out of that group stay away from them notice Balaam used a Brawny texture for his conscience in he uh said for adventure you stay another night and maybe I'll ask God you see maybe he might have changed his mind but God don't change his mind when God gave us a declaration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost that's the way he has to keep it he did All Through the Bible age and he will any other time that man will come up on them bases that he offered there if you'll come believing repenting being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and believing on God God's obligated to fulfill that prescription right because he's the doctor and he'll fulfill it if you will if you will obey it but you can't afford now they'll try to get this prescription taken order some quack druggist that that might put something else in it it might kill the patient that's the reason we got so many dead church members today they're trying to give the wrong prescription God's got the prescription right here in the Bible [Music] you've got to take the medicine the way the doctor said give it the Bible said is there no is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there of course there is so then why is the daughter of my people in this condition see we got the Bible we got the physician it's just the druggist is miskilling the scripture prescription that's what it is you're trying to say the days of Miracles this past there's no such a thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost and all these Saints it's nonsense the Bible is exactly right God doesn't take back anything he said and they try to use a Brawny way out something another like well we believe that well now no matter what you believe it's what God said he said I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh he promised this in the last day they try to say the meeting that you're seeing they call me a soosayer a polished up soosayer or a Beelzebub or some devil well they got to say that because they're the father that's what he said about Jesus at the beginning and it's not I'm doing this anyhow it's saying Jesus because he's the same yesterday today and forever it's his Spirit oh something that could pass bypassing for bypass his commission so many people try to bypass that oh come join the church and it'll be all right we're an old church we've been here for many years we started yes that's right if that's so then the Roman Catholic church has got to own all of you they're the first of the organizations Dave was first but remember not the first church that is the first organization and the mother of every one of them whichever one of them is contrary to God Revelation 17 says the same thing yes we are in the last days now remember God will let you go see now and then Balaam he thought well then God told him go on why God knew what was in his heart God knew that was in his heart to begin with so he told him to go on he will permit it he will permit you to do it he will bless you many times in doing it he blessed even Israel and to the grace that already given Prophet Pillar of Fire a Deliverance signs and wonders brought him out of Egypt and everything and yet they wanted them all God let them have it but he cursed them all the time he let Balaam go on just the way he's supposed to but what did he do he went down there and instead of cursing the people he had to bless the people he could not curse what God had blessed and I I told you to go to quit at nine and I looked up and it's time now and I got a book full of notes here but I want to say this in closing that God never changed his mind his direct will was for Balaam not to go and when God makes a statement it has to ever remain true now the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now that don't mean in a certain way that means he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said in Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also is that right he promised in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe they say well that was just for the apostles he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them in all the world into every creature in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it wouldn't harm them yet they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover now that is his qualification see we try to qualify something we are trying to make it qualify the church to what we think God's word is we can't qualify to the church we've got to qualify to God I've always said it's a great match in time you paint your step thread watch your neighbor paint Israel some of you women wear certainly kind of hat at church what's the rest of women get that Miss Jackson Kennedy had this sir water head haircut and look at all the women she wanted them to those sack colored aprons or things like that it's a scandalous for the woman to be on the street with a stretch Stone like that look at all the women doing the same thing it's an impersonation but that's in the world the church people picked it up and it's a shame that they do it it's wrong for him to do it it's a disgrace and when we see it creeping into Pentecost it's more disgraceful that is right but you see the church puts up with it and lets it go now we don't care I never cared whether my Coke match my trousers or my time that's my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible and his requirements and that's what we as Pentecostal people ought to do is have our experience just like theirs was because he's the same Jesus the Same Holy Ghost the same power he's living today and he lives Among Us it kind of reminds me of one day his mother had gone off from Jerusalem from the worship and his foster uh daddy Joseph and they went three days journey and is presuming that he was along with him and they found out that he wasn't there and you know I want to liken that today you know the church has had a three-stage journey Luther Wesley Finnegan three-stage Journey God will give him a message justification Luther you handle on to it then comes sanctification through Wesley then the baptism the holy spirit with Pentecost and I wonder if we didn't get off all on a big tantrum somewhere to build big things and do great things like Balaam had in his mind great organizations the one to outrun together and this and the more giving gold medals and Stars for Sunday school who could bring in the most members and taking us to anything into the church I'll tell you this one church is not a hypocrite in that's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ that's baptized by the Holy Ghost you're not persuaded in there you're born in there you're sent in there by the Holy Spirit they found out the parent found out that he wasn't among them now in this hour this great crisis is on when we know that this nation is shaking not only the nation but the world is shaking it's at the end time there's not another thing that I know to happen but the Rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's already and we see these gatherings all get every benefit this convention coming up get everything out of it you can get that's of God if you haven't got the Holy Ghost just put it in your mind you're not going to leave here until you get it that's the way to do it stay there because you this is might be your last opportunity they may never be another convention on this West Highway it may be beneath the sieve at that time for another one so we don't know what's going to happen so we we're looking for the judgments of God to come up on the Nations now may I say this they thought he was alone but they found out in the crisis that he wasn't he wasn't with them now we find out that in the time that when this great thing has been brought up and we find out that we're missing something in our churches and that is the power of Christ now look I don't want to criticize I love you and genuine true love always is corrective now we're a missing Christ in our church we're missing Christ amongst our Pentecostal people our brother and sisters there's something wrong the old-fashioned prayer meetings he used to have all day and night they don't have it no more our women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore it would be a disgrace for women to paint and use paint back in the early days and act the way these women do something went wrong nothing wrong with Christ see but something went wrong something is somewhere the pulpit used to what a permitted such a thing as that but it does now see the crisis is on him we're missing something we're missing power that we ought to have whether the big machine ought to be running up in great signs and wonders well this feeling ought to be set and so full of power of God now to a sinner couldn't stay in here the Holy Spirit condemning it right quickly like that like ananias and surprised and we're missing something now what happened they went to look for him amongst her kinfolks and they didn't find him amongst their kin folks so where did they find him right back where they left and I think when our church got on this great organizational spree that we had the one had to out do the other and had to have a bigger churches and better class of people and better dress people and better singers and stand up there and I like good singing I like real good old-fashioned Pentecostal singing but I cannot stand that put on stuff that just simply don't go with me hold your breath to your blue in a face just to be heard I've even singing from your heart in the spirit of God like a hurting here a while ago I like good old-fashioned shouting but I think shouting and go on this that the music's going on or not the spirit of God upon the people it brings down the blessings and power of God I believe man can testify and sing and praise God at their work wherever they are truly and we're missing something where will we find him right or are we lifting in the word let us pray dear heavenly father one of these nights we're going to close this Bible the last time the last song is Going to Be Sung last sermon preached the last prayer line will be called the last sinner who will come in and then what oh dear God we don't want your permissive will father let us walk to your perfect will let us this does not take a word here and there and make it to fit a Dogma or a Creed or something let us take the word as it is believing the Full Gospel all that Jesus taught for us to do we do not believe that the Acts of the Apostles is just a framework we believe it's the word of God it's the acts of your Holy Spirit in the apostles and we believe that the same Holy Spirit Lord that come upon them and the way they acted it'll do the same thing in us when it comes up on us if it's the same spirit so I pray dear God that this condition that we're just on the eve of it the start tomorrow night I pray heavenly father that will be the greatest convention that this city has ever had because of your presence bless each speaker oh God may it be so so shaking May the wrath of
