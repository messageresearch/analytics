the comment of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and heart of the children to their fathers he's I come and smite the earth with a curse mature tree was 16 and 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice in heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Matthew chapter 17 and after six days Jesus they could Peter James and John his brother and bringing them up unto an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them his face would shine as the Sun is raiment as white as the light and behold he appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him

you're trying to get Son some marquetry to graduate to Matthew 17 where is not just this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased but three more words are added here he him father son please in a position of authority and power and that son has to be a son that has your character that has your nature that has your life Lord your prophet taught us that power with our character is satanic and we know by the word that you look at the Trice's and prove sons to bring them into a place of adoption help us tonight as we approach your word help us tonight and we invite your Holy Spirit to bring insight divine revelation inspiration upon your word speak to every heart here tonight confirm the word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name Amen and amen you may be seated as I give the Lord some worship [Music] it's a title tonight the restoration of the person of Christ by Malachi for Oh blessed be the name of the Lord the restoration of the person of Christ by Malachi 4 and Sunday we were talking about this a small recap the days where the Pentecostal even made a mistake we think as soon as we become sons and daughters that settles it we just come into a place of trying the Methodist said as soon as I shouted the Lutheran said to believe on my feet no matter what kind of position God put you in you are still growing you are still going on to perfection isn't that right now remember the Holy Spirit has got to bring God everything that every professing Christian see about it so that means that the Son of God Jesus when he got off the water he began to be tried and tested and her son isn't that right he said what are you preaching that for brother branham i want to see the church of god in deep sincerity i want to see the old-fashioned prayer meetings i want to see the times they can't leave the church they want to stay all night and pray and fast and call out till God answers instead of that it's in the love of dwindled away from us the love of God now he spoke about a negative when the son didn't behave himself but he says what if the boy then then he is still a son now we not talking about sip-and-see we not talking about force anointed once we're not talking about false prophets we're not talking about second Timothy heady and high-minded lovers of Prayer we're not talking about that we are still speaking about sons and daughters of God sons and daughters of God not evil people not evil workers not shocked we're talking about sons and don't owe me less than a tonight we are not talking about negative we're only talking about the bride the sons are born of God rather I want to say the sons and daughters of God now watch this now now this is the boy if he come up the way and didn't what the not obedient did not have the action of his father did not carry his father's business on the way his father did then that child missed all its inheritance another brother had two tickets please that's a powerful one now today if we try to take the church before God under common creed we all believe the same thing read some scripture or theology that's not the way Jesus took the church before the Father God wants the church these depart we have to kick with how God wants to church no man have it now hope people like it no but how God wants it God wants the church before God what God wants the church to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's what will not you come and just get baptized that you come and occupy up you let you come and shake the pastor's hand I get up a free Bible no that's not what he wants he wants the church filled with the Holy Ghost let me say Amen he won the church filled with the Holy Ghost watch watch doing the same work that he did when he was here on earth that's the kind of church that the teacher the Holy Spirit will want to present before God he don't want to say we just gathering he want to say we have the same life the same science the same wonders this church looking like it ready to take off this church looking like it ready for the rapture Express that's the kind of church is coming for that just could only have 12 people in a hundred it will have that fifty people from said the church stood original we wouldn't have more than fifty but the people read blood wash and the word will be spoken word by word by word [Music] Oh hallelujah hallelujah know what Isaac we Sunday evening the guy with the flag and he's going under the hearts of the enemy and the people who are losing the battle and they said bring back the flag ease and will bring up the man hallelujah that's what we needed stop lowering the standard bring up the man raise a standard there's gonna be a perfect judge my Devils walk the earth there's gonna be sons and daughters of the Living God I don't care what child I've been through him and that's the thing what we'll do to his sons on it someday he will call you a side Church if you will obey Him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church and that's what we have to look for he will please into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will please into the church all the power that Christ had in him will be in the church hallelujah all of us and God he poured the crying all I was in Christ he poured into the church isn't that right the father one of the work done he poured in her son the son wanna work Danny ported into the church and what the same power that rest in Jesus Christ rests in placed sons in the body of Christ that means that they're gonna be some sons that will be placed not by a convention not by man but by God himself he will call you a side of a son this is my beloved son there's a lot some precious people Oh hallelujah hallelujah this has nothing to do with Baptist Methodist your witness this has nothing to do with the Pope and the Catholic Church I'm gonna do with any part of the world this is gorgeous son or give the Lord a shout of praise Oh hallelujah are you with me now placing him in a position isn't that right his son is a position isn't that right and then he said here this prophesy he said a very simple watch place him in a son take him out in a sitting place have a ceremony before angels please in positionally here what he is in the body of Christ then that son has the authority let me see this if you caught me to be a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power prophecy coming to the church and now it's coming in prophecy that the Holy Spirit prophecy will so anoint the people they will speak the word prophecy and it will create itself right there prophecy we haven't seen power like this coming in the church I know it for a fact see under this mountain pulled out any heart but believe what you said shall come to pass the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church the critics mutt will be shut it will be a short hand it won't last long but it will be here oh that's what I Wallen on do tonight by these promises I'm holding on to these promises every promise I can find I'm picking it up it belongs to me it belongs to you it belong to the sons and daughters of God that there was trying to cover it up all these years but the angel said seal not the sayings of the prophecy of the book because the time is at hand Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated let's go for the swords in prison though not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in spirit not by joining church not by fruit of the Spirit Christian science had cutouts more than any of you in that and even 90s was divine it's the word living there it is if the only look he was the Messiah he was here we go live in word made manifest or the word made manifest is Messiah and a man that's got the Spirit of God in him or woman lives that word writes out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the will of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people you're mean the word Allah comes to the elect yes the word of the Lord comes to the bride yes the word Allah will come to you Oh Camille is it now listen to this bum he said no

little flock positionally stay where you are our sister Gertie said use a sing keep holding on don't worry quarters waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to the church that is what is hauling back the coming of Christ and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church question if Christ is to come and he is waiting for this supernatural power that lays dormant in this church only when that power is activated it brings an attraction to Christ Oh hallelujah is almost like an outerspace business that we have something

written for somebody to find somebody is not too unusual to that they can be anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so you mean the anointing of the Holy Ghost it was have to come to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever they were so far this theological intellectual intellectual ecology mastics flippin here and flippin near is irrelevant to the mystery of God to be expressed you would so far it is from the real thing because the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God but then something happened and the word became flesh and kalamarez that was the mystery of God being revealed Oh hallelujah or glory to God not the mystery coming more mystery no but the mystery coming in simplicity that the way becoming flesh and dwell among us Oh hallelujah hallelujah all the profit was summarized in the person called Jesus Christ and although Michigan be summarizing you cuz you're

patience godliness brotherly kindness that will be the say up to your feet because it is a revelation if it is what's revealed to you but you're gonna add to your faith virtue and knowledge and temperance you're gonna be like the lily oh man the pun is stink filters coming down your way every day all tires all oiled on the River of Life all kind of negative or kinda lust demon sex favorite naked woman you name it it's coming down but you were like the lily and you you press your way hallelujah you and you in filthy water but you are not that water come on out but what no no no no no you

tonight both morally glory glory all glory to God amen [Applause] so the fullness is charged you to come down I'd like the seed of the fullness of the capstone revelation of Jesus Christ in your heart which is the 707 tons of the seed and the world and message will reject that 7 Thunder baby ho glory that God didn't like how it come didn't like what it was about hallelujah cause it gives you faith the bride guys are prior together who and sure how to repair isn't that right you're gonna alter the bride isn't that right inside they have a new name isn't that right it's not about transforming power well let me drop this bomb on you read but the restoration of the person comes the restoration of virtue power for service because in the person have power Oklahoma enough Christ come among us you know you know you're gonna be here right you know you're gonna be see right you know you're really living right tonight remember Justice John the Baptist he came in an in-between age there was the all optimal acai there was no prophets isn't that right Messiah was promised and in between there they had a history of Sadducees scribes Pharisees Saints all of them bunch of interpretation theology traditions and they were set in their ways for many many years John getting a different name from the Levi's and all different kind of Jewish names he get John Gollum John God wanted that name John not one that is tables myself does in him though he wasn't only regular kind like SE kya Jeremiah Zachariah you know different kind of things they call it John but John under let the name alone trouble them hallelujah John is wrong where John and then next God said criminal illness you have a passion for the witness wide descriptor say voice of one crying over the nest so caught with a wilderness corpulent wilderness rugged land written willingness honey man and bees and honey whatever it is wilderness man to come out to the wilderness and say repent because the kingdom of heaven is at hand Oh John was rocking them and shaking them up he was bringing something different they expected something to go in continuity with what was there before John was interrupting it was an interruption praise God it was a hallelujah praise go with a seal about the break I see you see the spiritual interruption Church interrupted challenge rockin and Chum that Judge just in commenting introduce Messiah I went at thought he was hot these levers one stunning among you that man you're gonna baptize you but the holy was on fire if you think I just come to do something that is a small I'm not worried to unloose issues but command power coming the glory common dynamic is coming Oh Hal equipment powers come I can feel it tonight it's coming it's here the dynamics is here and so at a mechanics if we could just get started I hope you get started tonight I hope you rise up and begin to anoint your promises to yourself tonight Oh glory to God glory glory glory glory all right let's go my events maker my prophecy you were genome your father and you were in your father yet your father had no philosophy new so in jean form there is no fellowship but watch what there was a betting ground he was mighty manifested you that you could have fellowship at you say in a nutshell you're in the gene of your father and then to a womb isn't that right spill Manette come together you become Express manifests and when they become expression still get fellowship yet until they grow up until I can walk and talk and guild words it's not right and the same where we were in his genes we went in stores we couldn't have fellowship with our Father so he make us bypass or theophany drop us down on earth and send him son gonna come out in the age in season in that dispensation and we are going to have fellowship raises people know I want to get to it but Luther was in the womb yes he was in the womb even the Pentecostal was in the womb that's like a mistress could be made known to them so therefore God cannot fellowship with them because they were in the womb but when Malachi 4 came he came to release the entering of bat that we could be born in this hour that we could grow up in the soul the quarter said this is my son these is born or gives a lot some praises corner Hassan fellowship or glory hallelujah but apropos you know I'm saying that that's the next quote right here that do if I got it it's right here question and answers yeah when you use the expression if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish version will live eternally but D will be separated from the New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the brain here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the Scripture speaks of being born again it is a question if the natural but requires water blood and spirit does the spiritual boot requires all three stages of grace before the boost is truly born again he said absolutely he says absolutely I just explained that this morning you've got to have all stages you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the mother's womb but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost you were born damn you are not converted you are in the process of being converted until that time here we go that's the reason that all these great mysteries could not be given to loser could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the ears that just passed by us Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten now the person of Christ himself the son of I'll reveal himself in human flesh it could not have come tell that so therefore quad was weighted with a special Brad age to bring on the mysteries hallelujah to the science it's not right he says now he said justification my feet was a white sphere and we never move from that Along Came Wesley John Wesley shook them down and down and brought her down to sonification live a good clean life Sammy fight by the Word of God give joy in your heart that shook a lot of Lutheran doctrine then Along Came the Pentecost with the baptism of Holy Ghost that narrow down again and the gifts and the restoration and the Spirit of God had come in in the fullness of sand and one is into the church and that shook Pentecost what is it we are so close to the coming of Jesus until a high here we go people talking about the Trump and talk about the commander Lord but Restless we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus watch until the very same spirit that was in him is working in the church not more agents it has to move from with the spirit we have to see the spirit itself beginning to work hallelujah watch watch until work in the church do it doing the very same things he did that he was young good it's never been anywhere back from the time of the Apostles until this time why it's narrow it known what is it there we go just like your hand coming to a shadow negative negative well it's a reflection what was luta so he put luta as a reflection on your hand as they get nearer it coming closer to the real thing is not right it isn't that right the shadow blending it with the real thing so watch what was looted our reflection at Christ what was basically are you French deny Christ but we are the end time each man looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ but it had to look forward to the return of the Jews flying sources in the skies all the things that we see today we are the endtime we are here now they know here we go they know the church was to receive a power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as a shadow becomes deeper and deeper you take a shade further away from the shade the least reflection you get of the shade and the shield got closer to the tree the shade of the same thing now the spirit that worked under justification and looter sonification under Wesley baptismal holy was from the Pentecost and here it isn't a last day performing and doing the very same thing that he did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one so he's identifying his ministry as a sign of the church and Christ becoming one isn't that right now here we go and watch they will connect together and she will go to the sky shouting up will come Wesley looter all the rest of them back there and he does his first will be last and last will be first in the Comoros direction we are the end time what was the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost does excuse me the Holy Ghost by justification see a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by signification a deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost here we go by the restoration of it's very peaceful being here performing signs and wonders like he did at the beginning they say who glory corner call me Holy Roller you might as well get started right now so justification shadow signification shadow baptism shadow but the restoration of the person that's the real thing oh let me say this with justification may not wait for certification certification make way for the battle Holy Ghost and the Parthenon the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself that is your promise Oh hallelujah glory the poor demon from paradox what is it Christ coming to his body here we go I'm not talking about fours anointed I'm not talking about 2nd Timothy I'm not talking about false prophets I'm not talking about bad behaviors I'm not talking about that I'm talking about sons and daughters of God oh are you were to give the lots of breezes people I don't weigh I just say a man I want you to worship what is it Christ coming to his body I like that who just bought his wife his brain Christ coming to his body do you know who you are you are his

themselves teachers having itching ears they want to hear every new ting every new revelations every new stuff but that's not what it's all about that's why I said knowledge shall increase not just natural science but even spiritual knowledge but it's not just half knowledge in the form of knowledge no knowledge has to come by revelation that knowledge dear in the world is not intellectual knowledge that is not chemistry and biology and physics and logic and what not that's God's knowledge that's the knowledge to know that God can't lie that God will keep his word that's the knowledge

Lord that's why you should be shouting tonight hallelujah praise God you're inside inside watch is a remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine Spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives so like a seed you have three parts you have a soul you have a spirit and you have a body you could be baptized in your spirit still not make it but that soul that seed that germ that comes from God you didn't stop that God started that god place you in the Lamb's Book of Life you are a gene port in this mind before it became word that was your gene thought that was your soul black ink or it's not right and that's soul that's seeded it's what God put inside of you and put you in debt and plant you in the earth and let the devil take you are just one of them normal seeds but you are a mystery hallelu and a mystery is in your history where you come from where I was though when I lay the foundation of the earth and the mornings I sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy you was not you didn't come in the beginning you were there before the beginning that's where you come from that's where your anointed comes from that's where your theophany is that before there was a moon before there was a star before there was the word you were the part that was in God and the world is not expressed so when color they express you he expressed the word and the word is God so that's why when you yet aware there's an instant connection you can't help it if it's something else built inside of you you can't even control it it is just something that's inside of you you are thought that coral expressed by this bird or chlorine of thought and you can only be a word there was a thought to begin with or how you have to be a taught to become weird to become wet

see the very elect it for possible Christ himself said that there be either two people so you're not ordinary you know there's a bunch of test people on the earth he said this I never shall deceive

victories victory upon victory that's the problem people are not getting victory you need victory you got to begin to get victory over the world over yourself over your thought you've got to begin you got to want it your passion for victory must be stronger than your fear of defeat here's a lot of shoulder praise no it's later than we ever were before but I'm still here and you are still here so relax and get down in the word now your passion for victory must be greater than your fear defeat [Applause] I'm not hearing the email I wanna hear I'm hearing surface am I want to hear even from your soul your passion of victory must be greater than your fear of defeat [Applause] that's why Gideon under that mental thing sure nama complex really good this busted-up another mental thing of being the least and so on I go out of the tell Gideon see there's sort of a lot and of Gideon now given Denova sword he had lump the brick he had no physical sword he just had to see it got them to see something he didn't even have in his hand literally see the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and then break the lamp break the picture on the lamp and zone Giza has to get courage to see the shorter the Lord and if it already confidence sort of the Lord that good sort of the Lord so good sword you have a problem with that there's a fight but and of Gideon yeah yeah but they put your name in it and of Gideon and all he did he break it and those guys panic I began if I didn't necessarily battle over obedience just do what God say and you would see the results in your life and your home and your family it may look simple Jesus stole the lepers go and show yourself to the priest very simple instead one bead on any River he didn't say go and take some green but or he blew bad he said go and show yourself to the priest he knew along the way they will be made whole and that's all just will be what God see take up a bed and walk just kick up your bed and walk Lucy I am greased up off

stop wandering people just to pray for you pray for you you ain't praying for your own self you're miserable in your own self stop tell yourself I can do all things tell yourself I'm a son of the king tell us of your access rights to your father tell yourself it kingdom can't kick you out come on cinnamon somebody come on get the law some princess people I think I'm gonna close you my goodness speech eat out of the team almost there but boy you wouldn't like to hit him you next Pilate is taking Oh hallelujah praise God but as Moses was calling the nation out of a nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see watch know nothing against them he says to refuse the person that's doing the callin no matter if you're a Pentecostal Baptist nothing against them not at all but this is the age you've gotta accept the personal Christ which is the word Oh Lord my goodness cut it cut about five more minutes again Christ my shaco revealed where I'm said the new blood and what is it now look look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation Christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ here we go now Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing now I know you can get that all the mysteries all the teachings all the things that that sum up into Christ in you what's the new burden but a Branham what is the nubile it is a revelation of Christ personally to you not you joint Church not you shook your hand anything like that what is it here we go you say when I'm Lutheran I'm Baptist I'm presbyterian that don't mean a thing to God during the message that doesn't mean a thing to God listen to what is you know what is it are you ready it is Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself now people only equate revelation with information knowledge and toxification an another word talking yappin the Kotok it the talking revelation but when Christ is revealed it is expressed so that's the purpose of Jesus Christ to express himself so all these services teachings world is to eventually become flesh in you that Christ comes out of you that people to take note that you have been with Jesus because Peter could even write his name the Paris that they were ignorant and unlearned but they had to take note that had been with Jesus because Christ was middle eyes made manifest in them as wasn't Moses [Applause] these guys are no cxe no GC your passes no University grief no mass there's nothing like that but that Kaizen em listen you know we crisis the mystery of God living in them and that is what got to live in you say see when you have that there is no Baptist Methodist there is no argument the manifestation is the interpretation or glory to God here we go I'm almost done watch so Christ expressing myself in the individual room where I is in the lecture when I he don't know his ABC half the Apostle didn't know it but I know Christ so the new birth is a revelation God has revealed to you this Christmas mystery it's a personal individual affair but the person that Christ is revealed to them so this more a group inspiration this link groupthink group theology this is you and God not you and your family not you and your brethren not you and this group ends a small group and we gather together and we believe this it have no we believe it is Christ expressing himself through you we believe that get as far now if you say I know you say this before but it will come fresh tonight if you say he has been revealed to me and the life that Christ produced here in the Bible does not produce itself in you you cut the wrong revelation Oh hallelujah so the revelation brings the life the real revelation that's why the Bible but about these divinely revealed mistreats roots it's what will literally turn the hands of the children back to the faith of the fathers so we understand how people have more intellectual faith than real revelation of the Holy Ghost comment down inside your fate they got that will give you an anchor when the storm come you Bianca Paul said in this way what can separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus shall prosecution shall pressure shall take nothing present nothing to come witness separate me from that goal from that love from that purpose [Music] [Applause] watch Wow and the life of Christ protect himself true you with the preeminence is to the people and they see the very life works science wonders what he did watch outside of that the rest of it is not even called to watch by lack of this revelation is why we are so much divisions and so much mockery so much divisions because the people lack the revelation they lacked version the teachers so because the teachers don't have the revelation did you know kind of crazy stuff what kind of foolish stuff and the people taking the stuff to say I am right you are wrong we are higher you are lower we are in front you are behind we have something you don't and in a bunch of immaturity that God can't come and confirm no fujas like that God was trip people trip Isaiah shut this one and shut that one Jesus went to tree to the other heart rise tree how he has an other trials to get an approved son why because character is not a gift we could never overemphasize that character is the victory you can't pay for character you can bribe but the rap tilaka past money for character you can see you have this annual character praise god most of the time people a lot of stuff have no character after they get blessed again Aragon to get proud everything else going to break people the Bible says Jesus learned obedience by the teen that he suffered God warns character but character is not a gift God gives you that you have to overcome something that's right the child after a while become the greatest thing in your life because every child needs an opportunity for victory every child needs an opportunity to be changed every child me like opportunity for your nature to be affected so you're not afraid of the storms you're gonna fail in the battle you stand like a man answer me where was dog I'm not lujah Oh glory to God amen somebody once said you must be born again he says a great chick because you're kind understand the kingdom the approach they put you have got to go to a process just like anything in our lives you've got to die to go to the born-again watch just two more things you cannot keep your same spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same ports you've got to die holiness done you cannot have your way younger when your mother host nothing the house of God go out have no spoiled children you will be a son will be a daughter but you have no inheritance you've got to die you have got to die die hallelujah praise God amen so when you were to choose to accept a Creed for my baptism offering you're supposed to lead here watch until the reckless self dead far from of the altar is not right I'm closing now what in very plain language now a hundred months 4:16 watch the Bible talk about Galatians tree identified the seed singular with Jesus and come to the sea children as Jonah promise and promise have to do with election the children of God that is exactly what we have been seen these who are the royal seeds are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God in the mind of God in his thoughts in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally do not
