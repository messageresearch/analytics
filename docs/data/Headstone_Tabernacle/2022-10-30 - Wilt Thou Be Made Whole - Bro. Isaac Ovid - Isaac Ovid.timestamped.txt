[54:21] musicians if you have your Bibles let's
[54:23] get straight to the word just one
[54:25] portion of scripture
[54:27] I like to read from Saint John 5.
[54:29] from verse 1
[54:33] . certainly appreciate
[54:35] a service on Wednesday night for the
[54:37] Solomon achina what a blessing what a an
[54:40] anointing word a presence what a word
[54:42] and you season and certainly the prayer
[54:45] meeting on Friday night
[54:48] man so reading Saint John 5 and reading
[54:51] from verse 1.
[54:54] after this there was a feast of the Jews
[54:57] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
[55:01] now there is that Jerusalem by the Sheep
[55:04] Market a pool
[55:05] which is called in the Hebrew tongue
[55:07] Bethesda having five porches
[55:10] and in these lay a great multitude of
[55:13] impotent Folk
[55:14] of blind halt withered waiting for the
[55:18] moving of the water
[55:19] for an angel went down at a sitting
[55:22] season into the pool and troubled the
[55:24] water
[55:25] whosoever then fist after the troubling
[55:28] of the water stepped in was made whole
[55:31] of whatsoever disease he had
[55:34] and a certain man was there which had an
[55:36] infirmity 30 and eight years
[55:39] and when Jesus saw him lie and knew that
[55:42] he had been now a long time in that case
[55:45] he say it unto him will thou be made
[55:49] whole
[55:51] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[55:53] reading of his word you may be seated
[55:55] this morning
[55:56] I like to take for a text
[55:59] will thou
[56:01] be made
[56:03] whole amen
[56:06] I remember preaching on this message
[56:08] maybe 20 years ago
[56:11] at that time we were having service
[56:14] downstairs
[56:16] because we were doing some work upstairs
[56:19] and it's been some time
[56:21] so I can't remember how the message was
[56:24] delivered 20 years ago
[56:26] but I do remember preaching on this
[56:28] subject will
[56:30] thou be made
[56:32] whole
[56:34] not all services are the same
[56:38] I'm not just speaking about difference
[56:39] in who is speaking
[56:42] and the day of the service
[56:45] but there are some services that focus
[56:47] on ministering to the needs of the
[56:50] people
[56:53] we are a needy people and
[56:56] different people have different needs
[56:58] and through the grace of God and the
[57:00] administration of the spirit there are
[57:02] some services that focus on the needs
[57:06] what is your need
[57:08] may he speak to your need
[57:11] this morning
[57:13] there are some services that focus on
[57:15] healing and deliverance and
[57:17] breakthroughs so this is
[57:19] tie to prayer lines and
[57:22] the prophet in his ministry and in his
[57:24] time and different phases of his
[57:26] ministry will have healing campaigns the
[57:28] whole objective of that service was to
[57:30] bring healing to the people bring
[57:32] breakthrough to the people cast out
[57:34] demons upon the people some services for
[57:37] ministering some services for healing
[57:40] and breakthrough and
[57:42] and then there are some services that
[57:44] focus on Doctrine teaching and bringing
[57:47] Clarity to the foundations and purpose
[57:50] of our faith
[57:52] our text this morning in Saint John 5
[57:56] finds Jesus having an encounter on a
[57:58] certain day in a certain place in a
[58:01] certain way and effectively in this
[58:04] encounter he does all three he ministers
[58:08] he heals and he brings Doctrine all in
[58:12] one encounter all for the kind of
[58:15] service that God would Minister he will
[58:18] bring healing and he would bring
[58:20] Doctrine to us that not only can the
[58:24] needs of our hearts and our souls and
[58:26] our minds be dealt with but the
[58:28] spiritual activation and the moving and
[58:30] the rustling the mulberry tree that's
[58:32] required to shake us from lethargy into
[58:35] action could also move us from a state
[58:37] of being blind to being able to see from
[58:39] being lame to being able to walk from
[58:41] being dead to being raised up because
[58:43] there's a spiritual moving of the spirit
[58:46] that's beyond the world just going forth
[58:48] and yet still on top of that to give us
[58:50] doctrine that we can live a word in due
[58:53] season now we can know how to move how
[58:55] to act how to operate how to deal with
[58:57] those around us how to live as a
[58:59] Christian especially in such a time as
[59:02] this
[59:03] and the church say Amen
[59:06] this text we read in Saint John 5 I'm
[59:09] just laying a little background before
[59:10] we get into the preaching
[59:13] John is unique in how he delivers
[59:17] as part of one of the four Gospels
[59:20] I've said it before that when you look
[59:22] through the gospels Matthew Mark Luke
[59:24] and John they represent four
[59:27] perspectives of the same series of
[59:29] events
[59:30] Matthew looks at it one way
[59:32] Mark looks at it another way Luke looks
[59:35] at it another way and John looks at it
[59:37] when you look at Matthew he looks at the
[59:40] chronological movement and he goes back
[59:42] and lays out the genealogy and each one
[59:44] touches it his own way John is unique
[59:46] and the reason I'm raising it is because
[59:48] this passage of scripture is not found
[59:51] in any other book but the Book of John
[59:53] there are many experiences you can find
[59:56] in the different books but this one is
[59:57] unique and John is a unique deliverer of
[1:00:01] his of the word of God because he starts
[1:00:03] off with in the beginning was the word
[1:00:05] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:00:07] was God the same was in the beginning
[1:00:09] was God and all things were made by him
[1:00:12] and without him was not anything made
[1:00:13] that was made then him was life and the
[1:00:16] life was the light of men and the light
[1:00:18] shined in darkness and the Darkness
[1:00:21] comprehended it not and he went strong
[1:00:24] on Doctrine he came unto his own and his
[1:00:26] own receipt I'm not that's the way John
[1:00:28] wrote that's the way John ministered but
[1:00:31] as many as received him to them give me
[1:00:34] power to become the sons of God he was
[1:00:37] introducing sonship in the very first
[1:00:40] chapter of John he was introducing this
[1:00:43] concept of sonship
[1:00:45] but as many as received him that them
[1:00:49] gave past tense he power to become the
[1:00:51] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:00:54] his name which were born not a blood nor
[1:00:57] of the will of the flesh so your birth
[1:01:00] was not your parents doing Family
[1:01:02] Planning
[1:01:04] Hallelujah it was not of the will of the
[1:01:06] flesh nor of the will of manner but of
[1:01:09] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:01:12] dwelt Among Us that's how John
[1:01:13] ministered
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] anybody with me this morning
[1:01:21] what is Captain here in John 5 is
[1:01:24] significant that is also paradoxical and
[1:01:26] I don't know what drove you to church
[1:01:28] this morning in the sea of the
[1:01:31] negativity of the weather and the storms
[1:01:33] maybe you have a great need maybe you're
[1:01:35] here because you're just supposed to be
[1:01:37] in church maybe you're here this morning
[1:01:39] because your heart is longing for a
[1:01:41] greater experience of a deeper Walker I
[1:01:45] pray to God that there's a deep desire
[1:01:47] for you being here yes you may have been
[1:01:50] invited but I pray that there's
[1:01:51] something more than just an invitation
[1:01:54] that's strumming the strings of your
[1:01:56] heart that you could say oh I was glad
[1:01:58] when they said unto me let us go into
[1:02:00] the house of the Lord the Bible says no
[1:02:02] man could come unless the father draws
[1:02:05] so even though you are here this morning
[1:02:07] it's God drawing you into his presence
[1:02:10] God drawing you into his word god
[1:02:13] drawing you into an experience with the
[1:02:16] supernatural that you could never be a
[1:02:18] Sim again every encounter with God is
[1:02:22] never to leave you the same way he met
[1:02:24] you it's always to bring change and your
[1:02:28] present here this morning is going to
[1:02:30] change you I guarantee it's going to
[1:02:33] change you it could be for the worse or
[1:02:35] it could be for the better some people
[1:02:37] they leave to church worse than they
[1:02:39] came in but I pray to God you live
[1:02:41] better you can never come to the house
[1:02:43] of God and leave the same way that you
[1:02:46] came something has got to happen
[1:02:47] somebody preached me this morning
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:55] can I just talk to you a little bit can
[1:02:57] we encourage one another a little bit
[1:02:59] last week Sunday we spoke about anchor
[1:03:01] points of Faith where we are reminded of
[1:03:04] certain things that took place so that
[1:03:06] when the devil shakes us we can rock
[1:03:08] back on the young car and know that the
[1:03:10] anchor holds in spite of the storm that
[1:03:12] no matter what the devil throws away no
[1:03:15] matter what I built through our way no
[1:03:17] matter what the doctors report your wife
[1:03:19] your children your neighbor the economy
[1:03:21] the government it doesn't matter there's
[1:03:23] an anchor in the scripture that he could
[1:03:26] hold on to and you could say the Lord
[1:03:27] did it for him he could do it with me if
[1:03:30] he did it for her he could do it for me
[1:03:33] I know he's done it for me before he did
[1:03:36] something for me last week he did
[1:03:38] something for me last month he did
[1:03:40] something with me 10 years ago he did
[1:03:42] something with me 15 years ago I saw
[1:03:44] what he did from Mama I saw what you did
[1:03:47] for Papa I saw how he changed brother so
[1:03:49] and so I saw returned from sister so and
[1:03:52] so when is it gonna be my time when is
[1:03:55] it gonna be my season I know he's a
[1:03:57] prayer answering God I know if a miracle
[1:04:00] working God that's not the issue this
[1:04:02] morning the issue is what about me what
[1:04:05] about my situation what about my need
[1:04:08] what about my conditioner what about my
[1:04:12] back against the wall nobody knows what
[1:04:15] I'm going through I'm here this morning
[1:04:17] on a wing and a prayer I'm here this
[1:04:19] morning barely screaming because the
[1:04:22] devil knocked me up against a wall but
[1:04:24] I'm here this morning to worship and to
[1:04:26] cry and to seek and to say Lord don't
[1:04:28] forget me don't forget your son don't
[1:04:31] forget your daughter don't forget me
[1:04:33] this morning
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:37] you may be seated
[1:04:39] Hallelujah
[1:04:40] a simple message but I prayed both
[1:04:44] this morning so it's in John 5 you read
[1:04:47] the scripture after this there was a
[1:04:50] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[1:04:53] Jerusalem in the Amplified it simply
[1:04:56] says later on so we are going Beyond
[1:04:59] Saint John 1 2 3 4 to just some point in
[1:05:02] time that's a bit later on there was a
[1:05:04] feast and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
[1:05:08] can the church say Amen the scripture
[1:05:11] doesn't tell us exactly which Feast it
[1:05:12] was
[1:05:15] every Jewish treat was important
[1:05:18] every Jewish feast was an anchor point
[1:05:20] every Jewish priests had a purpose and
[1:05:23] it was a reminder of how God had dealt
[1:05:25] with them
[1:05:27] where it was the Feast of the Passover
[1:05:29] when they will remember how God
[1:05:32] hallelujah tougher them in Egypt where
[1:05:35] it was the Feast of the unleavened bread
[1:05:37] or the Peace of the first fruit
[1:05:40] it didn't matter what the feast was
[1:05:42] Jesus wanted to be there every true Jew
[1:05:45] wanted to be present in Jerusalem once
[1:05:49] there was a celebration of a peace you
[1:05:51] couldn't tell me you were a real Jew if
[1:05:54] you were not going to celebrate the
[1:05:55] Anchor Point of the feast
[1:06:00] anybody with me this morning
[1:06:03] Hallelujah if you were not there there
[1:06:05] was a question about your revelation of
[1:06:07] the significance of how God took you out
[1:06:10] of Egypt Hallelujah at every Feast it
[1:06:13] was the same Feast they celebrated every
[1:06:15] year it wasn't a new message it wasn't a
[1:06:18] new doctrine it was the remember when
[1:06:20] when there was this plague and when all
[1:06:23] the firstborns were supposed to die and
[1:06:25] we took the blood and we put it on the
[1:06:28] doorpost and every single year they
[1:06:30] would have the same message the same
[1:06:33] reminder and every single year if you
[1:06:35] are real Jew you were identified with
[1:06:38] the feasts you couldn't absent yourself
[1:06:40] from the feedstock you couldn't upset
[1:06:42] yourself from the fellowship you can
[1:06:44] absent yourself from the service
[1:06:46] [Applause]
[1:06:49] what it was the Feast of Pentecost the
[1:06:52] Feast of trumpets the day of the
[1:06:54] atonement or the Feast of the Tabernacle
[1:06:56] any true Jew wanting to be there for the
[1:06:59] feast when it was Wednesday service when
[1:07:01] it was prayer meeting where there is
[1:07:03] Sunday service it didn't matter you were
[1:07:06] identified with every Anchor Point which
[1:07:09] was a reminder of how God took you
[1:07:11] through what God wanted you to know what
[1:07:14] he was building upon anybody in the
[1:07:16] house this morning
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:21] even outside of the seven Great feasts
[1:07:24] they had the Festival of the Feast of
[1:07:26] Purim you know what that one was that
[1:07:29] was a reminder of when Esther went to
[1:07:32] the king and save our parents are perish
[1:07:34] but are going to see the king oh
[1:07:36] Hallelujah and mercy was brought to the
[1:07:39] Jews God established a feast to remember
[1:07:42] that they could have all been dead wiped
[1:07:45] out as a people but through the grace of
[1:07:47] God and to the testimony of faster
[1:07:50] how could you forget that if it wasn't
[1:07:52] for them you couldn't be in church this
[1:07:54] morning
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:08:01] building into something because I want
[1:08:03] you to understand how this is unfolding
[1:08:06] so Jesus the word made flesh
[1:08:09] there was nothing about the world you
[1:08:11] could tell Jesus because he was the word
[1:08:13] [Applause]
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:17] he didn't say I'm not going to it
[1:08:19] because I know it already
[1:08:22] the world made flesh
[1:08:25] left Galilee
[1:08:27] to head to Jerusalem for one primary
[1:08:30] reason to celebrate the feasts this
[1:08:34] should come as no surprise to us because
[1:08:36] when he was 12 years old Luke captures
[1:08:38] in Luke 2 42 they went up to Jerusalem I
[1:08:42] after the customer defeated
[1:08:44] Feast it was because of the feast I'm
[1:08:46] going to the speak to the faces how he
[1:08:48] end up in the temple talking about I
[1:08:51] must be about my father's business
[1:08:54] he ended up in the temple because he was
[1:08:56] going to the feast did you come to Feast
[1:08:58] this morning what did you come to
[1:09:01] is it Church you came to or you came to
[1:09:03] the feast
[1:09:05] oh the spiritual peace that God has laid
[1:09:08] out for us this morning
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:12] a little surprise I wanted to catch
[1:09:14] something because they will get so
[1:09:16] mature in their Christian walk that they
[1:09:18] don't think they need the Lord and they
[1:09:19] don't need Church any morning they sit
[1:09:21] on them I want to play tips and relax
[1:09:23] for Jesus left Galilee
[1:09:27] it takes 30 hours on average for the
[1:09:30] Raymond to leave Galilee and come to
[1:09:33] Jerusalem let me remind you there were
[1:09:36] no taxis there were no buses there were
[1:09:38] no trains there was no public
[1:09:40] transportation system so Jesus had to
[1:09:43] make a choice
[1:09:45] to leave Galilee
[1:09:48] to come to Jerusalem
[1:09:50] for the purpose of the feast
[1:09:52] it should come as no surprise to us
[1:09:54] because in Luke 4.
[1:09:56] the Bible says he came to Nazareth where
[1:09:59] he had been brought up and as his custom
[1:10:01] words he went into the synagogue so
[1:10:03] Jesus was always in church
[1:10:05] listen to the name talk about him
[1:10:07] knowing but wait man that's it you have
[1:10:10] that mixed up there you know but he
[1:10:11] didn't he didn't correct him
[1:10:13] could you imagine
[1:10:15] Jesus sitting in the temple and they're
[1:10:17] talking about him and he's just smiling
[1:10:19] Discerning their hearts knowing what's
[1:10:21] going on there but he doesn't absent
[1:10:24] himself because it is part of what
[1:10:26] you're supposed to do as a Christian to
[1:10:28] be in Fellowship Hebrews 10 25 not
[1:10:31] forsaken the assembling of ourselves
[1:10:33] together if Jesus could make it his
[1:10:35] business
[1:10:37] to go to church what about you
[1:10:43] let this be a reminder to us because
[1:10:46] Jesus get a cycle going to heal somebody
[1:10:47] else
[1:10:50] but he placed himself under the law
[1:10:53] under the requirement to give us an
[1:10:55] example come the church say amen
[1:10:58] he was the word and the word still went
[1:11:00] to the temple
[1:11:02] every scripture reference in a temple
[1:11:04] would point to him and he still went to
[1:11:06] the temple there was nothing they could
[1:11:08] teach him but he still went to the
[1:11:10] temple
[1:11:12] anybody with me this morning you know
[1:11:14] it's a little bottle suddenly a little
[1:11:16] encouragement to you to find yourself in
[1:11:18] church
[1:11:19] find yourself in the presence find
[1:11:21] yourself in Fellowship find yourself
[1:11:23] among Believers find yourself where you
[1:11:26] can lift your Praises again as you were
[1:11:28] in the upper room in one mind and one
[1:11:30] Accord under expectation for the promise
[1:11:33] Hallelujah until churches get shut down
[1:11:36] find yourself in the house of God
[1:11:39] Hallelujah if Jesus had to plan in
[1:11:42] advance it'll take three fives I don't
[1:11:45] know how long it took to get there but
[1:11:47] Anthony but it was not getting up this
[1:11:49] morning I'm feeling to go to church he
[1:11:50] had to leave in sufficient time to get
[1:11:53] there on time because there was 30 hours
[1:11:55] of walking to do to get to the house
[1:12:01] so I want us to picture this morning
[1:12:03] Jesus leaving Galilee and he's walking
[1:12:06] walking walking to Jerusalem
[1:12:09] thinking about the
[1:12:11] I don't know which Feast what he was
[1:12:12] thinking about the feast because when
[1:12:14] you're on your way to do something it it
[1:12:16] consumes you it's your purpose it's your
[1:12:18] destination you're heading somewhere
[1:12:23] verse two now there is a Jerusalem
[1:12:26] by the Sheep Market the pool
[1:12:29] we're just calling the Hebrew tongue
[1:12:31] Bethesda having five poachers
[1:12:35] in the Amplified it says now in
[1:12:37] Jerusalem made a sheep gate
[1:12:41] so in the King James it says the Sheep
[1:12:43] Market in the Amplified it says the
[1:12:46] Sheep gate
[1:12:48] John is painting a very clear picture of
[1:12:51] what is unfolding
[1:12:53] friends there's more than one way to get
[1:12:56] into Jerusalem
[1:12:57] there's more than one gate to enter
[1:12:59] Jerusalem
[1:13:01] there's more than one kid that surrounds
[1:13:03] Jerusalem in fact around the time of
[1:13:05] Jesus there should have been at least
[1:13:07] seven entrance points
[1:13:09] if you go back to the days of Nehemiah
[1:13:11] there were about 10 Gates that you could
[1:13:13] enter the truth it was a choice which
[1:13:15] geared to choose to enter into the walls
[1:13:18] of Jerusalem
[1:13:21] Jesus chose to pass through the Sheep
[1:13:24] gate
[1:13:26] pass through the Sheep Market
[1:13:28] the Sheep Market was the main place
[1:13:30] where the animals for all the Sheep was
[1:13:33] gathered where the wait where you could
[1:13:35] go and buy a sheep to do the sacrifice
[1:13:37] the Sheep gate was where the Lambs would
[1:13:40] be led through the Sheep gave on their
[1:13:42] way to be sacrificed and Jesus choose to
[1:13:45] enter into Jerusalem via the Sheep gate
[1:13:49] I want you to think about that and what
[1:13:52] I felt it noteworthy that John would
[1:13:53] capture the subtle but significant fact
[1:13:56] that the Lamb of God
[1:13:58] that would take away the sin of the
[1:14:00] world would choose to pass through the
[1:14:02] same gate
[1:14:03] how many lambs would have been ushered
[1:14:05] through on their way to be sacrificed
[1:14:07] but he willingly subjected himself to
[1:14:10] just let me enter by the Sheep gate past
[1:14:14] the Sheep Market where they would be
[1:14:16] checking out looking for lambs without
[1:14:17] blemish looking for lambs without
[1:14:19] spotting looking for alarm saved could
[1:14:22] this one be the one that I can often
[1:14:24] sacrifice and Jesus says finally coming
[1:14:27] in close to Jerusalem walking between
[1:14:29] all these lambs and these conversations
[1:14:31] and he finds himself walking towards the
[1:14:39] looking back to Nehemiah and we studied
[1:14:41] it when we studied Nehemiah that in
[1:14:43] rebelling the walls of Jerusalem
[1:14:46] the very first place they restored was
[1:14:48] the Sheep gate
[1:14:51] in Nehemiah chapter 3 verse 1 then Elias
[1:14:54] shipped the high priest rolls up with
[1:14:56] his breath when the priests and they
[1:14:58] build it the Sheep gate they Sanctified
[1:15:00] it and settled the doors of it even into
[1:15:03] the Tower of mere they Sanctified it
[1:15:06] until the Tower of Hannon Hill
[1:15:09] and next to him build it a man of
[1:15:11] Jericho I'm next to them building soccer
[1:15:14] so they were building and restoring the
[1:15:16] walls around Jerusalem and they started
[1:15:18] at the Sheep gate
[1:15:20] because they understood the role of
[1:15:22] sacrifice they understood that the body
[1:15:25] altered and about a way for the ship to
[1:15:27] pass the end of that chapter ends with
[1:15:30] and between the going up of the corner
[1:15:33] until the ship gate repaired the
[1:15:35] goldsmiths and the merchants in other
[1:15:37] words by the currents they started at
[1:15:39] the ship gate restored the entire wall
[1:15:42] of Jerusalem and finish up by the Sheep
[1:15:51] just throwing some stuff to you in the
[1:15:53] scriptures in history if you were to
[1:15:56] walk into Jerusalem now
[1:15:58] but appeal to wear that place that was
[1:16:01] called as she did
[1:16:03] is identified and you ask anybody around
[1:16:06] there what is the name of this gate
[1:16:09] they will tell you
[1:16:10] it's called the Lion's gate
[1:16:14] you go figure that out we'll study that
[1:16:16] out
[1:16:17] the gate that was once called a sheep
[1:16:19] gate is now called the Lions
[1:16:25] Beyond
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:29] back then it was called a chicken but
[1:16:31] today in our day that same place of
[1:16:34] Entry is called Lions game what do you
[1:16:36] research but there it was back then as
[1:16:39] John baptism Jesus is walking there
[1:16:43] and what is notable about there is that
[1:16:45] right where the Lambs are gathered and
[1:16:47] right alarms are passion there's a pool
[1:16:49] a pool
[1:16:52] and that word Bethesda means House of
[1:16:54] Mercy
[1:16:56] House of kindness having five porches
[1:17:00] five coverings to protect the people
[1:17:02] from the elements as it were the same
[1:17:04] you have Bethlehem House of God's bread
[1:17:07] or House of Bread path means house lehem
[1:17:09] means bread and Jewish
[1:17:12] Beth Esther that Esther means kindness
[1:17:15] or Mercy the house of kindness so Jesus
[1:17:18] chooses to not just pass through the
[1:17:20] Sheep market and pass by the ship gave
[1:17:22] body he's walking on the way to the
[1:17:25] feast
[1:17:27] yeah
[1:17:29] and the lamb walks through a sheep gate
[1:17:32] and mercy passes by the House of Mercy
[1:17:35] kindness passed by the house of kindness
[1:17:38] Hallelujah and there will gather the
[1:17:41] Bible said a multitude of people
[1:17:44] House of Grace a multitude of people who
[1:17:47] were there almost Hospital have you ever
[1:17:50] walked into a hospital
[1:17:51] and see people
[1:17:54] sick
[1:17:55] needy looking for help the Bible says
[1:17:58] indeedly a great multitude of impotent
[1:18:00] folk of blind
[1:18:02] heart with a waiting for the moving of
[1:18:06] the water oh what a sight to see Church
[1:18:09] of people who are gathered from all over
[1:18:12] looking for a chance to get help because
[1:18:15] they couldn't help themselves many were
[1:18:17] blind many were lame many were crippled
[1:18:20] many needs maybe they had spent all
[1:18:23] their money and they had no more money
[1:18:24] so they had to rely on coming right
[1:18:26] there by this pool of Bethesda because
[1:18:28] the Bible says at a certain season an
[1:18:31] angel will come and stir the waters they
[1:18:35] didn't know what day he would come they
[1:18:37] didn't know what time he would come but
[1:18:39] they knew that at a certain season an
[1:18:41] angel will come and stir the waters and
[1:18:44] whoever was first to get in whoever was
[1:18:46] the first person to get in was gonna get
[1:18:49] healed of whatsoever disease he had
[1:19:10] whosoever was first
[1:19:13] oh hallelujah hallelujah a stirring what
[1:19:17] we need is another stirring a storing of
[1:19:20] the waters a troubling of the waters
[1:19:22] some of us the waters are too still some
[1:19:25] of us there's nothing going on but may
[1:19:27] the angel come and stir the water in
[1:19:29] your home map may he disrupt what's
[1:19:31] going on in your home but some of us our
[1:19:34] lives are too calm May the angel come
[1:19:37] and Trouble the waters may he shovel the
[1:19:39] waters this morning oh hallelujah
[1:19:42] hallelujah
[1:19:44] in the message of third seal that's the
[1:19:47] reason the daily revivals we're supposed
[1:19:49] to have we have denominational revivals
[1:19:51] we have another real stirring no no no
[1:19:53] no no no no sir don't think we've got
[1:19:55] revivals we haven't or they've got
[1:19:57] millions millions of church members but
[1:19:59] that the Revival nowhere the pride
[1:20:01] hasn't had a Revival yet there's been a
[1:20:04] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:20:07] stir the pride we are looking for it
[1:20:09] it'll take those seven and none unknown
[1:20:12] pandas back here to wake her up again he
[1:20:15] will send it he promised it oh
[1:20:19] Hallelujah May the angel of the Lord May
[1:20:22] the angel of the Covenant stir the
[1:20:25] waters this morning oh it'll take those
[1:20:27] seven tunnels to stir these Waters it'll
[1:20:31] take a great power to stir these water
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:49] the angel would stir the waters come on
[1:20:52] church I want you to pay attention and
[1:20:54] here's why I need to pay attention
[1:20:57] and whosoever then first
[1:21:01] after the troubling of the water
[1:21:04] step in
[1:21:05] was being whole of whatsoever disease so
[1:21:08] it's two things that are happening here
[1:21:10] you have to be first
[1:21:11] and it didn't matter what the problem
[1:21:13] was it didn't matter what the disease
[1:21:15] was it didn't matter what the situation
[1:21:16] was you had a blank check if it was
[1:21:20] mental if it was physical if it was
[1:21:22] emotional whatever the disease was it
[1:21:25] didn't matter there was no limit in what
[1:21:27] disease was being addressed so that is
[1:21:29] not the issue issue is not the disease
[1:21:32] because that's been sorted out
[1:21:34] whatsoever disease you had the issues
[1:21:36] first

[1:28:18] morning that feels his holy spirit in
[1:28:20] our presence now could realize that's
[1:28:22] the evidence of a prayer that you prayed
[1:28:24] has been answered in the presence of God
[1:28:26] every man who wants a baptism of the
[1:28:28] Holy Ghost if you feel a little Grand
[1:28:30] feeling saying I believe that's a truth
[1:28:32] that's the evidence raise up your hand
[1:28:34] and say God I receive it now something
[1:28:36] would tip
[1:28:41] I don't know
[1:28:44] so I want you to see the picture Jesus
[1:28:47] left Galilee
[1:28:49] walked for this walked by the Sheep
[1:28:52] Market is making his way
[1:28:55] in front of the people heading to the
[1:28:58] feast
[1:29:00] he didn't come to be recognized he
[1:29:02] didn't come to deal with situations he
[1:29:05] didn't come to minister to anybody I
[1:29:06] want to be clear on this and we'll see
[1:29:08] it as we read further in the scripture
[1:29:09] he was not ready for his ministry to be
[1:29:12] made public
[1:29:15] there were many times we started where
[1:29:16] he said tell no man
[1:29:18] what I did
[1:29:19] keep it a secret because the time is not
[1:29:22] hit so Jesus coming in quietly
[1:29:25] unannounced
[1:29:28] amen and verse 5 and a sin man was there
[1:29:31] which had an infirmity 30.
[1:29:34] and eight years
[1:29:39] what a time to have a situation in your
[1:29:41] life
[1:29:45] 38 years
[1:29:48] something wrong
[1:29:50] 38 years sick
[1:29:52] 38 years you're struggling
[1:29:55] 38 years you're coming to church
[1:30:01] looking for something
[1:30:09] and the Bible says in verse 6 when Jesus
[1:30:12] saw him lie
[1:30:14] a new
[1:30:16] that he had been now a long time in that
[1:30:18] case
[1:30:20] you see it unto him
[1:30:23] without
[1:30:25] be mean who
[1:30:26] in the Amplified it says when Jesus
[1:30:29] noticed him
[1:30:32] so I want you to see about the Karen
[1:30:33] Jesus is walking
[1:30:37] but many times speak about people ask
[1:30:39] why would Jesus not heal let me say
[1:30:40] because Jesus will only do what if I
[1:30:42] ever show him
[1:30:43] compassion is not feeling sorry for
[1:30:45] people got passions in the will of God
[1:30:46] so Jesus is walking and he's walking and
[1:30:49] I wonder if Jesus were to walk to the
[1:30:51] church this morning and just walk him
[1:30:54] and I don't know if at what point but
[1:30:56] Anthony he stopped walking
[1:30:59] because something caught his attention
[1:31:02] there were so many people but a joy was
[1:31:04] a multitude but one person caught his
[1:31:07] attention and he noticed him
[1:31:11] 38 years
[1:31:18] and he asked him a strange question
[1:31:23] a strange question to ask someone who
[1:31:26] had been sick for so long
[1:31:30] because who wouldn't want to be May rule
[1:31:36] but yet Jesus asked the question
[1:31:41] didn't this man choose to be in a place
[1:31:44] where people were looking for healing
[1:31:45] how could Jesus asked him well now we
[1:31:48] need who wasn't his condition obvious
[1:31:53] what was Jesus trying to get at
[1:31:57] shouldn't they have been a look in his
[1:31:59] face in his eyes that should have made
[1:32:02] that question unnecessary
[1:32:05] yeah man um
[1:32:07] could it be that Jesus or hope and
[1:32:10] hopelessness
[1:32:13] mixed together
[1:32:15] what a combination
[1:32:19] and part of this for me friends is I've
[1:32:22] been in so many services where and no
[1:32:25] people need help
[1:32:28] ask yourself the question do they
[1:32:30] rehab
[1:32:35] it's not a simple question
[1:32:38] you see all the calls and people should
[1:32:40] be the first at the altar but they don't
[1:32:42] want to come
[1:32:44] do you really want help
[1:32:48] could it be that the man was there but
[1:32:50] he wasn't there
[1:32:53] he was there but he wasn't there
[1:32:58] could it be that the Lord perceived at
[1:33:00] his infirmity had become moral physical
[1:33:05] and had now become an infirmity of the
[1:33:07] mind and the Heart
[1:33:10] could it be here to reach a stage where
[1:33:13] if it happens it happens
[1:33:16] could it be here become indifferent
[1:33:19] hungry for so long you're no longer feel
[1:33:21] hungry
[1:33:26] it's as if Jesus wanted to be really
[1:33:28] sure I see you here in church this
[1:33:30] morning but do you really want to be
[1:33:32] delivered
[1:33:35] I see your body here you're at the pool
[1:33:37] but I'm not seeing any real desperation
[1:33:40] anymore
[1:33:42] do you really want help
[1:33:45] do you really want to change
[1:33:48] do you really want Deliverance
[1:33:51] do you really want to break through
[1:33:54] I know you're saying amen or no but do
[1:33:56] you really want it
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] do you really want transformation will
[1:34:01] thou be made whole
[1:34:05] you see come into the pool had changed
[1:34:08] for this man it was not always that way
[1:34:11] there was a time even though he had his
[1:34:14] infirmity his feet was higher
[1:34:19] his expectation was higher his Hope was
[1:34:23] higher his desire was higher
[1:34:26] but no coming to the pool had just
[1:34:29] become a routine
[1:34:31] he was there with no real intention
[1:34:35] of going into the pool
[1:34:38] hear me and hear me well Church of the
[1:34:40] Living God he was at the place where the
[1:34:43] angel would come but he really wasn't
[1:34:45] serious
[1:34:48] he had already made up his mind that it
[1:34:51] was not for him
[1:34:53] after a long time in the message
[1:34:57] he had just come to accept this as
[1:34:59] something that he's supposed to do to
[1:35:01] show up just in case something work out
[1:35:04] just in case I go
[1:35:06] but it's just in case
[1:35:10] and out of everybody who was there
[1:35:11] that's what Jesus noticed
[1:35:15] I can't help but Wonder
[1:35:18] if there's anybody here today
[1:35:20] in the same condition
[1:35:23] yeah yeah in church
[1:35:24] but you're really not here
[1:35:32] the question the Lord Jesus asked on
[1:35:34] that day is still unnecessary question
[1:35:37] amen Jesus was asking this man quietly
[1:35:41] because he wasn't trying to bring
[1:35:42] attention to himself
[1:35:44] you really want this
[1:35:47] you really want the Holy Ghost
[1:35:49] you really want to change your talk
[1:35:52] you really want that jealousy to come
[1:35:53] out your heart you really want the Envy
[1:35:56] to come out you really want that lost
[1:35:58] demon that pornographic Spirit you
[1:36:00] really want that adultery and that
[1:36:02] fornication and that desire that lion
[1:36:05] Tom you really want to be made whole I
[1:36:08] see you here
[1:36:10] among people who looking for change but
[1:36:12] you're anyone to give up you're lying
[1:36:13] and is stealing and he's drinking and
[1:36:15] you really are you sure you're
[1:36:19] you're location saying you won't change
[1:36:21] your condition say
[1:36:23] change but your mind at heart something
[1:36:26] is still off yeah but
[1:36:29] do you really want to be made whole
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:43] in a certain sense it was a religious
[1:36:45] spirit you know
[1:36:51] how many people are in churches this
[1:36:53] morning knowing they need help wanting
[1:36:56] them but in their mind and heart they
[1:36:58] already make up their mind that this is
[1:37:00] not for them
[1:37:01] it's a real and we'll see it it's a real
[1:37:03] scripture it's a real situation and
[1:37:05] that's why this is so important to us oh
[1:37:06] God help us
[1:37:08] that we could see beyond our situation
[1:37:11] to see oh God do you desire 100 years
[1:37:14] ago when I would hold us
[1:37:16] I'm not there and it's supposed to be
[1:37:18] even more than where he was before
[1:37:21] all these years you come to church your
[1:37:24] feet actually lower your hope is lower
[1:37:26] your Expedition is lower
[1:37:31] will thou be made whole
[1:37:33] deeper than physical healing
[1:37:35] will thou be made whole it's about
[1:37:37] Deliverance it's about restoration it's
[1:37:40] about Redemption it's about perfection
[1:37:42] it's about adoption
[1:37:46] and friends the Lord Jesus wasn't making
[1:37:49] any assumptions he was not saying
[1:37:52] because you're in church I'm gonna bless
[1:37:54] you
[1:37:57] make no mistake about it there are some
[1:37:59] people who don't want to change you know
[1:38:02] you tell them forgive forgive forgive
[1:38:04] forgive forgive forgive forgive forgive
[1:38:06] and they still can't forgive will know
[1:38:08] me at home
[1:38:09] are you ready to give up that Grudge
[1:38:12] are you ready to shake that brother's
[1:38:14] hand your Wonder Revival what you're
[1:38:17] ready because this whole mess we're
[1:38:18] talking about
[1:38:19] Hallelujah not just a miracle is who
[1:38:21] unless we're talking about will tell me
[1:38:24] are you ready to give up that Grudge
[1:38:26] that you're hell everyone for all these
[1:38:28] 38 years 25 years 20 years I pursuited
[1:38:31] you're wrong and you still can't see
[1:38:33] them right here you're in church every
[1:38:34] year every Sunday every service but do
[1:38:37] you really want
[1:38:39] you really want change
[1:38:43] they're people who don't want to be
[1:38:45] delivered they give you lip service
[1:38:49] it is a tragedy when there are people
[1:38:51] who can't shake one another's hands you
[1:38:53] want to be whole are you are you you
[1:38:55] really want to read them all
[1:38:59] you can't reconcile with your brother
[1:39:00] can reconcile with your sister
[1:39:04] they don't want to forsake the world and
[1:39:06] be completely sold out
[1:39:08] is this for anybody this morning
[1:39:13] this friends is not a simple question
[1:39:16] the question is not do you want to be
[1:39:17] safe I'm going to hell that's easier
[1:39:18] than saying I don't want to go to hell
[1:39:22] not do you want to be saved go to heaven
[1:39:25] that's an easy question yeah I want to
[1:39:26] go to heaven
[1:39:28] the question of will now be made whole
[1:39:30] speaks to a state of holiness
[1:39:33] a state of
[1:39:35] kindness
[1:39:39] by definition wholeness is a state of
[1:39:42] forming a complete and harmonious wall
[1:39:47] a state of being unbroken or undamaged
[1:39:51] because Jesus was looking at this man
[1:39:53] and seeing more issues than his
[1:39:55] infirmity
[1:39:57] that was now hindering
[1:40:00] his own healing and his own Deliverance
[1:40:02] anybody with me this morning could you
[1:40:04] take some more anybody in the house
[1:40:12] cool
[1:40:13] Unity
[1:40:15] completeness let's have a few quotes
[1:40:17] before we begin to wind down in Oneness
[1:40:20] but Abraham said that's God's purpose
[1:40:22] his purpose as father was to be one with
[1:40:25] his family whole complete Earthly family
[1:40:27] the only way that they could be one with
[1:40:29] a family where God was because God's
[1:40:30] nature was in them
[1:40:32] if that's the requirement and the
[1:40:34] definition of wholeness do you really
[1:40:36] want that holds
[1:40:38] it's not a beautiful picture God in his
[1:40:41] family father over all Supreme no death
[1:40:43] no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just
[1:40:46] joy unspeakable never to be sick never
[1:40:49] to have a heartache just one with God
[1:40:51] what a picture because the very nature
[1:40:53] of God was in these people and therefore
[1:40:56] what they did they followed just in line
[1:40:58] with God
[1:40:59] and God with them made them one
[1:41:07] I'm not talking about coming to church
[1:41:09] I'm not talking about being in a message
[1:41:11] I'm not talking about being in the House
[1:41:13] of Mercy or the House of Grace or being
[1:41:15] in your Tabernacle this morning the
[1:41:17] question is do you want to be made truly
[1:41:19] whole
[1:41:21] allow me to remind you that only two men
[1:41:24] were truly whole
[1:41:25] Adam before he lost it and the Lord
[1:41:28] Jesus Christ and we can look back to
[1:41:30] when Adam to before Adam fell when he
[1:41:33] was whole old to behold like Adam before
[1:41:36] the fall
[1:41:37] to have dominion perfect fellowship with
[1:41:40] God no desire to find satisfaction
[1:41:43] outside of God he was whole he was happy
[1:41:46] he didn't have to look for happiness
[1:41:48] he'd have to go and get a drink you
[1:41:49] don't have to find another woman you
[1:41:51] know he was whole he was complete
[1:41:53] nothing could move him he was satisfied
[1:41:56] to be in the presence of God he longed
[1:41:59] to have Holy Communion fellowship with
[1:42:02] God in the cool of the evening that was
[1:42:04] being whole he was at peace he did not
[1:42:07] know sadness he did not know trouble is
[1:42:10] that the kind of wholeness will thou be
[1:42:12] made whole if we Define wholeness like
[1:42:14] that are you ready for that do you
[1:42:17] really want that are you ready to
[1:42:19] surrender you all and take his
[1:42:21] instruction and his will not your will
[1:42:24] but his will
[1:42:26] he didn't know pain he didn't know a sin
[1:42:29] he didn't have to drown his troubles in
[1:42:31] worldly pleasures oh he was whole
[1:42:37] I understand in an attending church
[1:42:39] because it requires you to give up your
[1:42:42] ambition lots of money loss of
[1:42:45] popularity lust for big things
[1:42:47] dead to the believer because he'll want
[1:42:50] to be whole you want God to complete
[1:42:52] thing you don't need your job to compete
[1:42:54] you you don't need money to compete you
[1:42:56] you don't need your family to complete
[1:42:58] you you don't need music to come pick
[1:43:00] you the clothes you wear doesn't
[1:43:01] complete you showing up the church
[1:43:03] doesn't complete you
[1:43:06] your ideas don't complete you only God
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:13] Adam was whole oh God I want to be whole
[1:43:15] well now we made whole
[1:43:17] are you really willing to give up
[1:43:19] friends to people some people are
[1:43:21] completed with their friends when you
[1:43:22] pull their friends you recognize how
[1:43:24] empty they are like when Isaiah when
[1:43:26] King uziah was pulled back from him and
[1:43:28] he recognized he was standing there by
[1:43:29] himself
[1:43:33] only then you recognize wait a minute I
[1:43:35] need something more and when he fall
[1:43:37] asleep at the presence of God he said oh
[1:43:39] it's me
[1:43:40] he recognize I'm undone I'm incomplete I
[1:43:44] thought I was okay I taught us coming to
[1:43:46] church was enough I thought just believe
[1:43:48] in the message was enough I told you
[1:43:50] nobody recognized by missing something
[1:43:51] look at the Rich Young Ruler he said I
[1:43:54] followed all the Commandments I know all
[1:43:55] the law from my youth I had to do
[1:43:57] anything crazy what lack I yet no I'm
[1:44:00] not a whole I know I'm not complete I
[1:44:02] know I'm missing
[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:05] what lack I yet oh God I want to be
[1:44:09] whole
[1:44:10] and when Jesus told him
[1:44:13] what was required
[1:44:18] about his head
[1:44:20] and left
[1:44:24] sorrow because he wasn't prepared
[1:44:28] to give up
[1:44:29] to be whole
[1:44:32] is there anybody this morning you really
[1:44:34] you really you really sure
[1:44:39] because people tell me the show and then
[1:44:41] they close their way and the way they
[1:44:43] move on social media and the friends
[1:44:45] they have it's not in alignment with
[1:44:47] their profession
[1:44:50] do you conduct with your wife with your
[1:44:52] children with your balls with your
[1:44:54] co-workers is not it's not wholeness
[1:44:57] it's still you trying to compete
[1:44:59] yourself and your own
[1:45:02] and go through a stuff your way to test
[1:45:05] to see where you will lean if you were
[1:45:07] lean on him or lean on your own
[1:45:08] understanding because once you lean on
[1:45:10] your understand that's not a whole
[1:45:11] leaning on him his Holiness trusting in
[1:45:14] Him is wholeness relying on him as
[1:45:16] wholeness it's a simple message but oh
[1:45:18] God how many people miss it
[1:45:21] I'm gonna sit on a chair this morning
[1:45:23] thinking they're comfortable
[1:45:26] and they don't realize that they're
[1:45:28] blind wretched there's a rubble naked
[1:45:31] and they don't know it
[1:45:35] will thou be made whole
[1:45:40] Adam was Hollow to take us back to how
[1:45:43] Adam was before the fall I'm not going
[1:45:45] to be too much longer with you
[1:45:47] but look at Jesus he was whole and it
[1:45:49] was different still because he lived in
[1:45:51] a paradise
[1:45:52] there was no rock shop there was no bar
[1:45:54] there was no prostitutes there was
[1:45:56] nobody else around there was nothing but
[1:45:58] Jesus came with our sinful
[1:46:00] and he was tempted in every mile
[1:46:04] and he didn't sit and he was whole in a
[1:46:07] fallen World in a sinful world and he
[1:46:09] yet Satan could find no gaps no entry
[1:46:13] points no points of weakness because
[1:46:16] there was nowhere to break him because
[1:46:17] he was old a sealed unit oh when the
[1:46:21] prophet speaks about seal at the sealed
[1:46:24] Hall unit the devil can get in and the
[1:46:26] Holy Ghost can't get out or seal until
[1:46:29] the day of your Redemption well I'll be
[1:46:32] made home
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:37] it's a deep message
[1:46:40] Lot's wife started off good enough
[1:46:45] she followed the message
[1:46:47] she believed the message you know
[1:46:50] started walking on them she said goodbye
[1:46:52] World enough
[1:46:54] she was almost out of it you know she
[1:46:57] was ready and then and then it's as if
[1:46:59] the question will now be made whole
[1:47:03] Hallelujah and she wasn't ready
[1:47:06] there was still something in her heart
[1:47:08] against the very best teaching
[1:47:12] she witnessed angels I can imagine she's
[1:47:14] hearing the noise behind
[1:47:17] a Sodom is being destroyed
[1:47:20] what made her look back
[1:47:24] and they would say Don't Look Back are
[1:47:26] you sure you want to be made whole amen
[1:47:33] how many young people have certain Youth
[1:47:35] Services certain messages and we are
[1:47:38] where where are they now
[1:47:41] you bet oh God we need to pray for them
[1:47:45] we need to lift them up we don't hold
[1:47:47] any horns of the Altar for them we need
[1:47:49] to have mercy and say oh God don't
[1:47:52] forget them don't let their ways turn
[1:47:54] your your eyes away from them Lord
[1:47:57] don't hold it against them Lord
[1:48:03] Hallelujah
[1:48:05] like Moses Moses said don't judge a
[1:48:07] people
[1:48:08] remember you have remember what they
[1:48:09] said to Abraham remember what they said
[1:48:11] to Isaac remember Lord stay up and stay
[1:48:13] here and
[1:48:15] remember when Moses tried to stand
[1:48:16] between god like people
[1:48:20] say Lord have mercy have mercy
[1:48:23] they deserve to be struck that I'm not
[1:48:24] saying the door but that's remember you
[1:48:26] say it's your people
[1:48:28] remember you see it's your people
[1:48:30] remember missing your young people Lord
[1:48:32] they don't have a revelation yet but me
[1:48:34] by the grace of God some individuals
[1:48:37] break into the kingdom by saying Lord I
[1:48:39] want to be the it all
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:45] this is not the kind of jump and Shout
[1:48:47] for Joy kind of message but it's it's
[1:48:48] needed
[1:48:50] Jesus was whole and he was mocked
[1:48:53] he was old and he was laughed at he was
[1:48:56] ridiculed he was rejected John said he
[1:48:59] came under his own and his own received
[1:49:01] him not
[1:49:03] are you ready to stand the reproach of
[1:49:06] being whole
[1:49:09] the criticism of being whole they caught
[1:49:12] Jesus the devil and he was whole so what
[1:49:14] do you think what do you what experience
[1:49:16] you expect how was the of a believer
[1:49:20] foreign
[1:49:40] we sing the song to be like Jesus
[1:49:44] Jesus was whole that song really means
[1:49:46] you want to be holen a sealed unit a
[1:49:49] complete unit nothing missing
[1:49:53] to behold means you could forgive
[1:49:55] to be whole means you cherish your
[1:49:58] prayer life
[1:50:00] is it just a lip service that I want to
[1:50:02] be any messenger where is your prayer
[1:50:03] life because when you're old you have a
[1:50:05] prayer life
[1:50:06] and as the prophet lived he said he hung
[1:50:08] a cross in his castle when he saw the
[1:50:09] woman on the street he looked at the
[1:50:10] cross he wasn't trying to live a certain
[1:50:12] kind of life
[1:50:14] what are you doing to practice the
[1:50:16] presence of God that's what wholeness
[1:50:18] means can the Church Say Amen

[1:52:55] us and you are the word and the
[1:52:57] discerner of the thoughts of the heart
[1:52:59] this great decision of the thoughts of
[1:53:01] the heart stolen from the wrong man
[1:53:03] saying will thou remain whole because
[1:53:04] I've seen a little doubt in your heart
[1:53:07] I'm not saying you're unbelievable and a

[1:53:19] oh my
[1:53:20] there's a few more quotes is this
[1:53:22] helping anybody this morning
[1:53:24] this is that I cannot jump for Choice
[1:53:26] service but Jesus was ministering
[1:53:29] to this man
[1:53:31] in the message the unity of one God and
[1:53:34] no one should be done with unity home is
[1:53:36] completeness but the working of the Holy
[1:53:38] Spirit the kingdom of God in you God
[1:53:40] sets on the throne of your heart that's
[1:53:42] all in his control room controlling your
[1:53:45] emotions and controlling are you willing
[1:53:47] to give up control
[1:53:50] because giving up control many things
[1:53:52] you want to do you say well I'll give up
[1:53:54] control but many of us we want to do
[1:53:56] what we want to do
[1:53:57] I want to tell him I want to tell him
[1:53:59] how I feel about it and God is saying
[1:54:02] well if once you take over the control
[1:54:04] let me take over
[1:54:07] amen we want to get back at people we
[1:54:10] want to do what we want to do we want to
[1:54:11] have our own desires our own way our own
[1:54:13] approach
[1:54:15] but God set on the throne of your heart
[1:54:17] in his control room controlling your
[1:54:19] emotions controlling your powers
[1:54:21] controlling your conceptions and making
[1:54:24] you one with him in fellowship and in
[1:54:26] love and God filled you in love he
[1:54:29] filled you with power he fills you with
[1:54:31] the spirit he filled you with his own
[1:54:33] divine nature and it changes your kind
[1:54:35] of nature into his nature then in this
[1:54:38] you become a new creation in Christ
[1:54:42] foreign

[1:57:54] the god of their own imagination
[1:57:56] the way they think God should move and
[1:57:58] and how God should operate so they carve
[1:58:01] their lives a certain way

[1:59:02] condition now
[1:59:07] Jesus was addressing us
[1:59:09] State notice of that man but a state of
[1:59:12] a spiritual condition of people being
[1:59:14] physical in your church physically
[1:59:16] present they know God moving they know
[1:59:18] the price is coming they know they ain't
[1:59:20] just stir in the waters
[1:59:27] a new affection you don't love the

[1:59:40] have clothes for church and close for
[1:59:42] work I see any clothes on every exact
[1:59:44] same but his standard of it
[1:59:48] somebody must know one know if you're a
[1:59:49] Christian they must know you're
[1:59:50] Christian
[1:59:51] [Music]
[1:59:52] I had to show a tinch his kindness what
[1:59:56] does that mean
[2:00:00] do you have a Christian kind of
[2:00:02] background no no I wanted to be on the
[2:00:03] foreground
[2:00:07] let people don't get confused let it be
[2:00:09] very transparent
[2:00:11] we live in an age where people want to
[2:00:13] declare people declare pronouns they
[2:00:15] decline this they declare they want
[2:00:17] people to know what they are
[2:00:22] what is your declaration
[2:00:32] you don't care because you're born of
[2:00:34] above and you're affection are settling
[2:00:36] is above Gods not ashamed of you I'm
[2:00:39] just reading the quote here you know and
[2:00:40] you're not ashamed of him Are you
[2:00:42] ashamed of him
[2:00:46] can you pray comfortably in your work
[2:00:48] for your food
[2:00:51] I've seen Christians struggle with that
[2:00:53] same building
[2:00:56] they just have to pray for their music
[2:00:58] God bless Jesus baby
[2:01:02] you're trying to find a balance between
[2:01:05] praying and nobody's seeing you
[2:01:11] in my mind
[2:01:15] yeah yeah
[2:01:18] my mind the Lord knows my heart
[2:01:23] you know I've heard it I've heard it

[2:01:37] intentionally hard he know I wanted to
[2:01:38] blessed
[2:01:42] which will break
[2:01:47] but in that simple basic ABC principle
[2:01:50] because if you don't know that your
[2:01:52] effort is not what put food in a table
[2:01:54] and God put it there you have no problem
[2:01:55] saying Lord I Thank you for this week

[2:02:27] God because he said acknowledge Him in
[2:02:29] all your ways and he will direct your
[2:02:31] path and you want to be ashamed of him
[2:02:35] [Applause]

[2:08:13] whole complete satisfied anchored in the
[2:08:17] presence of God
[2:08:22] oh Hallelujah
[2:08:27] last quote before we wrap up with the
[2:08:30] scriptures that's the reason they're
[2:08:32] coming on the seals and the messenger
[2:08:34] guide at the finishing of the seventh
[2:08:36] seal the mystery of God shall be
[2:08:38] finished to know who God is what he is
[2:08:40] how he lives his nature his being you're
[2:08:43] supposed to be all the way up there by
[2:08:45] that time see bring us into the full
[2:08:47] stature of Sons and Daughters of God
[2:08:49] that's all false toucher means complete
[2:08:53] full stature mean ready for the
[2:08:55] headstone to jump down to see the whole
[2:08:57] thing
[2:08:58] [Applause]
[2:09:01] hear it it's for those who think is a
[2:09:04] Pentecostal message to preaching
[2:09:10] pregnancy the first touch
[2:09:12] Daughters of God a church that's washed
[2:09:15] in the blood of Christ that's brought
[2:09:16] without money is favored by the blood of
[2:09:18] Jesus Christ
[2:09:23] can we head to the home stretch
[2:09:28] let's go for a seven Saint John five or
[2:09:31] seven
[2:09:33] so after Jesus asked this man will thou
[2:09:36] be made whole but a punch you know what
[2:09:39] he said
[2:09:40] he said yes Lord
[2:09:43] I want to be made whole
[2:09:45] is that what you're seeing in your
[2:09:46] scriptures
[2:09:50] but the necklace could you help us get
[2:09:51] that that scripture up there
[2:09:55] Jesus asked the man and that's why the
[2:09:57] question is that an obvious question
[2:09:58] because you would think that if I say
[2:10:01] well though we may hold and say yes
[2:10:05] but nowhere in verse 7 we see the
[2:10:08] response yes
[2:10:13] I wonder how many in this room today
[2:10:15] would say yes or you will respond like
[2:10:18] this man
[2:10:20] sir I have no man
[2:10:23] when the water is troubled to put me
[2:10:26] into the pool
[2:10:28] so two things here at work firstly you
[2:10:31] say I hear but I need help yes
[2:10:35] I have no help I have nobody nobody for
[2:10:39] me I come here by myself some people
[2:10:42] here with their family but I hate by
[2:10:43] myself and nobody really look out for me
[2:10:45] I hear and nobody care and I have nobody
[2:10:48] and nobody and I have nobody and I have
[2:10:51] nobody and I have nobody that we sit
[2:10:53] here
[2:10:54] I have nobody
[2:10:56] so it's not my fault now it's the person
[2:10:58] who I'm supposed to have is their fault
[2:11:00] because if they had them the situation
[2:11:02] if I had some help
[2:11:09] and they know I was struggling
[2:11:16] excuses
[2:11:19] so instead of saying Lord I need help I
[2:11:22] want to be made whole this man start to
[2:11:25] bring excuses
[2:11:26] I have no man
[2:11:29] to his first excuse was I don't have the
[2:11:31] support system
[2:11:36] what is your issues you have an excuse
[2:11:38] this one
[2:11:40] a preached a person he has a word no
[2:11:42] more excuses
[2:11:43] and people today still I couldn't
[2:11:46] connect to this woman now because I had
[2:11:48] a meeting and I just and I immediated
[2:11:50] church because of this and a thing and a
[2:11:52] thing and the children get scammers so
[2:11:53] upset I had to calm down
[2:11:58] and it was a rough day and work it was
[2:12:00] rough days
[2:12:02] I stopped coming
[2:12:07] I'm not accepted he's supposed to be
[2:12:09] rough years
[2:12:11] but a recently with no excuses here it
[2:12:14] is
[2:12:15] Jesus asking the man will thou be made
[2:12:18] whole and his first responses it was
[2:12:20] more well if my wife to get your
[2:12:22] children ready for us
[2:12:25] or the food that is again no food
[2:12:31] and every Boston lemonly the time I
[2:12:33] wanted to leave at least I want to make
[2:12:34] it up time
[2:12:38] I have no man when the water is trouble
[2:12:40] to put me
[2:12:41] so you take yourself out of the effort
[2:12:43] you want somebody to put you in
[2:12:46] when the kingdom is preaching every man
[2:12:49] put me into the pool as the first one
[2:12:52] the first problem there the Nexus but
[2:12:54] while I'm coming
[2:12:57] so you're not saying but even when I try
[2:12:59] while I start to come
[2:13:01] another stepping down before me so this
[2:13:03] here was the University problem so he
[2:13:05] was there but not there because he
[2:13:06] didn't even believe
[2:13:08] that he could have made it
[2:13:13] his excuses Justified what Jesus noticed
[2:13:19] his response also showed that he wasn't
[2:13:22] even considering another possibility
[2:13:26] that the god of the angel that would
[2:13:28] Stir the Water could even visit him
[2:13:32] because his response about well done
[2:13:34] remain whole wasn't like Lord I want to
[2:13:36] be made whole and maybe if I against it
[2:13:39] there maybe God might visit me someday
[2:13:41] come to my house come to my court come
[2:13:44] to my mat maybe on my way home from
[2:13:46] church maybe on the way home from this
[2:13:48] Feast something can happen but no
[2:13:51] he who had closed all the possibilities
[2:13:55] but verse 8 is what I love about Jesus
[2:13:59] and this is why gurusi met this man
[2:14:04] Jesus didn't even acknowledge the man's
[2:14:06] response
[2:14:07] he rebuked the man for his response
[2:14:10] Jesus just said to him
[2:14:12] and this is what I love you though Jesus
[2:14:14] said
[2:14:15] you're healed go rejoicing he say rise
[2:14:20] yes brother Anthony he said do do
[2:14:23] something
[2:14:24] take up thy bed
[2:14:27] and walk
[2:14:31] all these years are coming to church
[2:14:33] what you do to be is rice
[2:14:36] take up your bed and start to walk there
[2:14:39] stop looking for help from somebody else
[2:14:42] stop looking for help to come from
[2:14:44] somebody else to do it for you I want
[2:14:46] you to rise take up your own bed
[2:14:49] [Applause]
[2:14:54] there's power in your hands to rise take
[2:14:59] up your bed it's not my bed it's your
[2:15:01] bed I'm not taking up your bed for you
[2:15:03] rise take up your bed and start to walk
[2:15:06] I wish I had a room this morning but
[2:15:08] over there to walk I don't think I have
[2:15:10] enough room to walk and I don't know but
[2:15:13] at all what came over this man because
[2:15:16] for 38 years he'll be doing the same
[2:15:19] thing but listen this message is
[2:15:22] something else because up to this point
[2:15:24] he didn't know who was talking to him
[2:15:26] I want us to appreciate that Jesus had
[2:15:28] not introduced himself
[2:15:30] but this man something triggered in him
[2:15:32] he began to reflect on his existence
[2:15:35] maybe it was the thing she said like La
[2:15:37] posa said whatever stay here and I might
[2:15:39] as well go on there and die but this man
[2:15:41] who he didn't know tell him rise
[2:15:45] take up your bed and walk and the Bible
[2:15:48] says and immediately it was on the next
[2:15:51] day it was only next five minutes it was
[2:15:54] nothing to do with the angel and
[2:15:55] immediate immediately the man was made
[2:15:57] whole and he took up his bed and he
[2:16:01] walked is there anybody this morning who
[2:16:04] is ready to rise take up your bed and
[2:16:06] walk out here healed is there anybody
[2:16:08] this morning maybe you didn't lift your
[2:16:10] hand in a long time but you're being
[2:16:12] encouraged to rise get under your feet
[2:16:15] oh God help me to kind of move a little
[2:16:17] bit this morning

[2:16:58] and he calls to him through the Thunder

[2:17:36] and immediately the man was made whole
[2:17:41] he took up his bed and walked
[2:17:43] and on the same day was he Sabbath

[2:17:51] Jews over the High Council

[2:20:46] this time most of the Miracles with not
[2:20:48] all Jesus did was in Galilee and some
[2:20:50] Mario hunting so they didn't know she
[2:20:53] didn't know about the kind of Miracle
[2:20:54] say which man which one I wanted to
[2:20:56] catch this nobody recognized them yeah
[2:21:00] coming in and nobody oh God did not
[2:21:04] recognize the reason they came to
[2:21:06] defeats was activists and they didn't
[2:21:08] recognize him this sheep Market did look
[2:21:11] at the trade ships and the Lamb of God
[2:21:13] didn't recognize him the House of Mercy
[2:21:16] Jesus walking and they didn't recognize
[2:21:19] him Jesus slipped him minister to a man
[2:21:22] and slipped out and didn't recognize you
[2:21:25] say which man is this
[2:21:27] [Applause]
[2:21:31] and verse 13.
[2:21:33] and he that was healed with not who it
[2:21:36] was
[2:21:37] he still didn't know for Jesus had
[2:21:40] conveyed himself away
[2:21:42] a multitude being in the place so Jesus
[2:21:46] healing man and disappeared
[2:21:49] left them all in the bag let the manhole
[2:21:52] in the mat
[2:21:54] oh God lead me to Holy mat leave me to
[2:21:57] hold my bed I can't explain this story I
[2:21:59] can't even tell you who did it I just
[2:22:01] know I'm not the same again
[2:22:02] [Applause]
[2:22:10] for free and this is what I love about
[2:22:13] this
[2:22:14] and this is why I said the issue was
[2:22:16] deeper than his physical healing it's
[2:22:18] confirmed here in scripture in verse 14.
[2:22:22] afterward
[2:22:24] Jesus finding him in the temple
[2:22:28] because Jesus knew there was something
[2:22:31] he had to say to this man
[2:22:34] and said unto him behold Thou Art made
[2:22:37] whole
[2:22:39] SIN number
[2:22:43] bless the worst thing come unto thee
[2:22:46] because apart from his physical sickness
[2:22:49] Jesus discerned some issues in his life
[2:22:55] Not only was he physically healed but
[2:22:58] the spiritual crippling
[2:23:00] held him for all these years God already
[2:23:02] dealt with it
[2:23:04] and God wanted him to know not only have
[2:23:06] I healed you in your body but yeah
[2:23:08] you're made whole enough
[2:23:11] I'll sin no more
[2:23:13] [Music]
[2:23:14] I know you didn't say yes I want to be
[2:23:17] made whole but you've been made all I'm
[2:23:20] challenging you don't go back the way
[2:23:22] you came don't go back
[2:23:25] don't go and sin anymore don't go back
[2:23:28] the way you used to live don't go back
[2:23:30] in your always
[2:23:32] I don't know this morning here in the
[2:23:34] Tabernacle who has issues physical what
[2:23:38] your issue is your challenge your issue
[2:23:40] I'm not I'm not trying to deserve that
[2:23:42] but the question still stands will not
[2:23:45] be made whole and if that great
[2:23:47] physician that great master was to move
[2:23:49] to this place and touch you and touch
[2:23:51] you and touch you I'm not talking about
[2:23:53] waiting for the angel now but the angel
[2:23:55] himself coming to you personally to
[2:23:59] minister to your need friends
[2:24:02] don't go back go sit no more don't go
[2:24:05] back into your always don't go back to
[2:24:07] your own life I want you to be sold out
[2:24:12] this message costs Jesus it was part of
[2:24:15] the plan but it cost Jesus
[2:24:16] [Music]
[2:24:18] 15.
[2:24:20] the man Departed
[2:24:22] and told the Jews that it was Jesus
[2:24:26] which made him whole
[2:24:30] maybe the man couldn't help himself
[2:24:32] he broke the covering on who it was
[2:24:36] and verse 16 and therefore did the Jews
[2:24:39] persecute Jesus
[2:24:41] and sought to slay him
[2:24:43] all of this
[2:24:44] at the of the cost that Jesus was paying
[2:24:47] to bring Redemption to bring healing
[2:24:50] this was a trial test or a first case of
[2:24:54] the cost to bring Salvation it cost to
[2:24:57] bring healing his persecution set in at
[2:25:00] that moment in Jerusalem
[2:25:07] and Jesus answered my father working
[2:25:10] Heather too when I work and that's why I
[2:25:12] said at the beginning this message was
[2:25:14] Jesus bringing ministering healing and
[2:25:16] Doctrine the moment you they begin to
[2:25:19] speak in verse 17 he said my father
[2:25:21] worked hitherto when I work Doctrine my
[2:25:24] father
[2:25:25] and I he started at Verse 18 therefore
[2:25:28] the Jews sought the more to kill him
[2:25:30] because he not only had broken the
[2:25:32] Sabbath but said author of God was his
[2:25:35] father making himself equal with God so
[2:25:39] God take the Jesus I just had to bring
[2:25:40] Doctrine to them a minister to a man who
[2:25:43] needed ministering I brought heal into a
[2:25:45] man need healing and now I'm gonna bring
[2:25:48] some Doctrine
[2:25:50] verse 19 Jesus then after Jesus and send
[2:25:53] them verily verily I say unto you the
[2:25:55] sun can do nothing of himself
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:25:59] but what he said the father do for what
[2:26:02] things however he do with these also do
[2:26:04] it the sun likewise so he will start to
[2:26:06] get deeper you see what you see me doing
[2:26:08] is because he fight over me to do it so
[2:26:10] if you have a problem with this man who
[2:26:12] was healed don't just stick it up with
[2:26:14] me take it up
[2:26:15] because I am my father all one you don't
[2:26:17] hear me this morning I know who I am you
[2:26:20] can't cheat me you can persecute me but
[2:26:23] he was whole
[2:26:25] I'm finished this morning may the Lord
[2:26:29] will she bless you
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:38] [Music]
[2:26:51] like wherever the Gideon comes I don't
[2:26:53] want to necessarily make an autopall but
[2:26:55] where you are right now when you see
[2:26:57] them whenever you hear about every that
[2:26:58] goes
[2:26:58] [Music]
[2:27:02] I preached a message some months ago
[2:27:05] what will your answer be
[2:27:07] [Music]
[2:27:11] if you were to meet the Lord this
[2:27:12] morning and he would ask you the
[2:27:14] question will that be made all what will
[2:27:16] your answer be
[2:27:19] will you give him excuses
[2:27:22] because this is the Anchor Point for us
[2:27:26] Grace met this man
[2:27:28] hope met this man kindness met this man
[2:27:33] the Messiah met this man Christ
[2:27:37] as well
[2:27:38] back then he overlooked he overlooked
[2:27:42] the word that came out of his mouth
[2:27:43] because God had someone to prove
[2:27:46] friends it will not always have Grace
[2:27:49] it will not always have mercy it's a
[2:27:51] judgment seat but because there's blood
[2:27:55] on the Judgment seated as a mercy seat
[2:27:59] oh may this be a House of Mercy this
[2:28:02] morning
[2:28:02] [Music]
[2:28:06] this morning message believer for 38
[2:28:09] years 38 months 10 years 20 years lost
[2:28:13] disease lost the joy you in church
[2:28:16] no burden if it happens it happens oh
[2:28:20] God help us
