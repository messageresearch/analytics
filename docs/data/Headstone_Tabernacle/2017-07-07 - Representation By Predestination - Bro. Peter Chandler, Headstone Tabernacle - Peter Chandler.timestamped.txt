[53:58] during these times and I could not

[54:04] at their little screen they got their
[54:05] CNN or whatever it was and I had to
[54:09] mention to brother Colin when I said
[54:10] look at this
[54:11] I saw puttin shaking hands with Donald
[54:14] Trump I right there on the screen I said

[54:33] time man amen praise be to God
[54:37] so the Lord richly bless you shall we
[54:40] stand to our feet as we go for a short
[54:43] time in the Word of God I meant a little
[54:45] message I brought to my church last
[54:46] Sunday it just took me about it over an
[54:49] hour with translation so we shall be too
[54:52] long today but you want to speak on a
[54:54] great subject called representation by
[54:59] predestination while I'm going into it
[55:02] if I do this that by the Isaac knows
[55:04] that means to go on to the next slide I
[55:06] bust our little pictures as well because
[55:09] some young people come to me they say
[55:10] you know pasta those little pictures
[55:12] help me to kind of understand when you a
[55:15] picture says a thousand words you know
[55:18] so are you fine right through our do
[55:20] little pictures to kind of bring it home
[55:22] to help our little fellas to kind of get
[55:25] them to grab the inspiration let's go
[55:27] over to the scriptures brother Isaac and
[55:29] I think I can just read them from here a
[55:31] few directional scriptures there and you
[55:33] will say to me yes they're well-known
[55:34] but sometimes you can do something you
[55:38] know it well but then some one day the
[55:40] fire strikes it amen and it just becomes
[55:43] alive so st. Luke 10 remembering the
[55:46] subject representation by predestination
[55:51] Luke 2010 20 if you join me there
[55:55] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[55:59] that the spirits are subject to you I
[56:01] mean that's one of
[56:03] but rather rejoice because your names
[56:07] are written in heaven Romans 8:15 for ye
[56:15] have not received the spirit of bondage
[56:18] again to fear but you have received the
[56:22] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[56:27] Father amen and verse 29 of the same
[56:32] chapter goes on to say for whom he did
[56:36] foreknow also did he did predestinate to
[56:42] be conformed to the image of his son
[56:46] that he might be the firstborn among
[56:49] many brethren jumping to verse 30
[56:52] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[56:56] he also called whom he called he
[56:59] justified and whom he justified them he
[57:02] also glorified
[57:04] my and finally Ephesians 1:5 and in a
[57:08] beautiful scripture for today having
[57:10] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[57:16] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[57:21] according to the good pleasure of his
[57:25] will the church said amen
[57:27] let us bow our heads gracious almighty
[57:31] god I just feel so happy today just to
[57:35] be gathered Lord as the pastor has
[57:37] mentioned that holy convocation Lord and
[57:40] how brother branham has scented Lord

[1:25:15] God I mean let's go into somebody tell
[1:25:18] me the title there what's it called
[1:25:21] let's go back now to Adam because Adam
[1:25:24] caused this whole thing were you there
[1:25:27] when Adam sinned you see he did it he
[1:25:31] did it you know you but you were
[1:25:33] affected you came under that
[1:25:37] representation not true condemnation is
[1:25:40] that's all right shout Amen to me
[1:25:42] Amen many times I've heard people say
[1:25:45] listen brother branham Adam and Eve did
[1:25:47] the evil and that's just true the hybrid
[1:25:51] the Word of God that's true they
[1:25:52] reasoned and caused us to get into this
[1:25:55] condition it's good God is unjust that
[1:25:58] he condemns me I never did that brother
[1:26:00] bad it was Adam not sinned I was born in
[1:26:03] shape a shape in iniquity somebody
[1:26:06] represented me amen and here's a thought
[1:26:10] he says you're condemned because Adam
[1:26:14] condemned you and condemned the world
[1:26:17] that's fair comment that is condemnation
[1:26:19] by representing thank God it doesn't
[1:26:23] stop there let's go one more brother
[1:26:25] Isaac amen he says you are a sinner by
[1:26:29] representation amen
[1:26:31] you're a sinner by representation he
[1:26:34] hold but he says he does he doesn't hold
[1:26:37] you responsible for being a sinner but
[1:26:40] he holds you responsible because you
[1:26:43] don't help yourself
[1:26:45] because there's a way being made for you
[1:26:50] and if you reject that way then God
[1:26:53] condemns you let's go on brother I sake
[1:26:56] there's a way May sorry this is a shock
[1:26:58] of a picture but let's be shocked that
[1:27:00] Christ has died for us he says Adam and
[1:27:04] Eve represented me as a sinner but Jesus
[1:27:08] came to represent us also we are under
[1:27:14] another representation the
[1:27:16] representation of the last Adam which is
[1:27:18] Jesus Christ hallelujah he came to
[1:27:22] represent us - amen let's go one brother
[1:27:24] Isaac hallelujah he says he says now you
[1:27:28] that says it's wrong to be represented
[1:27:31] by Adam as a sinner
[1:27:32] what about representation we have
[1:27:35] salvation the same way Adam condemned us
[1:27:39] Christ has justified us if we accept the
[1:27:44] way that's been made God's only provided
[1:27:46] way how are we ever gonna be saved one
[1:27:51] come to represent us and his name is
[1:27:55] Jesus he came to represent us before God
[1:27:58] as sons and daughters of God he sent His
[1:28:02] Holy Spirit hallelujah but if you don't
[1:28:05] help yourself
[1:28:05] then he then god condemns you but if you
[1:28:08] receive this way he will bless you let's
[1:28:11] go on brother Isaac he says now he says
[1:28:14] you talk about a Jubilee you talk about
[1:28:17] a time when that lamb walked forth
[1:28:20] because he is our representative
[1:28:23] everybody was waiting john was weeping
[1:28:26] because there was no representative but
[1:28:29] then his representative came out let's
[1:28:32] go there Eliza amen
[1:28:33] he says the first thing that represented
[1:28:36] Kamisha represented
[1:28:38] that Redemption was the lamb that had
[1:28:42] been slain from the foundation of the
[1:28:43] world he was the kinsman redeemer can we
[1:28:48] all shout kinsman redeemer he was not
[1:28:51] the kinsman reformer he was up a king's
[1:28:56] man legalist hey man he was not the
[1:28:59] Kings man preacher he was the kinsman
[1:29:01] redeemer and he's gonna redeem her young
[1:29:05] people he's gonna redeem you let's clap
[1:29:07] those hands and shout amen
[1:29:09] he's gonna redeem you hallelujah hey man
[1:29:13] and joy he took the glory a man and he
[1:29:18] opened the book and he tore off the
[1:29:20] seals amen and sent it down to the earth
[1:29:23] to his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:29:25] people
[1:29:25] hallelujah he was how representation no
[1:29:29] man was worthy no man was worthy to read
[1:29:32] the book no man was worthy to even touch
[1:29:34] the book but Jesus was our
[1:29:36] representation by predestination
[1:29:40] hallelujah hallelujah let's go to allies
[1:29:43] like a man came in and brother when we
[1:29:46] get up there I tell you I thought I put
[1:29:48] this in brother over it is so sweet over
[1:29:50] here every minister will stand on his
[1:29:52] ministry with his congregation and the
[1:29:55] question will be asked I mean he said
[1:29:57] the angel that was speaking said well
[1:29:59] Paul after stand-to said yes he said I
[1:30:02] know I'm all right
[1:30:03] because I've preached the same word that
[1:30:05] Paul has preached
[1:30:07] and when I did that millions screamed
[1:30:10] out that's where we're resting that's
[1:30:14] where we're resting and church let me
[1:30:16] tell you I'm arresting in the
[1:30:19] representation of predestination
[1:30:22] provided by Jesus Christ and that is the
[1:30:26] word of God whenever that prophet said I
[1:30:28] believe it
[1:30:30] hallelujah with all of my heart amen
[1:30:33] amen let's move on praise be to God
[1:30:35] let's see a man he says God don't hold
[1:30:38] you responsible for being a sinner he
[1:30:41] won't hold you responsible from now on
[1:30:42] but he holds you responsible if you
[1:30:46] reject us when these guys start to
