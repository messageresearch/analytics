[25:58] to unfold you too hallelujah I I could
[26:06] like I feel like embracing everybody
[26:09] here hallelujah
[26:14] you coming from the letters of the book
[26:22] into this story itself Paul said in
[26:26] Ephesians he wrote it in Thessalonica
[26:31] right after the rapture he spoke about
[26:34] the rapture next chapter is that ye are
[26:37] the children of light in children of the
[26:40] day this is the day that is coming to us
[26:47] in MIT my TV because it just standing
[26:51] there and a lot of God will drop down
[26:54] this is a day this glorious day and I
[27:01] think I'm on a birth of my son Daniel he
[27:06] came out a different way halfway inside
[27:10] the head out and started to pray and the
[27:17] doctor said if I would not have seen it
[27:20] I would not believe it
[27:22] brothers some are not totally out on a
[27:27] born in this world in this new kingdom
[27:31] but make a quick at least thank him
[27:36] thank him for the glory his glory came
[27:40] down
[27:41] what is his glory his salvation that
[27:45] says music is Oh glorious for me that
[27:48] opens to me the scripture let's
[27:51] experience healing although from Horizon
[27:55] to Horizon there's no sin in that places
[27:59] you believe it adult Lorien is a new day
[28:03] there's no spin in your family if
[28:07] brother Brent spoke about all fishermen
[28:09] he said he couldn't see only God he only
[28:14] saw God everywhere do you see it in your
[28:18] life
[28:19] you see it in your wife you see it in
[28:21] your possible and your brother and your
[28:23] sister this is a new name
[28:25] you see God everywhere however I am so
[28:30] happy for this inspiration said our our
[28:34] brother head glory and salvation Hawkins
[28:38] healing for my entire being we realize
[28:43] this new day we find ourselves as
[28:46] children of the state who you is it
[28:50] sinking down in your heart you are a
[28:53] child of this new day this is so true
[28:58] but sister the problem is programmed
[29:01] told that many times we we are too
[29:05] fearful to let our soul go when you hear
[29:11] the promise let your soul just fly and
[29:16] God will do the rest you young people
[29:19] let your soul fly away to the promised
[29:23] just you don't have to understand just
[29:27] just believe Mary she believes and it
[29:31] happened to them
[29:32] hallelujah so part of us may still be
[29:37] connected with the old world system
[29:39] shadows and darkness of the body of this
[29:42] else but listen God's child will not
[29:44] stay forever in there it's coming out
[29:48] into that new day Paul preached about
[29:52] this Paul wrote about this brother
[29:55] Brennan spoke about this and this is a
[29:57] Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God and I'm
[30:02] looking forward that it opens in a
[30:04] mighty way as never before
[30:07] this new day so what will we do when
[30:11] when we are sticking out with a head
[30:13] sticking out is our heart we begin to
[30:16] unfold like the lily we let our soul
[30:18] loose in this glorious reality says
[30:22] nobody can stop us we broke through in
[30:26] this glorious light and aside in divide
[30:28] and divide and divide and abide however
[30:33] just love the Lord and I'm finishing
[30:37] right by soon when the Sun comes up you
[30:42] don't need the moon anymore what a
[30:47] fellowship when your old life moves away
[30:51] passing through the broken blood from
[30:54] death unto life a land flowing with milk
[30:57] and honey okay milk you've got the real
[31:01] gospel Milligan the real honey we

[31:35] holding up to the world cut loose our
[31:37] souls will slow freely cortex controlled
[31:41] and lead us and we will not try to think
[31:43] for ourselves young people don't try to
[31:47] think for yourselves but if you just
[31:51] think you're sixteen elements and the
[31:54] Holy Ghost is good this is a good editor
[31:57] we can come down into his word something
[32:01] inside of us cut loose and we begin to
[32:04] float out yonder by face knowing sins
[32:07] are all parts this is the wonderful
[32:11] dimension it's past it's fast raising up
[32:17] higher and higher if you these effect

[51:36] verse three Ephesians 1 and verse 3
[51:47] blessed be the God and father of our
[51:50] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[51:53] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[51:55] places in Christ according as he had
[51:58] chosen us in him before the foundation
[52:00] of the world that we should be holy and
[52:03] without blame before him in love having
[52:06] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[52:09] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[52:11] according to the good pleasure of his
[52:14] will to the praise of the glory of His
[52:17] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[52:19] in the beloved in whom we have
[52:22] redemption through his blood the
[52:23] forgiveness of sins according to the
[52:26] riches of His grace wherein he has
[52:29] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[52:32] prudence having me known unto us the
[52:34] mystery of his will according to his
[52:36] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[52:39] himself that in the dispensation of the
[52:42] fullness of times he might gather
[52:43] together in one all things in Christ
[52:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[52:48] on it
[52:49] even in him in who also we have obtained
[52:52] an inherent inheritance being
[52:54] predestinated according to the purpose
[52:56] of him who worketh all things after the
[52:59] counsel of his own will
[53:02] may the Lord a blessing to the reading
[53:04] of his word carry bow our heads for wit
[53:06] of Prayer heavenly father any man could
[53:09] read the scriptures but it takes the
[53:11] Holy Ghost to breathe life upon his
[53:13] father Lord may you speak to your people
[53:15] tonight me use me as your instrument
[53:17] Lord me you annoying the words of what
[53:20] we said may you bless the word
[53:22] and the reading of the word Lord and
[53:23] open our understanding Lord me tonight

[53:28] your Holy Spirit take complete charge
[53:30] tonight in the precious name of Jesus
[53:32] Christ and the church says amen and amen
[53:35] you may be seated
[53:37] so I have a title tonight it's
[53:40] possessing your individual inheritance
[53:43] and I have a subject another holy time
[53:47] is here and I have an inspiration the
[53:49] higher law of the eighth day the higher
[53:53] law of the East D and in a message
[53:55] personal experience with God with the
[53:58] random cell what we need today is a good
[54:00] old fashioned seeing Paul's revival and
[54:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost like fell
[54:07] on the day of Pentecost to bring a
[54:09] people back to a living faith in God
[54:11] again that's exactly I believe in
[54:14] confessions to raise up and accept Jesus
[54:17] Christ as good I believe in all that but
[54:19] friends we need something more than that
[54:21] so I believe this meeting and my design
[54:24] my heart is to have more than just a
[54:26] service more than just a meeting but an
[54:28] experience with the supernatural with
[54:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:32] like they had on a team of Pentecost
[54:35] them but the Branham said the thing of
[54:36] Pentecost was the a better day of
[54:39] Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on the
[54:41] eighth day so I'm happy to be identified
[54:44] with an eighty holy convocation and you
[54:48] know that Aaron's rod was dead for years
[54:50] but when it was left overnight in the
[54:52] presence of God it brought what buzz
[54:55] blossom and brought forth fruit because
[54:57] it was in the right place it was they
[54:59] are the right time and something has to
[55:02] happen and whenever you are in the right
[55:04] place at the right time something has
[55:06] got to happen now Aaron's rod could have
[55:11] only brought forth what was the genetic
[55:13] code of that rod and rather than a broad
[55:16] four coconuts it could not have brought
[55:18] four apples it has to be whatever that
[55:20] rod was so even though the rod was bare
[55:23] that it looked like it has no life the
[55:26] genetic structure of the
[55:28] have not been compromised genetic
[55:30] structure of the rod has not been
[55:32] brought under the netting structure of
[55:35] the rod have not been tampered with them
[55:37] maybe you come to this meeting looking
[55:39] to get something more than yesterday but
[55:41] maybe you are tired maybe you are
[55:43] wearing maybe you are frustrated I have
[55:45] good news for you the genetic code that
[55:48] have been written inside your genes have
[55:51] not been damaged it has not been
[55:53] compromised
[55:54] if I look dry but son of man have these
[55:57] dry bones live on a man and this rod
[56:00] come back to life then the church came
[56:04] and so I've got the news for you God

[1:05:12] brought the order and we know the Holy
[1:05:15] Ghost is the enforcer but even though

[1:08:37] can't imagine only loud wonderful you
[1:08:41] may be seated
[1:08:43] why did you do that but I say become we
[1:08:46] need some more young people look at they
[1:08:47] no note that there was offer whatever he
[1:08:51] brings to you you respond to no I don't
[1:08:54] see how good I look it's no why because
[1:08:56] I'm on a destination to a different
[1:08:59] place
[1:08:59] I don't want your offer I don't want
[1:09:02] what you're given to me I don't want it
[1:09:03] because I don't belong here
[1:09:05] I'm not going to be satisfied that was a
[1:09:08] warrant offered because I'm a creature
[1:09:10] of eternity only eternal peace that
[1:09:14] satisfy me and the church payment Oh
[1:09:18] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:09:24] for a minute
[1:09:26] so I was looking at that scripture I'm
[1:09:31] not eating a holy convocation it says a
[1:09:34] powerful tool it
[1:09:35] there'll be no servile work therein and
[1:09:39] I just was meditating on that no servile
[1:09:42] work therein and I went to do some
[1:09:44] research in at work survived and what
[1:09:46] that servile work means and that would
[1:09:49] servile is connected to slavery so it
[1:09:52] means when that if they comes it means
[1:09:55] your day of doing stuff that you are
[1:09:58] forced to do is over and many young
[1:10:00] people say I want to give up this and I
[1:10:03] want to stop doing better my heart wants
[1:10:06] to do the right thing
[1:10:07] more than that servile work is defined
[1:10:10] as when there's a job to do and there's
[1:10:14] a physical component and a mental
[1:10:16] component but the physical component far
[1:10:18] exceeds the mental so it's when you're
[1:10:22] working almost like a drone you're
[1:10:24] working because you are forced to work
[1:10:26] you're working because you are pressured
[1:10:28] to do it without having to think about
[1:10:31] it that's how the children of Israel
[1:10:34] were in Egypt it was servile work it was
[1:10:38] not their creativity it was not their
[1:10:39] ideas they will posture bring
[1:10:42] the ideas that the Egyptians wanted but
[1:10:45] when he is there come it's a different
[1:10:47] day altogether there's no more survivors
[1:10:50] there's no more doing what the devil
[1:10:54] wants you to do there's no more
[1:10:56] taskmaster there's no more you have to
[1:10:59] smoke you have to drink it you have to
[1:11:01] love you have to have jealousy no no no
[1:11:04] no no no no more survivor parent that is
[1:11:07] your needs we breathe when that a big
[1:11:10] hunk it's actually time you can put down
[1:11:14] your tools that you have been working
[1:11:16] with and you can claim back your
[1:11:18] inheritance because it be evening
[1:11:21] give no more work in that me so I
[1:11:24] declare tonight that in the only time if
[1:11:27] another truly who the bride of Jesus
[1:11:29] Christ and the devil that I've been
[1:11:32] holding you they have got to let you go
[1:11:34] o blessed be the name of the Lord you
[1:11:40] may be feeling what do you say my Isaac
[1:11:42] the Egyptians we see today you will see
[1:11:45] them no more forever it's time I put a
[1:11:48] devil he has had in case the operator
[1:11:50] for the devil and I thought into that 18
[1:11:53] he cannot go with the eternity he has no
[1:11:56] access to that world because it is your
[1:11:59] world it is your kingdom and the church
[1:12:02] demon Oh hallelujah mine on my ume
[1:12:08] shilling
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:11] hallelujah second Chronicles 7:14 says
[1:12:15] if my people which are called by my name
[1:12:18] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:12:21] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:12:24] ways then will I hear from heaven and
[1:12:27] will forgive their sin and will heal
[1:12:29] their land
[1:12:30] if my people and the first time the
[1:12:34] Bible uses my people is in Exodus 3 7
[1:12:37] when the Bible says and a lot that I
[1:12:39] have surely seen the affliction of my
[1:12:41] people which are in Egypt and observe
[1:12:44] their cry by reason of the attachment
[1:12:47] during Noah's sorrows I want you to
[1:12:50] understand friends that God had already
[1:12:53] promised their deliverance but even
[1:12:55] though there was a promise over them he
[1:12:57] still have to wait till he hear the
[1:12:59] cries of the people and when he heard
[1:13:01] the cries he remembered the promise it
[1:13:04] was under the tax masses under the slave
[1:13:07] masters who kept them to anything that
[1:13:10] they didn't want to do because they were
[1:13:12] forced to do it the taskmaster was
[1:13:15] keeping them doing the sin and the
[1:13:17] bondage and the building or whatever it
[1:13:19] is so whenever you don't feel Ike
[1:13:20] worshipping it because it's a taskmaster
[1:13:23] and you you shouldn't worship when you
[1:13:26] don't see like rain it's because it's a
[1:13:28] mass of that's over you and you don't
[1:13:32] breathe because it's ABS method to
[1:13:34] control your timer the path master
[1:13:37] control when you wake up in the morning
[1:13:40] master
[1:13:41] hell you want to eat the wizard master
[1:13:43] tell you what time to go together and
[1:13:46] the cheerin of either the tire of the
[1:13:49] pack master is telling them to get up in
[1:13:51] the morning I'm going to this person I
[1:13:54] get up in the air going to that and the
[1:13:56] fact master was too much until the
[1:14:00] terminal things are being a prize
[1:14:02] they're going to sign and as we begin a
[1:14:05] crime God began together and clapping as
[1:14:09] a hero and the noise came up to God and
[1:14:12] God listen have to do something about it
[1:14:16] he couldn t hear it and not do anything
[1:14:18] about it
[1:14:19] because he hear it and leave them alone
[1:14:21] because God had to respond to the call
[1:14:24] and the church payment Holloway repeated
[1:14:29] and two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:14:33] two hundred thousand thousand
[1:14:35] taskmasters have been assigned to stop
[1:14:38] you from hearing this message
[1:14:42] the turn of Israel were born into
[1:14:45] slavery in Egypt yet as we were born
[1:14:48] into sin because of Adam and the past
[1:14:51] masters have been with us in our schools
[1:14:52] and the jobs but it has always been a
[1:14:55] covenant that is a freedom coming yes in
[1:14:58] a covenant not a deliverer always coming
[1:15:00] there's a covenant that there's an
[1:15:03] opportunity coming to get out of here
[1:15:05] fear of what you would have had him
[1:15:07] forever but God made a promise here or
[1:15:10] did not know that it was a time limit on
[1:15:13] his operations here I didn't know that
[1:15:15] he was operating under the constraint of
[1:15:18] time but God's promise doesn't limit
[1:15:21] itself like time so God knew his people
[1:15:24] had to come out of Egypt he would be
[1:15:27] Emperor season this was yet destination
[1:15:29] was not Egypt there was an inheritance
[1:15:32] that they had to go to and whatever God
[1:15:34] had to do he was going to do to get them
[1:15:36] out and the church came it you may be
[1:15:42] seated
[1:15:43] and I could imagine that Pharaoh I've
[1:15:45] heard a rumor that a deliverer was
[1:15:47] coming they needed some money coming as
[1:15:50] a rumor coming and it was only a rumor
[1:15:52] but there came a time like no other time
[1:15:54] when God had to do something and Moses
[1:15:58] came on the scene but I want to be clear
[1:16:00] tonight that tonight we did time up
[1:16:02] Satan time up Pharaoh
[1:16:04] we have seen our names we know who we
[1:16:07] are
[1:16:07] we know our promises we know what our
[1:16:10] heritance is we know this is our team so
[1:16:13] break out of the change to bring out of
[1:16:16] the shackles to put down our thousands
[1:16:19] to put down our tools and head to the
[1:16:22] promised land
[1:16:23] these I'm talking to stop the life he's
[1:16:25] taught me to stop you but that life and
[1:16:28] you can never be stopped
[1:16:29] and the chest Amen somebody gives a lot
[1:16:32] of shout of praise
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:42] you may be seated
[1:16:45] friends we are not promised a system

[1:17:51] kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot
[1:17:53] be shook or move that's the kingdom of
[1:17:56] God not a system not a political will
[1:17:59] not a denomination but a kingdom and if
[1:18:02] subjects are dead the systems of this
[1:18:05] world that would be the corner men I was
[1:18:07] talking about gather the de systems of
[1:18:10] this world is subject as dead that these
[1:18:12] organizations is their cities political
[1:18:15] systems and now we are in this kingdom a
[1:18:18] kingdom that Kennedy moves all these

[1:19:06] the end a thirty six seven days shall
[1:19:08] you offer offerings made of fire under

[1:19:16] holy time coming fully convocation unto
[1:19:19] you and you shall offer an offering made
[1:19:21] by fire unto the Lord and it is a solemn
[1:19:24] assembly and you shall do no servile
[1:19:27] work there is and now we got an
[1:19:29] eight-piece now there's only seven days
[1:19:31] but here we speak of the easy holy
[1:19:33] convocation do no work in it it is what
[1:19:37] back to the verses it speaks of eternity
[1:19:40] now he is he Jesus rings for
[1:19:43] justification he eternal King with
[1:19:46] eternal signal to be baptized include to
[1:19:50] eternal life

[1:20:40] happening at home it has nothing to do
[1:20:42] with your problems

[1:21:09] never started on anything he wasn't
[1:21:12] fazed on anything you was always taste
[1:21:15] he's have come to redeem that but you
[1:21:18] will say from the beginning because you
[1:21:20] had eternal life to begin with somebody

[1:21:27] to begin with you may be seated
[1:21:31] not only have some people they can
[1:21:34] understand this excitement that you had

[1:21:38] know you have your trouble then you have
[1:21:40] your child and you're you're testing
[1:21:42] what utility you talking about if you
[1:21:44] know what my reality is you ain't tell
[1:21:46] me about eternity
[1:21:47] but I'm telling you there is a greater
[1:21:49] reality than your present reality you
[1:21:52] were always in God you were always in
[1:21:56] God if your memory could go back to
[1:21:58] before there was a moon before there was
[1:22:01] a God has a reacts of the factors where
[1:22:04] was now when I lay the foundations of
[1:22:07] the earth such talk is memory so where

[1:22:42] that we have lived through all these
[1:22:44] types in here but when you hit the edge

[1:22:49] my lord and rituals and orders you come
[1:22:54] by protecting me there's a genuine holy
[1:23:01] convocation and we are ending the seven
[1:23:04] churches churches of Pentecostal is you

[1:23:09] convocation we are entering into the
[1:23:12] real genuine eternity where the church
[1:23:16] is called not the temptation some
[1:23:19] denomination but into eternity your
[1:23:22] calling and into eternity with the
[1:23:25] eternal King my to the AP what does it

[1:24:11] treated with charity you can be walking
[1:24:14] the earth but you are infinitely walking
[1:24:17] under you eternity
[1:24:18] walking into the eternity walking on
[1:24:22] your charm eternity support to come back
[1:24:26] eternity to look at the strong assess if
[1:24:29] we tell that eternity
[1:24:32] eternity will be real enough people
[1:24:34] unwanted at eternity put on put on left
[1:24:39] and this model will be immortality and
[1:24:43] will be changed in a moment in the
[1:24:44] twinkling of an eye
[1:24:46] oh can attest a man he is he mean that
[1:24:51] all that Adam Lanza is coming back that
[1:24:54] a manifested comes of course it
[1:24:56] shouldn't happen in the first day it
[1:24:58] wouldn't happen in the second day it
[1:25:00] couldn't happen in the Baldy what in
[1:25:02] Disney now after the seven days in a
[1:25:06] bride age is the eight days robot has no
[1:25:09] devil yes no demon there's no spirit get
[1:25:13] those pills there's no doubt there's no
[1:25:15] unbeliever yes nothing to stop the fries
[1:25:18] from taking her position this is nothing
[1:25:21] to stop the prize from possessing these
[1:25:23] are individual inheritance
[1:25:31] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:36] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:25:40] hallelujah my my my my my you see before
[1:25:44] Adam self Adam was living in eternity
[1:25:50] there was no death there was no sickness
[1:25:53] are you with me Adam didn't know what
[1:25:57] that was he didn't know what thickness
[1:25:59] was he didn't know what it was to be
[1:26:01] depressed all Adam knew to do but if he
[1:26:04] didn't like weather mountain once he
[1:26:06] could move the mountain a little bit if
[1:26:08] you wanted to talk with a lion you can
[1:26:10] call a lion over Adam have perfect
[1:26:12] Dominion control but when Adam fell
[1:26:17] it brought time and it broke out of
[1:26:22] eternity so it be brings us back into
[1:26:27] the ability but I want to get it here's
[1:26:30] a different law when you're in time then
[1:26:33] when you are into eternity and the
[1:26:36] tournament because in time you have
[1:26:38] gravity so when Ibrahim said at the Rec
[1:26:44] book here when you lift your hand you
[1:26:47] are defying the law you will defy the
[1:26:51] laws of gravity so it means whatever
[1:26:54] laws exist and time can be defined by a
[1:26:57] higher law
[1:27:00] here's a lord a coven 217 and it's a
[1:27:04] different law pretty easy so when you in
[1:27:07] the seven-day law you and that time but
[1:27:12] in that seven-day law somebody could be
[1:27:14] dead
[1:27:14] but when you bring the ad in contact
[1:27:17] with the 17 law that dead life forget
[1:27:22] string from the is be doin Jesus stood
[1:27:25] outside of the tomb of Lazarus they were
[1:27:28] in time but he's a creature of abilities
[1:27:30] he could sleep from the eternal the
[1:27:38] power that was open what the seventh is
[1:27:40] our what it is our was another place
[1:27:44] that was or not even sometimes and even
[1:27:48] Lazarus comport Lazarus already left
[1:27:52] what that voice was able to cut through
[1:27:55] dimension spiral Lazarus was traveling
[1:28:04] because it was a higher law and the
[1:28:10] church payments you may be seated
[1:28:12] and whenever there is a law mister
[1:28:15] seventy law it brings a seventy laws
[1:28:17] under subjection so Stephen is sleeping
[1:28:20] on the boat the boat is something the 70
[1:28:23] law and the Windham and the storm come
[1:28:28] he's it is sleeping he is tired
[1:28:31] that is I was out frustrated what are we
[1:28:34] going to do there wake his ass up Jesus
[1:28:37] looked at the stone he looked at the sky
[1:28:40] he looked at them and he never eats the
[1:28:43] eternal world water from a language
[1:28:45] spoken on the eighth day and I said he
[1:28:49] please kill and when that strong heard
[1:28:52] those words and recognizing what that
[1:28:55] man's vision that was at 70 law that was
[1:28:58] the law being
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] you may be seated young people that's
[1:29:09] why you are going to make it I'm not
[1:29:11] going to get the Holy Ghost because of
[1:29:13] eating your soul it's not a natural fear
[1:29:16] it's a repeat of these seven names
[1:29:19] it's a eternal see that seed never had a
[1:29:22] beginning never has an ending for your
[1:29:25] predestination is stronger than your
[1:29:28] trials your predestination is stronger
[1:29:31] than your mistakes your predestination
[1:29:34] is stronger than your failures your
[1:29:37] predestination and stronger than the
[1:29:39] table without power you're projecting
[1:29:43] nation is stronger than the devil he can
[1:29:46] attain your predestination from you God
[1:29:50] himself and he doesn't have power
[1:29:53] he doesn't have power to reach every

[1:30:23] dwells in eternity that's where all the
[1:30:26] power is the power is in eternity and
[1:30:29] that was a devil is afraid of because
[1:30:32] one eternity trapped down here he is
[1:30:34] finished
[1:30:35] Hara let them fire Paul we are in a 18
[1:30:40] holy convocation we are in a new king I
[1:30:45] don't know what's going to happen I
[1:30:47] don't know what's going to take place
[1:30:48] but I believe young people are going to
[1:30:51] be baptized another Kingdom because if
[1:30:54] he ate me another day of Pentecost and
[1:30:57] the church famous
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:25] we're receiving the julienne to your joy
[1:31:31] it's not from the natural your joy could
[1:31:35] never be satisfied because your appetite
[1:31:38] has already been introduced to aid their
[1:31:41] joy your appetite has already been
[1:31:45] introduced that the victory of the
[1:31:48] entity your appetite you have already
[1:31:51] been introduced to success from the SD
[1:31:54] so nothing that will have to offer you
[1:31:56] could I can show you anymore that's why
[1:31:58] when you're not insured you feel
[1:32:00] miserable you know your humors rural
[1:32:01] when you're not in the presence of God
[1:32:03] because your appetite has already been
[1:32:05] introduced to some energy is so good you
[1:32:08] can try them on the substitute but it
[1:32:10] never is as good as a boot on the ATP it
[1:32:13] can never taste as good from the RAM of
[1:32:16] eternity if I cap your destination its
[1:32:19] eternal life you are not supposed to
[1:32:21] tire you are supposed to have eternal
[1:32:23] life but you are not supposed to be sick
[1:32:26] you are supposed to walk over signature
[1:32:28] and in this easy
[1:32:30] we will walk over tired we will walk
[1:32:32] over handsome
[1:32:34] we will walk over female transition
[1:32:36] because he cannot exist in the SBS and
[1:32:39] the idiot only creatures that have no
[1:32:42] beginning could be there and fixes how
[1:32:45] to beginning that never had a beginning
[1:32:47] you're trying harder beginning your
[1:32:50] problem you know when your problem
[1:32:52] status in our beginning it must come to
[1:32:55] an end
[1:33:01] and the 50 men hallelujah somebody give
[1:33:06] us how to pray hallelujah
[1:33:12] oh my you may be seated
[1:33:16] I love that you know when your problems
[1:33:17] done you know when the pins happen in
[1:33:21] your body once you can identify just a
[1:33:24] point it means as an enemy because when
[1:33:27] a parent has no salvation there was no
[1:33:29] beginning to it he was always he he was
[1:33:32] already to know if you can identify the
[1:33:36] starting point it's coming to an end I
[1:33:38] can't identify my stopping point because
[1:33:42] I always was always was part of God and
[1:33:45] there's no devil to take my name out
[1:33:48] there's no demon had take me out of
[1:33:50] God's thoughts when he was there all by
[1:33:53] himself before there was a moon before
[1:33:56] there was not fast he was thinking about
[1:33:58] me he was thinking about you
[1:34:00] you maybe pieces humility for a minute
[1:34:04] what mistakes that had a beginning cut
[1:34:07] copy eternal plan of thought for your
[1:34:09] life what could you have ever done that
[1:34:12] had a beginning when you began
[1:34:14] fornicating that to never stop the
[1:34:17] eternal kind of God for your life
[1:34:19] because in and one occasion had a
[1:34:22] beginning it was of an ending because of
[1:34:25] power the eternal power of God to
[1:34:29] destroy everything
[1:34:31] suhara beginnings everything that can be
[1:34:34] shaken will be shaken and only what
[1:34:37] eternal will remain
[1:34:42] maybe seated hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:34:50] hallelujah
[1:34:52] maybe see the higher law is thing the
[1:35:04] higher law of eating is the proved there
[1:35:08] is a higher law when they nailed Jesus
[1:35:10] to the cross they all thought you were
[1:35:12] dead even the devil himself understand
[1:35:15] this even the devil with all of his
[1:35:17] years of experience thought Jesus was
[1:35:20] finished and Jesus when he rose from the
[1:35:25] dead he introduced a new law that
[1:35:27] confused even the devil because while
[1:35:30] the travel is having a celebration
[1:35:31] there's a knock on the door the giver
[1:35:34] wait a minute we invited all the VVIP to
[1:35:37] celebrate Jesus Moses was trouble
[1:35:40] Ibrahim was trouble Elijah was trouble
[1:35:43] but this Jesus was railroaders so when
[1:35:46] we cut leaders on the cross he the devil
[1:35:48] torture can celebrate but while the
[1:35:50] devil is celebrated there was a knock on
[1:35:52] the door
[1:35:54] this knot was not supposed to happen
[1:35:57] because under the law of the 17 when you
[1:36:00] were dead you're supposed to be dead
[1:36:01] but Jesus was not funded 17
[1:36:08] so you look at me now with a Joey and
[1:36:11] I'm 16 elements but I'm not on the 17
[1:36:14] I'm not from Trinidad
[1:36:15] I'm not from this world I'm an alien I'm
[1:36:18] not from this world
[1:36:20] I come from God I don't know in fact of
[1:36:23] course you may be seated
[1:36:27] so Jesus he walked and open the door the
[1:36:31] devil is like who is this
[1:36:33] and here comes Jesus he does need to ask
[1:36:35] permission because the higher law the
[1:36:37] idiot never needs to ask permission well
[1:36:45] if the idiot just power when you speak
[1:36:48] it has happened so trust was in the
[1:36:50] battle just within even understand what
[1:36:53] was going on but we called you within
[1:36:55] his emphasis the Prophet said he was
[1:36:57] able to connect to DSD how many needed
[1:37:00] more life you can see some standstill
[1:37:02] and trust we didn't even understand the
[1:37:05] mechanics that is not the Sun less
[1:37:07] movement is the earth that's moving but
[1:37:10] God has a translatory angels if they're
[1:37:12] sometimes they'll stop the earth move
[1:37:14] this part put things in place
[1:37:16] it isn't matter what has to happen what
[1:37:19] about oh really
[1:37:21] anything I needed something
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] so out of here we're chillin alright now
[1:37:29] when you recreate this as they sort of
[1:37:32] come back home
[1:37:34] God will move mountains he will move
[1:37:37] subways he will move planes but he was
[1:37:40] also like that to bring that back to the
[1:37:43] house of God
[1:37:52] huge pivot I told you I'm a spare tire
[1:37:56] I'm definitely encourage you tonight you
[1:37:57] may be seated but I pray this encourages
[1:38:00] somebody tonight to know that you have
[1:38:02] more power you have acceptable power and
[1:38:05] they never want you to realize that ever
[1:38:07] wanted is be acquired and be a normal
[1:38:09] church member but it is not about church
[1:38:12] is about you accessing who you really
[1:38:14] are when you recognize me from wait a
[1:38:17] minute I always want I always will see
[1:38:21] because I'm a part of course and once a
[1:38:23] holy Lopez isn't kind of my soul it's
[1:38:26] all over me it's keeping me alive and
[1:38:33] the whole ego is what connects you to
[1:38:35] your destination can the church amen
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:49] so under the law of seven days the Lord
[1:38:54] tells because you fell in sin you
[1:38:56] finished because you make a mistake
[1:38:59] write them off ZOA limits with his
[1:39:06] higher law oh you may be seated
[1:39:12] there was a woman when Jesus was a year
[1:39:18] it was not a report that was me it was
[1:39:22] not here see there was some believers
[1:39:25] who caught her in the very act of
[1:39:28] adultery and what do we heard about it
[1:39:32] he was caught in the very act and they
[1:39:37] brought her to Jesus because they were
[1:39:41] thinking
[1:39:43] under the laws of the 70s but when Jesus
[1:39:50] looked at the situation Jesus knowing
[1:39:54] that there's another law he didn't
[1:39:57] respond to their demand their judgments
[1:39:59] he just asked him a question you without
[1:40:02] sin cast the first tool no problem if
[1:40:07] you want to go by the law of the 70s
[1:40:08] stone no problem yes but wait up you
[1:40:11] with nothing Houston and Jesus do not
[1:40:16] embarrass them he turned it back so that
[1:40:19] they could look at themselves it was no
[1:40:21] longer teeth looking at them but they
[1:40:23] had to look inside and one by one they
[1:40:27] have to recognize you know what I forgot
[1:40:29] I have to go to the grocery I actually
[1:40:34] forgot my kids in school and one by one
[1:40:38] day to go away
[1:40:39] and Jesus looked at the woman no
[1:40:43] disarray gets powerful he's a woman
[1:40:45] whereas I accusers how is he look there
[1:40:49] was nobody and Jesus no against the law
[1:40:53] 7 days would require her to be stoned
[1:40:56] said neither do I
[1:41:01] he's speaking neither can I
[1:41:04] who come from God condemned me he
[1:41:10] continues a higher you may be seated
[1:41:14] - when the doctor says tonight there is
[1:41:17] no hope your kids is terminal we don't
[1:41:22] know what to do for you we don't know
[1:41:24] how to work the situation out we never
[1:41:26] saw this situation before that's the law
[1:41:29] of the 17 speakers there is a higher law
[1:41:32] from the easy thing that can heal any
[1:41:36] sickness not to perform any surgery when
[1:41:40] the family things that you can never
[1:41:42] change and they don't understand you
[1:41:44] there is a higher law let people think
[1:41:46] you're gonna give up when your marriage
[1:41:48] he's like it's about to collapse there's
[1:41:51] a higher law when you can't pay your
[1:41:53] bills there's a higher law you may be
[1:41:56] seated
[1:41:57] Jesus was not only interested in their
[1:42:00] spiritual needs but when he needed money
[1:42:02] to pay packages he go fish
[1:42:04] they got Buddha when they cut the fish
[1:42:06] there was money to pay the bill because
[1:42:08] he was interested in their deity living
[1:42:10] and their life because they want a
[1:42:13] destination when he would need nothing
[1:42:16] you didn't hear what I said he was on a
[1:42:20] definition onto it and when he was need
[1:42:23] nothing but he was getting used to them
[1:42:26] getting provided for all of you means
[1:42:28] not what they wanted but for all of
[1:42:31] their needs that's what God does he
[1:42:34] wants to beat every need
[1:42:35] and it doesn't mean in your heart
[1:42:37] tonight he is able to meet whatever that
[1:42:40] means
[1:42:41] if you need healing he's able to meet
[1:42:43] that fear you need a holding off he's
[1:42:46] able to meet that end you need to be
[1:42:48] restored he's able to meet that need
[1:42:51] you are back light again tonight he is
[1:42:53] able to bring you back and the church
[1:42:56] came Oh hallelujah
[1:43:01] friends we are coming to the end of time
[1:43:03] now in the message you may be seated
[1:43:06] future home of the heavenly bridegroom I
[1:43:08] do think bright but there are not many
[1:43:09] visions 110 and we read it it's called
[1:43:12] not a dispensation not a 70 it's called
[1:43:14] the fullness of time and when the
[1:43:16] fullness of time has come that's when
[1:43:18] time has been fulfilled when there's no
[1:43:21] more time then you go into eternity
[1:43:23] after the seven church age is over and
[1:43:26] by the man's head and it is Luther's age
[1:43:29] is over Methodist age is over
[1:43:31] Pentecostal ages over now you go into
[1:43:34] what eternity no more sevens no more
[1:43:36] trees no more other there in eternity
[1:43:38] where there's no such thing that numbers
[1:43:40] and times and things all my you see it
[1:43:43] now so that's my hope friends and that's
[1:43:46] the same thing when the balance says he
[1:43:48] does when he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:43:51] baptism with higher he can come and
[1:43:54] dwell with you and we can sit and have
[1:43:57] any places in Christ Jesus because we
[1:43:59] are already in him not we will be we are
[1:44:01] now sitting in Christ Jesus
[1:44:03] how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost
[1:44:06] baptism by one spirit we all baptized
[1:44:09] into Christ and that's not a proper
[1:44:12] message question answers before there
[1:44:14] was a word I love this good you were in
[1:44:17] God's thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost that settles everyday people every
[1:44:25] day before there was the world you were
[1:44:28] in God's thought let's give you the Holy
[1:44:31] Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting
[1:44:34] it
[1:44:35] and he shows you himself because you
[1:44:38] desired he shows you in Christ before
[1:44:40] you or Jesus any of you was on the earth
[1:44:44] and he sent Jesus listen listen to the
[1:44:47] purpose to die to prepare the way to
[1:44:49] send the Holy Ghost to bring you so the
[1:44:53] holy go have to bring you himself
[1:44:58] cavitus came at all he said this is a
[1:45:01] church so I'm at home now sees or that
[1:45:03] is so rich to me to think it's not what
[1:45:06] I wanted it wasn't my desire
[1:45:09] it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing
[1:45:12] I have not one thing to do with it but
[1:45:15] before the world ever started God for us
[1:45:18] and put our name on the lamb book of
[1:45:20] life before they ever was a world talk
[1:45:22] about God so friends the purpose of the
[1:45:25] endtime message the war purpose was to
[1:45:28] lose the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost must
[1:45:33] burn in the river you think it's almost
[1:45:34] 2000 years but praise the Son of Man be
[1:45:38] Lynn the prophet lose the Holy Ghost
[1:45:40] lose your inheritance lose your promise
[1:45:44] but God didn't want the Holy Ghost to
[1:45:46] fall on your flesh from your ideas on
[1:45:49] your emotions on your pride because we
[1:45:52] just be Pentecostal so for all these
[1:45:55] years the Holy Ghost was these guys as
[1:45:58] the word and service after service the
[1:46:02] responsibility of ministers was to make
[1:46:04] sure that the full word representing the
[1:46:07] mechanics was in you that's why the
[1:46:10] public is in a secret is the word is in
[1:46:12] the bride not the word is in the message
[1:46:15] ditches but the word is in the brain so
[1:46:19] how do you know who the bride is she can
[1:46:21] see the full word giggity correction you
[1:46:25] can take repute we could take
[1:46:27] encouragement but I think the night the
[1:46:30] bridal hell the word feed long enough
[1:46:32] this is this a time for the rushing my
[1:46:36] QE and so in these videos to claim their
[1:46:39] inheritance you made me feel it for a
[1:46:41] minute I'm not going to be too much
[1:46:42] longer with you if I want to strike
[1:46:43] something know there are times when it's
[1:46:48] got to be a group
[1:46:53] there are times you need to be a group
[1:46:55] and individual couldn't a caracal it
[1:47:02] took the whole army to go th Jericho are
[1:47:08] you with me
[1:47:08] there is a season to be identified and
[1:47:12] be a group I want to read a couple coats
[1:47:21] that are makers but the balance said in
[1:47:23] what was a holy was given for the same
[1:47:24] Holy Spirit that sees the Lutheran's
[1:47:27] that sanctify the Methodist that
[1:47:29] baptized the Pentecostal is now setting
[1:47:32] in order the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:34] and then why am i against organized
[1:47:37] religion but the relative the
[1:47:38] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:47:40] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:47:44] the word notice is all still group
[1:47:49] dependent one live here we are the end
[1:47:51] time coming from the east or west or
[1:47:53] north or south what are we doing getting
[1:47:56] ready for that rapture
[1:47:57] getting ready rolling ourselves steady
[1:47:59] for few minutes till every fiber is
[1:48:03] filled with the Holy Ghost but by 1965
[1:48:10] in the message of paradox but
[1:48:13] appearances and so has the church world
[1:48:15] in this lastly it's come along it's
[1:48:18] pretty spot but it's coming a time
[1:48:21] where's mercy
[1:48:22] it's must do it you have got to come and
[1:48:25] II visions also of this journey yet as
[1:48:28] there was of other journeys they has
[1:48:30] come you have to come and Ephesians and
[1:48:32] episodes and Ephesians of this journey
[1:48:34] now for the brand important that
[1:48:36] Ephesians parallels just work so when we
[1:48:39] read Ephesians rereading Joshua when you
[1:48:41] read us what we read in Ephesians not
[1:48:44] only that listen carefully but the book
[1:48:47] of Ephesians is the book of trust one of
[1:48:50] the New Testament it's dividing and
[1:48:52] setting in order people become one so in
[1:48:56] this day and this is God is not placing
[1:48:58] any Church any group
[1:49:01] it's individuals who would possess their
[1:49:03] individual in Harrison everybody with me
[1:49:07] now let me skip here we know this but
[1:49:10] here try something but the Branham says
[1:49:13] he had a gumption how book senators with
[1:49:15] their labor pains and stuff like that
[1:49:16] but I want to come to a point here
[1:49:21] hallelujah quite a bit here designing of
[1:49:37] the inheritance so it was after forty
[1:49:40] years in the wilderness remember to turn
[1:49:42] him is over in the Willis for 40 years
[1:49:44] and the Babbitt better for five years
[1:49:47] before together so after it's so cool
[1:49:51] over for forty years there was five
[1:49:53] years where it went Jericho a I took
[1:49:57] this place they did this place and five
[1:49:59] years now just what city in verse one
[1:50:04] I'm not worried too much longer there's
[1:50:06] no trust was all and stricken in years
[1:50:08] and the Lord said unto him though on all
[1:50:12] and sibelius know when cause does that
[1:50:14] to you the Bible is something else now
[1:50:22] Georgia was always getting and the loss
[1:50:24] that I am throw at all and sickening is
[1:50:27] what a word rest of the Lord and then
[1:50:33] I'm very minute yes very much land to be
[1:50:36] present so even though trust with all
[1:50:38] and is very an entire and God is
[1:50:40] speaking to him without even seeing it
[1:50:42] enough in a way that we might think we
[1:50:44] have to say to make you feel not bad if
[1:50:46] you all you shouldn't use for your land
[1:50:48] to be taken this is the land that yet
[1:50:52] remain it all the borders of the
[1:50:54] Palestine and all the story from C Hall
[1:50:57] which is before Egypt even under the
[1:51:00] borders of Ephraim northward which is
[1:51:03] coated in a Gilliland my love of the
[1:51:06] Philistine the Gaza type and the after
[1:51:09] type and the s permanent the p-type and
[1:51:12] the April night
[1:51:13] also the a life and God is not done plus
[1:51:18] will you hold you're picking a name but
[1:51:21] I want you to remember yes still more
[1:51:23] than an inheritance ahead are you may be
[1:51:28] seated and it goes on from the salt all
[1:51:32] the land of the canaanites not some of
[1:51:34] the land of the Canaanites but all the
[1:51:36] land of the enemy and Mara that is
[1:51:38] beside of Midianite also affected of
[1:51:41] borders of the other right and I'm not
[1:51:44] done yet
[1:51:44] and the land of the give lights and all
[1:51:46] Lebanon - what a Sun rising so when you
[1:51:51] see the horizon Joshua
[1:51:53] even so you all on a Sat land is your
[1:51:56] land
[1:52:01] community from loud-ass unnumbered
[1:52:07] German on to the entering of hammers all
[1:52:10] inhabitants of the hill country from
[1:52:12] Lebanon unsymmetrical name and all
[1:52:16] opinion then will I Drive out before the
[1:52:20] turn of Israel and sit is the
[1:52:24] instruction only divides out by lot on
[1:52:28] to the Israelites one inheritance as I
[1:52:30] have commanded me could you think
[1:52:36] someone you may be seated if you could
[1:52:40] take the morning we can go on and on
[1:52:41] long you may be see that everybody knows
[1:52:44] the normal along with you but this word
[1:52:47] is even good right now so that's just
[1:52:49] what that means
[1:52:50] so just what sample for teen the
[1:52:53] dividing of the inheritance begins and
[1:52:56] this away was a go to church tribe by
[1:53:00] tribe they are coming to claim their
[1:53:03] inheritance this is what I've been
[1:53:07] waiting for this is what is what about
[1:53:10] when you we need under the whip of the
[1:53:13] taskmaster can you that there's a
[1:53:16] profitable land somewhere when you walk
[1:53:19] on the Egypt is what is Sanders holds
[1:53:21] about when Miriam play the tambourine
[1:53:26] you may reveal it has not been easy
[1:53:30] because when they walked out of Egypt
[1:53:33] and they thought it would be in the land
[1:53:35] underneath 40 years distant that should
[1:53:42] have been maybe a month
[1:53:43] 40 years this circle and dial or one by
[1:53:47] one except for Joshua and here it has
[1:53:51] not been easy but that generation that
[1:53:55] has been born in the wilderness all the
[1:53:58] I heard about was this promise man while
[1:54:01] in the woman is the promised land is the
[1:54:03] head when they were marching around
[1:54:05] jericho departmental anderson in the
[1:54:07] battle of the eye of summit land is
[1:54:09] ahead and after forty and five years is
[1:54:12] being divided no the tribe of Reuben
[1:54:16] comes forward and I can see Joshua these
[1:54:19] old you repeated he's stricken in age
[1:54:22] but you seen that's your land and the
[1:54:25] whole tribe of Reuben they rejoice
[1:54:28] because it's been a long journey but I
[1:54:30] go King what it is women and the tribe
[1:54:34] of Reuben they have their panels they
[1:54:36] help you have eyes and I see we have all
[1:54:38] and then from the tribe of Simeon then
[1:54:42] the tribe of Levi and one by one
[1:54:44] Levi didn't get a land and hurt them
[1:54:46] because they're the Levites and then and
[1:54:47] they come to type of Judah warrior tribe
[1:54:52] wrong warrior
[1:54:54] the Royal tries to try committed kings
[1:54:58] of Israel came from keep everything for
[1:55:00] a minute are you with me tonight I was a
[1:55:03] depicted a young strong confident men of
[1:55:06] Judah and their wives and their children
[1:55:08] as they feel the strength he may be
[1:55:14] seated not only with a tribal should
[1:55:16] have been known for his king but this
[1:55:18] thrive had one unique distinction from
[1:55:20] every other tribe there was one man
[1:55:23] among them that was just different and I
[1:55:27] can imagine that the tribe of Judah is
[1:55:29] waiting to get their portion there's a
[1:55:32] stillness in the camp and it's a shuffle
[1:55:35] that's going on and it's a lone man he's
[1:55:38] walking walking in front and you can see
[1:55:41] the smiles of the soldiers at the watch
[1:55:43] in respect at this man walk to the front
[1:55:46] of the tribe of Judah and he interrupts
[1:55:50] the proceedings
[1:55:51] he is the rubs what had been handed
[1:55:54] tribe I tried he interrupts would be
[1:55:57] inhabited a group and his death listen
[1:56:00] yeah just one come on but those of you
[1:56:04] who don't know my name is Kira I was
[1:56:07] dead
[1:56:09] when we met when we went into the land I
[1:56:14] was next
[1:56:15] I'm the only one panic occasionally
[1:56:19] don't breathe so good
[1:56:22] I supported by the end I can't get them
[1:56:24] out of my head that was put the honey
[1:56:28] was good
[1:56:29] Moses promise me now therefore give me
[1:56:39] my Mountain
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:41] you may repeat it for a minute
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:50] no mrs. Hill empathy be I'm not speaking
[1:56:54] for the tribe of Judah I'm speaking for
[1:56:57] myself this was a promise multi-tier to
[1:57:00] me and the church somewhere if you're
[1:57:11] gonna celebrate
[1:57:15] you may repeat it for a minute Caleb had
[1:57:20] a revelation now know the challenge in
[1:57:27] the message a lot of people don't know
[1:57:29] the Bible so because they don't on a
[1:57:33] Bible because the Prophet was the shine
[1:57:36] light on the written word so they're
[1:57:40] people who take the prophets message and
[1:57:42] don't even read the scripture but you
[1:57:44] know how the Bible describes Elam the
[1:57:48] method called Caleb Caleb the son of
[1:57:50] Jephunneh the Canaanite
[1:57:52] we're in the Caleb of the tribe of Judah
[1:58:00] and hold somewhere so some theologians
[1:58:04] argue is that's Philip there are two
[1:58:08] possibilities on the one hand they argue
[1:58:12] he could be a Gentile or the best-case
[1:58:15] scenario he could be a cousin because in
[1:58:19] Genesis 1519 the Covenant that God made
[1:58:22] with Abraham includes the land of the
[1:58:25] Canaanites so in Genesis 15:18 of
[1:58:28] evident in the theme there the Lord made
[1:58:30] a covenant with Abraham saying on that I
[1:58:33] feel have I given this land on the river
[1:58:35] of Egypt unto the great river the river
[1:58:36] Euphrates the tonight and the Canaanites
[1:58:39] and the cabinet and the hittite and the
[1:58:41] perizzite so he never is of the kiloton
[1:58:47] so Caleb was not a Judah by natural
[1:58:51] birth somewhere along the journey
[1:58:55] Caleb join the rugs not only join the
[1:58:59] ranks but I wasn't understanding he was
[1:59:00] one of the twelve that went into the
[1:59:02] Promised Land
[1:59:03] so not only turn around but he was such
[1:59:06] a soldier and he rules to the top of the
[1:59:09] ranks to represent a tribe of Judah
[1:59:14] how does a man who is that born of the
[1:59:18] tribe represent attract under the laws
[1:59:22] of the tribes of Israel you have to be
[1:59:24] adopted into the track correctly then to
[1:59:28] try to admit that Caleb had to have a
[1:59:31] character worried that the tribe of
[1:59:33] Judah count him worthy to represent
[1:59:37] aside when he was born of the tribe so
[1:59:43] when they never looked at me and say you
[1:59:45] don't look like Judah you don't look
[1:59:47] like a Christian but I can go on now you
[1:59:50] just wake me up and put me into the
[1:59:52] tribe of the family of God because I
[1:59:55] wasn't worthy to begin with but if you
[1:59:57] can make it I can make it to somebody
[2:00:00] give God a total frame
[2:00:08] do everything for a minute is this tango
[2:00:15] a little more yes how much I'm driving
[2:00:19] home on the individual part of the sea
[2:00:22] it moved from the tribal the group the
[2:00:26] easel is in this church it with this
[2:00:27] group it witness to other people and
[2:00:29] scared of us I don't want to hear that
[2:00:31] tell me where my motor Ruben give me on
[2:00:35] to nodosa
[2:00:36] here the time afterwards tell me my
[2:00:39] mountain that Moses promised me and
[2:00:54] there's a lot of lessons we could take
[2:00:56] from this man korcula that we don't know
[2:00:58] much about but we know he made it can I
[2:01:01] just read from the Bible just for 14
[2:01:04] verse 6 then the children of Judah came
[2:01:07] unto Joshua and gilga and kill as the
[2:01:09] son of Jeff another killer night setting
[2:01:12] him told no answer thing this is not an
[2:01:14] extreme shoe you don't know it's a thing
[2:01:16] that the Lord said unto Moses the man of
[2:01:19] God concerning me and V imperious
[2:01:23] vanilla what he is always iron Moses the
[2:01:27] servant of the Lord can leave from

[2:01:56] be out of his mountain for 45 years

[2:02:38] the better but we are here again another
[2:02:42] holy time of comes and we are planning
[2:02:45] on the best of the greatest management

[2:05:25] that kayla was speaking about with my

[2:05:28] I believe was more than that it was a
[2:05:30] strength of character

[2:06:08] the musician can get ready so friends we
[2:06:11] are bringing it to put them in your
[2:06:13] individual inheritance and we have been
[2:06:17] living by the evidence of the new land
[2:06:20] it's a good land at the land of toys
[2:06:23] it's a land of grades it's a land of
[2:06:26] possibility to land of restoration is a
[2:06:29] land of of redemption and any man and
[2:06:31] this is a paradox that believes God and
[2:06:33] pick them at his word no matter what the
[2:06:35] situation is God will perform another
[2:06:37] paradox isn't it so what about our
[2:06:41] things we have a mountain to possess yes
[2:06:45] among them come see it all the way to
[2:06:47] charity
[2:06:49] that's touchy of a perfect man that
[2:06:51] that's our mountain people don't want to
[2:06:54] talk about that much anymore because the
[2:06:56] goal that mountain you have to pass
[2:06:58] brotherly kindness and that's the part
[2:07:02] of the mountain people when they read it
[2:07:08] but in the Memphis public praying by
[2:07:10] putting weakness but around said all
[2:07:12] God's strategies to take human vessels
[2:07:14] and shake the world with them like a
[2:07:16] tentacle that is the a Pentacles what
[2:07:19] did he do it taken them 10 days to get
[2:07:21] all emptied up but they were all
[2:07:23] standing there with their vessels to
[2:07:25] enough time God became someone fill them
[2:07:27] up it shook the world poured himself
[2:07:29] into them that's the need of today
[2:07:31] that's what we need today is empty
[2:07:34] vessels yes sir so God can fill them up
[2:07:37] God kind of use them as they're already
[2:07:40] filled up if you're full of theological
[2:07:43] training God can use you God got to have
[2:07:47] empty vessels so you can fill them in
[2:07:50] the mantle speaking of mountain the
[2:07:52] problem that I believe that the Church
[2:07:54] of the Living God is moving into there
[2:07:55] now that's going to shake the whole
[2:07:57] world that the first time is built in
[2:08:00] the days of Jesus of Nazareth with a
