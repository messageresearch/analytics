I am so grateful to God that I was there to witness for myself the glory of Almighty God that shown on my daughter's face as they wheeled her into the ward he was amazed and everyone that visited her saw it and exclaim as I did it stayed with her for days even the doctors and nurses saw it every person that came into contact with her knew it it was the grace of God Felicia was up and the very next day after surgery was walking and shattered so much so that the nurse that was helping her had to remind Felicia that it was just a couple of hours ago she had a major surgery and that she needed to take it easy as Felicia had gone ahead of the nurse who stopped and look at her in amazement I told my daughter long before the surgery that this time around the doctors would know that the success of a surgery was more than just man that it was Almighty God himself the morning of a post operation when all the surgeon doctors and interns came to her bedside a surgeon told her they were means at how well the surgery went and how easy it was to perform that it blew their minds those doctors know it wasn't them alone they may not choose to admit it but they know that a greater power was in the room the head surgeon commended Felicia for being such a good patient he went further to tanker in front of the doctors for tank in front of them of the doctors for tanking he turned and told the doctors

he said oxys the Lord reign in the time of Lateran so the Lord shall make bright clothes and give them the showers of rain to everyone in the field or bless you you may be seated oh praise the Lord so before you hear the word this morning and but Isaac went to present to you the gospel of the kingdom amen something like to share with you before he comes on I guess all of you who might know but a Billy Billy Graham died twenty first of all that's Wednesday the age of ninety nine years old he was born this 7th of November 1918 and you know what about a random said about him or robots as to angels that was sent on to Sodom and he was the third of course that stayed with the elect on the backs of the desert he identified Greyhound GRE GM six letters but we know that brother Branham his name of seven letters and these two angels were sent to Sarang and that interest sent to Saddam was the voice of warning the voice of judgment and I believe that Billy Graham is a sign of ACLU's in era hero of God's servants and messengers and Christ to the world we know Billy Graham he was presented not just justification but repentance in a big way no robots were the Pentecostals and go to come off the scene and now we're Graham is off the scene also and but a Branham is also off the scene so what's next well judgment is next what's next the sixth seal is next judgment a lot of things that we you know figure we can't overcome and this and that all that will soon change because what's about a hit is gonna be worldwide it's not just this country and that country you're going to be worldwide judgment going to be can distract the earth but I call it the beginning of Sorrows you're not talking about tribulation you just over at the beginning of Sorrows rumors of wars discipline that happening men hot feeling for fear for the things that accompany earth so it's gonna be a shaken time a rocking time we have children we have grandchildren we have loved ones but we have to understand that we are right on the direct prophecy it's not just garden together as a church to have good church service go send a messenger to reveal the whole secret of God for eruption of the church and there's a promise of latter rain that has yet to come I'm not talking about service an atmosphere I'm talk about a tureen the or drawing of the spirit that make manifest what God has promised I didn't promise a loitering God that's it God promised a Lazzarini he's going to send it are you looking for it it's going to come because the rain when the manifest every seed falls could evil wicked every seed the rain gonna bring for every scene and everything will produce after this kind but it's a perfect man seed there are faith in it virtue in it not that will bring forward after its kind there's gonna be perfect sons walking on this earth I don't care what your senses tell you right now this is a prophecy that can feel that can fall or glory to God amen hallelujah so when these three angels came down in Boca Genesis one came to Abraham and revealed secrets to Abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do seeing that chocolate was next and we believe law hats I miss all his judgment I wish all his black out there's a grease and there's a power to be released to a bride amen such I'm gonna read a few things before but Isaac comes but a Branham in Patmos vision he was talking about Daniel saw him hundred years he was the Ancient of Days one like the son of man coming in power and he had this here white as world and we find out that that cloud that came down he's not February 1963 Oh what former white cloud a white will quick that means the judge is already on the earth so brother Branham is not here believe Graham is not here or a bus is not here but he angels on the earth he said the angel is on the earth fixing things are wrong for the common of the Lord he's gonna take out this one move this one set up this government remove this president shift this Prime Minister here he was going to do whatever has to be done before the coming of the Lord and he will do everything that has to be done for you because all things work together for good to them that love God brings go through your life and no mistake your life has done by chance there's a divine purpose behind everything along your life you are not here this morning by chance this service is not by chance but I Isaac is not preaching this morning my chance or glory to God the holy course gonna be here the Holy Ghost is already here I'm you gonna speak this morning Oh glory to God hallelujah glory look what we are looking for for all these years it's about to begin [Applause] you know what I said it's about to begin [Applause] Oh glory to God hallelujah but a brand I'm Daniel 7:9 the books are opened and the book of the sinner and another book was open who came at him the church from the rapture tens of thousands and thousands and thousands who is that the bride coming with him judgment was set the books was open another book was opened which was a sleeping virgin and every man was judged out of the book oh my every man every man sent us same backside every man will be judged from that book no he said you know you better acts and give reason why it didn't and what you then you better know no you know better you might not have known it before but you do now where is this righteous be scarcely be saved where will the sinner and godly person appear the one who rejects knowing better and then we checks it is here was writers world his faith was like a burden of a burden of furnace and his voice like the song of many waters and then he interpreted what his many waters is he said the voice of many waters what does waters represent is it one a market down revelation 1715 the waters which those sources thickness on multitudes and people and tongues what a horrible thing is it for drifting soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the grid cataracts the fall why you think people as we want to repent and confess something on the deathbed because the soul began to travel and then know that they're leaving this world didn't know that everything is breaking up and I see all the intellect all the DCCC doctory CEO whenever somebody have all that begin to break up insider here and this

roar of the grid cataracts the Falls what a horrible thing it would be for that soul the voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment it's the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing near the voice of the multitude and thickness the voice of the seven stars in his hands to every church is preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming of divine judgment the voice of many waters came forth from one that looked like the Son of Man but what will it be - no you sit in the meetings unheard you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speaking out in a meeting that you set and you heard the judgment of God preached and refused it the great fall is just before you the great cataracts to your eternal doom the voice of many waters and I said your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded or you think about that one good not only a voice is recorded your ports are recorded God could play back your thoughts that's why I gotta hit hypocrisy Oh glory to God thinking one thing and seen another thing God prema your thoughts is recorded I always think about that not just your words but your thoughts [Applause] that's what we do wrong in a repent before it got taken I'm sure this year forgetfulness before anybody could even get it not even spoken fish it back out it came come back out on the discernment because God just take them and touches on push that sea of forgetfulness or glory that God already forgiven all a member jaysin hallelujah so bronzing he said to the Pharisees you hypocrites how can you speak good things and out of the abundance of the heart speak at the mouth calling me good master and you know I could look right to you and see you're a hypocrite you don't mean that or what will it be on that name when the voice thunders out of many waters many churches is forming out or you drift in soul you poor drifter drifting over that great cutter be careful it's a big horrible thing when you know there's no Steven for you then you can't get saved then you know your doom Lee is right before you when you know within a few minutes you'll get a voice it be part for me ye that work iniquity from everlasting into everlasting fire which is

damn message song it's not an intellectual message so we had a second club bucks bucks bucks no one no eternal fire but is the message song is a message song not even Raymond right miss a message song i encompassing message some you know a conversation that but the piece for me for my soul that inspire to feel the anointing when when saw a lot of demons and him David contain a message song you know

just right because that demon have to leave or get the Lord a show [Applause] my job almost done prophecy from souls in prison but Brannon there will be a ministry that will show great wonders Joelle said so but there will be no time for redemption it is all over the llamas don't took the book he's redeemed is over as Jesus first preached and was rejected and went and haunted those and preached them that were in prison that could not repent no time for salvation that same ministry will have to repeat again what if it could be the tipple to the eternal loss what if it is here why did that vision come when I was a kid why did I never think of it before he went on they never repented lost souls and I preached the words they get the Muybridge the wool said get there's no repentance the lamb took his book remember the seven seals ready to try to be open to succeed rather he hid the seventh seal let's continue and watch and continue some friends that is what's coming G first ministry what it was healing the sick Jesus ministry second part prophesy and that's the part that is tough because you puffy sign of what is to come but the Tillet ministry when the confirmation come the prophecies all over is fulfilled so Noah's ministry after the prophets have 120 years yeah come the rain either indigent of all peoples in a no seal I know gets a vision of it and I'll understand what you were saying all these years but the Lord shut the door and whatever DogWatch shut no man not even though I could open or whatever god door open no man could shut amen so I'll close with this a dream but but Anthony sent me this dream he said I am writing the fall injury I didn't know used to dream but Anthony never heard you said a dream before but dreaming a dream I know the Bible give young men dreams never hurt no Dundee dreaming you sure you didn't drink anything that night all right her I said no no so he dreamed the dream all right I'm right in the following dream I had this morning Saturday 24 February 2018 I dreamed I was in a sub urban housing area it was even in time Sun was just in his last light I remember being on the street and thinking how did I get here after this I saw people coming out of the houses and they were staring at the sky families came out of the houses with their children and they were all looking for something outside something's out some shouted saying did you see it here I didn't know what they were looking up at so I decided to look in the direction of the interest and I looked I saw full moon in the sky there all of a sudden a flash of lightning came down from the heavens pass through the moon I'm struck it'll be neat and after this I saw the moon immediately changed color from pale white to a fierce concern red it had an evil and eerie aura in the night sky the sky itself was red seemed to be on fire it was awful and scary night the families around me were in shock are the events that was taken place at this point you bet over seemed to appear next to me saying look at the moon it is the judgment to judgments of the Lord and then when I looked at the moon I looked closer and I noticed the craters of the moon began to shape itself into the image of a lion then you proceeded to say look and see it is the land it is God's Authority then as soon as this happened the earth began to wobble and convulse and people got scared then you point it over to the dissonance said things will begin to take place this believe me no more snows not sooner and you said that when the dreams room me to a city where I could see a tower beginning to crumble and fall people were horrified on their faces a mother grabbed her children and ran back inside their houses locking their doors everyone was screaming everyone was scared then you continue to see this place would be no more that fish would be no more there's another country that we cannot see now it has been utterly destroyed it was if you knew everything that was

from the Holy Scriptures and from the message of this how a law we thank you for your profit that Lord points us into the right direction this morning that law we can prepare ourselves for the rapture prepare ourselves for your pouring me you Lord open our understanding me you take me out of the way and speak to your people this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ may you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding in the name of Jesus and the church says Amen I like to greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ special welcome to brother Michael Mac Mayo god bless you the Macra to see you welcome home god bless you richly so without any hesitation can we go straight to the scripture we want to read from one portion of Scripture thank you musicians reading from second Peter one very familiar passage of Scripture and it's very difficult to see that you have a favorite scripture because all Scripture is given by God but for me personally this text speaks to me in a real special way and I really hold it close to my heart not just what is said but even the fact that God could use Peter to say it because Peter has a very interesting story so when he speaks is interesting how God could take a man who denied him and use him like this how God could take a man who fell and use him like this a man who backs lid and use him like this you know so second Peter one reading first one Simon Pizza a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious feet with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by visa might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound so is not just be in you but abound as in living dwell in Venis present but being manifested they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling this is the individual part make your calling and election sure for if he do these things shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ no this is pizza testifying from his heart wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things so I want you to really see Peter's burden here though he know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think it meets in other words he's saying here I think it's fit as long as I am in this Tabernacle in this body this physical appearance to stir you up by putting you into remembrance and that's what we are here to do this morning knowing that shortly I must put off this might Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ had showed me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto he do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hands knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost be the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning hallelujah are you happy to be in the house of the Lord he many many men I had the trials and testings good [Music] did you have enough trials and testings this week enough suffering this week because the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and we said last week the suffering that we go through a design for us for our character development is that right can the church say man so last week I'm trying to continue a bit from last week when we spoke on a new heart a new spirit his spirit and we took it from Ezekiel in the Old Testament but this morning I went to endeavor by the Holy goes to take it from the New Testament to quote what Peter said in verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so my title this morning is partakers of his divine nature and my subject by these exceeding great and precious promises and an inspiration a new heart a new spirit his spirit and the church saimin so just by way of introduction I'm not going to be too long with you today but in the message at Kadesh Barnea but the Menem says this is just but the Anthony says you just test the temperature what we need today is a good all-time st. Paul's revival and the Bible holy goes back into the church again education will never do it denomination will never do it they'll never be an organization ever substitute the Upper Room experience there will never be a school that will ever take the place of Pentecost it can't be but it's not by power not by might but by my spirit sail that's what we need today is back to the Bible experience Christians that are born-again that I washed in the blood of the Lamb mere white regenerated twice-born can the church say Amen so last week when we spoke of a new heart I'm gonna give you a new spirit I'm gonna give you I'm gonna put a new spirit in there it was really mapping from Ezekiel's voice the movement from your own self to a new individual a new creation it does mapping out a movement from your own nature to a different kind of nature can the church say man but pizza is speaking and he's encouraging people and you see we have got a lot of promises but by these exceeding greed precious promises these promises give us access to another nature it gives us access to partake of a divine nature can the church say man Oh hallelujah we're warming up this morning now everything has a nature when you talk about the nature of something you are referring to the inherent character or basic constitution of a person or thing so nature refers to character which could mean behavior it also refers to the constitution of something so water has a nature when you boil water it becomes steam that's the nature of water when you freeze water it becomes ice that's the nature of water the Prophet preached a message God being identified by his characteristics in other word God being identified by his nature God being identified by his behavior God being identified by his attributes God being identified by his elements God being identified by his composition so everything has a nature this puppet has a nature the ground I'm walking on has a nature a bird has a nature its nature is not to swim the nature of a bird is to fly a fish has a nature anybody with me this morning so let's dig a little deeper a thing is by nature it's essential characteristics a rock for example is composed of minerals it tends to be hard and brittle not bendable it is an object formed in or on the earth by processes not by human effort that is its nature so not only do inanimate objects have a nature but animate objects have a nature also in fact where the Branham says when God places men he gives even men apostles preachers a nature for the job at hand but now Peter is exhorting us that God has given us some promises and by these great promises we could become partakers not of our nature but partakers of the divine nature that was a Branham called his nature can the church amen so just as the moon has a nature and the Sun has a nature and the sea has a nature and salt has a nature and sugar has a nature and the car you drive is made up of elements that have their own nature so to God as a nature and his nature is called a divine in nature can the church amen and we as a people have a promise to be partakers to be partakers of that nature now merriam-webster defines Partick as to share so we're talking about sharing that nature to take part in to take part in that nature or experience something experience that nature along with others it goes on to have a portion so I can have a portion so when pizza is talking about partakers of that nature it means we get our own portion of that nature to possess or share a certain nature or attribute so Peter was speaking and he says I will do everything in my power to remind you while I'm in this flesh I want to encourage you that is a different nature that you are called for and forgot to get that nature to you he couldn't just do it anyhow he gave it to you in the form of promises because with all these promises without these bright promises without these word promises with all these seven thunder promises you can't touch that nature but because we have promises it gives us permission to partake in it or you know hear me this morning the promises give us permission to get a portion of the nature the promises give us permission to go after our children because the promise says the promise is unto you and to your children so because there's a promise the nature of God to go after your family you can partake in his divine nature and speak to your children has nothing to do with your condition it's based on his promise he's exceeding great and precious promises somebody please back to me somebody please back to me now you may be seated I had to do some research because exceeding great we don't write that way in English exceeding great was like same greatly great Peter ran out the woods he said exceeding great and precious so in case you wondering how could these things are you could be in your condition but because of this exceeding great and precious promises that's all you need for you to partake in the divine nature so hold on you may be seated the promises how could enough even when it's not manifested yet to take you into that nature you don't hear me this morning many of us we waited for manifestation and Peter seemed to leave and wait for the manifestation the promise is good enough it's an exceeding great promise it's a precious promise and that promise is good enough for you to worship good enough for you to shout [Applause] you may be seated you may be seated so Sampson he was a partaker of the divine nature because the nature of man by the Clarence is sinful the nature of man is fallen the nature of man is a lie the nature of man is to steal the nature of manage to do what he wants to do your nature is against God's nature so when Samson was able to lift up the gate that was blocking him that was not Samson nature Samson was able to reach into the divine nature and access a power that he did not have you don't hear me this morning and how did Samson excessive but the Branum said Samson connected to the prophecy or the promise that was given to Abraham that I seed shall possess the kids of the enemy so that exceeding great promise somewhere back in Genesis was good enough for Samson to become a partaker of the divine nature you don't hear me this Mona Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody give us our appraised Joshua was a partaker of the divine nature he was in the middle of a battle and he knew that he had the devil on the run like I believe this morning we have the devil on the run we started weeks ago every surface we given the devil a knockout punch every service and Joshua knew he had the devil on the run but also had a problem the Sun was going down but we had to reach beyond himself because he couldn't stop it but when he spoke to show you he's accessing the divine nature he said son stand still you may be seated I've said this before the show is divine nature he was connected to the Sun is not what moves is the earth rotates around the Sun he reached into the divine nature with his request because he was built on a promise that every place the sole of his foot said upon that is his land no man shall be able to stand before thee all the tears of my life as I was with Moses so I'm gonna be with you Joshua understood the promises for his game and the promises for his did give him access to partake of the divine nature please that Sun stand still and God said stop the earth God translated stop the earth just what didn't matter what needed to be stopped all he knew the devil was on the run and we got to finish the devil once we have him on the run [Applause] come to church amen [Applause] hallelujah everybody feelin fine everybody feelin fine we came to church to worship we came to get out of the humanistic realm and get out of our nature and get into his nature isn't that right whoo but the Branham was a partaker of the divine nature before the doctors hand touches my wife that wasn't his nature that was the nature of God where did that happen before when Jesus was here Centurion came to him and said listen my servant is sick I'm not even wood if you to come to my house but I'm a man and authority when I say to one go he goes when I tell him come he comes I recognize the authority that you have so if you could just speak to it that's enough for me and Jesus said could I wear a servant this healed that Centurion got home and didn't ask if he was healed he asked what time I want to see how fast it took because healing is not the issue I want to see how how how immediate the response was so don't consider it's strange when the Prophet says before the doctors hand touches my wife because that's a time element now he's tracking the progress of what the doctor is doing wherever the doctor is the tumor has to go down he connected to the divine nature of God can the church say man so you may be seated so can we talk about going a little bit [Applause] because I don't want to spend time talking about our nature because you know yourself but I want to focus on his nature because the promise is the partake of his nature is that right so I'm gonna use some scriptures in the book of numbers 23:19 the Bible said God is not man that he should lie that's his nature in John 4:24 says God is spirit that's his nature in Luke 24:39 Jesus said a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones that's his nature job in trying to describe the nature of God said in job 23 and verse 8 behold I go forward but he is not there I'm black what but I can't perceive him when he acts on the left I cannot behold him he chosen the right I cannot see him his nature is different than anything you've ever encountered in Isaiah describing is nature I see a sister whom when you liken me and make me equal and compare me that we should be alike I am God and there is no one like me we are talking about the nature of God is any buddy in the house this morning who wants to get caught up in the heavenlies [Applause] what we will discover as we go into the world it becomes already hard to define him it becomes very hard we can say water is h2o that's that's the nature that's the elements of it but what are the elements of God Exodus 3 and verse 13 and Moses said unto God behold when I come with to the chairman of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your father's had sent me unto you and they shall see to me what is his name what shall I see entered them I'm consonant to Moses I am that I am and he said thou shalt thou say the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you I am whatever you need I am whatever you want that is the nature of God Isaiah 43 and 10 before me there was no God for man there'll be none after me isaiah 44:6 that says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and there is no god beside me that's the nature of God Sam's not a tree to die strong this is David's attempt to describe the nature of God that drone is established from of all and Oh out from everlasting oh you could be from everlasting what type of nature is this anybody in the house this morning anybody's personal house this morning Sam's 90 verse 2 before the mountains were born or dog leaders give birth to the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God for a thousand years in thy sight like yesterday when it passes by all I saw watching the night sounds 102 but dole lured us abide forever and I mean to all generations of all doubted has found it and the heavens are the work of thy hand even D will perish were told us endure and all of them will wail like a comment like clothing dough will change them and they will be changed but though out the seam and the years will not come to an end that's the god I'm talking about that's the divine nature that I'm describing because we are being called from the humanistic into divine revelation into vision we are being called from mortality into immortality we are being called I want you to know what nature you're being called to first Timothy 1:7 now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory for ever and ever second Chronicles 206 who is able to build a house for him for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain him so Who am I that I should build a house for him acceptable incense before him thus saith the Lord and Isiah heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where then is a house you could build for me and where is a place that I may rest up for my hand made all these things does all these things came into being declares the Lord Jeremiah 23 is this okay with you this morning can we continue to talk about it you know where the prophets and when we talk about and he draws near he loves to Cathy he loves to get the praises he loves her get the adoration he loves when we describe him we sing that song lift Jesus higher lift him up for the world to see he said if I be lifted up draw minun to me that's the God we're talking about this morning still alpha still Omega but the Branham said his nature is his seven compound names his nature is your heart IRA his nature is jehova shamma his nature is the Havanese his nature is your horseshit to knew his nature is one holy spirit which he divided seven spirits of the true seven church ages seven colors through one time on that great white light that's who he is that's his nature that's his being that's his attributes and you are promised to be partakers of that divine nature he cannot get sick when you are partaker of his nature sickness can't harm you oh he said because I live you are gonna live also that divine nature makes you invincible makes you unstoppable makes it that you cannot be defeated you kind of lose a battle you kind of lose a war and that's your promise that's my promise partakers of his divine nature Jeremiah 23 23 am I your God who is near declares the Lord and not a court of owls can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him declares the Lord do I not fill the heavens and the earth declares the Lord Psalms 139 where can I go from thy spirit oh where can I flee from my presence if I ascend to heaven though out there if I make my parent shield and he'll be all now I hear if I take wings of the dawn and if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea even there my hand will lead me and I right hand will lay hold of me that's the nature of God he is bigger than your problems he is bigger than your situations he is bigger than the pain in your body he is bigger than your trials he is bigger than cancer he is bigger than tyre mateesah he is bigger than female problems he is bigger than that chapel that's trying to hold you back somebody give God a shout of praise [Applause] well Isaac you mean all of this that you were describing about Claude you mean I could get access to that didn't the Prophet teach us that all God was not part you know all that God was everything he ported to Christ and all that he putted the crisis quarter to the church has pointed to his peoples [Applause] the problem is we don't see who we are the problem is we don't know who we are but the Branham said the moment the bride gets to know who she is there'll be a national showdown there's no army could stop you there's no police can stop you there's no government could stop you there's no system could stop you because you are life of the Lamb you look like him you talk like him you have his name isn't power his authority that's who you are can the church say man I'd like to say I'm almost done talking about his nature but that's an impossibility to talk about his nature we'd never have to stop because he is from everlasting to everlasting there aren't enough words in the English language to describe him there aren't enough things we could do to give him glory because He is God all by himself he didn't have to save us what he did he didn't have to call us what he did because that's a nature of God the nature of God is to go after your fallen brother to go after the fallen sister to comfort him that morning to wipe the tears or open the blind eyes preach Liberty to the captives to sunny revival in your home that's the nature of God he can't help himself is just who he is it's just what he does is just his composition halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah go somebody help me preach this morning Jesus got there by the family later the week was going on they were having coffee and they were having Crick's they were sitting down a morning because Lazarus was dead and when Jesus cut Mary and Martha said to him if you had been here if you were come earlier our brother would not have died but the divine nature began to speak he said I am the resurrection and the life that's who I am that's how you can describe me that's my nature [Applause] and Jesus said roll away the stone roll away the stone I know you trying to cover up the messy situation you trying to cover up what happened you trying to cover up the problem we say roll away the stone I need access into the problem I need access into the failure I need access to the deadness in your life don't don't cover it up and and to us if it's all over it's not over until I say it's over I am the resurrection roll away the stone because I want to speak to your situation the nature of God is a speak and what he says is created so you might be dead on the inside roll away the stone this morning and hear the words of the Lord the Lord of God had spoken Luke and what prophesy the lion Harad somebody give God a shout of praise oh and this divine nature is our promise to be partakers we read the definition in it to have a portion of it what did Philip have Philip was a divine partaker so when he was in a convention and there was a Ethiopian eunuch who was reading the scripture trying to find who he was in God and God translated Philip to where that Ethiopian eunuch was so that he could get a word from the Lord or that's what I'm talking about he was connected to the nature of his Heavenly Father it will not be your strength it will not be your mind it will not be your power your nature is gonna change your your behavior it's gonna change your walk is gonna change your talk is gonna change your life is gonna change that's what the Holy Ghost has given for to change your nature to change your walk up to change your talk that's why the Holy Ghost is your promise [Applause] does anybody wanna change on in nature does anyone wanna change at your behavior Oh hallelujah that's why we have to preach the promises because the promises unlock see access into the divine nature without a promise and a promise is a commitment to act in a specific way at a specific time we may not know the time but the promise sir understands the time so Jesus breathe upon them and save you all lies send the promise of my father tarry in the city of Jerusalem until he knew the time he didn't know but it's a tarry because they had a promise and that promise had him in the Upper Room worship and that promise had him in the Upper Room separating themselves from the world that promise had him in the upper room separate from their family they were just with their spiritual family they were 120 it wasn't everybody there this was those who understood the promise and receive the promise the promise give them access into the divine nature because God is a spirit his nature express himself a spirit and you wanted a pour out the Holy Ghost but no Holy Ghost comes unless is a promise we to receive it and is a promise for him to give it but because we have a promise and the promises come to us as prophecy that's why the only order or the only class able to give us the promises is a prophetic order so when the Branham student our dear to speak a super Church a super race final voice final age that's promised and prophecy spoken by a star in the right hand of God an angel prophet and by these exceeding great and precious promises I might be tired but I got a promise he may be seated [Applause] sometimes it's hard to see it in the spiritual level because we live so much in the natural my god he builds it desi desi this is this if some wealthy family member you never met before said to you I promise you that by the end of this year I'll pay off your mortgage your car payment I'll pay everything for you how would that make you feel you know you're struggling every month with the payment your day your budgeting your fights Antonio and somebody says to you by the end of this year or thereabouts so it's not a specific around the end of the year I'm gonna pay off everything for you wouldn't your behavior said that she needs one time it makes you struggle difference enough because your budget in this month and your budget and every month at pass the budget such a effective less and less sooner because you know what this thing is they have a time limit and have a time limit anything and every month at pass is that a few later at that pay off yet - no but you're feeling lighter it that pay off yet but you're feeling better about yourself yeah you're looking in the mirror and your throne start to lift up a little bit because these struggles have like the stress you're you're stressed out but you have a promise when the bank warrior you say Inori I'll pay this month in Aurora don't worry when it bounces the quality before you're stressed out know you're less smiling telling us every day put before you have no idea come with a check by the Elysium pill you whole thing and I promise guess you're so excited now we don't know what dear you're healing is supposed to be but you have a promise of healing so you can rejoice no because your healing is coming you don't have the Holy Ghost yet but you can rejoice today because the promise has been made clear to you you may be seated and these are temporal promises what about a promise of the rapture I promise of eternal life you walking on your back coat and your foot hurt in your head didn't you this week I tell my wife you right side of my head is it not as many whole head is your right side these are things that are not to be things that have to be repeated see this is not to be that not supposed to happen I'm shows up to a minute over every headache - minun over every creeping thing crawling things right that's that's where we are going but I don't bother me here you have to enjoy it but it's a promise that we're gonna leave this place with a promise that we go to a place where there's no pain there's no sadness there's no sickness here's to depression there's no frustration there's no heart ache there's no identity crisis I wanted if I wanna make it I wonder if I'm gonna get it and there's no idea you bet you're gonna know you are sung you wanna know your daughter you wanna know you're gonna overcome you wanna know you're gonna make it can the church shame [Applause] hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah the divine nature of God Isaiah for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways so as he heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts when your nature you can only think a certain way but with his nature your thinking is different your own look is different now you can count the things that I'm not as doing the work because you are partaking of His divine nature Oh blessed be the name of the Lord now let's go back in Genesis a bit just kneeled on a few things you have time today because the nature of God is long-suffering the nature of God is patient the Miche of God as he loves he loves he loves worship he loves to get your undivided attention he said thou shalt have no other gods before me your job must be your God your house must be your God not even time as you go when we come to the house of God we come to put him for the second third fourth fifth put him everywhere in our lives he's let's go back to Genesis in the message oneness where the balance said that's God's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family his earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other I'm going to become all one isn't it a beautiful picture God and his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no hot eggs no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heart eat just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people can the church say man and therefore what they didn't follow just in line with God and golden and made them one so I'm gonna speed a few course it has put it in context in a message cause provider we have approached the fellowship he said I'd like to speak on that some night the super sign how he'd stretch his tent down here to dwell a human being so he's seen why Jesus scheme that we might know the nature of God when we see Jesus we see God in him see what God was and God's nature he manifested he displayed what God was to redeem man back to himself in the identified Christ of all Asia but the man said you see all these things just portrayed Christ he was a part of it God doesn't change his nature doesn't change his character doesn't change he has killed a word see and Malachi 3:6 proves that he just cheated his form for each age each age he has allotted part of word that which has been prophesied would happen in certain days well as that age comes along gorgeous moves in another form but the nature the characteristics is still the same I'm gonna balance and let it was God and Noah it was God in Moses it was God in Joshua it was God and Elijah it was God in Habakkuk he was Gordon Joelle it was God and Amos it was God in Isaiah it was Gordon Zakaria it was God in John it was all speaking about him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but all these men were partaking of the divine nature we preach this before that each of the men David was the attribute of Shepherd that God had in him because none of these men could have been all that God was so Elijah was the prophet that wasn't God Joshua was the portion he was back taking of the warrior aspect of God in his ministry but when Jesus came he was warrior he was Shepherd he was prophet he was Lord he was king he was or you don't hear me this morning when Jeremiah was speaking he was the mourner that's all he could have fulfilled but when Jesus came he was everything he was the divine nature can the church same from the message the revelation of Jesus Christ from church age books let me show you another reason why Satan hits this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows the devil knows do you know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever the devil knows this do you know this and he changes not so the devil knows that God cannot change he knows that a whole lot more and do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he's the same yesterday today forever then he is just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows assuredly that the original Church at Pentecost with the power of God st. mark 16 in action is the true church and that that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be can the church say man what are we saying realize I'm seeing as we bring it to his divine nature it brings a clarity to the fact that he's the same yesterday today and forever and in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom on the earthly bride but the Branham said it this way if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever ever saved the man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time and if he ever feel a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the same time and every other time on the same principle because he's the same yesterday the same today the same forever that's his nature that's his being that's his attributes so what's holding you back this morning from accessing that nature if you are put in the same way he is obligated to heal you he's obligated to fill you he's obligated to restore you can't somebody say man so we talked about the nature of God now let's talk a little bit about the changing of your nature the same way we spoke last week I'm not gonna be too long with you this morning just encourage you a bit from the message why it had to be Shepherd but if Adam said no you take a pig and you see it - this pig I'm going to make you a lamb and you wash him and you paint his toenails and so forth and give him food like a sheep give him some kind of a diet and put them out on the floor or out where the sheep herd in the alfalfa field or something and if there's a mud hole anywhere that hog will go just as straight to that mud hole as he can go see why is because his nature is still a hug what was what what what can a nature do you have this morning we are not here to try to wash you paint your toenails give you cheap food because if your nature isn't changed the first model you see coming out the Grammy on the valencian stretch you're gonna find yourself in that model [Applause] because your nature needs to change when you wash the pig the washing could take so long again you can lock him up in a room better Anthony and transport him on a truck down the highway and he will behave himself because he's locked in a cage and that's why some people love legalistic church because I locked in a cage but you're openly kids the nature is still a hog we are not trying to do hog Reformation hog like we have any hog mining business taeho we ain t need your transformation business your nature is rotten to begin with energy allows the mud [Applause] he may be seated that's why the preaching of the word is to identify your nature 1 and to point you to the change of nature we said in last week Peter walked with Jesus talked with Jesus he ate with Jesus when all the disciples were watching and the city man walking on the water Peters Lord of days you bid me come and Peter with only Holy Ghost stepped out and walked on water but his nature was still a hug because when Jesus died Peter forgot three and a half years in a matter of hours he said I need to find my boat who has who has my boot and if you remember Peter left his boat with a big catch of fish that is what caught his attention on that d if you remember this story he had fish all night and night before court nothing was washing his net was packing up Jesus came sat on his boat pulled he bought off he saw Jesus preach told him cast your nets plural into the water Peter class-one net gets more fish than he ever saw in his life but to get back up and help and walked away he leave he left his boat and his nets and everything and follow Jesus when Jesus died it's a comic frantic frantic you remember three and a half years ago when I left the fishing business you know who took the boats who have the nets I was two boats I had I left it right here I didn't really record where I left it you know who have it and then pizza not only that's enough he took Matthew who was the only disciples went and fish men who wasn't even fishermen what might you do in the tax any fish [Applause] but the nature wasn't changed legalism doesn't change your nature rules doesn't change in nature here in the world doesn't even change your nature and take the Holy Ghost it's it's fire to burn the snake out of your soul burn the desires burn the loss under evil burn the desire change your behavior from the inside out you may be seated somebody pitch black to me somebody in the house want a change wanna transformation [Applause] [Applause] when you meet the pillar of fire friends your walk is different your talk is different the way you dress is different the way you go to work is different the way you talk to your co-workers is different the way you say hi to your neighbor is different the way you pour the maxi is different the way you visit your family is different the way you come to church is different the way you greet the usher is different the way you greet the deacon is different the way you talk to your husband is different the way you speak me your wife is different because you were once a beggar now you are lamb now the Holy Ghost now the Dove now the angel of the Lord he could direct you to go where he wants you to go [Applause] because your nature is no longer a carnal nature it's no a divine nature and the church amen you may be seated everybody feeling fine I don't want to ask how many hugs we have this morning I don't want to ask how many sheep we have this morning but the real question is the theme of every apostle have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed because the Holy Ghost is what separates the Hogs from the Sheep the Holy Ghost is what separates the church from the bride Holy Ghost is who separates the remnant from the elect of God the fullness of the Spirit that's our promise and we have access to it now because of a prophet who restore the fullness of the word that the light of God could shine on the fullness of the world to bring forth the fullness of the Spirit not a show not a not a put on matter not a dress for church this morning and this is my best church outfit this is mature handshake this is the god bless you brother your characters in them until the middie mudhole [Applause] we could preach about mud holes all day long the problem is not the mud hole the problem is your nature I know the Prophet said after you receive the Holy Ghost then you make yourself a Christian [Applause] but if Adam said Isis not that the woman on the street will not be there but your response to them is different because temptation will always be there how you respond to the temptation is different between a hog and alone he says when a heart gets to the mud he's that's a dance he's that's the wall oh he he rock back because of core he misses inner the hoppers get trouble he hugs the conical competition you know but when every a gal tip is like a backslide as a different kinda is a different way when i hog city back slide back slightly like we said a lamb he said when it's falling in money it's not to cry it's not a bleat you got in each is different god help us to change our nature can you take some more I'm doing better than last week I'm on page 25 of 78 last week I believe a lot about phase four or five of 64 so percentage-wise we doing better from the same message why it had to be Shepard he said that's the reason that church members today indulge in the things of the world and friends that day is what messes up some of your worship and your consecration you playing games with the world and you have to know what your thorn in your flesh what your weakness is it's not the same for everybody there was a brother of my years ago he had a drinking problem and you know dong in Barataria ready for 9s component whenever each every mean rude yeah everybody get a couple but that's why I'd have a highway if you notice your problem you should be headed for the highway every time it's not on it not be a highway don't you have any main road because that's your issue you have to know your issue because you want to kill your issue until the fire burns everything out you have to guide your heart God your testimony scripture said make your calling and election sure because the holy ghost is attracted to the sanctified life sanctification is a choice in a message broken cisterns where the balance said you cannot make a man see the Word of God tell his nature has been changed when his neatest change from what he is the son of God and the Holy Spirit comes into him listen to the Prophet and speaking about being born again and I hope this helps on muddy because we have some real part-time Christians you know they're very good on Sundays maybe up til Monday maybe until 3 p.m. or until tomorrow low until the situation listen to the Prophet you can't be born without having a parent you ever heard this woman before so if you're born in the brotherhood of a church that's what you've got if you're born in a creed there you are but if you were born in God conceived in his word you got a new parent that's good ready to make his word known among which you speak it through you Oh a new parent that parent is good he's ready to take his word now that he's already spoke and lived in you and make it come to life see no you have your training now now you're ready you're ready to go into training No Child training that's the hard part when you think and I want you to get this you ought to do this and the word cuts you around and shows you something else and that's what we are honing in as a set the church in order for the word the cutters around until our behavior and our nature starts to look like the divine nature and you know I know I need this let me not talk about you I need this I don't want this thing I seen unity you know I need this because when I look in the mirror I want to see Jesus looking back at me when I look in the mirror of the world I want my nature to be like his nature I want my behavior to be like his behavior I want to forgive don't worry forgiving want to love the way he love I want to pray the way he prayed to be like Jesus that's my that's my desire that should be your desire that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word cuts you around and shows you something else why they believe that over that will make any different what they believe here's what God said you must be about the Father's business now you're getting born again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have a new parent so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you got a new nature you cannot tell me you are born again this is trouble yet people you ever meet somebody in on your job who said I people like I'm born again anybody ever met anybody like that in any job I'm a born again and when you listen to the music and he style any fashion any clothes anything you say well it's not the old nature is not dead but the pranam said in order if you're born again you've got a new pair and then you've got a new nature the old nature is dead and you've got a new nature you once was going one way no you're going another way you once was going this way now you're going this way your affections are set on things above a new affection you love the things of the world no more can you say that now you don't love the things of the world anymore or you're struggling to you you don't hear what man says how they laugh at you listen young people and see you all model or whatever it is like that you don't care because you're born of above and your affections are set on things above God's not ashamed of you and you're not esteemed of him is that your test of money so why is it people want to go to work and dress one way and come to church in just another way and why is it you want to sing in church and in the middle of the week you listen to music that's destroying your soul that Lucifer himself orchestrated you need to come back to the cross come back to Calvary come back to the upper room and have a Pentecost experience the change that all nature and don't nature that will love God and hate the things of the world I will love the word and eat the sin and come to church shame and I'm not gonna be too much longer no what kind of need to have you got them brother branham his nature if I had my father's nature then I do the things my father did but know that I'm born again it depends on who my father was if you're just born in the church you got a church father and you can call him father if you want to that's the profit I'm reading the courts you call them anything you want to because he's your father but if your father is God and you're born into the family of God you seek those things that put into God you can't wait for prayer meeting you cannot wait to read a spoken word book you can't wait to read the scripture because it's your life it's your source then you are God's child your nature is God's nature then when you hear some say oh our church believes that the day of miracles is passed how could you believe that there's of miracles has passed when the very nature of God is in you when he is all to get a miracle his nature is miracle his habits miracle I'm reading the Prophet his whole being is miracle how can you be anything else but miracle your new birth is miracle your new life is miracle even your nature's a miracle that's a prophet how can you look back and see them things are there this is right see you're a new creature a new creation I wanna nail this down friend because this is your promise and by these exceeding great and precious promises we could be partakers of his divine nature promise of the unity of one God in the one Church he said but the working of the holy spirit the kingdom of God in you God sets on the throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions and controlling your powers control your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ in brother Branham goes on then the love you go out seemingly the birds sing different or how different it is when Christ comes how you can look back and think how did I ever stay away from it how did I ever reject it everything is different you have no enemies they all look sweet you can forgive everything that's ever been done the bitterest of enemy you can pray for him in the street put your arm around him and lift him up no matter what creed what denomination he belongs to he's a creature who Christ died for that's what God wants you filled with that's the filling that's the kingdom that's what we're one in can the church seaman is this a desire you love the word this morning and by random goes on we are one then not to further a denomination not to further a cult or some Creed we are one to further the kingdom of God then we take his blueprint and every time the Blessed Bible says anything the Holy Spirit in you cries out it's all it's my wood it's my word adoption is my word perfection is my word seven live voices is my word charity coming down it's my word the dynamics or the mechanics is my word seven living voices it's my word that's the Thunder that shakes the devil that's my word it's prophetic it's a promise but that gives me access to his divine nature he don't say I'm still reading the same quote he don't see the dr. Jones say what about this or the doctor so-and-so makes no difference what doctor said so jesus said it's the truth and heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away that's when we are one now listen to the Prophet in the message faith in the Son of God could he take someone as I've said no man seeks after God God seeks after man Dudek on yourself bless this morning that he called you you know we sing that song I love him because he first loved me you know the Bible said there's no greater love and when a man could lay his life down and I realized that when we talk about God loving us and we loving him there really is no comparison because I'm not sure how many first raisin lay down our life for anybody to say we really love God our love is really limited any context can even be compared with God's love for us because if no greater love greater love is and he can lay a life down we are too selfish lay life tongfu but his love was so great he could lay his life down in our place when we deserve to be judged because the wages of sin is still death is not like time he's under GL sin and his debt and when we should have died he took our place because he loved us so much can we not love him back can we not serve Him and dedicate our lives to him man and his nature is a rebellion against God but God loves man since the fall in the Garden of Eden God has still been calling for his child he calls to him through the Thunder through the Lightning through the setting of the Sun through the preaching of the gospel through signs and wonders through prophets through miracles through visions God speaking to his people God trying to get your attention wake up look up your Redemption draweth nigh judgment over it and as the closing seconds of time run out whether the Branum said there come a time where the young people coming to the altar but the random said looking to be saved with it'll be too late because they have done cross the line and mercy is over grace is over because God start standing knocking on the door of your heart and you never opened up to him you keep the church but never open up to him came to church and see him hunt came the church same spirit keep the church never got his spirit came to church seemed nature came to church all nature came to church Conti correction came to church can't discipline yourself to separate from the world brother Branham said you have to separate yourself and then he said this if love doesn't get you desperate then conditions will and that's why but the band said compassion is not feeling sorry for people it's doing the will of God there's something that God allows to come your way to discipline you we can feel sorry compassion is knowing that it's God's will then you go to that trial that he can get your attention that you could serve Him because this body is temporary but your soul has an eternal destination so when this fails and this fades away God is interested in your eternal destination of your soul can the church say man I'm not gonna be too much longer with you for the Branham said I find this that the greatest power in the world is not your atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his mica [Music] I'll say that one more time the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature have you ever been in contact with your maker but the Branum said Moses was 40 years in Egypt trained in the ways of Egypt it took 40 years for Egypt to leave him as he spent the tamanna wilderness but that was not enough for Moses to deliver he had to come into contact with the pillar of fire he had to come into contact with God not as a group but as an individual have you had a personal experience with God have you had a personal encounter with God have you hit your knees and say Lord I want to meet you I want to hear your voice I want you to speak to my heart I want you to perform surgery take away my heart Lord I want a new heart Lord I want a new spirit Lord I want your spirit because he's calling you couldn't come on your own but because he called you you have a choice to respond he said my sheep hear my voice my sheep didn't know my voice are you hearing a call this morning to call for repentance the call to make things right the call to forgive the call for transformation the call for the Holy Ghost the call for baptism the call to halt the new horns of the altar and sigh and cry for the abomination in the city it's okay the come to church and shout and jump but is your soul change is your nature change how long will you come to church and go back home with your whole nature when will you see a Lord today's my day I can't go back this way not today not today Lord I've come too far but today I want a personal experience not with the preaching up with the church not with the message but a personal experience with God himself [Applause] Nicodemus was looking for something are you looking for something when Nicodemus found Jesus is he hold how can a man get this eternal life thing he said you must be born again he says shall I go back in my mother's womb again he had a desire what is your desire is your need great enough then you can lock everything else orphans in Lord this is my desire to worship you [Applause] [Music] yeah I noticed another service that everybody everybody jumps to and shouts to but it makes no sense comment to church jumping and shouting and knowing mysteries and no and there's no change your nature is the same and it's no good you come in and nobody's telling you your nature is not gonna make it because the Prophet taught us only perfect love will enter in only his nature will enter in we have to be partakers of his nature to enter him he must be with a look and see yes I see faith I see virtue I see knowledge I see temperance I see patients I see calling this I see brotherly kindness I see charity yes it looks like me yes this is one this is one there is my spirit flowing freely there's my daughter yes my son I could send him somewhere I could send him somewhere because he has surrendered his all he has given up the world he is giving up his desires he'll given up his ambitions he prays he cries out he reads the word he takes time any fast he takes time any praise party cos of his divine nature can you take some more the position of a believer in Christ I don't know me too much longer but first Corinthians 12 says by one spirit we all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ the body of believers see it by what not by one shake of hands not by one mode of baptism not by one feeling but by one spirit Great Spirit Holy Spirit by one spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah look at it where the random is describing bruised wounded tour opened up his side of the room and spear talking about Jesus in order that by the Holy Spirit we could be baptized into his body because of his divine nature look of the Prophet places in the context you get it then you become a partaker after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature Christ's nature in you how can you cheat steal lie blacks lie proselyte everything else with the divine nature of Christ in you it's impossible for the balance I'll let that soak just a few minutes cuz it's right well if you be a partaker in Christ then you become a new creature all things have passed away and all things become new all of our warnings and fussing and stewing and arguing's and Tempest and all these things pass away Oh hallelujah glory hallelujah can the church say man when you look at this word is that how you look but the man said what is the fruit of the Spirit we have planted it on church membership upon shouting upon demonstration of our works but the fruit of the Spirit is full of love who then is when you love those who are unlovable that's the Spirit of Christ love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience dear the fruit of the Spirit no matter what should she belong to what you have done glory glory hallelujah oh my I'm almost finished musician you get ready the world is falling apart but when he was crucified rose again and ascended to God on the day of Pentecost he came back in the form of this pillar of fire and separated himself no wonder we could party because he separated himself tongues of fire set upon each of them don't you want your own tongue of fire your own experience with God God dividing himself amongst his church dividing his nature among the church because that was his wife and a husband and wife is one together and God and the church is one together God in you that was God above us God with us God in us seem God all the time just three manifestations attributes or offices or whatever you want to call it like a Father Son and Holy Spirit is the same God all the time but the battle continues I want to lay it on thick church because this is your promise these are the exceeding promise exceeding great and precious that Christ Himself the tabernacle himself in 16 elements in you and you're a different person [Music] and now that I was caught above us could not be touched even a mountain that would be touch away he was there must be trust true in a darkest sin had not had an offering yet but when God came and was manifested among us this is the problem is reading a proper course now we handled him with our hands he said we said God first Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness the core was manifested in the flesh seen of angels and believed on in the world received up into glory see that was God with us God over us God with us now God in us all that God was he ported to Christ all that Christ was he ported to the church at that day you'll know that I am in the father the father in me I in you and you and me so it's been called all along you see his same works the churches are dealing to carry on his work with the same spirit you cannot carry on you couldn't carry on the same work without the same spirit that's right the same spirit carries on the work I'm almost done and a message the guide a guide that's the reason the coming of the seals and a finishing of the seven seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be where all the way a beer by that time she bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ that's brought without money it's paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ God is the one who gave the promise and he's more than able to bring the promise to pass he was the one who promised the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost nothing Peter could have done was what a change that promised from coming to pass Sarah laughed when God told Abraham you're gonna have a child it was he made the promise and he's big enough to keep a promise big enough to keep his word unconditional covenant sovereign covenant he signed both sides of the agreement there was none greater than himself so he swore by himself and prophesied there will be a bride that will come to perfection debía people in the land who under their messenger would be the final voice up to the final age and he doesn't need permission to say it he doesn't--he permission to call you he doesn't need permission to choose you nor does he permission to fill you somebody may be seated he wanted this man called Saul who we now called Paul Saul was riding on his own Road and God interrupted him on the road the way he was going because God was ready for him it wasn't Saul saying lord I want you but there was a promise over Saul's head that he didn't even know about he didn't know he was gonna be caught or write the book of Ephesians he didn't know he's gonna call the D right to the Romans tell Philippians and tribulations up he was living his life but the pillar of fire drop town and arrested him on his journey to Damascus and when he fell to his feet he knew who stopped him he knew who called him in knew who threw him town and that same God and not another that same chorus yet city that same power is here today that same authority is here today that she means oh the one with the swept-back wings up is here to team there's intense Redemption has intense healing has intense present tense not tomorrow now it is now faith is now fit is so you can worship you can rejoice you can give God praise because your healing is on its way your deliverance is on its way your adoption is on its way your perfection is on its way your attention is on its way charity is on its way dynamics is on its way Holy Ghost is on its way super church is on its way super race is on its way the headstone is on its way these are the exceeding great precious promises that we are feasting on this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I'm almost done but I'm not done yet you don't have to understand the promise to receive the promise you don't need to know the mechanics you just need to know the dynamics Mary said how shall this be how I'm gonna have this child talking about and the world was the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow thee marinate didn't need to get a technical details of how God is gonna bring the sperm and the egg together it did not matter to her she just heard the Holy Ghost it's gonna overshadow thee and I'm saying today every promise in the book is mine and the Holy Ghost is gonna bring it to pass because the Holy Ghost is the fire if the power is caught himself he was going above us he was caught with us now as spirit he's waiting to be in somebody maybe meets a tail or maybe use a different but it's the same God who opened the Red Sea the same God who broke down the walls of Jericho that same cord walked on the water that same cord to five Loza two fishes somebody preach back to me I got news for you that same God said little fish I give you back your life because I wasn't by the branham's weekend that was the divine nature being expressed true son of man it was the son of man merely a son of man but the Branham had no power of his owner Peter had no power of his owner Paul had no power of his own but they were all partakers of his divine nature hallelujah hallelujah give Him worship give him praise give him thanks thank you for the promise thank you for the promise thank him for the promise thank you for the promise Lord you promised it you promised the Holy Ghost you promised Reviver you promised deliverance huh you promised healing you promised a breakthrough you promised me my family you promised me my healing you promised me my time you promised me another book of Acts you promised another Ephesians you promised the true bride will come to her headship you promise that they will be one you promise it not [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah [Applause] whether you worship whether you laugh whether you doubt it's still gonna happen God spoke to Abraham and say Abraham you're gonna have a chance Cyril laughed because she did not believe when she looked at her condition that she was eligible she didn't believe that she was a candidate she did not believe she was an option she did not believe that she was qualified she didn't believe that quarter use her she believed her time was over she believed her deal was done she believed she couldn't make it so she laughs within herself even after the prophesy she got her servant girl Higa to go with Abraham because she didn't believe but when God speaks up he in his nature he can't even take it back up when God speaks he can't even change his mind he said Abraham you're gonna have a child by Sarah she rocket laughs how much you want to see Eric adult all she want to but Sarah is living and did you realize with nah I'm feeling better today then I felt yesterday I feel younger this month then I felt last month I feel younger this year it was 25 years god loves to turn the odds against you because if 25 years ago you couldn't have the child no it should be even more impossible because every year that pass makes it harder makes it more difficult but God loves when the other against you because when the other against you then he gets the glory then he gets the honor then he gets the worship because the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's he says no weapon formed against you could prosper that's an exceeding great and precious promise [Music] I'm um I'm finished I got more but when I'm done hallelujah there's a lot more but I gotta finish there's a lot more because yes joy unspeakable and full of glory Wendy will try to speak about did you see my cup runs over when I try to get in my cup it's more than my cup could handle because when God blesses it's more it's more than you can even handle in your house it's enough for your children it's enough for your neighborhood when you're blessed the Lord God added blessing and when he blessed there's no sorrow with it come on now that's your promise hallelujah that's a promise over your life oh he promised that weep in me and your for a night but joy comes in the morning what you're talking about what situation what sadness what depression what problem what trouble [Music] Oh hallelujah I'm finished but Anthony if you get ready but friends we are on our way out of here we have a promise of a rapture but before the rapture we also have a problem I have a promise to give the devil the final knockout punch the devil was there in the Ephesus age he was there in this money and age he was there in the present age he was there an entire town church age in the sadducee an age he was there in Philadelphia he was there and in this Laodicean age as we switch to connect with the headstone God has been waiting for our people so else army to rise up that's an exceeding great and precious promise and we have had the examples Paul said that where is your sing grave where is your victory the Prophet was an example of a partaker of his divine nature spoken word salvation spoken word healing power over the elements and that was just a foreshadow of what was to come because a group of people were being prepared to be collectively define what takers of His divine nature oh my my almost ready we almost ready remember that Randall is here he turned the devil's kingdom upside down the devil even finish adjusted back yet and we are get started yet we haven't gotten started yet but the problem shed the spirit the profit and the pride will say the same thing and what they have said will always will already have been said in the word listen the spirit has a voice the book of Revelation he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit say it for the spirit has a voice the prophet has a voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared his civils a prophet so the spirit has a voice and the Spirit has not stopped speaking but the Spirit use our prophet to bring a message in seed form to identify by promise what was the divine nature of God so pizza in case you missed it begin to express haven't done all this after your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge so you who are spiritual Peter started to describe the very divine nature of God and placed it as the virtues and the profit came behind and said this being when he is complete is the being that will go to the rapture this being when complete will represent partakers of the divine nature of God I listen with the man who said you may be seated for a minute if you want or you can see it standing doesn't matter but the Branham said on the day of Pentecost cloth divided himself in the end God is collecting himself he is bringing all the pieces together all the pieces all the sleepin seats the dead in Christ shall rise he's pulling throughout all the ages to himself a headstone picking up everything how are you gonna miss it when this is in you when the divine nature is in you he has to call you he has to call you he has to call you he has to call you because you are part of him she is him when he sees you he say flesh of my flesh bone of my bone there's my spirit fluent freely how could he leave his wife how could he leave his bride we are the bride of Jesus Christ that's who we are that's our promise that's our inheritance middle or dress
