[15:21] and due time amen so tonight we want to
[15:24] look at some scriptures
[15:26] uh
[15:27] it's my portion to be here tonight
[15:29] matthew chapter 21 we wrote from read
[15:32] from verse 28 to 31
[15:35] matthew chapter 7
[15:36] when we read from 18 to 21
[15:39] and ephesians 5
[15:41] we want to read from verse 14 to 17. so
[15:44] we want to go to matthew chapter 21
[15:47] verse 28
[15:49] and this is jesus
[15:54] a certain man had two sons
[15:57] and he came to the first and said son
[16:00] go work today in my vineyard
[16:03] the answer that said i will not
[16:06] but afterward
[16:07] he repented and went
[16:10] he came to the second said likewise and
[16:12] he answered i said i go sir
[16:15] and when not
[16:17] whether of them tween
[16:19] did the will of his father
[16:22] they say unto him the first
[16:25] and jesus
[16:26] said unto them
[16:28] verily i say unto you
[16:30] the republicans and harlots go into the
[16:33] kingdom of god
[16:35] before you
[16:37] matthew chapter 7
[16:38] you want to read from verse 18.
[16:42] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[16:44] fruit
[16:46] neither can a corrupt tree been fought
[16:48] good fruit
[16:50] every tree
[16:52] that bringeth not for good fruit is
[16:54] hewned on
[16:55] and cast into the fire
[16:58] wherefore
[16:59] by their fruits you shall know them
[17:03] not everyone that said unto me lord lord
[17:05] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[17:08] but he
[17:09] that do it the will of my father
[17:12] which is in heaven
[17:14] our last scripture tonight is from
[17:16] ephesians 5 14 to 17
[17:19] wherefore he saith a week though that
[17:20] sleepers
[17:22] arise from the dead
[17:24] and christ shall give the light
[17:26] see then
[17:28] that he walks circumspectly not as fools
[17:31] but as wise
[17:33] redeeming the time
[17:35] because
[17:36] the days are evil
[17:39] wherefore
[17:40] be not unwise
[17:42] but understanding
[17:44] what the will of the lord is
[17:47] and for a title tonight of this bible
[17:50] study
[17:51] understanding
[17:53] what the will of the lord is
[17:55] so may god bless you
[17:57] and i trust that you're doing fine under
[18:00] that you're holding up
[18:02] under
[18:03] the stress of the test
[18:06] the stress of the test that you could
[18:07] pull up because that is what it is it's
[18:10] being
[18:10] tested being tried
[18:13] you know i was thinking about brother
[18:14] branham's life today and a portion of it
[18:17] when he did not
[18:19] obey god
[18:21] and he lost his wife
[18:23] he lost his baby his child
[18:26] he lost the anointing for five years
[18:30] and
[18:31] i guess
[18:32] in going through that experience it
[18:34] would have been so hard for him
[18:36] as a young minister
[18:38] a young man
[18:39] serving the lord the best are you know
[18:41] how and
[18:42] make a wrong turn if i could use that
[18:45] word in term of obeying god
[18:48] and
[18:49] later on in the years
[18:51] when i guess he could look back at the
[18:53] experience
[18:55] he could
[18:56] speak in adoption he could turn your
[18:58] wife against you he could turn the
[18:59] church against you you can do this he
[19:01] could cast a better sickness
[19:03] and
[19:04] he said he was just testing me
[19:06] so you know
[19:08] sometimes when you are going through
[19:10] what you're going through
[19:12] you feel like
[19:14] nobody understands nobody knows what
[19:17] really is happening
[19:18] and uh maybe you alone go into what
[19:20] you're going through you're not
[19:22] the others are going to identical what
[19:24] you're going to challenged and so on
[19:26] like that
[19:27] and it takes the hand of god and the
[19:30] mercy of god to minister and to help
[19:32] them they all of me
[19:34] you know we speak the word we share the
[19:35] word we share the gospel
[19:37] but god is who really know what is
[19:40] operating in the heart
[19:42] and but isaac gave a powerful teaching
[19:45] on jonah and
[19:47] it's really inspiring
[19:49] to see a note
[19:51] that
[19:52] jonah
[19:53] even though he did god's will eventually
[19:58] by the fish delivering him to preach the
[20:00] new
[20:01] his heart couldn't handle
[20:03] his the expectation of how god will
[20:05] behave which is to forgive
[20:08] and pardon
[20:10] and make amends to those who willing to
[20:12] repent
[20:14] so tonight we want to get down in this
[20:15] thing and see what lord will do
[20:17] see how it will unfold
[20:19] i trust it would help you
[20:21] try now especially even with the bible
[20:24] studies to see and have a heart
[20:27] to what you could apply in your own life
[20:29] what you are hearing
[20:31] because too many are caught up in
[20:34] knowledge
[20:35] and understanding in revelation
[20:37] explanation information
[20:40] and
[20:40] very little of application
[20:44] and um
[20:46] life have to do with application
[20:49] not just information but how you apply
[20:53] how you apply
[20:54] things when challenges come when
[20:56] situation comes how you deal with it how
[20:58] you manage it
[21:00] and only experience could bring you
[21:03] from stage to stage to stage
[21:05] david had beer
[21:07] lion
[21:09] anya golan nobody said me test people
[21:11] saying after beers lying after
[21:14] no
[21:15] life unfolded
[21:17] situation came
[21:18] and he met the challenge
[21:21] our challenge
[21:22] should not be in church
[21:24] let me say that again
[21:26] our challenge
[21:28] shouldn't even be with the word
[21:30] our challenge truly should be with
[21:32] ourselves
[21:34] and we are our greatest enemy
[21:37] and i was sharing something with
[21:39] i think my son
[21:40] um
[21:42] and
[21:43] you know about
[21:44] the destructions of the external
[21:48] where
[21:49] you could blame this one that one the
[21:50] boss you know everything is external and
[21:54] outside
[21:55] and when the external fades
[21:58] and you realize it's not about the
[22:00] external it's but it's what's happening
[22:02] on the inside
[22:04] so tonight
[22:06] understanding what the word of the lord
[22:08] is and not to be a fool
[22:10] not to be unwise
[22:13] but really
[22:14] settling down
[22:16] to ask a question
[22:18] of god's will for your own life
[22:21] god's will god's plan god's purpose god
[22:25] intent
[22:26] not anybody else
[22:28] the will of god for your life so let me
[22:30] share some words
[22:32] with you from brother braham and we will
[22:34] see how we take it from there
[22:36] um i don't know how much of a teaching
[22:37] will be i'll be sharing some quotes and
[22:39] some scriptures and something like that
[22:41] i just would have you but around
[22:44] i think that unless we know the word of
[22:46] god
[22:47] we don't know what to do
[22:50] we can't have faith until we know what
[22:54] is the will of god
[22:56] and then if we know it is the will of
[22:58] god the word of god says something we
[23:00] can gladly follow that now if jesus
[23:03] walk on the earth tonight human flesh
[23:05] here tomorrow it will be raining all day
[23:06] long it would be very easy for me to
[23:09] take an umbrella and leave in the
[23:10] morning because he said it
[23:12] but if he didn't see it
[23:14] i don't know then what to look for
[23:16] so that's the way it is in anything we
[23:18] do
[23:19] we want to know the hour
[23:22] and to know the hour and the age we are
[23:23] living now to the newcomers this week
[23:26] we tried to show that god from the
[23:28] beginning
[23:29] and you heard it sunday was infinite
[23:31] or if he wasn't infinity isn't god so
[23:33] he's got to be omnipotent omnipresent
[23:36] omniscient
[23:37] to be god that is all power knows all
[23:40] things in all places
[23:42] knows the end from the beginning
[23:44] therefore he knows all about what you're
[23:46] going through and what gonna happen
[23:48] so let's continue now the one principle
[23:51] of us being here
[23:53] and then trying to help you
[23:54] and the only way that i know christian
[23:56] friend to help you is to get your feet
[23:59] the best
[24:00] i can by the word of god
[24:03] centered
[24:04] on the will of god for you
[24:07] i want you to think about that
[24:09] he said the best way he could help
[24:12] is to get your feet
[24:15] centered
[24:16] on the will of god for you i remember
[24:20] and gave a story of a young man who had
[24:21] according to africa
[24:23] on the fields
[24:24] and he had a board of elders and a board
[24:26] of
[24:27] whoever is a church board
[24:29] and they interviewed him and they said
[24:32] he'd have malaria there he'd have
[24:33] dystere he's up that they're trying to
[24:35] discourage him
[24:37] and he said he just felt that this is
[24:38] the calling that god put up on his life
[24:40] and eventually he broke out and said if
[24:42] god is leading me to be dear he will
[24:44] take care of me there and that is the
[24:47] fate in
[24:48] the call of god
[24:50] and this is where
[24:52] you have to find yourself plugged in
[24:55] you know not
[24:56] reacting to what others do
[24:58] and to what others see
[25:01] but coming to the spot where
[25:03] you do what god wants you to do
[25:07] now i know many of you will remember
[25:10] that
[25:11] a saying that i give many times that
[25:13] maturity is when you accept
[25:14] responsibility for your actions and your
[25:16] attitude
[25:18] no blaming
[25:20] and in life this is something that i go
[25:23] by
[25:24] you choose your actions
[25:26] if you don't choose your actions you'll
[25:28] find yourself reacting to things
[25:30] sometimes you get hot you get tempered
[25:33] you get anger you know and you're
[25:34] reacting
[25:35] you choose to love you choose to forgive
[25:38] you choose to
[25:39] pray for others you choose to be helpful
[25:42] you choose to be kind this is your
[25:44] choice
[25:45] and you choose that way
[25:47] regardless of the person's response
[25:51] this is not well i will scratch your
[25:53] back because i want you to scratch minds
[25:55] this is not that
[25:57] this is truly
[25:59] your choice in other words
[26:02] because though has chosen
[26:04] it becomes powerful
[26:06] when you know
[26:08] that you are in god's will
[26:10] it becomes absolutely powerful
[26:13] because when you know you are engaged
[26:15] with
[26:16] no demon
[26:17] no devil no weapon
[26:20] nothing
[26:21] could come against you and stop you
[26:23] when you know you are the will of god
[26:26] that is why it is so important to get a
[26:29] hold of getting this will of god as the
[26:31] center point of your life
[26:34] because if god shut a door in your face
[26:36] that is god's will you can rejoice
[26:39] you could shout
[26:40] because it's not you shut the door
[26:42] it's gorgeous
[26:44] if things doesn't work out to the left
[26:47] he doesn't want you to go left
[26:49] he wants to go right
[26:50] and you would see
[26:52] as the will of god unfolding your life
[26:54] more and more you'll be get sensitive to
[26:57] your spirit directing and leading your
[27:00] life
[27:01] so let's continue by god's grace
[27:03] okay
[27:04] so let he said again the best that i can
[27:06] by the word of god is centered on the
[27:08] will of god for you
[27:10] if you can only see
[27:13] that it is god's will to do these things
[27:15] for you
[27:16] it is god's will to save you all
[27:19] it is god's will to heal you all and he
[27:21] will certainly lead you into deeper
[27:23] depths and higher heights if you trust
[27:25] him
[27:26] don't be satisfied with your fire built
[27:30] here from last night this is last night
[27:33] let's build it to a little further
[27:35] tonight
[27:36] never build it in the same place you
[27:38] can't stand still you are either
[27:40] backsliding or going forward
[27:44] let me see it again he said can't stand
[27:46] still
[27:47] you're either back sliding
[27:48] or going forward
[27:50] where you are tonight
[27:52] let's continue jesus
[27:54] we know the scriptures in john 4 before
[27:56] he say my need
[27:57] is to do the will of him that sent me
[28:00] and to finish the work
[28:04] and he said all the father
[28:06] give it me shall come to me
[28:09] in john 6
[28:11] 37 and him that committed me i will no
[28:13] wise caster
[28:15] for i came down from him
[28:17] not to do my own will
[28:20] but the will of him
[28:22] that sent me
[28:24] and this is the father's will which had
[28:27] sent me
[28:28] that all which he had given me
[28:31] i should lose nothing
[28:34] but should raise it up again in the last
[28:36] day
[28:38] this and this is the will of him that
[28:40] sent me
[28:42] that everyone which see at the sun
[28:45] and believe it on him
[28:47] we have everlasting life
[28:49] and i will raise him up
[28:51] at the last day
[28:53] and i was thinking of the illness of the
[28:56] don payment of the baptism of the holy
[28:58] ghost
[28:59] which is a down payment of our
[29:01] inheritance a deposit that guarantees
[29:03] resurrection
[29:05] that guarantees your inheritance
[29:07] a down payment
[29:09] a title
[29:10] evidence of purchase
[29:12] all these things is guaranteed it said
[29:15] grieve not the holy spirit whereby you
[29:17] are sealed until the day of your
[29:19] redemption
[29:21] you know
[29:22] we hear gospel and hear word and
[29:25] sometimes you don't know
[29:27] what level of consciousness is rich in
[29:29] us
[29:30] the subconscious the conscious
[29:32] how deep is it to understand that we
[29:35] have been purchased
[29:37] you know and the devil can't do anything
[29:38] about it satan lost his estate in him
[29:43] kicked out on the earth
[29:45] and there is no way for him to regain
[29:47] that estate
[29:49] it is incredible
[29:51] that he could see mere mortars humans
[29:54] born in sin shaved iniquity
[29:57] coming to sonship
[29:59] into godship
[30:00] into inheritance is almost like a
[30:02] nightmare for the enemy
[30:04] to see that fallen man
[30:07] could come
[30:09] and be redeemed
[30:10] and to be restored on earth
[30:13] as if they never did sin it's a powerful
[30:16] thing
[30:17] he has no chance whatsoever
[30:20] of getting into this position of sonship
[30:23] godship
[30:24] inheritance adoption
[30:27] dominion he has no chance whatsoever
[30:30] he is dependent on bodies
[30:33] that he can use
[30:35] he's a spirit
[30:37] that has no real authority and right on
[30:40] the street
[30:42] man who was placed here spirit plus dust
[30:45] and
[30:46] unliving soul man
[30:48] who was given the place on it has that
[30:51] right
[30:51] to be here on earth not not satan
[30:55] so that is why he have to find temples
[30:58] bodies
[30:59] people
[31:00] that he could anoint and inspire and use
[31:03] he needs them
[31:05] and just as he needs them
[31:07] the spirit of god
[31:09] need bodies
[31:11] temples
[31:13] you
[31:14] you you here tonight
[31:17] his spirit needs you
[31:19] let me go a little deeper
[31:23] jesus
[31:25] when he says you are the branch
[31:27] he means that
[31:29] he means
[31:31] that true you
[31:33] i
[31:34] would be able to produce fruit
[31:38] now he needs you
[31:40] to produce fruit
[31:42] or
[31:43] we could see it this way he needs you to
[31:46] be a channel by which divine life
[31:50] could flow through
[31:51] and by extension
[31:54] produce fruit
[31:56] jesus is a master builder
[32:00] he
[32:02] is truly god
[32:06] by calling these 12 disciples
[32:09] you know
[32:10] some men
[32:12] they like to have the preeminences
[32:14] whether they are ceo or whatever it is
[32:16] they like the name on the board the name
[32:18] on the building the name everywhere
[32:20] right i know somebody who
[32:23] you know love his name everywhere
[32:24] the more his name show up the better he
[32:26] feels and
[32:30] they could disappear
[32:32] and the reason that they could disappear
[32:35] is because
[32:37] what they have seeded on and reproduced
[32:40] what they have led others to do is to
[32:42] produce more of themselves or replicas
[32:45] of what they can do that is what you
[32:48] call effective leadership
[32:51] so when that leader dies or come off the
[32:54] scene everything doesn't fold up
[32:57] because
[32:58] you have extended the vision and the
[33:00] purpose of the plan to others
[33:03] this is what jesus did
[33:05] he took these brothers from fishing from
[33:08] castle
[33:09] from tax collector all kinds of people
[33:12] and he prayed father that they might
[33:15] believe through these guys
[33:17] that i and you are one
[33:19] he actually
[33:21] removed himself
[33:23] and lose these sons to write another
[33:26] book about
[33:28] and peter step out
[33:30] in such a glorious fashion silver gold i
[33:32] will have such as i have i've given
[33:34] speeches step out and it was amazing
[33:37] because this is the same peter that deny
[33:39] christ
[33:40] showing that peter was a god man
[33:44] he was a man
[33:45] just like elijah just like all these
[33:47] other brothers like passion had their
[33:50] failures had their challenges have their
[33:51] ups and downs
[33:53] but when
[33:54] the holy ghost
[33:56] took
[33:57] the right place on the heart of these
[33:59] brothers it was something completely
[34:00] different altogether
[34:02] and i'm seeing tonight
[34:04] that god the holy ghost
[34:07] would take his right place
[34:10] in the throne of your heart
[34:12] that is what you are called for
[34:15] you are not called into a church pew
[34:18] you are not called to each bench
[34:22] you're not called
[34:23] to join church
[34:26] you are called to be a living
[34:27] representative
[34:29] of the kingdom of god
[34:31] now we read some scriptures and
[34:33] we'll show a time together
[34:36] jesus gave a parable of a man two sons
[34:39] and one said he said
[34:41] one work
[34:42] he said i will not
[34:44] then he repented and he went
[34:46] and woke
[34:47] the other son said i will sir never did
[34:50] it
[34:51] never did it
[34:53] in other words his words
[34:55] and his actions
[34:57] was not in harmony
[34:59] his confession
[35:00] and his behavior was not in harmony
[35:04] what god wants is our confession and our
[35:07] behavior not in harmony no the first
[35:09] brother
[35:11] his words
[35:13] was ultra harmony also he said i will
[35:14] not do it but he repented
[35:17] what that would repent now
[35:19] he repented and went and do it and the
[35:21] question was asked who
[35:23] did the will of the father
[35:25] first one
[35:27] and jesus ripped through them and said
[35:29] my god he said hearts and whatnot will
[35:32] enter to the kingdom of god before them
[35:33] other people
[35:35] i want to bring a point
[35:37] that there is a will of god for your
[35:39] life
[35:41] i am not talking about a confession
[35:43] confession or a profession
[35:45] or what you believe
[35:47] i'm not talking about your belief
[35:50] i am talking about the will
[35:52] and the will is to do
[35:54] let me say it again
[35:55] to will is not to talk
[35:58] the will is to do
[36:01] you know
[36:02] my brother sometimes you know we go
[36:03] through stuff sometimes
[36:05] you know you don't know if it's
[36:06] depression or whatever it is
[36:08] your mind have things and your body
[36:10] don't want to cooperate
[36:12] and you just always seem to pull it
[36:14] together to get things done
[36:17] you have things you would like to do
[36:18] when you're just not getting dear it's
[36:20] just struggle it's a battle
[36:22] you know but there are things to be done
[36:25] and jesus said it i come to do thy will
[36:27] of god as is written on me in the volume
[36:30] of the book
[36:31] so jesus
[36:33] oh let me just read this here
[36:36] god's people
[36:39] came to a place where they wanted to
[36:41] change the program
[36:43] they look upon the philistines
[36:45] the american lights the hittites and
[36:48] they wanted to be like them they wanted
[36:50] a king
[36:51] okay
[36:52] so
[36:54] he says here though that
[36:57] it has never been in any age god's
[36:59] intention
[37:00] for his people to act like the people of
[37:03] the world or to be governed or
[37:05] controlled like the people of the world
[37:07] gorge people has always has been a
[37:09] peculiar people a different people are
[37:12] called out separated altogether
[37:14] different in their action in their ways
[37:17] in their manner of living and the
[37:19] peoples of the world has their appetites
[37:21] for things all their makeup has been
[37:23] always contrary to the things
[37:26] that the people of the world desire
[37:28] now the people of israel came to samuel
[37:30] and said no you are getting old
[37:33] and your sons do not walk in your way
[37:36] because they wasn't true like samuel
[37:38] they were bribers speakers of money and
[37:41] they said samuel your voice is not like
[37:43] you so we want you to go out and find us
[37:46] a king
[37:47] and anoint him
[37:49] and make us a people like the rest of
[37:52] the people of the world
[37:53] so samuel tried to tell them
[37:56] that that would not work
[37:57] he said if you do that the first thing
[37:59] you know you'll find out you call you
[38:01] your sons from your home and make
[38:03] soldiers out to them to run before his
[38:05] chariots and their hours and spears not
[38:07] only that you will call your daughters
[38:09] to make because of bread and take them
[38:11] away from you to feed the army besides
[38:13] all of that he will take taxes over you
[38:15] of your grain of income he will tax all
[38:18] that up to make certain government debts
[38:19] and so forth
[38:21] i think you are all together making a
[38:23] mistake
[38:24] but the people said
[38:26] we still want to be like the rest of the
[38:28] people now there is something about men
[38:30] and women that they long to be like one
[38:33] another
[38:34] and there has only been one man ever
[38:36] lived that was our example as the lord
[38:38] jesus christ
[38:39] he was the perfect example of what we
[38:42] should be
[38:43] about always about the father's business
[38:46] and doing what is right
[38:48] but no matter how much samuel tried to
[38:49] persuade the people continually they
[38:51] went after him day and night we want a
[38:54] king
[38:55] we want a man we want a man that we can
[38:58] say this is our guide
[39:01] here we go
[39:02] are you ready church listen
[39:05] and that
[39:07] has never been the will of god
[39:10] can i repeat it
[39:12] that has never been the will of god
[39:17] it never was the will of god
[39:20] or never will be the will of god
[39:23] for man
[39:25] to rule
[39:26] over one another
[39:28] god rules over man
[39:32] god is our ruler our king
[39:35] i hope this solidifies
[39:37] why i blast the spirit of man so much
[39:41] and blast in nicoletan spirit so much
[39:44] and blast the manipulative control that
[39:47] ministers have over god's people
[39:50] it is wrong
[39:52] it is wrong it is dead wrong it's
[39:56] supposed to be the spirit
[39:58] governing
[39:59] the spirit directed
[40:02] the spirit leading
[40:04] and
[40:05] i'm call it prophetic utterance coming
[40:07] out of it
[40:09] inspiration coming out from the earth
[40:12] he says the spirit
[40:14] the prophet
[40:15] and the bride
[40:16] will say the same thing
[40:18] and what they say
[40:20] will already be said in the word
[40:22] i want you to think now
[40:24] i am not a prophet
[40:26] i am not a messenger
[40:29] i am under a prophetic message
[40:32] so i don't have my own message
[40:35] i cannot label it as if i produce and
[40:38] have a message
[40:40] we speak what god speak and god speaks
[40:43] to his servants the prophets
[40:46] man shall live by bread alone but by
[40:48] every word which proceed out of the
[40:51] mouth of god and the mouth of god is not
[40:54] it's prophets
[40:56] they are the top layer that speaks for
[40:58] god
[40:59] so when we get the words from the
[41:01] prophets and speak it back
[41:03] those are words
[41:05] from god
[41:06] do you get that tonight
[41:08] so it's not we are trying something and
[41:10] you know my ministry and and what i've
[41:13] seen in this i'm seeing it so i think
[41:15] it's honestly so
[41:18] i have not seen it so it's a vision of
[41:21] god
[41:22] going the bible ezekiel i was in the
[41:23] spirit and i saw
[41:26] and god took me here and i saw
[41:29] speak son of man
[41:30] speak what those seers i looked and i
[41:33] saw
[41:34] and i saw this
[41:36] i saw that
[41:37] when god caught up moses into the
[41:40] heavenlies
[41:41] he says see
[41:42] and go downstairs and back on earth and
[41:45] make after the tabernacle make things
[41:48] based upon what you saw
[41:50] this is what vision is about
[41:53] that's why they're so important to
[41:54] understand why god speaks the prophets
[41:57] by vision
[41:58] you could have to see it
[42:00] now it's hard
[42:02] to translate vision into words
[42:05] that's why they rather talk about write
[42:06] the vision make it plain
[42:08] so it's as if you have to see the same
[42:10] vision under the same anointing to speak
[42:13] it back
[42:15] least we run and have our own
[42:17] interpretation
[42:19] amen so let's continue
[42:22] so brother branham says very much the
[42:23] same peril today
[42:25] they choose a man named sword which was
[42:26] the son of kish reputable man
[42:29] handsome man brilliant man but that's
[42:32] the kind of man people like to choose
[42:33] today the people does not seem satisfied
[42:36] with the way that god placed his church
[42:39] to be governed and controlled by the
[42:41] holy spirit they want somebody
[42:44] some man
[42:45] some denomination some certain people
[42:48] stick up in the church they are not able
[42:50] to throw themselves completely into
[42:51] god's hands to be spiritual to be led by
[42:54] the holy spirit they want somebody to do
[42:56] their religion for them somebody that
[42:58] will tell them just how to do it all
[42:59] about it
[43:01] now
[43:01] i'm almost finishing this part here it's
[43:04] a whole lot like today we like to choose
[43:07] such people to to control our churches
[43:10] to control the church of god nothing
[43:12] that i have to say against it but just
[43:14] to make a point
[43:16] it is not here we go
[43:18] it is not one
[43:20] it was not true and it will never be the
[43:24] will of god for such to be
[43:27] god
[43:28] is to rule his people to govern each
[43:32] individual
[43:33] did you hear that
[43:35] god
[43:36] is to rule
[43:38] over his people
[43:41] to govern who
[43:43] each
[43:45] individual
[43:46] say individual
[43:48] that's what you are tonight
[43:50] an individual
[43:52] okay
[43:53] so watch
[43:54] so brother branham was talking about
[43:57] um
[43:58] the senior position in christ and the
[44:00] missions of israel is something that we
[44:02] know remember how we hung on that how
[44:04] many here this morning let's see the
[44:06] mystery of israel is not just a little
[44:08] thing it's a mystery god's will is a
[44:10] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[44:13] will of god for his whole life god's
[44:16] mystery how much time i've preached this
[44:18] how much time i've shared this and i
[44:20] want to ask a question have you ever
[44:21] prayed and asked god
[44:23] for the will of god for your life and
[44:25] who will open it up to you that you will
[44:27] know that you are in god's will you are
[44:30] in god's plan you're in god's program
[44:32] you're conscious of it and as you get
[44:35] more and more conscious of it you could
[44:37] challenge the enemy when he comes in
[44:39] your grounds understands your wrongdoing
[44:41] because you remember in the will of god
[44:44] when
[44:45] when when when peter challenged jesus
[44:48] and said lord when did jesus walk on
[44:50] your water and and jesus peter said lord
[44:52] if that is you beat me to come
[44:55] that was clean a clean challenge is that
[44:57] you let me come
[44:59] jesus said come
[45:00] that was a direct
[45:02] just said the lord the word come
[45:04] peter come peter have faith peter step
[45:07] up right and when peter's had to step on
[45:09] he's had a walk
[45:10] now all these cyprus they could say what
[45:12] they want peter walk on wood
[45:15] okay walking towards jesus
[45:17] devil kick up a stone
[45:19] and when he looked at the waves he got
[45:20] his side off of jesus he began to sing
[45:24] jesus was obligated to help him when he
[45:27] said lord i'm thinking healthy obligated
[45:30] you know why
[45:31] he was responding to the call to the
[45:34] call of god
[45:35] did you respond to the call of god did
[45:37] you call yourself
[45:38] isn't it god i'd call you you didn't set
[45:41] up application said god i waited for you
[45:42] to call me you know you was in bar he
[45:44] was smoking drinking god himself called
[45:47] you you hear what i said was not pastor
[45:50] wasn't a preacher
[45:52] does the spirit of god
[45:54] call you
[45:55] and he have a responsibility to take
[45:58] care of you and to pull you through do
[46:00] you see that tonight
[46:01] if you are willing to repent of your
[46:04] behavior of your attitude if there is to
[46:05] repent repent
[46:07] and god will help you
[46:09] amen praise the lord so i trust tonight
[46:11] that this will be helpful for you
[46:13] all right
[46:14] jesus last words mark 16
[46:18] 15 to 20
[46:19] jesus is about to depart he said unto
[46:22] them go in go ye into all the world
[46:26] and preach the gospel to every creature
[46:28] it is believable and is baptized shall
[46:30] be saved
[46:31] either believe it or not shall be done
[46:34] and these signs
[46:36] shall
[46:37] follow them that believe
[46:39] in my name we shall cast our devils they
[46:42] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[46:44] take up serpents and if they drink and
[46:47] be deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[46:50] they shall lay hands on the sick
[46:52] and they shall recover
[46:54] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[46:55] them he would receive up into heaven sat
[46:58] at the right hand of god and they went

[49:01] needs shall cast our devils they shall
[49:03] speak with your tongues if they take
[49:05] observance or drink their meetings it
[49:06] shall not harm them and if they lay
[49:08] hands on the sickness are recovered no
[49:10] that is what jesus said for them to do
[49:12] in his name they deny that exist
[49:15] but they go and do just contrary to what
[49:17] he said
[49:19] teach that it is past there is nothing
[49:22] to it teach theology instead no wonder
[49:25] which condition we are in look here my
[49:27] brother

[50:30] of the holy ghost stephen follow that
[50:33] it's a terminology being used full of
[50:34] the holy ghost not for the talk

[50:49] shores paul was picking up some sticks
[50:50] he went and laid them on the fire india
[50:53] was a big super grabbing by the hand or
[50:55] the serpent injected poison in the hand
[50:58] that would have killed him within a
[50:59] minute the native said watch the fellow
[51:01] fall dead he will die just in a minute
[51:04] he's in chains for preaching the gospel
[51:06] watch slip
[51:07] him to the hand now watch paul didn't
[51:09] fear

[51:12] up siblings it shall not harm them so he
[51:13] walks over shakes off in the fire turns
[51:16] around walk away get some sticks put on
[51:18] the fire turn himself around warm his

[54:51] is across darkness on no corona virus no
[54:54] lockdown no no vaccine
[54:57] people want to make them vaccinate
[54:58] marketing beasts they know what
[55:00] abandonment says
[55:02] rejecting the seed of god is to take the
[55:04] marketplace he said the people are being
[55:07] marked right now like before that corona
[55:09] virus before it had vaccine before they
[55:11] always strip it off and british talk the
[55:14] people are being marked now for future
[55:16] judgment you are being marked to be
[55:19] sealed with the holy ghost or marked to
[55:21] take the basis
[55:23] so nobody's going to come and tell me
[55:24] i'm piping my head if that's nothing in
[55:26] it i will give me rome pray over the
[55:29] vaccine i'd have nothing to do with me
[55:31] i'd have nothing with no brain to grieve
[55:33] not the holy spirit glory whereby you
[55:35] are sealed until their redemption the
[55:38] seal of god is the holy ghost that is
[55:40] what we're supposed to be focusing on is
[55:42] seal of god not on vaccine and what in
[55:45] it and what it meant and what not in it
[55:46] i don't care what it could be punctuated
[55:48] juice
[55:49] and mango syrup it doesn't matter all
[55:51] the vaccinating all these years and
[55:53] never answer question of what's inside
[55:55] the vaccine because i am not a scientist
[55:58] oh glory to god when i go to africa i'll
[56:00] take malaria tablets i'd take this let
[56:02] me take it man if i don't take it and
[56:04] work
[56:05] i'll come back sick like a dog then you
[56:07] might have sick i can't preach
[56:08] afterwards

[56:14] different countries i have to show them
[56:16] a yellow fever card why i have to do
[56:18] that

[56:23] yellow fever you have to have your
[56:25] yellow fever card or they will not allow

[56:32] don't be foolish
[56:34] don't be this is serious as i said
[56:37] before satan if he could cut you off
[56:39] before time he will do so
[56:41] he will cut you off because he let the
[56:42] cut of potential

[56:46] ribbon in egypt and a cut of jesus that
[56:49] that's that's their job cut you off

[57:49] mysteries

[57:51] long services no not full of the holy
[57:54] ghost
[57:54] okay cooper doing one year
[57:57] what all the children's feelings are in
[57:58] two thousand years he said what we need
[58:00] in our churches
[58:02] is a man
[58:03] that got some absolute
[58:06] what we need in the methodist church the
[58:08] baptist church pentecostal church the
[58:10] presbyterian church is an is an absolute
[58:13] a man of god
[58:15] that will stand tied to the word unto
[58:18] christ hear that word unto christ here
[58:20] we go
[58:21] and bring that congregation
[58:24] under the condition to where
[58:27] each member walks
[58:30] in the condition of this word
[58:33] seeing that word manifested
[58:36] follow them
[58:38] these signs shall follow them i believe
[58:40] and this is my burden tonight
[58:42] that each individual will come listen
[58:44] carefully in the condition of the word
[58:48] super ibrahim is presenting something
[58:51] that is outside the realm of church
[58:54] this is you
[58:56] having a desire
[58:58] to come into a world condition
[59:02] not church listen millions of people go
[59:06] to church
[59:08] they are not examining their lives
[59:12] they're not looking in the mirror of the
[59:13] world
[59:14] that is not the burden
[59:17] right now
[59:18] there are people who rejoice and do not
[59:20] take any vaccine
[59:22] they are deceived
[59:24] not by not taking a vaccine
[59:26] but by
[59:28] their thinking
[59:30] by not taking the vaccine they are the
[59:32] bride
[59:34] or by thinking by not taking the vaccine
[59:36] they're not taking any macritis
[59:38] they are received they come like
[59:40] somebody wearing a long dress long to
[59:41] their ankle and judging somebody who
[59:43] have a dress covering their knees and
[59:46] they think their long dress is a ticket
[59:49] to glory because their dress is longer
[59:50] than that one who cover their knees
[59:53] because their standard is the dresser to
[59:55] be by your ankle
[59:58] they judging things in their own mind
[1:00:00] i call it the god of their own
[1:00:02] imagination
[1:00:03] you can't go there
[1:00:06] you can't do that
[1:00:07] you have to see what god requires of us
[1:00:10] so brother i'm saying hear me
[1:00:13] you display the token all you believe in
[1:00:16] is in vain
[1:00:17] this is not us
[1:00:19] this is the world
[1:00:21] he's not talking about the token he
[1:00:23] talked about the token displayed
[1:00:25] it's not the same
[1:00:27] we can preach talking
[1:00:29] explain talking draw talking
[1:00:32] have marks about talking
[1:00:34] but accept this coming to the reality
[1:00:37] that it could be displayed if that's
[1:00:39] different
[1:00:45] you know
[1:00:46] you could watch somebody do something
[1:00:47] and say you're going to do it too and
[1:00:48] feel so miserable
[1:00:53] you know i see what a sabu um using a
[1:00:56] power soul
[1:00:57] and i watch
[1:00:59] and i feel like i'll do it too
[1:01:01] and i couldn't pull this i couldn't get
[1:01:02] string pull i couldn't get started i
[1:01:04] said but you know this is this is really
[1:01:06] something
[1:01:07] you can just watch and because you you
[1:01:10] you watch david
[1:01:11] you said looking for glad well that
[1:01:13] would beat you if you do have a
[1:01:15] revelation of the will of god for you to
[1:01:17] be on that battlefield then you can't do
[1:01:19] that
[1:01:20] you have to take behind a lion first
[1:01:22] so you can't jump over behind lion and
[1:01:24] say you're looking for golem
[1:01:26] you're looking to get
[1:01:27] damaged
[1:01:29] it doesn't work like that
[1:01:31] david knew he was in gorgeous
[1:01:34] they even knew that
[1:01:36] he knew he understood that on the back
[1:01:39] side there's it no pastor elder deaton
[1:01:41] usher
[1:01:42] um song leader no encouragement no teeth
[1:01:45] no recorder no no no no no nothing like
[1:01:47] that
[1:01:48] just him
[1:01:50] she god
[1:01:51] bear
[1:01:53] him
[1:01:54] sheep god lion
[1:01:56] and he knew and now i can sing song
[1:01:59] don't whip me i rather like stuff they
[1:02:02] comfort me yeah do i walk to man he knew
[1:02:05] god is with him
[1:02:08] he knew he's in god's will
[1:02:11] so when he came
[1:02:13] and relied i read his beef for almost 40
[1:02:16] days and 40 nights or whatever and when
[1:02:18] david about to leave because his brother
[1:02:20] is trying to humiliate him you know what
[1:02:21] people just do already then he say
[1:02:23] message you know what he's trying to
[1:02:24] make him feel small because he's not
[1:02:26] supposed to be wrong right
[1:02:28] so david said all right i'm going back
[1:02:30] to daddy i'm going back home
[1:02:32] when he heard glad he said who is the
[1:02:33] uncircumcised philistine he tagged him
[1:02:35] one time
[1:02:36] put a label on him
[1:02:38] he's uncircumcised he doesn't belong
[1:02:39] here
[1:02:40] because why the land
[1:02:42] belongs to the circumcised
[1:02:44] in other words even saying the land
[1:02:46] belongs to those who are the baptism of
[1:02:47] the holy ghost circumcision
[1:02:49] you get that
[1:02:51] the land belongs to the circumcised
[1:02:55] he is not supposed to be here
[1:02:57] so david know that's enemy one day
[1:03:00] okay so when they're looking for a man
[1:03:02] david sierra you know and give a
[1:03:03] testimony of what god did and saul was
[1:03:05] so desperate anybody except for he said
[1:03:08] he said go go go go do something yeah
[1:03:11] have a you have a somewhere
[1:03:13] david didn't just go in iran miguel
[1:03:16] he was in god's will
[1:03:18] and he borrowed if we only get started
[1:03:20] go do the rest so david god started with
[1:03:23] the sling began to swim he's saying god
[1:03:25] the spirit took a hold of his arm and
[1:03:27] directly stolen his spirit directed that
[1:03:29] stream
[1:03:31] but guess what if david didn't step over
[1:03:33] there that stone can go anywhere
[1:03:35] it still need a hand
[1:03:37] for god to use it still needs somebody
[1:03:39] that's surrendered to gods and this is
[1:03:41] where you have to see are you going to
[1:03:44] be that one
[1:03:45] not the pastor and the pastor of it or
[1:03:48] could pull you rather than the pastor
[1:03:49] over tonight
[1:03:53] you don't know
[1:03:56] i just seen this suppose this is my last
[1:03:57] service
[1:03:58] last exhortation
[1:04:00] to you
[1:04:04] and i'm challenging you
[1:04:06] to get to know
[1:04:07] the will of god what the will of god is
[1:04:10] for your life
[1:04:13] oh what time we are here now let's let's
[1:04:15] push on
[1:04:16] all right
[1:04:19] what about
[1:04:21] did not jesus say
[1:04:23] john 6 49
[1:04:25] your fathers did eat man in the
[1:04:26] wilderness and are dead
[1:04:30] those parents that died were necessary
[1:04:33] as the forefathers of the people told
[1:04:35] jesus was speaking
[1:04:36] did you get that
[1:04:38] so so let's let's
[1:04:41] let's take a view from god called god's
[1:04:43] eyes
[1:04:45] 400 years generation after generation
[1:04:46] crying out for deliverance in egypt
[1:04:49] jacob moses they come to response
[1:04:52] 2 million people coming out let's say
[1:04:54] tonight you get up and go stinking
[1:04:56] and you could see down the road now
[1:04:59] you could see
[1:05:01] these two million people not gonna make
[1:05:02] it
[1:05:04] you could see
[1:05:05] joshua and kayla
[1:05:07] but they don't know that yet you know
[1:05:08] coming out they're happy hallelujah
[1:05:11] but you could see 40 years ago 40 years
[1:05:13] down the road they're dying one by one
[1:05:17] because of unbelief
[1:05:20] you could see
[1:05:21] those parents having children in the
[1:05:23] wilderness under journey and god looking
[1:05:25] at the next generation
[1:05:28] to give glory and honor to him
[1:05:31] so these parents are necessary so all
[1:05:33] these two million people came up for one
[1:05:35] per person to make babies
[1:05:38] to produce
[1:05:39] the next generation
[1:05:41] that might sound blunt
[1:05:44] but that is the truth
[1:05:46] so when they say our father is my
[1:05:48] illness jesus
[1:05:54] your parent
[1:05:55] responsible for you here
[1:05:58] and you are the ones that caught a
[1:06:00] revelation of this malakai for perfect
[1:06:02] message
[1:06:04] now you have to go further than that to
[1:06:06] get into true preparation
[1:06:08] because of this very message
[1:06:11] what's the use if you know the exact
[1:06:13] date or what time jesus is coming here
[1:06:16] and everything else and you're not
[1:06:17] prepared
[1:06:19] and you could run and give people the
[1:06:21] information i know the date how many
[1:06:22] times i know the hour i know the year
[1:06:24] but you're not ready
[1:06:27] he explained who in the rapture
[1:06:30] he said this being not you
[1:06:33] this being
[1:06:34] when it's complete
[1:06:36] is the servant of god in the church of
[1:06:38] god going to rapture
[1:06:40] you can't miss the rapture if the magnet
[1:06:42] is inside of you you can't miss it
[1:06:44] because the magnet the big magnet
[1:06:46] command to pick up all those who are
[1:06:48] magnetizing it
[1:06:50] it's not you going the magnet going the
[1:06:52] power inside of you
[1:06:54] enoch mechanics became dynamics and god
[1:06:56] took him
[1:06:57] so the rapture going to be until nothing
[1:07:01] wow
[1:07:02] i trust you are 85 tonight all right so
[1:07:04] whatever
[1:07:06] do these elect
[1:07:10] okay let's back up a little bit
[1:07:12] so your father is a man in the
[1:07:13] wilderness and they're dead
[1:07:15] those parents that died was necessary as
[1:07:18] the forefathers of the people of jesus
[1:07:19] speaking
[1:07:20] they perished yet
[1:07:22] they were in the election of god
[1:07:24] naturally as joshua and killed the
[1:07:25] spiritual
[1:07:27] these elect were not only the eternal
[1:07:30] thoughts of god which were to be
[1:07:32] expressed in flesh in their due season
[1:07:35] but these same elect
[1:07:37] are called by another name
[1:07:39] romans 4 16 therefore it is a fate
[1:07:42] that it might be by grace
[1:07:45] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:07:47] all the seed
[1:07:48] not to that which is of the law
[1:07:51] but to that also which is of the fate of
[1:07:54] abraham who is the father of us all
[1:07:57] romans 9
[1:07:59] 7 the tree says neither because they are
[1:08:01] the seed of abraham
[1:08:03] are they all children but in isaac shall
[1:08:06] thy seed be called that is
[1:08:08] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:08:10] these are not the children of god
[1:08:13] but the children of the promised love
[1:08:15] that
[1:08:16] are counted for the seed for this is the
[1:08:19] word of promise at this time will i come
[1:08:22] and see ration of a son and not only
[1:08:24] this but when rebecca had also conceived
[1:08:27] by one even by our father isaac for the
[1:08:30] children may not yet born neither
[1:08:32] haven't done any good or evil that the
[1:08:34] purpose of god according to election
[1:08:36] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:08:38] call it it was said unto her the elder
[1:08:41] shall seal the younger that is written
[1:08:43] jacob have i love he so have i hated
[1:08:45] galatians 3 16 now the abraham and his
[1:08:48] seed would have promised me he said not
[1:08:50] and seeds but of many but as one and to
[1:08:54] thy seed which is christ galatians 3 29
[1:08:57] and if he be in christ
[1:08:59] then i abraham seed
[1:09:02] and ears according to the promise
[1:09:05] so watch according to romans 4 16 we
[1:09:08] find that god has given a short promise
[1:09:11] to all of abraham's seed
[1:09:14] and paul puts himself and all believers
[1:09:17] under that designation
[1:09:19] because he says abraham who is the
[1:09:21] father of us all
[1:09:23] then he goes on not only narrow down
[1:09:26] this definition but rather to finalize
[1:09:29] it for in galatians 3 he identified the
[1:09:32] seed singular with jesus
[1:09:34] and counted the seed children as
[1:09:37] children of promise
[1:09:39] and promise as having to do with
[1:09:41] election the chosen of god
[1:09:43] and that is exactly what we have been
[1:09:46] seeing
[1:09:47] these here we go who are of the royal
[1:09:50] seed are the elect of god
[1:09:52] are the predestinated
[1:09:55] fore known of god and when the mind of
[1:09:58] god and his toads
[1:10:00] in very plain language
[1:10:02] the true right of christ
[1:10:05] was in the mind of god eternally
[1:10:08] do not expressed until each came forth
[1:10:10] in its designated decree season
[1:10:13] as each member came forth
[1:10:16] it became expressed and took its place
[1:10:19] in the body thus
[1:10:21] this bride
[1:10:23] is the literal
[1:10:25] spoken word
[1:10:27] seed bride
[1:10:29] literal
[1:10:31] spoken word
[1:10:33] seed bride
[1:10:35] not man interpreted bride not explain
[1:10:38] away bride but spook what he says
[1:10:41] original seed
[1:10:42] spoken word
[1:10:44] in other words a word that came out of
[1:10:46] that prophet the spirit of god knew
[1:10:48] exactly every quote
[1:10:50] that he spoke to that prophet
[1:10:53] that is why we try to share the quotes
[1:10:55] the way we do
[1:10:56] because we knew it's original seed
[1:10:59] it's not i have a dream last night and
[1:11:00] explained something to you
[1:11:02] no
[1:11:03] it is dossier the law
[1:11:05] that's why i am not in could it be
[1:11:06] whatever it is the star last night
[1:11:08] another moon a comet come in this
[1:11:10] instant venus and mars answer i am no
[1:11:12] stargazer
[1:11:15] i'm not here to talk about venus and
[1:11:16] mars and you see i'm doing so
[1:11:21] trilateral
[1:11:22] and illuminati
[1:11:26] they might do anything you know
[1:11:28] that is their stuff
[1:11:30] but we have our stuff to do we doing our
[1:11:31] stuff tonight
[1:11:33] we want to know what is the will of god
[1:11:37] what the will of god is
[1:11:39] amen so let's continue here
[1:11:41] okay
[1:11:43] thus this bride
[1:11:45] is
[1:11:46] the literal spoken word she bride
[1:11:49] and though she is feminine in
[1:11:51] designation she is also called the body
[1:11:53] of christ
[1:11:54] it is apparent that she ought to be
[1:11:56] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:11:59] him
[1:12:00] came from the same source was eternal
[1:12:02] with him and is now manifesting god
[1:12:05] manifesting god in a many-membered body
[1:12:09] there was christ was god was manifested
[1:12:11] in one member in the lord jesus christ
[1:12:15] okay here we go
[1:12:16] coming to the conclusion as eternal
[1:12:18] logos god
[1:12:19] was manifest in the sun
[1:12:21] and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:12:23] the goddess bodily and that eternal one
[1:12:26] was the father manifest in the flesh
[1:12:28] and thereby gain the title of son even
[1:12:31] so we he took him in his thoughts in our
[1:12:34] turn became the many members spoken with
[1:12:36] seed
[1:12:38] manifested in the flesh
[1:12:40] and those eternal torts now manifest in
[1:12:42] the flesh are the sons of god
[1:12:45] even as we are so called
[1:12:47] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[1:12:50] we were seed and therefore were born
[1:12:54] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:12:57] because we were seed
[1:12:59] and there is a reason we could be
[1:13:00] quickened
[1:13:01] in non-seed
[1:13:03] there is nothing to quicken
[1:13:05] so let's say the home structure now
[1:13:08] the ten commandments
[1:13:10] the ten commandments the first four is
[1:13:12] our attitude towards god
[1:13:14] the next six
[1:13:16] is our attitude towards your neighbor
[1:13:20] first commandment i'm the lord thy god
[1:13:21] thou shall have no strange god before me
[1:13:23] thou shalt not keep the lord even the
[1:13:24] lord i call in vain remember to keep the
[1:13:27] sabbath holy honor thy father my mother
[1:13:29] said those shall not kill those shall
[1:13:31] not commit adultery don't try not to
[1:13:32] steal those times witness against thy
[1:13:35] neighbor don't shall recover their
[1:13:36] neighbor's wife
[1:13:38] those shall not cover their neighbors
[1:13:41] so on this home stretch now i really
[1:13:43] want to get to ephesians
[1:13:45] to view it a little different tonight
[1:13:47] though we always said an ephesians
[1:13:48] division is the book that i love
[1:13:50] it's a team that i love
[1:13:52] and um the adventure we had last was all
[1:13:54] about ephesians but tonight
[1:13:57] i want to look at divisions in two parts
[1:14:01] the first part
[1:14:03] is revelation
[1:14:05] doctrine
[1:14:06] teaching
[1:14:08] teaching part
[1:14:09] and the second part is doing applying
[1:14:12] the actin part
[1:14:14] all right
[1:14:15] so i believe that i will say it like
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:18] ephesians one to three
[1:14:21] chapters is revelation
[1:14:24] doctrine teaching
[1:14:25] chapter four is like a transitional and
[1:14:28] to be doing application and then you get
[1:14:30] five and six six chapters in the book of
[1:14:32] ephesians
[1:14:34] so quickly if you have your bibles or
[1:14:35] you can just listen i just want to run
[1:14:37] through touch highlights are we gonna
[1:14:39] close off
[1:14:40] with the whole thing like tonight
[1:14:43] ephesians 1 blessed be the god and
[1:14:44] father of our lord jesus christ would
[1:14:46] bless us with all spiritual blessings
[1:14:48] in heaven and places in christ
[1:14:50] according as he has chosen him before
[1:14:52] the foundation of the world so this is
[1:14:53] revelation this is teaching this is
[1:14:55] unfolding mysteries that we should be
[1:14:57] holy with all blame with all reforming
[1:14:59] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:15:01] abduction of children by jesus christ to
[1:15:03] himself according to good pleasure of
[1:15:05] his will this is revelation this is
[1:15:07] mysteries this is the word unfolded that
[1:15:09] the praise of the glory of his of his
[1:15:11] grace
[1:15:12] wherein he has made us accepted beloved
[1:15:15] in whom we have redemption to his blood
[1:15:17] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:15:18] riches of his grace
[1:15:20] wherein he has made known unto us having
[1:15:23] made known to us the mystery of his will
[1:15:25] according to his good pleasure which had
[1:15:27] put us in himself
[1:15:29] in whom he also trusted
[1:15:31] after you heard the word of truth the
[1:15:33] gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:15:36] also after you believe you were sealed
[1:15:39] with that holy spirit of promise which
[1:15:42] is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:15:44] until the redemption of the butcher's
[1:15:46] possession and the degrees of his glory
[1:15:48] so hearing this is like revelation
[1:15:51] unfolding of the mystery of god
[1:15:53] right chapter two
[1:15:55] just in snippets of it and you are the
[1:15:57] equipment who was dead in trespassing
[1:15:59] sins
[1:16:00] wherein time passed you walk according
[1:16:02] to the course of this world according to
[1:16:04] the prince of the power of the ear the
[1:16:06] spirit that now wicked to the chair of
[1:16:08] disobedience among whom also we had our
[1:16:10] conversation or life in times past in
[1:16:13] the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:16:15] desires of the flesh of the mind and
[1:16:17] what by nature the children of
[1:16:19] even as others but god was rich and
[1:16:21] mercy for his great love where he loved
[1:16:23] us for by grace are you saved to feed
[1:16:25] and that not ourselves is a gift of god
[1:16:27] not of works he's mentioned books so
[1:16:29] it's clarifying our position clarifying
[1:16:31] where we come from clarifying that god
[1:16:33] rich and mercy come and his love towards
[1:16:35] us and so on and verse 10 we are his
[1:16:38] workmanship created in christ jesus unto
[1:16:40] good works which god had before ordained
[1:16:43] that we should walk in them and through
[1:16:45] him we have both accessed by one spirit
[1:16:48] under the father now therefore here we
[1:16:50] go we are no more strangers and
[1:16:52] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:16:54] saints of the household of god and are
[1:16:57] built upon the foundation of the
[1:16:58] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:17:00] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:17:02] chapter three
[1:17:04] so we don't switch all of that already
[1:17:06] and like snip it from chapter three for
[1:17:08] this course i paul a prisoner of jesus
[1:17:10] christ for you gentiles
[1:17:11] and paul begin to speak
[1:17:13] whereby when you read you may understand
[1:17:15] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[1:17:18] which is other ages was not made known
[1:17:19] to the sons of men and there is no
[1:17:21] reveal onto his holy apostles and
[1:17:23] prophets by the spirit
[1:17:24] you bring in a revelation here now that
[1:17:26] the gentiles should be followers of the
[1:17:28] same body and partakers of his promise
[1:17:30] in christ by the gospel that he will
[1:17:32] grant you his prayer in verse 16
[1:17:35] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:17:37] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:17:39] in the inner man that christ may dwell
[1:17:41] in your hearts by faith that he being
[1:17:43] written and grumbling in love may be
[1:17:45] able to comprehend with all sins what is
[1:17:47] the bread
[1:17:48] length depth height
[1:17:50] praise god and to know the love of
[1:17:53] christ which passive knowledge the love
[1:17:55] of christ passes what knowledge
[1:17:57] that you might be filled
[1:17:58] with the fullness of god now we go to
[1:18:00] chapter four
[1:18:01] and i call this a transition chapter
[1:18:03] from revelation into action it starts
[1:18:05] off with one idea for the prisoner of
[1:18:07] the lord beseech you thank you that you
[1:18:09] walk worthy of glorification versus your
[1:18:12] call
[1:18:13] so you begin to bring in
[1:18:15] not just revelation
[1:18:17] or the following of the word
[1:18:19] he's beginning to address behavior
[1:18:22] are you getting me saints
[1:18:24] just like in ten commandments the first
[1:18:26] part dog shall have another course
[1:18:28] before me and then don't commit to me by
[1:18:30] wife comment before good in other words
[1:18:32] getting into the behavior
[1:18:34] the action the doing part so i just want
[1:18:37] to reflect on that here now so paul
[1:18:41] begins to talk about being worthy of the
[1:18:43] vocation where we are called these are
[1:18:44] called people here now i'm talking about
[1:18:46] all loneliness and weakness listen to
[1:18:48] description
[1:18:50] so all the mysteries unfold you bring in
[1:18:52] revelation that we are partakers of the
[1:18:54] same body the gentiles the jews we bring
[1:18:56] in all the mysteries we are predestined
[1:18:58] to abortion breathe out the holy spirit
[1:18:59] we are sealed and then four he begins
[1:19:02] with all loneliness and meekness with
[1:19:04] long suffering forbearing one another in
[1:19:06] love and care endeavoring to keep the
[1:19:09] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:19:11] there is one calling
[1:19:13] one spirit this is mystery one and even
[1:19:15] you're calling one
[1:19:16] hope of your calling one lord one feet
[1:19:19] one baptism one god and father of all
[1:19:22] who's above or two and only every one of
[1:19:24] us is giving grace according to the
[1:19:26] measure of the gift of christ and he
[1:19:27] gives some apostles not one man of all
[1:19:30] can i say they give not one man of all i
[1:19:32] mean the man claimed that having all
[1:19:34] these gifts liars he gives some apostles
[1:19:38] some prophets some evangelists some
[1:19:41] pastors and teachers what for for the
[1:19:44] refine of the saints or the work of the
[1:19:46] ministry for the eddy fine of the body
[1:19:48] of christ do we all come in the unit of
[1:19:50] the fate love of the son of god onto a
[1:19:53] perfect man
[1:19:54] unto the measure of the statue of the
[1:19:56] fullness of christ that we henceforth be
[1:19:58] no more children that's the object
[1:20:00] torched to and through and carried a
[1:20:02] boat with never been abducted by the
[1:20:04] slay of men and contractedness and where
[1:20:06] they are they're very lying wait to
[1:20:08] deceive
[1:20:10] but speaking the truth in love they grow
[1:20:12] up into him and all things which is
[1:20:14] ahead in christ among the whole body fit
[1:20:17] the joint together and compact it like
[1:20:19] that which every joint is applied
[1:20:21] according to the effectual working in
[1:20:23] the measure of every part make an
[1:20:25] increase of the body onto the infinitive
[1:20:27] servant love
[1:20:28] then paul vernon said
[1:20:30] verse 22 that you put off considering
[1:20:32] the former conversation the old man
[1:20:35] which is corrupt according to the sea
[1:20:37] for lust
[1:20:38] so paul now is addressing issues with
[1:20:41] addressing behavior is addressing the
[1:20:43] conduct of people in the church what to
[1:20:46] address in their lives is no longer
[1:20:48] talking about predestination and the
[1:20:50] mystery and then you see us in the
[1:20:52] battery book no no paul
[1:20:54] give back and unfold all of that and now
[1:20:56] he's addressing
[1:21:00] things in people's lives so who's 22 and
[1:21:02] the amplified says
[1:21:03] strip yourself of your former nature
[1:21:07] and put off
[1:21:08] and discard
[1:21:10] your old unrenewed self which
[1:21:14] characterize your previous manner of
[1:21:17] life
[1:21:18] and because becomes corrupt to lust and
[1:21:21] desires that spring from delusion
[1:21:24] verse 22 says and be renewed in the
[1:21:27] spirit
[1:21:29] of your mind
[1:21:30] and the amplified it says here and be
[1:21:32] constantly renewed
[1:21:34] in the spirit of your mind having a
[1:21:37] fresh mental and spiritual attitude
[1:21:41] so let's go back now that you put on the
[1:21:43] new man
[1:21:44] which after god
[1:21:45] is created in righteousness
[1:21:48] and true holiness
[1:21:50] wherefore putting away a lion
[1:21:52] speak
[1:21:53] every man truth with his neighbor that
[1:21:57] we are members one of another
[1:22:00] so it says here okay
[1:22:02] be not be
[1:22:03] angry and sinner
[1:22:05] let not the son go down on your right
[1:22:08] neither give praise to the devil or that
[1:22:10] is given no room or foothold or
[1:22:12] opportunity to do
[1:22:14] talking about believers now that him
[1:22:16] that stole steal no more we're talking
[1:22:18] about church folks okay
[1:22:20] substitute
[1:22:23] let his teeth steal no more but rather
[1:22:25] let him be industrious make him honest
[1:22:28] he said let it i'd rather let him labor
[1:22:29] working with his hands that thing which
[1:22:31] is good that he may give to him that
[1:22:33] needed
[1:22:34] let no corrupt
[1:22:36] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:22:38] but that which is good to the use of
[1:22:41] defined that it may minister grace to
[1:22:43] the hearers and the amplifier i said let
[1:22:45] no fall or polluted language
[1:22:48] nor evil would no unwholesome or
[1:22:50] worthless talk come out of your mouth
[1:22:52] but only such speech as is good and
[1:22:55] beneficial to the spiritual progress of
[1:22:57] others as it is fit into the need until
[1:23:00] the occasion that it may be a blessing
[1:23:03] and give grace and god's fever to those
[1:23:05] who hear it and grieve not the holy
[1:23:07] spirit but you are sealed until their
[1:23:10] redemption and let all bitterness and
[1:23:13] wrath and anger and claim and evil speak
[1:23:15] and be put away from you
[1:23:17] with all malice and be kind one to
[1:23:20] another
[1:23:21] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:23:23] as god for christ's sake and forgiving
[1:23:25] you so after all the mystery talk on the
[1:23:27] mystery of evaluation and inspiration
[1:23:29] these things is what paul addressing he
[1:23:31] says let all business be amplified
[1:23:33] indignation and wrath passion rage bad
[1:23:35] temper resentment anger animosity
[1:23:38] quarreling brawling clamour contention
[1:23:41] slander evil speaking abusive and
[1:23:44] blasphemous language be banished from
[1:23:46] you we all malice which is fight illegal
[1:23:49] pieces of any kind and become useful
[1:23:53] helpful
[1:23:54] kind to one another
[1:23:56] tenderhearted
[1:23:58] compassionate
[1:23:59] understanding
[1:24:01] loving hearted
[1:24:02] forgiving one another
[1:24:04] readily freely as god for christ given
[1:24:07] you
[1:24:08] all right so we go to ephesians 5.
[1:24:10] you're muslim
[1:24:12] then paul said be therefore followers of
[1:24:14] god their children and walk in love as
[1:24:16] christ
[1:24:18] has given himself as an offering a sweet
[1:24:20] smell and server but fornication and all
[1:24:23] uncleanness of consciousness let it not
[1:24:25] be named among you has
[1:24:28] become its sin amplified
[1:24:30] but immorality
[1:24:32] sexual advice and all impurity of
[1:24:34] lustful rich wasteful living or
[1:24:37] greediness must not even be named among
[1:24:39] you as it is fitting and proper among
[1:24:42] saints courts consecrated people
[1:24:45] neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[1:24:47] no justin which are not convenient but
[1:24:49] rather give enough time
[1:24:51] for this you know that no more manga nor
[1:24:54] unclean person nor conscious man who is
[1:24:56] an idolater she had an inheritance in
[1:24:58] the kingdom of god
[1:25:00] let no man deceive you with these vain
[1:25:02] words for because of these things commit
[1:25:05] the right of god upon the church of
[1:25:07] disobedience the amplified said let
[1:25:09] there be no filthiness obscenity
[1:25:11] indecency no foolish and sinful city
[1:25:14] corrupt talk no course chest which are
[1:25:17] not fitting or becoming but instead
[1:25:20] voice your confidence to god but be sure
[1:25:22] of this that no person practicing sexual
[1:25:25] advice or impurity in thought or in life
[1:25:27] or one who is covetous who has lustful
[1:25:30] desire for the property of others
[1:25:33] and is greedy for gain for he is in
[1:25:35] effect is an idolater has any
[1:25:38] inheritance in the kingdom of christ
[1:25:41] let no one delete to delude and receive
[1:25:43] you with empty excuses groundless
[1:25:46] arguments but these sins for true these
[1:25:49] things come to wrath of god
[1:25:52] upon those sons of rebellion
[1:25:53] disobedience do not associate or be
[1:25:56] sharers with them for once you are away
[1:25:58] in darkness but now you are the light of
[1:26:01] the lord walk us through the light
[1:26:03] all right
[1:26:04] so then come down to the scripture help
[1:26:06] me put the text on
[1:26:08] ephesians 5 it says see then that you
[1:26:10] walk circumspectly
[1:26:12] not as fools
[1:26:13] redeeming the time
[1:26:15] because the days are evil
[1:26:17] wherefore
[1:26:19] be not unwise but understanding what the
[1:26:22] will of the lord is and the amplified he
[1:26:25] said look carefully then how you walk
[1:26:28] live purposefully and worthily and
[1:26:31] accurately not as unwise and witness but
[1:26:34] as wise sensible intelligent people
[1:26:37] making the very most of the time
[1:26:39] and i like this buying of each
[1:26:41] opportunity
[1:26:42] because
[1:26:43] the days are evil therefore do not be
[1:26:45] vague and thoughtless foolish
[1:26:48] but understanding and fully grasping
[1:26:51] what the will of the lord is
[1:26:53] oh my
[1:26:54] and it says speaking to yourselves in
[1:26:55] psalms hymns spiritual songs giving
[1:26:58] thanks for the lord submitting
[1:26:59] yourselves one to another and a few of
[1:27:01] god wives submit yourselves your own
[1:27:03] husbands
[1:27:04] chapter six
[1:27:06] children will be your parents so all of
[1:27:08] this is application
[1:27:09] right and the law for it is right
[1:27:11] honor thy father my mother which is the
[1:27:13] first commandment would promise that it
[1:27:15] may be well with thee that all
[1:27:17] long on the earth and the father has
[1:27:19] provoked not your children to right but
[1:27:21] bring them in the nurture and the
[1:27:23] admission of the lord finally my
[1:27:25] brethren this is the final be strong in
[1:27:28] the lord
[1:27:29] and the power is might put on the whole
[1:27:31] armor of god that you may be able to
[1:27:33] stand against the wise of the devil for
[1:27:35] harassment against flesh and blood but
[1:27:37] against principalities and powers
[1:27:39] against the ruler of darkness of this
[1:27:41] world against spiritual weakness
[1:27:43] in high places wherefore take unto you
[1:27:45] the whole armor of god that you may be
[1:27:47] able to withstand in the evil day having
[1:27:49] an all to stand stand therefore having
[1:27:51] your law is good about the truth having
[1:27:53] known the breast spirit of righteousness
[1:27:55] your feet shared with the preparation of
[1:27:56] the gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:27:59] shield of faith where it shall be able
[1:28:01] to quench all the fiery deaths of the
[1:28:02] wicked and take the helmet of salvation
[1:28:05] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:28:06] word of god
[1:28:07] and i'm closing with this this scripture
[1:28:09] the last scripture you will read is some
[1:28:11] genes
[1:28:13] and james 1
[1:28:16] from verse 19 says wherefore my beloved
[1:28:19] let every man be swift to hear
[1:28:22] slow to speak
[1:28:24] slow to wrath
[1:28:26] for the right of man we could not be
[1:28:28] righteousness of god
[1:28:30] wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[1:28:33] superfluity of naughtiness
[1:28:35] and receive with meekness
[1:28:37] being drafted word which is able to save
[1:28:40] your souls but be doers of the word
[1:28:44] not hearers only
[1:28:46] deceive in your own selves
[1:28:48] but if any be a hearer of the word or
[1:28:51] not a doer
[1:28:52] he's like our man be holding his natural
[1:28:54] face in the glass for he behold himself
[1:28:57] great is we and strictly forgetted what
[1:28:59] manner of man he was
[1:29:01] but who so looked into the perfect law
[1:29:03] of liberty and continued therein and he
[1:29:06] being not a forgetful hero but the doer
[1:29:08] of the work
[1:29:09] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[1:29:11] if any man among you seem to be
[1:29:13] religious
[1:29:14] and bright or not his tongue but
[1:29:16] deceiving his own heart
[1:29:18] this man religion
[1:29:20] is in vain
[1:29:21] pure religion and undefiled before god
[1:29:24] and the father is this
[1:29:26] to visit the fatherless and the widows
[1:29:29] in the affliction
[1:29:30] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[1:29:31] world
[1:29:32] i'm going to read his name amplified are
[1:29:34] we going to close
[1:29:37] understand this my beloved brethren
[1:29:39] every man be quick to hear
[1:29:41] a ready listener
[1:29:42] so to speak
[1:29:44] slowly take offense and they get angry
[1:29:47] for man's anger does not promote the
[1:29:49] righteousness god wishes and requires
[1:29:53] so get rid of all uncleanness
[1:29:56] and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness
[1:29:58] now listen this is too much folks he's
[1:30:00] talking about here
[1:30:02] they're not sinners and people outside
[1:30:04] this is true folks so get rid of all
[1:30:06] uncleanness
[1:30:07] and the rampant or growth of wickedness
[1:30:10] and in a humble gentle modest spirit
[1:30:14] receive and welcome the word which
[1:30:16] implanted
[1:30:18] and rooted in your hearts contain the
[1:30:20] power to save your souls
[1:30:22] but be doers of the word
[1:30:24] will be the message
[1:30:25] not merely listens to it betraying
[1:30:28] yourself into a deception
[1:30:30] by reasoning contrary to the truth
[1:30:33] but if anyone who only listens to the
[1:30:35] word without obeying it and being a do
[1:30:38] of it he is like a man who looks
[1:30:40] carefully at his own natural face in the
[1:30:42] mirror for he thoughtfully observes
[1:30:44] himself and then goes off and promptly
[1:30:45] forget what he was like oh my
[1:30:49] so jesus even compare it to a man who
[1:30:51] hear my words
[1:30:53] do with them is a man who bill is house
[1:30:55] upon a rock and then the rains came
[1:30:58] the other person built this house upon
[1:30:59] the sand
[1:31:01] am i standing for 20 years because it
[1:31:02] rains i come
[1:31:04] when the rains come it will show what we
[1:31:07] are standing on
[1:31:08] so i want to encourage you tonight to
[1:31:10] seek the lord
[1:31:11] seek the will of god for your life
[1:31:13] when you recognize you're walking in the
[1:31:15] will of god then you know everything's
[1:31:17] going to be fine let's borrow it

[1:31:28] real to your people tonight
[1:31:30] that they could walk circumspect but i
[1:31:32] was shared with them
[1:31:34] hold their book of ephesians we could
[1:31:36] divide it into two parts lord
[1:31:38] the part of revelation the unfolding of
[1:31:40] the word they're full of the mysteries
[1:31:42] and the part where we have instructions
[1:31:45] what to do husband love your wives
[1:31:47] wives reference your husband children
[1:31:50] will be a parent
[1:31:51] and how to walk in all loneliness
[1:31:53] and meekness
[1:31:54] and so on
[1:31:56] and further
[1:31:57] it has so much debate and argument over
[1:32:00] text quotes scriptures and so on
[1:32:02] and there are things to apply

[1:32:15] heart to listen closely
