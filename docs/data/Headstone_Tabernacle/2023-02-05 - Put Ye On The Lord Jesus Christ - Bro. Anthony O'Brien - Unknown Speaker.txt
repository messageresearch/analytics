me and uh as well as as I suppose many others pretty much inspired by that word and uh while he was speaking something turned into my heart and because I was downstairs with my son he might have just watching over him and and listen listen to the message something just spoke to my heart praise God so that's what I have amen praise God this morning amen so just kind of staying in an atmosphere now and let's go over to the wound um Romans chapter 13 we have three portion of scriptures here we want to read from and um Romans 13 we also want to read from second Corinthians 10. and Ephesians 6. amen for scripture reading uh a man so praise God so Romans 13. and reading from verse 11 it says and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is fast spent the day is at hand amen what day this day amen you shall know that I'm the father you and me right see so let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering unwantedness not in strife and envying but putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen also uh Second Corinthians 10. um and you want to read from verse 4. we read um we read four and five okay second Corinthians 10 from those four says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen in Ephesians 6 and verse 10 or last reading here familiar scripture of God right says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle knocked against flesh and blood but against principalities against pounds against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the bless the breastplate of righteousness and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace and Paul says here above all taken the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all of the fiery dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God may God have blessing to the Ring of his word let's bow our hands almighty God we thank you for your word this morning and Lord we thank you for your presence here Among Us Lord father that we feel now we pray now their Godfathers we get ready to turn our attention towards the scriptures and the word of God for today I pray that God it

answer me like a man if you know what the truth is if you know that a prophet's spoken to you all these years then answer me like a man this morning where was thou when I lay the foundation of the church and the morning staff sung together and the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you where Hallelujah where will you pray where does your Revelation take you does it take you before the beginning does it take you before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule do you know who you are this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah put on your spiritual thinking caps

comments come to Big War With the Enemy beat your black sheds into swords and use them against the enemy come on come on oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it this morning glory hallelujah oh Hallelujah so spiritual warfare that's what we're in now praise God I love what shared with us last Sunday a great expose of modern events being made clear by Vindicated prophecy of Vindicated Prophet spoke praise God our vision and now the world is almost like fighting towards fulfilling that Vision with science and technology they are racing towards it with every step they take tomorrow they're going to have more advanced technology than they had five minutes ago praise that's how fast it's moving and if the world is moving so fast then brother we've got to move fast too the Bible says we're not a vision the people perish so it took on Malachi for profits to present us with a vision a vision of what we are to achieve what we are to be all and what we supposed to conquer what we're supposed to overcome what we supposed to possess adoption Perfection he presented a vision and he that reason it must run oh hallelujah oh so we're here to read it this morning we had a run without Vision hold on chilling manifest until it come to pass amen glory to God spiritual warfare Supernatural and the Bible says the weapons of our Warfare are not Connor but they are spiritual praise God so this is not a natural thing we come into this church but that sometimes I feel we come too natural we come to Kana we come in here like he said like a power you're coming too or some kind of shop or there's your friend house no it's not your friend house this is Court's house this is a mighty Throne elevation hallelujah oh who can stand before him before Mighty God or we are ashamed the nakedness hallelujah oh Hallelujah we want to clothe ourselves we want to dress rights we want to rock white we want to talk right we want to have the right approach to God stop your natural stop being carnal stop following around in your flesh listen to a command this morning a trumpet is going out the weapons of our Warfare they are spiritual this morning put on the Lord Jesus Christ somebody say Amen somebody say Amen get a lot of Shadow prayer Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah oh this is not a natural message this is a supernatural message imagine God in his Dimension Supernatural Dimension listen if you hear Angelic language or Heavenly language you don't know what that is you never heard that before you don't know what they're saying all you know is the Heavenly language is an unearthly language it's a supernatural thing also God had to find a way to speak to you this morning God had to find a conduit something he could use somebody he could put his hand on to get a message to you to interpret it correctly so that you can catch the real true message what God is trying to tell us and there is a message this morning a message to get us out of here a message of Escape Angel come down from heaven oh hallelujah hallelujah and he swore by him not never forever and ever and when he cried 7 foreign that message is for you this morning to show you how to escape oh to escape the Judgment just keep the tribulation that message came to a prophet and that Prophet didn't hold back he didn't keep it for himself he screamed that message out there's a little comfort of pride in the last days she will have to say the Lord God told his Prophet pick up his pen on the rights oh the word isn't the bride oh Hallelujah super Church super race that's who you are this morning oh can we praise him oh Hallelujah oh so forgive me if I get a little bit excited forgive me if I scream forgive me if I cry a little bit forgive me if I shout a little bit forgive me if I'm happy but I'm rejoicing because I heard a message that come from a supernatural place come from a supernatural atmosphere it comes on into this urge and it found you it found me it's gonna find your loved ones it's gonna find a black sliders it's gonna find all who are far off the fire of the Holy Ghost is getting ready to sweep over the Earth and coldly left by fire by fire by fire Hallelujah blurry.com you're gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost make no mistake who we fully recall who we call it justify he had already glorified give Lord a shot of prey Hallelujah [Applause] I feel cold oh oh it's coming it's coming it's colored Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah hey many men oh this is your day you like David this morning you see they are coming on the road time to dance brother time to shout your feeling is coming your ceiling is coming You Can Dance whole service that's all right you and the spirit that's where you belong this is where you belong in the spirit worshiping worshiping thank you worship precedes the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire Keep worshiping this morning pull it down Hallelujah Glory haven't done a message release to give you faith to call for the power to turn you from what you are into this and then that spiritual being when that is complete is a servant of God that goes into the Rapture oh that's a message everything else fill the material a little bit here a little bit there but this is the main thing amen let's keep the main thing the main thing praise God not just a message but to become the message to get magnetized Amen to that Holy Spirit all right foreign [Applause] I actually haven't started [Applause] but anyway wonderful well this message is a supernatural message and they come to us in these last days by a prophet completely Supernatural right the Bible itself is a supernatural book the words of this book are Supernatural see we got used to seeing things we got habituated into church who went to life we get used to seeing it but where did Israeli come from astrologers scientists great wise man different ones that study the Bible find all kind of amazing things about it but that's just in the natural there's a supernatural encoding that unlocks this book it only comes by divine revelation and God revealed himself to whomsoever he will and this morning he bypass dictatories he bypassed potentiates he bypass high on men so-called men of the cloth he bypassed them and came to us humble people we don't look like much but God is with us he's with you by his word he said I'll never leave you I never forsake you under the world no longer see me you're gonna see me but I'll be with you even in you praise God yeah Hallelujah oh oh Hallelujah amen no it's not right Supernatural Saint John 6 and verse 63 it is a spirit that quickened the flesh Prophet had nothing I believe we spoke on this Wednesday right the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive that's the words of this book Hallelujah this guy says the word but one day it's going to turn back to Spirit again because God's gonna turn the light on and prove what is word and what is not word what's called and the devil praise God prove the difference between the true unadulterated word of God and bans interpretation all these years God's Gonna prove it by fire he's going to prove it by gasoline he's gonna put my light in the match praise God and you're gonna see her where it's really at so all duty is to stay with this word hallelujah because of Flesh profit and nothing but Jesus said the words that I speak to you they are spirits and it's a spirit of quickness so if you stay with the word God's Gonna Quicken that same word and make it spirits and make it anointed in your life Hallelujah in your walk in your talk Hallelujah and Wednesday night we're about over his preaching pretty talking about the oil spirit I remember studying that uh in the mess in the Hebrew the word Messiah actually means oil it actually means an anointing Hallelujah Messiah actually means oil you have to have the oil the oil in order to identify messiah in order to identify anointing in order to identify what God is doing what God has his hand on oh hello when God wanted to call a king he told Samuel go down to the house of Jesse and anoint one of his sons he didn't tell him who he just had to wait for a witness of the spirits God told Samuel don't look at Heights don't look at stature don't look at pills don't look at face don't look at skin color no no no this is not a flesh thing this is a supernatural thing you go in my Supernatural order spiritual instructions come to Samuel oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right Samuel come down to the house everybody in fear because when our prophets show up that's not disturbing thing Prophet stop all plagues and wars and judgments are the Lord when Samuel said don't worry behold I come in peace I come by the self-service let's set up something here now and let all the family come together praise God Amen God's getting ready to do a thing and everybody come in obedience praise God hallelujah said praise God but one by one when he checked the sons no witness no witness no witness you check all these sons look wrong yes he no witness he said is there any more do you have any more because I didn't come here for nothing I didn't come here just to show my face I come here with some oil and somebody gotta get it until this morning I feel the angel of God is here with some oil and he ain't going back until he do what he was told to do so are you ready this morning are you ready this morning for your oil oh oh Hallelujah the horn is full who wants it who's desperate who's crying the Bible said blessed are there first after righteousness but it shall be filled if you want the oil you can have it this morning if you need the Holy Ghost you could have it this morning you have not because it has Notch ask ye for rain in a time of rain or the time of rain is coming the time of rain is here you better put on the Lord Jesus Christ put on your garment [Applause] [Music] okay oh he don't talk over now he's at the wheel ah when God told Moses about the Passover told him he said get ready because I'm gonna pass through Egypt last night praise God I'm gonna take out the firstborn of every house every house except those that have the token displayed on the on the mantle of the doorpost and so forth isn't that right it's not right and what did God tell uh Moses tell the people to do just uh the the sacrifice and the rose in the lamb flesh and so forth eating a little bit of herbs but he also told him he said put your shoes on your feet put your comments on have your staff in your hand because you're getting ready to leave here in other words put on something while you're getting ready while you're playing a token while you're in desperation while you're in prayer put on something put on your shoes put on your clothes we getting ready to leave here don't leave nothing back don't leave nothing behind not one shall let people be left behind the Good Shepherd is going after that one he done left the 99 pretty in the fall but he's going after that one this morning maybe you my Christian brother maybe you my Christian friend maybe you my sister that is going after this morning he's knocking at your door open up the door this morning he's crying out the door if any man says if any about open up the door I'll come into him and I'll manifest myself to him God wants to manifest himself to you God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost God's heart is so burning to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it but you gotta get a part of the natural get up into the spirit thank you oh no no wow hey man we in the spirit now hey man this wood comes from God this word that we're hearing this morning comes from God it is his Divine message to us and we ought to treat it so and not in a carnal atmosphere but Francis if I could get more in the monitors please not in a carnal atmosphere but in a spiritual atmosphere so I'll approach or to be one of sincerity recognizing that there's a holy God in this place this morning and wants to touch you to bless you if you can open your eyes like Elijah's servant to see what's really happening around you to see that you are accompanied by angels that you are not alone in this battle he says stand still and see the salvation of your car here I believe it shall not make haste but we are resting on the promised word of God what he said what he said cannot fall to the crown it shall accomplish it shall accomplish because it is not man's words it is God's words oh even the devil knows that God's word must be accomplished but he fights against it he fights against you believe in it because he doesn't want you to change he doesn't want you to be filled to be sealed because if that happens he has no more hold on your life yeah no more hole on your heart because they kick out demons they kick out the lust you kick out the pride the envy you kick out the no praise demons you kick out Orcs And grudges or has something happened to you Spirit of

fighting is every minute fighting is every hour fighting I believe it was a Wednesday night I was preaching and you just come to me that I was looking at it I look Paul even said in Ephesians 6 above all take the shield of fate and I think it was the Spartans who they revered they respected they appreciated their Shield so much it meant so much to them until the Spartan mothers would tell their sons come back home with your shield on your hand or if you come back Dead come back lying down on your Shield but by all means come back with your Shield that's how much they respected it that's how much they appreciated it because with your Shield you could quench the fiery thoughts of the wicked the devil has come with fiery darts say they can't make it you can't overcome your sin too much you can't receive the Holy Ghost you can't pray you can't call on God but if you have your Shield of Faith you could quench those fiery thoughts when they come Hallelujah I know my court is a deliverer I know my God Is A Healer I know my God is a Waymaker oh Hallelujah you could quench the fiery dots and that Shield is so powerful you cannot over cover yourself where you can cover the brother to the left of you you can cover the brother to your right to you your feet your sheer can stand in a gap for somebody this morning who's too weak so if you're in the battle and your brother's bleeding out

amen praise God all right Psalms 139 verse 6. David said such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high talking about spiritual things right I cannot attain unto it he said where shall I go from thy spirit are you talking about the spirit yes oh winner shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there and if I make my bed in hell some of us may call bed in hell sometimes with the decisions that we make but David said even if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall I hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me he's holding you this morning you're not holding on to him you might be holding on to him now but he was always holding on to you he had his hand on you he laid he laid since the foundation of the world he laid his hand on you and though the devil tried to pull you this way or not he always had his hand on you in your trial in your tests when it felt like old man turned their back on you when it felt like you were being persecuted hated Without a Cause he still had his hand on you even though they mistreat you speak evil on you for their party's evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified because he has his hand on you this morning he said I'll never leave you said I'll never forsake you I'll always be with you to the trial to the fall in the dark places when you cry at night and nobody knows your pain nobody knows your sorrow when you don't understand you can still raise your hand and say Jesus you know better than I you know better than I and I take your will I tear my will down oh and I accept your will for my life I don't understand all the pieces but he's still working on me this morning can I get a witness this morning does somebody know that he's still working on them working on your situation working on your trial that wayward son is not too far that God cannot release his Arrow of Deliverance this morning and deliver that we were daughter whoever it is you have in your heart this morning keep praying keep praying keep praying keep praying he's not finished yet he's not over yet [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah be encouraged weep and may enjoy for a night but but joy cometh in the morning the night is not forever the night is fast pants but there's a morning coming a Morning Coming For You A Morning has joy in it a Morning has a newness of life you're gonna receive your reward for the faith that you have in God because it was your faith that was being tried even though your feelings fell to the ground even though your human Spirit was stripped and beaten God put something in your soul this morning that's the only reason you came here this morning is because God put something in your soul that something is eternal that something cannot fall to the ground the secret is the word is in the bride that word is in you this morning and the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the oil it's kind of ready to be released to bring that word to pass oh believe it this morning [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] oh my God David said I'm crazy if I am faithfully and wonderfully made works and that my soul know as well God wanted to get a message something you wanted to see somebody want to get to us like but it always says God want to read God could speak God correct so God had his hand on somebody got his hand on Paul a different one throughout the ages to write to speak to send the word a message from a supernatural God send this word to them to be encouraged Amen to keep your faith in God the same God I called you out is the same God will take you all the way to Heaven amen glory to Heavenly places amen in Christ Jesus wonderful so that is why God sent us a prophet see because he needs to get a message to us in this last day amen he got somebody he could use speak through and that's how we're here today shout message went out call us praise God from all walks of life here we are and now it's up to us individuals to walk this narrow road to walk this straight gate to walk this narrow way few there be that find it a Straight Gate I don't think it's straight like what you're thinking as straight in terms of like a line that word straight means odd it's kind of like strange to the eye you'd miss it if you were driving too fast but somehow God allowed you to turn around and take a look at this one more time because there's some way I want you to be there's somewhere I want you to go you interrupt your flow interrupt your your program to show you a better way a more excellent way oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen amen to show you what he has to show you because by that process you're going to become perfect praise God have you continued on a highway you might have been on a Highway to Hell but God pull you off to the side and allowed you to look just like you pulled Moses off to the side and said what is it attraction upon the mountain I will turn aside to look and see what this thing is and that's all God wanted to do that was the start of something good when Moses turned aside to look all the time he had questions all the time he had doubts all the time he had fears but when he turned aside to see that's when God started something good in his life and this morning my brother this morning my sister God wants you to Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus all the time you have doubts all the time you have fears all the time you have questions but this morning if you could Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look upon the glory of his wonderful Pace look upon his word this morning cast your eyes on this that could be the thought of something good this morning I challenge you to believe it I challenge you to turn your eyes this morning lift your hands worship him get in the spirit turn your attraction set your affection on things above Hallelujah and let God take you over to the side somewhere give your power and let the whole world know that he is witch hey man that's his promise and he's happy to fulfill that promise with his sons and his daughters as evidence that he keeps his word God's Gonna bless you so much that it's going to be evidence to the devil that God keeps his word God's gonna let your cup overflow he's gonna anoint you at all until your cup run over in the presence of your enemies God not shame to do it you don't feel know how to do it because that is evidence that God keeps his word oh he's gonna keep us over this morning he's Gonna Fill you he's gonna seal you oh stay without worrying man Hallelujah so we know that there are three rounds right humanistic divine revelation and vision so God sent us a prophet in his last day and that gift of God is what goes up into the Realms of the supernatural and sees a vision so it's beyond humanistic uh Revelation in that sense he goes way up into Dusty the Lord Etc is that right and of course that would kind of fail here's a prophet talking about it here and you put in the position of Christianity uh paragraph 54 he said and God liken the prophet to the ego that will go up in the makeup of a prophet he's a Seer that in the spirit he's describing it now in the spirit he climbs beyond the emotion of the church wow so people going through stuff and whatever right the Prophet this year he goes beyond all that beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music how descriptive he goes beyond the Clapping of the hands I could see it now amen amen he goes beyond the joy and the Saints he goes beyond all that and God bring him up into a realm alone alone Prophet says it twice alone and then he opens his eye and he lets him look around and see things that is to come Visions pictures seemingly almost real right then he comes back down and among the members of the body to foretell to them what is in the making it's not so these pictures that are coming to him it's not coming in Emotion because the prophet said he's beyond all that this is not coming in the Clapping of hands or how loud you shout this Vision realm we're talking about is a vision it's around beyond all of that beyond the noise of here you hear an asylum something speaks something comes forward picture Prophet said sometimes it's almost so real he could feel the wind on his face in that Vision World sometimes when he's here on the Earth he is not sure whether he's in a vision or he's in reality because they're both almost the same oh what a gift of a prophet that God gave us in his last days to see because not many people live in that Realm only few people can live in that room and God just had a man on the Earth in all time and all day to have that kind of a gift to be able to do that a lot of people live in a humanistic maybe many of us here this morning thinking about whether we forget the iron on or we left the stove on this morning huh you think about that we think about all the things in the car I'd have to fix and all the bills are not paid yet it's still in the humanistic above that is divine revelation and then above that is Vision so the prophet is taken way up look how high he is above clapping of hands above people shouting above the negative above the noise above everything else oh in a place where God is on a place where his thoughts are and the prophet has the ability to see these Divine things to see these pictures these visions of things that are yet to take place thus say the Lord things that are going to be no wonder he could talk about that egg-shaped car isn't that right no one that you could talk about Nazism and all that I've been swallowed up in the communism and the whole thing he saw it was seven visions that must come to pass before the Lord come oh he saw it happen in front of him and God cannot lie that is the mind of God that Prophet a prophet saw and when he comes down and speak it he's speaking according to the mind of God oh and that Prophet saw official of a bride Marching In Step she was marching left right left right she had her garments on spotless she was Marching In Step she was marching holy holy unto the Lord oh I believe he saw you I believe he saw me I believe he saw us coming out of the world marching onward to Jesus Christ Marching In Step Marching In Holiness Marching In Purity only five lives say anything to them just as sweet uttering their voices in sweetness and humility thousands of live voices coming out of the world marching into Glory that's what he sees this morning [Music] amen so do you see it now think on this amen so you're not Ram alone isn't that right all right paragraph 55 he said so God took Ezekiel that scripture I think it's Ezekiel 8 right yeah high and far up and if you have time we should read it it's very interesting Ezekiel actually describes how God took him by a lock of his hair and took him up into a dimension Between Heaven and Earth and he saw things he said a man look what all men do look at the men look what the men do in the dark they think I'm not seeing they like it so they're doing stuff and they say go to see us we shut the door but you say look Solomon look what they're doing watching them long time I just let you take a sneak take a peek I watching them since they start since they began coming off that beaten part watching them from that long time and I already know the end from the beginning I already know where they're going to end up that's why you call for those slaughtering angels to purge praise God amen amen but before you send them an incarnate with an ink on by his side was sent to put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the Abominations being done in the city therefore if you have a sign your heart when you see all these signs happening when you see all these movies being made and things being done it is a sigh a cry in your heart Lord surely you send a prophet not for naught surely your spirit is here to do something surely I didn't come all this way Hallelujah just to be uh pray to the devil surely I didn't come all this way for nothing where is the Lord God of Elijah if God be God then where are the Miracles surely I want to save for nothing I didn't come to church for nothing I didn't come all this way I didn't come out of my father's house just to sit around and eat pig food surely the economy is something better than this if you got a cry in your heart this morning God could work with that God could work with that God Corner writer this morning to put a sarmark upon those that have signed and crying that have a grievance or on their hearts for more of God for the works of God for the things of God that need God that you want God that you're desperate for him oh Hallelujah didn't come to church just occupy a church bench but to fall asleep or to take up space no no no no you come for your portion you come for your inheritance I come for what's mine I come for change in my heart and in my life I come for change in my walk a change in my talk help me deal with my circumstances help me deal with my situation because what I got I can't make it with it what I got is not enough I need something more this morning how many needs something more this morning how many recognize that you can't make it in your self you need Jesus says we would see Jesus oh Hallelujah read Jesus in this message we need Jesus in this church we need Jesus in our lives we need Jesus in our hearts we need Jesus Hallelujah in our cars when we drive into work we need Jesus to stand with us hallelujah in the dark times the days are evil but God promised he'd be with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you we need Jesus this morning oh my god well let me hurry on here now think of it now see let him look around okay up looking around about 2 600 years think of it now and let him have a prophet also a gift of knowledge and now he talks about a gift of knowledge Prophet said our knowledge knowledge as he said like an attorney who studies the books when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're paying him for what he knows to present your case before the judge and he types that here now and says and now a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and finds out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible and with the book so it can't just be anything any kind of knowledge can't just be how to how to how to change a car tire it has to be a Godly knowledge spiritual knowledge to compel the Bible isn't that right see so if they're out of the book then they're not received because the judge judges by the book is she so it has to be by the book isn't that right it's not right so that gift of knowledge goes up it is not right in the Bible and it's prophecy it's also prophecy which goes up no wonder the Bible says that um the lion had roared who can but fear and if the Lord God has spoken then who can be prophesied then what we've had all these years is prophecy it shall be it shall be coming out of the Seven Seals seventh on the message of Malachi 4 our Revelation come to us seven Turners give Faith to gather the bride together to give a faith for Rapture and Grace we've been prophesying all these years with a revelation of what God is about to do for us with a revelation of those seven Thunder that utter their voices Mighty Angel all that come from Glory isn't that right rainbow upon his head Feed Us pillars of Fire it's not right he calmed down and he claimed the Earth God said Heaven is my Throne Earth is my footstool do you know what a footstool is it's a little square object you put your foot on it well God come down Mighty Angel come down upon the Earth with pillars of fire put his right foot on the earth left put on the sea and so forth isn't that right he come down to claim what he has redeemed oh Hallelujah honey come down to claim you pillar Fire come down to claim you claim you by fire claim you by power claim you by anointing oh Hallelujah and that message Rose out to catch that bride oh oh there's unbelievers there's make Believers but in the midst of all of that God has a True Believer who's gonna stay with that word oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right he's got some calebs who's got another spirit with them who knows who their father is who knows he didn't come out all these 40 years to occupy space but give me my Mountain oh Spirit of Prophecy Spirit of Prophecy it shall be it shall be I know I'm gonna be filled I know I'm going to be sealed I know I'm going to be adopted I know I'm going to be anointed hallelujah praise God Amen Oh Glory to come so we thank God for revelation [Applause] to know what the prophecy is amen is not right to know what we have to receive that's what kept us on fire all these years that's why we're not lolly in a message just sit around waiting for somebody to give us something like a you know pray like a beggar or something isn't that right but we know who our father is and we know who Jesus is and we know what the Bible said concerning us hallelujah I know we don't see it with our eyes but something in our hearts knows that is real or Revelation 50 plus years in this message but a revelation echo in our hearts Raptor increase then we step out of the pages of the Bible and boldly declare our promises and anoint our promises to ourselves knowing that the time is at hand for this seven Thunder Revival oh that the manifestation all will come into a that revelation will come in to a manifestation when that time comes amen oh Hallelujah that's what we're doing here prophesy from the book amen compare with the book what are we saying something new no what the prophet already said we're just speaking about by by faith believing what he said will come to pass that's all it is but they take a revelation to do that and take a revelation to see your promises in this book and even though the prophet preach many things and reveal many things there's a message for you hard to fill you with the Holy Ghost a message for you to be delivered a message for you to be sealed a message for you to be your top 10 a message for you to put on the whole armor of God to put on the Lord Jesus Christ to put on your seven color rainbow coach and be dressed to go here to meet him for behold the Practical oh make sure your robe is white make sure your alarms are trimmed and Rich because there's a bride crew coming don't be caught with your work undone oh Hallelujah Oh Glory amen Hallelujah oh my God praise God so we got the message now we have to put it into action even and apply these things literally and become like Jesus are we not doing it on ourselves but another spirit is Gonna Come I make these things uh manifested to you but he's on he's knocking at the door this morning I just want you to open up as long as you open up as long as you're willing to turn aside and look that's the start of something good this morning amen so open your eyes open the door to your hearts I let the king of glory come in amen who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle he will teach you how to fight he will dress you in the whole armor of God not just part of the armor but the whole armor of God every part every peace according to the effect you're working of his power every part in you that you need in order to survive this dark and Dreadful World God's gonna put a sword in your mouth to speak the word of God it'll flash like lightning it'll shut the heavens open the heavens do whatever they want to you wait till the seven Thunders under their voices under their voices do that poop oh oh you can really take the word of God and hand it there oh they know how to put it on

mind can't fight him with a butter knife spiritual battle prison worshiping stay in the spirit get out of the humanistic that's why I talked about it you're identifying it because we get it out of humanistic into the Divine and Revelation into into the realm of divine revelation amen not many of us could live in Vision but we can get into Revelation when we get into the spirit then we can catch the mind of God as it comes down you can't be done there and catch a mind of God you gotta call up gotta get closer praise God hello the book is flying through the air but you gotta gotta jump up and
