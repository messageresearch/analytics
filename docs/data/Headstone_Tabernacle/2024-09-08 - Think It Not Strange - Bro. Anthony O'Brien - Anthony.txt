your Bibles um we'd like to turn to portion of scripture there's a slight bit of feedback here um on the mic so just check that amen but praise God um 1 Peter 4 uh we want to read from this morning for scripture amen 1 Peter 4 and we would like to read from 12 to verses 14 inclusively amen 1 Peter 4 and verse2 says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy and if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified may God add blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord once more for your goodness and mercy that has brought us through Lord father Lord myself and this audience here we are

that you would teach us and Inspire us for the day that we are living in granted almighty God bless us now in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats praise God hallah praise God Amen and amen God bless his holy word amen so I have a title this morning my title is think it not strange think it not strange that's the title that uh uh we have this morning by the grace of God and it's a privilege to be here this morning so you want to appreciate uh brother ID and uh giveing the confidence to be here this morning and to preach to you it's a privilege to do it amen to be a servant of Christ we thank God for these servants here this morning and brother and and also brother Isaac OV is here as well praise God we appreciate them in a special way and pray that amen pray that God continue to bless them and and and use them as we labor together Amen to uh to achieve the goal uh of perfection in this age amen somebody has to be inspired to do it we just thank God and give us God give us the inspiration to press forward amen so God bless you um just kind of warming up here amen think it not strange and when God gave the prophet seven visions that must come to pass before God come uh during the unfolding of it um there were three isms that God revealed to the prophet isn't that right that would rise up during that time um and it is said here that these three isms the prophet said here on um broken system sisters he said um that these three isms Nazism fascism and communism he said and I said they all wind up in communism the prophet said Russia will take it all in communism so that's how it it ended up but uh these three isms rose up and of course as we know these are these are spirits and one of these isms was Nazism as we know and when we speak of Nazism obviously we speak of Adolf Hitler and history tells us that Adolf Hitler had somewhat of a disturbing past he had an abusive father his mother would always defend him in his drunken episodes and so forth and this kind of created a love and adoring for his mother that would last until her death he grew up as a struggling youth he tried to applied for Art School uh because he fashioned himself an artist um but he was rejected twice and I'm I'm told that the second time he was told not to come back around this time his mother passes away so so he goes through a lot of tragedy um and of course he got involved in the World War I and different things and and you know the whole story wound up that he ended up being the leader of the German Workers Party which ended up being the Nazi party where he found his voice um to be able to voice his uh idea of the world of course we know how that ended up but a part I wanted to get to In This Strange story is that in the midst of all of this that was happening in that time all that was unfolding let's say in arolf Hitler's life historians cannot quite pinpoint yet where his hatred for the Jewish people started or where that came from they actually still don't know they don't know if it was when he was rejected at Art School they don't know whether he just had a despise for them or what it was it was a mysterious thing it still remained S A mysterious thing today where this anti what they call anti-Semitism or where this hatred for the Jews actually started up but it was a very key thing that evolved in the whole unfolding of World War II and it was a strange thing even other regimes that rose up in that time talking about Joseph's Stalin and uh Benito molini of Italy also shared similar anti-semitic laws as well which means in the midst of all this World War II that would have unfolded during the 1930s and 40s there was this strange hatred for the Jews that was taking place as a strong undercurrent um in spite the war and the the the battles and conflicts that was taking place between countries and and so on and um and as we know God used these isms as they were described by the Lord God called them isms to drive the people of God back to their Homeland they needed to be driven back in order to fulfill prophecy later on here's a prophet saying on the 3 Exodus he said and as it was in Germany and all up into Russia and in Italy the people raised up Joseph's uh Hitler and Stalin musolini who hated the Jew they had to go back to their Homeland Prophet said God he's praying in this message he said God you got ways of doing things that we don't understand and you pressed them no home in Germany everything taken away from them also in Italy and in Russia no place to go and they were sent back to their Homeland just to fulfill the word oh the loving hand of God the prophet said doesn't doesn't sound loving but it is what what the prophet described it as he said how sometimes it looks cruel right of the way that that people suffer but it still he said he call it it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children we thank you Lord amen praise God now precious Pastor over always referenced this so I just wanted to read it back what he said said now I pray God as I see the day that the denomination is pressing the Believers and excommunicating them so this is prophecy now saying that their name must be on a book that they're lost having to do with the other group it's only the tender hand of Jehovah leading them to the tree of life I pray God he said that each one I know they will because it's your word and it can't fail and may we be led to the tree of life that we may be a possessor of eternal life and see the hand of God and we by the eyes of Faith look Beyond these Shadows that we're walking in today and see the promised land laying just ahead amen and amen do you appreciate that this morning hallelujah it's the tender hand of God he call it the loving hand of God and so God often uses these things what look like cruel things what look like harsh things or what look like things that are not to be desired sometimes he uses these things to get us in position to bring us back into the place he want us to be in uh that is why we ought not to think it a strange thing when things happen to us as if some evil thing is taking place with you think it not strange this morning that God is using your circumstance that God is using your trial because there's a place he has for you this morning that he wants you to be in he wants to bring you into a large place a wide place a great place a land flowing with milk and honey a land flowing with prosper perity with the Holy Ghost with healing for your body healing for your spirit healing for your soul where your family could come in oh Hallelujah because of the labors that you did in the sewing they could come in in the reaping and enjoy the Harvest praise God and amen hallelujah so that's what God wants to do this morning I feel yes sir and that's more or less the summary of it amen so God often uses these things to bring his word to pass in our lives and often times these things seem strange to us true we describe them as strange strange because we are not familiar with God's ways and God's ways of doing things isn't that right Isaiah 55 says my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts uh and this this Chasm that exists now between our ways and God's ways didn't always exist but it happened because of Sin Sin caused man to get out of touch with God's ways and God's motives and objectives so much so that it's almost opposite or in reverse isn't that right and most times we are unaware of God's favor in our lives even amidst the misfortunes that life often presents to us we are still unaware of his favor in our lives you know it's funny because uh as I'm saying this I remembered that uh we had gone through an incident about a couple years ago or three years ago um you know me and my wife were home working and uh all of a sudden this truck came into the area and it started doing work on the sewage line and then the entire sewage system came up through my toilet through my shower through my bathroom came into the house and started moving across the living room but the funny thing is as crazy as that sounds and we had to deal with all that on the aftermath um which was quite an episode um the interesting thing is I looked and I saw the hand of God even in that situation because when it came up in there my wife had the the the the responsiveness to grab certain things and get it out of the way to save it uh and I thank God for her but there it was interesting because when the the the stuff came down it came down a step that was in there and when I looked I saw that it for some reason I I don't know to this day but there are certain rooms it just didn't go into I don't ask you to explain it because it's water it's it's it's moving how come it didn't go here how come it didn't go there and when I went into those rooms there were valuable things things that would have been utterly destroyed had that flowed into that that that room there and so I could still say without a shadow of a doubt that even in that situation the hand of God was still there even though he he allowed things to happen to you but you could still safely say it could have been worse but for the grace of God it could have gone way South if God wasn't in the midst he don't let you go through something where his grace can't keep you and for every Temptation he makes a way of Escape for your soul this morning and like a a bird out of the snare of the Fowler we are escaped this morning we ought to be happy today we ought to give God praise every day for the things he's kept us from there ought to be a praise on your lips every time you walk out your front door God you've kept me you've been keeping me you will keep me in my situation oh hallelujah oh glory to God Amen David said his praise shall be upon my lips Contin continually amen continually upon my lips thank you that's right we ought not to ever stop praising God because there's things we don't know about that God is keeping us from and giving God praise and worship it's like paying rent for the things that you got for [Music] free so pay your rent this morning you're in AR rise of some praise this morning you're in AR rise of some worship this morning oh Hall he brought you through a mighty long way and when I look back I realized where would I be was not for the grace of God he was with me in the shadow he was with me in the trial he was with me in the Tempest and when the Storm come to blow me over I saw one walking under water and he said fair not oh Hallelujah that one is here this morning he's always been here don't let the devil steal your joy oh hallelujah oh Hal praise the Risen King amen he is Jehovah Shaman God is present with us he's a present help in time of trouble and in a time of trouble David said he will hide me in his Pavilion in the secret place you know what a pavilion is that's a wide Place have enough room to put your your fireplace and to place your cut just for the journey hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my even in the storm we could find comfort in the word of God Amen and amen so so and these misfortunes come in many forms on now what we just talked about uh with Adolf Hitler there was a great Misfortune that was going on but that was God moving even in in the in the in the macro level right you know of it it was a war conflict but in there yes sir the grace of God pushing the Jews towards their Homeland so I want you to see it now and this is what it is sometimes it might come as a loss of a loved one sometimes sickness takes a home some of us might lose homes houses possessions as the song says some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials all through the blood the blood that cleanses us and the blood that gives us Fellowship one with another amen and despite what happens we can still have Fellowship one with another because the blood of Jesus that was shed for me was shed for you also it was shed for your brother it was shed for your sister it was shed for the bum on the street it was shed for the tax collector it was shed for the banker it was shed for the politician and if you really understand that this morning then you could treat each other with love we could treat each other with respects because the same blood for me is the same blood for you oh and if there's hope for me then there's hope for you this morning and if he did it for me he could do it for you this morning if he saved me he can save you there's nowh you can go that the Great of God cannot reach you He's Got The Whole World in His Hands your daughter is in his hands your son is in his hands your wife is in his hands your husband is in his hands your home is in his hands your family your job where you go Hallelujah is in his hands this morning oh hallelujah amen brother bati oh my Hallelujah Glory oh Hallelujah in this will I be confident one thing have I desired that will I seek after this morning that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life we are in his house this morning I thank God that through it all he gave me the faith to get up this morning to come to his house amen God bless you on the internet you're in his house virtually this morning amen praise God Amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah to inquire in his Temple to behold the beauty of the Lord David loved inquiring of the Lord yes that's right to to seek counsel to find out what to do next one of his favorite PHR phrases and I hope to preach on it one time David always say bring me an ephod bring me that prayer garment I want to find out what God wants bring me an epon let me get down in pray amen oh my all right so where we at now sometimes six takes a hole right but God all all come through the blood so a Christian life is not a strange thing it's not might be strange to the world amen but it isn't really a strange thing see it's predestinated it's intentional it's ordained of God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord they are ordained by the Lord that even if you fall he' make a he would pull you up because he's walking with you you're not alone isn't that right praise God so so that's how it is it's not strange see God himself is not really described as strange if we do check it he's described as strange by others but he usually he's usually described as mysterious right so we say that our God is mysterious uh you know our God is is is is wonderful he's glorious he's Majestic but we never call him strange you see strange has a kind of a negative connotation right you know yeah strange Gods he himself is not strange watch God throughout scripture he actually hates the strange thing right right he usually expresses a certain level of disdain or dislike or discontent or dissatisfaction for the strange thing strange things don't really please God the wrath of God is kindled against those that did strange things in scripture they are not pleasing unto the Lord anytime God calls anything strange it is usually when he's upset with it you know it have certain words that Daddy does use when he's angry you know Daddy is angry when he calls you by your full name or when Mommy or your government name when Mommy is angry when she calls you by your full name or or when he says things a certain way you know there a certain word that comes out well if we learn God's ways and if we begin to learn God's thoughts through prayer and through having a relationship with God and through reading the scripture and the word because as brother brandham said if we want to grow in God we have to read our Bible and pray every day and even in that simple way we could begin to learn his ways and as we learn his ways we begin to learn what he don't like and what he like you know it's like somebody goes to the restaurant all the time and they say give me my favorite and and the waiter says coming right up there's no need for that level of communication CU he already knows what this guy likes he comes there all the time and so if you want to give God a good worship a good praise from your lips and you have to know what your father likes and what how to approach him uh what the approach is when coming to Daddy isn't that right amen and amen so so so as we learn him we understand what is not pleasing to him and anything anytime God calls anything strange usually he's upset with it when he's not pleased with it if you want to trouble God start bringing strange things to him and you see what he does an example of this is in Leviticus chapter 10 and in the previous chapter Moses and Aaron are actually offering spiritual sacrifices unto God and everything is going according to plan right um we won't read it but they offering sacrifices there's certain uh exacts that God is giving to Aaron and instructions how to cut the sacrifice and different things and so they're doing it according to the instruction Moses is uh getting the instruction and they are doing it according to instruction sir and guess guess what God is blessing it at the end of that chapter N9 you will see that the fire comes down and consumes the sacrifice and the people give a great shout unto the Lord um and this is how God likes things done in a certain order and instruction right according to the things that are patterned in heaven uh that is how he give to Moses amen so it's not just spiky VI it's a there's a there's a there's a reason for it amen and even if you don't understand it fully just follow the instructions instru the understanding will come later but a good soldier knows how to in follow the instructions if he says stand here in a vertical position that's what that means stand exactly there you can't stand where you feel like because it BM might drop right there you weren't told to stand there you were told to stand here follow the instruction but in Leviticus 10 verse1 it says and naab and Abu the sons of Aon this is tragic these are the very sons of the priests that are uh doing this the sacrifice and so on he said my they had their own anointing but but my the sons of Aaron took their took watch look what it says he says the sons of Aaron took either of them his censor right and put fire therein they put their fire therein and put incense there on and offered Strange Fire before the Lord which he commanded them not and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord and then Moses said unto Aaron this is it that the Lord spake saying I will be sanctified in them that come n me and before all the people I will be glorified and Aaron held his peace so those guys perished for not having uh fulfilled the law and following the instruction that God give and they give strange incense they brought a Strange Fire unto the Lord and so we ought to be real careful with this scripture uh and I think it's a lesson for us an example for us to see how God deals with strange things when we come to church like we come this morning we ought not to bring a Strange Fire or a strange offering unto the Lord something that he's not familiar with he wants a broken heart this morning he wants a contrite spirit he doesn't want Pride the Bible says he resisted the proud and the arrogant and he know them are far off he has no relationship with them amen isn't that right so hearing is the lesson in this scripture that anytime you find yourself not obeying God's word then you're doing a strange thing oh Hallelujah so let's never be caught in Disobedience this morning we want to offer an acceptable sacrifice this morning we want to come holy into the Lord holy into his presence holy into his Sanctuary we want to have the consciousness of knowing that these ordinances and even coming into this building this morning is a holy thing to approach his presence to come into His Sanctuary it's a a privilege to come here and if you have the ability to come here then we ought to walk in a holy way we ought to walk walk in a purified way in a Sanctified way not bringing strange fires unto the Lord isn't that right because there's a judgment clearly from scripture we could see we're bringing Strange Fire all these things are lessons now we have to take because God wants to take the church to the next level there's going to come a time when people won't just be able to Walt in here um you know unchecked WS in here um you know anyhow or any way you feel like on cuz after a while God's going to say he's had enough and when God has had enough he's had enough he's a god of Mercy but he's also the god of judgment and he will judge right because he's given people a chance to get with the program uh but we have to know how to follow his rules so that's what this word is all about Amen to understand what God wants so that we could obey his Commandments amen so then this strange thing happen is not all right so now watch Genesis 35 here's another example Genesis 35 verse1 God said unto Jacob arise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou flest from the face of Esau thy brother so God is summoning Jacob and his house to come up to bethl to worship and God this is look listen to Jacob's response to God's call to go up to worship listen to this response here and Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments in other words change your clothes don't just roll off your bed in the morning and come up to worship no no no no go take a bath go get refreshed even your natural self he's urging them and he's admonishing them to get cleaned up get cleaned up naturally get cleaned up spiritually he said and let us arise in verse three and go up to bethl and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went oh Hallelujah I just love this this morning because it shows that there's an approach to God oh Hal because Jacob knew that there were people in the camp who had their isms he didn't want that to hinder his worship he didn't want that to hinder his offering so he told them put away those strange Gods put away way all those strange Idols you have among you because we're going to turn the season now we're going to change the tide now we we can't go on the same way we've been going because you've been called we've been summoned to worship oh have you been summoned to worship this morning did God call you out of the myy Clay did God bring you out is God speaking to you this morning then put away strange things from among you this morning he says be separate walk before me and be therefore perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect amen it's a call to Perfection amen Deuteronomy chapter two also but jaran wax fat we're just giving some examples here of God's language how he talks about the strange thing right Deuteronomy 32 but Juran waxed fat and kicked and thou art wax and fat Thou Art grown thick Thou Art covered with fatness and then he forsook God which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation verse 16 says they provoked him to jealousy with strange Gods with Abominations provoked they him to anger and they sacrificed unto devils not to God to Gods whom they knew not to New Gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not oh my my my isn't this a warning this morning a bunch of new stuff that people want to dig up or find or fish for praise God and worship that that that a good Pentecostal can't even agree with my isn't that right praise God but they they they finding new things to worship New Gods when this God of Abraham is who brought us out out of the Wilderness this this God of Jacob is who was there with us and and who presented us a vision this God of Isaac this God of Moses this God of Deliverance this God of power who's been with us all these years oh how can we turn our faces from him when he was the one who put shoes on our feet when he was the one who put money in our pockets when he was the one who when we had nothing thing to eat he provided for us oh remember the Lord in the days of thy youth oh hallelujah oh David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen his seed beg bread that is the God we serve this morning the devil is a liar to come to try and present a new thing this morning we are already too far up the road to turn our backs now on the things that we know to be true oh our faith has only grown stronger stronger in the word of God oh the longer it takes the more positive we are oh Hallelujah because the greater the battle is the greater the victory oh Hallelujah the greater the struggle the greater the trial is the greater the vict Victory is this morning so if God has you waiting if God keeps you waiting then there's something bigger coming up the road hallelujah

big guy was given a fight and sometimes if you want a big prize there's a big fight that goes along with it if there's something really big on the end of that line it's not going to come easy you're going to have a fight on your hands but the bigger the battle the bigger the victory the bigger the fish that's on the end of that line so brother you might be praying in your prayer closet and I feel

keep praying brother oh Hallelujah this is not a time for giving up this is not a time for let go think it not strange oh the fire trial that is upon you this morning oh it's not an evil thing but God has chosen you and elected you and ordained you to bring forth fruit and that fruit will remain it will remain love joy peace it will will remain goodness tenderness long suffering stretches way out it will remain until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen glory be to God so what an encouragement today amen Joshua 24 let's read on more about these strange things right so Joshua said to the people in verse 19 if you want to long you could get it as well Joshua 24 and: 19 but I'll just read it quickly he said and Joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the Lord uh for he is an holy God he is a jealous God and he will not forgive your transgressions or your sin uh if he forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that he have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away he said he the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God we will serve and his voice we will obey amen do you feel that way this morning we're here to obey his voice and if we are doing so we ought to put away strange Gods Among Us and incline our heart unto the Lord God of Israel 2 Chronicles 14 last one and so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David talking about the former Kings and ASA his son reigned in his stead in his days at the last and in the land was quiet 10 years here's some good works amen and ASA did that which God uh which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and break down the images and he cut down the Groves oh that's what we're here to do this morning we're here to put away strange gods in the high places we're here to break down images jealous images and cut down the Groves all the hiding places all the little worship places that things that we room that we make for other things we need to get rid of that stuff this morning and clear our hearts for the holy holy spirit that wants to come in there that wants to revolve in there we've got to make room for him but he doesn't have room with all the stuff that we try to clutter up and try to keep inside there's a commandment this morning that we have to obey if we want to come into obedience with God if we want to find favor with our God we need to put down the idols this morning put away all these strange little things that occupy a Time meaninglessly and spend more time with the Lord spend more time with God take every example every s opportunity that arrives at itself for you to spend time with God if you're sitting in traffic spend time with God if you're carrying out the garbage spend time with God if you're behind your computer spend time with God praying always in the spirit singing spiritual Psalms and songs unto God oh hall there's always something you could do this morning to redeem the time because the days are evil the time that you're living in is a evil time oh Hallelujah but at this time in the evening time God promised that there will be light in the evening time oh and that light is upon you this morning if you could arise this morning oh and put on the armor of light and walk in soberness and walk with a right mind this morning and walk with your hands lifted up and with your heart surrendered with a praise upon your lips if you could walk in a way that is righteous according to his his his statutes he will bless you this morning and he will keep you in all your ways unless you dash your foot against a stone amen and amen so God told the children of Israel when you possess Jericho take nothing with you destroy everything thing isn't that right but we know Aon kept a strange garment hidden among his stuff and his actions cost them 30 and six men when they went up to possess the land of I and of course we know the story I wouldn't read it but an investigation was done they had to find out what's going on they didn't know what would happened but Aon kept a little secret said surely they it wouldn't it wouldn't bother them it's a small thing thing it's a nice tunic it looks good this is a rare silk I mean why destroy it but God already gave an instruction what to do when you get into Jericho he told them ahead of time because he didn't want anything among them God wanted to be their provider Hallelujah he promis to bring them into a large place a land with milk and honey he wanted them to plant their own land and to achieve don't be taking anybody else's stuff this those things are evil they are not of mine yet he found it fit to do that in some way see he transgress God and uh uh uh uh uh and once and strange things started to happen when he took that garment it went into up to eye and they got smoked men died the Bible says that Joshua and went into mourning right after because what they were seeing was not what God had said God said no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of your life but here was men dying in battle this is totally uh different uh from what we expected we expected Victory we expected Victory going into this thing is the Lord not with us and then God started to deal with them and they begin to search the camp triy by try family by Family Man by man to see who was the transgressor of course we know that they had Came Upon Aon who hid his stuff in the tent well they dealt with that situation and they burnt him and his family they got rid of the problem by fire isn't that right they called it the valley of acor they Mark the territory don't even go near that Valley pray God because that is transgression to the the Lord amen so in this time and season that we are about to approach cuz God is getting ready to turn the tide now we're going to go into spiritual things they are not strange things these things are according to the things that pattern in heaven God's going to pour out his Spirit upon you he's going to anoint he's going to make his ministers a flame of fire discernment is going to drop down God is going to speak once more like he spoke excuse back there in the book of Acts when holy men spake as they were moved by the holy ghost that time is coming again and I feel this morning that God is warning us against strange things do not bring a Strange Fire unto the Lord this morning but make sure your sacrifice is right that your heart is right that your approach is Right amen amen of course they got rid of Aon his family and all that buried them on the stones and now God begin to deal with them and God said take a portion of men God start to give instructions now because his his wrath was no longer kindled against them God is now happy to give instructions he said take a portion of men and go up to ey he said and when they come run back play like you're running but keep a portion of men to the west and let them lie in weight and when they empty the city with confidence to beat you let the men of the West run into the City and smoke the city oh Hallelujah and they did as the Lord commanded and when the men saw that the city was smoked they tried to run back but it was too late Joshua and his men smoke the people of ey oh Hallelujah and surrender their King it his hands God will give you Victory when you get rid of all the things that are clogging up your prayer life your Christian Life when you are get ready to get next to God and as the prophet said set your face towards heaven put your hands toward Heaven oh let your pants legs be bagged at the knees oh Hallelujah when you're ready to do that then God will meet you and take you over to the side somewhere and adopt you and give you a gift and let the whole world know he is with you I'll never leave you I'll never for forsake you I promise to be with you in your trial with you in your test he is with you in your storm the Bible said the Lord went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs with wonders and with Miracles that is what God wants to do the end time church friends let's get ready for it amen oh my so when God does something it's not a strange thing God himself is not strange he is righteous he is just he is Holy he is pure in all his ways holy is his name this morning and it might seem strange to us because our thoughts and perceptions of life and reality are so far away from God's thoughts that what we have to do this morning is to forsake our own way yes sir forsake our own thoughts in order to even understand God's ways he said the let the right uh let the Wicked Man forsake his thoughts amen amen let them seek the Lord isn't that right while he may be found and call upon him while he is near amen when we are void of understanding the only thing we have left is Faith to trust that whatever God puts us through this morning is for our good isn't that right amen so think it not strange don't think of it this morning as a strange thing as the scripture we read in 1 Peter 4 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you yes sir oh so the fiery trial actually has an objective what is the objective of the fiery trial it is to try you Amen to prove that that you are really who you say you are to prove that you are not like Eve but brandham said this bride will not be like Eve she will not be deceived well in order to prove that you have to be tried you have to be tested you have to be proven and you have to be able to take that word oh hallelujah hallelujah and die to your senses die to your unbelief die to your way of doing things and receive God's word concerning your life but as much as you are partakers of Christ sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy in other words you are happy when God is happy and you mourn when God Mourns because you are like him in his image and likeness amen and you share the same values you share the same beliefs the Bible said how can two walk together unless they agree your spirit have to come into a condition this morning where you can agree with the things that God agree with then when he calls something strange you call it strange too and when you say something is wonderful he says something is wonderful too because you share the same ideas after a while you begin to think the thoughts of God this is how in sync God wants you and him him to become this morning to walk in his statues and to live in his presence amen so think it not strange that God hath called you this morning that he has chosen you and ordained you think it not strange that you are here this morning that God brought you out of all that you've been through every trial every test that he brought you think it not strange this morning think it not strange that he woke you up think it not strange that Millions were lost when you were saved think it not strange that you were born in the family that you were born into that was for a purpose that was for a a whole thing that God wanted to unfold that only when you look back you begin to see that it was the hand of God in your life it wasn't a strange thing that he put you in the job he put you in it's not a strange thing that you're going through what you're going through now he had ordained it he had already thought of it in his mind but he also put overcoming power in you this morning to face the test think it not strange this morning concerning the trial so here's our synopsis this morning what is strange to man isn't strange to God but what is strange to God man usually tried to make himself acquainted with see so I'll say that again just for clarity what is strange to man isn't strange to God but what is strange to to to God Yan usually makes himself acquainted with and so there's a misalignment of values and beliefs and uh and uh and uh we usually misappropriate strange things as a result misappropriate the supernatural we misappropriate the move of God in our lives because we don't know how to interpret it we're trying to interpret it through the lens of our own mind and our own understanding not realizing that it is God's work per Adventure in our lives amen isn't that right so that we end up calling the things of God strange and what God calls strange we are often too willing to accept amen isn't that right praise God okay so I read this already so amen all right so let the wicked forsake his way this morning and the unrighteous man his thoughts Isaiah 55 and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him oh Hallelujah God will have mercy upon us when we turn towards him oh will you turn towards him this morning and to our God he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways are your ways my ways say the Lord for as the heavens are high higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts thoughts than your thoughts isn't that right and it might have seemed strange when God told Abraham that he was going to bring for a child in his old age that seemed like a strange thing Sarah being Barren also and was told that you were going to bring forth a son this was the word of the Lord for that day Abraham you are going to have a son no matter how old you are no matter how sickly you are no matter what the doctor said say it's not a strange thing but this is my word to you this morning that even in the midst of your situation you are going to have a son praise God Amen and what is strange to man isn't strange to God hallelujah but God needed an impossible situation to prove that nothing is too hard for God Isn't that right he said why therefore did Sarah laugh is anything this morning too hard for the Lord but at the appointed time I will return unto you and Sarah thy wife shall bring forth a son isn't that right might have seem a strange thing that after Isaac was born God told this same Abraham to offer up thy son upon an altar isn't that right that seemed like a strange command to us but to God all things are possible God God knew what he was doing God knew he wanted to test his son to see if he would really go all the way and obey his every command isn't that right where's your love Abraham is it for me or is it for something else isn't that right what a request for God to make to Abraham after that he had given Abraham a son after 25 years of testing that's right isn't that right on his fate he now had to offer up the same son isn't that right and that seemed like a strange thing to us but God knew what he was doing Abraham's Faith didn't waver and we know that because he told a man he said I and the lad go up and I and the lad will come back down Abraham knew that God was a provider and he was going to provide for himself oh hallelujah hallelujah he was going to make away out of nowhere all he had to do was obey oh Hallelujah when they went up the mountain sometimes you got to go up the mountain Hallelujah to get what God has for you they start to get the word and the fire and Isaac begin to say but Daddy I see the word I see the the fire but where's the sacrifice where's the offering for the sacrifice and he said Son don't you worry God will provide for himself oh I don't know how it's going to happen I'm just doing what God said to do and this morning we are just doing what God told us to do God told us to go up to stay with the word to stay with his promises to stay say what the tape say and to believe every word that was preached by Malachi 4 oh had to stay with that word and despite every trial despite every test where hold it on to faith to know that God will make a way where there seem to be no way he works in ways we cannot see it might seem to be a strange thing uh but God knows what he is doing this morning think it not strange oh Hallelujah think it not strange oh H when things happen you don't expect God is only testing your faith to see if you really believe this message or if you're going to turn back many walked away many have turned their backs but God put a faith in your soul this morning that's the only reason you made it this far he opened every door he cleared every river for you to be here this morning and you are here to acknowledge your God this morning to acknowledge the one who brought you through oh Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my give him praise [Applause] amen amen and amen my it seems strange but Abraham did what God said that's right when he was coming down with a knife the angel had to call twice just to stop him in his trap is God saw that he had done enough to prove that he was uh willing to do what God whatever God said what an obedient man what an example that we could take from God's servants this morning patriarch of Faith Abraham uh and what he was willing to do amen because he had loved God so much isn't that right might have been a strange thing when God told Noah to build an ark because rain was coming that's a strange message we accustom with rain now that's right but back then rain had never fallen before we have to remind ourselves that the message that God gave Noah was a strange message to the people at that time because they had never seen it before and God set it up that way so that if anyone were to believe Noah's message they had to believe for something they had not seen but but even Jesus said blessed are they that have not seen and yet they still believe oh Hallelujah isn't that right we walk by faith and not by sight oh it takes Faith to believe God's word because the world will never give you enough evidence to prove that that thing is real you have to dig deep inside and find the faith that God give you to believe what he has revealed in his word because the revelation of God's word is what gives you Faith to stand the test God revealed to Abraham he was going to have a son and he stood on a revelation of that faith and God counted that faith for righteousness amen amen hallelujah isn't that right he made it in because of the righteousness of his faith that he had in God and the same thing with Noah a strange message to preach his message was not in keeping with the science of that day with the technology of that day there was no evidence to prove Noah's message yet it was what God gave him to preach and every Sunday morning he preached the same message like a broken record every single day he flip it he boil it he fry it he cut it up in pieces he steam it it was the same message same inspiration same title same subject it will rain oh and he stood with that message for 120 years oh and it's been 50 plus years since the prophet came with a message and we are staying with that message seven tunders give fate seven tunders gather the bride together seven tunders give the bride fate for Rapture and Grace to take us out of here the only hope we have left is those Seven Locks CL on Samson's head and the only hope for the church today is for her to find the coin which she has lost to restore the Covenant to add to your faith seven things oh to build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith after that you have received the Holy Ghost make yourself a Christian that's what we're here to do this morning so every Sunday we're here to make make ourselves a Christian make a church make a Revival in our homes in our lives the Revival will come by the people when you get a revelation of who you are and what you can do by faith you can bring on another Ephesians you can bring on a seventh under Revival the bride is called to go up oh to go up yonder oh oh to catch that headstone to step into that void oh God and produce Jesus Christ again in the natural among human beings oh just imagine a picture like that Jesus forgiven in you Jesus in you walking Jesus in you Healing The Sick raising the dead freely as he have received freely do you give out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water out of the very depths of you oh H shall flow a river oh we haven't seen power like what's coming into the church now the prophet said I know it for a fact it won't last long but it will be here and when it is let us be glad and rejoice oh hallelujah amen in as much as you are partakers of Christ offering but when his glory is revealed we will be glad also amen and amen man how am I going for time here okay so a few more few more minutes left all right you're going we're going fine this morning amen yeah are you happy this morning amen my so you see so God told him to obey no preach that message and he lived it also by building an ark he didn't just talk about it this is the part we want to get to now where we go beyond the talk it's easy to say what somebody else said or to speak back something but to show you really got the Revelation is when your actions are in alignment with the things that you you profess to be true and Noah just only uh preach the message that God gave him but he lived it by building that Ark that God said to build he put it together he put it on dry land think think about this now this he literally built his ark in central he didn't go on maracus Bay and built the ark you know some stories might have it the ark built and you see the water next to it and but reality it was in the middle of like I don't know a plane somewhere I don't know how it looked exactly but it wasn't near to any Bay Area that you could say Okay Noah I get the I see the plan when you finish build the ark we'll get some wheels or something and push this thing down into the water I mean that makes sense that that's a way that that see it right on T man she build a boat near to the water but he built this Ark on dry ground no you had to drive through the desert to get to Noah to get to church if he was going to sit in his congregation that morning to hear the message of the Ark while he preached in front of the open door saying come into the ark for rain is about to fall he preach it like it was present tense he preached like it was going to happen tomorrow like it was going to happen this afternoon like right now so good was his faith so strong was his conviction that it was going to happen yet for 120 years they laughed at him Bible says he was a he was the guy of the day you know I guess every year they would publish a paper and say this is a new year and Noah is still building the ark and whatever next year come on papers New Year happy New Year everybody God bless you and Noah is still building the ark happy New Year everyone wonderful Merry Christmas we season greetings Noah is still building an ark but one day The Laughing had to cease because God called Noah and his family into the ark and then God shut the door shut the door and sealed them in after they had done all that they were supposed to do God was now ready to preach his message oh H isn't that right and when the Rain Begin to Fall it rained and it rained and it rained and it did not stop until the whole world was covered in water isn't that right amen and they tried to get in then but it was was too late what God had said had come to passl it always does isn't that right so think it not strange this morning what God has called you to do you might be the only one in your family you might be the only one in your workplace or the only one in your street but God has called you as an individual to stand for righteousness in this last day when the righteous are so scarce to be found the Bible says Where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear somebody has to pray for them somebody has to go after them there is a Ministry for the bride to go after the loss in this message to go after the loss and bring them in before those terrible that terrible time comes isn't that right amen when Moses saw the burning bush in the distance he was puzzled there was something strange about this bush that he had not seen before and the angel of the Lord appeared to him Exodus stre in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the Bush was burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned when the Lord saw that he had turned aside to see God called out to him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here I am here am I isn't that right and he said draw not hither no put thy Sho uh put but put thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground oh Hallelujah as we say the fire didn't come for the bush it come to speak to Moses it come to do something for Moses oh Hallelujah sometime he come in a strange way but think it not strange that he come in a burning bush cuz Moses had seen fires before but he had never dealt with one like this it didn't get bigger it didn't get smaller it remained just that way it remained constant ever burning it wasn't going out this wasn't a natural fire this was a supernatural fire and God's fire is constant it's ever burning it's always there it's a fire by night it's a guide for you oh H when all of the lights are gone out he is a light for us in a dark place it's ever burning it's ever constant and if the Holy Ghost ever come into your heart if God ever baptize you with the fire of the Holy Ghost then when he gets into your heart he's ever burning he's ever constant he's ever Eternal he is with you in your trial the anointing will be in your heart to teach you how to walk in Jesus name he'll show you what to stay away from he'll teach you about strange things and he'll set your heart towards eternally eternity amen not a strange thing but it is God and that's how he does amen hallelujah it's his nature his being and how he moved his people throughout the ages I believe he'll move that way yes but the real job of leadership oh is when the situation is call for somebody to stand for a just cause you have to be able to rise up and is there not a cause oh who is this uncircumcised Philistine who defiled the armies of the Living God I will chop his head off oh and God is calling up people today unlike any other people that the world has ever seen think it not strange that you are the way you are God loves you just as you are because he wants to use you this morning to chop the enemy to Ribbons oh Hallelujah by faith he used Moses by faith he used Joshua by faith he used Joel and different ones all throughout scripture and by faith this morning he has a bride on the earth I know Hallelujah she's here this morning oh H my little anointed ones God is going to raise up Messiahs little anointed ones that he could use for his honor and His glory oh Hallelujah think it not strange this morning oh she said call for a fast in shushan I and my people will Fast also and she said if I perish I perish but I go in to see the king oh God knew oh Queen Esther would have what inside of her he put what he needed inside of her to rise to the occasion when it was needed the most David Rose to the occasion when it was needed the most and he slew that Philistine Goliath and God is going to put inside your heart what is needed the most that when the situation presents itself the faith that God put in your soul amidst All Odds will rise to the occasion oh this morning rise to the occasion this morning rise up in oh Hallelujah and receive your portion receive your inheritance receive what God has for you this morning Hallelujah think it not strange when the angel Gabriel appeared unto Mary and he told her that she was to bring forth the Christ and that his name would be called Jesus she asked how shall these things be she knew no man what a strange message to bring but the angel answered her and he said the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and bring forth that promised child and she said be it done unto me according to Thy word that was not Mary's mind speaking that didn't make sense but it was a message she reive in her heart and at that very moment me to happen within her because she had received the word oh that the angel brought oh Hallelujah be done unto me according to Thy word God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost this morning be Aon unto me according to Thy word God wants to test you with the fiery trial this morning be it done to me according to th word when you go out of here let the words upon your lips say be it done to me Lord according to Thy word let me be stripped let me be beaten let me be crucified with Christ I don't want to be the same no more I want to be changed be done unto me according to your word if you have to cut me if you have to boo me if you have to break my pride then do whatever you have to do this morning be it done unto me according to Thy Word not according to my feelings not according to what I like not according to what I am accustomed to but according to Thy word at Thy word Lord I will do your commandment what a young lady what an inspired young lady amen amen many young women like that in scripture but Mary stands out because of her faith to willingly accept what God Said hallelujah oh H isn't that right when she began to do that thank you Lord strange things started happening there was persecution from her family they didn't understand what was going on how you could do that did you what man did you know she keep giving them the testimony God told me that I would have a child it didn't make sense it was a strange thing to them but Mary didn't think it strange because she heard from the angel if they didn't hear from the angel that is their business but she heard from the angel and she come to church this morning to worship God for what the angel told her if you can't praise God this morning and maybe you need to hear from the angel but for those of you who heard from the angel this morning lift up your hands for your Redemption Joy n for I saw an angel come down from Heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head and he cried and seven voices utter their voices Oh and those voices caught you this morning and we are alive today oh by the voice of him that cried amid the seven golden candlesticks hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God oh man my God hallelujah amen amen hallelujah what a strange message it was but she received it when she receiv received that word Christ begin to form see even the government started up with tax laws and all these things isn't that the census bringing the people back to the place of birth and whatever and by that they had to come back to Beth Bethlehem why because God's word uh had to be fulfilled while Christ was being formed in Mary yes the persecution set in trouble on every hand the prophet said watch what happen What take place he said the devil actually goes on a rampage because he knows that Christ is being formed in you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the devil going on a rampage or the fiery trial this morning is only evidence that something is happening inside of the Bride this morning that something is happen happening in your heart under your skin God has found a place to dwell inside of you and it's too late for the devil God is going to be formed line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little every Sunday every Wednesday God will rebuild the church again under the power of the Holy Spirit oh he'll have another one that he can rest his hand upon and say Here's my spirit flowing freely here's another one over there here's another one over there I can place him I can place her the placing of the church oh God has longed for this moment when people could find their place find their purpose in God and serve in that office amen and amen amen how many love the Lord today praise God so think it not strange now think it not strange that God will call a prophet out these last days 20th century Prophet William Mariam brandham to bring us an end time message just before the great and terrible day of the Lord think it not strange this morning that he went through all that he went through he lost his wife he lost his child he lost the anointing for about 5 years isn't that right God put him through hard trials sometimes he pray and a black curtain drop down that might seem harsh that might seem cruel but God was forming his prophet he had to come to obedience because the level that he wanted to take him to it takes obedience to get there oh H you have to be able to follow my every command you need to be able to walk with me I can't stand Disobedience I can't stand strange things oh h no strange fires you got to do exactly as I have told you follow my instructions and I will be with you I will never forsake you I will always be with you isn't that right oh Hallelujah God put him through hard trials what was it God training his son getting him ready for the ministry that he had for him God training this last prophet to the age isn't that right of laia 1963 seven angels come down from eternity isn't that right right form of a cloud the world saw it they thought it was a strange thing but that was God himself seven angels descending from Heaven according to Revelation 10 1-7 isn't that right I saw another Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head his feet as fillers of fire oh how he come down from heaven with a book oh how give it to his Prophet he's ready now he's been trained he's been trained on the back side of the desert oh he's been tradition trial been through this test oh Hallelujah and if God put him through all that what do you think about us this morning think it not strange concerning the fire trial that is upon your life it is God in you working his way out of your situation God promised to make a way in your Valley to make your Desert Blossom oh you just got to stay with that word and don't look to the left don't look to the right stay with what he said and God hallu will fulfill his word exactly what he said isn't that right Prophet said that you will call okay this is a revelation of Jesus Christ listen to this and this is how see um okay let me read it you'll recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book that we're studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages and then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it Hallelujah in other words you will think that it's a strange thing but it takes the holy spirit this morning to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it Hallelujah and he said bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't just take ordinary study Hallelujah and thinking to make this book real but it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people oh that's you here this morning that book cannot just be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God oh are you hearing from God this morning then God put that ability in you to be able to hear his word in a day when people don't want it in a day when America kicks God out you have the ability to hear from God oh he that an an ear let him hear what the spirit of God sayth unto the churches oh he is speaking to you this morning come out of her my people think it not strange oh hallelujah oh my it will require Supernatural instructions that we have to follow in order to follow we got to know the instructions God revealed all these things to a prophet oh we thank God so that now we have Supernatural instructions isn't that right and not just a student comparing verse with verse like in a you know in a studied kind of way like that he said he said though that is good he said but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear amen isn't that right that's why brother always says Revelation ought to make us humble because we couldn't reveal it to ourselves it was God that reveal it to us then when you get a true Revelation the hands go up the tears come down your cheeks because you know he showed it to you and if he didn't open your eyes to see you still be walking in darkness but we thank God this morning that Upon This Rock God promised to build his church upon the revelation of Jesus Christ in this last day bride how he's going to be formed in You by seven spirits seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit isn't that right oh Hallelujah and he said not as a student but a mystery requires teaching of the spirit or it never comes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know he said think it not strange say so so think it not strange isn't that right that the seven Thunders are the seven voices of the seven Church ages seven manifestations in one Holy Spirit into the church as Faith a live voice virtue a live voice knowledge a live voice Temperance a live voice patience a live voice Godly a live voice brotherly kindness a live voice thundering out in sweetness and humility and it is these divinely reveal mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers thinking not strange oh they couldn't understand it all these years but you wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice it'll C they can close the heavens they can shut this they can do that whatever they want to Glory the prophet said Hallelujah he'll be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth is sharper than a two-edged sword Prophet said they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God yeah amen that God always it's his word but he always uses man to work it so you have been called this morning men and women to work the word oh hallel that he has put in his last days amen amen amen you have been chosen think it not strange this morning that God is speaking to your heart this morning you are the man you are the woman that God wants to use today and to pour His Spirit into you and to build you up into this stature of a perfect man oh my I'm getting ready to close now conclusion so thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you God is not the author of confusion Ecclesiastes 3 says to everything there's a seasonall and a time to every purpose under the heaven a fiery trial has a purpose and as we read uh in 1 Peter 4 that purpose is to try you amen it's to prove you prove that you are not like Eve the only way to prove that is to try you amen is to test you that's right and the only way he can give you power is if he tries you he has to prove that you are worthy of it before he can give it to you and according like the prophet said in that message he's got to shake your box car in order to he can't seal you if it's too loose isn't that right if he wants to seal you with the Holy Ghost this morning if it's too loose he can't seal it pack it over again it's got to be packed right no strange Gods no strange fires no strange offerings but exactly what he said to put in there according to his specifications it's got to be built right and when it's packed right then the inspector can come by once he checks it and he likes what he sees he says it is good give them the Holy Ghost give them the seal until the day of their Redemption oh Hallelujah give them that Holy seal and that's what we come for this morning we want to be packed just right may God put into us all of the value that us be packed just right fit for sealing but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ sufferings we go through sufferings to pack us just right so that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy Psalms 118 says the Lord is my strength and my song and is become my salvation the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous oh Hal the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly the right hand of the Lord is exalted musicians get ready to come the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord for the Lord had chasen me sore but he had not given me over unto death open to me the Gate of righteousness and I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter and I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me are you here to praise him this morning I will praise thee and thou become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord has made and we will rejoice and be glad in it amen and amen praise the name Lord do you love him today oh my Hallelujah one more quote and then finish uh this is the prophet's message and I see that shall possess the gates of the enemy 1962 he said that of it is like I was saying last night the Pentecostals are waiting for a rushing Mighty Wind but they fail to hear that still Small Voice see that is it's so wrong to do those things they think so as long as the wind is rushing it's all right but that didn't attract the prophet's attention the rushing wind never bothered the Prophet Elijah in the cave Mighty Thunders and Lightnings pouring down never attracted him but what startled him was that still Small Voice that something speaking with inside my word is truth let every man's word be a lie and mine be true that's what attracted the prophet see you could you could begin to play something softly if you would and it still do it it'll still do it the word of God always attracts the spiritual mind because it is the mind of Christ in you that knows that the word is true true oh we know the word is true this morning he said in paragraph 87 he said and you go through a testing time the church goes through a testing time each individual goes through a testing time before it can ever possess the Gate of the enemy Abraham went through it Christ went through it after Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit there at the River Jordan he went through a testing time amen after Abraham was called out put into his hand where he was to be a pilgrim then give circumcision then God met him and time after time yet he had to go through the time of testing you can begin to stand every Seed of Abraham does the same thing Abraham and his seed an organization a church that's the reason we find ourselves organizations Falling by the ways sign is become when it because when it comes to the test what test he says God's word there's the test God's word is the test will you stay with his word amen and will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what God says do that's the difference he says may God add h a blessing to his word let's all stand and just worship him I'm finished oh Hallelujah Let's Just Praise Him Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus through the waters some through the blood oh can
