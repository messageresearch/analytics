the specialists even the ones that sang tonight my beautiful water chorus leaders the musicians everyone so may God richly bless you [Applause] playful brother a man he needs you tonight so I got a little subject here tonight so if it you why are you standing I normally read from the Old Testament to the new but I'm gonna start from the new ending up to the old so we're gonna read first John 1 second Corinthians 6 and Micah verse 6 so if you have your Bibles we're gonna read first John first John one I'm great verse three to seven that which we have seen in Earth declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us and through our fellowship is with the father there's a little feedback someone is what the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full verse then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin isn't that beautiful didn't we have some wonderful fellowship this weekend my water place meets beam and then we turned to second Corinthians from verse 66 verse 16 and what agreement has the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them so I'm emphasizing that walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the LORD touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord God Almighty and then Micah chapter six and we read from verse seven and eight with the Lord we please were thousands of rams over ten thousands of rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the son of my soul yes show thee O man what is good and what does the Lord require of thee watch what he requires but just to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God make order placing the word you may be seated so tonight I want the enemy to know it's a prey line but I want him to know brother brems is the weakest Christian the weakest we're not even speaking of the eros yet but the weakest Christian can defeat Satan anyway anytime and under any circumstances so tonight I know he's in trouble brother because the weakest Christian is going to drive him out tonight hallelujah so tonight I like to take a title walking with God amen and I'd like to take a subject fellowship that was broken but fellowship restored and I got inspiration restored to an Eden condition so tonight I don't know this is such a well although 2 hours 7 but I hope I can speak like you and everything so you will have to watch with the perspiration when it yields 2 hours he said ok so he says here now we we got you got to travel with me and we go to the Garden of Eden and we looking from the outside in and we see this beautiful picture and then I can hear he speaking our God of Adam telling Eve and then I can hear him say dear do you see the Sun is setting it's time that we talk to the father so they went up to the Cathedral a great tree as they knelt down all of a sudden a heavenly growing light came down the logos the holy spirit that had proved them out of the earth came down father God and he said children have you enjoyed yourself today sure my so fathers having fellowship with his son with his children and then Adam says yes father and then he says I've come down to kiss you good night and to lay you down to to rest tonight so he kissed him on the cheeks laid him down nothing good on them he was right in the bushes with him the lion and he laid the lion down and he laid the chips are down and the tiger down and laid them all down to rest and father was so pleased so you can mention while they lain their fathers walking around them and he's looking in his oh my so beautiful he's so pleased and he's so happy and we're looking at this beautiful picture and in the beginning when God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day and his great voice whispered to them and they had fellowship so brother Lou you you spoke on the net the three things fellowship eternal life and inheritance but I want to do out tonight mostly on fellowship because fellowship always brings results it gives birth to something I mean so he says here and there fellowship loved one another how the moving of the Spirit went through the bushes the Lions come up the Tigers in all of them and they worship the Lord man was conscious at all time that the presence was with him hallelujah then he says here he says and in the beginning when man used to walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden when the first man was created in that Greek great Cathedral under the palms he and his wife when the cool of the evening come along they come out and worship God had a perfect fellowship God longs for fellowship and by the overt you said God want to save us more than what we want to be saved well he says now he wants more fellowship than what we were at one fellowship tonight so I hope you came in here tonight to worship Him you're not going to get anything if you sit in their own data you're gonna have to worship Him and fellowship with him and show him that you love him that's how you get something from God you conscious of his presence hallelujah and the process and even his wife and the cool of the evening come along they came out worship God at perfect fellowship God longs for fellowship and I'm here tonight if that was in the beginning we at the end again so now we at the end in the spirit they in the beginning God love fellowship now we are the last sage the climate God still loves fellowship and is coming down the gain in assuming a bride to do what to have fellowship so if you know what the fellowship God is gonna raise up somebody to take your place and there is no they gonna worship Him hallelujah he says he yes he wants people to speak with him to talk with him he says you you might sing too much or you might preach too much sometime but they've there's one thing you'll never be able to overdo and that is to pray he says here he says I'm gonna leave the books are just going quickly now that the beginning of man that what God gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost the power now we watching at this picture something went wrong and then through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship so fellowship brings relationship so he lost that and friendship fellowship with the father he lost that and all these channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through and then loss is a region in the God of England his relationship and fell that means communion with God was cut off right there because of sin and unbelief and unbelief is what in the world of Almighty God and so this picture was painted and out back there through our first father and mother they fell and that broke off fellowship with God and man was drew from the Garden of Eden from that hour and began to scream and God came down Adam Adam where thou he was hunting for his lost child now I like this when Adam and Eve fell God didn't send an angel hallelujah he didn't send an angel a decent game no God came down himself because it was his child that was lost and God didn't it wasn't a gift God knew he's gonna fall God noon is gonna something is gonna go wrong but you see man always runs from God there's no man that seeks God this look man that says eyes like I saw God and I know God so you oh good night to you in the voice of God calling you and the way down where are you hiding what are you hiding behind now what what but what made you realize you naked so there's a voice calling out my opinion why is lost child now what is tricky it's not that God didn't know because God created his own enemy come on ah you must reach back to me it was respect to me this God we serve created to his own enemy so because now there's a challenge going on it took out six thousand years to create the Eden and his own enemy came right into God's Eden after six thousand years and corrupted Eve and took them out of Eden so God say I must be just and Eve my enemy the same time so he gave him another six thousand years and he creates the Satan's Eden so now you mustn't be shocked what we hear in what we see versus Satan's even this is not the one that God prepared now we go into a city brother a plan you wanna wear there's no Sunnah where there's no sorrow with his legs in pain so we mustn't be shocked when we this happened and that happened versus Satan's Eden but brother I am here to tell you I always hear God's voice and um Adam when about God comes like it's a third season hallelujah God comes right in Satan's even you know what's he doing he's calling out the second Eve ladies say conceding God comes right back and he says come on come on my child you don't belong to the second seed and you come from another dimension you come from another place you talk Nigerian you've not South Africa you're not through an Italian you're not German you're not American you come from my heavenly place that's where you were original and that's where you're going back to [Applause] my so God knew what was going to happen because in him was attributes and he couldn't do it if there was no fool you understand how could he be a same as there was in the sinner how could it be a healer if it there's no one's sick so we allowed that to prove to the enemy listen man I'm greater than you you can make them sick but I can heal them Oh hallelujah you can make them son and you can make him do the most father but you see my blood is gonna forgive them and look at them standing here tonight you know when you come from L suddenly comes short of the glory of God but the power God pull from the gutters of Al and he saved us hallelujah and any changes so he's here this contest is between God and Lucifer but this power is made manifest in the church you with me that's why I say we have to walk with God but the scripture says and walk with you so it's a it's a two-way street this I'll be their God they will be my people I'll walk in them and he says all I ask for you is just to walk humbly don't bring me a thousand dreams don't give me a troublesome oil no I don't want that just be a humble and show mercy and walk humbly before me God hates a proud spirit man Oh [Applause] whoa compliment couple we always under will came short of the glory of God how can I feel I'm bigger than you make me small you know we all see that in heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's no big you in Smoky no we are all the same [Applause] [Music] Wow so he says you know notice in his glory back there when he had sinned God lived felt so sorry for the poor fellow seaman Eve going away going out of the fellowship they would have to shop for themselves what do they do they had a loving father who would take care of them but now through disobedience got old fellowship no more fellowship they had to make it for themselves they had to tell the soil there to earn a living by the sweat of their brow they had to get sick and die in all kinds of troubles holidays and disappointments why severed fellowship no more fellowship with God it couldn't be so now the guy must ship for himself oh he says he never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a headache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the Father and just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked he just got it why everything Oh baby because he was God's child and the child is an heir of all things that's why in Dominion he was God's child but when it was seven all of that was lost now we had to here to fend for himself and son son broke that fellowship man has been tossed from he says about from every wind of doctrine and he still tossed about he was turned out of the Garden of Eden to shuffle and then the skin looks great time he's still talking about God kills some animal took that skins innocent blood of an animal brought the skins and wrapped them around Adam and Eve and there was some fellowship with them again what so God realizes look I can't leave them completely cut off so he makes a tempura he's a temporal condition okay i slayed the lamb that would be me the condition the blood and our covenant schemes and promises as he walked out to the Garden of Eden you could hear the sheep skin eating against their brow and God felt so sorry and the blood running down Lisa's but that was the temporal position for them to come back into fellowship and speak again with Ghana and a fellowship again why through the shed blood of the Lamb hallelujah oh brother I feel a song coming on me he says denomination barriers will never work because you've got two issues you go to this church and Melissa denomination educational science God made one preparation for man to be restored back to fellowship nothing else he offered to the human race but the blood was the way back to fellowship and I say tonight in 2018 there's only one way back to fellowship brother he's not through your church he's not through

them there's something wrong with your experience you need to be at the altar hallelujah my there was Daniel I'm skipping up Daniel prayed as usual not because the kingdom put out a law that anyone train will be someone so find no he went to pray as usual I like that we only pray when we need God promises we make him a mascot Lord my child is sick please come but he prayed as usually opened the windows even but the brim says he was insanely opened the window so they could he ain't brain and they set the trap for him and what did you think hallelujah my they threw me to a like a lion's den and the next one when he came the angle was lame my relaxing on a lion why the pool of fire came down brother you see when you stand for God God stains for you I wrote here brother Isaac that you know

and your oldest hands you begin to guide him he said well that's what God does when we form and make mistakes he don't beat us he says come on child I know you can walk I know you can overcome that trial I know you came in in love enough I know you can be set free many old friends and he guides you oh you need to walk with Jesus we need to stop walking with one another we become cleaners in the church I'm only with this group and I'm only with that group brother there shouldn't be no clinician asleep it's a spirit man because now we clannish me only with that group and we leave the poor ones

call and says come on come over to my house and have a cup of tea but we become klemish we only hang out with that group [Applause] right for others we have our circle of friends and only them but the down-and-outs we don't worry brother it's time we go to the down-and-out they the ones that love God they the ones that has an experience and you are knowing them positively you don't speak about the church you don't speak about the power you speak about that God then change your life and the miracle that happened that's what we do brother hallelujah then he says now Christ did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life and brought us back to eternal fellowship now the picture change yes the second hand of now but now he dies for a purpose because man was out of fellowship but now he brings him back into fellowship and he calls the eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall now the picture changes the second enemies on the other hallelujah the same logos that breed Adam brutally and they fell then God so men can come back so this God he said Oh someone Samia he says so many men wants to be a God like Buddha and Kansas can you can read all about them they want to be gods I know someone in Johannesburg they want to be God but listen there was only one God that want to be man there was only one man one God that wannabe like you and me and he became our kinsman redeemer that's why he understands when you ever hit it he understands when you greet through your trial he understands your burning in your heartaches and your sorrow one God becoming man [Applause] you know one of the purposes the funeral of name remember when the lady was coming in thus only son had died promises he was standing in the well he said about that day and I headache Christ so he knows what it is every addict he became human flesh he became like you and I Josh so he understands our pain he bears with you because you his son he's not gonna throw you away it's like but all you said even if that son is a drunkard he's thrown your son I can't disown him is my son if I have to go pick him up with the Sabine I go because it's my son oh you know the story makes me so emotional to think that God came down to our level put on skin become like you and me so he could suffer in and feel the pain of death and the agony and what he went through because he was God becoming man when I think of all the men that want to be God oh man forget it I don't want the God of flesh like that man I want the God of heaven that bears with me that understands me when I'm going through my trial in my test when I'm at my lowest he knows how to encourage me he knows how to love to me up he knows how to deliver me and set me free when I'm bound by alcohol and I'm bound by habits and I'm bound by pornography and lust and all the things of the world he knows how to set me free he's a kinsman redeemer and new back I don't get tonight you might be the lowest man my god will come my pain the gutters oh I said Wilson turn the dead my god TV Scott metal scrap metal brother and he moves each enemy melts it and he makes a beautiful masterpiece and you say said the same guy yes you wrote him open you demote but God goes back to her and lets up now I left this one I wanted to keep it for first but I wanted to bring forth before this first guy there was one guy in the Old Testament that found the secret and if you support us so you know whom I'm talking about and the Bible says he walked with God he walked with God every morning he caught up he walked with God he loved in the days of Noah but the fear was right reading brother and says his name is Enoch and Enoch was Noah's grandfather can you imagine so he knew when anak was raptured then oh I begin with a hug and he says Noah was a type of the Jews but Enoch he found the secret and when he found the secret how to walk with God God says I better take him I better take this man because if more people is going to find out more people will be raptured but you see he had to fulfill that type because he was a seven from oh my he was the seventh from enema and he walked with God he found the secret how to walk with God and God says one day while he was walking his feet he'd the Kings Highway and he just kept walking and he walked up into glory God says come on come on you know come come come come I don't want them to find them I don't want them to find the secret and in the permit say come on in up on the pyramid so he put every secret every monthly in there so he knocked new in you I'll do walk with God oh yes something beautiful man and in a walk with God at his feet he the keys our way and it just took him home you know he's the type of the pride and he was raptured and so will the sky be raptured one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9:00 they say about Enoch they say you know he was he says you know he was for God and God took him Genesis 5:24 that's why didn't wanna read it because I kept it the original Hebrew meaning for walk implies of Enoch went to and fro with God continually conversing with him and growing concerti now we always think you know when I yell you know the pitch in my mind I almost thought he was in the armored some weather it's easy then if he's living in a cave on the mountain someone then it's easy but yet what they say they say he continually converse with him growing trusting in him we see a new kind of believer he walked arm-in-arm every day with the Lord the Lord was his very life so much so that the end of his life he did not taste death but he was translated out of this life Hebrews 11:5 inoculant to walk pleasingly before God in the mass of a wicked society so Enoch wasn't separated he was right defines the people and the Bible says like it was in the days of Noah so that maybe Enoch loved in the days of Noah when they were eating drinking keeping in marriage that's a tiny love tea but he found the secret how do walk with God he'd wake up in the morning is a good morning father I'm ready to take a walk with you and but they say I mean Hamlisch through the man come on give us bride he's gonna be like you know you know what I mean I was born you're gonna find the secret your consciousness is coming back how to get to that level I feel a shot on me man you know you better come over before someone else finds that secret and brother Theo says that that vision is for a time so take him home and in the end time after many many years yet comes Malachi for and it is us the revelation how to walk with God how do we change if you take those seven unknown thunders to give the bride rapture in faith it will show her how to go it will prepare it will be a revival people say what's happening now the rap Jimmy faith is preparing you for the rapture come on young people I know what you something I'm watching you I want Union feet now I'm speaking of the blind I'm speaking about you you better be on fire for God man you know every pass this burden is for the young people and you think we waste time to come here and preach we tired we weary lots of money to get here but every time we come here we want to say something that will help you set you free and pull you out of the world hallelujah so he found a way he says ordered man with all the same problems same burdens we carry not the Hermit hidden away in the world in escape he was involved in life with a wife children obligations and undertook all his responsibilities so he wasn't a man our part he loves like the Monday a wife children all these responsibilities and obligations he undertook he cared for his family he worked the monastery occupied but he was not earthbound [Applause] come on now we're coming home to many of us he said Bamba though we eat in our tent pegs too deep we want this and once we wear that we want that and once you have that we know you put in your pegs too deep don't become a volume of promises this journey you don't back in you back out back out back out the damage back out then that burdens all those troubles that caught you trouble backing out you don't need anything there's already prepared hallelujah there's also ready for you [Music] [Applause] but oh but they didn't see my house yet hallelujah you must see mine on the other side you might have seen the street I'm gonna love him and you better get there man brother and sister I'll go with you brother over and brother all who we fellowship for ten thousand years and it looked like you was gone just a second [Applause] heaven is real wanna go with me coming go with me to my father's house hallelujah none of the demands of his life could keep him from his walk with God in this spirit so that's beautiful nothing kept him bound though he was the earth man with all the obligations we have yet he knew how to get lighter Enoch was was not a part of this wicked world each day as he walked with the Lord he became less attached to the things below like Paul and itay me to this earthly life and he was taken up in his spirit to a heavenly realm and all around Enoch mankind grew increasingly ungodly yet as men change into wild beasts full of lust hardness and sensuality Enoch became more and more like the one with whom he walked oh don't you want to walk with Him oh you're the one speaking don't you wanna walk with me instead of walking with those friends that's leading you away from God you beginning to dress like them you beginning to look like them you begin to smell like the world Egyptian hairstyles Egyptian clothing the world is slowly kill opinion and you cooling off and you don't even know it but it's in okay the revelation the more he was living like that the more later he became so it was easy for him to be rapture the lighter you become brother sister and you have less of the speeds of the world sisters are you you me you have less of the things of the world you don't want to look like your friend at work no I want to look like Jesus I'm a daughter of God I wanna be a son of God I don't want this Egyptian hairstyles no you know became more like the one that whoever walked so we had no Bible no songbook no fellow member no teacher no he's dwelling holy spirit yet Enoch knew God we have so many people around us we have wonderful pastors it manases the word in a week in okay nobody nobody and yet he became untouched but you see they had to be one in the Old Testament to type the bride in the new to say so then I realize but though there was someone they found the secret of how to get out of here and when God saw no he says no you know come come come you you better come home and he took him home one of these bones we need 69 you're gonna eat the king's highway all and every phone in why aren't you at work between six and nine but it's not that working but it's not at home also and I'm trying him on his cell phone now his cell phone is in the car he just disappeared no he didn't disappear he was raptured she was raptured and I'm just coming for you in me there's a promise of God and over you and you gonna be raptured [Applause] brother ben says a man can source of God then I'll tell the devil don't know what to do with it you know when you've gone your knees up the devil is in trouble he way you wake up in the morning you're on your knees it's always a wicked game always play McCain the devil the devil shakes when he sees that he's shaking tonight I'm telling you because spirits have been exposed and he's got the people bound but don't night they going free they're gonna be here they're gonna be delivered they're gonna be set free do you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back brother Olu to the eternal fellowship watch now this time its eternal fellowship so God can't lose you he can't save you today and you know he's gonna lose you no he can't so it's eternal fellowship and you might backslide and be in the world and make mistake you find it goes right after you in the Sabinas right after you you find out you something next to the guy in the guy say but aren't you in the message what are you doing here right let's go come on man you can run but you can't hide there's the Holy Spirit that's on your track and it's gonna get you oh I don't go too long there's so much there that I got you on Christ how we try to clean the church that he might live in and have fellowship with his heart is greater for fellowship than ours so God is closer than your right arm you think God is far from you brother says is right closer than your right arm it's right in your heart don't get tired I'm gonna close you know I'm gonna skip a lot of things and I want to wind up I want to show you here that we going back to Eden and we had I eaten conditioned on the earth and God had to demonstrate it before we leave to show there's a harvest coming and they will be the same [Applause] hallelujah I want you to stand I want everyone to stand I want you to listen to this please young people do me a favor you're not doing it for me yet God sees us and I'm skipping a lot of things and I'm going to write to the right to that to an Eden condition because Romans 8:26 for the creature was made subject to vanity God knew you can afford the creature was made such a growl to fall there's nothing you can do God knew it but he knew in your heart is the same term that's why when it comes to predestination he says not even your own choosing no man can come to the Father unless my father draws him so it's not even your own choice I have the codec okay then he says how there's something beyond the veil yonder that pulls a Christian he can't explain it he doesn't understand it himself but there is something in that fellowship that he was with Christ that's why Christ in John 7 is his father he says I want them to be where we are that was his desire you want that fellowship with you he says Lord can they be will I am and let them be one like you on Iowa you see so God wants fellowship and you don't give him enough fellowship and that's why we have less prayers answered the more we're gonna healed ourselves he says sister do the dishes quickly and once it's done go back to he says where's those old mothers that used to pre-conviction upon their children I'm gonna give a short test when I preach in New York brother promo and and I said it before and turn the dead how that when they sold brother Evans car and brother been rented brave brother Evans told him and he says don't worry brother Evans are going pray and it search for him and he saw the man driving the car going all the way down and then he said I sent the enforces the Holy Ghost after that man and while he was driving - all the way all of a sudden in the car comes conviction the man to his place she makes a u-turn any rights back and he leaves the carcass to the place and he starts running away you leave the keys everything brother Brennan comes out to play said brother Evans I found the car he said everything is in it says the petrol is down but the keys and everything and I know it is but I don't wanna ever see still in the car then I say this this in the meat you know I said night God will go after a motor car and bring it back how much more our children brother then he's back swimming in the world we can we must speak their names man speak their names God will bring them back that cloud there might not be a tire lift that might not be a standing we left of the car but then soul your child will be for eternity man [Applause] and I said that and answer only goes begin to pour out I begin to exalt and I say mother speak your child's name call his name when the Holy Ghost was pointing out and and brother brother was saying his wife was standing next to the sister and she said Lord Joseph Joseph Lord I'm calling my name and speaking his name chosen was in the service watch it now you you young people listen Joseph was right in the service a enemy told him he's an alcoholic 35 years old he said then leave the service I go for a drink and he says he walked out of the church anyone's going to buy a pint of vodka but he says since the promises she stood next to his mother and while I was in something I said speak his name speak her name and she was Saint Joseph from Joseph Lord you know what happened he walked the woman approached and all of a sudden here come the Holy Ghost just turn around go back brother you speaking of present tense I'm speaking of present tense man present tense Redemption and then he came in the wall but that time I gave the service to Joey jr. I seen this young man come honey Nina and he went to brother blowpro pray for me I had enough God is gonna corner you somewhere God is on your track man he's gonna quote me off he's gonna bring conviction O'Neal you might be elegant you might be disobedient but there's a cop that's on your track there's godly parents playing man this godly pastors praying now why because she's a child of God you not a child of this world and I seen him walk he didn't going straight to Rome with his brother Bellomo I had enough I'm finished you see right there the Holy Spirit went after him convicted him and turn him back you can pray conviction on your children don't give up on them call the name speak the names wherever they are I don't care what they doing I hope I'll be bound but God is able to turn them around God is able to deliver them God can make a lady out of a gentleman bring him in also God and if he worshipping God and praising God brother man says you know these people in hell would like to have your seat young people people in Hell would like to have another chance in have your seat and you taking things for granted [Applause] be careful man hallelujah oh my so much so much the three full purpose brother Alleluia quoted it and it says the thirdly is to restore the kingdom to its rightful position they fell by Sun by the first element back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people he talked with him fellowshipped what wouldn't today God hasn't promised the fellowship through the Methodists or through the Baptist's through the Pentecost he promised fellowship in Christ Jesus that's where your fellowship is hallelujah and brotherman says God was lonely lonely but he'll never be lonely again because his attributes are made manifest now he has fellowship and these are some mixed audience my son Luke was in my loins but I couldn't fellowship with him until he was expressed then he came and I held him as a baby and I cooled and I spoke and you know the baby language how beautiful that is but now he's expressed well the same with God he couldn't do it but now you express but the secret is you mustn't just let God make love to you you must make love back to the locals saying on I love you I thank you for my healing I thank you for my deliverance make love back to the logos don't just stand there all dead so the dead know I'm alive that's right the Jews when they pray at the wall you see the movie and they asked the Jew why do you worship like that he says because in case Jehovah think I'm a dead shucks he might just rub me out but I move like that to show him I'm alive I'm alive tonight I worship Him I wanna show him I worship Him I'm alive so you gotta make love back to the logos or his broody oh I'm coming to this naw I'm

disciples to you also wanna go God will beg you don't you also want to go then Peter said those blessed words brother Channel where can we go Lord this message alone is the words of eternal life where can we go more we can't go to no Pentecostal Church to no man but this message has the words of eternal life [Applause] and then he says here watching ah so he said now that is true and when I meet you at the judgment I have all this to answer for he said and I said stone you go to your place stop and Sun you shine normally for four days now he has a man like you and me you know the thing of brother Branham he you know Adam I can understand he was created flesh Jesus I can understand he was God it's fresh but yes the man that creep through a holy wedlock and will mix or desire sex but God is speaking to man like you and me now Sooey he can't dwell in these bodies that came by son so don't number caught tonight don't love him even if he must speak to a dog he did speak through a donkey man [Applause] he said Nana said said stone go to your place stop son you shine normally for four days and no more then I said that the sleet and the hail and which was about to blow me down just stopped and within a moment or two the Sun was shining light down through upon me and I looked down across the mountain and I could see the East Wing come and I could see the wind was coming from the west and east wind coming and it was coming this way and I could see the clouds just mysteriously where they went and where they went I don't know so he saw the wind coming but he saw it returning he saw the clouds but all of a sudden it's a reversal in its green back and now he already spoke the word and here comes the Sun out I want you to hear this this is what I'm coming to and I stood there a few moans tears running down my through my beard then gray and I thought God I don't know what to do man this made me so emotional when I read it and I spoke I started walking down the mountain and the snow was drying up the hot Sun steam coming out of my shirt just a moment or two difference and I started walking down the mountain and when I did now yeah I'm coming he says I heard a voice and say why don't you walk with me Oh God have mercy man but only the God of heaven asking a human being why don't you walk with me he forgot about the storm is on his way back he's now walking back and yet the voice says look how God wants fellowship he says don't you want to walk with me and tonight I can almost hear the voice of God thundering out don't you want to walk at me young person young man mother father you walked on your own you walked in your own way but don't you want to walk with me even condition he said the voice said why don't you walk with me I said Lord the greatest privilege I ever had he says and I turned and I started back down through the big deer trailers down through the virgin forest he says in a walk down way well always pay a salute to me to my wife and I was going along there some about a half an hour three quarters later snow was all dried up watch and it was gone standing aside this tree and the tears dropping down my eyes and I thought God just think the same God that said peace be still - the waves and the wings of bathing Easter the same Jesus and it's right here in the woods with us and I say he's here in the meeting tonight the same Jesus that can speak to your storm into your ways into your own situation he can say peace peace tongue let there be no more disappointments and discouragement he will speak to your storm but you must say Lord it will be a privilege to walk with you [Music] oh my he still the same Jesus right in the woods what does he thought the word the word all nature has to pay his word for he's the creator of nature and I stood there and tears was running down my cheeks and I heard something go even brother Brennan knocks on the proper day and I look standing right before me watch watch knock don't you want to walk with me so he says the same Jesus that said peace be still was right in the woods he says in the next best thing when I opened my eyes he says yo ya was two or three deers right before me
