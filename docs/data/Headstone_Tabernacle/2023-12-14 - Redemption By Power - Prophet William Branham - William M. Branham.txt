Amen brother Shan thank you God bless you so you may be seated praise God thought here on the on the 11th verse and thus shall you eat it with your listen to this L GED I like that shoes on your feet staff in your hand you shall eat it a it's the L's Passover I like that while you're eating and be ready to go that's the issue let's turn over to Ephesians about the sixth chapter Ephesians and looking here what Paul said about getting the church ready sixth chapter Ephesians beginning at the 14th verse of the sixth chapters stand therefore having your La GED about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all things take the shield of Faith where with you shall be able to quench the fiery Dart of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God see Paul's dressing up a man for the battlefield for the March God and beginning delivering of Israel he said now you want to get ready for the March when you come the blood put on your shoes GT up your lawn get your staff in your hand and get ready for the call I like that a man now when he comes into Christ he gets his gospel shoes on just preach the gospel the helmet of salvation ons the breastplate of righteousness GS up these laes they usually in the old Soldiers when they put on those ornaments of War they had a big belt that buckled it together holding over their lawn these shields to keep the enemy Spears off what a real lesson that is to us and when the the LA begin to get weak hang down the shield that heighten up on the Val bring him up tight again what a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're slacking her the devil says is no use reach down and tighten up the Bell a little bit pull up the sword little tight in the hand go forward I like that be ready for the March every man walking under that blood that night was commanded to stay there not go out until the orders come to March and every man is born of the spirit of God comes into Christ has everlasting life puts on his shield his breastplate standing ready and forbidden to leave until orders to Mark oh isn't it marvelous aren't you glad you got it all harnessed up tonight youed cers used to have a song leader at the Tabernacle a theme song was to fight his own old Christian soldiers face to face in stery with armor gleaming color streaming the right and Wrongs engaged today the fight is on but be not weary be strong and in his might whole fast if God be far far we'll sing the Victor song At Last many of them old Saints has gone to the grave but one of these days Yonder in a new world when they come forth into the promised land the banner of the Cross will be over us and we'll sing the Victor song when we said at the wedding supper that night around the table that great table maybe 100,000 miles long with the blood was F sitting around there I want to go down on the table and shake hands with every one of them amen just shouting you want to hear me shout wait till get over there watch me I ain't big enough yet for this first notice on the March now get ready we're going here's a sad picture before we get over to a regular lesson is found in the 38th verse there listen and amidst multitude went up with their flock that is where Israel made a mistake the supernatural had been done and unconverted people followed because of the supernatural finally got him into trouble and on down we not sh about the 42nd verse in the 43rd verse the Lord speaking to Moses said that no one but those who were sacrificed could eat the sacrifice brother but those who were circumcised no strangers no Outsiders no one should take it but those who are circumcised and what is this grace that we have today in this day beloved friends that when in the church everybody that belongs to the church takes communion and that's wrong only those who are redeemed that's all who are worthy Isaiah spoke and said the tables of the Lord would be full of vomits said who canot teach Doctrine them that are wean from the breath said precept must be up precept line up line here little and there little and hold fast to that one's good God speaking knowing that the day that we're living in that the church would be so politically till we let every s people come in long as they had their name on the church books they were members they taken communion and the Bible said he that eats and drinks it unworthy is guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord St John 13th chapter Jesus speaking 2 Corinthians 11 chapter Paul said years later that he that eats and drinks this unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord let a man examine himself he says before I'm quoting scripture that's right he that eats and drinks unworthy eats and drinks damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are sick and weakly among you and many sleep be sure that you're standing right with God here it is in the shadow that no one but the circumcised no matter how work how much he helped the Jewish church he had to be a PR had to be a real circumcised believer before he could take the communion or he the Passover oh how far we got off the line today now let's go quickly then and God Dr in out tonight we're turning now to the 13th verse of the 14th chapter God gave him the pillar of fire to go before them I think they had a picture here tonight and I say it with reverence to my honest opinion while we're here in this group tonight I believe that is with us tonight the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel is going for performing the same times and morning and any teacher here or scholar of the Bible knows that the angel that followed Israel and guided them to the promised land was the angel of the Covenant which was Jesus Christ and today Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is falling before this group that you want to call Holy rulers if you want to are going on leading from Victory onto Victory praise Dro in them nations in them days they were despised and hated and rejected and turned down by the Nations and call everything so is it today with the True Believer you in your churches you know when you take a stand for Christ and speak for truth the whole church says look at him he's lost his mind he's gone crazy don't pay no attention to that call along you're all honored up now the blood's going before you the Holy Spirit leading you just keep moving don't pay attention what nobody tell you look take the calvary and March on beautiful typ now they had come out to the God and now notice blood Redemption brought them out of Egypt now they had to have something else now to take them on over into the land now they're just beginning to start they come out been circumcised come under the blood and on the March now they got up to something there is going along there knowing that it passed from death into life no they had eternal life but there they are coming up now and difficult begins to rise Here Comes ph's Army pursuing them to take them trouble set in listen God is our refuge our strength a very present help in time of trouble oh I hope you see this here it is no listen 13th now and Moses said unto the people fear ye not I love that after Jesus rose the dead his words were CAU me fear not that's what the trouble of the church today is scared to death you're going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in Christ you can't fail you got everlasting life all demons in hell can't take you you got Everlasting life Jesus said so so don't be scared of failure you say well I'm pray I get fanatic I go have a little fanaticism and sit still

Long Fellow there tell me not in mournful numbers life is but a denty dream and the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they see but yes life is real and life is earnest and the grave is not its goal just our heart to dust return is not spoken of the Soul let us be up and doing with our heart for any side be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero don't wait for people to persuade you to Christ hand like a man or lady accept him and walk forward in Victory amen that's what God wants rugged ready soldiers you might not be weigh 105 lbs but you can still be Rudy brother and full of power if you'll just let God have his way I've seen man that weigh 200 lb didn't have an ounce of man in him that's right all right notice Moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see

speak to the children of Israel that they go forward I like that don't try to say say well I joined the church 10 years ago brother Brandon I've been a good faithful member that's fine I appreciate that but let's move on tonight God's moving on the people today here they go back they say well now signs 150 years ago there was a science in France that said if a man ever went the terrific speed of 30 m hour gravitation take him off the Earth andd be gone 30 m an hour going about 1,600 miles hour now you never hear science refer back to that fell he was all right this day but they're living in another day that's right but we preachers all know Divine Healing now let me see what what St Moody finny Knox Calvin some of them said about it they were all right in their days but we're moving on going forward we got something else Jesus said in the parable there are the stor when the store went forth and sold seeds and some the enemy come around sold some weeds in the wheat he said let them grow together you're always pointing how Wicked the world are getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is get at the same time she's rising up ping on her feet oh she's a little SL bre God's with her and she's going to Triumph This is C Christ Ro come today amen God's Church shall never fail the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it shall they be against it but they cannot Prevail the church is going to Triumph to the blood of Jesus Christ to the victory march I'm positive of this one thing that God will have a church without toop wrinkle our blemish amen I'm so happy about that now if I am in that church Amen brother BR how do you get into it by letter no how do you get into it by birth borned into it I've been in the Brandon family it be 45 years the sixth day of this coming April and they never did ask me to join their family I was born to Brandon I'll always be a brand I find a Christian in Jesus Christ I'll be a Christian because God has ordained us so by election he called us to the grace of his own beloved Son we accepted him and got eternal life by one handshake by one membership by one letter by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body Jesus Christ and there become fellow citizens of of the Kingdom I was thinking today as I was away praying and how that this is the day that we're going to have to answer for I'm not going to have to answer for the generation that was before me or the generation that will be after me but in the Judgment I'm to stand with this generation now I said look at there a woman's picture on the sign beer drinking something other said she was breathless or something I said guess in life let's do all right there you are I said what a disgrace of all the preaching I said sometimes it seems that told my wife I said sometimes it seems it doesn't do any good but I've got to be the voice of warning anyhow regardless of what people does about it I got to preach the gospel anyhow and give a witness unto the resurrection and the power of Jesus Christ let them forsake it and turn their back Garf will judge them at the Judgment part I'm only responsible for preaching and other ministers too who preach the gospel now I just love it notice go farther now and you will see the glory of God but listen the 16th verse now we read this but lift up the rod the rod that was a judgment Rod now it wasn't Moses Rod that was God's rod if you notice Moses he took that Rod he held it up like this please come he held it over the waters to turn to blood it was God's judgment rod and that same Rock get it that same Rod is what he smoked the rock with and a c come in the side of the Rock and Waters came out of the rock now that rock was Christ and it was God's judgment the day you eat there that day you die smoke Christ to calary and paid that bitter agonizing death no man never could describe what it was or never will there God placed all the Divine judgment upon on him and smot him in the side when out of his side come water and blood and spirit for Redemption how pained picturetime with a robe around him or something other on the cross that is not so they dispose that man of every fou vulgar thing that they could but he had to be there he was the highest and loest of all the world that ever was or will be and it exposed naked on the cross wounded smitten bleeding SC Moy spits hanging from his face a mock crown of thorns on his head but there is when he conquers death hell sin sickness and the grave and paid the price for us all it's often said sometimes there where he took the S out of death that's where Paul said Old Death where is your sting I've been told that many insects bees and things they got a singer and they're poison with it but one time and they sing they lose their sing just had a sing it at one time but Christ don't C the singer out of death hallelujah oh think of it there he pulled a singer out of death for me and you all the sting of death Paul said when he go to cut his head off in the Roman prison he said de where is your s pointed back to Calvary there where Stinger was taken out of death three where is your victory said but thanks be to God he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen all right the rod the judgment and stretch it out cover this the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go over on drrive ground through the midst of the sea and I behold I will harden the heart of the Egyptians and they shall follow thee and I will get the honor upon pharaoh and upon all his host and upon the Chariots and upon the Harshman and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord and I have gotten me honor upon pharaoh and upon his charot and of only Authority and the angel of God listen tighten up the harness now and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel he's still here the angel of God that went before the camp of Israel removed and went back behind them and the pillar of the crowd went from before their face and stood be them are went up from here and stood back here a go between in a time of trouble when trouble Begins the F you sickness on the every hand trouble the angel of God comes up rolles out between you and the sickness and stands there away a challenging you to take God's word God had give Israel the promise that they was going to the Land There was a Millions probably of man coming to pursue them and run them down and chop them down like a bunch of animals but the angel of the Lord who was there to carry them to the promised land rose up from the camp and wi stood between them and danger Hallelujah he still he makes the way I just love him for that don't you he'll make the way for every sick person setting you right now he's already made the way and he's standing between you in trouble and I I know he's here right now you can call me a fanatic if you want to I'm not responsible for what you say but I'm responsible for what I say before God but he who L the children of Israel if I have just sit right on that light that you see tonight or seen on that picture I suppos up out tonight that same angel of God is in this building right now to do just exactly what Jesus did in that day he shared to confirm just what he did then he is now and will always be the same the angel of God moving up to stand between us and sickness stand between us and death no wonder David said I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll Fe evil for th with me stand there the angel of God went before the camp of Israel and removed and went and stood between them and the enemy and the angel of God Is Standing tonight between every individual here and the enemy I know I'm speaking of I know why standing here now on the platform before this little group of people tonight I know that God has come coming down from glory and standing in this building now if you only dare to move out on God's word see if he don't move before you watch and it came between the camp and the Egyptians he's coming between you and your sickness he's standing between you and your sins right now why we are in The Exodus of the church Egypt was always called the world and when Israel come out up remember they were church members down there but after the blood and the atonement was made they become the circumcised of God and the circumcision today is the baptism of the holy spirit all said Stevens All You uncircumcised and the heart and ears why do you always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did to you the Holy Spirit circumcised the heart cutting away the things of the world it used to be the oldfashioned Hol in this church lived I could like it live like it but today it's just like the rest of the world it's a disgrace we let down the bars old brother Spurgeon used to say an old Methodist preacher friend of mine used to sing a song we let down a bar we let down a bar we compromise with sin we let out of bars the Sheep got out how did the goats get in because you lay down the bars that's it you lay down the standard of Christian Living because the Seminary ped out a few preachers and set them down to compromise with the truth but the Holy Ghost has always been there to conem sin it is tonight pending between the believer and the things of the world Amen and it came between the camp and the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud of Darkness to them but it gave Life by night to the so that the one came not near the other all night look the same thing that was given this group of Believers light was blind and man all put on your shot jacket here it comes every man that rejects life goes v and walks in darkness because you don't accept light amen God sends ministers and preach the gospel he sends times and wonders among men to vindicate it to be the truth and man rejected there's nothing left but Darkness for you walk in the light while the light is shining my brother receive the light Christ is the light he's come to bring life to you but those who rejected light receive darkness and every man and woman tonight who reject light walks in darkness not knowing where he's going he's staggering along pretty good popular with the people but wonder how he stands in the presence of God notice that what a marvelous thing here he was light to one and darkness to the other the Israelites and after Moses pray they could lay down and PE now watch and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all that night and made the sea a dry land and the waters were divided and the children of Israel went unto the midst of the sea upon the dry ground if you'll notice while the children of Israel who had come out of darkness and accepted the light when they got in trouble the light turned back around and they slept all night and while they were sleeping God was sending a wind blowing down across the sea opening up a way of Escape Hallelujah to the lamb I'm so glad that I've been filled with the Holy Spirit tonight w we are sleeping rejoicing resting in the promise of God God promised them to make a way of escape and while they were resting on This Promise God was down there before them opening up a way every man and woman tonight that will accept Jesus Christ on those grounds the Holy Spirit why are you Streep while you're arresting in this promise maybe you're a crippled maybe you're a blind maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer something dying except for life tonight and rest upon it and the wind's coming like a Russian Mighty Wind on the day of Pentecost will move down to that and open up a way for you Hallelujah that you'll pass right through that Valley of sickness right back into the land of Health again you'll TI right that land of cold formal shackle town in different religions to a holy ghost fill happy rejoicing Heart full of choice God shows his power and was showing excuse me I'm getting too loud showing Redemption by power he showed the blood back down one thing he showed his power here by his blood to Redemption showed his power to escape death through the blood he showed his power to make a way of Escape by Redemption of power and today you who have accepted amen you who have accepted the brother of Jesus Christ to cleanse you from sin the power of the Holy Ghost is here to lead you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the power of God is here to transform you from sickness to Hell God moving on in The Exodus of the church she's coming into the blossom where God will get her at to hly Green Wonder coming out of the darkness into the marvelous life how we love that how I do what that means to my soul tonight friends you I talking to a man today who just met me while I was out and he said I've been trying to tell people said I've changed you lot Billy since you was a kid said you used to come by and tell me at my place of business that I ought to get right with God I ought to be right with God and said I TI laugh at you but said Billy things have changed now said I know now what you speak of praise God he said I'll try to tell others about it said they'll change the subject and go talk about a funny paper or something I eat me this next hour a corner he may die he's the next one maybe his number is next and not knowing whose number is next it may be yours tonight friends this may be the time God called you God the great Holy Spirit standing here tonight between death and life standing here tonight between sickness and health I know what I speak of that's right right now the same holy spirit that you feel are every Born Again person's bound to feel that spirit in the room you can't help it amen if you got any life you know it's there all right how like a magnet the great magnets coming near the material it begins to move and crawl W poer gets like a big magnet come down up here one time in Hamond Indiana I was watching take up shavings on the floor they pulled a great big lever down come a great big magnet they had all the shavings swept out in the middle of the floor and as it passed by all those shavings that was magnified to the magnet iron went right up and went with the magnet out they demagnetized it dropped it into the cupid and molded it again there's a lot of aluminum shavings left I said why didn't they go he said they're not magnetized to the magnet I said praise God I said why didn't these go down here the CE iron so if you no is boled down that's about like a lot of peoples tonight friends you become a church member but not magnified by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you let something shackle you down some different shackle you down but one of these days there's a great magnet coming from the East called the Son of God that'll sweep this land and every person that D CH r at to go down these old body will be transformed and made like us into his own glorious body for we

world has your religion got anything that would clean the hands of Lady makabe nobody said a word he jumped up in the air and kicked his he together sat his T he said the blood of Jesus Christ won't

lord Jesus here in his love and Power in his great empty blessings oh how he stands between the church and sin tonight how he stands between you and judgment beding playing you're not long go I walk into a place up here in Ohio where I've been just about to pass my opinion of judgment I've been eating in a little junkard restaurant was having a great meeting I had to stay several miles out in the country at a little Motel I've been eating in a dunker restaurant nice lovely people and on Sunday they closed and went to church I had to go across an ordinary little common American place to eat my dinner when I walked into the door to my surprise there stood a state police with his arm around a girl playing the slot machine now gambling is illegal in Ohio and there a law man himself breaking the law and perhaps a man at my age perhaps married to the family somewhere with his arms around some young lady sitting there I look back across the restaurant some boys sitting back there drunking a young lady not acting morally at all I look sitting down to my right side here to a booth which I was ready to sit down there said an elderly lady somewhat around 58 60 years old old as my mother setting there her skin all wrinkled up the little bitty clothes on all was turble and her toenails painted purple lips painted purple the horest looking s you ever seen her hair cut real short and Fram St like that and she was drinking that's the two men with her sitting there horribly looking drunk one of them laying across the place of the table and when they excused themselves and went out to the restroom I said there I thought oh God how can you stand it how can you look at such as that when even in my heart and I'm as bad as I am it's still I wonder of my little SAR and Rebecca have to raise up in such a generation to see that coming on Lord why don't you just wipe it off the face of the Earth why don't you just do it Lord I sat down there and just started weeping I saw evasion I saw as it was the world whirling around in the air and there stood a rainbow around that world and someone that was speaking to me said that's the blood of Jesus Christ around this world that keeps him from destroyed if God can see sand the day you eat there of that day you die every man under that blood there has is a free moral agent to take your choice but if you ever die and your soul sares beyond the mercy of that blood you're already judged before you get there there's nothing left for you then I seen myself I seen my Lord Jesus standing there with a crown of thorns on his head and the
