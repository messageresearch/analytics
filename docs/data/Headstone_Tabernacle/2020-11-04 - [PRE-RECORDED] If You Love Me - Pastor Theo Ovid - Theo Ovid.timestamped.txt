[20:17] he that loved me shall be loved of my
[20:20] father and i will love him and will
[20:22] manifest myself to him now judas said
[20:25] unto him not his carrot lord how is it
[20:27] that thou would manifest thyself unto us
[20:29] are not unto the world and jesus went to
[20:32] explain
[20:33] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[20:34] man loves me he will keep my words and
[20:37] my father will love him and we will come
[20:40] unto him and make our board with him
[20:43] he that love it
[20:45] me not
[20:46] keep it not my sins
[20:49] and the word which you hear is not mine
[20:51] but the fathers which sent me
[20:54] these things have i spoken unto you
[20:56] being present with you but the comforter
[20:58] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[21:01] will send in my name he shall teach you
[21:03] all things and bring all things to your
[21:05] remembrance whatsoever i have said unto
[21:08] you i returned to matthew chapter 21 we
[21:10] want to read from verse 23.
[21:19] and when he had come unto the temple the
[21:21] chief priest and the elders of the
[21:23] people came under him
[21:24] as he was teaching
[21:26] and said
[21:27] by what authority does though
[21:31] by what authority does doubt these
[21:33] things and who give thee this authority
[21:37] and jesus answered and said unto them i
[21:39] also will ask you one thing
[21:41] which if you tell me
[21:43] i and likewise will tell you by what
[21:46] authority i do these things the baptism
[21:48] of john whence was it from heaven
[21:51] or of men
[21:52] and they reason within themselves with
[21:55] themselves saying if we shall say from
[21:57] heaven he will say unto us why did he
[21:59] not then believe him
[22:00] but if we shall see of men we fear the
[22:02] people for all whole john as a prophet
[22:06] and they they answered jesus and said we
[22:08] cannot tell
[22:09] he said unto them neither would tell i
[22:11] you by what authority i do these things
[22:13] but what think he a certain man had two
[22:16] sons and he came to the first and said
[22:19] son go work today into my vanguard and
[22:22] he answered and said i will not
[22:23] but afterwards he repented and went and
[22:26] he came to the second and said likewise
[22:28] and he said answered and said i go sir
[22:30] and went not
[22:32] wither of them twain did the will of his
[22:34] father
[22:35] they said unto him the first
[22:38] and jesus said unto them verily i sent
[22:40] to you that the publicans and the hearts
[22:43] go into the kingdom of god before you
[22:46] for john came unto you in the way of
[22:48] righteousness and you believe him not
[22:51] but the publicans and the harlots
[22:54] believe him and ye when you have seen it
[22:57] repented not afterwards that you might
[22:59] believe him may god bless his word you
[23:00] may be seated oh this is the powerful
[23:02] scriptures tonight
[23:03] o praise the name of the lord
[23:06] blessed be the name of the lord you love
[23:07] him
[23:09] then sue them but the title tonight is
[23:11] if you love me
[23:15] that's what jesus said right
[23:18] he said it in in verse 15 of saint john
[23:21] 14. if you love me keep my commandments
[23:23] so i took the title from there if you
[23:25] love me
[23:26] and matthew 21 have a parable so our
[23:28] inspiration the will of the father
[23:30] and this is brother branham he was
[23:32] saying here
[23:33] dear jesus help us tonight in these two
[23:36] words as we wait upon thee and we pray
[23:38] that your grace and mercy will be with
[23:39] us lord and tend our hearts move back
[23:41] all the shocks the thorns the thistles
[23:44] let the blessed sunshine of god fall in
[23:47] upon the word lord and may we have such
[23:49] a great meeting until they'll not be an
[23:51] unsafe person among us all the children
[23:53] will be in the kingdom of god
[23:56] those without the baptism of the spirit
[23:59] may they receive it further
[24:01] may all the great mysteries that we are
[24:04] supposed to know at this age lord we
[24:06] reveal unveil to us
[24:08] that we
[24:10] that we will see the plainness of god
[24:14] so that we will know how to behave
[24:16] ourselves and act
[24:19] correcting ourselves and bringing the
[24:22] members of our body into the discipline
[24:25] to the word
[24:26] that we might know how to live in this
[24:28] present day at the approaching of the
[24:30] lord
[24:30] jesus christ
[24:37] so he said
[24:40] that the mystery we supposed to know
[24:43] may be unveiled
[24:45] and once it's unveiled it's to bring the
[24:48] word plain to us
[24:50] that god can be made known to you
[24:53] being made plain to you
[24:55] hear what for that we may know
[24:57] how to behave
[25:00] know how to talk
[25:02] how
[25:03] to
[25:04] behave
[25:06] so all the teachings and all the
[25:08] mysteries and all the revelation is to
[25:10] bring you and i into a behavior
[25:14] because talk is talk
[25:16] and the bible gave the parable of these
[25:18] two sons
[25:19] one said i will not
[25:21] and the other one say i will go sir the
[25:24] first son changes mine and went and do
[25:26] what was supposed to be done the second
[25:28] son said he's willing i'll go sir they
[25:30] talk and didn't do it
[25:32] which one did the will of the father
[25:35] and jesus busted those hypocrites he
[25:38] busted them and tell them them
[25:40] halats and prostitutes and all the kind
[25:42] of people they're gonna get in the
[25:43] kingdom of god before you
[25:46] because this is not a talking thing
[25:48] this is the walking thing
[25:50] you're not walking they're not talking
[25:51] now you have to walk the talk
[25:53] oh glory to god you have to walk in this
[25:56] light is that that talking thing is not
[25:57] a pulpit single teaching thing no you've
[25:59] got to come to on
[26:01] to conform yourself to the word of god
[26:04] if you love me
[26:06] keep my commandments
[26:08] not talk my commandments
[26:11] do i hear a shout in the house
[26:13] do i hear amen in the house
[26:15] you have to want to keep his
[26:16] commandments or you have to want to obey
[26:18] his word
[26:20] that means you coming into obedience of
[26:22] his word
[26:23] that means a committed obedience to his
[26:25] will and then the blessings of god begin
[26:27] to follow you
[26:29] oh glory to god because you're walking
[26:30] in god's will
[26:32] hallelujah do you believe that
[26:34] let's continue to be born of the spirit
[26:38] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[26:40] spirit
[26:41] to understand and believe in your heart
[26:43] that jesus is the christ
[26:45] and this is his word and no other words
[26:48] can be added to it or taken from it
[26:50] without your name taken out of the book
[26:52] of life
[26:53] that's a strong one if you add one think
[26:55] to it your tradition take from it you
[26:57] said well christ himself said your name
[26:59] shall be rubbed off the book of life no
[27:02] i was going to skip it i'll beat you now
[27:04] let me read it again to be born of the
[27:06] spirit
[27:07] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[27:10] spirit
[27:11] it's not you doing anything and you're
[27:12] doing your own thing and you're a
[27:14] christian no no believe and behave
[27:18] you believe the words you've got to
[27:19] behave yourself
[27:21] and that will show your bone of the
[27:23] spirit when you can believe and behave
[27:25] yourself in the spirit
[27:27] let's continue do you say you must be
[27:29] born again in order to be born again
[27:31] it's letting yourself go and die and the
[27:33] spirit of christ coming to you then you
[27:35] are no more yours it is christ in you
[27:38] the holy spirit paul said ideally yet i
[27:41] live you're not but christ live it in me
[27:43] oh praise god now if i told you the
[27:45] spirit of john delinquent will mean me
[27:47] i'll have guns and be an outlaw if i
[27:49] have told you that the spirit of an
[27:50] artist you expect me to paint the
[27:52] picture of an artist if i tell you i'm a
[27:54] christian and the spirit of christ is in
[27:56] me then we will do the works of christ
[27:59] jesus said in sin john he that believer
[28:01] to me the words that i do shall you do
[28:02] also no excuses
[28:04] no excuses the true church is saying
[28:07] mark 16 in action
[28:09] not in talking in action not an
[28:11] explanation in action in other words

[28:16] want to see it alive there must be a
[28:18] peace in your spirit there's a place in
[28:20] your soul for a manifested reality
[28:24] come on now come on i'll say amen
[28:26] glory to god did you get what i'm saying
[28:29] not for me to be explaining explaining
[28:31] and talking and talking no you must want
[28:33] another place in your heart for a
[28:35] manifested reality you want this word to
[28:38] come alive you want a dead man behind
[28:40] the pulpit you want people to die out
[28:42] you want to be surrendering to the lord
[28:44] death have a price that ever cost
[28:48] all glory to god you purge your own soul
[28:51] oh glory to god when god tells the
[28:53] prophet be more sincere he went and fast
[28:55] for three days because he was purging
[28:57] himself because god saw something in him
[29:00] that needed to come out
[29:01] oh give the lord i shout and when god
[29:04] looking at you you're going to see
[29:05] something in you you can see your
[29:07] neighbor business mind your own business

[29:18] oh
[29:19] hallelujah
[29:21] thank you lord
[29:27] i enjoy this what i'm about to share
[29:29] with you here now
[29:33] jesus is walking alone
[29:36] in the midst of his
[29:38] churches i am here that walk in the
[29:41] midst of the seven golden
[29:43] candlesticks
[29:46] there is no one else with him
[29:50] neither indeed can there be
[29:53] for he alone wrought her salvation
[29:56] and having purchased her with his own
[29:58] blood he owns her
[30:00] so you ain't belong to no man
[30:05] this nonsense the only the people is the
[30:08] pastor why some kind of foolishness tell
[30:10] you is that one wife i have like mary
[30:12] but about make a one reference and they
[30:14] kneel that down like a doctrine there
[30:16] goes our next church you should come
[30:16] adultery all kind of foolishness
[30:19] this is what he says here and when he
[30:22] talked to the angel by the device he
[30:23] said come here i will show you the bride
[30:25] the lamb's
[30:27] wife
[30:27] [Music]
[30:29] not some pasta wife the lamb's wife
[30:33] not some church why so you don't belong
[30:35] to no man you belong to god
[30:37] do you believe that
[30:39] he wrought he alone wrought her
[30:41] salvation and have having purchased her
[30:44] with his own blood he owns her
[30:46] he is her lord and master
[30:49] she gives him all the glory
[30:52] and that glory he will not share with
[30:54] another
[30:55] there is no pope with him
[30:58] there is no archbishop with him mary the
[31:00] mother of his earthly body buddy is not
[31:02] with him hallelujah
[31:06] he does not speak and turn to our father
[31:08] for he is the father he does not turn to
[31:11] give orders to the holy spirit for he is
[31:14] god
[31:15] the eternal spirit and it is his life
[31:18] that is flowing and pulsating in the
[31:21] church giving a life
[31:24] without him there will be no life
[31:26] or give the lord a shout
[31:29] no message pope
[31:31] no man of the hour
[31:33] or glory no pastor pope
[31:35] oh no bishop not by this one man all
[31:38] that nonsense is he alone
[31:41] walking in the midst of the
[31:44] church and that's why he said when we
[31:47] come back to them seven thunders it will
[31:48] be christ it omits him moving in and out
[31:52] and then you're worshiping the living
[31:54] christ

[37:47] [Applause]

[37:55] let me be seated
[37:56] hallelujah
[37:58] it is god in her
[38:00] willing and doing his good pleasure he
[38:04] said never forget that
[38:06] you have only one relationship to god
[38:09] and god has only one relationship to you
[38:13] that is jesus
[38:15] and jesus alone
[38:20] since jesus alone
[38:22] in the midst right
[38:23] let's continue now there is with seven
[38:26] stars
[38:27] in his right hand
[38:30] this jesus who is alone he have seven
[38:33] what
[38:34] stars in his right hand the right hand
[38:36] or arm signifies the power and authority
[38:40] psalms 44 3 for they got not the land
[38:43] and possession by their own sword
[38:45] neither did their own arms save them but
[38:47] thy right hand dynam and the light of
[38:49] thy countenance because favor unto them
[38:52] in that right hand of power our seven
[38:54] stars who according to revelation 120
[38:57] are the seven church messengers
[39:00] this signifies that the very power
[39:03] and authority of god are behind his
[39:06] messengers to every age
[39:11] these messengers are trying a thing
[39:15] these messengers are in his hand
[39:18] his power and authority is backing them
[39:20] up
[39:21] [Applause]
[39:21] [Music]
[39:24] so when you hear from these messengers
[39:26] you are hearing from the empowered
[39:28] authority of god
[39:30] coming through the mount of these
[39:31] messengers that's why they fought for to
[39:33] bring back every age they fought
[39:35] all glory to god because everybody have
[39:37] a word that was lost the world was
[39:39] divided through seven ages and to bring
[39:41] back the fullness of the holy ghost you
[39:43] have to bring back the fullness of the
[39:44] word so they have to come and guard all
[39:47] the words they're tied back in the world
[39:48] to bring down the holy ghost
[39:50] the object is to bring back power in the
[39:52] church god hates a powerless church
[39:57] come on preach now to me somebody
[39:59] god hates don't forget that he hates it
[40:08] he hates a powerless church
[40:11] the early church was a powerful church
[40:13] a church with jesus walking in it
[40:15] people
[40:16] god added to the church no man joined up
[40:19] to them
[40:20] oh glory to god because people are being
[40:22] judged in the church he people have been
[40:24] healed in the church oh glory to god and
[40:27] he said we're getting back to that
[40:29] we're coming right back to that god
[40:30] can't lie he said i am alpha and omega
[40:33] oh glory to god everything else in
[40:35] between but the same alpha anointing
[40:37] will come back on your omega anointing
[40:39] the same power that was in the early
[40:40] church community at alpha church
[40:43] omega church hallelujah are you with me
[40:47] they go forth with fire
[40:49] these messengers they go over the fire
[40:51] and power of the holy ghost with the
[40:52] word
[40:53] they are stars
[40:55] because they reflect light
[40:58] the light that reflects is his light
[41:01] they have no light on their own
[41:03] they kindle not their own fires that men
[41:06] may walk in the light of their sparks
[41:09] isaiah 50 11 it is night for that is
[41:12] when the stars come out it is night of
[41:14] blackness of sin for all even the whole
[41:16] world have sinned and constantly fallen
[41:19] short of the glory of god
[41:21] these seven messengers are making god
[41:23] known to the people
[41:25] he that received them received him that
[41:28] sent them
[41:29] and he quotes in john 13 20. oh glory to
[41:32] god hallelujah praise god oh give the
[41:35] lord some praises

[41:56] whomsoever i send
[41:58] receive at me
[42:00] and he that received me received him
[42:02] that sent me
[42:04] so god send seven messengers

[42:30] in part until when that was a perfect
[42:32] has come

[42:35] perfect has come but when that was
[42:37] proven he has come then that was in
[42:38] patch i'll done away with it
[42:40] so when perfection come god wants
[42:42] perfection
[42:43] come on give the lord a shout

[43:12] they are full of the holy ghost and
[43:14] faith on fire with the fire of god
[43:18] holding forth the word of truth there he
[43:20] stands to back them up and think of it
[43:22] not one believer of any age need to cry
[43:24] in his oh that i might have been back

[43:29] when the apostles were sent out there is
[43:31] no need to look back look up behold him

[43:56] there he stands expressing exactly the
[43:58] life and sustainer and giver of all good
[44:02] gifts to the church
[44:04] so he's not in the midst just to say
[44:05] he's in the midst and he's in the midst
[44:07] no he's a mr heel he's a mr seal he's a
[44:10] mess to deliver he's a mess to break the
[44:12] fat and break the bondage off of your

[54:15] hallelujah
[54:17] so so you find out sunday prophet said
[54:21] preaching the word is not really the
[54:22] gospel because the word is the seed of
[54:25] the gospel because the gospel to be
[54:27] preached is to be preached with signs
[54:29] and wonders on the power of god
[54:31] so when he said uh
[54:33] he he will be received whom my son
[54:35] received at me
[54:37] that is a season to come
[54:39] because i can read it that is a
[54:41] vindicated servant of god
[54:43] not people just practicing and saying
[54:45] and preaching like what are we doing
[54:46] here now that's when god vindicate
[54:48] and identify your son this is my son
[54:50] hear him when god sent a vindicated
[54:53] seven out that's different
[54:55] you see some just went but god has some
[54:57] he will send
[54:58] he'd have sent and went
[55:00] is that who went is who god sent
[55:02] all glory to god and to send him jesus
[55:05] say how are we going to send them he
[55:06] said as my father sent me come on now so
[55:09] send are you
[55:11] and the father who sent him went in him
[55:14] then jesus could unveil god
[55:16] then the sent one in this last days
[55:18] would be able to take the veil off of
[55:20] god
[55:20] oh glory i'm not talking about just
[55:22] letter word i'm talking about pull the
[55:24] veil off of him you know what i'm
[55:26] waiting on i'm waiting he's a little he
[55:29] is here
[55:30] anything can happen and the prophet was
[55:32] able to unveil that god
[55:35] oh god take every spirit under my
[55:37] control for the glory of god doom devils
[55:40] on the run oh give the lord a shout we
[55:42] are going to come back to that
[55:48] hallelujah
[55:50] you can't
[55:51] be a seed and disagree with the word
[55:54] because the word is a seed
[55:56] and if you are the word how can you
[55:58] disagree with it
[55:59] you'll be disagreeing with yourself
[56:02] you'll be defeating your own purpose so
[56:04] the bride will become the word
[56:06] because the spirit of the monk the bride
[56:08] and that fulfills revelation 2 17 the
[56:11] spirit and the bride say come because
[56:13] the word and the bride the bride becomes
[56:15] the word the spirit knows upon the bride
[56:18] [Music]
[56:20] when that season comes the spirit has
[56:21] dried up from all the earth
[56:26] the bride alone will have the spirit
[56:28] she'll be preaching them and there is no
[56:30] more salvation
[56:31] she'll be preaching to eternal lost
[56:33] people
[56:34] all glory to god you know there will be
[56:36] a space
[56:37] a jubilee space for whosoever will
[56:41] and after that space is over
[56:43] it will be judgment
[56:45] not man's ministry but christ ministry
[56:49] to finish isaiah 61 to declare the day
[56:51] of vengeance of our god
[56:54] christ doing that to our bride
[56:55] we can judge who we could who is a judge
[56:58] with our emotions and our feelings it's
[56:59] christ's ministry
[57:01] do you think peter judge announces the
[57:02] fire it's not peter that was the holy
[57:04] ghost he said you're a lighter man you
[57:07] lied to god you liked the holy ghost the
[57:09] holy ghost called him out peter had no
[57:11] charge of that he can say oh god and
[57:13] he's
[57:15] a good speaker
[57:18] no
[57:20] judgement came it was outside peter
[57:22] purview
[57:24] it was outside peter's control
[57:26] it was god in the midst of the people
[57:30] that is what the devil perverted in the
[57:32] beginning take god from the midst and
[57:34] stick it on a man
[57:35] and you end up with a pope
[57:37] and crush the whole church crush the
[57:39] believers they find himself a bunch of
[57:42] people looking to some man
[57:43] and jesus alone walk in the midst of the
[57:45] seventh golden cancer
[57:47] and a man parading his beef
[57:50] and put some knitting jesus christ
[57:53] and god i hate that
[57:56] i hate the lady being conquered
[57:59] i hate the dominating spirit upon the
[58:02] lead i hate that i'm a god of the
[58:04] audience i'm a god of my people
[58:07] i want to come on my people i want to
[58:09] show them i'm god
[58:10] oh glory to god he promised abraham my
[58:13] people child surgeon in a strange land
[58:14] but i might hear that bring them out
[58:16] isn't that right oh glory to god two
[58:18] million people come out and he told
[58:19] those 12 ministers go and bring evidence
[58:22] not more talk
[58:24] bring back evidence
[58:27] show the people something
[58:30] go and bring back the supernatural
[58:32] bring back something that they know
[58:34] they can't explain
[58:36] or give the lord a shock i i don't know
[58:38] what i know what you're thinking about
[58:39] tonight
[58:42] i'm not talking about bringing a
[58:43] co-channel bringing a word of scripture
[58:45] you know bringing evidence that there's
[58:48] a land beyond the river bringing
[58:49] evidence that he is raised from the dead
[58:51] bringing evidence that he is jesus
[58:53] christ the same yesterday to them
[58:55] forever able to heal you able to deliver
[58:57] you able to free you able to seal you
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:05] able to give you a fresh vision
[59:07] [Music]
[59:15] let's continue now that is why jesus
[59:18] was so perfectly manifested
[59:21] god
[59:22] was so perfectly manifested in jesus
[59:25] because he was the word of god amen
[59:29] he was god's word
[59:31] because the word
[59:32] is the conductor of the spirit
[59:36] you can't conduct illnesses you two
[59:38] would
[59:39] you can't put a plug in here and expect
[59:40] current to go through yours you have a
[59:41] certain conductor the wires what you put
[59:44] and run is what you will flow through
[59:47] well god wire is the word
[59:52] the pentecostal didn't have the wire so
[59:54] when the holy ghost fell on them they
[59:56] speak in tongues and everything else but
[59:57] they couldn't conform to the world
[59:59] that's why they gotta live all kind of
[1:00:00] crazy life and still have signs and
[1:00:02] wonders because that was gifts
[1:00:06] so he brought a prophet to bring the
[1:00:07] word that we could receive the word so
[1:00:09] god not promise to use a gift you using
[1:00:11] the word in you
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:17] so when he anointed peter and all of
[1:00:19] them in matthew 10 with temporary power
[1:00:21] to go and preach and cast out devils
[1:00:23] that was just an experience and a
[1:00:25] blessing he gave them because they
[1:00:27] didn't have the real thing yet
[1:00:31] until they went in the upper room
[1:00:33] and god gave them permanent power
[1:00:36] oh glory to god
[1:00:38] with that temporary power peter was
[1:00:40] cussing and denying and all them running
[1:00:43] and the ducking and everything else but
[1:00:45] with permanent power they was crucified
[1:00:47] upside down
[1:00:48] they faced the cross they faced their
[1:00:50] trials they faced their issues because
[1:00:53] they had resident permanent artisan
[1:00:56] willpower
[1:00:57] oh glory to god he said he that
[1:00:59] believeth on me
[1:01:01] as the scripture had said out of his
[1:01:03] belly
[1:01:04] his inner being
[1:01:06] shall flow
[1:01:07] rivers of living water
[1:01:09] that's not coach brother
[1:01:11] that is life
[1:01:13] that's the fountain of life and god
[1:01:14] wants to make you that
[1:01:16] that's the reason he couldn't produce
[1:01:17] nothing but just exactly god and if god
[1:01:20] is in you what more can you be
[1:01:22] oh my
[1:01:23] all of god's son and he said god was
[1:01:26] manifested in them what was it the
[1:01:28] spoken word manifested see now all of
[1:01:30] god's sons must be the same to be born
[1:01:33] of the word and spirit brings us back to
[1:01:36] the spoken word again like john tree to
[1:01:40] be born of the water and spirit what
[1:01:42] does it do it brings you right back here
[1:01:44] we go into the place where you should
[1:01:46] have been at the beginning
[1:01:48] so adam was supposed to reproduce
[1:01:50] another son of god
[1:01:51] another pot of house another power man
[1:01:54] another attribute son of a spirit all
[1:01:57] glory to god but adam fell in the flesh
[1:01:59] and we end up in sex right and that's
[1:02:01] why we were born in sin but he promised
[1:02:03] to bring us right back to that
[1:02:05] but you must be born again of the world
[1:02:07] and the spirit and we couldn't really be
[1:02:09] effectively born until the full world
[1:02:11] came
[1:02:12] and the full spirit came so you send the
[1:02:14] prophet about the fullness of the word
[1:02:15] that you could be truly born correctly
[1:02:18] oh glory to god that word gonna be in
[1:02:21] you you are gonna become that word then
[1:02:24] the spirit will activate the word that's
[1:02:26] in you
[1:02:27] then that's the kingdom in you
[1:02:29] we had brought our life
[1:02:31] oh hallelujah hallelujah all the kingdom
[1:02:35] in you and you have no power
[1:02:40] because the kingdom is power
[1:02:42] the kingdom is life
[1:02:44] jesus was talking about the kingdom i'm
[1:02:45] from the kingdom of god is at hand oh
[1:02:48] behold the kingdom is within you he's
[1:02:50] talking about another world it's another
[1:02:52] land it's another realm all together
[1:02:54] when they say she is dead he said i got
[1:02:56] weaker
[1:02:57] oh glory to god you understand what i'm
[1:02:59] saying in this world they see them dead
[1:03:01] in this other kingdom he's seated on
[1:03:03] sleep he's like one week
[1:03:05] when lazarus was dead he said i'm glad
[1:03:06] for your sake i am not dear
[1:03:08] oh glory i am glad for your sake that we
[1:03:11] are not dear we are there with adam
[1:03:22] he's on time
[1:03:23] he's on time
[1:03:25] he's got to talk lord he's had my dear
[1:03:26] my brother not die and he's got to give
[1:03:28] him some promises he said i am
[1:03:31] the resurrection
[1:03:32] and i am the life
[1:03:34] we talking about the dead man on this
[1:03:35] side but there's no more resurrection on
[1:03:37] this side here now if that just talks
[1:03:39] you can't just talk that talk you have
[1:03:41] to prove that talk i am the resurrection
[1:03:43] in the life he that believeth in me
[1:03:45] though he was dead yet shall he live
[1:03:47] he's still talking he's still talking
[1:03:49] but you have to prove that talk come on
[1:03:50] reach back to me somebody i am the
[1:03:52] resident i talk
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:55] roll away the stone i still talk ok the
[1:03:58] lorna show but when that man said
[1:04:01] lazarus
[1:04:02] come forth that was more than talk
[1:04:04] brother that was spoken with power
[1:04:07] oh hallelujah and lazarus had to come
[1:04:11] all glory to god so you have to go
[1:04:13] beyond the talk

[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:10] hallelujah
[1:08:13] that's the reason of christ's debt
[1:08:15] is to bring us right back
[1:08:17] to sons of god
[1:08:20] now this brings you right back to the
[1:08:21] spoken word where we are god's word made
[1:08:24] manifest you see jesus
[1:08:26] said the same thing he that believeth on
[1:08:28] me who i am i come for and the purpose i
[1:08:31] do to bring a man
[1:08:33] back to believe the word of god and take
[1:08:36] nothing else with it the works that i do
[1:08:38] he will do also
[1:08:39] a man i take the book just as is
[1:08:42] see we notice the spoken word when we
[1:08:44] are gods then we are god's word made
[1:08:47] manifest
[1:08:48] that listen
[1:08:50] that is how god wants his church
[1:08:53] is to manifest himself
[1:08:57] this is god's will
[1:09:00] this is god's desire
[1:09:02] hallelujah now watch how can he manifest
[1:09:06] himself unless his own seed is in that
[1:09:09] person
[1:09:11] how can you use your own thoughts and
[1:09:14] god manifests himself through you how
[1:09:16] can you take your own belief and say
[1:09:17] well my pastor teaches my creed says and
[1:09:19] so on and whatnot he said then jesus the
[1:09:22] death of jesus was nothing to you
[1:09:24] the works that jesus did
[1:09:26] if a man has the seed of god in him
[1:09:30] and the spirit of god
[1:09:33] listen
[1:09:34] watering that seed
[1:09:37] so he's bringing the spirit
[1:09:39] as the water
[1:09:41] to the seed
[1:09:43] so if we only have seed alone that can
[1:09:45] work
[1:09:46] you need to get the water
[1:09:49] to the seed
[1:09:50] and the water is what promised yes
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:56] watch
[1:09:57] watch
[1:09:58] if a man has a seed of gone in him
[1:10:01] with the spirit of god watering that
[1:10:03] seed the same works that jesus was
[1:10:06] manifested in jesus him being the
[1:10:08] original seed of god his death brings
[1:10:11] you back to the original seed of god and
[1:10:14] if that same spirit that was within him
[1:10:17] is in you then the same works will be
[1:10:19] manifested
[1:10:22] so you explain how this gonna be
[1:10:24] he said the reason we have so much uh oh
[1:10:27] he said
[1:10:28] crash
[1:10:29] is because
[1:10:30] uh who is it
[1:10:32] scrap people ministers is because
[1:10:34] they're trying to do
[1:10:35] the works of christ
[1:10:37] without the life of christ
[1:10:40] so
[1:10:41] god connects paul with character because
[1:10:44] the pentecostal failed being gifted and
[1:10:47] to this day they are still gifted some
[1:10:49] of the gifts of the israeli men some
[1:10:50] have gift of healing they still have the
[1:10:52] gifts
[1:10:54] some of the 30 000 church 20 000 to 10
[1:10:56] 000 big churches and they still gifted
[1:10:58] but he's not talking about that they
[1:11:00] still they give some penalty costs of
[1:11:01] god take it from them they still have it
[1:11:03] what he's talking about here is the
[1:11:04] character
[1:11:06] and character is not a gift
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:13] gift of wisdom and all kind of gifts
[1:11:15] give up preaching all that
[1:11:17] but this is not what we're talking about
[1:11:19] this is not a gift
[1:11:21] this is character
[1:11:23] character is not given to you
[1:11:24] is baited through your childs
[1:11:28] and testing
[1:11:30] your place of trying
[1:11:32] is what guarantees you to have character
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:38] whether you say amen or not to steal the
[1:11:40] truth to them
[1:11:45] so people want to live in church that
[1:11:47] they give them character
[1:11:48] they want to put their body on the head
[1:11:50] that not given a character they know all
[1:11:51] the word all the bible all the greek all
[1:11:53] the hebrew that's still not giving a
[1:11:55] character is when they get out of church
[1:11:56] and you'll face your trials and your
[1:11:58] face intestines and you have issues in
[1:12:00] your family and issues in the home
[1:12:02] that is what's going to give you a
[1:12:03] character
[1:12:04] you ain't getting characters sitting
[1:12:05] inside of here you're getting word to go
[1:12:07] out there to face the devil
[1:12:12] and if you can't say amen to this this
[1:12:14] night something wrong with you
[1:12:16] you're a church member
[1:12:19] take that cap and wear it hallelujah if
[1:12:22] you want character you have to
[1:12:24] understand you're getting equipped
[1:12:25] because in boots you get insured you're
[1:12:27] getting equipment tonight you're getting
[1:12:28] badge and everything else to go out and
[1:12:30] fight
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:32] so don't let the devil give you fight
[1:12:33] inside the building you have too much
[1:12:35] problems outside take a fight inside the
[1:12:37] church here
[1:12:38] don't go get fight with me just fight up
[1:12:40] with the world
[1:12:41] take the word and die take the word and
[1:12:44] press take the word
[1:12:46] the word is preached
[1:12:48] and every man every man
[1:12:51] press their way into it
[1:12:53] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:12:56] what a gideon
[1:12:59] let's see if you can wrap up here
[1:13:08] you say if you want a church start with
[1:13:09] the word of god
[1:13:11] you want the life of god start with the
[1:13:13] word of god
[1:13:14] accept the word of god in its fullness
[1:13:15] every measure of it and if that is the
[1:13:17] fullness of god in you then the rain has
[1:13:20] fallen will produce exactly what's in
[1:13:21] your garden
[1:13:23] the real seed of god
[1:13:25] is absorbent for the spirit
[1:13:27] all denominationalism is sticking out
[1:13:29] unbelief take out then the holy spirit
[1:13:31] comes into the dream of life that's
[1:13:33] laying there it produces another seed
[1:13:36] another son of god is born
[1:13:38] i am a branham because i was born of
[1:13:40] charlie and ilabrana
[1:13:41] that makes me a branner because i am
[1:13:43] their seed
[1:13:45] their two agreements their sperm
[1:13:46] together made a seed that made me
[1:13:49] when god and his word becomes one
[1:13:51] when god's spirit waters the seed of god
[1:13:53] the word of god it produces god
[1:13:56] it is not the individual
[1:13:59] it is god
[1:14:00] for you are dead
[1:14:02] you are not yourself no more you reckon
[1:14:04] yourself dead hollowed out waiting for
[1:14:07] the sigil
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:11] i know some of the ministers fighting me
[1:14:12] on this minister jesus christ tell them
[1:14:14] they don't have to mention jesus christ
[1:14:15] nobody i don't have mysteries guys yet
[1:14:18] it's promised
[1:14:19] because the fifo ministry is not men
[1:14:22] the fifo ministry is the ministry of
[1:14:24] jesus christ in the form of a pastor
[1:14:27] form of a prophet form of evangelist
[1:14:29] form of a teacher form of apostle
[1:14:32] in other words it is christ's ministry
[1:14:34] in these men
[1:14:38] it is the full sea germ in them
[1:14:42] because that is what peter had
[1:14:44] and when he was speaking to cornelius
[1:14:46] house when he speak the word he said why
[1:14:48] did he expect these words the holy ghost
[1:14:51] fell upon them that heard the word
[1:14:53] because he had the full germ in him all
[1:14:56] seven virtues was in him
[1:14:59] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:15:02] and he said this thing had to be tested
[1:15:04] and proven to be in the man
[1:15:08] you can't preach it
[1:15:10] i have to live it
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:14] and to prove it you have to test it
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:21] you seen a piece of wood there and you
[1:15:22] think it's solid wood sometimes you put
[1:15:23] your hand hold your hole your whole
[1:15:25] thing goes through you know it's still
[1:15:26] nice it's all inside there
[1:15:29] it's looking nice outside and you put
[1:15:31] your finger
[1:15:34] would like some take out his head
[1:15:35] already
[1:15:37] so to know you have patience or
[1:15:39] temperance
[1:15:41] oh gosh
[1:15:44] how google does that
[1:15:46] hold on go test patient making it quick
[1:15:48] you have to wait
[1:15:50] and when you're waiting you're still
[1:15:51] waiting
[1:15:52] anytime you start you'll find you're
[1:15:53] waiting too long you know something all
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:57] because faith could work with patience
[1:15:59] for the promise to be confirmed
[1:16:01] and patience must have its perfect work
[1:16:04] and it's a perfectionist patience
[1:16:05] waiting on god and waiting for god
[1:16:09] so god is making weight
[1:16:11] and in not waiting this happening and
[1:16:13] that happened and that's happening and
[1:16:15] that temptation and that trials and that
[1:16:17] tension but you're waiting in faith
[1:16:22] what if god told abraham this is that
[1:16:24] coming 25 years from now
[1:16:26] he said thank you hello yeah the imam
[1:16:28] booze for 24 years
[1:16:30] and come back shaky head and she called
[1:16:31] the drink and
[1:16:33] instead of smoking he put some mints
[1:16:34] inside his mouth
[1:16:36] i'm smoking a back in church
[1:16:38] because you know this year is the year
[1:16:39] this is the year of jubilee this is 25
[1:16:41] years i'm seeing
[1:16:43] god couldn't do it
[1:16:45] he dropped her promise at him and let
[1:16:47] him wait
[1:16:49] how long
[1:16:50] 25 years he dropped a promising disciple
[1:16:53] and said wait until the promise of the
[1:16:54] father
[1:16:55] how long
[1:16:57] 14 days he said until
[1:16:59] he didn't tell him when he's coming in
[1:17:00] about josh but the bible said when the
[1:17:02] day of pentecost was fully come
[1:17:04] so there's a day for you
[1:17:06] it's coming
[1:17:09] it's god in the man it's the sea germ
[1:17:12] like the beginning the spoken word is
[1:17:13] god's word made manifest then it isn't
[1:17:15] the man it's the man that died
[1:17:18] he can't be a hybrid in her son at the
[1:17:20] same time he's either a son of death or
[1:17:22] son of life
[1:17:24] so if he's a son of that get over to the
[1:17:26] devil and kill it give it over to god i
[1:17:28] meant that let him kill the devil that's
[1:17:29] in you run him out hollows you let god
[1:17:32] plant his own life in you then it's not
[1:17:34] you no more
[1:17:35] it is god
[1:17:37] oh my so the holy spirit comes in the
[1:17:39] form of a dove he come not you i breathe
[1:17:42] in but you are virgin born and then
[1:17:44] through this i'm giving this life that
[1:17:47] if you by faith will accept
[1:17:50] will accept the father all the prophets
[1:17:52] all the word i will pour my life down
[1:17:54] upon you and you can't do nothing else
[1:17:56] but produce the same life the same thing
[1:17:58] that i do
[1:17:59] what was he
[1:18:00] made he made himself a man god has made
[1:18:03] flesh and dwelt among us the world has
[1:18:04] made flesh dwelt among us god's spoken
[1:18:06] word true aversion brought forth a body
[1:18:09] and in that body come water and spirit
[1:18:11] the wash by the water of the word and
[1:18:13] then
[1:18:14] he went in him and dwelt in him and
[1:18:15] there comes the life of god manifesting
[1:18:18] himself through christ he was the
[1:18:19] anointed one and then we see he was
[1:18:21] god's would be manifest now he died here
[1:18:23] we go in order to pay the debt of your
[1:18:26] hybridian
[1:18:28] that's why he died
[1:18:30] because we're a hybrid so you have to
[1:18:31] pay the debt to correct that all right
[1:18:33] so what's something now my what is it
[1:18:36] that you could die to yourself until you
[1:18:37] are no more yourself but be filled with
[1:18:39] this word believe in his word and then
[1:18:41] the holy spirit was in him comes down to
[1:18:44] water that word to make it grow and when
[1:18:47] and then what is it god manifesting
[1:18:50] continuing the work of his full son his
[1:18:53] only begotten that died for our hybrid
[1:18:55] in life that he might reconcile us back
[1:18:57] to be sons and daughters of god and
[1:18:59] through the church my flow here we go
[1:19:01] the same life by the word
[1:19:03] continuing the work being manifested as
[1:19:07] it was in christ
[1:19:09] christ was god word made manifest and he
[1:19:12] died and gave his life that he might
[1:19:14] send the spirit and take his body up and
[1:19:16] send the spirit back to water and pay
[1:19:19] the redeeming price if we believe it and
[1:19:21] it's right then come the holy spirit
[1:19:23] upon the same word oh glory to god then
[1:19:26] the bible has got to be in you prophecy
[1:19:29] the bible has got to be in you so you
[1:19:31] can't take the book and stick it in
[1:19:32] through that go for surgery and put it
[1:19:34] back inside you that's the only bible
[1:19:36] inside of you is the word that'll go
[1:19:37] inside of you so this pyramid is the
[1:19:39] bible
[1:19:40] so when this word go in you you have the
[1:19:41] bible in you you have the pyramid in you
[1:19:43] it's not right
[1:19:45] then the word is a seed as long as it's
[1:19:47] lean here it won't do no good but when
[1:19:49] it comes in here it comes in the heart
[1:19:51] then it begins to manifest by the holy
[1:19:53] spirit
[1:19:54] the works of god
[1:19:56] are you ready
[1:19:57] then visions come
[1:20:00] power comes
[1:20:01] humility come all you know it all is
[1:20:04] gone
[1:20:04] you become nothing christ become alive
[1:20:07] you die he lives there it is because he
[1:20:10] die i live when i die he lives again o
[1:20:13] praise the name of the lord do you
[1:20:14] believe that
[1:20:16] believe us the word and spirit are
[1:20:18] absolutely one you don't use your own
[1:20:20] thinking you don't use your own mind he
[1:20:23] said the mind that was in christ is in
[1:20:24] you you are god's living word
[1:20:28] representative of him here on earth
[1:20:30] continuing the work
[1:20:32] oh my the church should be that way
[1:20:35] so the bible is manifested again like in
[1:20:38] the early days of the disciples just
[1:20:39] like disciples the bible is living again
[1:20:41] in you
[1:20:42] so the bible is manifested again like
[1:20:44] the earliest of christ because you are a
[1:20:46] predestinated seed just like christ was
[1:20:49] just like christ was you are a
[1:20:52] predestinated seed do you believe that
[1:20:55] are you ready for this big bomb here now
[1:20:57] and when the rain falls on the seed the
[1:21:00] life produces itself when the holy
[1:21:03] spirit falls
[1:21:05] oh glory to god hallelujah you shall
[1:21:08] receive power when
[1:21:10] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:21:12] that holy ghost is not pentecostal holy
[1:21:14] ghost it's not looter holy ghost it's
[1:21:16] not where the holy ghost is the holy
[1:21:17] ghost itself seven spirits

[1:21:26] rain
[1:21:27] there was a vision of the seed crying of
[1:21:29] center screen send us rain and then the
[1:21:30] rain began to fall tears pop up
[1:21:32] everybody everybody rained los angeles
[1:21:34] waiting to sink because rain had to hit
[1:21:36] that seed and manifest that sinking
[1:21:39] everything had to hit the rain you know
[1:21:40] the rain you know he said the devil
[1:21:42] waiting on what the rain the fall has
[1:21:43] dynamics the united nations to enforce
[1:21:45] laws to close only churches

[1:21:50] dynamics are waiting for you know and
[1:21:51] the law already in us you know after 50
[1:21:53] something years we just written the
[1:21:55] dynamics

[1:22:21] the experience he said and when it fell

[1:22:26] before the foundation of the world they
[1:22:28] were predestined to see that's right
