thank you so much musicians thank you brother Steven for the wonderful song service this morning are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning wonderful before you take your seats this morning can we turn to two portions of scripture reading from The Book of Romans 8 and St John 142 familiar scriptures this morning as we Endeavor to encourage the Believers in such a time as this amen reading Romans 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and reading St John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall ye do also and Greater Works and these shall you do because I go unto my father may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Al I de gree to church in the precious name of Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege to be in the land of the living and to be able to come to the house of the Lord to give God his due he is worthy he is deserving of our worship and our praise he is God by the fact that he is worthy of worship and he is God all by himself his worship is not dependent on how we feel his worship is not dependent on what we have or don't have he deserves the worship because he is God and if he is your God then you will serve him if he is your god you will praise him if he is your god you will worship Him can the church say amen amen there's something powerful just about worship even with a lack of understanding you could still worship even when you have problems you could still worship can the church say Amen so I have a title this morning breaking past your barriers breaking past your barriers we all have barriers that we need to overcome in fact the world itself would have had different types of barriers to break through there was a time when only the horse was the means of transport after man figured out that you know walking was just too exhausting and then somebody I don't know who was the first person who decided why don't I jump on this thing that's walking around here and maybe he could carry me further than my legs could carry me and you know whoever was the first one somebody else saw it and before you know it people were on horse back but that only lasted so long and then horse became the horse and buggy so this one horse could have pulled more than one person because somebody got wheels and and as man progressed barriers were being broken and and the horse and the horse and buggy became the car and for some reason the Benchmark against which the car was measured was horsepower because the horse was the frame of reference or the example that had guided things for so long so then you measure car by how much horsepower the car has so the car has two horsepower three horsepower until you have 300 horsepower so you in a car that is worth 300 horses does that make sense so so in so doing man begin to break from one barrier to another barrier and brother Brandon preaching this from the horse and buggy to the car and then from the car to the Aeroplane so no longer you are you are trying to cover the ground physically anymore but now you are you are moving above the ground and and then man reached the astronaut age breaking another barrier to move from horse to car to plane to the to the astronaut or the the rocket shape age or whatever you want to call it until you break out of this this this this system that we in this environment this this realm that we are in everybody with me this this morning over the last few days I don't know how many of you saw the news but Tesla who has been a groundbreaking company and and Elon Musk and bovid has had different sessions on AI and technology and where it's going but this week he launched or released or announced three Technologies one of which we sort of expected which was now the car was launched without the the steering wheel and you could summon the car and all of the economic privileges and benefits of it and an analyst said that when you look at this barrier that is being broken very soon they're going to say it is not worth for man to drive any vehicle because man will be a danger to himself and all these you know computerized cars will talk to one another so an accident becomes impossible because you can't talk to the driver two cars ahead or five cars ahead or 10 cars ahead of you but these computerized AI driven powered cars will be able to talk to a car 100 cars away 200 Cars away and nowhere to take you to avoid traffic and all of these things he also launched a a a robo van and then he he launched a robot that could walk and it could clean and it could serve food and it could mix things and it could clean the house and and it could see people who say well finally I don't have to clean the house anymore because now there's a there's a robot that could do that but what it does show is that man will not stop at trying to break past some kind of barrier and this is not a new thing because when you go back to Genesis man also worked on breaking a barrier on Nimrod and they built a tower that was was was effectively so well constructed that God himself had to interrupt the program and God said if I don't go down and deal with this progress this barrier has been broken they will reach into heaven so it took a Divine Interruption into nimr's laboratory to stop the progress that nimron was making I want you to appreciate that God looked at the UN Unity of the people the the the the everyone was in one mind and they were in one Accord and they had one purpose to be able to connect Heaven to Earth and God said if I don't interrupt man is so powerful that he could achieve it on his own you heard what I said and God had to come now to confound his language and now we are reaching full circle back to when you look at the day of Pentecost and Peter was able to speak we know it's in scripture and every man heard in his own language so we saw the Holy Spirit as the mechanism to almost reverse or or or deal with what God did there by the Tower of Babel right so the Holy Ghost was able to when Peter preached there was no translator on the pulpit because the Holy Ghost was able to speak to each person but now man is saying that with AI and AI glasses and these things you could go to a foreign country and the glasses will speak to your ear and translate what a person saying even if you don't know what they're saying man is once again trying to reach back where they were that God dealt with years ago so I have a question for you this morning because my Bible tells me I am the Lord and I change not but the brandom said if God don't deal with Sodom Andor Mor now and deal with Los Angeles now and deal with the work now he would have to go back and repent for what he did to sangor years ago but because he's the same God he has to take the same action now that he did back then because he would not be God so if God had to come down back then to interrupt the progress of Man based on what man's achievement was then you want to tell me God will not do the same thing now to break up all of the advancement if it puts us into a position where but the brandom said man break into God's laboratory can the church say amen and the Bron made a statement years ago he said the world is making progress he said the world went from Cars to to from horse and buggy to cars and from Cars to planes and from Planes to Rockies and he said the church is moving too slow because man is making progress he said what man is doing should be a parallel or a side show to what is happening in a spiritual realm in other words if you are in a spiritual horse and buggy this morning you need to move very quickly from that spiritual horse and buggy into a spiritual car to a spiritual plane and then when the Brandon preacher about being a spiritual astronaut because we are not supposed to be living here on this Earth we are supposed to be getting out of here and you can't leave here on a horse and buggy you can't leave here in a car you can't leave you in a plane you have to be in a rocket a Rapture Express rocket that's going to take you from this realm to another place that's going to take you from mortality to immortality that will take you from sickness to Good Health that will take you from going older to take you to getting younger man will never perfect that technology man will never build that technology can the church say Amen that spiritual technology oh you don't hear me this morning Hall I'm just talking to you this morning so there's technology that God has perfected a long time ago when Philip needed to get to a Revival he just had to be translated from where he was to another place man I figure that one out yet oh you don't hear me this morning Peter and they were in a prison and they were praying there and when they were praying the chains were being broken where they were at man hasn't figured out that technology yet and they could never figure out that technology because that's God Divine intelligence come on now oh hallelujah hallelujah when brother brand could say before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down and in the doctor's room the tumor begin to move and the doctor have to wonder what just happened Hallelujah nobody could build that technology that's God's technology that's spiritual techn techology can the church say Amen when Elijah was caught up in a chariot of fire that was in an El that was Tesla car make that oh come on now somebody help me this morning Tesla cannot make that Hallelujah you don't hear me this morning when that widow woman was about to cook her last meal and she said this is my last meal and my last oil and Elijah said bake me a cake first and when she did that every day she went to the same flow to the same oil and for three and a half years without having to go to massive stores or go to or you don't hear me this morning without having to go to the grocery the flower never went down Tesla cannot make that you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah brother Bram T he say right now you lay hands on the sick but when that time comes you will command the Devils to leave no man-made technology could do that but there's a barrier we have to break Hallelujah to enter into that realm there's a barrier you have to break to go to your next level you have to do something more than you did before you have to have more tolerance you have to have more strength oh can the church say amen hallelujah more power brother Terence that's right Hallelujah takes more power no horse and buggy could take off off the ground you need more than one horse to get fast enough to break off a Runway you could put 15 horses and string them together they will never take off but when you get a plane engine and you see that plane engine begin to M and they begin to run down the runway you have to reach a certain speed to get enough lift oh you don't hear me I'm not an engineer but there's a spiritual anointing here this morning but the brand I'm call a spiritual scientist you have to have enough speed to pick up enough lift so that airplane can come up the ground you need a bigger engine this morning oh come on somebody preach back to me you need a bigger engine this morning a holy ghost powered engine to move you faster than you've ever moved before [Music] amen hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh Hallelujah I wonder what kind of engine Phillip had brother brother puncher to move where he was to go down into that Revival oh he had a different kind of engine it wasn't a regular a regular car engine it wasn't a plane engine it was a Holy Ghost Engine when that man came to Jesus and said listen listen my servant is sick he said you don't even need to come just speak the word and I know my servant will be healed I'm a man under Authority when I say to one go he goes and if you just say the word I know my S will be healed that man had such a revelation that by the time he was close to home he didn't ask them if he was healed he asked them what time what time he was healed because the word of God is sharper it's faster it's more powerful than any twoed sword and the church say [Applause] Amen we talking about breaking past barriers and we going to get to Breaking past your barrier so we speaking in general first and we're going to come to your personal barriers every four years or so there's are Olympics and in this Olympics they talk about the world record and it's amazing because years ago there were different records now look at me I'm no expert they are far more better experts here than these things I don't already follow these things but I shared with my daughter had a very bad experience with sports in school and that affected me so I've never been for those of you who know me I've never been a sports person Gideon and Andrew they were far more gifted than I was in that particular Ministry I told my daughter he was in form two I was the team chaplain they would only call me to pray but on that faithful day they were out of players and being short and of players and desperate for one last man you know in school when you pick you you you know first pick second pick well I was a the never pick but on this faithful day it was like they had no choice it was an interclass match and I was the Last Man Standing it was not I was not picked it just happened to be as the only man left so it was you had to play and my daughter when you tell her something she do doesn't forget it so she has asked me a few times about it but I remember all I remember is playing and every time I try to hit the ball to kick I fell down and you know how school children could be those things could haunt you for a while so I've never been W into sports but it is intriguing because someone who's been into sports and Usain Bolt comes to mind because before Usain Bolt ran there was records that were set before him and when he ran he broke and there was a new record set and it's called a new world record so you know how boring the Olympics will be if Nobody Breaks a record because the Olympics is more than what country wins is rarely to test and challenge what we believe to be possible before can the church say Amen so when somebody comes and they break a record it's like wo and this man is so fast or whatever that is and it's an encouragement because and it's amazing because over time records keep getting broken but there's such a thing as and and when you reach to speak to a real professional they start to talk about not necessarily running against the others but they talk about their own personal best so you'll see guys like Usain Bolt and these great athletes you know them better than I do they really at they reach a point where they don't even care what other people do when they want to beat their own personal record and it's a big thing when you break your own personal record and when you realize in life that you are racing not against anybody else but yourself your perspective changes let me say that one more time your race in life is not against anybody else because if you could keep beating your own personal best you could become Unstoppable you know half of the challenge we have is when you are looking at somebody else what this one doing what that one doing and you get so caught up because the amount of time you spend looking at what other people doing you could be focused on your own personal best I want to make a new record with my personal best when it comes to my prayer life can I break my personal record when it comes to forgiveness can I break my personal record when it comes to not gossiping yeah you ever hear somebody who who say like a recovering alcoholic I've been sober for 12 days I've been sober 30 days you would say I haven't gossiped in 20 days I haven't gossiped in I see some people here like I never thought of it like that boy it's been 180 days since I gossiped I was saying with my wife you could only get a breakthrough when we could first see your problem you know so that's why when you go to Alcoholics Anonymous you they say my name is Isaac and I'm an alcoholic if you can't even start there you can't get any help so my name is Isaac and I'm a gossiper it has been one day since my last gossip and you are now working in your life to keep breaking records oh come on somebody help me preach this morning whatever you're trying to overcome you have to first acknowledge it I'm a sinner I'm in trouble now it's been one day since I dropped that thing oh you don't hear me this morning we talking about breaking past your barriers because we all have barriers there are things that are holding us back because if you're trying to this is why I hope this helps you this morning whenever you Bard a plane there's a reason the a portion how much bags you could carry it is a federal offense to the airline to fly a overweight plane because if a plane is overweight the plane could crash so it's not just two bags and five bags they can tell you listen breads even if you're pay we can't carry that we to know because there's too much weight on the plane we don't want to meet a level of turbulence and we all going down and you and your bags going down so there's such a thing as being so heavy you can't break your barrier I want you to get this because you're carrying so much weight that you can't go where it's supposed to go because you're weigh down with lust you're weigh down with animosity you we Down With Envy you we down with your past you weigh down with guilt you we down with shame and embarrassment you there carrying the whole way to what people think about you you there stressed out about 22 years ago you stressed out about who will shake your hand you stressed about what SE your on you stressed out because nobody here call you and you just your whole plane you trying to move on you Runway and you your plane are going anywhere but if you get light this morning if you get light this morning then you can take off can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah some of us too heavy this morning and we got to let things go let things go because that's a barrier because but the B describe it and I'm going to get to the court he said when it reach the barrier the plane begins to shake your can't afford to be heavy when the plane you have some pressure to break past the sound barrier you got to be sure that your plane could weather the storm of breaking past the oh come on now somebody help me this morning so I want to encourage you this morning if you have Arts today drop it throw it overboard let's open your plane this morning and let's have to pull some bags [Applause] out I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible cuz some people will miss it because they have too much stuff you may be seated and don't try no don't try no tricks in her brother Clark I know brother Clark used to work in the airport they have a weight restriction on you and a bag and I've seen people say listen that bag cannot go you have to take some stuff out and you have to decide if you go in or you staying because if you want to board a plane you have to take some stuff out the bag and when people open up their bag it's sometime it could be a little embarrassing thing you know because you there in the public you're holding up the line you they take out and when they watch it a set that shouldn't be flying and now the embarrassment they should have dealt with at home and ready check what this supp carry now in public all of you they watching you but where you going with that is royal castle is KFC is green seasoning is you go in Miami you're going to New York and you carrying coconut and and and and he play say we not carrying some of these things health hazard all kind of thing you're carrying ins anything and know decide do I carry three coconut 20 coconut two coconut and you did because you cannot carry everything and you understand to go to this Raptor you cannot carry everything all the thing you want to carry you can't carry the thing you work to fight for you can't carry where we going what you make sure you have there it has to be perfect love because only perfect oh God help me this morning only perfect love is what it can take over there that's why Paul said aside everything that so easily beset me I want to lay it aside so I could walk nothing must hold me back I want to approach the altar with nothing to stop me when the Lord see me coming he must say nothing against you nothing against you nothing against you nothing against [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you my husband do this my wife do this the children do this so you had to take 20 2 minutes in the service to just get to reboot your system to hear the word if he didn't talk to me so is had to be different you know but oh gosh and you realize that you can't control nobody else but you listen all of us struggleing with it or know this is not a huge struggle and I'm not struggling I have to reframe and reboot but wait a minute I can't control nobody I could help them I could talk to them but it's still their choice on how they behave but they have to learn to control your reaction you can't pray you can't get any spirit because somebody tell you something and a lot of the issues are in the home you know oh God should I drive down the road or hit braks because I can hit the braks some saying Drive some want to answer because the issues in because the people who closest to you have the most impact on you you know somebody BS you on on high low Massy something and and you could shake it off easier but somebody eat your a little yogurt in the fridge home and the neighbor had to know it was your yogurt and it was your flavor and it's two days you waiting to eat it and you had plans to eat it on Saturday morning and what really wrong with them and these are message believers we not talking no I'm not dealing with outside I dealing with here and the behavior that so easily beset as that if the Holy Spirit would want to walk in the house you say not now now you know that you ever meet somebody having a conversation and they say not now let me make a spin and come back because whatever going on the ID don't want again when that calm down I will come back and the Holy Spirit want to walk in the house any time don't give him a reason to say h let me come back tomorrow yes because as a child you're disrespecting your mother as a child you're disrespecting your father as a wife you're not referencing your husband as a husband you're not loving your wife we have to bring it back to the home because Ephesians is about the family being prepared to leave this place can the church say Amen you have to forgive me if I trying to keep it simple this morning but I see people a lot with a lot of word and they have no Behavior husband and wife can't behave children and parents can't behave you have no Rapture to go because Ephesians teach about the family unit being in order to leave this place somebody help me preach this [Applause] morning we have to get the family unit right not about oppression with an understanding of where we all fit because God is a god of order wives have a place husbands have a place fathers have a place children have a place and don't worry children you're going to grow up and the Lord carries you will have the same challenges and the same responsibilities and when you get older you'll reckon but wait a minute my parents were not as daed use a good word as I thought they were because now you have reached a certain level of maturity to understand certain things when I was a child I speak at a child the Bible said I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things barriers are holding us back can the church say amen everybody feeling fine this morning I really want to salute brother Gideon for the service on Wednesday night God bless you brother [Applause] Gideon Wednesday was a promotion for him but Anthony wasn't well but Stephen couldn't make it and real Soul Thing You C be faint tell him the only thing he didn't do is play you know ask him ask him he was going to play and sing he say but he stood here and sng and preach and close out and so God bless you may God give you a strength and I only found out afterwards he wasn't even feeling well but he came to his poster Duty and many times because of the role we play in life we have to do things against our feelings we have to be a father when we need to be a father we have to be a mother we can't we can't say you know what I taking a time out coming back next week when I put back on the father hat on the mother hat don't let me TR when the father and the mother get sick because somehow when fathers get sick they can't move I come into the home and tell all come in here this morning when he father gets sick he can't move he can't move he can't move when he mother sick she said do everything anybody know what anybody here know what I'm talking about I see the wife's careful to answer you some real wisdom getting put here this morning morning I just say I've heard this complaint it's been complaint but so let let wisdom Prevail but the reality is this that's to nearly Point home our responsibilities in life sometimes requires to go beyond our feelings beyond the challenges we face because if we don't deal with it the problems don't disappear let me say that one more time sometimes we feel by ignoring the problem when we finish the problem will go away but there are some problems that even if you ignore them when you come out of your ignorance State you still have to confront the reality that the problem is still there and we have to get stronger to deal with the problems that exist breaking past your barriers familiar quote brother Bram going beyond the camp you know I was told some time ago that they had a plane now that can make them noises we hear around here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do I think in there that we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp can the church say Amen so there there's this thing about this sound barrier your own limit of how much you pray how much you worship how much you sacrifice how much you give to you could break past your own limitation and reach into a realm that brother Adam said it's unlimited what God can do with a man do you understand that that a point that brother said that that you could live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with you I want that kind of life that the devil had to say you know what I fed up deiving brother Andy I go and find somewhere because everything I throw at him somebody we still in church somebody we still standing I do this I do this I do this I do this and nothing shaken him it don't make sense anymore because I've reached a point there is nothing could move him anymore the prophet say you can live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with you he tried this that fail he tried this that fail he tried that that fail and say I don't have anything else to know because the word tells us we are not ignorant of Satan's devices it means his devices are limited so we know what he coming with can the church say Amen but you can live such a life God help us to live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with you he he throw pain in your body but you still worship you know if you make your default response situations worship you know the devil will get just get confused let me say that one more time brother George make your default response worship let your automatically when they reset you the factory settings your de for response is worship you get a piece of bad news you worship you get good news you worship you're feeling sick you worship you want something you worship somebody do you some you worship yeah whatever it is but a Clarance you just worship and watch your whole approach to life change oh can the church say Amen dealing with the barriers the barriers let me read one example here we know it in Matthew 15 we preach this many time Matthew 15: 211 then Jesus went then and departed onto the coast of Ty and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil so here we have a woman who has already broken past a major barrier because she's a Canaanite you know how hard it is for a Canaanite to even approach a Jew because Canaanites were sworn enemies of the Jews so she had to first break past her barrier that I'm a Canaanite and this is a Jude that I'm going to approach can the church say Amen so her situation became so desperate she didn't care no more what she had to overcome to get what she wanted and when you reach a point of desperation to don't care what nobody think or feel or see because you want to get something it'll change your whole approach so this woman come out and see Jesus and already she is saying things that don't make sense of her belief this is an enemy of the Jews saying oh Lord so she's acknowledg him as Lord yeah Jesus is no Lord to a Canaanite but this woman had to overcome what she believed oh you don't hear me this morning th son of David so she's recognizing what Jews of the day they even recognize with the chorge can the church say Amen my daughter is grievously vexed with it ever but he answered her not a word so it went from the barrier of who she was and the barrier of her belief system and the barrier that she's a Canaanite and the barrier that he's a Jew and the barrier that she had her own Gods and the barrier that she's acknowledged him as Lord and Son of David to the barrier of Silence could you handle the barrier of Silence could you handle the barrier of praying and God refuses to answer you because the time is not yet here it is this woman has already made an acknowledgement that others have refused to acknowledge I want you to understand the context of the situation they are Jews they are Pharisees they are Sadducees that don't even know who Jesus is and here's a woman who's a gentile saying Lord son of David she overcame religious beliefs and doctrines and all of these things and after that God even hit her BL and say you catch something other a catch he give us silent treatment anybody with me this morning how many of us and I want to bring it home how many of us say but you no longer praying for something and God are answering anybody ever found themselves saying how long I pray I he I would but this woman overcame that barrier also he answered her not a word so he answered and she switched strategies the Bible said and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us so when she realized that Jesus wasn't taking her on she start to go and touch Peter hey Peter Peter Peter Peter James James Peter Peter James John James John Peter James John Peter because Jesus not answering anything I want you to appreciate how persistent she became we know who this lady is you know but she's dealing with her situation and her situation is bigger than whatever she has to do she has overcome her belief to acknowledge who God is she has overcome her situation and say well if Jesus not hearing me let me go to the Elder let me go to the Deacon let me ask one of the ministers but I'm not leaving church today without what I come for I'm not leaving his service yester morning the same way that I came the situation when my daughter is too much and not going home not today I come too far to go back home this way James Peter John but Hugh but Joe I don't care who I to talk to I need to get somebody to let Jesus know I'm not going home today without getting a touch can the church say amen I come to Worship in a second right and his disciples came and besought him besought him means to beg him you know so they come and say Jesus do something now please because overbearing to us we can help her and we can handle this lady coming over and over saying that she need to get something send her away for she cried after us but he answered and said to them I am not sent but unto the Lost House of the sheep of Israel so he's saying I have come for anybody who is not a Jew so she could keep crying but IED him to help her then she changed strategy again she went from trying to get Jesus to to the disciples so they he say well here I come for you and she changed and look at the Bible says she came and worshiped him so her first approach brother George was one of making a request now she changed strategy to worship Hallelujah anybody seeing the keys being unlocked right here this morning many time we go to prayer and our prayer is Lord give me and Lord I need and Lord I want and Lord I desperate and Lord I need and Lord I want and l i desperate and here she said well if that didn't approach didn't work and I called you that he didn't answer and I went to the El Deon and answer let me te stry she just had to worship Lord you are good you are worthy Lord you are Mighty you are powerful and and Jesus start to look he said this is different now because she going Beyond just oh come on and somebody help [Applause] me only when she worshiped Jesus gave his first response oh I want you I want you to get a key this morning so if you came to the house of God and then worship you have no response again soon she he worship now the situation changed then he answered it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs so worship put her unspeaking condition oh God you help me this morning the moment she began to worship she could now reach a point to have a conversation you want a conversation with god this morning start to worship him you want to hear from God this morning worship Him worship after nothing to do with you it has to do with who he is oh Lord you are worthy You Are Holy you are Mighty you are powerful you are oh break past your barrier of worship this morning lift up your hands and
