is it a people tonight [Music] may God bless you and thanks for coming and we want to go straight into the wood Matthew chapter 16 I want to read from 13 to 18. Hebrews 11 from 1 to 6 on second Timothy 3 1 verse here for 16. reading Matthew chapter 16 and verse 13. when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi acts the disciples saying whom do men see are the son of man am and they said some Sita what John the Baptist samillas others Jeremiah is one of the prophets he says unto them but whom say he that I am and Simon Peter answered and said unto Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are those Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it on disease but my Father which is in heaven Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it Hebrews 11 verse 1. now Faith is a substance of King's book for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report true faith we understand that the worlds were freeing by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things but to appear by fit Ebel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Keen by which he obtained witness that he was a righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speak it by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not formed because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God and without faith it is impossible to please him for he did come into God must believe that he is that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him our last scripture from second Timothy 3 and we want to read from verse 16. there's one verse there all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instructions in righteousness may God bless his word you may be seated praise God it's good to be here tonight what a blessing and a privilege to be here and the house of God tonight and um this scripture we touched on it many times in the Amplified every scripture is God breathes or given by his inspiration note the scripture itself is given by his inspiration and profitable for dark instruction for reproof and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness in holy living in Conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action we have a message in that will be played back a couple of services a couple of weeks ago okay so tonight I have a title until this thing is inspired to you as a title I know it's not complete but the rest of it is you are in the same shape until this thing is inspired to you you are in the same shape okay let's go it's good to hear the hallelujahs tonight amen Hallelujah is very encouraging I mean praise the Lord somebody giving God praise amen all right so let's get down get on to work not long ago he said I heard a case where a woman that belonged to a certain Church she might a boy dear the boy was converted but the woman wasn't they move away from the neighborhood she was a Pianist in the church she moved under the neighborhood the ladies in the neighborhood wasn't as moral and clean as they were at the other neighborhood so they wore Beauty shorts and anybody that's born again known as wrong it's only the devil to make you to strip your clothes there was never nobody in the Bible just demon powers that does these things and the word is full of it and then this woman know she said wait a minute my mama was just so old-fashioned foggy Christian and if these other women can be just as good standing in the church as I am why can't I do as they do that was in a mind to begin with she said I could be just as good as thee and did just as much thought of see that's that's reasoning now her soul will tell her that is wrong but she push it aside are we getting somewhere tonight she went to doing it anyhow the layers of the church most of them smoke cigarettes which is one of the coolest and the worst thing that woman ever done in this Modern Age if the ladies can smoke why can't I smoke so she started doing that her husband tried to tell her honey we don't do that she said no look John she do it anyway now this Soul the Bible said the soul that sinner shall die the word dead means to separate in other words the soul that disbelieves the word of God shall finally separate from you I watch your watch how these words are carefully placed now debt if I die now or any Christian would die it wouldn't be a separation from God because either heard my words and believe in him that sent me has everlasting life but you would separate from one from another she kept grieving that soul finally it begin to separate from her and go away and after a while she got to a place that a young fellow move in a neighborhood a married man she began to have a lot of Friendship with this nice slick looking fellow he picking her up taking up places finally it wonged up and kissing her good night at The Back Fence and after a while she left her husband he left his wife and they married which is contrary to the word of God but that soul disbelieving it it finally just moved away from God got away from it she was going by reasoning she was still playing the piano in the church she was still a good member just as good as anybody she moved into another neighborhood but this man continued on into the church brought her letter to another church and then the first thing you know this woman finally and if that man and any woman or either one ought to know if a companion will be untrue to a companion he'll be untrue or she will to you so he took up with another woman and she takes off again runs around finally wound up with a common law husband and it finally caught up with her she began to get some aches and pains in the lower regions and then she went to the doctor it was Advanced magnesi doctor said for his coming a city Minister which is a friend of mine went to her to talk about her soul to her she gave him to understand smoking one cigarette after the other I never sent for you I am just as good as you are no that's the very attitude prove what she was she said I belong to the church I was raised in the church he said listen did I belong to the same generation you do I know that our church doesn't teach that you've got to be born again man telling her that what about that man she said you get the door if I have wanted you I would have sent for you she said all right I've done what I can then in talking with the minister I said watch her no no he was trying to get her prepared so I could go and pray for her and I believe the woman would have been healed I said watch her at the end of the road that's the only way cause she just committed that sin and went to reasonings instead of listening to her school and that soul will catch up with her someday now when she come time to die her pastor with her the people in the room and everything just as normal thought she was all right everything believed she was all right and when she come time to die here we go I want to get this spot the mental faculties is operated by Blood and nerves which is in the brain and that will perish at your debt your mental faculties and your reasoning will pass away cause reasonings could not come in the presence of God it reasons with God it is the soul that lives so in other words uh remember sometimes I'm preaching I'm talking about all the CXC and the GC any doctor degree all that is in that intellectual level there which is a conscious level when you're dying that conscious breaks up because the mind is where the nerves and the blood that breaks up and your soul that's this unconscious level comes up and that is what is presented to God all right so watch notice the blood cease to go through her brain cells and the nerves season her memories her reasonings begin to Cast Away then what happened that soul that has been grieved away that had been dead to her all these years begin to come up to her and she screamed my God I'm lost and the Pastor said yeah there dairy she said I'm lost and the doctor ran and said she's getting hysterically and they give her a hyper World injection and she says scream out and they gave her another one till finally dying with this on the lips I am lost I am lost and the injections of The Testament it sealed her lips to Mortal ears but that soul that realized that had been grieved away it will haunt her as long as there's eternity so remember here we go tonight don't go by reasoning you be sure you're right there's a way of doing that that's accepting Jesus Christ and being born again of the spirit of God where entire soul testifies the word of God is right and stay with it and believe every word cause your spirit Bears record of his Spirit then if you love the world and it's either the world the love of God is not even in you since the Bible and now that is not talking about Lutheran or Plymouth Brethren I'm speaking about Holiness people Pentecostals and the rest that's right so but I'm saying I'm not talking about them people I don't want all of you all praise the name of the Lord do you get it tonight so it doesn't make no sense holding on to the senses and the reasoning and your own thoughts and your memory throw it out start to just believe what God Said to just believe what God Said say God you said it I believe it my soul is resting on it I'm convinced this is truth this is the word oh praise the name of the Lord are you with me now all right let's go brother Brown now to the True Believer it's the revelation of God being revealed in the age we are living in he said my words are spirit and life and Jesus said again the word is a seed that I saw a sword now we know that's true it is God in word form and can only be interpreted by himself are you ready the human mind is not capable to interpret the mind of God or get the love some praises the human mind is not capable to interpret the mind of God how a little finite mind interpret the infinite mind when we can't even interpret one another mind okay the Lord some Praises so all the intellect cannot interpret what God Said from the throne from his mouth them seven perfect spirits that went forth out of the Throne of God or to the mouth of God human mind can interpret that we'll give the Lord some Praises he is the only one that can interpret it and he interpreted to whomsoever he will oh praise God praise God praise God oh glory to God who do men say either some say you are deaf some say you are dark some say in your other but they're not inspiration drop down praise God upon Peter and Peter said toward the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus and Flesh and Blood have not revealed unto you but my Father in Heaven has revealed upon you and Upon This Rock I will build my church you need Revelation you need inspiration you've got to be upon you oh glory to God Hallelujah this is beautiful you may be seated praise God note Revelation bypass the intellect oh that's why you could be ignorant and learn and still have Revelation oh give the Lord a shot I feel good tonight glory to God you don't have an education you don't have to have all this amen degree in the message of the hour praise God but you have to have Revelation you have too much people know a lot but they have no Revelation whatsoever because Revelation is by faith faith is revelation private Enoch by fit Abel or foreign Hallelujah the word is God breathing it's God inspired he spoke by the prophets he's speaking by his son oh my notice oh here we go to whom he will reveal it so he saw design that he can hide himself in the scripture to the smartest illusion there is he can hide himself sit right there in the scripture and you look all day long and never see it it look a lifetime never see it he could hide himself sitting there oh let that soak in God in the wood can hide himself so in the world that there isn't that Theologian or school that could ever find him he said he hide it from a very elected theologians oh praise God elected teachers he hide it from them and the teaching teaching teaching teaching you know the teacher and the teacher teaching teaching with no Revelation the teaching what they know they're teaching from the intellectual level but not by the revelation of God or give the Lord some Praises that night I don't God hey oh man let's go Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Jesus Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what is God trying to do question this of Christ the mission of God revealed what is the new birth then you see well brother Branham what is newborn it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you [Music] because the Lord some praises all the intellectuals and the message stop right there they are moving from that they will preach that till they blew in the face but he said more not you join a church you shook a hand you learned something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else say what take place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it is it is Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built on so when Peter got that Revelation where Jesus said Upon This Rock have been my church if that was it Peter did not go to the upper room but he will not deny Jesus 27 times just three times over and over and over you understand that so Revelation is faith look if it is at the bottom or give the Lord some Praises glory to God do you get it now you need to be inspired to break into Faith which is the break into Revelation or break let's say from intellectual Faith to subconscious Faith or have faith most of the faith is intellectual or mental faith and he said yeah drop down in by the Holy Ghost operation and give you a spiritual Faith which is a rock and when they get that rock the delicate mover not old talk no no Whispering Pastor or Whispering Minister could move you and shake your horse this Revelation because you're you heard from your theophany you heard from your father you heard from Heaven you heard by inspiration okay the Lord some praise it was inspired to you oh glory to God thereby Jesus said Upon This Rock praise God build my church and the Gates of Hell praise God that's why we never deviated by the judge that's why we stood all these years Oh Glory to God not my movement of nothing I don't care who said what in Trinidad who don't like cool okay it doesn't matter what they say I'm standing by the Revelation what has been revealed to me oh glory to God is a prophetic Vision it's an open Vision okay the Lord Praise In The House Hallelujah glory to God so watch said the new birth it's the Revelation to you then he said from the ancient of the Lord he said the new birth is an experience so the intellectual gave Jessica revelation and people walk out with the knowledge information inside they're here this intellectable how to match up and break up and no change If any man be in Christ is a new creation All Things become new no change watch this now the new birth is an experience so it is a revelation but it's also an experience which one comes first is important the question that we ask which one comes first of course erosion come first and then the experience the new birth is an experience it's a gift of God it's a seal of your faith or a seal of your revelation could I hear a shout again on that it's a seal of your faith or a seal of your Revelation the same Revelation that God had to be sealed as many have received him by Revelation that them he gave power to become Oh Glory to God Heaven look you see Faith there on top of Faith as he virtue and virtue is power to become okay the Lord some Praises glory Lord God give the Lord a shout I'll say it again faith is a revelation a rock a anchor a certain point but upon that Revelation is a seal of the Holy Ghost which is power not adoption power yet power to pray power deliver holy life power to say I'm sorry power to repent power to amen that's what that power is for Oh Glory to God that's what the power is for you only know get started oh give the Lord a shout in the house started you know getting ready to be tested you know getting ready to be led into the Wilderness to face the devil and his Onslaught Give the Lord some Praises you can't go there in your flesh you cannot go there in yourself you have to be led by the spirit Into the Wilderness and he said that the dam is of this church will change the people of the calvary and then into the Rapture they're gonna drive it to die if they will die with his eyes you are what sit down and shut up you have to die or kill the Lord some Praises you let no bride hallelujah praise God you want to be bride oh God the bride goes flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of this world the blind no no message believer in the church the bride is the wife of the Lamb or give the Lord Our Praise flesh of his flesh born of his bone Oh Glory to God hallelujah he came for those who if on you that's why he come to call you glory to God we're not crazy tonight right all right here we go the new book is an experience it's a gift of God it's a seal of your feet the holy spirit is a seal yeah the holy spirit is what sealed Ephesians 14 he says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption God made Abraham the promise and Abraham believed God I was justified by faith and God gave him the sign of circumcision as a seal so he does today we believe him and then if you say you believe I do not receive the Holy Spirit then you do not believe because God promised to give you the Holy Spirit when you did believe now in believing you do not receive the Holy Spirit when you believe Paul asked in Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe it's a gift of God and then when the spirit of God comes into a man it quickens him and then he becomes a new creature he believes in the immortal God he believes he does all things his heart is tune with God how wonderful Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so we went out he said we were blind wretched miserable and by inspiration God give us a revelation of this message oh praise God praise God hallelujah do you see that now glory to God hallelujah God give us a revelation of this entire message God give us a revelation of Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah and that kept us all these years become other Catholic Commander Baptist come on our Methodist come out of Pentecostal we come around we come and be coming out but we have to go in locally if they lost some Praises glory to God and when God give you a revelation he could turn your wife against you because any husband against you he could tell him you're killing against you he will test that Revelation Revelation got to be tested came and say Amen somebody Revelation going to be tested every son that cometh Accord will be tested and whenever God give a revelation he will test that Revelation who give the Lord some prayer raises by the end of that test in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiply and multiply and by seed shall possess the case of the enemy or give the Lord some praise glory to God he will test you with people hating you and mistreating you but you've got to have brotherly kindness that has killed you because tell her to forgive them yes tell her to drop it against them and that helps you to die because there's Revelation you're working with Oh Glory with God you know you can hold that thought you know you can hold that Grudge I know Kevin's Mama father brother sister Uncle it doesn't matter who it is you gotta drop it and that helps kill you okay the Lord especially when you know you're right Hallelujah glory to God that's the quickening to you and Inspire to you this whole season seven Thunders amen power Amen to other virtues statue of a perfect man one of the quick and all these things it has to be quickened to the people that's under that and see now your Casino why the devil fight worship fight the atmosphere fight the spirit but I can't really fight in it because the devil don't mind people come and sit down and hear a message you know a message foreign stimulation rather than water amen glory amen here good word good word good word what a word what a word revolution when a vision make you want to run will get stimulated you see just another jump up there you know I jumped before because I see it I see why I do he could be ignorant and unlearned because Revelation bypasses senses who give the Lord a shout in the house a old man like Abraham had to believe in himself and his wife she's the old woman she don't have any child and Abraham to believe God for Sarah and he it bypass his senses and give him a hold upon God for 25 years come on wake up Insider here for 25 years he was waiting on the promise I am still waiting Oh Glory to God there's going to be adoption there are other Sons on the earth there's gonna be the gospel being preached which signs wonders and miracles or glory to God hallelujah under the ministry of the world but we break into the military of the spirit that's a different thing altogether it's the spirit that quickness oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah of God my God my question and answer 27th of May 1962. what Abraham was crying out where is that one that's going to sow that seed for that end time Church where is that ripening seed that promised Elijah you see that he know that she doesn't get rip you know first of all second pull third pull Elijah God told him do the work of an evangelist but he was born a prophet Hallelujah he had to do the worker in Francis until he was positionally placed and when he opened the 60s he was placed positionally called the world come to the prophet Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Christ himself the seventh seal came down unfold himself in that Elijah okay the Lord prays in other words the son of man revealing in Asana man the seven seal himself came down I saw An Almighty Angel come down Glory with a cloud a rainbow above his head holler at his son hallelujah hallelujah praise God and seven Thunders utterly voices seven messages seven voices Hallelujah came out of his mouth okay the Lord Our Praise Hallelujah Exclusive by promise to Canada right together to give the bride's hit seven Thunders lord of the Jesus Christ hey Hallelujah that wasn't from justinville that was on the Mount of God oh give the Lord some Praises that found you in Trinidad or give the Lord a shout we not preaching no crazy stuff we're not preaching fill a material we are preaching a message oh can the Lord some Praises by Revelation and by inspiration Hallelujah glory to God that Mighty angel came up with the open book it was no Pastor from nowhere it was not possible nowhere as the mighty angel came down with the book open Oh Glory to God and the book is open tonight and the voice said go to the angel that have that book and said give me the book and take it and eat it it will be inspired to you or give the Lord some Praises take it and eat it it will no glory to God [Applause] Glory what the ministers have done they take the worst and the preference from the from the people and they're bringing their own Revelation own inspiration I know the ministers the people connected the ministers than more than the worthy prophecy on the news I say people believe the Trump Mr Trump more than the baby family or the church all they want to know if Jesus go and walk what can I teach in Jesus have Jesus one week the minds will get prohibited right now they believe in a liar and they believe he's God man you know believe is God man is the world going crazy or what my goodness he said watch where is that one that's going to shoot at sea for the end time Church someone entering that liar from Manchester you're a liar but you say so where is that one so that seed seed for the Indian church we read it in our service or two ago I've been so zealous today so the right kind of a seed because the rain coming the real rain no no sprinkling no no sprinkling you know the real rain coming says that a matter of if there ain't coming you know the real rain coming and depend upon where can I see the things you have what kind of manifest you're gonna have worry where is that ripened seed that promised Elijah and immediately after his days shall the Great Tribulation set in and Bully it and then the return of the church and the bride the bride and Christ shall walk upon the ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and where they shall reign on the heathens that never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and sons of God will be manifested it's if he's a rain he's got to have someone to Reign Over he's got a domain and they rule and reign with Christ and Christ rule with a rodent and the Nations then the gospel then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here they will come in a millennium in that room oh my God I've watched for something but I'm speaking has it slipped Upon Us in humility and we miss it is it gone and Jesus life and a sin if that be so then it's later than you think if not prophets coming on if not there's coming one with a message that is straight on the Bible and a quick work will certainly eat the seeds will go in newspapers read the material until every predestinated seed of God has healed it none of them will come except the father draw them and everyone the father has drawn will hear it and come that will be the predestinated seed will hear the word so you are predestinancy like Christ was that's why I said don't forget that you're sitting here tonight you are predestinated seed that's why you're heard and received the word glory to God and then when that takes place it will be a gathering together and Jesus shall appear in other words the Thunders going to be unfolded there'll be a great Gathering seven Thunders will gather not the church the bride together that is in the contract oh give the Lord a shout in the house that is what is written no no millions of them nowhere Gathering the seven Thunders going to carry the pride together oh glory to God then that will take place it will be a gathering together and Jesus shall appear and will go to the church and from all over the Earth like that with the resurrection going up oh my hallelujah praise God hallelujah where are we at mine let's go now the seed must be planted then it must have water in order to grow now you say well brother Branham I'm going to express your thought here we have had the water so be it that's correct you have to have water you ever plant cabbage or anything or seeds and usually they got water just to pour a little on them now you say wait what did we have in that plant and time he answers it the foreign you say but around nonsense now wait a minute you take the word former in Jewel too and look at it in the Hebrew you go to the Hebrew and if you see it don't if you want to write it down it's m o u r e h Maury and get the Hebrew word interpret what more means it means teaching the teaching ring has went forward so there's a teaching room and we had that teaching room for 50 something years everybody teaching evangelist teaching and all have not everybody's Pastor have no evangelist and profits and than one everybody didn't but supposedly teaching the seeds all right here we go the international teaching women fought a minimum 144 back this one so members or robots and then Brothers where the Pentecostal move the great Pentecostal move the Cedars

the Lord Our Praise Glory the goddamn mysterious preachers go and fight with this kind of message they have to get a fight they're supposed to go fight no we left off where I give my thoughts on that whole thing will be that I believe the rain has been brought that's the reason we are quaint and ding dong quieting down because the ground is already sold over so when the ground is sold quiet relaxing time and then all of a sudden something Greek what's something now he said that season we are quieting down now because the ground is already sold over you can't find anywhere hardly what's been sown it went out to radio television tapes word everything is there soon the country now it is planted Seas no what seeds was planted you cannot get nothing else but what seas that was planted can you understand now it will be the seeds that's planted now are you ready Daisy patterns love him the spirit will fall I became much unbelief in Trinidad I don't care what the ministers preach what the minister said I don't want the minister Association think it doesn't matter you know this is the prophecy here there's this prophecy right here take that for you take that for your house take that for your family take that for your children take that for every issue in your life take that from the mountain before you take that for the Red Sea in front of you take that for whatever situation the spirit will fall and it will bring a harvest of the seed that it falls on so you better guard your heart and consider what seeds inside your heart or give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God be careful of the love Mother Pharisees my Florida gone there's a revival going on what is it a sowing Revival yes have a son Revival a stone Revival what you don't hear very much a Billy Graham no more what about all what about yourself then you know the great Revival fire not bullying what is it it's the end time seed sign the world have been shown what is it denomination will reap denomination that makes them Confederate themselves together but the word of God has been sown also and when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people [Applause] if this don't make you shout tonight I don't know what will decided I don't know what will when the spirit of will live in the people [Applause] oh can the Lord some Praises what's the secret the word is in the bride what's the secret God said that pick up your parents right and tell them the secret is the word is in the bride or there's gonna be a Rapture there's gonna be a resurrection there's going to be feeling and refill of the Holy Ghost there's gonna be a fire straight there glory to God amen amen amen that word repeating again and when the spirit of God begins to fall meet start a fall tonight may it fall on you may it fall here may it fall on you made for when you go to your house in your home made fall when you pray tonight when you pray in the morning oh glory to God Hallelujah on your way to the job or wherever and that false bride that committed adultery out there brought herself into Creeds and stolen some but right will reap what a confederation of church that's to be born like bones and prisons but where the word of God be sold into the people's heart yeah we see here we go where the word of God being sown into people's heart what did the parable says they are they that in an on his heart bring forth fruit with patience whole glory to God there's no way aside now there is not Stony this is not Tony this is good heart being fought through to Perfection or give the Lord some Praises glory to God but where the word of God have been sown into people's heart it will reap a bright for Christ as certain as I am standing here the prophets are certain as I'm standing here where the word of God we're not some minister is in people's heart no or some church and people are where the word of God is in people's hearts Hallelujah it will be bright for Christ as certainly I'm standing here glory to God Amen let's go Hallelujah he said Don't Look Back look forward keep moving on we have untapped resources [Laughter] untapped like a discovering fresh oil fresh gas hallelujah praise God untapped resources and then he he barely tap into they say no Jesus said in sin mark them 23. if you say to this mountain be moved and don't talk in your heart but believe that you have said it will come to pass you can have what you said no conditions it's Unlimited whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you received them and you shall have them that's Unlimited that's what the Bible says whatever Divine Healing joy peace everything now you see brother Branham what if we ask for something for somebody's life to be taken or some everything well you wouldn't really have Christian feet flirting like that Christian things to receive things from Christ you must all remember church God words are true and I believe the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it apart if you can look at it the right way but remember here has been my standard in life I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out is whether it's the will of God or not then I know it's God's will the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it then if it's the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith that will be done so he's also saying you cannotic will by objective and motive not right that's what this mean here you understand that because first is the will of God I have my objective is to glorify him my motive is to give him all the glory there's no selfish motives about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something it will never succeed when you try to do something outside the will of God it won't work to begin with so there's a genuine fate but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine faith I don't give a bomb here there is human feet and there's a fate of God so people have the power themselves by the human you know but that will have his limitation but there's a fate of God and you must have a Godly fit to believe and then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you then that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations all these things come by the mind of Christ being in you you get it let the mind of Christ to be in you oh praise God blessed be the name of the Lord Oh Glory to God to the Pentecostal goddamn mechanics and Dynamics and the spoken tongues in Azusa isn't that right praise God but but for our age we didn't have it so that God come and become and hear the word and there's fire that's all powerful no he brought a prophetic message in the learning of Christ that had to be taught that had to be unfolded in the seals he called him about the time of the revelation of these things they may known so God had all these Revelation to make it no it took time and along the time has been unfolded he calling people there are people who have gone on to be with the Lord in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s we're still here all alone from 1965 to now he said the message will go on print and newspapers and we'll go to every seed it took time to do that he's still calling people still delivering people isn't that right isn't that God but there's a promise of Dynamics to the bride it's not right hallelujah praise God praise God praise God all right let's go now here is a predisciplined plan in Plainview just as other seed the word of God is the seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you associate just throw it out in the ground I'll do no good the boys will pick it up you throw it out it will choke up pretty soon this probably said so so the ground here we go has to make me really feels are you ready now so God in Sovereign Grace be peers the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew You by his full knowledge and ordain you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you oh gift you couldn't miss it if you try or give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God oh this this ought to make a Baptist shout tonight glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when did he prepare you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew You by his foreknowledge and ordain you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered out of these things and then staggered into what you have now it was God leading you to the place where you're dying for you to be Oh Glory to God if the scrum isn't prepared before and it can't grow that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching Faith or discernment and see what take place oh praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord praise God let's continue here talking about job this man being a prophet he had access to God's grace but job didn't have bible to read but he had access to God by Revelation and by Vision that was before the Bible was written we find out and take some of his life God blessed him made him a great man everybody respected him even to his wisdom had become so great his inspiration from God had Vindicated him to be God's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to him and then Satan begin to accuse that man that's the way he does every inspired servant of God Satan is always there to accuse him of everything he does that's not right now we find out in his life on Charles his great faith even Jesus when he came on Earth he referred to the patience of Job he said have you not read the patience of Job faith and through that this is a revelation by Birmingham Faith Waits with patience for the promise of word to be fulfilled so Faith Warrior fatal quarreling free to find it breathing too long are fed up I can't take it no more I'm gonna come back slide Faith talking I say human talking say wait wait patience for the promise vote to be fulfilled Hallelujah like I've told you before a baby that's threatened and sick and crying lays upon the mother's breasts lose their strength back from her because it is satisfied while it is listening because the only access it has and knows is the mother's breast it knows no dose of medicine you might give him a dose a medicine you squeal and cry give him a shot in the arm he'll carry on but the only access to satisfy him is the mother's breast he said Abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are weighted up your manner is gone but I'm your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you are waiting be rested oh God Seven tunnels get fit your car tired hearing that the Dynamics of the mechanics you can't attack here in that praise God you shall receive power after Holy Ghost come upon you you got tired hearing that that's your promise God said so oh give the Lord some Praises there will be a church with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp you can get tired hearing that when the power of this church Rises it will bring the Brethren you got tired hearing that we'll give the Lord some Praises there will be a they can do whatever they want to do Glory stop being grumpy satisfied Glory that's the way with every believer no matter how bad the cancer got you how long you've been sitting in the wheelchair if you can't grasp that Revelation from God then be satisfied knowing it's going to happen because fate Waits patiently for the promise oh praise God this man job had no bible to read in his day watch no he only went by inspiration he was a prophet whom the word of the Lord comes to he's not right he only had to be inspired because you know this position that he was God's Prophet now the only thing had to happen was the inspiration to strike him then he knew what he said would happen because it was the inspiration Oh Glory to God and but around said his Supreme anointing is knowing what and how could you imagine you're being inspired to know what and how you walk inside the house for the mind of Christ because you know what to do and how to do it who praise God Supreme anointed you know that you know that you know that you know but give the Lord some Praises do you get that now you know that you know that you know that you know because the Supreme anointing is upon you you know what and you know how Oh Glory to God he said that's what the church if it's in order set in order it's only it got the mechanics he's prophesane it got the mechanics ready it only made them the Dynamics tonight if we only get the mechanics ready get our hearts right that's the first thing not all the mistreating you know not only forward teaching you know get our hearts right the things that we can do so if you know you have things to do to correct or repent or whatever it is you know it your mechanics are right yet when you know you do all that you could do that you could wait and they could be certain of God oh if your car haven't bought the devil can't move your your fat-footed praise God because you do all that we can do here we say no it's only the Dynamics tonight if we get the mechanics ready our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for Dynamics to be let off and only God can do that only who can do that oh only God can do that let me hear you are sending the Dynamics you mean they didn't know when it was going to come you'll be when the day of Pentecost was fully come they went one man and one Accord and all of a sudden here come Bishop so and so no all of a sudden a Russian Mighty Wind fill a whole house you mean that the same yesterday never ever you mean Peter himself didn't know what's going to happen in Cornelius house Peter began to testify and while Peter speak these words the same God we're talking about here The Same Spirit we're talking about here came down and sell upon them that heard the word Peter was not in charge of that okay the Lord some Praises hey hey hey hey Oh Glory to God that's why I could call me on a great expectation for God to do anything Among Us that's why how you supposed to become under great expectation because you're looking to be inspired God could change your heart change your walk change your talk amen and feel it with Holy Ghost and leave your completely transform be the protected leave here overshadowed with god oh glory to God watch here we go he said no get every mechanic ready and stand there and then we are ready for the Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's to drop into your heart that faith that says I am now healed then don't make a difference what circumstances is you're healed any harm it's feet you're healed praise God he job at a Channel of communication to God and that he got by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting God move in he know he was justified it was a gift a gift for the people not for job but for the people that's what all Divine gifts are to serve God's people oh praise God I'm going to step down quickly you know David was inspired all the people shouting and glorifying God for a reason that seemed exactly but he was the wrong person that inspiration should have come to Nathan not David he never even consulted Nathan you see does nothing till he reveal it to some of the prophets now job was this Prophet is this day the only thing God had done to job was always given wisdom his word and inspiration he could but he could get no inspiration but he knowed all his mechanics he had done he know what to do was right he couldn't get a word from God but the devil couldn't move him because he had a revelation oh give the Lord a praise because you need inspiration you know so that time they're going bone dry call it Quicks biscuit giant try Tokyo willingness right but you're looking for inspiration would you have to Jesus he was led by the spirits Into the Wilderness when the spirit led him he spread leave him alone you know he's dry wilderness he's trying if they'll be if they'll be you gotta be tested he can't be trusting anything floating for him where's that when he come out now so all all the experience coming upon him now so the anointing flowing is upon him dry dry dry dry overcome the devil and what happened after that the Bible said he returned in the power of the spirit the Spirit come down upon him what happened here the spirit upon him this guide himself as the word it's written written written written when you come here the spirit is upon me for he has anointed me ah oh give the Lord I shall do you see that now The Same Spirit become weird and deal with the Devil by the word it's written it's written it's written that's what we're doing right now you know praise God we have the spirit in word form it's written it's written seven times let's get Faith seven has got it right together seven understood Revival we tired hear that that's your business that's not for you like your church member this is for the bride walk in the Lord some Praises you don't have to hear it don't listen to it we want it it came out of Christ's mouth praise God Revelation 10 out of his mouth seven Thunders utter its voices oh give the Lord Our Praise do you see it now anointing hit Jesus Wilderness word word word word when he finished he came to the temple find the scripture and said the spirit is upon me for he hath anointed me in other words I'm inspired I am anointed I am commissioned to cast out Devils to open Blind Eye to raise the Dead Or Glory to God and the bride will have the spirit because revelation 22 17 is a prophecy the spirit and the bride say come or can the Lord I shout in the house the bride becomes the word the spirit becomes the anointing charity pillow fire voice of the Archangel gonna be upon a pride oh you talk about that glory to God time let me see if we can wrap up here Oh Glory to God he couldn't get a word from God but the devil couldn't move him now there is where you are when you're prayed for you don't have to run back to a line or go let somebody just pray for you when you know you have done exactly what God told you to do then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you I know I'm here then it drops into here let's continue are you ready will you take some more you're almost done after 10 pages and we're on page nine so we're going good all right let's go now you must realize then friend what condition you're in that's the reason I said this tip is to the church only if you have been called from Darkness into light from dead to life from former intellectual conception of Christ to a born-again experience and watching your life that it lays the things of the world inside and you standing for Christ regardless then something has happened there is something in you hungering and moving like Jacob you wrestle with the Lord you walk different after that something no here we go this is where I get inspiration from before it can be done it has it has to you are you ready I could stand here and preach till I got whatever here I got fell off till my shoulders stooped down and I was 90 years old and you listen every day until God Quicken that to you you are still in the same shape so they could press play from now to the tribulation period unless it becomes inspired same shape hearing preachers hearing word two days I've been studying and praying on this I said Lord what should I say to the church something said see it the aura is at hand I feel it's pulling me away pretty soon and I want you to know it no man can come to me and he spoke us right notice the fruits of the spirit now see it has to be quickened to you almost done when it come time for show them to unveil on God he said go get the sacrifice do anything in one person call upon your God when they cut themselves had another flesh jump up and down a lot of noise he said holy louder maybe God push you in somewhere he might be asleep you know what he said I'm a believing Jehovah so I can do this anymore no you don't you impersonate that don't even try to be like yourself God called you to be I'm a servant of Jehovah there's 700 of them down there too none of them dare to do it but when he cut the Bullock and poured water on it he said Lord Elijah now I have done this at your command anybody else could have tried it it would have been total failure because why it was inspired Elijah it's got to be inspired to you and the Holy Spirit has to bring it and make it manifest to you and that's what's the matter today you can't get up in the order and say well Hallelujah Lord I want Holy Ghost I don't know brother and sister when the Holy Ghost had inspired that word to you you will get it before you leave your seat foreign [Applause] even Jesus himself he said I do not what I want to do my Within Myself the son can do nothing but what he sees the father doing he was Emmanuel himself he was going on here Jesus was he was the flesh that God dwelled in he was the tent that God live under but all of that the Virgin born son of God Emmanuel in the fullness of the spirit he was the spirit of the measure yet he said I do nothing until the father chose me first inspired him to do it so Jesus himself was saying I'm waiting for inspiration to do this thing my father shows me first isn't that right there are too many trying to impersonate different things of the Lord you can't do that that things comes by election God's calling you are dropped from your mother's womb with that peace and calling about repentance that's true you can't make yourself something you're not but if God calls you listen take this to her tonight if God calls you be the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you as I would speak if I had time the squirrels the other day I'd turn me around I never seen her before I say I couldn't do it right there looking at me but how could that ever happen it could not have been done but it was inspired it was quickened the world was spoke and it was so oh praise God we're gonna finish the home stretch here now glory to God whenever I'm brought this out you know when ail by inspiration come no Beauty but they come in Inspiration he had no Bibles to tell him it was a lamb but God revealed to him it was a lamb Oh Glory to God isn't that right today people think the same thing the channel missions they'll use reason and King but offering he said and so forth the gospel being preached people shun it they don't they want to act like the world and be like the world like the woman because of its reasoning you can't go by that c is by inspiration and then he read the scripture we read who the man said the son of Manama and so like that he said and and Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed to you I'll skip that all right that's what the shanamite woman was doing it was unreasonable to take a dead baby to the preacher's bed but inspiration spoke and if the inspiration speak to you that you have been playing church if inspiration tells you tonight it's time to get rid of your dirty habits listen to the inspiration it is the holy spirit speaking and making our way don't never turn it down oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God if your faith can't go into action you'll all be in that wheelchair but when your faith can take action Museum come please but when your faith can take action to a place that dungen your soul that says so not reason but something and yes something going to take place oh God when your feet begin to take action glory to God Amen finish what about when Elijah was crossed Jordan he said what I'll do one for you what's a double portion of your spirit be sent upon me he said he asks a great thing God wants us to ask for big things he don't run all the blessings up there you can ask for too much I feel we asked him too little you know yeah could you imagine a little fish about that long in the middle ocean saying I better not drink much of this thing because it might go dry you say ask for double portion praise the name of the Lord praise God okay hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus he said they might frustrate you because they're trying to agree with their reasonings but don't in their heart they admire unless their soul associate till they have nothing but reason for if you are a real Christian Living a true life living the word of God with you everybody will admire it if his soul is in touch with god oh praise God he said you have seen it a man pick up a certain scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live new make it live exactly what it promised you in the Bible begin to pray something and the next man will see him do it and he will come around and try to do it and feel I hope you're reading me now he'll feel why the scripture is not inspired to him he's only trying to impersonate and that is the Bible reading Giants and jambres destined Moses Jester jamres and Moses stood on a rod become a serpent and pharaoh and you know carry on he said just like super century they say that was for another day they are all together out but watch this spirit in the last days go to impersonate the real Spirit there is where trouble coming [Music] like the one that's real but they couldn't make it manifest so friends we are here it got to be inspired to you the devil fighting inspiration but this is what's going to make the difference men who are inspired and men who are not Simeon was inspired David was inspired that why David Tootsie I'll cut your head off and run to make Goliath you have to get into the channel of God for the inspiration to stratulations Father God we praise you and bless you and thank you for your word Lord Jesus as I share with the people Lord if they are not inspired they're in the same shape so we pray God at the anointing the inspiration which strike the season lies of the people and they will see
