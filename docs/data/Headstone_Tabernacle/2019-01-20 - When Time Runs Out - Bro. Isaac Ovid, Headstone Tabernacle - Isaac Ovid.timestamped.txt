[1:07:32] this morning amen so before you take
[1:07:35] your seats
[1:07:36] alight to get to the scriptures reading
[1:07:38] two portions of Scripture both in the
[1:07:42] book of Revelation reading revelation 10
[1:07:44] and reading from Revelation chapter 22
[1:07:48] for scripture reading this morning
[1:07:52] looking for God to do something special
[1:07:54] for us in this season
[1:08:02] revelation 10 and reading from verse 1
[1:08:06] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:08:09] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:08:12] rainbow was upon his head that his face
[1:08:14] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:08:18] pillars of fire and he had it his hand
[1:08:20] little book open and he set his right
[1:08:23] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[1:08:25] the earth and cry with a loud voice as
[1:08:28] when a lion roars and when he had cried
[1:08:31] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[1:08:34] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:08:35] their voices I was about to write and I
[1:08:38] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[1:08:40] seal up those things which the seven
[1:08:43] thunders uttered and write them not and
[1:08:46] he enjoyed which I saw stand upon the
[1:08:48] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:08:50] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:08:53] liveth for ever and ever who created
[1:08:55] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:08:57] and the earth and the things that
[1:08:59] therein are and the sea and the things
[1:09:00] which are therein that there should be
[1:09:03] time no longer but in the days of the
[1:09:05] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:09:07] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:09:10] be finished as he had declared to his
[1:09:12] servants the prophets and reading
[1:09:14] revelation 22 and reading verse 10
[1:09:19] and he said unto me seal not the sayings
[1:09:21] of the prophecy of this book for the
[1:09:25] time is at hand
[1:09:27] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:09:30] still and he which is filthy let him be
[1:09:34] filthy still and he that is righteous
[1:09:37] let him be righteous still and he that
[1:09:40] is holy let him be holy still me the
[1:09:43] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:09:46] the word you may be seated this morning
[1:09:52] so I have a title this morning and I
[1:09:56] believe I told buddy Hugh on Wednesday
[1:09:58] night that is about true but over two
[1:10:02] weeks or so ago that the Lord gave me
[1:10:05] this thought this message for today and
[1:10:08] remember it over preached two weeks ago
[1:10:11] the last message the last Commission the
[1:10:15] last name I spoke with him and I said I
[1:10:18] know what I have is to follow a message
[1:10:21] and then he continued along the same
[1:10:24] vein last Sunday where as I was with
[1:10:27] Moses so shall I be with thee but within
[1:10:30] that message he has a theme of the last
[1:10:32] message the last Commission the last
[1:10:34] name because the Prophet says one of
[1:10:36] these days a last name will be called
[1:10:39] they all will be shot and it'll be all
[1:10:41] over
[1:10:42] similar to Noah's day that God shut the
[1:10:45] door Noah had no control over God
[1:10:48] shutting the door and last Wednesday we
[1:10:51] had an exotic on and pray meeting and we
[1:10:54] spookin come thou and thy house into the
[1:10:57] ark and we see the signs we see the
[1:11:00] political signs you see the economic
[1:11:01] signs we see the signs in disguise I
[1:11:04] believe later tonight or so there should
[1:11:06] be a total lunar eclipse call it a Blood
[1:11:08] Moon and they have different names for
[1:11:10] it I could take an hour and talk about
[1:11:12] that but the signs in the skies that's
[1:11:16] that's we have a we have the sign of the
[1:11:18] wood
[1:11:19] and we know that those signs in the
[1:11:21] skies because we're Branum taught us
[1:11:22] that there are three Bibles the heavens
[1:11:24] the pyramids and the written word and we
[1:11:27] want to feast on the Word of God because
[1:11:29] that is what prepares us we could spend
[1:11:31] a lot of time talking about the
[1:11:32] political situation and yes brother
[1:11:35] Branham preached on modern events made
[1:11:36] clear by prophecy but the word that has
[1:11:39] gone forth for us is not for us to labor
[1:11:42] on what's happening around us it's for
[1:11:44] us to labor and what's happening inside
[1:11:45] of us because we could have all
[1:11:48] knowledge of what's happening around us
[1:11:49] what's happening in the political realm
[1:11:51] what's happening in the ecclesiastical
[1:11:53] realm and still miss what is most
[1:11:56] important that is a change on the inside
[1:11:58] of us and for some reason or the other
[1:12:01] and it's something I believe I said on
[1:12:03] Wednesday night that the whole purpose
[1:12:04] of coming to church is for us to change
[1:12:06] for us to mature and the maturity that
[1:12:09] comes with this God saw and has an order
[1:12:12] for how it's supposed to take place so
[1:12:14] for you to even manifest the virtue of
[1:12:16] the age of brotherly kindness you have
[1:12:18] to be around people who can test you for
[1:12:21] that virtue to be manifested you can
[1:12:23] hide on a mountain and be in solitary
[1:12:26] confinement or self-imposed solitary
[1:12:28] confinement and get brotherly kindness
[1:12:30] because there's nobody testing you so
[1:12:32] God made it in such a way that you have
[1:12:34] to interact with people good people nice
[1:12:36] people Christian people wonderful people
[1:12:39] but they invariably have to rub you the
[1:12:41] wrong way God designed it that way so
[1:12:44] that the virtue could be manifested so
[1:12:46] hiding and having a problem with people
[1:12:48] and when problems arise with people
[1:12:50] having positions and things to say about
[1:12:53] it you are actually going around away
[1:12:55] instead of going through the path that
[1:12:57] God ordained for you for your own
[1:12:59] perfection for your own maturity for
[1:13:01] your own growth and when you look back
[1:13:04] at your life you must be able to see
[1:13:06] that you are graduating from stage to
[1:13:07] stage to seed you must be making
[1:13:09] progress you cannot stay in standard one
[1:13:11] for all of your life after standard one
[1:13:14] shall be standard to understand the two
[1:13:16] so take you all the way up to Common
[1:13:17] Entrance of what what do they call it
[1:13:19] now a CA
[1:13:20] and then he's was a past one that's
[1:13:23] teacher another stage when I was a child
[1:13:26] I speak as a child but when they became
[1:13:27] a man I put away the childish things
[1:13:29] there's a time limit to the stages of
[1:13:31] your life and time is something that we
[1:13:34] will not have all the time Oh help me
[1:13:38] just want to encourage you this money
[1:13:40] want to push you and prod you unto good
[1:13:43] works that's what we came to church for
[1:13:45] and people want to bypass the process
[1:13:48] and the Bible says for seek not the
[1:13:49] assembling of yourselves together even
[1:13:52] as if they approaching so when we come
[1:13:53] together it's not by accident it's not
[1:13:55] by chances not because we want to do
[1:13:58] something but because we are compelled
[1:13:59] to do something because God not only has
[1:14:02] something to say to us he has an
[1:14:04] experience that we have when we come
[1:14:07] into an upper room like environment
[1:14:08] because God wants the distribute his
[1:14:11] Holy Ghost so different individuals
[1:14:13] different gifts different gifts and
[1:14:15] every gift has the finest place and
[1:14:17] every member of the body has something
[1:14:19] to do and if you don't know what you
[1:14:21] have to do yet wait until your change
[1:14:22] comes because when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:14:24] it comes to defeat the mechanics the
[1:14:27] purpose the call of God upon your life
[1:14:29] that the devil has fought all these
[1:14:31] years to thwart the devil as for all
[1:14:33] these he has to distract you and not
[1:14:35] that you realize that you have a high
[1:14:36] calling that you may not understand but
[1:14:38] is still a high calling that you may not
[1:14:41] realize but it's still a high calling in
[1:14:43] Christ Jesus not for your own agenda not
[1:14:47] based on your own interpretation not
[1:14:49] based on your own ambition but based on
[1:14:51] what God wrote about you we are living
[1:14:54] out what God has written about us we can
[1:14:57] live nothing else but what God has
[1:14:59] written about us and what God has
[1:15:01] written about us must stand up what God
[1:15:03] has written about us must be
[1:15:05] accomplished so when the doctor says
[1:15:07] something contrary to what the doctor to
[1:15:10] what God wrote about us then that
[1:15:12] becomes a lie when our school teacher
[1:15:15] says something to us that's not what God
[1:15:18] said about us then the teacher is a lie
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:22] and the church amen hallelujah my you
[1:15:27] maybe season you send the pulpit to get

[1:15:58] come for this is what we come to do when
[1:16:00] we come to church we are reminded of our
[1:16:02] high calling we are reminded that we are
[1:16:04] a royal priesthood we as a people a
[1:16:07] royal priesthood each one of us writer
[1:16:10] priests we are of the tribe of Levites
[1:16:13] we are royal priests actor enter into
[1:16:16] the Holies of Holies
[1:16:17] before Jesus came only the high priest
[1:16:19] could go in there but when Jesus came

[1:16:24] giving every one of us access into the
[1:16:27] goodness of God given us ask what we
[1:16:31] will whatever it is what we will and see
[1:16:34] it come to pass and in my name they cast

[1:21:44] cannot take a man she ready
[1:21:46] somebody help me preach this morning
[1:21:50] UMUC the young people that's why when
[1:21:53] you go to a job and you go to different
[1:21:55] situations you can never be happy in the
[1:21:57] world because the seat has already been
[1:22:00] sold and that she can only produce
[1:22:02] itself for either when you fall and you
[1:22:05] make mistake that seed cannot produce a
[1:22:07] carnal church that sees a central church
[1:22:09] that she can only produce one of these
[1:22:11] visions that she can only produce I
[1:22:13] wanna go survival so even when you're
[1:22:15] covered in the mud and the devil thinks
[1:22:17] you're finished you might Oh shucks done
[1:22:20] finish that seed that was there before
[1:22:23] you were born and stream it out out
[1:22:26] coming out coming out
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:42] maybe you see them
[1:22:46] I feel good this morning I feel good
[1:22:49] this morning you supposed to feel good
[1:22:52] too
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:23:02] the promise of restoration of this
[1:23:05] church is not to have it was 10 years
[1:23:08] ago not how it was 20 years ago not have
[1:23:11] it was in 19 or the 80s the restoration
[1:23:14] of this church it's not even 2 when the
[1:23:16] Prophet was here
[1:23:17] the restoration of this church is to the
[1:23:19] Alpha Church the original Church the
[1:23:24] original Pentecost the original Church
[1:23:26] where Peter said these men are not drunk
[1:23:28] as you suppose
[1:23:29] since that time every eight have been
[1:23:32] pointed back to that age and the church
[1:23:34] same and let me say bring back the old
[1:23:37] time do you don't even know what I'm
[1:23:38] talking about because we were not there
[1:23:40] but when you read the scriptures about
[1:23:42] what was there that was a different kind
[1:23:44] of church god help us get that kind of a
[1:23:47] church Weston cannot stay in the church
[1:23:49] were you walking and your sinners expose
[1:23:52] you you have to pray before him you
[1:23:54] don't want to leave your house without
[1:23:56] praying because you know the Holy Ghost
[1:23:59] will uncover whatever is intactness will
[1:24:01] come to light because the season change
[1:24:05] and it's amen
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:14] everybody feeling funny
[1:24:16] Oh mine put on your seatbelts don't
[1:24:22] don't take a seatbelt off
[1:24:23] I told the Deacons a couple weeks ago
[1:24:26] make sure nobody just walking around
[1:24:27] aimlessly and know-it-all poopers dances
[1:24:29] and stuff make sure people keep your
[1:24:31] seatbelts on
[1:24:31] we don't want to miss the destination do
[1:24:35] want to miss way why I come to say this
[1:24:37] is not a social gathering you know this
[1:24:40] is not a club is not a community you
[1:24:42] know this is an army and every man must
[1:24:45] take his rap every man must be nurse
[1:24:47] please every man must be nurses ition
[1:24:51] the maturing and the growth for us is
[1:24:54] the bring us to be well established in
[1:24:56] opposition can the church say Amen and
[1:25:00] it's something in growth because even my
[1:25:02] own walk and I'm looking at things and
[1:25:04] I'm I'm seen in a certain way and that's
[1:25:06] a challenge because by the Branum said
[1:25:08] God don't make halfway preachers but a
[1:25:11] preacher could be halfway God don't make
[1:25:13] halfway Christians but a Christian could
[1:25:15] be halfway and I realize where a lot of
[1:25:18] people missed it because God give gifts
[1:25:21] but gifts our doubt repentance so men
[1:25:27] for years and the message to rely on
[1:25:30] just their gift and you can have a
[1:25:33] mighty ministry on just a gift but
[1:25:36] there's more than just the gifts because
[1:25:38] Paul wouldn't tell Timothy to study to
[1:25:41] show yourself approved so even with a
[1:25:43] gift you have to study to see spend the
[1:25:47] time to get into the secret things of
[1:25:50] God and spend time in a secret closet
[1:25:53] them and you can have a gift you could
[1:25:54] have knowledge you could study and still
[1:25:56] miss the anointing because we're the
[1:25:58] balance ed got to be annoying thing from
[1:26:00] him for five years but when you get the
[1:26:02] gift with the study with the anointing
[1:26:05] with the grace of God with the season
[1:26:08] the spiritually put together the word
[1:26:10] spiritual food in due season then the
[1:26:13] chains to break off of your life because
[1:26:16] God is a present tense God is not a
[1:26:18] gorgeous of yesterday yes
[1:26:20] he's not just a corner tomorrow but
[1:26:22] today chains are being broken that their
[1:26:25] demons are shaken in your life and they
[1:26:27] have to let you go because the world is
[1:26:29] not just come in that's the pork the
[1:26:32] waters with power and to have a real
[1:26:36] demonstration in your life and the
[1:26:39] church shaming everybody feeling fine
[1:26:44] and because of this week we have now
[1:26:47] understood clearer than before that God
[1:26:50] has an order there's a way that court
[1:26:53] operates and there's a way we have to
[1:26:55] operate in this army of the Lord because
[1:26:57] God doesn't break his order to anybody
[1:27:02] come the church say Amen so just talk a
[1:27:10] little bit today is that fine
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:15] from a message of blushing profits and
[1:27:17] for my title this morning before I get
[1:27:20] to that might at least when time runs
[1:27:23] out when time runs out when time runs
[1:27:32] out sometimes we live life as if we have
[1:27:38] all the time in the world some of us we
[1:27:42] have an appointment to be at a certain
[1:27:46] place at a certain time and we act as if
[1:27:50] we have all the time in the world and
[1:27:52] that's why we're late when you have an
[1:27:59] exam to do there's a time given to an
[1:28:02] exam sometime it's 90 minutes two hours
[1:28:06] it depends on the examination but after
[1:28:10] a while time begins to run out
[1:28:20] powerful thought huh
[1:28:23] tanda not always exists because god is
[1:28:26] eternal so time has a beginning and
[1:28:31] because it has a beginning but the
[1:28:33] random taught us anything that has a
[1:28:35] beginning has to have an ending and we
[1:28:38] read the scripture that see a mighty
[1:28:40] angel come down from heaven and later on
[1:28:44] in verse 6 he said declare that time no
[1:28:46] longer no more time no more time friends
[1:28:57] time is coming to an end and when you
[1:29:03] look through history every single thing
[1:29:06] you thought he was going to be premise
[1:29:08] forever you know when you hit premise
[1:29:10] school that was world but that time run
[1:29:14] out
[1:29:16] and I said to somebody yesterday I said
[1:29:18] no matter what comes in your life you
[1:29:21] cannot ignore the challenges the
[1:29:23] situation that come you can't ignore
[1:29:24] them because when you close the eye you
[1:29:27] wake up in the morning if you don't deal
[1:29:29] with it it's still a what you
[1:29:34] the ostrich is the animal that when it
[1:29:37] sees a problem you know what the
[1:29:38] ostriches
[1:29:41] it digs in a small hole puts his head
[1:29:46] into the hole and tries to will the
[1:29:49] problem a week I'm I don't know how to
[1:29:54] describe if it has a heart or what but
[1:29:58] if the ocean has a heart he's praying
[1:30:01] then when he lifts his head back up the
[1:30:04] problem will not be there and invariably
[1:30:07] when you raise the head back up the
[1:30:10] problem is still there anybody with me
[1:30:16] this morning so let me get it to my text
[1:30:21] and then I'll hit my title later on
[1:30:22] right so in a blessing profits it ought
[1:30:24] to be the happiest time in the world for
[1:30:26] the Christian I heard somebody speaker
[1:30:30] miss a couple days ago and he said you
[1:30:31] know the problem is we have too many
[1:30:32] Christians who cannot inspire anybody
[1:30:36] because your head scrape any floor you
[1:30:40] sure look like something on your
[1:30:41] shoulder
[1:30:42] and you will wonder what experience you
[1:30:45] had with God because you're not smiling
[1:30:47] and and listen smiling is not based on
[1:30:51] your current situation smiling is based
[1:30:53] on your relationship with God
[1:30:59] smiling is based on your perspective of
[1:31:02] your situation and we give the story of
[1:31:04] the person was complaining because he
[1:31:06] had no shoes and he stopped complaining
[1:31:09] when he saw the person with no feet his
[1:31:12] perspective change because he saw things
[1:31:14] a bit differently but many times our
[1:31:17] eyes are not fixed on God and our eyes
[1:31:20] and a pixel are calling so we look
[1:31:23] around us and we are influenced by these
[1:31:25] things and we miss the blessing that God
[1:31:28] has carried us through and because God
[1:31:30] is not obligated to explain to us all
[1:31:33] that he's doing for us
[1:31:36] can I say that again God is not
[1:31:38] obligated to tell us all he's doing for
[1:31:41] us so when you miss the accident on the
[1:31:44] road and God is good I visited the
[1:31:45] captain I hit you and you did reading
[1:31:48] your papers you missed her and you don't
[1:31:49] even just working overtime and you and
[1:31:51] you wanna walk sad you wanna walk
[1:31:55] depressed
[1:31:57] you may be seated there are many stories
[1:32:00] I've heard and it's one of a young lady
[1:32:03] she was walking through some area and
[1:32:05] that area there are some guys who were
[1:32:08] rubbing the people in the area and she
[1:32:11] walked through and when she got to the
[1:32:13] other side and so on so people who asked
[1:32:15] her well how come didn't rub you and
[1:32:18] when they act the guys who were doing
[1:32:20] the rubbin why all he didn't rub that
[1:32:22] little girl who was vulnerable is it she
[1:32:24] was not alone
[1:32:26] she was walking with she was walking
[1:32:28] with two other people I saw two big
[1:32:36] strong fellows walking with her we're
[1:32:39] not shopping why we would go and mess
[1:32:41] with her when she have two people with
[1:32:43] her winners shop when we looking for
[1:32:44] easier targets listen you were not a
[1:32:46] easy target
[1:32:47] nothing could come your way unless God
[1:32:50] allows it you are like Jail unless God
[1:32:53] kept the devil permission he cannot come
[1:32:56] to your house
[1:33:04] you may be seated so if the devil has
[1:33:09] come on your street to come to your
[1:33:11] house it means that God says it's okay
[1:33:14] to give him a shot but I know that
[1:33:16] that's my boy I know that's my daughter
[1:33:19] I know he will stand I know she gonna
[1:33:22] have a testimony you could take his job
[1:33:25] you could take his family but he was
[1:33:27] still worship me you may be seated
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:42] I pray you maybe see that this morning
[1:33:45] God opens your spiritual eyes when your
[1:33:53] carnal it looked at me in flesh you see
[1:33:55] everything in the flesh you see a bank
[1:33:57] account in a flash you look at it
[1:34:00] doctor's report in the flesh listen
[1:34:02] there are more zeros on your corn and
[1:34:04] you see but I say never leave man
[1:34:08] they don't believe me there are more
[1:34:12] zeros on your account and you could see
[1:34:14] because he promises supply all of your
[1:34:17] needs according to his riches and glory
[1:34:20] forget what the banker telling you you
[1:34:23] have a bigger bank account you don't
[1:34:25] need a big set of money to go to the
[1:34:27] doctor you don't need a big settlement
[1:34:29] no because you have access to the best
[1:34:32] doctor you have access to do you know
[1:34:35] how much money it is to get the best
[1:34:37] doctor you initiative you much money it
[1:34:39] is the highly best lawyer when a
[1:34:41] situation come your way and you have
[1:34:43] enough money on your account because you
[1:34:46] have a ring of predestination to get the
[1:34:48] best lawyer somebody help me this
[1:34:51] morning to get me best doctor when you
[1:34:54] have a situation with your child is
[1:34:56] because you in your flesh that you try
[1:34:58] to get into the mix of it instead of
[1:35:01] letting God sent out his police you may
[1:35:03] receive it or some money
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:09] that's the confidence that will make the
[1:35:11] men of all said the battle is not it's
[1:35:14] not mine the battle is the Lord's and
[1:35:17] you know why he doesn't for his namesake
[1:35:20] because his name is important to him and
[1:35:23] he don't want the enemy to ever think
[1:35:25] that he can't keep his word he keeps his
[1:35:27] what about you
[1:35:28] even when you didn't deserve it he keeps
[1:35:30] his word for his name sake he will bless
[1:35:34] you for his name sake he will deliver
[1:35:37] you for his name's sake because he said
[1:35:40] he'll to it unconditional covenant
[1:35:44] that's what unconditional means it's not
[1:35:47] based on your actions it's based on what
[1:35:50] he said he will do he may be seated
[1:35:59] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:36:04] that's why the head strong will come
[1:36:07] with sodium's crying grace grace grace
[1:36:09] because Adam proved that when it was a
[1:36:12] two sided relationship God didn't ban
[1:36:15] the Gordon mandate Manfield
[1:36:22] and God said you know what let's be an
[1:36:24] unconditional relationship his love is
[1:36:29] unconditional his love doesn't cheap
[1:36:32] when you make mistakes his love for you
[1:36:34] is just calling you back to repentance
[1:36:36] calling you back to Greece calling you
[1:36:38] back to make things right calling you
[1:36:40] back to say that I'm sorry he's not
[1:36:42] gonna allow you now and don't mix up his
[1:36:45] grace with you doing foolishness his
[1:36:53] grace is to deal with you when you fall
[1:36:55] when you couldn't help yourself not when
[1:36:58] you deliberate you walk in the show
[1:36:59] business can the church say man you can
[1:37:07] set some time ago I said listen even the
[1:37:10] devil game blame for stuff you didn't do
[1:37:13] you choose to eat hamburger but a whole
[1:37:15] set up a patria many morning wake up
[1:37:18] Sunday morning your stomach hurts in the
[1:37:19] city devil Tiger Beat ever didn't I tell
[1:37:21] you up
[1:37:24] you have to know wisdom you have to know
[1:37:28] what the devil might try to get you to
[1:37:29] eat and know they say well I'm not
[1:37:30] eating that tonight because tomorrow is
[1:37:32] but the fast some of you don't even
[1:37:33] know what fasteners because you want to
[1:37:38] be ready for war you want to be ready
[1:37:41] for action I want to be ready because
[1:37:44] you realize we're in a spiritual war or
[1:37:46] rest or war it's not carnal it's not
[1:37:47] it's not flesh and blood so when your
[1:37:50] wife asked about your husband a
[1:37:51] curvature now it's not flesh and blood
[1:37:52] go and pray go and pray and what's got
[1:37:57] you in the situation around what go to
[1:37:59] something
[1:38:01] your default responsibly pray you are
[1:38:07] automatic your default setting should be
[1:38:09] prayer when you reset to defaults prayer
[1:38:14] when you feel upset pray when you feel
[1:38:17] tired pray when you feel very pretty
[1:38:20] when you feel sick break
[1:38:28] so I'm taking my time this morning come
[1:38:32] here in the presence of the Lord so I
[1:38:35] just wanna lay a foundation and get to
[1:38:37] my thoughts and see what God will do
[1:38:38] today but in my heart the Lord knows my
[1:38:41] heart I don't want to see anybody leave
[1:38:42] here today deceive me that they keep
[1:38:45] there must be a change it must be a call
[1:38:48] to something to move on the inside for
[1:38:50] us to create a revival and the revival
[1:38:52] it's not started in the church it's in
[1:38:54] your homes but you kind of get desperate
[1:38:59] by the Branson until God speaks to you
[1:39:01] so may God speak to your heart today so
[1:39:04] that you could do more to see your
[1:39:05] family deliver to see your situation
[1:39:07] change because the word has compelled
[1:39:09] you not motivation not jumping and
[1:39:11] shouting but a real introspection let
[1:39:13] every man examine himself and see am i
[1:39:17] living up to the expectation as set by
[1:39:19] the Prophet we have a standard we're not
[1:39:21] trying to create a standard we already
[1:39:22] have a standard but if Adam brought a
[1:39:24] standard and God does not change so this
[1:39:26] standard has not been lowered or dropped
[1:39:28] it's a same standard the standard of
[1:39:31] holiness it's a standard of
[1:39:32] righteousness it's a standard of purity
[1:39:34] it's a standard of love it's a standard
[1:39:37] of living the right way can the church
[1:39:41] say Amen it ought to be the happiest
[1:39:44] time in the world for the Christian
[1:39:45] times are going to change the all's
[1:39:47] gonna become young oh my dad's gonna fit
[1:39:50] away sickness will be no more no more
[1:39:53] prayer meetings for the sick no more
[1:39:55] prayer meetings for the loss but God
[1:39:56] shall come and take the elect from the
[1:39:59] four winds of the earth and shall gather
[1:40:01] them under his own wings and we live and
[1:40:03] reign with him forever in his heaven oh

[1:40:27] living at the standard but you're
[1:40:30] supposed to be at
[1:40:31] but the man said you don't know that

[1:40:36] and if you know you're not way you

[1:40:46] not only see but to stay here until God
[1:40:49] has cleansed your soul from everything
[1:40:52] that's unlike him and I was speaking

[1:42:14] for a new hope a new life and you walk
[1:42:18] and you talk and you perspective and you
[1:42:21] a fresh anointing listen to the Prophet
[1:42:26] go out with the baptism of the holy
[1:42:28] spirit go out not shouting not dancing
[1:42:31] so much them things are alright they all
[1:42:33] belong in the church you all belong in
[1:42:35] the Bible but I'm talking about is the
[1:42:38] Holy Spirit God's love
[1:42:40] that's what we're looking for quartz
[1:42:44] love come to church say Amen
[1:42:45] but I Brandon and a mighty golden vilem
[1:42:47] identify with a group that feels of
[1:42:49] Spirit of God I make 10 if ever that
[1:42:51] group that knows he's unfilled that
[1:42:53] knows he's a seen yesterday today and
[1:42:55] forever and know that this is not
[1:42:57] fanaticism it's Jesus Christ is him
[1:42:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:43:01] I'm identified with that group here
[1:43:03] tonight yet they called a bunch of
[1:43:05] heretics he has a bunch of fanaticism on
[1:43:08] account of the Word of God but I'm not
[1:43:10] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:43:12] but it's the power of God unto salvation
[1:43:16] what are we looking for this is our
[1:43:18] promise a church that Jesus don't walk
[1:43:20] into a kind of church that God's prophet
[1:43:23] longed to see a church full of power I
[1:43:26] choose I will unite with the head stoner
[1:43:28] Joseph knows that Jesus Christ is the
[1:43:30] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:43:33] believe it all my heart and we will have
[1:43:35] that kind of a church can the church see
[1:43:40] so for such a time as this
[1:43:42] we have been raised up
[1:43:48] God overlooked Abraham God overlooked
[1:43:52] even God overlooked Joshua God went and
[1:43:55] searched true and he saw you like John
[1:43:57] he said no they can't deal with this age
[1:43:59] their mission their purpose their
[1:44:01] ministry is for their time I need to
[1:44:03] find a different group of people who
[1:44:05] could deal with this age of the Internet
[1:44:07] and this interferes book and this age of
[1:44:09] technology and it's and still have a
[1:44:11] testimony and still in this is be able
[1:44:14] to tell the devil no I'm not gonna
[1:44:16] report to you I'm not gonna answer to
[1:44:18] you I don't have to explain myself to
[1:44:21] you
[1:44:22] somebody please back to me and they'll
[1:44:27] be contrast that time is short you
[1:44:33] cannot come to church like you have all
[1:44:34] the time you cannot come to church like
[1:44:38] every time any would but if I said one
[1:44:40] day really last song son will have the
[1:44:43] last service and I preached the message
[1:44:45] a long time ago to the young people do
[1:44:47] not cross the line and but I'm and I'm
[1:44:48] talked about young people coming to the
[1:44:50] altar when I read this quote it had me
[1:44:55] spinning in fact let me see if I could
[1:44:58] pull it up
[1:44:59] quickly for you
[1:45:05] is that okay
[1:45:15] it wasn't a message at deity of Jesus
[1:45:17] Christ but a madam said I'm thinking of
[1:45:20] those young people that night down there
[1:45:23] at the altar listen friends at the altar
[1:45:26] trying to be saved but had crossed the
[1:45:30] line no redemption for them they were
[1:45:32] gone could not be saved and people come
[1:45:36] to church acting as if this salvation
[1:45:39] and this mercy and this Redemption is an
[1:45:41] indefinite thing bigger better brand
[1:45:45] said this each we are blending from time
[1:45:47] into eternity salvation is not required
[1:45:50] in eternity redemptions are required in
[1:45:52] eternity you need to be scenery team to
[1:45:54] get there so when we brand into eternity
[1:45:58] and as we are blending in there'll be a
[1:46:01] line and is drawn as we read the
[1:46:04] scripture in revelation 22 he let his
[1:46:07] filthy filthy still he let his righteous
[1:46:11] righteous still and people on the scene
[1:46:14] enough time to come to church when the
[1:46:18] prophets cleaner is later than we think
[1:46:20] has got me scared have I done enough

[1:46:40] church under the greatest ministry of
[1:46:43] the Prophet message of Malachi 4 can we
[1:46:47] give an account for what this message
[1:46:50] has done to bring us to Christ the
[1:46:52] message was not to bring us to the
[1:46:54] Prophet the Prophet was a sign pointing
[1:46:56] us to Jesus Christ and how desperate are
[1:47:04] we to live this before our time runs out
[1:47:07] because make no mistake about it time is
[1:47:11] running out can the church say Amen
[1:47:20] I'll take my time this morning I wanted
[1:47:24] to get home but if I'm said in a message
[1:47:31] is your life will be to reject the day
[1:47:34] of visitation when God is making a visit
[1:47:36] to the church and to the people receive
[1:47:38] it then don't put it off till next year

[1:49:00] but that time Moses was walking through
[1:49:03] Egypt to say let my people go
[1:49:07] Moses didn't come just to bring plagues
[1:49:10] and yesterday liberation of Israel it
[1:49:13] was to put an end to the king of Egypt

[1:50:07] system is run by the god of this evil
[1:50:10] age Moses couldn't do it Elijah couldn't
[1:50:15] do it Jesus didn't want to do it because

[1:57:03] of the chaos in the midst of the
[1:57:04] darkness God said let there be light and
[1:57:07] there was light and time started to tick
[1:57:10] because God had a plan to reveal certain
[1:57:13] things from himself he longed to share
[1:57:16] certain things and when he tried with
[1:57:18] the Angels they couldn't appreciate it
[1:57:20] because they couldn't sing amazing grace
[1:57:22] he always had in his heart to hear the
[1:57:25] song amazing grace what that song but
[1:57:28] not Vince all on it that song could not
[1:57:34] have been saying in eternity at that
[1:57:37] time if we could place a sliver of time
[1:57:40] in eternity at that time but it kindly
[1:57:43] nobody's gonna sing amazing grace but
[1:57:46] this time when time friends in the
[1:57:48] Eternity and we take our position we can
[1:57:52] walk with Jesus and we can walk with
[1:57:54] Moses and we can sing amazing grace up
[1:57:57] in eternity because we know what it is
[1:58:00] [Applause]
[1:58:07] you may be seated no one the Bible was
[1:58:13] saying they'll sing a new song a new
[1:58:17] song the Angels could only sing a
[1:58:19] certain kind of song but this regime
[1:58:21] group of people who tasted time and
[1:58:24] returned back to God they would sing a
[1:58:26] new song they were singing of the
[1:58:28] goodness of Jesus they were singer of
[1:58:31] who hours long but I was now older I've
[1:58:34] never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:58:37] think back to that time you may be
[1:58:45] seated
[1:58:48] [Applause]
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:58:57] everybody with me everybody's feeling
[1:59:00] fine
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:01] [Applause]
[1:59:06] we have energy for another five hours
[1:59:09] [Applause]
[1:59:17] let me give you an illustration in a
[1:59:20] marathon a marathon runner I'm not
[1:59:25] speaking here by experience
[1:59:28] speaking my study hosta practice and
[1:59:34] train together a certain rhythm that
[1:59:37] momentum and typically what happens is
[1:59:40] this marathon runner gets into a rhythm
[1:59:43] in the race
[1:59:45] some say the average about ten or so
[1:59:47] kilometers of mass power and it gets
[1:59:49] into this rhythm because it's a longest
[1:59:52] and sometimes 20 miles or whatever it is
[1:59:54] you can be speeding up in the middle of
[1:59:57] this long distance but but no matter how
[2:00:03] long you have been running in a marathon
[2:00:05] when you see the finish line
[2:00:11] come into view something happens
[2:00:16] from somewhere deep with him no matter
[2:00:20] how long you were running and not matter
[2:00:22] the rhythm of the piece all of a sudden
[2:00:25] the sight of the finish line allows you
[2:00:28] to train another gear that you didn't
[2:00:32] want to use before because if we use
[2:00:34] that gear too soon you will run out the
[2:00:36] energy before you reach the finish line
[2:00:39] so a good marathon runner knows to
[2:00:42] conserve that top Oh Oh help me to hold
[2:00:46] back that until the finish line is in
[2:00:51] the view and when you need it because he
[2:00:55] said the third one will be there when
[2:00:57] you need it when the finish line is
[2:00:59] there then the oh god help me
[2:01:02] there's a pro to the line where you
[2:01:04] don't worry about who's next to you you
[2:01:06] don't worry about who's that insider you
[2:01:08] you don't worry about how long the
[2:01:10] journey was you don't think back up
[2:01:13] where even started you just want to make
[2:01:16] it over
[2:01:17] [Applause]
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:26] you may be seated and the sight of the
[2:01:32] finish line brings a level of energy and
[2:01:36] an acceleration of ripening salivation
[2:01:39] of speed
[2:01:40] can we type within the message and when
[2:01:44] you push over there something you don't
[2:01:46] even know who else was around you
[2:01:47] because yeah I was in the finish line
[2:01:49] but even if you're first second or Tilda
[2:01:52] this race is not for the Swift it's for
[2:01:54] those who could cross over
[2:01:56] no wonder the Prophet says when you make
[2:01:59] it there and you finally lift your head
[2:02:01] up you'll be surprised at who else made
[2:02:03] it you'd be surprised
[2:02:06] who has a turtle brought over the finish
[2:02:09] line when your strength is done the
[2:02:12] turtle comes to make sure that you can
[2:02:14] run all the way somebody give out a
[2:02:17] shout of praise
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:38] everybody feelin fine - time is running
[2:02:44] out
[2:02:46] time is running out on the economy time
[2:02:52] is running out on the education system
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:02:59] time is running out on the medical
[2:03:01] system because but the random told us to
[2:03:06] get in before the terrible horrible
[2:03:10] plague strike the judgement please now
[2:03:16] the doctors don't know nothing about men
[2:03:19] rotting in their flesh and all the
[2:03:22] terrible judgment is that we're a
[2:03:24] balancer will come from watching TV and
[2:03:27] from women who cut their hair and the
[2:03:30] judgment will come because of that
[2:03:32] that's what we are preparing for that's
[2:03:36] what the world is preparing for friends
[2:03:39] only the bride that elect lady makes the
[2:03:42] rapture there will be many in the
[2:03:46] message who don't make the rapture and
[2:03:49] they have a three and a half year still
[2:03:52] within time tribulation period and in
[2:03:56] that time cannot buy or sell unless they
[2:04:00] take the mark
[2:04:03] there's a mark that identifies that they
[2:04:05] are part of the system that they are
[2:04:09] part of this economy that's run by the
[2:04:12] devil that the systems and the laws and
[2:04:14] the legislation are already moving into
[2:04:17] that gear and people still want to come
[2:04:20] to church as if it's an ordinary of fear
[2:04:23] when whether Brown said the bride will
[2:04:26] be a hunted persecuted hunted persecuted
[2:04:33] group if I can handle that no easy time

[2:14:37] you may be seated
[2:14:39] could we talk some more can we
[2:14:41] fellowship some more just have a few
[2:14:47] examples just how the Prophet would do
[2:14:49] it just take a few examples God was so
[2:14:54] sick of the sin in Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:14:58] that he hit the clock himself poop
[2:15:00] inside the cone known to destroy that
[2:15:05] abomination that was Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:15:07] God is no respecter of person so the sin
[2:15:10] the stench of it disturbed him he
[2:15:13] couldn't leave it the way it was he had
[2:15:15] to do something about it the same way
[2:15:17] like in the days of Noah God repented he
[2:15:20] made man because they're very thinking
[2:15:23] he said was evil continually
[2:15:25] except for this man called Noah who
[2:15:27] found favor grace in the eyes of God so
[2:15:30] God came down and hit the stop watch on
[2:15:33] Sodom they didn't know that they were
[2:15:36] going to come 10 end but judgment was
[2:15:39] already on the earth judgment was
[2:15:42] already walked into them and they didn't
[2:15:43] know it I think of people sometimes who
[2:15:47] leave their homes and they never make it
[2:15:49] back home they did not know that day was
[2:15:53] their deed he left that do you think it
[2:15:55] would be like any other day but did I
[2:15:57] run out
[2:16:03] normal living going about their business
[2:16:06] as it was in the taste of Noah's it
[2:16:08] wasn't it is a lot people not realizing
[2:16:11] that their number has been called
[2:16:13] they're studying they're in school
[2:16:16] they're teaching their work and they're
[2:16:18] traveling they're driving worried about
[2:16:20] this worried about that worried about
[2:16:22] the other worried about the ambitions
[2:16:24] their careers how people see them their
[2:16:26] status worried about how people see them
[2:16:29] and their families how people see them
[2:16:31] in their neighborhoods have people seen
[2:16:32] them in the church and they miss that
[2:16:35] time has run out and it's a knocking for
[2:16:43] answer they are called to answer they
[2:16:47] are called to give an account and God
[2:16:52] comes down to Abraham's Abram you are my
[2:16:57] man only it
[2:17:00] and because man has dominion over the
[2:17:02] years this is our jurisdiction I will
[2:17:05] let you know what's about to happen once
[2:17:07] there's a Sun in place on the earth God
[2:17:09] speaks to that Sun I will let you know
[2:17:12] what's about to happen just like when
[2:17:15] the Prophet was here and a young girl
[2:17:17] was about to die and God could have
[2:17:19] stopped her if he wanted to he is
[2:17:20] sovereign he's omnipotent but there's a
[2:17:23] manatee it who isn't pleased who's in
[2:17:25] position she said brother Branham if you
[2:17:29] pray if you pray I need to be activated
[2:17:34] by your prayers I have the power but I
[2:17:38] need somebody to make a request how to
[2:17:42] check have the account but somebody got
[2:17:44] a sign and I put here for a purpose if
[2:17:47] you pray she could get the help that she
[2:17:53] needs
[2:17:56] and go out come to have a conversation
[2:17:58] without with with Abraham around letting
[2:18:01] you know I've come down to judge and
[2:18:04] Abraham has a true son Abraham you maybe
[2:18:07] see the cattle be like I see that
[2:18:08] worthless lot I tell em you know
[2:18:14] tell him who elephant stupidness he is
[2:18:16] not listening and you know what I'm born
[2:18:21] he's born that to hear him dance already
[2:18:26] you make your bed you align it
[2:18:31] and that's awesome officer
[2:18:35] lost the burden lost the love we forget
[2:18:37] how God delivered us and we quick to
[2:18:40] judge other people
[2:18:41] [Music]
[2:18:45] some of us so selfish we don't even
[2:18:47] testify and somebody testify to you
[2:18:51] Abraham had a choice we always have a
[2:18:53] choice
[2:18:54] god never takes away the ability to
[2:18:57] choose from us because it's part of what
[2:19:00] makes us who we are
[2:19:02] anyone say but lord if there be 50
[2:19:05] because I have family there
[2:19:08] this wasn't even this wasn't even
[2:19:10] Abraham's son honor this is a an area
[2:19:15] relative fitness as some of us can see

[2:20:52] wrong with you that's not what I'm
[2:20:53] talking about
[2:20:54] then what out of love out of abuddin out
[2:20:57] of caring or to be insensitive to what
[2:21:00] somebody else is going true you catch a
[2:21:02] button to pray for somebody because you
[2:21:06] want them to make it you know what your
[2:21:11] family alone you want as many as
[2:21:14] possible to make it and the church say
[2:21:17] man
[2:21:18] [Applause]
[2:21:23] is this helping anybody this morning so
[2:21:27] Sodom ran out of time and they didn't
[2:21:31] even know it
[2:21:32] this issue of time running out I'm not
[2:21:38] gonna be too much longer with you the
[2:21:41] man of the Pool of Bethesda for 38 years
[2:21:43] he had been coming there looking for
[2:21:46] change at a certain season abhava said
[2:21:50] the angel would stir the waters and
[2:21:52] whoever jump in first would get a
[2:21:54] healing you know that my about this
[2:21:56] brother he didn't even have a chance to
[2:21:59] get into the pool because when Jesus
[2:22:02] interviewed him he said I have no man to
[2:22:04] put me in so even if he wanted to go in
[2:22:08] he couldn't go in himself but he didn't
[2:22:09] stop coming but the time for his
[2:22:13] sickness and his disease have come to an
[2:22:15] end when Jesus stepped in there that day
[2:22:20] his hits but ten years had reached to
[2:22:23] heaven and Jesus couldn't come for
[2:22:26] everybody him to read to him will Darby
[2:22:28] meet him and the time for his suffering
[2:22:33] no no and he was delivered come the
[2:22:39] church Samer
[2:22:41] running out of time can you take some oh
[2:22:48] Jesus tired so tired the Bible said they
[2:22:52] had to carry him to the boat that
[2:22:55] character the board was not Jesus let's
[2:22:57] go quick carry me three both know the
[2:22:59] word carry in your original translation
[2:23:01] literally meant to lift I want you to
[2:23:03] picture this sight Almighty God and
[2:23:06] flesh so tired they had to lift him into
[2:23:09] the boat that he was sleeping so tired I
[2:23:13] when the storm came he was still
[2:23:15] sleeping some of us the moment we hear a
[2:23:18] snap we wake up storm coming dude ever
[2:23:20] saw something out of the ordinary but
[2:23:24] the devil didn't understand that there
[2:23:26] was a man on the other side time had run
[2:23:28] out for the demon that were chaining him
[2:23:31] time had run out for that spirit of war
[2:23:36] upon him and when they made it to the
[2:23:37] other side you know the story Jesus
[2:23:40] stepped on the shore on t minus minutes
[2:23:44] Jesus walked to that man and cast those
[2:23:47] Devils out and that man was never the
[2:23:51] same again because his time had come
[2:23:54] the PABA said he got in his right mind
[2:23:57] he was so convinced that he wanted to
[2:24:00] follow Jesus you said no don't follow me
[2:24:01] go testify go tell somebody what
[2:24:05] happened to you because they will
[2:24:07] believe your report because they knew
[2:24:09] how messed up you were but your time of
[2:24:11] deliverance has come and through your
[2:24:13] life god knows what will unveil because
[2:24:16] he knew it has to be good to take you
[2:24:18] out of that situation go preach the
[2:24:20] gospel or tell somebody time
[2:24:31] I'm not gonna be too much longer this
[2:24:33] morning but the Branham said now
[2:24:36] remember one word from him will mean
[2:24:38] more than I could speak in our hundred
[2:24:40] lives and I pray this morning one word
[2:24:43] from God will touch your heart and a
[2:24:45] reel permanently and you could see that
[2:24:48] there's no more time to play Church
[2:24:49] there's no more time to play games is
[2:24:52] only time for you to get to Holy Ghost
[2:24:54] there's only time for you to repent
[2:24:57] there's only time for the make things
[2:24:58] right there's only time to come to the
[2:25:00] altar to see a Lord I don't want to go
[2:25:02] home the seamer that I came in the
[2:25:05] message expectation but if I said friend
[2:25:07] without the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:25:08] I'm afraid we haven't got very much time
[2:25:10] left
[2:25:11] I'm afraid of always near won't you come
[2:25:13] now and be save and receive the baptism
[2:25:15] of the Holy Ghost won't you do it right
[2:25:17] now this afternoon while we have plenty
[2:25:20] of time can the church say
[2:25:25] in the message the future home of the
[2:25:29] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[2:25:31] bride
[2:25:32] but the Branham said now in Ephesians
[2:25:35] 1:10 and it's just a leader context in
[2:25:37] there it's called now if you're putting
[2:25:39] it down Ephesians 1:10 is call not a
[2:25:41] dispensation not the 7-day it's called
[2:25:43] the fullness of time when the fullness
[2:25:46] of time has come that's when time has
[2:25:48] been fulfilled so time itself is on a
[2:25:51] mission time itself has a limit time
[2:25:54] cannot go beyond what has been allocated
[2:25:57] for it because God already knows the
[2:25:59] exact point that time will blend into
[2:26:01] eternity in fact the Bible says here to
[2:26:04] cut the work short let's not be saved so
[2:26:06] he is watching time very closely to make
[2:26:11] sure that some individuals make it and
[2:26:15] he's prepared to cut the work short to
[2:26:17] ensure that you get the Holy Ghost
[2:26:18] that's the definition for the pride of
[2:26:21] making it now
[2:26:22] holy goes all the way to adoption can
[2:26:26] the church save another Pentecost still
[2:26:28] no messages we have an expectation go
[2:26:30] let's leave for us and when the fullness
[2:26:34] of time has come and that's when time
[2:26:36] has been fulfilled when there's normal
[2:26:38] time then you go into eternity after the
[2:26:42] seven church it is over and it is but a
[2:26:44] plan I'm already taught what it is
[2:26:46] finish the blending has already started
[2:26:50] that's why when God drops the anointing
[2:26:52] in here eternity dropping down to give
[2:26:55] you a taste of what you will experience
[2:26:57] that's why every day that come in by the
[2:26:59] Bremen said as we near the head storm it
[2:27:02] should be a super Church a super race as
[2:27:04] we near the head storm because we are
[2:27:06] planning into eternity where does that
[2:27:08] put your career what does it put your
[2:27:11] job where does that put your fussing on
[2:27:13] you're stewing and your arguments and
[2:27:15] your debates when he turned them to you
[2:27:17] suppose that Haman time is finished
[2:27:21] and the church seemed and Luther's
[2:27:27] idiots over as a prophet Methodist ages
[2:27:29] / Pentecostal ages over and now you go
[2:27:32] into what eternity
[2:27:34] no more sevens no more threes no more
[2:27:37] other very eternity where there's no
[2:27:39] such time as numbers and things and
[2:27:42] times you see it now can the church say
[2:27:45] Amen everybody with me
[2:27:49] now after time has been fulfilled listen
[2:27:53] carefully all sin is gone
[2:27:55] so as time runs out it means sin also
[2:27:59] runs out somebody preached back to me
[2:28:03] when time runs out sin is finished all
[2:28:09] sin is gone taken away at the Millennium
[2:28:13] at the great white throne judgment a
[2:28:15] type by Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost
[2:28:18] after the world is on fire and baptized
[2:28:20] its baptism of holy fire from heaven all
[2:28:24] sinners Gordon listen to the prophet or
[2:28:26] germs is gone all Devils is gone all
[2:28:30] temptations is gone all evil is gone
[2:28:34] then what does God do he can sit upon
[2:28:36] the earth see because all sin is gone so
[2:28:40] only when all sin is gone could cause
[2:28:43] sit upon the earth everybody with me
[2:28:45] this morning
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:28:50] we not eatin cereal this morning we
[2:28:54] choppin some meteor this morning we cut

[2:29:00] morning because we know what we are
[2:29:01] called to do we understand where we're
[2:29:04] going with understanding our
[2:29:05] expectations so that's the same now so
[2:29:08] better bound finish explain what's
[2:29:09] happening with the earth now God wants
[2:29:11] to have preeminence he wants a sit on
[2:29:13] the earth but he can't sit because the
[2:29:16] earth is not holy he is a holy God
[2:29:19] he has sit on a holy throne he was
[2:29:21] suspended with the holy people so
[2:29:23] something has happened to transform is
[2:29:25] not against the holy it that His Majesty
[2:29:28] his glory can sit comfortably so before
[2:29:30] he can sit sin must be finished
[2:29:33] sickness must be finished germs must be
[2:29:36] finished disease must be finished lying
[2:29:39] must we finish fornication must be
[2:29:41] finished adultery must be finished
[2:29:43] political systems finish economic

[2:30:12] are getting back to that somebody in
[2:30:15] wanna shout of praise

[2:30:17] [Music]
[2:30:18] [Applause]
[2:30:21] dear you are so Lea sons you are sons
[2:30:25] who are soldiers angels are also serving
[2:30:28] soldiers but you are some soldiers you

[2:30:45] here it's my team man come on somebody
[2:30:48] happy this morning
[2:30:49] no wonder the Devils are afraid of you
[2:30:52] because you are not angels angels and
[2:30:55] servants and angels have power but you
[2:30:57] here understood this is our - minion
[2:30:59] this is our jurisdiction hallelujah you
[2:31:06] may be seated
[2:31:08] that's why the spiritual realm they
[2:31:11] recognize who you they don't understand
[2:31:14] who we are
[2:31:14] but once you get into position they know
[2:31:16] you they know you so when the sons of
[2:31:20] sceva trying to do change they say who
[2:31:22] Paul I know pizza we know about it who

[2:31:32] here reputation temporal is different we
[2:31:36] respect those guys we listen to the
[2:31:39] scouts when they tell us move remove
[2:31:41] because they have influence on the earth
[2:31:43] in the spiritual realm the spiritual
[2:31:46] things of God and that's what we are
[2:31:49] striving for because both brothers were
[2:31:51] placed in their season and time and we
[2:31:53] have strived to be placed in our season
[2:31:55] before the tournament break strike
[2:31:57] because when they strike it will take
[2:32:00] tons of God to instruct those Devils get
[2:32:03] out of that house
[2:32:04] pants a demon get out of my wife get out
[2:32:07] of my children get out of my family son
[2:32:12] soldiers just like their father behave
[2:32:18] like their father talk like their father

[2:32:29] want an anointed I'm anointed my energy
[2:32:32] book I finished strong when I started
[2:32:34] [Applause]
[2:32:39] but ask me after that go to 6 p.m. today
[2:32:45] how could you become here blending from
[2:32:48] time is eternity only gonna wait to the
[2:32:51] difference like oh isn't it tasted it
[2:32:53] feels good enough because of eternity
[2:32:55] there's no my tiredness because someone
[2:32:57] is too much in time you feeling tired
[2:32:59] but come on a tyrant is eternity where
[2:33:02] time is no more joy unspeakable no more
[2:33:06] it's crying no more pills no more
[2:33:07] mortgage no more traffic you move by a
[2:33:10] thought where you need to be your finger
[2:33:15] than your there pickle taxi so eternity
[2:33:18] is like listen you ever stood where the
[2:33:21] random wife said to him when you got
[2:33:23] think until you see your preacher about
[2:33:25] it but you don't even know what it is so
[2:33:27] even the Prophet with all of his
[2:33:29] revelation didn't even catch some
[2:33:31] magnitude of what eternity is like oh
[2:33:34] god help us your prints are powders we
[2:33:37] have no idea how good it is and we are
[2:33:40] blending some time into eternity
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:43] [Applause]
[2:33:48] you may be seated when Jesus was here he
[2:33:56] was in a physical body living in time
[2:33:59] but it was eternity trapped in time
[2:34:04] because quad is eternal he was using a
[2:34:09] body but it was eternity call him South
[2:34:12] shaft in a time body but it was eternity
[2:34:14] nonetheless somebody help me this
[2:34:16] morning and God once again it's about to
[2:34:19] step into individuals who will be
[2:34:21] eternity trapped in time because that's
[2:34:27] how the rapture can take place because
[2:34:28] only eternity could be in the rapture or
[2:34:31] glory help us that's why it'll be on the
[2:34:33] inside coming out eternity has to be in
[2:34:38] you
[2:34:39] [Applause]
[2:34:39] [Music]
[2:34:42] [Applause]
[2:34:43] and the church hymn in the ministry of
[2:34:46] the fivefold ministry will be the impact
[2:34:49] eternal life that's the greatest gift
[2:34:51] that even ever get because eternal life
[2:34:54] means you are truly connected to who you
[2:34:57] were in the thoughts of God never had a
[2:35:00] beginning
[2:35:01] never has been ending you are creature
[2:35:04] from eternity
[2:35:05] just like Jesus you come into time to
[2:35:08] prove to the devil that there could be
[2:35:10] more like him come onto the earth and
[2:35:13] take the test of time the test of time
[2:35:16] because time itself is a test you may be
[2:35:20] seated
[2:35:21] Oh hallelujah this helps somebody to
[2:35:26] break free now you can understand why
[2:35:30] true worship comes not from the things
[2:35:33] of this temporal claim but it comes from
[2:35:36] your eternal destiny an eternal calling
[2:35:40] an eternal position and no one the poor
[2:35:43] can see death where is your sting grave
[2:35:45] where is your victory because it opened
[2:35:48] up to him that even though he was born
[2:35:50] in that time he was really come from
[2:35:52] eternity and that awareness made him
[2:35:57] realize that if I drop this physical
[2:36:00] body that's not the end of me if I drop
[2:36:03] this physical body that's not who I am
[2:36:06] I'm inside his house God chose this
[2:36:09] house as a temporary holding place as a
[2:36:12] temporary house
[2:36:16] [Applause]
[2:36:19] you may be seated
[2:36:22] but with sin and time came the senses of
[2:36:26] the mind imagination in reasoning
[2:36:29] conscience affection these emotions and
[2:36:32] the devil's playground was allow in your
[2:36:34] mind to try to distract you with the
[2:36:36] education and the politics and the news
[2:36:38] and the dissonant that and everything
[2:36:40] will come to church it's a reminder of
[2:36:42] your eternal call your eternal
[2:36:45] destination and the fact that you are
[2:36:47] here to restore the balance as it were
[2:36:50] because Satan in heaven
[2:36:53] but we were represented there and we
[2:36:56] kicked him out there and because we were
[2:36:58] represented they were hooking them or
[2:36:59] their God dispatch us here to finish the
[2:37:02] work that was kicked out in heaven we
[2:37:04] take the same agents that were
[2:37:06] represented by angelic beings in heaven
[2:37:08] Oh somebody help me this mornin who had
[2:37:10] experience fightin with Michael their
[2:37:15] build experience fightin with Michael to
[2:37:18] take the dragon out you may be seated
[2:37:21] [Applause]
[2:37:27] you may be seated
[2:37:29] but because the devil fell from that
[2:37:32] existence he cannot recall the agents
[2:37:35] who fought with Michael he cannot
[2:37:39] identify them and he has been on the
[2:37:41] lookout ever since because he
[2:37:43] understands the realm of this world and
[2:37:45] he understand the realm of the natural
[2:37:47] so when Jesus was here if thou be the
[2:37:49] Son of God a commission of inquiry
[2:37:51] started the final if this was one of
[2:37:54] them who had kicked him out in heaven
[2:37:56] and Jesus never gave him the privilege
[2:38:00] Jesus this was not obligated to answer
[2:38:03] he just took Scripture and responded
[2:38:08] with Scripture because our Authority we
[2:38:11] don't answer to Devils we command Devils
[2:38:15] we don't order devil an answer
[2:38:18] we command him you may be seated
[2:38:28] [Applause]
[2:38:29] you may be seated
[2:38:33] [Applause]
[2:38:37] [Music]
[2:38:41] you'd be seated this plan was so
[2:38:45] articulate this plan was what defined
[2:38:48] that you know when the US Army that was
[2:38:51] a step into an area the center
[2:38:53] reconnaissance team an investigative
[2:38:56] team the land usually is the Marines
[2:39:00] would go first to mix one set up because
[2:39:03] the ships have to come by just pull up
[2:39:05] on the shore
[2:39:06] yes so they got to secure the area so
[2:39:09] Jesus said the Spirit of the Lord is
[2:39:10] upon me for he has anointed me to preach
[2:39:13] the gospel to open the eyes of the
[2:39:15] brighter comfort to that morning and he
[2:39:17] stopped just before the acceptable year
[2:39:20] of the Lord because he was the first
[2:39:23] part of the mission the acceptable year
[2:39:26] of the Lord was the roar army the whole
[2:39:29] pride the people who were called by his
[2:39:32] name he would multiply himself in when
[2:39:35] they arrived it will not the ending of
[2:39:38] time
[2:39:39] [Applause]
[2:39:42] [Music]
[2:39:44] [Applause]
[2:39:47] [Music]
[2:39:48] [Applause]
[2:39:53] you may be seated
[2:39:55] I like this being said this morning
[2:39:57] gonna have to listen to the tape again
[2:39:58] and rejoice because I'm identifying my
[2:40:01] scripture and by the prophets message
[2:40:03] who you are and why you kind of live in
[2:40:05] a tunnel around you kind of live in the
[2:40:07] realm of sinning and sharpeners and
[2:40:09] gossip and backbiting you are more than
[2:40:11] that you're bigger than that
[2:40:13] you know cause for that kind of nonsense
[2:40:15] you are sons you are tortoise you are
[2:40:17] kings you are priests you are you may be
[2:40:27] seated
[2:40:28] [Applause]
[2:40:30] we preach this before my who we really
[2:40:36] need to know demons have no power unless
[2:40:41] they get people to work through angels
[2:40:48] have no power unless I get people to
[2:40:51] operate through that's why the Holy
[2:40:53] Ghost is looking for vessels just as the
[2:40:55] devil is looking for vessels there's a
[2:40:57] dimensional distinction that exists
[2:41:00] between the realm of heaven earth and
[2:41:01] underneath and we preach about an Easter
[2:41:04] last year I believe that God Almighty
[2:41:06] God wanted to intervene in the affairs
[2:41:09] of men so he sent representatives
[2:41:12] that's what Abraham was just what was
[2:41:14] was because the affect the affairs of
[2:41:16] men it has to be a kinsman it must be a
[2:41:19] man to affect the affairs of men because
[2:41:21] man was given Dominion jurisdiction
[2:41:24] power authority control over the earth
[2:41:27] the Angels too that have that God
[2:41:30] Himself controls the heaven and
[2:41:32] everything Sharon but he gives man this
[2:41:35] earth
[2:41:35] [Applause]
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:38] you may be seated
[2:41:40] sort of affected a fears of man when God
[2:41:43] was comfortable with the Ministry of
[2:41:45] every prophet of every judge of every
[2:41:48] leader he said this in another man but
[2:41:51] this man will not be like those men this
[2:41:53] man will not be like Joshua this man
[2:41:55] will not be like David this man will not
[2:41:56] make a mistake this man will not sin
[2:41:59] this man will not be born through sin is
[2:42:01] gonna be born through sex this man has
[2:42:03] to be a brother to my children he must
[2:42:06] be a father to my children he must be a
[2:42:08] king to my people
[2:42:12] you may be seated
[2:42:13] and to intervene in the affairs of Man
[2:42:18] God had to end morphe himself change
[2:42:21] himself transform himself in the realms
[2:42:25] of heaven you walked into the secret
[2:42:27] chamber and when he changed himself he
[2:42:29] found himself in the womb of Mary to go
[2:42:35] to the process because Adam had like
[2:42:37] master process but this brother to us
[2:42:40] this kinsman to us but not bypass the
[2:42:43] process you may be seated
[2:42:48] anybody sleeping everybody with me this
[2:42:51] morning you've ever seen it ah it's one
[2:42:54] the devil didn't know he was there I did
[2:42:57] too the devil didn't know he was there
[2:42:59] and it's ten the devil didn't know he
[2:43:01] was there so secretive was this mission
[2:43:06] so perfect was this plan so ordained was
[2:43:10] this operation that when Jesus finally
[2:43:13] stepped out
[2:43:18] it was so subtle you may be seated
[2:43:21] that John the Baptist whose primary
[2:43:24] purpose was to identify this Messiah had
[2:43:27] to ask himself are you the one what
[2:43:30] should we look for another so secretive
[2:43:37] was this intervention that Jesus still
[2:43:40] didn't answer him he said tell John that
[2:43:44] the sick are healed tell John that the
[2:43:48] blind eyes are open tell John he will
[2:43:51] know what I mean that the lame are
[2:43:53] walking tell John that the Thomas
[2:43:56] weakened John will know what that means
[2:43:58] he will know that the greater than
[2:44:00] Solomon is here he will know that
[2:44:02] Messiah is on the earth even though that
[2:44:05] the one who will baptize with fire has
[2:44:07] come down
[2:44:08] [Applause]
[2:44:09] [Music]
[2:44:11] [Applause]
[2:44:21] you may be seated and all the while this
[2:44:26] is going on from since Genesis to this
[2:44:28] time the devil is thinking he has one he
[2:44:31] has the upper hand
[2:44:33] but God's great clock is counting down
[2:44:36] God's great clock is just ticking it's
[2:44:40] just ticking it's just ticking just
[2:44:42] ticking and even when Jesus was here we
[2:44:45] preached this before he had yet another
[2:44:48] mystery another ministry because Adam
[2:44:51] was not supposed to die and I was not
[2:44:53] supposed to get sick Adam as a creature
[2:44:55] of eternity place here on this earth was
[2:44:57] never sick never we'd never tired never
[2:44:59] depressed God Himself had to fix that
[2:45:07] situation but he couldn't go in a forum
[2:45:09] he wasn't heaven he couldn't go as Jesus
[2:45:12] the only entry into the lower realms was
[2:45:16] true death
[2:45:19] [Music]
[2:45:22] so in Jesus in Matthew 16 when he was
[2:45:26] having this great conversation it was
[2:45:28] the first time he was revealing with
[2:45:30] clarity with distinction without
[2:45:33] hesitation with a loofa interpretation
[2:45:35] who he was
[2:45:37] he started with a question who do men
[2:45:39] say I am because he wants to reveal
[2:45:41] something to them but he wants to settle
[2:45:43] their questions you want to make sure he
[2:45:45] knew where they were he said who do men
[2:45:47] say I am and his brothers pulled out in
[2:45:50] notepads some cui lies because we know
[2:45:53] you're anointed see you are like
[2:45:54] Jeremiah some and they had all the good
[2:45:57] things to say you may be seated and then
[2:46:02] Jesus checked him he said I'm a Mac your
[2:46:04] papers no it's easy to give somebody
[2:46:06] else testimony but who do you say you've
[2:46:08] been with me all along you've been in
[2:46:10] the message all along you've been here
[2:46:12] and you've been seeing you've been
[2:46:13] tasting you've been experiencing but who
[2:46:15] do you say I am and those brothers
[2:46:18] couldn't move and then Peter said throw
[2:46:21] out the Christ the Son of the Living God
[2:46:23] and Jesus still to him until you didn't
[2:46:26] figure that out young man you didn't
[2:46:28] figure that out flesh and blood
[2:46:30] nobody told it is but my father in
[2:46:32] heaven give you a revelation and upon
[2:46:35] that rock of Revelation that's what I
[2:46:38] build my church on I call you by
[2:46:41] revelation
[2:46:42] I call your name by revelation you may
[2:46:49] be seated
[2:46:51] could you take someone
[2:46:55] everybody feeling fine the Deacons have
[2:46:59] things under control John says anybody
[2:47:01] sleeping if you're sleeping let me know

[2:47:42] and when Jesus died the last part of his
[2:47:46] mission because time is running out
[2:47:52] Jesus transformed himself to be able to
[2:47:55] enter into Satan's headquarters all the
[2:48:01] devils who were sent up to investigate
[2:48:03] who this Jesus was a return back to base
[2:48:06] because the problem seemingly had been
[2:48:09] eliminated Jesus was dead but about said
[2:48:13] the bride the message with her like it's
[2:48:15] washed up the mess it will look like
[2:48:17] it's finished the mess will look all
[2:48:19] messed up but brother Branham said that
[2:48:20] and it is within that time God is really
[2:48:24] performing a work that was hidden under
[2:48:26] the Seventh Seal because it never cannot
[2:48:29] know what it is
[2:48:30] but the random taught us well you may be
[2:48:32] said that elekid him push did anything
[2:48:34] but I see the seventh seal he doesn't
[2:48:36] even know what it is
[2:48:37] he cannot figure it out this is beyond
[2:48:40] his education level is intellectual
[2:48:43] gymnastics he does not know what's under
[2:48:45] there
[2:48:45] the seventh seal himself I drop down and
[2:48:49] knock on the door and when he entered
[2:48:55] there by the pop well those brothers you
[2:48:58] see what that looks like the wheel in
[2:48:59] the middle of the wheel that's what the
[2:49:01] Prophet said that looked like the rock
[2:49:03] beneath the rock that will look like the
[2:49:05] great Shepherd that looks like who kept
[2:49:08] me there and the devil took and Jesus
[2:49:13] rather took the keys of death and hell
[2:49:16] you know what it is may be seated
[2:49:18] to be in charge of a jail I need all the
[2:49:20] keys
[2:49:23] [Applause]

[2:49:30] self would to wake up every morning and
[2:49:33] go to work the minor prison are you even
[2:49:36] ready keys you walk around as you say
[2:49:40] scare people to keep them there at any
[2:49:45] point in time you could somebody could
[2:49:48] kick it open and you have no power to
[2:49:50] stop them you have no power and you know
[2:49:54] anything is when one person will free

[2:50:20] until today today today today house of
[2:50:24] hell give way to the name of Jesus
[2:50:26] that's why the Prophet said you can go
[2:50:28] free if you want to go free and who the
[2:50:31] Son of man set free is what is what give
[2:50:36] the lot of soda praise somebody give God
[2:50:44] a shout of praise I'm almost finished
[2:50:47] musicians get ready we're going to leave
[2:50:50] this place I'm still excited I'm here we
[2:50:53] are blending some time and eternity
[2:50:56] I believe you're catching a revelation
[2:50:58] of who we are where we come from where
[2:51:01] we are going
[2:51:02] [Applause]
[2:51:12] hallelujah my giving at all time
[2:51:15] religion give me that old-time religion
[2:51:18] give me that all time preaching
[2:51:22] hallelujah you may be seasoned Peter was
[2:51:27] so anointed but because listen time was
[2:51:31] not yet fulfilled he couldn't go to the
[2:51:34] rapture that's the power of time because
[2:51:41] to everything there's a timed every
[2:51:43] purpose at that time it's a season every
[2:51:45] time so nothing happened before its time
[2:51:47] we preached it before the people in the
[2:51:51] days of Wesley was so sanctified that
[2:51:57] the Holy Ghost wanted the port upon them
[2:52:00] because the sanctified life attracts the
[2:52:04] Holy Ghost
[2:52:06] so the Deacons were the Reimann and that
[2:52:08] they had a bucket of water right next to
[2:52:11] them and they were on the lookout so now
[2:52:13] whenever somebody got so anointed
[2:52:16] because I was jacked in the Holy Ghost
[2:52:18] their mission was a true water on them
[2:52:20] to calm them down because the season was
[2:52:24] not yet it will be a years afterwards in
[2:52:27] God's clock ticking down that when she
[2:52:30] mo would come and see the season has
[2:52:31] arrived
[2:52:32] I believe the seasons arrive and then
[2:52:35] the Holy Ghost poured out in the elusive
[2:52:37] Street revival because a seasonal change
[2:52:39] somebody please back to me he may be
[2:52:42] seated
[2:52:43] God is counting now he is taking now
[2:52:46] time is running out and all of a sudden
[2:52:49] God said I can't restore it all yet
[2:52:52] because I have to send a prophet
[2:52:55] because over the years they lost certain
[2:52:59] things but I want to send not pack power
[2:53:02] I want to send all the power all that
[2:53:06] God was he put up the Christ and all
[2:53:09] that Christ was he pours into the church
[2:53:11] but in order listen carefully forgot to
[2:53:14] pull all of the spirit all of the wood
[2:53:17] has to be restored because the word is
[2:53:21] the conductor of the Spirit now
[2:53:25] depending on how big the conductor is is
[2:53:28] how much power could go through that
[2:53:31] [Applause]
[2:53:32] conductor if the wire is this small only
[2:53:36] that much power to come through and over
[2:53:39] the years they had the wire or hoe
[2:53:42] because all the worries that restored so
[2:53:44] sudden when a power would come and they
[2:53:46] were having an anointing but it was not
[2:53:47] sustainable but when the prophet came it
[2:53:49] was a line upon line precept upon
[2:53:52] precept all the loose ends from Genesis
[2:53:56] to Revelation in the written word was
[2:53:58] now being tied up by the ministry of the
[2:54:01] revealed word because these son of man
[2:54:03] himself had stepped into his son of man
[2:54:06] so it was not brother Branham tying up
[2:54:09] the loose ends but it was Jesus Christ
[2:54:11] himself in another time the Lord himself
[2:54:15] had descended with a shot to allow his
[2:54:19] power he wasn't taking chances
[2:54:22] Holloman to do this somebody please back
[2:54:27] to me why you will receive him
[2:54:32] because through the Old Testament he had
[2:54:36] talked about I will be their God and
[2:54:38] they will be my people that was a
[2:54:41] different type of relationship this
[2:54:43] relationship was not people and God
[2:54:45] this was husband and wife thing this was
[2:54:52] man and wife thing so God is not dissing
[2:54:54] the court and people thicknesses
[2:54:55] relationship thing and I said I had
[2:54:58] taken chances with no man to man having
[2:55:00] my wife I am coming on myself I was
[2:55:03] slipping here and there the Whisperer
[2:55:05] loves secrets to her to let her know
[2:55:08] that I love her let's unknown shooter
[2:55:10] would have slipped something in there so
[2:55:12] when the Prophet come good evening
[2:55:14] friends it was caught himself slipping
[2:55:18] in secrets for his bride who only she
[2:55:22] could understand what he was saying
[2:55:24] people were sitting there in Indiana
[2:55:27] sitting there in Arizona sitting there
[2:55:30] in New York sitting there in California
[2:55:32] but he was speaking to one person his
[2:55:35] bride you must forget the one person his
[2:55:38] elect lady come to church hey man
[2:55:44] everybody feeling fine do you know who
[2:55:47] you are you may be seated
[2:55:51] in the meantime time is Compton now 65
[2:55:56] prophet leaves have seen and this is the
[2:55:59] age the season the time go to do with
[2:56:01] him for because when the Prophet left
[2:56:03] the angel did not leave the angel is
[2:56:07] here but Abraham said fixing things
[2:56:09] around for the coming of the Lord so the
[2:56:11] angel in 65 66 67 68 69 all these years
[2:56:15] moving things around shifting things
[2:56:18] around hunting down people some people
[2:56:21] were just to get you to know who you are
[2:56:23] dear one
[2:56:24] and part of who the bride was they were
[2:56:26] just there to carry the message the way
[2:56:28] the Prophet said it so that you would be
[2:56:29] here we were not here when the Prophet
[2:56:31] was here but thank God but those who he
[2:56:34] used to get to us because the marriage

[2:57:58] [Music]
[2:58:04] in a message lifting him out of history
[2:58:07] as you get ready to close out but the
[2:58:10] random said we are standing tonight upon
[2:58:12] the brim and watching come to pass and
[2:58:15] unfold to great seams and those two
[2:58:18] great scenes are these one of them is
[2:58:20] the ending of history and by the ending
[2:58:23] of history
[2:58:24] he means a closing of the pages of the
[2:58:26] written word what has been foretold and
[2:58:29] the other one is the ending of time and
[2:58:33] many great men through the ages has
[2:58:36] longed to see this hour and we are now
[2:58:38] approaching and as we live in this
[2:58:40] glorious setting of mortal Sun and the
[2:58:42] breaking of the eternal light I do feel
[2:58:45] that we're living in one of the grandest
[2:58:47] ages that ever man has been permitted to
[2:58:50] live because it's a closing out of time
[2:58:52] and the blending in of eternity history
[2:58:56] only tells us what we have read what has
[2:58:58] been and what's in the future is in the
