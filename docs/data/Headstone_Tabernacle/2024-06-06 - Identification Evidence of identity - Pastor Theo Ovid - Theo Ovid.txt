presence and power in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you it's good to be back and um if have your Bibles I like you to Luke chapter 24 we'll be in that one scripture read from 13 to 47 uh 13 to 27 then 44 to 45 and then 49 to 53 it's good to be here in the house of God tonight we're reading from verse 13 of Luke 24 we read and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emos which was about uh uh from Jerusalem about three score full arms and they talked together of all these things which had happened it came to pass that while they commune together and reason Jesus came himself Drew near and went with them and their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said to them what manner of communications are these that he have one to another as he walk on Assad and one of them whose name was Copus answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem Hast not known the things which are come to pass in these days he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which is a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people how the chief priest and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him and we trusted in it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yeah and certain woman also over company M astonished were at earlier the SE Falon and when they not they had found not his body they came saying they have seen visions of angels which said he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the SE Fula and found it even as the woman had said but him this one not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all the the prophets have spoken ought not Christ have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself reading from verse 44 and he said and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures we go down to verse 49 and he's speaking this promise to them now and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tiing the seity of Jerusalem until you be inw power from high and he led them as far as out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen let's pray once more father we have read your word and we thank you for your word your word is truth your word is light your word is life we are depending upon this oh God feed us tonight and bless your word and confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles and outpour your spirit upon the seed in the people's heart and upon their lives in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise God and I know uh you were blessed by the service on Sunday and and and I didn't get I haven't heard it but but God I know God has blessed you and and tonight amen and tonight I have a title um identification evidence of identity and I know about Isaac spoke about the mystery of a spiritual identity but I have something identification evidence of identity and I have an inspiration an identification identifying that this person has been redeemed that's inspiration an identification identifying that this person has been redeemed identification is the act of identifying or the state of being identified identification evidence of identity who are you not so much what you do but defining who you are your actual existence so sometime you ask who are you not what your job is not what your profession is but you could be identified by profession also and and other matters but we just speaking about the who are you part and who are you it speaks to your character it not speak to your position or office or what position you could be a president you could be a CEO you could be a boss you could be a principal you could be a doctor it doesn't matter what you do as a profession but who are you so we're not talking about your social identity professional Identity or whether your father mother relationship identity talking about who you are now your character is not your reputation reputation is what people think about you assume about you think that this is so in in in in words that identify a reputation it refers to the collective perception or estimation of an individual sometimes people reputation is do in harmony with their character people think they are that but not that they have a reputation to be that but when they Mark bus as we just say in local terms is a different thing altogether am so what we look at now as to who is not your reputation yeah you have some what you call white color Crooks white color criminals um but the the reputation is not that good the reputation is fine to society but the character is not right here okay now listen to this now if God go acted any one time on a certain circumstance and if that same circumstance rise again he's got to act the second time like he did the first time or he's unjust no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid you may be become he's got to act to you like he did that Fallen woman or he acted wrong there do you believe that and here it here it is now because he's got to act to you like he did that Fallen woman or he acted wrong God's behavior is his person I I think a revelation needed about that about God's Behavior it expresses the person of God not what you think not what you feel so he's saying God's Behavior to this woman caught in adultery God Behavior to this woman at the well is his person oh give the Lord some Praises I don't think you get that so he can't behave to one person and then when the same situation come he behaved differently God's Behavior has his person his behavior have to be consistent because he is God oh glory to God good could we give the Lord some Praises you [Applause] now the prophet we living in a days of identification that identification is required you can't unless you're known to the bank you can't cash a check unless you have something to identify yourself you can't fly you can't board a plane you have to have a passport you have to have something that identify who you are what country you're from if you're qualified if you have a visa to land into the country you're going into you have to have an identification and I believe to go to heaven you have to have an identification God have to see if you really belong inside of there so when the word come or whether God come or to say who are you you got to be able to say who you are or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah I belong here this is my land praise God when that plane hit and land in Trinidad and I step up that plane I know this is my land they can't tell me I don't belong they can't tell me get out of here this is my land this is where I am born praise I feel very confident I might be shaky in other countries but want to hit my country this is my home this is my land and when you hit Heaven this is your home this is your land that's how you have to feel you have to confident angel can say you don't belong here praise God one time we read about somebody talking about they didn't expect this one and this and expect that one they didn't expect that one and they they shocked I didn't expect you all the expect all the expect yeah but we didn't expect you to be here oh thank God we made it oh go it will be God's grace to all of us oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so you have to have identification Prophet our character molds us to the image of what we are our character of life that's in us and if you take that Little Gym of life life it'll produce a bird or wheat or a corn or whatever it is the life that's in it molds the character of it now this is deep tonight this is not Corn Flakes and milk all right then we find out like the life of a cancer a germ a cancer germ it molds a cancer it's an evil life that life of a tumor with mold a tumor you see our characters is molded by what's on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what on the inside No Excuses so when people act they act out or the spirit get called out or the spirit live out and try to explain it I mean no no no you have no explanation you acted out because something on the inside and whatever on the inside will come on the outside despite what your mou talking besid what your words are saying all right so our characters is molded by what on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what's on the inside what we are how we walk no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our word does we might say I'm a Believer in God well I would say well do you believe all the Bible I don't know well you see that's your lips your very life is speaking louder than what your words would be if you say I'm a Christian and you believe what God Said is the truth then live any kind of life after that your life speaks louder than what your testimony does one of the greatest hindrance what the Church of God has The Bootlegger The Gambler we all know what which way they are headed they know themselves but the fellow that professes to be a Christian the woman that profess to be a Christian then lives and something different is the greatest stumbling block that's the outside world has got and there there is in the outside world anywhere it's worse than anything the world can produce is a person that's supposed to be a Christian and then live some something different from that lying stealing cheating doing things that he ought not to do is a discredit or test testimony and when you take people and to do those things and they say our and that's why he say our character is molded in dear by the life that's in us now we would say Jesus came to save that which was lost that's what he did now there had to be something to save this lost it had to be a different character so watch how we approaching this right now a character have to save what was lost a different kind because when God diping dip from us now all have sin and come short to Glory he dip his sin he dip his sin he dip his sin he have coat jacket and tie and long dress but it's still sin oh praise the name of the Lord so he cannot go back inside that pot that is a sinful pot he had to come a virgin shall conceive he had to bring out something completely different to change his whole dimension oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God so when God looked upon his creation that he had made his characters on this Earth his loving character himself this is beautiful his loving character himself was molded into the person of Jesus Christ that's God's character Hallelujah to say save man that loving character in God to save man it was molded in the person of Jesus Christ for God so loved the world he molded This Man Called Jesus Christ and put that character to come and become a savior which was one of his attributes that was loosed inside of him that was locked up inside of him oh give the Lord some Praises so the attribute of Savior come by a molded character of his love which was Jesus Christ the word made flesh and that word going to be in your flesh with the same character being molded inside of you oh give the Lord has PR and that will be your identification Oh Glory that will be your identity oh give the Lord a shout and every devil in hell will see your ID card oh give the Lord some Praises every devil in hell will know where you come from when Paul was walking when Peter was walking them devil said Paul I'm Peter I know oh give the Lord a shout in the house they saw the card they could identify those Sons hallelujah hallelujah there was no other character anywhere could have produced such a person as Jesus Christ but God himself his own love projected Jesus Christ that was God manifesting himself not some other person but himself in body form to redeem that which was lost it take love to redeem oh that's fresh brother punch that is fresh tonight it take love to redeem not legalism it takes Love Oh Glory to God somehow we have to connect with Lov oh give the Lord some Praises brotherly kindness will fail but charity never fail it Oh Glory to God it's fresh tonight it takes Lov it takes love to redeem it takes love to go after a fallen brother it takes love to go after a fallen sister the one that cuts you up the one that hat you the one that don't like you it going to take love to do that and love is Promised one day we'll be standing talking and love will come into the building and all that's wrong will be taken out all the evil will be taken out that anointing will break the Yoke the church will be rebuilt by the power of the spirit loose from The Headstone not by might not by power but by my spirit oh it's good in here tonight we feel inspired tonight oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah we are inspired we not only feeling it we are inspired oh give the Lord some praises God came down the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible oh this is enough to close up right here this is enough to shout inside of here he was God made visible and the Word was invisible until it become flesh and when that same word that same God come into your flesh the invisible will be made visible oh give the Lord some praises the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible in the beginning was God was even God then what the object of worship but him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and the Word was manifest what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are part of God God didn't want you to remain a thought he wants you to be expressed and you can only be Express by the word Oh Glory to God you bypass the word Oh Glory to God you bypass your Tony oh give the Lord a shout tonight in order to be tested and tempted and here you are on this earth oh no devil could stop you from going back to where you come from you could be expressed because it was a thought to begin with oh give the Lord a shout make me feel like running right now oh glory to God not you're feeling it are you not what you're feeling it's what God said Oh Glory to God I told him in Miami what God say you are that is what you are I don't care how you feel but is what God say you are what God say you are that is what you are give the Lord a shout tell the devil is a liar tonight you're not going by your feeling you're not going by your flesh you're not going by your senses you're going by what God Said and God is not a man that would [Music] lie am I crazy I hope not I hope there a mad man preaching to you I sound like a mad man maybe see the praise God at that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you the whole thing is God becoming material not God become more argumentative man clinging sword and sword fighting like what God is Hall is God becoming material not man becoming more eloquent and you can't see God so you seeing eloquence how the words coming together but no God he call a word Smith God coming together to redeem a wife a bride that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world that was the attributes of God God being displayed and how to make a character that could redeem this woman it had to be something greater than her to redeem her you can't be in the water struggling for your life and trying to save somebody tell when you're paddling you can't you can't even save yourself and somebody come around you but you might drunk them because you you you struggling for life you both struggling and you think this person you could prop you prop pushing them deep in the hole in water so you have to come out of that you have to come into the place and you have to see yourself in that position mentally first a lot of people they they paralyzing the head they need a brain transplant a thinking transplant the Bible talk about the renewing of your mind if your mind don't change you Ain changing nothing because the word come to affect or infect your mind and your thoughts and that is the same thing the devil does infect your mind and thoughts to produce unbelief but once you see you your mind get infected with faith and the thoughts of God it changes your thinking but the Gideon s us a story of a young man who wasn't s in school and somebody say why don't you take the SAT test and he did it and out of, 1600 he get 1470 his mother tell him I sure you cheat cuz she know that capable of that he said cheat she said momy I didn't cheat and he's had to tell himself suppose I really bright boy Fleck the strong 10 years later he's very successful he went and Friends he he get better friends and and went to college and school and graduated and become very successful 10 years later the S people call him and tell him some people get errors the wrong result you really didn't get 1450 you get 740 now here what he said the guy said he said his life changed when he got that score of 14 something or when he begin to think that he got that score his mind changed and now based upon the score he thought he got success was just waiting for him to step on it now that they tell him you really get4 words he FL that is irrelevant because my mind already succeeded so you are what you think you are as a man think it in his heart so is he or so he is if you think you're going to fail you will fail if you think you're going to fall you're going to fall but what if you think you're overcoming what if you think you'll get Victory what if you think God will multiply and act to you and make a way for you and give you the wisdom and knowledge and understanding to manage the challenges that is yet before you oh give the Lord a shout stop complaining about the beer because the lion coming oh can the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and when the lion roar say that is nothing because you're waiting for golad oh give the Lord a shout that mean you're going to shout inside of here tonight if he's a redeemer he come to redeem or to pick up that which is fallen so he ain't come Saints he come for Sinners redeem is to redeem Fallen one when he bring you out now he expect you to remain a sinner what can I a Sint is that he become to become a saint right so he come to pick up that which was Fallen to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning so none here we go listen none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning none Hallelujah he come to redeem here we go not this Canon father that we see you know what Canon father is that is where the nuclear bombs are to go and lick up when Putin say any bums and thing he's not going bum desert it have to have Cannon F some to hit you Ain going bumit in the ocean nobody there like fish fish getting blows fish the nuclear the trees you know is man Wicked Man wickedness he come to redeem not this Canon father that we see professing to be Christians he's specific here but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the begin beginning so you see the stature is what you want to see what statue he talking about the Statue of Christ which was God projected to the Earth in the form of a man that's the stature you want to see as a young Christian believer when I came to this message I always believe any man that get the key to unlock that pyramid that is it amen as a young I was 17 and I always saw the key to this whole thing is how to unlock that because that that is locked you know remember that book was there's a book you know that was sealed with Seven Seals in know it's only three Bibles the physical Bible the Zodiac and that one the pyramid that was locked you know we see it now and say pyamid and Elijah and what not but that was sealed that wasn't always so you know a prophet take it and say seven ages seven Messengers seven voices seven spirits oh give the Lord a shout seven rainbow we accustomed with that like it's normal but it's not normal you know that's a hidden Mystery you know that was revealed in end time it took the last the prophet to look back and say Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley oh give the Lord some Praises it took a prophet to take the rainbow and fit it inside of there a Prophet did that and tell us the secret lays in the pyramid Oh Glory to God and Enoch built the Pyramid and was not for God took him oh glory to God and the Capstone coming to cap the bride does the Thunders mean that my brethren Oh Glory to God s where are we at Hallelujah them seven voices that cap the pyramid and them voices overcome the devil in every age every age it ever get blows blows blows blows blows blows and God take them seven voices and put it in you the devil must get blows this time oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to God there's going to be a clo no wonder the prophet said a Victorious Church a mighty Army Hallelujah that cannot be defeated Invincible he call her oh glory to God why because all them voices from Seven Ages already overcome Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God God always had the power to combat the enemy whether is the lion anointing where is the man anointing where is the eagle anointing where is the ox anointing he always believe an anointing to fight back that devil and if there's going to be a bride if there's be a super church if there's going to be a super race they God have an anointing to fight back that devil oh give the Lord some Praises tonight there got to have an anointing glory to God hallelujah who want to preach mystery and old talk and long talk let them talk the talk I have nothing to do with that we're here to preach these promises by these promises you become partakers of his divine nature Hallelujah Glory yes Lord it's not about you it's about him yes Lord it's not about me it's about him may be seated Too Many Men injecting themselves in this thing and injecting themselves in the people too many men parading the beef and have smell it my love the beef parade parade of Flesh and self and God want to kill men and of dead men the man come out of the way and God could speak to his people brother Bram wow this reflected his loving noble character God reflected in a man called Jesus Christ he was the only one could do this there was no other correct in heaven could do it he was the sinless nature he was the word the sinless nature of God he was the word expressed which was the word from the beginning and if you are in the Lamb's Book of Life you was God expression from his thought he seen you he seen your desire before there was even an atom or anything else you are his thought made word and expressing what you are now oh glory to God Hallelujah God knew who would reject him and who would accept him who would receive him who would fool around he know all about that and he could set things in order to make it play out the right way oh glory to God so listen to The Prophet now objective so just so that you could understand what I'm trying to get to here a reflection you have got to be identified it's a must and if you are you in go was thinking at the beginning and was his reflection here on Earth you will be you will be a record of the Heavenly as he B record of the Heavenly and when he raised up from the grave and was given a body we when we raise up will have a body like his own glorious body then he said his word the resurrection is sure it's a guarantee and we have the earnest of it now as the Holy Spirit comes in and identify us as God's redeemed person Oh you mean God have to ident ify us as redeemed oh yes redeem your soul redeem your spirit redeem there's only one more remaining is just the body oh give the Lord some Praises but a bride will stand on the earth with Soul and Spirit fully redeemed a perfect man on the earth with the character of Jesus Christ Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God you can't you wouldn't be able to hide that identification he said he God will let it

receive the Holy Ghost you are sealed till the journey is over that is your token that you hold that shows that your fear has been paid you are a redeemed character oh the token becomes evidence that we are redeemed character and then in that position we could present the token you can't present what you don't have you when you go for bus the bus man asking for money in the bus asking for the ticket the ticket is evidence you pay a price to get the ticket you have to go buy the boot and pay for it the man only authorized to collect ticket anytime he collecting money we know something cuckoo there taking something extra but that is not the author authorization you have to have the ticket the ticket is the token and the ticket is the identification that you have a right to board oh give the Lord some Praises you have a right to board the identification identifies that you are Bor on that bre watch this now your redeemed character Satan has no business with you none whatever just pick up your and show him my healing is paid my trip to glory is paid Hallelujah he has no bus with you now watch but Ram says when the fire fell in your upper room the same fire promised of the father and he had to stagger like drunk but and and shake and tremble and come down speaking in tongues the devil's run and tell listen they having a time up there he don't wor they excited the devil thought they was just having a kind of regular message you believe in you know mean message excitement right now you don't have much of that you know say listen to educated people talk so after that Jubilee experience now when Peter raised the man from the man Sil that was a serious thing when they report that said no this is serious business we can't s on that all the time the books and TP we leave them just like that let them press play we leave them press and play right through there's no problem they could PR out to the tribulation period I would leave them alone I wouldn't touch them on their FA with them they would go nice message folks message people you understand I'm saying then but when you see the signs and the Wonders and the power ah praise God not in on the tape what I'm do you know what the bride will continue to do the same Jesus hallelujah what he's done and the bride continue another book of Acts another day of Pentecost Oh Glory to God the prophet's prophecy when that become flesh and become alive the devil says stop them turn up the Press turn up United Nations get the laws going shut them down close them down oh glor to God oh feeling good tonight glory to God they can't close us down for books and tapes come on now we can't close us down for arguing and this one fighting that one like a Dy battle bunch of foolishness ministers arrogant as ever we have it here and them and those hallu continue I want to go there tonight Hallelujah that's that's right he said watch a token is what you use in a bus ride airplane your ticket is your token take your token you're redeemed the blessing the Holy Spirit and then Satan try to push something on you you show him this that is your identification Oh Glory to God you identify in the resurrection of Christ you identify in his death when you die you identify in his resurrection and by that it identify you that you were with him before the foundation of the world cuz you are redeemed Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah that's brought back all the father had given me will come notice he was sinless to take the place of the sinful the antidote he was without sin that he might redeem Sinners and brother Bram now this was the perfect lamb Christ was and went through the shed of shed of this lamb the natural lamb in Egypt the blood was applied then it was it stood for token and that would be the blood of this lamb stand for and listen the token that we are dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice then the lamb the blood and the person become identified together so that's why when they killing the lamb you have to put your hand on it you can't say God blood that taking your life you that you know you was to die you know the lamb DED in your stead so you put your hand on the lamb and the priest cut the neck and you feel when the life the spirit life leaves the lamb and you know you should have died and that lamb taken your place therefore you identify maybe a hand get blood than it but you identify with that lamb there that sacrifice isn't that right the sacrifice and the believer you identified in his life by your sacrifice then the blood was a token of identification the blood identify that the worshipper had slain the lamb accepted the lamb and applied the toen to himself he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it it was placed in a position that everybody passing by could see that token there's no private Christianity there's no private believer there's no private you want nobody know nobody see you have to understand your testimony has to become public so stop sining in private because all would have private had to come public so many people want to be Christian they want to do it secretly nobody would think that they're Christians they associates they run with think well I I want to be a Christian I don't want so and so to know about it see Christianity has to display its token publicly in public life at the office on the street when troubl is around anything in church everywhere else the blood is the token the token must be applied even the Covenant is not in effect now listen to the part I want to get to the blood we get inspiration from the blood was a token or an identification identifying this person who has been redeemed and the blood now is the Holy Ghost so the token which is the entire life from Faith all the way to charity is an identific oh wo one man brother Bram he had that he had the full atonement and that's why when the woman come up to him on deep the deep and she bunks and she

mind oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I we going to have a 700 Revival why because I say so no because God said so and God can't lie all right been really good Hallelujah his sinful nature expressed God's word hallelujah and the only way that you will ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you will have to have that sinless nature that comes from God hallelujah this is very deep before the foundation of the world you was recognized with him yes Lord before the word word can ever express itself through you it takes a sinless nature to do that in Miami I told them have you ever considered what it is to have a voice without a life a voice without being a live voice it's just words a man could talk and I talk understand when Jesus told the devil it is written it wasn't a human natural man with words he had a life behind that as it written yes hallu you get it now so it really take a little voice does the T that shakes the devil you have an ex stand that don't shake devil at all the fact that it have a tunn that shake him it have one that doesn't shake at all he said the devil don't care much you jump and Shout but when he see that life that mean you can shout preach talk exal say and everything else and devil say oh oh forget it that's your reputation that's not his character because I met that character before I met It Through the Ages I saw the character in Peter I saw it in William Brown Hallelujah and when I see it in a bride I will know because I encounter that oh give the Lord a shout you're not here to impress me I'm not here to impress you we have to impress God he said that God can see faith and virtue and knowledge operating in us that God must see that the pastor God hallelujah that God can see these things operating in us myall so much he was the word full the word flow through him so freely that he could speak the word it would create that show he was who can create but God no other nature could do it no other nature could no character nothing in heaven nothing else that's why he said who is worthy to take the book Angels nobody has had the character except Christ man when he was bornn in sin shape iniquity comes into the world speaking lines is that right there's nothing in him at all so you see if he was in God's thoughts watch how we connect this that brother George man sin iniquity speaking lies but if he was in God's thoughts when he come to the world he come in God thoughts at the beginning to display his attribute do you follow me listen to these words then Jesus came to break the clouds back so the attribute could display itself so we born in s we smoking drinking fooling wrong and whatnot right all right Jesus come to break the clouds that the attribute which is the thought could display itself and our display is through the word now we bypass the word part so we come from thought to flesh that's drama the drama in thought and flesh is plenty drama because now you could face Temptation and trials and testing and whatnot what we did not know is that the tempt and nral testing was the means by which God will form us to the word image so your trials and testings is more important to you than you think you seen it as pressure pressure pressure but God SE is are shaping shaping shaping oh give the Lord some Praises come on now give the Lord a shout glory to God I'll say it again your trials and testing means more to you than you think you feel you were dead you will not die oh give the Lord some Praises this go kill me it will not kill you God trying to do something to you for you through You by youall He Is God expressed word nothing else could be manifested other the other characters were Fallen he came as a redeemer and Redeemer means to bring it back okay it was God's T you think little you little me no one in the world would take my place nobody can take yours you being a Christian filled with the spirit of God and before the foundation of the world God seen you here this part and know every feature that you got that is like a car that's some features I drive a car ready and the Mount of features have it I didn't use it some I want to know where the manufacturers put for I ain't pressing this I a't pressing that means NOS is all kind ofs around there all I know press drive but have plenty fancy things I have no time for that I want to go from one distance to the next but have plenty features well you have plenty features too oh glory god put the features inside of you you know add this know he put it inside of you it going and unfold it going and express it going and manifest itself God put that that is builtin oh give the Lord a shout built it inside of you Hallelujah glory to God he know every feature that you got see Jesus come to bring you back that's what Jesus was here for the human body to bring you back he had to come to be a human as a redeemer to display his attributes as Savior he come to redeem you and bring you back from where you come from he bringing you back from where you come from you bypass the word but you're going back to the word that's why you are here to hear the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and you had to be a thought to be expressing the word to become like God at that day you shall know oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my my man the life that's in you never did begin Hallelujah that is zo that's not breett Oh Glory to God that's not that's not the atmosphere inside of you when God give it the holy ghost that is zo that's eternal life that's life that never did begin that life cannot end oh give the Lord some Praises Jesus came to redeem that being the son the fullness of God had to come and become that the sinless character of God did that that he might redeem these other thoughts that was coming to him to make a wife he missing that wife for nothing oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and here we come to the invitation tonight God identify himself as we are he took his strain what he was his strain as God and stretched his tent down here and become human he made himself a tent a body to live in and that body known as Jesus God lived in Christ he become human in order to save us he took upon him our form that he might mold us his character and his character was he did everything that pleased God he stayed with the word and that is what he wanted us for we stay with the word find our place and then know where we are at stay with his word and think we are invited to shape our own character to his that's the invite some people just go to church and the religious and so on but this is the invitation all right you are invited to shape our own character to his now we're going to find out what we have done shape our character to his own by his own Spirit then we by him are sons of God just what I've expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to his he only did that which pleases God he know who he was so truly this Great Mighty Seven under Revelation is an invitation to be formed into the word image the word image of Jesus Christ you are invited brother said to come and take his character Hallelujah by having his character in you it molds you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do the word molds God's character to us and anything that try to be mixed with the character breaks the mole you can't mix Creed with the word you can't mix the world with the word word you can't you can't serve God and Mammon watch you can't mix oil and water it won't mix your character will not mix with the world if if you are being molded in the form of God by letting the mind of Christ was in you that's the controlled tower now if you lived that day and was a member of some fine Church of resing council fine Pastor what side would it be on what side would your character now place you on so he is showing here that character is what places people that's it in other words somebody Ling for knowledge and information they are delighted to be in a church where the pass is intellectual and he gets his Revelation inspiration and from knowledge so he could spend four hours piping thoughts that blow in their mind and Sayo without a promise from the prophet educated guesses and explanations all right let me head the home here now wow but Bram I said a moment ago that the false Vine will come to full fruit sh her fruit would mature and ren that is correct this evil spirited church church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein large the fs of the a at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that that the bright church here we go will mature and her rightness here we go shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical Force Demons of Darkness come against the True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come and the bride and groom will be United forever but what I want to get you is that her rightness her ripeness shall be an identification with the Lord Hallelujah by means of the word hallelujah you say ripe Hallelujah then you could take the word Oh Glory to God because the word is going to identify how righte you are when that word bust on you and break on you and your response to it the word will testify whether you are ripe or notu all right let me hit the home stretch here now let me see uh page seven now going to page eight we just have 12 pages but BR scripture we read Jesus appear among his disciples walking he withhold himself from them from him knowing him so the thought was just a man so Jesus said what going on said but you know what going on The Stranger In This Place Jesus of Nazareth crucified and long testimony and S and Jesus busted them he call them fools where some people call them fool they leave the church one time last first and last service call them fools nothing that he call them slow of heart all your dull you I mean your mind dull three and a half years are talking his word to you and know you seey you know slow of heart to believe all what the prophet said watch him this is Brother BR he refers right back to the word of God he never come right out and told them don't you know me I'm the Messiah that's resurrected he never said that so when pastors go in par the beef sh muscles and parading Jesus never did that Hallelujah he never said that he just give them the scripture like John did who are you are the Messiah voice of one CR of wilderness go and read your Bible John never sees that he just voice one CR go read the scriptures I sh you the approach they had to pick that out themselves they had to judge for themselves judge for yourself fool slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said come to pass what a rebuke to them that claim they knew him notice here we goang how he approached the subject he never come right out and said uh well don't you know I'm your mist Messiah for this age don't you know that I am he the real servant of God never Clarance never identify himself that way the scripture identify who he is this is thus sayth the Lord he called your attention to what the prophet said what took place oh fools slow of heart not to believe all that the prophet said about the Messiah so he as John let the word of the Bible identify what he was to them oh give the Lord some Praises so brother Bram is a total separation we are not to go back in the world no more he said or have anything to do with the world but cleave to God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that is separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age We Liv in she's separated only to God and he is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word becomes one for the word is living through the bride that's her credentials that's her identification what's identification I I believe trumpets what what's I have a book called who what's identification I have a picture of the Prophet with clo over your head what's our identification the word living through the bride why don't the ministers tell the people that why do they tell the people that what is being preached and what they have is better than anybody else this word living in the bright is for everywhere you know that not a local thing you know that not a Trinidad thing you know there's the bride we talking about there's not Church me can live wherever they want to live but the bride will have the word living in them you see we still have to come to the Cross Jesus when he was presenting Promises to the disciples the most do shall do also what he came to the spot where he said okay my hour not yet come you can't touch me then he come to say it might always come then except a corner we fall in the ground and die about alone so he's bring them now to the Cross he's bringing them now where not only he going to die but they going to die Hallelujah and we have to come to our cross also Hallelujah I don't think any message will come to that yet the any message that's all because you have to come into ripeness to die you don't bury a green seed you bury a ripe seed God has to bake you out so when you think you're ready now God say hey ground now and I'll build a cross for you bang bang bang you going hang up there nowall anony boy wow you stop saying amen right now he boy wow I miss so nothing wrong with that but this is the reality now when Jesus fed the 3,000 and whatnot and next next service 5,000 because here bread and fish Bel out wo boy this man multiplying bread by bringing the whole family this time I alone was there but now everybody come because me you know I mean and Jesus had to bust the wood on them break the W on them now they seen him as a deliverer this seem as a conqueror to conquer and challenge Rome and Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world Hallelujah he start to pump you heard in time II Truth for truth but I sayto you love your enemies do good to them that and he start to talk a different kind of I didn't come here for that I come to how much SW we could get to fight Rome and fight press and fight the government and fight this and and pet that to because he draw saw the night and cut man ears off and like that and inside that Fearless an Peter Sword Jesus take the no s playing time now trying to show you gallantry time for the Lord just flesh beef you pure beef there on this plan go deny me when he come you was my no no not me when Peter finished he crying he really thought he was Stronger on he's standing but the test come the pressure come but Power was coming because Jesus prophesied over him after you are converted strengthen your brethren hlj they don't talk about conversion in this church in this message brother George they don't want in message you believe it there a set of Baptist in the message 95% of the mess world is baptism executive baptism glorified Baptist they believe when they believe it they have it and this bride I the eye in the bride I see myself in the word and what not the only way they talk in that Championship talk thing is because come they are yet to face the test and the test will bring out what's in the character what's ins the person let me see I can finish here let's strike this here how to finish this brother brandham talking about Joseph Pharaoh made Joseph his son and Christ makes his prisoners of love his sons he give them power in John 14:12 I want to skip quickly notice Joseph before he came out he had to be taken out and shaved a few things had to be shaved off before he could meet his King and God sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own Wills off this is personal now to show them they can't do just what they wanted to do now you hear me of times say a man conviction is more powerful than the word you will hear people talking about a standing from conviction but conviction off key the word say so but you stand for conviction I dream this and this dream mean that who said so God tell you that have Prophet interpret your dream suppose you dream backwards suppose you see it the wrong way you I'm saying yes you're going on with dream but what did the word say that some Dre I just come open my eye and just walk I'm not a prophet I can interpret it so instead of i t myself oh Json whatever it is whatever it is I that what God says that that is it I sure is I ain't sure the dream but you see what this word say here I guarantee this car fail I guarantee it know if could it be what if it's so what if it's not so is Lotto is playway I have no time with that so you have to shave off a few of our own wheels off shows them that they can't do just what they wanted to doall could we mature enough to come to this spot where you really want to surrender your will in in so much that you will go where God where you don't want to go but God sending you that's a tough one you know that family that Aunt that family you don't talk with and what God say go to them and you talk to last 20 years and God telling you go to them because God want to do something through you for them but because is your family and because you have no words with them you stand by Spirit trying to push you and you're resisting we have to come to that place where God can lead us listen where we don't want to go but isn't that what God told Peter that another would lead you where you don't want to go led by the spirit that's another level you know that's not communication going back home you know that is God directing your heart the leading of the Lord he said shaves a few of our own well time going so fast shows them they can't do just what they wanted to do you know what I mean they're not in Liberty to do what they wanted to do before you could come into full power prophecy when the Press come down what's the third P then okay before the all of that people like talk that talking when the Press come down what you listen to this before they could come into full power this is what attracts me these are the coach that has connect with me because I seeing how you say the process then because you could see the big contract and whatnot but the process to get to where you're supposed to be the fine print here before they could come into full power and be a love slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and then presented he didn't stop there he continues sometimes he takes them to the desert Amen to do that Amen to shave them off and that desert might be a literal desert you that desert might be a desert experience in your life you know what is to being a desert in the spirit realm where you're not feeling anything when it is dry when it is hot where it is burning and it seem like God don't even hearing your prayer but you're in a desert to do what to be saved Hallelujah save amen Somebody hallu Sometime he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he ordained them to be you see what I mean we are the Brethren remember all of the times what he's done he always had to take a man and make a prisoner to him forsake his own he had to forsake everything that he know forget all of his trainings everything in order to the will of God and to follow God he can't follow anything that man has got to do and God at the same time you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going right and left at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time you can't be following man and God at the same time either following God or following man that if you are following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to God and to the word and to what will no matter what anybody else says you become a prisent I'm going to finish we on page 10 head to 11 we only have 12 Pages God is known God is not known by education that's a fact he is not known by how to explain it and boy could explain it in his message you talk about explain it they could explain it God is known by Simplicity and of revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person upon it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I be my church no other rocks accept it no other Protestant Rock no other school but exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he's born in there he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projected itself through you with the and works and signs and wonders he did here we go by lack of this Revelation is why we have so much different divisions Among Us so Revelation doesn't bring division lack of let me say it again Revelations don't bring divisions the lack of Revelation and Revelation is God thoughts revealed that's Revelation is not you study because Peter just spoke it that the Christ and Jesus said Flesh and Blood hath not feel is unto you but my Father in heaven and Peter wasn't educated it came from the father straight down into his heart it confess it with his lip it was God that's Revelation Oh Glory to God Hallelujah by lack of Revelation that's why we are so much divisions among us so much mockery so much division Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation they lack the Revelation the teachers so if the teachers lack Revelation what they teaching with knowledge information they don't have re reation the mighty teachers in the message lack Revelation and they still teaching and they will continue teaching straight to the tribulation because Revelation is Faith I take Faith to be translated you I Rapture in faith not Raptor in knowledge Rapture in faith not Raptor in knowledge Rapture in fith all right this the home stret here now think musician come please by the living presence of the Living God living presence Living Word by his own personal Vindication Pro this church remember but think of it people are born of a spirit in a day like this and the word is a seed is

presence here we go here the Bumble up in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself self The Living Word what's promised for the day Express itself through a Vindication

group not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them they'll be two in a field I'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrender to God he don't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the word expressing itself to the church and to the world oh give the Lord some Praises I'm almost done Hallelujah let's continue still reading not say my church my church has nothing to do with it I'm reading it's an individual one person and he dropped the BM here now all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth if you catch it tonight you are free all hell against this individual Revelation coming to the bride to you personally personally not one here of your head Shall Perish you are mine I'll raise up in the last days and give him eternal life there it is the Revelation not them but him the individual not a group an individual he said all he said again all H against it because you are one you one is a majority in God
