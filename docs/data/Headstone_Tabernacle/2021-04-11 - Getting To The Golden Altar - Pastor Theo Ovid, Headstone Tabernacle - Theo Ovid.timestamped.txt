[46:51] driven out of presence this presence of
[46:53] god was

[47:01] just talking word and and talking a
[47:03] letter and

[47:10] to come back in the presence thank you
[47:11] brother steven
[47:13] for the service this morning some
[47:15] services
[47:16] [Music]
[47:19] very strange i um
[47:24] uh the last message i preached was uh
[47:26] the book written with in on the backside
[47:29] sealed with seven seals and an
[47:31] inspiration
[47:32] with about the spoken word the written
[47:34] word and the living word
[47:36] and yesterday preparing for today i
[47:40] just went back to see the scriptures
[47:42] that that that i read in in that
[47:45] in that message and the scene i read was
[47:47] version 5127
[47:49] and version 10 1 to 8 and version eight
[47:51] one strange enough descriptions i have
[47:54] today is almost like a continuation
[47:55] version five verse eight
[47:57] russian eight one to six and there's
[48:00] just two scripts we're gonna read this
[48:01] morning
[48:02] and um i just believe that
[48:06] somehow it's all connected and it's it's
[48:09] just something that god maybe have in
[48:10] his mind for
[48:11] to share with us this morning but before
[48:14] i get into what i want to get to this
[48:15] morning i want to reflect back
[48:17] on something i shared in a prayer
[48:20] meeting
[48:21] about the brass altar i want to get to
[48:24] that
[48:25] uh i think yes the spirit of burning
[48:30] i that this was the 19th of march and i
[48:32] permitting i read from isaiah 4 1
[48:36] and 4 when the lord shall have washed
[48:38] away the filth of the daughters of zion
[48:40] and shall have purged the blood of
[48:41] jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[48:44] spirit of judgment
[48:45] and by the spirit of burning and we're
[48:48] identifying that the spirit of judgment
[48:50] is the spirit of burning
[48:51] that's how god really cleansed by that
[48:54] spirit of burning
[48:55] that come by the fire of god exodus
[48:58] chapter four to be ready scripture i
[48:59] think i put a text out that you could
[49:01] have read it yourself
[49:02] um i came to pass in the first month in
[49:04] the second year on the first day of the
[49:06] month
[49:07] that the timeline was read up and moses
[49:09] read up the tabernacle
[49:10] fasten his sockets and set up the balls
[49:13] the boards thereof
[49:14] and put the bars thereof and raid up his
[49:16] pillars and he spread abroad a tent over
[49:19] the tabernacle
[49:20] and put the covering of the tent above
[49:21] it as the lord commanded moses
[49:23] he he took and put the testimony into
[49:26] the ark
[49:27] set the staves on the ark and put the
[49:29] mercy seat
[49:30] above the ark and he brought the ark
[49:32] into the tabernacle and set up the veil
[49:34] of the covering of the act of testimony
[49:36] so he sets it in order
[49:38] what moses did he put the act and he put
[49:39] the veil he's coming down now because he
[49:41] saw a vision
[49:42] and god telling what you see in heaven
[49:44] put it on earth
[49:45] as a sample of it right and he brought
[49:48] the ark into the tabernacle
[49:50] set up the veil for the covering and
[49:52] cover the ark of the testimony in the
[49:54] law
[49:54] as the lord commanded moses and he put
[49:56] the table
[49:57] in the tent of the congregation upon the
[49:59] side of the tabernacle northward
[50:01] without the veil that table which is the
[50:03] shoe bread schubert table on one side
[50:06] he set the bread on it in order upon it
[50:09] before the lord
[50:10] as the lord had commanded moses and he
[50:12] put the candlesticks in the tent of the
[50:14] congregation
[50:14] over against the table so on this side
[50:17] is the table of shoe bread
[50:18] and that side is the candle six i think
[50:20] the juice called the menorah
[50:22] that is what they have on the other side
[50:23] all right and he lighted the lamps
[50:25] before the lord as the lord commanded
[50:27] moses
[50:27] and he put the golden altar in the tent
[50:31] of the congregation before the veil
[50:34] so before you're going to the inner veil
[50:36] you have this
[50:37] golden altar that is represented right
[50:40] there just before the veil
[50:41] you can't go into the veil without
[50:43] passing this golden
[50:46] altar and watch he put the golden oats
[50:49] in the tent of the congregation before
[50:50] the veil
[50:51] and he burns sweet incense thereon as
[50:54] the lord commanded moses
[50:56] and he set up a hanging at the door of
[50:57] the tabernacle and he put
[50:59] the altar of burnt offering by the door
[51:02] of the tabernacle
[51:04] of the tent of the congregation and
[51:06] offered upon it the burnt offering
[51:08] and the meat offering as the lord
[51:10] commanded moses
[51:12] so as soon as you open the door of the
[51:14] tabernacle you see
[51:15] the altar there that's the burnt
[51:18] offering altar
[51:19] otherwise known as the brisbane altar
[51:21] all that type in jesus christ
[51:23] so the first you can't miss it it is
[51:25] right in front of you
[51:26] you can't get around it you can't
[51:28] squeeze around it the first thing as
[51:30] they open the door
[51:31] is a brazen altar where you have to
[51:33] bring your sacrifice
[51:34] oh hallelujah praise the lord and the
[51:37] brazen altar
[51:38] was like the key element of the timeline
[51:39] in the wilderness a place
[51:41] where the israelites brought the animals
[51:43] to offer as an atonement for their sins
[51:46] and it reminded them that they were not
[51:48] worthy to approach a holy god
[51:50] without first offering blood sacrifice
[51:53] for sins
[51:54] or give the lord some praises
[51:57] leviticus chapter one and the lord call
[51:59] unto moses and speak unto him
[52:01] out of the tabernacle of the
[52:02] congregation saying speak unto the chair
[52:04] of israel and say unto them
[52:05] if any man of you bring an offering unto
[52:08] the lord
[52:08] you shall bring your offering of cattle
[52:11] even of the herd of the flock
[52:12] it is an offering to be burnt it to be
[52:14] burnt sacrifice of the hood
[52:16] let him offer a meal with our blemish he
[52:19] say
[52:20] what to bring not bring anything
[52:23] he's given specifics until that day
[52:25] we're going to see how god is very
[52:27] specific he specifies what he wants and
[52:30] how he wanted
[52:31] not what we think or what we feel you
[52:32] know is what he specifies
[52:35] you say a male watch he said without
[52:38] blemish
[52:39] he shall offer it of his own voluntary
[52:43] will at the door of the tabernacle
[52:46] nobody forcing you
[52:47] voluntarily watch and he shall put his
[52:50] hand upon the head of the burnt offering
[52:53] so he can't watch it and kill it that
[52:56] daddy bundle friend you know no no you
[52:57] have to put your hand
[52:58] you have to be identified with the burnt
[53:00] offering you can't be disturbed from it
[53:03] you can't watch it you can't say there's
[53:04] a good offering you know there's a good
[53:06] bull
[53:06] no no no you have to put your hand on it
[53:08] because that bull represent you
[53:10] you was the one that was supposed to die
[53:13] you was the one that worthy of debt
[53:15] and now you're going to feel the life
[53:16] leave this animal
[53:18] that's as you that you were supposed to
[53:20] die and this animal took your place
[53:22] and you have to get the experience of

[53:42] for him to make an atonement for him oh
[53:44] my
[53:45] hallelujah and by laying his hands upon
[53:47] the head of the offering
[53:48] the person was identifying with the
[53:50] sacrifice his sin and guilt was being
[53:52] moved
[53:52] from himself to the animal that is what
[53:55] that represented
[53:56] oh glory to god that's why all these
[53:57] prophets could be considered righteous
[53:59] because they was able to go and make an
[54:02] offering and they burnt sacrifice
[54:04] and when god accepted that they were as
[54:06] if they were righteous
[54:08] oh glory that's why the bible talked

[54:15] offering
[54:16] that was presented on your behalf and

[56:43] actually die and be born again you say
[56:46] you've got to feel so guilty
[56:48] when you stand in his presence whether
[56:51] you go to the methodist way or baptist
[56:52] way whatever way you go

[57:21] your worldly life right there closing
[57:24] this part our souls are placed by faith
[57:27] on his brass altar god's judgment
[57:30] and our offering is consumed
[57:34] when our souls are placed on his divine
[57:36] judgment that is brass
[57:38] when our soldiers placed upon an altar
[57:40] of divine judgment
[57:42] what was the penalty debt so when you
[57:45] put your soul on the altar
[57:46] is to kill you that you will be dead
[57:49] yourself
[57:50] and alive in christ jesus and when you
[57:53] lay yourself up on the altar of god
[57:56] which is pronounced debt upon the sinner
[57:58] how can you raise someday alive in sin
[58:01] if god accepted the sacrifice and i want
[58:04] to say this
[58:05] how could a man claim to have been on
[58:08] that brass altar
[58:09] and still have a heart
[58:12] it is impossible to be burnt at that
[58:15] bass altar
[58:16] and come out with one heart against
[58:19] anybody
[58:20] because when that fire burned you so you
[58:23] know that god forgive you
[58:25] and if god forgive you you mean you
[58:27] can't forgive your brother
[58:29] you can forgive your sister you can't
[58:31] drop your hearts
[58:32] when this alters brotherly kindness in
[58:35] the altar of this age of brotherly
[58:36] kindness
[58:37] and the spirit the holy spirit coming on
[58:40] top
[58:40] brotherly kindness and your whole
[58:42] english and ought and evil and malice
[58:45] and wickedness
[58:47] fire have to get that
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:51] [Music]
[58:54] you maybe said oh minnesota claim you're
[58:57] adopted with oats and grudge

[59:00] seedlings congregation with negative and
[59:01] nasty business go go and end up that
[59:03] that's not the word here you know
[59:05] god break mega offering god must accept
[59:07] it you could show whatever often god
[59:09] must accept it
[59:10] and when god accepted fire this fall
[59:13] oh glory to god when god accept your
[59:17] offering
[59:18] and you got to present your body
[59:22] you got to act you got to present your
[59:24] body as a living sacrifice
[59:27] you become the sacrifice upon god's
[59:29] presulta
[59:30] what give the lord a shout because i
[59:33] have a time this morning
[59:34] this is a special service praise god
[59:37] you'll never forget it
[59:39] oh hallelujah
[59:42] but i might say when your sacrifice has
[59:44] been received you are dead
[59:47] when that when that sacrifice is
[59:49] received by fire it goes up like that
[59:51] and the smoke goes up
[59:52] and you rise with the sacrifice into the
[59:54] heavenlies you are sealed away from the
[59:56] things of the world
[59:57] and then you are conceived anew you were
[59:59] conceived on you
[1:00:00] you once was conceived in iniquity know
[1:00:03] your conceiva knew
[1:00:04] oh praise the name of the lord then you
[1:00:06] become the living word
[1:00:08] and then he read the scripture here from
[1:00:09] the future home
[1:00:11] and he said when the lord shall have
[1:00:13] washed away the filth
[1:00:14] of the daughter of zion remember that's
[1:00:16] the bride
[1:00:17] and shall have purified the blood of
[1:00:19] jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews
[1:00:21] plus the bride
[1:00:22] in the midst thereof with the spirit of
[1:00:24] judgment
[1:00:25] fire that is always cause judgment when
[1:00:28] he makes his final judgment
[1:00:30] he calls you he justifies you and he
[1:00:32] brings you to redemption
[1:00:34] then his judgment pray for upon you and
[1:00:36] the holy ghost and fire
[1:00:38] cleanses away sin oh glory to god
[1:00:42] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:00:45] and when king uzziah died and isaiah
[1:00:47] went into the temple
[1:00:49] and he saw the vision of the lord he was
[1:00:51] high and lifted up
[1:00:52] and the trail filled the temple and
[1:00:54] isaiah said woe is me i'm undone
[1:00:57] i have a man on clean lips and then
[1:00:59] there comes some seraphs
[1:01:01] they take calls of the altar there's an
[1:01:03] altar in heaven
[1:01:04] oh glory to god that's why you're also
[1:01:06] on the earth because there's a whole day
[1:01:08] in heaven
[1:01:09] and they took the cause above the altar
[1:01:11] and then touch his lips
[1:01:12] he said the surfings are the burners the
[1:01:15] burners
[1:01:16] oh hallelujah not the explainers
[1:01:20] not the talkers these airframes are
[1:01:22] dependent you hear much about writing a
[1:01:25] message but there's still a burners
[1:01:27] it's still a fire instead of god's
[1:01:29] confirmation
[1:01:30] when you present your sacrifice oh my
[1:01:35] hallelujah the seraphim she says
[1:01:38] that this this seraphim was angelic
[1:01:40] beings and they are the very one next to
[1:01:42] god
[1:01:43] right at the altar and they receive the
[1:01:45] sacrifice
[1:01:46] it shows the justice of god that sin
[1:01:49] cannot come
[1:01:50] in the presence of god unless it has
[1:01:53] been atoned for
[1:01:55] oh my oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:01:59] so what that tells us friends we can't

[1:04:02] golden vials
[1:04:03] full of odors which are the prayers
[1:04:06] of the saints version 8 11
[1:04:10] 1 and when he had opened the seventh
[1:04:12] seal there was silence in heaven
[1:04:14] about a space of half an hour and i saw
[1:04:17] the seven angels which stood before god
[1:04:19] and to them was given seven trumpets
[1:04:22] and another angel came and stood at the
[1:04:24] altar having a golden censer
[1:04:27] and there was given unto him much
[1:04:29] incense that he should offer it
[1:04:31] with the prayers of all saints upon the
[1:04:33] golden altar
[1:04:34] which is before the throne and the smoke
[1:04:37] of the incense which came with the
[1:04:39] prayers of the saints
[1:04:41] ascended up before god out of the
[1:04:43] angel's hand
[1:04:44] and the angel took the censer and fill
[1:04:47] it with
[1:04:47] fire off the altar and cast it unto the
[1:04:51] earth
[1:04:51] and there were voices and thunderings
[1:04:53] and lightnings and an earthquake
[1:04:55] and the seven angels which had seven
[1:04:57] trumpets prepared themselves to song
[1:04:59] let's pray father we thank you
[1:05:01] for your word and lord there's no way i
[1:05:03] know how to present this
[1:05:04] it will take you and i ask you to take
[1:05:07] me out of the way
[1:05:08] and speak to your people today jesus if
[1:05:10] there's one time we need to hear from
[1:05:11] you is today
[1:05:12] speak to us as we wait on you in jesus
[1:05:15] name we ask it
[1:05:16] amen you won't be seated
[1:05:20] the last message i preached about the
[1:05:22] seven seals and so on like that
[1:05:24] i closed with this if jesus
[1:05:27] had to spend much time in prayer to stay
[1:05:31] in fellowship with the spirit that was
[1:05:34] in him how much more do you and i
[1:05:39] have to spend in prayer much
[1:05:42] time in prayer if you only knew what
[1:05:45] time
[1:05:45] in prayer meant sometimes when you were
[1:05:48] in prayer
[1:05:49] god changes the complete
[1:05:52] destination of different things that is
[1:05:56] going to happen
[1:05:57] do you believe that might be something
[1:05:59] fixing to happen and your prayer
[1:06:01] could change the whole situation
[1:06:04] and it's as if god subject himself to
[1:06:06] the law of prayer
[1:06:07] and god can't work except you pray there
[1:06:10] are certain things that he will do
[1:06:11] but when you pray and intervene that
[1:06:13] changes everything
[1:06:15] i'll give you an example when sarah
[1:06:18] abraham lied to the king and say sarah
[1:06:20] was his sister
[1:06:22] and god shot up the womans of everybody
[1:06:24] in that house
[1:06:25] and god told the man the king restored
[1:06:28] to my prophetess wife
[1:06:29] he said i didn't do no wrong is the man
[1:06:31] telling me that your sister he said i
[1:06:32] know that
[1:06:33] go and let him pray for you in other
[1:06:36] words god god couldn't undo that
[1:06:38] until abraham prayed that's the power
[1:06:42] prayer we're talking about
[1:06:43] that's the power god put in your hands
[1:06:45] and that's the power the devil don't
[1:06:46] want you to see
[1:06:48] and don't want you to get and i hope
[1:06:49] today a fresh revelation
[1:06:52] that will give you a different viewpoint
[1:06:53] of praying altogether
[1:06:55] oh glory to god hallelujah could you
[1:06:58] give the lord a shout this morning
[1:07:00] oh praise god praise god

[1:13:41] hallelujah brother branham
[1:13:47] he drove man out of it and placed man in
[1:13:50] the east of the garden of eden
[1:13:52] cherubims with a flying flying flaming
[1:13:54] sword which turned every way
[1:13:56] four beasts every four ways east west
[1:13:58] north and south these cherubims

[1:14:08] the tree of life
[1:14:09] see they are guarding and reflecting
[1:14:12] with the fire of god
[1:14:14] the way to the tree of life because god
[1:14:16] didn't want man to
[1:14:18] be in that condition and partake of
[1:14:20] eternal life
[1:14:21] write in me a bit do you remember what
[1:14:23] king and abel come up here to worship
[1:14:25] so it shows that god's altar okay don't
[1:14:28] back up sorry
[1:14:29] now i want you to show you now it's an
[1:14:32] altar
[1:14:33] oh let me just back up a little bit i
[1:14:35] think i want to get the full context
[1:14:36] here
[1:14:37] you notice these cherubims that john saw
[1:14:39] must have been interested in keeping the
[1:14:41] tree of life
[1:14:42] and they must be interested in human
[1:14:44] beings genesis they kept
[1:14:47] the tree of life and gathered it the way
[1:14:49] of life
[1:14:50] how is the way jesus said i am the way i
[1:14:52] am the bread that comes from heaven
[1:14:54] if a man eats this bread he lives
[1:14:55] forever now there is a way back
[1:14:58] to that tree of life you get it now i
[1:15:01] want you to show now and make this sure
[1:15:03] it's an altar
[1:15:06] the way back is what
[1:15:10] an altar
[1:15:13] now this must have been an altar at the
[1:15:15] garden of eden i'll tell you why
[1:15:17] do you remember both king and neighbor
[1:15:19] came here to worship so that shows that
[1:15:21] god's altar
[1:15:22] was moved and set here at the garden of
[1:15:24] eden
[1:15:25] and the only way back to eden is by the
[1:15:29] altar
[1:15:30] here you are again back to eden through
[1:15:32] the altar
[1:15:33] and they were to keep that deer and
[1:15:36] guard it
[1:15:36] that they couldn't get back dear until
[1:15:39] this altar was covered with blood
[1:15:43] so all the lamb blood was substitute
[1:15:45] because the real lamb was coming
[1:15:48] for this man offered
[1:15:51] his own blood once
[1:15:55] finished satan forever bring back
[1:15:58] son all glory or deliver
[1:16:01] sons delivered daughters this one man
[1:16:05] glory to god let's go
[1:16:08] there has to be a mercy there has to be
[1:16:11] an atonement
[1:16:13] a mercy seat there this alt of judgment
[1:16:15] must become a mercy seat
[1:16:17] when the altar if the blood is lifted
[1:16:19] they will stand on the judgment day
[1:16:21] the fire of god's wrath of god the tree
[1:16:23] again only thing will enter into this
[1:16:25] gate to eden will be to the blood of
[1:16:27] jesus christ
[1:16:29] both boys came to worship must have been
[1:16:31] god's altar is that right
[1:16:33] and here is the true altar of god it is
[1:16:35] the heart of man
[1:16:36] then dead another altar your heart
[1:16:40] oh glory to god isn't that right oh
[1:16:43] praise god
[1:16:44] so it must be an altar that they guarded
[1:16:46] praise god amen so hear this part now
[1:16:49] so cain what went out from the presence
[1:16:53] of the lord
[1:16:55] from the gate at the garden so the
[1:16:58] presence of the lord must have been at
[1:17:00] the altar
[1:17:05] and the altar was at the gate so to go
[1:17:08] back to
[1:17:09] eden you have to go back to the altar
[1:17:12] by the altar and through the altar let
[1:17:14] me say it this way by the brazen altar
[1:17:17] and through the golden altar oh glory to
[1:17:20] god you're going right back into
[1:17:21] presence
[1:17:23] oh hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:17:26] so moses was taken up into heaven and
[1:17:29] and saw the altar of god and he went up
[1:17:32] in the presence of god
[1:17:33] and whenever he sent one of the presence
[1:17:35] god told moses make everything on earth
[1:17:38] as patterned after heaven and when he
[1:17:40] did he made the act of the covenant
[1:17:43] put two cherubims to god the act what is
[1:17:45] it it was the temple was on the altar
[1:17:48] the throne gods when john was in the
[1:17:50] spirit
[1:17:51] he saw the throne gaze he saw the
[1:17:54] seraphims
[1:17:55] moses had a physical representation of
[1:17:58] two gold cherubims which rings touching
[1:18:00] each other
[1:18:00] covering the mercy seats they were
[1:18:02] represented of the throne gods
[1:18:05] oh glory that presence is guarded that
[1:18:07] throne is guarded
[1:18:09] oh glory to god are you with me and when
[1:18:12] he did he made the anchor the covenant
[1:18:14] and put two cherubims to guard the
[1:18:15] throne he told molemoto brass and put
[1:18:18] their wings touching like this
[1:18:20] that's exactly what john saw the guard
[1:18:23] on mercy seat
[1:18:24] oh my hallelujah you say you must be
[1:18:27] prepared before you can come into the
[1:18:28] presence of it
[1:18:29] let me back up a little bit he said
[1:18:31] where was it she kind of glory at the
[1:18:33] mercy seat
[1:18:34] is that right the guard that she kind of
[1:18:37] glory he will whoa
[1:18:38] listen friends then it goes to show that
[1:18:40] every scallywag
[1:18:42] can't come dear and take off that
[1:18:47] because this anointing this i will meet
[1:18:50] you in dear
[1:18:52] people power it's guarded
[1:18:55] oh go man could claim whatever they want
[1:18:57] let them keep claiming
[1:18:58] but this this what we're talking about
[1:19:00] today get our guards
[1:19:02] and have gods oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:06] praise the name of the lord
[1:19:08] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:12] o praise god amen are you in paul
[1:19:15] let's begin hallelujah
[1:19:19] hallelujah get into the golden order
[1:19:22] the only way back to eden is by the
[1:19:26] altar
[1:19:27] and to the altar o praise the name of
[1:19:30] the lord blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:35] okay
[1:19:36] but abraham if an altar is all that god
[1:19:39] requires
[1:19:40] cain was justified and cain made a
[1:19:43] sacrifice upon the altar is that right
[1:19:45] well if a sacrifice is an altar is all
[1:19:48] god wants
[1:19:49] came was justified then god also he
[1:19:51] built an altar and he worshiped
[1:19:52] he put a sacrifice on it and he long and
[1:19:55] worshipped god
[1:19:55] but god was displeased because he didn't
[1:19:58] come the right way
[1:20:00] so it's not an altar god wanted you know
[1:20:02] he won the writing on the altar
[1:20:04] oh give the lord a shout glory to
[1:20:08] god so cain did what he did but it was
[1:20:10] not enough
[1:20:12] cain was jealous of abel because god
[1:20:14] accepted abel's sacrifice
[1:20:16] and unable to despise faith by
[1:20:20] revelation abram take a rock
[1:20:23] able to take a rock and cut the throat
[1:20:25] of the lamb
[1:20:26] able to knew all glories continue seeing
[1:20:29] that the two boys trying to find favor
[1:20:31] with god
[1:20:32] to come back because they know that they
[1:20:34] were just fresh from the garden of life
[1:20:36] and they had fell on the other side by
[1:20:39] the transgression of their parents
[1:20:41] but had made them subjects to death but
[1:20:44] like we all stand this morning subject
[1:20:46] to death
[1:20:46] but they wanted to know how to get back
[1:20:49] into a place
[1:20:50] where they could find life again and in
[1:20:53] doing so
[1:20:54] they were trying to find favor with god
[1:20:57] but here well

[1:52:32] eliad
[1:52:33] and on the son of tilleth sons of reuben
[1:52:35] took men
[1:52:36] they rose up before moses with citizens
[1:52:38] of the church of israel 250 princes
[1:52:42] of the assemblies we have a gang famous
[1:52:45] in the congregation these are normal men
[1:52:46] these fellows that are
[1:52:47] high rank men of renown and they gather
[1:52:51] themselves together
[1:52:52] against moses and against aaron and said
[1:52:55] unto them
[1:52:56] you take too much upon you seeing all
[1:52:58] the congregation are holy
[1:53:00] every one of them and the lord is among
[1:53:03] them
[1:53:03] wherefore then lift up your cells above
[1:53:06] the congress of the lord
[1:53:07] and when moses heard it he fell on his
[1:53:10] face
[1:53:11] he spake unto quran and all this company
[1:53:13] saying even tomorrow
[1:53:15] the lord will show who are his and who
[1:53:18] is holy
[1:53:19] and will cause him to come near unto him
[1:53:22] even him whom he had chosen
[1:53:24] will be caused to come near unto him so
[1:53:26] moses drop a prophecy in him one time
[1:53:28] he said the more recently in this verse
[1:53:31] six this dude take your censors
[1:53:33] quora and all his company put fire there
[1:53:36] in
[1:53:37] put incense in them before the lord you

[1:53:41] daniel's incense censor is a witness to
[1:53:45] god a prayer to god they understand
[1:53:47] nothing
[1:53:47] so moses said oh you get a censor put
[1:53:50] your incense inside of this
[1:53:51] go to god with that hallelujah verse
[1:53:54] seven
[1:53:54] put fire there in and put incense in
[1:53:56] them before the lord tomorrow and it
[1:53:58] shall be that the man
[1:53:59] whom the lord choose he shall be holy
[1:54:01] you take too much upon you sons of levi
[1:54:03] and moses said in the quran here i pray
[1:54:05] you you sons of levi
[1:54:06] seeing it but a small thing unto you
[1:54:08] that the lord of israel had separated
[1:54:10] you from the creation of israel
[1:54:11] to bring you near to himself to do the
[1:54:12] service to the time of the lord
[1:54:14] to stand before the congregation to
[1:54:15] minister unto them you have brought thee
[1:54:17] near to him and all the brethren the
[1:54:19] sons of levi with thee
[1:54:20] seek the priesthood also or is he going
[1:54:22] to be priests
[1:54:23] for which cause both dao and all my
[1:54:25] company are gathered together against
[1:54:26] the lord
[1:54:27] what is aaron against him and moses went
[1:54:30] to call dayton and
[1:54:32] abraham the sons of eliav which said we
[1:54:34] will not come up
[1:54:36] is it a small thing the dog has brought
[1:54:37] us up out of the land of fruit of milk
[1:54:39] and honey to kill us in the wilderness
[1:54:41] except don't make thyself a prince over

[1:54:48] vineyards will they'll put us or put out
[1:54:50] the eyes of these men we will not come
[1:54:52] up
[1:54:53] and moses was very wrought said unto the
[1:54:55] lord respect

[1:55:35] that is something hallelujah
[1:55:39] and the lord's taken the muslim iran
[1:55:41] saying separate yourselves from among
[1:55:43] this congregation

[1:57:16] for i have not done them of my own mind
[1:57:19] if these men die a common death of all
[1:57:22] men
[1:57:23] or if they be visited after the vision
[1:57:25] of all men then god has not sent me
[1:57:28] so moses tell them their judgment would

[2:04:52] come by a greater and more perfect
[2:04:55] tabernacle
[2:04:56] not made with hands neither by the blood
[2:04:58] of goats and by his own blood
[2:05:01] he entered in once into the holy place
[2:05:03] having obtained
[2:05:04] eternal redemption for us no man can't
[2:05:06] call jesus by the holy ghost he said now
[2:05:08] take
[2:05:09] the old tabernacle first thing they do
[2:05:11] they enter into the courts the gentile
[2:05:13] the next was the brazen altar there they
[2:05:16] washed the sacrifice of the golden lava
[2:05:18] next was the killing of the sacrifice to
[2:05:20] sprinkle the blood upon the altar
[2:05:21] once a year aaron anointed with the
[2:05:23] rules of sharon perfume
[2:05:25] and and on the and the oil coming down
[2:05:27] to his skirts and so on like that and so
[2:05:29] on like that he said no watch
[2:05:30] what i'm saying yeah brad i'm tabernacle
[2:05:33] you had your chance
[2:05:35] when a man once is anointed
[2:05:39] with the holy ghost to be adopted into
[2:05:42] the family of god
[2:05:44] to be positionally placed by the father
[2:05:47] and set into a service out there
[2:05:49] into his purpose of life what god called
[2:05:51] him to do his walk must be holy
[2:05:53] holy holy unto the lord
[2:05:56] so this is no game this is no gimmick
[2:06:00] this is the truth this is the world and
[2:06:02] i trust by doing the visuals
[2:06:04] and little video clips that it will
[2:06:05] edify you and strengthen you
[2:06:07] to understand how real this god is and
[2:06:09] how these things apply to us today
[2:06:12] you must turn aside and see this no holy
[2:06:14] holy unto the lord you must believe
[2:06:16] all of this holy holy unto the lord oh
[2:06:18] you must you must come over here no
[2:06:20] holy holy unto the lord isn't that right
[2:06:22] praise god
[2:06:24] so moses and elijah they have got the
[2:06:27] call he said now watch those two
[2:06:28] prophets remember
[2:06:29] the gentile bride is have a prophet
[2:06:31] elijah
[2:06:32] that's to call them out of their
[2:06:34] transition the bride
[2:06:36] just the same as these prophets called
[2:06:38] the jews or the judaism
[2:06:39] the christ the atonement the gentile
[2:06:43] already knows the atonement but it is
[2:06:45] called the bride back to the original
[2:06:47] atonement
[2:06:49] that is what we are called to not the
[2:06:50] atonement the original atonement
[2:06:52] that is what applied on the day of
[2:06:53] pentecost that was the original oh
[2:06:56] praise god amen
[2:06:58] hallelujah after the bride is raptured
[2:07:00] will any foolish voice be saved or will
[2:07:02] they be lost
[2:07:03] will the fuller be saved no whatever
[2:07:05] happens happens
[2:07:06] now after the time she is in a state now
[2:07:09] she will have to go through the
[2:07:10] tribulation period
[2:07:11] and the reason for it is is because she
[2:07:13] has rejected
[2:07:14] the atonement in its fullness she is a
[2:07:17] believer
[2:07:19] a professed believer but she will have
[2:07:21] to go through the tribulation period
[2:07:23] why because they have not accepted their
[2:07:25] two minutes fullness
[2:07:27] because to accept the atonement the
[2:07:28] atonement take your place
[2:07:31] you were supposed to die the atonement
[2:07:34] pay your price
[2:07:35] so that frees you to serve god that
[2:07:38] frees you
[2:07:38] to love god that frees you to become
[2:07:41] justified
[2:07:42] as you can never did sin that frees you
[2:07:45] from holding oughts and grudges
[2:07:47] and because of what people do to you you
[2:07:49] go free
[2:07:50] because of what the blood did oh
[2:07:53] hallelujah
[2:07:54] praise god praise god amen
[2:07:58] brother branham said your daily walk
[2:08:00] your daily behavior
