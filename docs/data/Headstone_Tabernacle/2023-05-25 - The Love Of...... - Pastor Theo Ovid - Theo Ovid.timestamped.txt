[25:59] [Music]
[26:02] and it's a beautiful thing to see a man
[26:04] come under divine inspiration
[26:07] picking back direct inspiration that's
[26:09] how it wasn't their Pentecost you know
[26:11] Peter came out and said this is a stone
[26:13] that is refused this is a stone I will
[26:15] set at naughty you build this isn't that
[26:17] right
[26:17] and it repeat again whatever's David's
[26:20] everywhere
[26:21] someday we're going to bring them out of
[26:23] the bushes
[26:24] I believe it all my heart
[26:27] the meaning of purpose the reason for
[26:29] which something is done or created or
[26:32] for which something exists
[26:33] want to see the picture you will never
[26:36] lose the image and your focus as the
[26:39] prophet said when you see the picture
[26:40] the rest is a fill a material because
[26:42] you see the real thing
[26:44] predestination is according to purpose
[26:47] purpose precedes predestination purpose
[26:50] is the controlling factor in life
[26:51] purpose is greater than your comfort
[26:53] desires ambition or complaints purpose
[26:56] is determined by his Council if that was
[26:59] tremendous that was tremendous real
[27:01] blessing for us I pray that God really
[27:03] bless his son and servant
[27:08] tonight I'd like to to enter two
[27:10] scriptures Matthew chapter 24 1 3 4 3 to
[27:14] 14.
[27:15] and Genesis chapter 29 verse 20.
[27:18] and the second scripture is a scripture
[27:20] that put Andrew lulin shared with me
[27:22] and it was so special to me that I said
[27:26] I want to use that scripture tonight
[27:28] but within Matthew 24
[27:31] reinforced tree and he sat upon the
[27:33] Mount of Olives
[27:36] and as he sat among the amount of all
[27:38] his disciples came up to him privately
[27:39] singing tell us when shall these things
[27:42] be what shall be the sign of thy coming
[27:44] out of the end of the world
[27:45] and Jesus answers the center to them
[27:47] take heed that no man deceive you for
[27:49] many shall come in my name saying I am
[27:51] Christ shall receive many he shall he
[27:54] have Wars rumors of wars see that he be
[27:56] not troubled for all these things must
[27:59] come to pass but the end is not yet
[28:02] for nation shall rise against Nation
[28:05] and Kingdom against Kingdom and they
[28:07] shall be famine and pestilencies and
[28:09] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[28:11] are the beginning of Sorrows then shall
[28:14] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[28:16] kill you and it shall be hated of all
[28:19] Nations for my name's sake
[28:21] and then shall many be offended and
[28:23] shall betray one another and shall hate
[28:26] one another
[28:27] many false prophets shall rise
[28:31] and shall receive many
[28:33] and because iniquitation among the love
[28:36] of many shall Works cold but he's at
[28:39] endured to the end the same shall be
[28:41] saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[28:44] shall be preached in all the world for
[28:46] witness unto all nations
[28:48] and then the end shall come
[28:50] and reading Matthew chapter 24
[28:53] uh we in Genesis chapter 29 verse 20.
[28:58] and it reads and Jacob served seven
[29:00] years for Rachel
[29:02] and they seem unto him but a few days
[29:04] for the love he had to her let's ball
[29:08] heads Heavenly Father we thank you for
[29:10] your presence tonight and always got it
[29:12] here and I pray a presence will reach
[29:14] out to brother Terence also to the
[29:15] conglis family fathered that your
[29:17] healing will go to them touch the
[29:18] Rosemary a special way for the George
[29:20] but it turns and brother Barry and all
[29:24] those who have challenges this will even
[29:26] this night father bless them in such a
[29:28] way that they will be able to hear and
[29:30] receive the word of God and any person
[29:32] sick Lord both here and online father
[29:36] God may you visit him in a special way
[29:37] and give them a release a relief granted
[29:40] Father and Jesus might ask it amen and
[29:43] father God as we approach your word
[29:44] tonight may your blessed Lord I'm
[29:46] thrilled by the scriptures I will
[29:48] represent what it means and I pray God
[29:51] that you Reveal Your word to us Lord
[29:53] bring divine revelation we have such a
[29:56] great need for divine revelation that
[29:58] your spirit will come and speak to our
[29:59] hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen you
[30:01] may be seated
[30:03] praise God I was dream title tonight
[30:06] the love of
[30:10] the love of that's what happens tonight
[30:13] the love of
[30:15] [Laughter]
[30:16] I was wondering if it's titled love of
[30:18] many shall walk school but they're so
[30:19] negative I don't want to go there this
[30:21] is the bride we're talking to so I could
[30:24] bring a contrast the love of or we could
[30:26] fit in there because the love of God the
[30:29] love of of resheld
[30:31] the love of many
[30:33] just the love of Amen so brother is
[30:38] talking about a man without the spirit
[30:40] of God would throw a baby out of a
[30:42] mother's arms and ravish her
[30:44] without God he's not much better than a
[30:47] beast
[30:47] he's still got that beast on on Godly
[30:50] nature
[30:51] they say religion takes you they say men
[30:54] went crazy religion religion is the only
[30:56] thing that man that give a man a right
[30:58] mind the religion of Jesus Christ I
[31:01] could prove by the Bible that you're not
[31:02] in the right mind until they are from
[31:04] Christ that's right that's pretty strong
[31:06] but I can prove by the scripture that
[31:08] you are beastly lustfully and everything
[31:11] until you have fun Christ Jesus he's a
[31:15] lovely one
[31:16] no I'll admit people study too hard
[31:19] and try to go too far ahead try to think
[31:22] too far and sometimes have mental
[31:25] breakdowns and things on account of
[31:27] studying about the Lord
[31:28] you must quit that
[31:30] you don't have to do that the only thing
[31:33] you have to do is to fall in love with
[31:34] him
[31:36] and just go right on loving him
[31:38] it's not trying to push into something
[31:41] or make yourself something you are not
[31:44] just go ahead and let God use you in the
[31:48] way he wants to
[31:49] just you yourself commit yourself and
[31:52] walk on Happy singing rejoicing that's
[31:54] the way
[31:56] the Bible said all things work together
[31:59] to them that
[32:01] love him
[32:03] so just be sure that you love him and
[32:05] the only thing you have to know amen
[32:08] just love him and walk on and say Lord I
[32:10] love you you know I love you is that
[32:12] wonderful tonight
[32:14] should I be talking a bit about love
[32:17] praise the name of the Lord Mary she
[32:19] said be it done unto me according to the
[32:21] words isn't that right and she went
[32:23] quickly to testify to Elizabeth about
[32:25] her baby and but I'm talking about God
[32:27] give us some more Mary's that can take
[32:30] God at this word before you see or feel
[32:33] anything you take him at his word I feel
[32:36] pretty good don't think I'm crazy I am
[32:38] happy just let me alone oh brother
[32:40] anyone that dared to take God at his
[32:42] word God said so she said it so and went
[32:45] to testify about it and if God said he
[32:48] would heal you if you believe him take
[32:49] him at his word don't look how crippled
[32:52] you are how blind you are take him out
[32:54] his word and start testifying about it
[32:57] God is obligation to bring it to pass

[33:05] different Baptist I'm a holy ghost

[33:21] kind of Baptist we ought to be have the
[33:22] Holy Holy Ghost amen I can see her

[33:27] telling everybody she's gonna have a
[33:29] baby knowing no man the angel told her
[33:32] about her cousin and right up she went
[33:34] to the hills of Judea she went to see
[33:36] her she couldn't stay any longer she
[33:38] heard good news isn't that right
[33:40] and I could see Mary coming and she ran
[33:43] out on Elizabeth was sitting knitting
[33:45] and threw her arms around Mary and bring
[33:47] it to hug her
[33:48] begin to what
[33:50] that they had a love for one another in
[33:52] them days we have lost that today you
[33:55] know it's the truth that's right people

[33:59] speak to them hardly unless you're up in
[34:02] some big rank like they are and when
[34:04] they go downtown and speak they just
[34:05] give some kind of silly grin oh brother
[34:07] I like that old-fashioned pump Handler
[34:09] and and Shake he got a pump handle
[34:11] handshake get right down to the bottom
[34:13] of it what are you anyhow praise God you
[34:16] don't even know your neighbor dead until
[34:17] you read any paper
[34:19] there's no love for people anymore you
[34:22] lost that this is very true you know
[34:24] this is very true you know a long time
[34:27] ago when we used a lot of money we go
[34:29] over to our neighbor and borrow fifty
[34:30] dollars to hold us over why we didn't
[34:32] have to sign any notes we trusted one
[34:34] another you can't borrow five dollars
[34:36] without a ten dollar security on top of
[34:38] it
[34:39] because the love shall Works cold
[34:41] because iniquity shall abund the love of
[34:44] many shall ask call and that's what the
[34:46] matter with the world they are dying for
[34:49] love we got plenty of teaching here we
[34:51] go here we go we got plenty of teaching
[34:53] plenty churches but what we need is the
[34:55] love of God and that's what's the matter
[34:58] with me today look I tell you brother he
[35:01] said I can see a happy rejoicing she run
[35:03] two arms around her I know how she was
[35:05] she have heard about it and I I could
[35:07] see put her arms around her and begin to
[35:09] love her and was hugging one another I
[35:11] like that I like to see women meet one
[35:13] another like that I like to see men grab
[35:15] a while ago a brother come out here hold
[35:17] my hand and put his arms around me a
[35:19] young fellow he said brother Branham I
[35:21] was in your meeting and my little girl
[35:23] was healed with something I forget it
[35:25] was you stood and said thus said the
[35:27] Lord that child would be a certain thing
[35:28] and it's just exactly like that and he
[35:31] put his arms around me I like that I am
[35:33] just an old-fashioned backwards
[35:35] sassafras preacher I like that I believe
[35:38] in the old-time sin
[35:40] religion they don't whitewash you it
[35:42] washes you white and makes you a new
[35:44] creature in Christ Jesus Oh Praise the
[35:47] Lord glory to God
[35:50] he said watch Billy Graham at meetings
[35:52] all over the country or about all the
[35:54] rest of them we have cried and prayed
[35:56] and prayed and everything else but you
[35:58] see the doors are closing so he's
[36:00] describing something here that that not
[36:02] happened just then but it's going to
[36:04] happen also in our time he said what you
[36:07] see the doors are closing let him that's
[36:09] filthy I'm caught in scripture be filthy
[36:11] still letting a righteous righteous
[36:13] still hear us holy holy still I believe
[36:15] the doors of the Gentile is closing
[36:18] together the days of the times of the
[36:20] season is just about over the reason you
[36:23] can't have no kind of meeting like that
[36:25] there is no travel of Soul you don't get
[36:28] that burden sometimes we talk about a
[36:30] soul and travail isn't that right praise
[36:32] God because things are slipping away the
[36:34] doors are kept getting going to be
[36:36] closed I remember years ago you always
[36:39] hear them talk about sawdust trails and
[36:40] things in the Tabernacle they didn't
[36:42] make it anymore not a bit more it was
[36:44] fresh God was calling his church I see
[36:47] them sob and cry lay on the altar all
[36:49] night long I went into their houses you
[36:51] could hear them when you come up in
[36:53] their bed team a man a woman crying oh
[36:54] God you could see them walk through the
[36:56] church I see the piano start playing
[36:58] Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross and tears
[37:00] flowing down there sniff sniff sniff
[37:02] walk into the church and walked onto
[37:04] another church and then precious
[37:06] Fountain oh God save my boy save my
[37:08] daughter she is lost please praise God
[37:11] we have parents with no burden we have
[37:13] fathers with no burden we have husbands
[37:15] with no burden we have wives with no
[37:17] burden we have mothers with no burden oh
[37:19] praise God praise God you've got to be a
[37:21] burden friends amen you do find that no
[37:23] more what's the matter what's the matter
[37:26] so when that burden is slipping away
[37:27] from people what's the matter the spirit
[37:29] of God is withdrawn and Jesus predicted
[37:32] this that the love of many their love
[37:35] would fail that's because iniquity would
[37:37] abound the love of many would fail and
[37:40] grow cold and go away the love is dying
[37:43] away who is talking about church folks
[37:44] who is talking about message people oh
[37:47] glory to God they have books their taste
[37:48] but where's the Love Oh Glory
[37:52] praise God they gotta form beat the
[37:55] piano up and down real hard yell glory
[37:57] to God hallelujah it's just a form don't
[38:00] fool yourself you're fooling yourself
[38:04] still reading
[38:06] Revelation 299 I Know Thy works
[38:08] hallelujah praise God you know praise
[38:12] God Revelation 2 and God was saying
[38:14] until Ephesus I write these things at
[38:17] Holy seven colon cancer I know that I
[38:19] worked and I labor and thy patience and
[38:22] how that kind of bear them are evil and
[38:24] always try them and say the apostles and
[38:26] a knot and from them Liars guys are well
[38:28] bold face courageous Believers you know
[38:30] and as born and as patience as for my
[38:33] name as labored and has not fainted
[38:35] there's a glorious testimony has a high
[38:37] recommendation nevertheless I have
[38:39] something against it
[38:41] because I was left I
[38:42] first love
[38:45] so God commend them for all the other
[38:48] attributes
[38:50] works and labor and patience and cast
[38:53] and evil you have righteous indignation
[38:58] and you're bossing a condemnation here
[38:59] and you're passing the condemnation here
[39:01] and you write something internet here
[39:03] and you blast that one here and you hit
[39:05] them hard here
[39:07] but no love
[39:10] no love you know but but that is message
[39:12] believer that is preacher I miss his
[39:14] master
[39:15] a message Minister zero love
[39:20] there's information and intellectual
[39:22] spewing out the mount
[39:26] here we find introductory marks I know
[39:28] that works the Son of God himself said
[39:30] believe me for the very work's sake he
[39:33] put an emphasis on his own Works while
[39:34] on Earth The Works that he did were
[39:36] ordained of God to inspire faith in him
[39:39] it was part of his ministry His Holy
[39:41] Spirit and the Apostle Paul said for we
[39:43] are his workmanship created in Christ
[39:45] Jesus unto good works so God had
[39:48] ordained that we should walk in them
[39:51] Ephesians praise God 220 these Works
[39:54] were to inspire faith in him and they
[39:57] would show forth that relationship to
[39:59] him that Paul preached created in him
[40:00] now works here we go will never take the
[40:04] place of faith in God for our salvation
[40:06] but works will show forth our faith
[40:09] already placed in him good works won't
[40:12] save you but they will Comfort out of a
[40:14] safe life as fruit unto the Lord I
[40:18] believe in good works even if a man is
[40:20] not safe he ought to do good works and
[40:22] do the best he can what is horribleness
[40:25] sight of God is a meant to do evil works
[40:27] and then say they are doing the will of
[40:29] God that is what the Bishops and popes
[40:31] and hierarchy of Rome were doing they
[40:34] were killing maimon the no man of evil
[40:36] in the name of the Lord they live out
[40:38] lives exactly opposite to what they
[40:40] would teach us in that evil day those
[40:43] True Believers Shone like a light in a
[40:45] dark place as they continually did good
[40:47] for the return cursing with blessing
[40:49] they did the truth to honor God even
[40:51] though many died with in this verse he
[40:54] commended his children because they were
[40:56] living change lives that is beautiful
[40:58] tonight they will live in what change
[41:01] lives their Works testified to our new
[41:05] spirit within men saw their good works
[41:08] and glorified God yes sir and if you are
[41:10] Christian you are going to do what is
[41:13] right your Works will show what your
[41:16] heart is right it won't be something
[41:18] that you put on but you will do his will
[41:20] when no one else but God sees you and
[41:23] you will do his will even cost you your
[41:25] life I know your love service Faith
[41:28] patience you know that the love is
[41:30] placed between works and service that is
[41:32] the right place for it because without
[41:34] love here we go
[41:35] our works are not accepted before God
[41:39] and neither is our service
[41:42] so doing things are more ritualistic or
[41:44] because you are instructed too or
[41:46] because you have an order too it doesn't
[41:48] cut it you know that is just following
[41:51] instructions and whatnot God wants us to
[41:53] operate with a level of love for him
[41:56] love isn't that right
[41:58] Hallelujah watch watch be without love
[42:05] our works are not accepted before God
[42:09] and neither is our service
[42:11] Paul speaking to the Corinthians said
[42:13] without love I am nothing and whatever I
[42:16] do without profit unless it is done in
[42:19] love
[42:19] now you can see right here that these
[42:22] Believers weren't in that nicolaitan
[42:24] class that did the works as mean of
[42:26] Salvation or to be admired by men they
[42:29] did the works out of the love of God
[42:31] that was shed in their hearts by the
[42:33] Holy Ghost the love in the hearts was
[42:35] God love for his own
[42:38] oh my God that is huge you hear that
[42:42] the love in the hearts was God's Own
[42:45] love for his own
[42:46] and then brother Abraham said Jesus said
[42:49] by this shall all men know that you're
[42:51] my disciples when you have love for one
[42:53] another
[42:54] so when God releases love that love is
[42:57] for his own so that love of God
[43:00] expresses it to the brethren
[43:02] Oh Glory to God this is a show tonight
[43:05] Oh Glory to God this is this is God's
[43:08] Own love that God given you to love your
[43:11] brother to love your sister to love your
[43:13] enemies to all glory to God to love
[43:15] others to love those who hate you okay
[43:18] the Lord some Praises not your love is
[43:20] God's love for God so loved the world he
[43:22] gave his only begotten son he asks them
[43:24] to love him back he loved he choose to
[43:26] love he choose to come and die he choose
[43:28] to come and pray and pay the price for
[43:30] us
[43:32] and because of that we should love him
[43:34] back
[43:35] and love his people is that right all
[43:38] right let's go by they shall all men
[43:41] know that you are my disciples that you
[43:42] have loved one for another the pagans
[43:44] who saw the lives of the early
[43:46] Christians said behold of the love for
[43:48] each other
[43:49] John said everyone that loveth is born
[43:51] of God
[43:52] everyone that love it is born
[43:55] of God what I want to give a warning
[43:58] right here it seems concerning the last
[44:01] days that because of abundant iniquity
[44:03] and iniquities when you know to write
[44:04] and do wrong you know better
[44:07] you could do better but you choose to
[44:09] continue in the world and the part that
[44:11] you're on I want to give a warning right
[44:12] here it says considering the last days
[44:14] that because in bonding iniquity the
[44:16] love of many will wax cold
[44:18] in the loudest you know last age here we
[44:21] go
[44:22] La audition last age
[44:24] self-love
[44:28] and love for material things will take
[44:31] the place of true love of God
[44:33] you can have one song The Greatest Love
[44:35] of All Is To Love Yourself
[44:42] music nice word something nice but
[44:44] that's what we're talking about here now
[44:46] self-love men shall be
[44:48] lovers of their own selves
[44:52] despise about those that are good
[44:55] human against Authority against parents
[44:57] heady and high-minded lovers of
[44:59] Pleasures more than
[45:01] lover of God that is church spirit in
[45:03] this message
[45:05] they believe
[45:07] but that's spirited upon them
[45:09] the love of
[45:13] Hallelujah
[45:14] all right let's continue
[45:17] self-love
[45:19] and love for material things not like
[45:22] for material things you know love it
[45:24] that's why they're going after it is a
[45:26] lust there's a greed there's a passion
[45:29] for material things we'll take the place
[45:32] of the true love of God we need to guard
[45:35] against the power of sin in these last
[45:37] days
[45:38] writing that influences no that post
[45:40] wasn't existing 10 20 years ago

[46:03] his word to bring you under influence
[46:05] too which is the influence of the word
[46:07] the devil trying to bring his influence
[46:09] and God trying to bring his influence
[46:10] hallelujah praise God this is the
[46:13] influence you tonight you know that's
[46:15] where this would come in for tonight you
[46:17] know to influence you to love him to
[46:19] serve him to worship him to acknowledge
[46:21] Him and stop just doing things as a
[46:23] ritualistic thing
[46:27] watch
[46:30] so many
[46:32] are getting so hard
[46:34] because
[46:36] they haven't realized the effect of this
[46:39] last this spirit
[46:42] is the last day spirit
[46:45] it is time to draw night to God
[46:48] and let him fill our lives with his love
[46:50] or we will feel the coldness of the last
[46:55] day Church
[46:56] and reject the truth of God which alone
[47:00] is able to help us
[47:02] see the spirit atmosphere
[47:04] that brings this anointing of debt
[47:07] upon the people that there is no
[47:09] atmosphere there is no real worship they
[47:11] believe they believe in me the devil
[47:13] leave and tremble but there's no real
[47:15] atmosphere they're not even trying to
[47:17] create it because you can as a Son of
[47:19] God you can create an atmosphere by your
[47:22] life by your testifying by your Witness
[47:24] by your Praises by your expression your
[47:27] love for God you could show God they say
[47:30] but I'm saying how do we show our love
[47:32] for God by conducting ourselves with joy
[47:35] and Mr trials he in his wisdom sends our
[47:39] way that's how you show your love for

[48:36] and Dreadful years the True Vine held
[48:39] its love for God and love of the
[48:42] Brethren God commended them for it I
[48:45] know your service Jesus said he that is
[48:47] great as of all is servant to all a wise
[48:50] man commented on that saying only
[48:52] history will prove the truth of this
[48:54] that victim that man was right all the
[48:58] truly great men of history have been
[49:00] servants
[49:02] they who demanded to be served they who
[49:05] oppressed they who sought to always be
[49:08] at the head have gone wrong in shame
[49:10] even the very rich are condemned by God
[49:13] when they have not used their wealth
[49:14] right but look in the history and you
[49:17] will find that the truly great with
[49:19] those who serve others history can never
[49:21] Acclaim those for whom much was done it
[49:24] will forever praise those who did much
[49:26] for others oh give the Lord some Praises
[49:29] your labor Brethren is not in vain your
[49:32] servant is not in vain Oh Glory to God
[49:35] your support for the Saints is not in
[49:37] vain or given praise tonight now let us
[49:39] apply that to ourselves even the son of
[49:42] man came not to be ministered unto but
[49:44] to minister so we have to follow that
[49:46] example see him as he pulls himself over
[49:49] the feet of the Apostles and washes
[49:51] their Tire to defeat you know what I'm
[49:53] doing but you will know Hereafter and
[49:55] what you see me doing you ought to also
[49:57] to do he became a servant in order that
[50:01] God could Elevate him to the highest
[50:03] Heights and one day in the Judgment of
[50:05] the Saints we are going to hear him say
[50:06] Well done good and faithful servant
[50:09] enter into the joy of the Lord not well
[50:12] done great great and powerful boss and
[50:15] dictator or Pope message Pope or Man In
[50:18] Charge or man of the hour that's not
[50:19] what you're going to say Well done my
[50:21] good and faithful servant servant is the
[50:23] one who carried the dishes I will plates
[50:25] carry the amen the silverers Hallelujah
[50:29] the greatest call that God can give you
[50:31] is the service people and to serve him
[50:33] and to save others oh give the Lord some
[50:35] Praises tonight Hallelujah glory to God
[50:38] well done my good and faithful servant
[50:40] and into the joy of the Lord it is hard
[50:43] to be always a silvered but those who
[50:45] spend and are spent for others will one
[50:47] day be seasoned with him in his throne
[50:49] it will be worth it all then let us
[50:51] leave it for the master from the taunted
[50:53] Southern Sun let us talk of all his
[50:55] wondrous love and care and when all of
[50:57] life is over and our work on Earth is
[50:59] done and the role is Called Up Yonder
[51:01] I'll be be there we'll give the Lord
[51:03] some Praises hallelujah hallelujah
[51:06] hallelujah glory amen amen
[51:10] Let's go people who give the people
[51:14] thinking that they will get rewarded for
[51:16] it wealth they don't have any reward
[51:20] you see the balance coming now
[51:22] people doing things with an agenda
[51:25] message politicians everything they do
[51:28] is have an agenda behind it has some
[51:30] hidden motive as I appreciate about the
[51:32] motive of the heart the heart is right
[51:35] remember the time I had a vision of some
[51:37] oil somewhere and then Brothers come and
[51:40] say oh tell us where it is if we if we
[51:43] tell us we take the money and do it for
[51:45] the kingdom of God and everything else
[51:53] instead of using money for themselves
[51:55] and guess what they only had a trickle
[51:57] somebody is getting main vein and they
[52:00] get exposed the heart wasn't right
[52:05] so that's for the prophets that your
[52:06] motive and your objective must be right
[52:08] for it to happen yes and we talk about
[52:11] getting down to the turtle that is
[52:12] sacred that's not a gamble that's not a
[52:15] flick of the hand the third pull pull
[52:17] speak the word speak what word
[52:23] speak which word
[52:27] that's the kind of man that's a local
[52:28] Manchester United I don't speak English
[52:29] word you know trying to like to talk
[52:31] plenty speak what word
[52:34] that might have to be feeling God
[52:36] that might have to be proof of God that
[52:38] way Jesus said a man Peter said a man of
[52:40] proof of God among you
[52:47] this is not Legend
[52:49] these are different faces different
[52:51] parts
[52:52] but when it comes down to be more
[52:54] sincere
[52:55] when it comes down to you have been
[52:58] given power to bind the mama but be more
[53:00] sincere the sneaker by you but they
[53:02] could bite your brother and you had to
[53:05] be sincere to deal with the snake to
[53:06] protect your brother
[53:08] Oh Glory to God I ain't talking about
[53:10] you because you you're my servant the
[53:12] purpose I raised you for is to make sure
[53:14] there's a bride for Jesus Christ
[53:16] Oh Glory to God and as myself and I've
[53:19] seen something deeper inside of you that
[53:21] need to get corrected okay only God
[53:23] could do that you know every Monday day
[53:25] nobody can tell them nothing nobody can
[53:27] talk to them they hire Almighty they're
[53:29] like like you said only children already
[53:31] discipline
[53:37] who play God
[53:40] people who give to people
[53:43] thinking that they get a reward for it
[53:45] well they don't have any reward
[53:48] it is those who give freely
[53:51] from the bottom of their heart
[53:54] not the top of your head
[53:56] the bottom of your heart that says I
[53:58] just give it freely not that I expect
[54:00] anything in return
[54:02] what did Jesus told disciples freely
[54:04] received freely give
[54:13] you know
[54:14] because because they don't give God no
[54:16] if he give them it will stop right there
[54:19] but he wants a channel that when he give
[54:21] he could just go out and as it go out he
[54:23] gave you more take a walk more go out
[54:25] more gold oh give the Lord some praises
[54:29] Jesus said the Gentiles or unbelievers
[54:31] do such as that they give when they're
[54:33] expected to be given back but the
[54:35] children of God give when we don't want
[54:37] any return we just give it oh blessed be
[54:40] the name of the Lord O glory to God
[54:43] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[54:46] God I talk about the sunlight woman and
[54:49] Elijah and was showing her kindness and
[54:51] how they put a little room for Elijah as
[54:53] a servant of God and one day he passed
[54:56] by and it came to pass when Elisha was
[54:58] coming he stopped by he found a little
[55:00] place of course he was very happy to
[55:02] find that people loved him and that
[55:04] baram said these words now everybody
[55:06] wants to be loved I tell you the truth I
[55:09] do
[55:10] I want God to love me and I want people
[55:13] to love me that's exactly the truth and
[55:16] if God loves me then the people would
[55:18] love me
[55:19] and if I love his people then he will
[55:22] love me for doing it
[55:25] God are you ready tonight God would
[55:29] rather I love you than love him
[55:33] when I say hear that one there's a bum
[55:34] you know
[55:43] foreign
[55:50] they scatter because they not line up
[55:52] with this
[55:53] because we could ask where is the love
[55:54] you're crossing the streets where is it
[55:57] love Yeah I want to shake my hand
[55:58] where's the love
[56:00] listen to this part now if God loves me
[56:03] then the people would love me and if I
[56:06] love his people then he would love me
[56:09] for doing it God would rather I love you
[56:13] than love him did you know that
[56:16] I would rather you love my boy back
[56:18] there no matter what you say about me I
[56:20] want you to love my children any father
[56:23] would think that so father God thinks
[56:25] the same thing for he said in so much so
[56:29] you see of a scripture for this and I
[56:30] love that you know he's just saying that
[56:31] stop here yes in so much you have done
[56:34] unto the least of these my little ones
[56:36] you did it unto me
[56:38] so if you want to love God just start
[56:41] loving all of his children
[56:46] you better get your fight with yourself
[56:48] something wrong with you with that fight
[56:50] Hallelujah you have to start to love
[56:52] God's children and they change something
[56:54] inside of you see and God will reward
[56:56] you and you will love his children that
[56:59] shows the love of God is in you now
[57:01] Jesus said this is the way that all
[57:02] people know that you are children of God
[57:05] and pass on death on the life that you
[57:07] have love for one another then you know
[57:08] it not because you can have a big church
[57:11] now
[57:14] but apparently saying this not because
[57:17] you have a big church that's all right
[57:19] not because you have a lot of fine
[57:21] ministers come by
[57:23] it's good too but it's because you have
[57:26] love one for another
[57:29] and then Bob said this when this revival
[57:31] is over you all go back to your
[57:33] respective churches we are not here to
[57:35] cross the light until you leave one
[57:37] church and go to another
[57:38] keep your church try to bring some
[57:39] Sinners into that church then when you
[57:41] go back to your respective Church go
[57:43] back with such a Heart full of love that
[57:46] woman that you just couldn't stand or
[57:48] that man love him or who anyhow they
[57:51] will know you got something out of the
[57:53] meeting
[57:54] if you don't do that you haven't gained
[57:56] anything yet because you've got to have
[57:59] love one for another the outside world
[58:01] will know that your past from getting to
[58:04] life when you have loved one for another
[58:06] isn't that powerful because we give the
[58:08] Lord a hand a praise
[58:10] praise be to Jesus
[58:12] Hallelujah for the brand name
[58:15] so he's got other men on the field Great
[58:17] Men I'm one of the small but my little
[58:19] part I'd like to do for him to show him
[58:22] my expression about my love for him to
[58:24] be reverent I love him with all my heart
[58:26] and I cannot love him without loving you
[58:29] all
[58:30] for he rather is the next quote for he
[58:33] rather I love you all than love him I'd
[58:36] rather love you you love my children
[58:37] instead of loving me and me being a
[58:39] parent think so what about him oh praise
[58:41] God and I believe the reason we don't
[58:45] have desperation is because of lack of
[58:47] love
[58:49] God the love of God I think that the
[58:52] love of God causes desperation
[58:55] if God is in you the token inside of you
[58:57] and you see the conditions of times and
[58:59] people waiting and sin the way they are
[59:01] it will tune to desperation I believe it
[59:03] will what if God could do something for
[59:06] this church for for people that come
[59:08] here and get him in that channel of
[59:10] desperation
[59:11] all right go by the love of God watch
[59:13] this
[59:15] now I like how he you see the Prophet
[59:18] come to reveal the scriptures
[59:20] so whatever he is presenting is in the
[59:23] word
[59:23] because a prophet can't go outside the
[59:25] word has to be in the word so he's going
[59:27] here now watch if God is in you the
[59:31] token is inside of you and you see the
[59:33] condition of times and people waiting on
[59:35] the sin that they are it will throw you
[59:37] into desperation I believe it will now
[59:40] the word plainly states if you want to
[59:42] put it down Galatians 5 6 faith Wicked
[59:46] by love
[59:47] Faith Wicked by love and the only way
[59:50] you can have faith is to have love Feast
[59:52] because after all faith is love
[59:54] incentive that's what faith is it's an
[59:57] incentive to love if you don't have love
[59:59] you can't have faith
[1:00:01] so when we talk about he shall turn the
[1:00:03] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:00:06] of the fathers he's also connecting it
[1:00:09] with the l-o-v-e
[1:00:11] and look what love is right on top of
[1:00:13] the pyramid and to get the l-o-v-e you
[1:00:16] have to pass your brotherly love
[1:00:19] so the virtues are correctly because why
[1:00:21] God didn't put God in his hand up there
[1:00:24] and then put l-o-v-e
[1:00:27] he put godliness to be like God but the
[1:00:29] channel to love is still brotherly
[1:00:31] kindness he put the deer and said this
[1:00:34] is the blood that has to be displayed
[1:00:36] for this age and the Bride of this age
[1:00:38] will have the blood of this age
[1:00:40] displayed upon her chest or give the
[1:00:42] Lord Praises tonight
[1:00:44] Hallelujah
[1:00:46] if you don't have love you cannot have
[1:00:48] faith so faith that works by love
[1:00:52] and that's why Jesus said when you stand
[1:00:54] praying
[1:00:55] forgive if you are awed against any
[1:00:57] because you cannot have that ought on
[1:01:00] something and look to get from God
[1:01:01] something will hold you back you
[1:01:04] wouldn't have that Faith to even speak
[1:01:05] the word because something will hinder
[1:01:07] you you don't understand your enemies as
[1:01:09] part of the package
[1:01:10] things are challenging right now as part
[1:01:12] of the package your home scenario is
[1:01:15] part of the packet
[1:01:16] it is not there getting tested you get
[1:01:18] in tests
[1:01:19] it's not their failure it's your failure
[1:01:21] it's our failure God is Not testing them
[1:01:24] God testing you he's not testing your
[1:01:26] enemies testing you he's not testing the
[1:01:28] other brother he's testing you
[1:01:30] you get in fight but you're getting
[1:01:32] tested
[1:01:38] how can your faith in your life if you
[1:01:40] don't love her
[1:01:44] how can I be if you don't love God
[1:01:47] if you said you love your wife and never
[1:01:49] tell her about it
[1:01:51] shall I read your mind then
[1:01:55] you love your wife
[1:01:57] no card no flower no chocolate no
[1:02:00] nothing
[1:02:02] but she had a mind readers love she had
[1:02:04] to get vibes
[1:02:07] if you love your wife and never tell her
[1:02:09] about it never said Don't Make Love to
[1:02:11] express it a kisser hugger tell her
[1:02:14] she's the best cook in the country all
[1:02:16] the things that you know how pretty she
[1:02:17] is how much I love her if you don't do
[1:02:19] that she will never know it
[1:02:22] that's the way if you do love her you
[1:02:24] express it
[1:02:25] that's the only way
[1:02:27] what do we make my do I make any food
[1:02:30] and making my food there foreign
[1:02:34] just mechanics
[1:02:36] no Dynamics with that
[1:02:40] just letter no inspiration with that
[1:02:43] that's not how the wife's supposed to be
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:46] you know what I mean if you are any
[1:02:48] cruising oh God
[1:02:49] you should I eat like this I don't think
[1:02:52] no no who likes Anna
[1:02:57] from
[1:03:01] but I know there's a glorious Church
[1:03:03] Without spot a wrinkle and it and if
[1:03:05] that wrinkle ever come out God either
[1:03:06] put some heat out
[1:03:10] all our wrinkle inside our lives go
[1:03:11] ahead God have our iron too you know so
[1:03:14] just in case you're missing the iron
[1:03:15] home when they come to church whatever I
[1:03:17] am here too you know to get the wrinkles
[1:03:19] out with our wrinkles
[1:03:29] oh give the Lord some praises
[1:03:32] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so
[1:03:36] you have to express it and that's the
[1:03:38] way we do to God when we love him we
[1:03:41] tell him about it
[1:03:43] and that was amazing the full song by
[1:03:45] Anthony sang today tonight hallelujah
[1:03:48] praise God what's amazing to me
[1:03:50] that's the way we do to God when we love
[1:03:52] him we tell him about it we sit down we
[1:03:55] adore him and worship him and and love
[1:03:58] drives us to that so he don't go to God
[1:04:00] every time you're going to go to God
[1:04:01] give me give me give me give me give me
[1:04:02] give me
[1:04:07] not a worshiper he's not expressing love
[1:04:10] for me praise God praise God hold
[1:04:12] yourself Who Art in Heaven
[1:04:15] Hallowed be thy name
[1:04:17] worship thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:04:19] done there's no petition here there's no
[1:04:21] asking yet you have to go down down and
[1:04:24] say give us this day our daily bread
[1:04:25] before all of that Hallowed be thy name
[1:04:27] you have to be worshiping thanking God
[1:04:29] before that woman got her daughter
[1:04:30] delivered she came and worshiped she
[1:04:32] gave God praise she was thanking God
[1:04:34] because you know Jesus was the answer to
[1:04:36] her problem Oh Glory to God Jesus said
[1:04:38] he's not fit to take the children bread
[1:04:39] and give it a dog but she's in an
[1:04:41] atmosphere she come for a breakthrough
[1:04:43] she come and be half her daughter she
[1:04:45] come with a burden their parents without
[1:04:47] burden but this woman had a burden of
[1:04:49] her daughter her daughter clueless his
[1:04:51] Devil's upon the daughter back home but
[1:04:53] she stood out wrong Oh Glory to God it's
[1:04:55] not fit to take the children better give
[1:04:57] it at all just give it a dog she said
[1:04:59] but even blood even the dogs take crumbs
[1:05:01] one of the master table he said for this
[1:05:03] scene your daughter is made whole okay
[1:05:05] the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah
[1:05:07] pray ordinary woman she had no baptized
[1:05:10] Believers wearing long dress ordinary
[1:05:12] woman but she had a daughter with a
[1:05:13] devil inside a deal in a house but she
[1:05:16] had Faith to come before Son of God and
[1:05:18] to stay right there and Lord God throw
[1:05:20] off with nothing
[1:05:26] are you ready
[1:05:28] let's press on if Pentecost was God's
[1:05:31] Vine which was the new Vine that grew up
[1:05:33] then these four destroyers talking about
[1:05:36] Cancun caterpillar eat the vine down now
[1:05:39] let's find out what Pentecost had
[1:05:41] find out what we got lacking and then we
[1:05:44] ought to find out what the Destroyer are
[1:05:46] and who they are and what it is now the
[1:05:49] first thing that Pentecost produces
[1:05:51] broadly love
[1:05:53] I didn't see it
[1:05:56] I didn't say it
[1:05:58] the first thing was what
[1:06:00] body love it tore down the middle wall
[1:06:03] of partitions and made a Brotherhood
[1:06:06] there's such a way they had everything
[1:06:09] in common in the Bible
[1:06:14] it make a Brotherhood Paul spoke of this
[1:06:16] Brotherhood he gave all the gifts of the
[1:06:18] Pentecostal church and then said in
[1:06:19] First Corinthians 13 do I speak with
[1:06:21] tongues of men and angels have not this
[1:06:23] love which brings the Brotherhood
[1:06:25] I am nothing
[1:06:27] not just love abstract
[1:06:30] this here defines it the love that
[1:06:33] brings Brotherhood
[1:06:35] I am nothing and though I have the
[1:06:37] knowledge to understand all mysteries of
[1:06:39] God I am still nothing without love the
[1:06:41] love of the brethren
[1:06:43] so see how this is revealing here this
[1:06:46] is the prophet revealing the love that
[1:06:48] Paul was talking a First Corinthian to
[1:06:49] team
[1:06:53] I am still nothing without love the love
[1:06:56] of the Brethren and Jesus said this
[1:07:00] shall all men know that you're my
[1:07:01] disciples when you have loved one for
[1:07:02] another Pentecost had that and speaking
[1:07:05] Pentecost meaning the first group of the
[1:07:07] Apostles and disciples they had that
[1:07:09] broadly love they wasn't greedy
[1:07:12] they sold everything they had for the
[1:07:14] furthering of the church they were
[1:07:16] sought together even when one heard the
[1:07:19] other died they said let us go and die
[1:07:20] with him
[1:07:22] such a Feeling
[1:07:24] and Jesus spoke of this and Paul did
[1:07:27] rather said let brain love continue
[1:07:29] that was in the first church
[1:07:32] but something taking place there's a
[1:07:34] fellow come by the name of the Palmer
[1:07:36] room and when he began to eat on that
[1:07:38] vine of brainly love he caught the very
[1:07:40] sap line of it because they don't make
[1:07:43] any difference how smart we are how much
[1:07:45] we think we know how much we want to be
[1:07:47] different from somebody else as long as
[1:07:50] that brotherly feeling isn't among us we
[1:07:53] are fighting a losing battle
[1:07:57] oh
[1:07:58] his bum is falling tonight you know
[1:08:00] this is
[1:08:02] another bomb that's right we can't win
[1:08:06] there is no way for us to win
[1:08:10] people want to win how join the sword
[1:08:12] sword fight
[1:08:14] ing your brother because
[1:08:20] Jesus had a put and healed back the
[1:08:21] money is you know I said Peter they're
[1:08:23] not even the fighter
[1:08:24] that same pizza with fight Tiffany Lord
[1:08:26] you go on the night guys three times
[1:08:27] after that
[1:08:30] because he loves short and he have fear
[1:08:32] but probably
[1:08:33] fighting he didn't want no crucify him
[1:08:37] yeah
[1:08:40] Jesus getting beaten he don't want that
[1:08:43] I I don't know I wasn't that night at
[1:08:45] all
[1:08:49] let me read this again
[1:08:51] it don't make any difference how smart
[1:08:53] we are how much we think we know how
[1:08:56] much we want to be different from
[1:08:57] somebody else as long as that brotherly
[1:09:00] feeling isn't among us we are fighting a
[1:09:03] losing battle that's right we can't win
[1:09:05] there's no way for us to win
[1:09:08] all right any home stretch we along with
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:11] there's so much in the day we live in
[1:09:13] potential gifts
[1:09:14] so many people judge people buying gifts
[1:09:18] that they have
[1:09:19] this brother have a good preaching a
[1:09:21] good teaching gift a good pastor give a
[1:09:22] good speaking don't get whatever I give
[1:09:24] well I believe that all these things are
[1:09:26] gifts I believe that we are see take
[1:09:27] place as gifts they are god-given gifts
[1:09:30] but if we don't use them in the right
[1:09:33] way that God intended them to be used as
[1:09:36] by the Andrew for long preached about
[1:09:37] purpose the purpose why God gave a man a
[1:09:40] gift
[1:09:43] but we're doing the right way that God
[1:09:45] intended to use then we can do more harm
[1:09:47] with the gifts than we could if we did
[1:09:49] not have the gifts
[1:09:50] the other night I made a statement at
[1:09:52] the pulpit saying this I would rather
[1:09:55] see broadly love existing among the
[1:09:57] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:10:00] healing or anything else
[1:10:01] we must know what these things are for
[1:10:05] eign
[1:10:17] what purpose he has if he's trying to
[1:10:20] take his influence and build himself a
[1:10:22] great name out of it I'll have the
[1:10:23] assignment of spirit enough to know
[1:10:25] that's wrong
[1:10:26] no matter how great the teachings is
[1:10:28] no matter how great the teacher is how
[1:10:31] powerful he is how intellectual he is
[1:10:33] how his gift operates it if here we go
[1:10:37] if he isn't trying to achieve something
[1:10:39] for the benefit of the body of Christ
[1:10:41] your own spiritual discernment will tell
[1:10:43] you that's wrong
[1:10:44] no matter how accurate how perfect how
[1:10:48] it is it is wrong if it isn't used for
[1:10:52] the body of Christ
[1:10:53] dutchieve something maybe he's got a
[1:10:55] great gift that he could draw people
[1:10:56] together with great intellectual or
[1:10:58] spiritual power he could draw people
[1:11:00] together and maybe he's trying to take
[1:11:01] that gift and make himself famous so you
[1:11:03] have a big name so other president will
[1:11:05] look up to him as a big person that's
[1:11:07] wrong maybe he's trying to edify a
[1:11:10] certain thing that he wants somebody
[1:11:11] else to get out of the picture and let
[1:11:13] him and his group be in the picture
[1:11:15] belittle the next group smoothly fire
[1:11:17] next another word smallify our next
[1:11:19] Minister pastor and so like that and
[1:11:21] bring his group and he sent a pokus
[1:11:25] foreign
[1:11:42] foreign
[1:11:55] what did you say
[1:11:58] who he foreign
[1:12:11] is
[1:12:17] all right watch something now
[1:12:19] if he has a gift of God and he's trying
[1:12:23] to edify the body of Christ then I don't
[1:12:25] care what he belongs to you are not
[1:12:29] Discerning the man you're resiling the
[1:12:31] spirit the life that's in the man and
[1:12:34] that is what God told us to do not one
[1:12:37] time have we ever been commissioned to
[1:12:39] resume the man's group but we are
[1:12:40] constrained and commanded by God that is
[1:12:43] in the spirit and the man what he's
[1:12:44] trying to do what this person's life is
[1:12:47] trying to lead up to and then if we find
[1:12:49] out he's trying to lead the people not
[1:12:51] to bring them up but to bring them
[1:12:53] together to bring the Church of the
[1:12:55] Living God not to all want the
[1:12:56] nomination but to an understanding of
[1:12:59] Fellowship a Unity of spirit we will
[1:13:01] never be one denomination one
[1:13:03] organization one people praise God like
[1:13:05] I don't know what Unity there will be no
[1:13:07] Unity
[1:13:08] until we get to the feet God is all
[1:13:10] about Unity you know it's Unity of
[1:13:12] defeat so to get Unity yeah they get to
[1:13:15] defeat first
[1:13:16] then if you have the faith and I have
[1:13:18] the faith then we can unite because we
[1:13:19] are united by the faith which hate not
[1:13:22] any faith there's only one Faith you
[1:13:24] have to find out whether One Faith is
[1:13:25] that's the faith that was once delivered
[1:13:27] to the Saints and that is why God said
[1:13:29] Malachi for William Marion Branham to
[1:13:31] get us back to the fate and that faith
[1:13:33] has worked by love or or say this way
[1:13:35] that faith is what my charity or I say
[1:13:38] this way that faith has worked by
[1:13:39] Dynamics
[1:13:41] oh give the Lord some praises
[1:13:44] Glory
[1:13:46] so it's not just faith I believe I'm
[1:13:47] fake I'm a hearing I hear him by the
[1:13:49] word of God yeah that's a certain kind
[1:13:50] of Faith but Anthony we're talking about
[1:13:52] we don't want to say that what's my love
[1:13:53] and love is at the top
[1:13:55] love is the rest love is what we
[1:13:58] striving for that's why we have faith
[1:14:00] and root your knowledge you're claiming
[1:14:01] to get the charity because you have to
[1:14:04] have a charity anointed faith
[1:14:06] Oh Glory the god of Faith Anointed with
[1:14:09] the love of God oh Hallelujah that Faith
[1:14:12] Can fail
[1:14:14] reach out into places
[1:14:16] Oh Glory to God Amen so watch
[1:14:20] this now now if we find out that he's
[1:14:23] trying to lead the people not bring them
[1:14:24] up but to bring them together to bring
[1:14:26] them to bring the Church of the Living
[1:14:28] God not to one day nomination but on
[1:14:31] understanding of Fellowship a Unity of
[1:14:34] spirit then if he's for marine laterine
[1:14:37] whatever it is his spirit and his
[1:14:38] purpose is right his spirit
[1:14:41] and his purpose is right you know but he
[1:14:44] said Daddy I hope you don't want to say
[1:14:46] you never hear the man preaching up
[1:14:47] about Andrew for longer I said I said I
[1:14:49] have no intention to do that I did it
[1:14:50] before but Norris I said no I have no
[1:14:52] intention to that I was telling brother
[1:14:54] Angela after his service but he come and
[1:14:56] saved himself he said but over there and
[1:14:57] preached that is true all I know he has
[1:14:59] a fine spirit is a humble brother he's
[1:15:01] very respectful he's very humble and
[1:15:03] something like that and and I just felt
[1:15:05] led to do what I did and I would always
[1:15:07] go oh I feel led I don't go by intellect
[1:15:09] or politics I know one thing I'm not a
[1:15:12] non-application I'm not doing things to
[1:15:14] please anybody I'm trying to do things
[1:15:16] to please God and as as the Bible says
[1:15:19] as men are led by the spirit of God they
[1:15:21] are the sons of God Hallelujah and God
[1:15:23] did not disappoint Oh Glory to God God
[1:15:26] did not disappoint
[1:15:27] could we give a shouting that God did
[1:15:30] not disappoint Oh Glory to God
[1:15:33] hallelujah praise God Amen all right so
[1:15:37] watch and the spirit in him no matter
[1:15:41] what movie belonged to the spirit that's
[1:15:43] in him is trying to point the people to
[1:15:44] Calvary away from himself away from
[1:15:46] anything else his only achievement is to
[1:15:48] point them to Calvary he doesn't care
[1:15:50] whether he's even known or not he
[1:15:52] doesn't care whether even his own
[1:15:53] movement which is fine if it's good
[1:15:55] whether it doesn't care oh praise God
[1:15:58] and he said I rather have a church
[1:16:00] listen a moment I would rather have a
[1:16:03] church that knows nothing about any
[1:16:05] spiritual gift
[1:16:06] just be so in love with each other and
[1:16:09] with Christ I rather have that than
[1:16:11] every spiritual gift operating in the
[1:16:13] church so that might sound hard in a
[1:16:16] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:16:18] have it wherever his gifts they'll feel
[1:16:20] whatever his gifts they'll bring
[1:16:22] confusion whatever is give it can be
[1:16:25] questioned but where there is love it's
[1:16:28] perfect
[1:16:29] if you are perfect love you have perfect
[1:16:31] gifts
[1:16:32] so work first with love
[1:16:35] that brings Fellowship
[1:16:38] and fellowship brings gifts could we
[1:16:40] give the Lord some praises
[1:16:44] I'm almost done
[1:16:47] this one is a powerful one but from
[1:16:50] India share this with me how did Stephen
[1:16:52] do it he never performed any miracles
[1:16:54] although he knowed that Christ was a
[1:16:58] miracle performer he knowed all these
[1:17:00] powers and things but what did he do he
[1:17:02] just presented his life in such a way
[1:17:05] that they've seen it was the power of
[1:17:07] Christ amen you may never see a vision
[1:17:10] you may never put your hands on a sick
[1:17:12] person and feel the charge of almighty
[1:17:14] God make a skeleton of a man turn back
[1:17:16] to life again
[1:17:17] you may never see him standing under in
[1:17:20] three or four rainbows you may never see
[1:17:22] his image you may never hear his voice
[1:17:25] but still you can be a sign board that
[1:17:28] will reflect Jesus Christ
[1:17:30] by a life that is so pure and
[1:17:33] unadulterated from the world not plotted
[1:17:35] up with dirty things around your life
[1:17:37] but appeal thing it will cause the
[1:17:39] Hungry Heart the hunger and choose to be
[1:17:42] like you
[1:17:42] that's what my message let your light so
[1:17:44] shine me for men
[1:17:46] and I'm gonna close in here I want to
[1:17:48] wrap up here
[1:17:49] with the next script to be read and
[1:17:51] Jacob serves seven years for racial
[1:17:54] and the seem unto him but a few days
[1:17:58] for the love he had
[1:18:00] for her
[1:18:02] the love of Jacob farisha
[1:18:05] and this to me is a powerful thing
[1:18:07] listen it's seven years
[1:18:11] and even after that seven years the man
[1:18:13] gave him the other sister and he had to
[1:18:16] put on the next 10 years
[1:18:18] but the Bible said that the years was
[1:18:21] like these
[1:18:22] because of the love
[1:18:24] oh Hallelujah could we give the Lord our
[1:18:27] prayers on that one
[1:18:33] he used to talk about a man
[1:18:35] if lover girl quite every talk or
[1:18:37] whatever it is and whatnot and he will
[1:18:40] ride bike it doesn't matter how he ain't
[1:18:42] no way coming back
[1:18:43] but you're going because you're in love
[1:18:45] oh praise the name of the Lord remember
[1:18:47] what I'm always talking about that
[1:18:48] Hallelujah
[1:18:50] praise God and brother Branham the
[1:18:53] church is United under one God by one
[1:18:55] Spirit the spirit of God in one whole
[1:18:57] Union of God to be one holy bride of God
[1:18:59] that's right for the uniting time of the
[1:19:01] Bride the church is so coming together
[1:19:04] it should create
[1:19:07] such a love Among Us that we could
[1:19:10] hardly be away from one another
[1:19:12] you don't have to beg people to pray you
[1:19:15] don't have to beg them to worship God
[1:19:16] you don't have to beg them to do what is
[1:19:18] right they're just so in love with him
[1:19:20] till there is nothing else oh give the
[1:19:22] Lord some Praises tonight no begging
[1:19:25] nothing praise God so if this is not in
[1:19:28] the church this is not if there's not
[1:19:29] coming to church they're coming alone
[1:19:31] way off you know because if you're
[1:19:32] coming and the United this has to be in
[1:19:34] effect
[1:19:35] no no just talk talk mystery talk love
[1:19:37] have to be created love have to be an
[1:19:40] atmosphere to be dear he said one day
[1:19:42] we'll be standing talking and love will
[1:19:44] just drop down among the people and all
[1:19:46] that will be wrong will be made right
[1:19:48] all he will be taken out it'll be such a
[1:19:50] Unity Oh Glory that God will be standing
[1:19:53] talking or glory to God may be talking
[1:19:56] my direct inspiration Lord Give the Lord
[1:19:58] a shout tonight
[1:19:59] this one word reading again musician
[1:20:02] come on please for the United time of
[1:20:04] the Bride the church is so coming
[1:20:06] together it should create such a love
[1:20:08] Among Us now we could hardly be away
[1:20:10] from one another you don't have to beg
[1:20:11] the people to pray you don't have to beg
[1:20:13] them to worship God you have to beg them
[1:20:16] to do what is right they're just so in
[1:20:18] love
[1:20:23] but I'm continuing what do you think
[1:20:25] about a girl a little pretty little Maid
[1:20:26] that's going to marry some handsome
[1:20:27] young man that she's so mad in love with
[1:20:29] it means mortar than her own life she
[1:20:31] knows right away that they will get
[1:20:33] married as the wedding day approaches my
[1:20:35] little fellow I'm telling you she's
[1:20:36] walking around she just makes herself
[1:20:38] ready she's surrender is completely to
[1:20:39] him everything that pleases him just
[1:20:42] what she wants to do and that's the way
[1:20:44] the church today our lives should be so
[1:20:46] hidden God in Christ sealed there by the
[1:20:48] Holy Spirit
[1:20:54] Psalms 122 1. I was glad when they said
[1:20:57] unto me
[1:21:03] let us go
[1:21:04] into the house of the Lord
[1:21:07] why David has a love for God
[1:21:10] so when the invite come he was joyful to
[1:21:12] go
[1:21:14] so when you find it hard to worship
[1:21:16] lack of love
[1:21:18] hard to serve God lack of love hard to
[1:21:21] pay tights hard to serve hard to give
[1:21:25] hard to love a lack of love
[1:21:28] but when you love like Jacob
[1:21:31] seven years
[1:21:32] is a few days
[1:21:34] it is no strain when you are in love
[1:21:38] no strain to press no shame to endure no
[1:21:42] strain to take the pressure but I am
[1:21:44] feeling the anointing but why do we love
[1:21:46] our God
[1:21:48] we want to feel
[1:21:50] and he give you his word
[1:21:55] Galatians 5 6. begin to play something
[1:21:59] for in Jesus Christ need a circumcision
[1:22:01] available at anything no uncircumcision
[1:22:04] but faith which Wicked by love there's
[1:22:08] going to be a charity anointed for in
[1:22:10] Friends
[1:22:10] Dynamics upon the feet that Malachi 4
[1:22:13] restored
[1:22:14] intellectual fate and that's what they
[1:22:17] have the majority of right now cannot
[1:22:19] really connect a charity
