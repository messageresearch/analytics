[28:25] despite the weather you still made it
[28:27] out we are happy for you to be here
[28:29] we are glad to be back in church amen
[28:34] reading from said mark
[28:39] 16 verse nine now when jesus was written
[28:41] early
[28:42] the first day of the week he appeared
[28:44] first of mary magdalene
[28:45] out of whom he had cast seven devils
[28:49] and she went and told them that had been
[28:52] with him
[28:53] as they mourned unwept
[28:56] and they when they had heard that he was
[28:58] alive
[28:59] and had been seen of her believe not
[29:02] after that he appeared in another form
[29:04] on the two of them as they walked and
[29:06] went into the country and they went and
[29:08] told it unto the residue neither
[29:10] believed them
[29:12] afterward he appeared onto 11 as they
[29:14] started meet and upbraided them
[29:16] with their unbelief and the hardness of
[29:18] heart because they believed not them
[29:20] which had seen him after he was risen he
[29:22] said unto them
[29:23] go into all the world and preach the
[29:25] gospel to every creature
[29:26] he doesn't believe it and his baptized
[29:28] shall be saved he that believeth not
[29:30] shall be damned and these signs
[29:32] shall follow them that believe in my
[29:34] name they shall cast out devils they
[29:36] shall speak with new tongues
[29:38] they shall take up separates and if they
[29:40] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[29:41] them
[29:42] they shall lay hands on their sick and
[29:44] they shall recover so then after the
[29:46] lord had spoken unto them he was
[29:48] received upon to heaven
[29:49] and the heavens sat on the right hand of
[29:51] god and they went forth and preached
[29:53] everywhere
[29:54] the lord working with them and
[29:56] confirming the word
[29:58] with signs following it's in john 14 12.
[30:03] verily verily i say unto you he that
[30:05] believeth on me the works that i do
[30:07] shall we do also and greater works than
[30:09] these shall we do
[30:11] because i go unto my father our last
[30:14] scripture reading from hebrews 13 verse

[30:29] meats
[30:30] which have not profited them that have
[30:32] been occupied therein may god bless his
[30:34] word you may be seated

[32:05] on the bible talk about an amplified
[32:07] verse nine of hebrews
[32:09] he said do not be carried about by
[32:11] different and varied and
[32:12] alien teachings for it is good for the
[32:15] heart to be established
[32:16] and ennobled easily amplified and
[32:19] strengthened
[32:20] by means of grace which is called favor
[32:22] and spiritual blessings

[34:48] remember that vision that morning god it
[34:50] wrote here in the cornerstone
[34:52] this is not your tabernacle
[34:55] do the work of an evangelist make full
[34:58] proof of your ministry
[34:59] he said i love it i love god's children

[35:13] know
[35:14] i don't know the next move i am waiting
[35:17] for it
[35:18] but i think according to the scripture
[35:20] listen this partner
[35:21] the word has been sold the next thing
[35:25] is the coming forth of the spirit
[35:28] not more word not more teaching
[35:32] hallelujah if the word is shown the next
[35:36] thing
[35:36] supposed to be the spirit or else could
[35:40] the bride be anointed
[35:42] when the spirit and the bride could say
[35:44] come
[35:45] oh hallelujah jesus returned in the
[35:48] power of the spirit
[35:49] took the scripture and find the place
[35:51] where it's written
[35:52] the spirit is upon me for he had
[35:55] anointed me
[35:56] to preach the jubilee and the song of
[35:59] trumpet
[36:00] that freedom time is here oh glory to
[36:02] god revival time is here
[36:05] healing time is here deliverance time is
[36:08] back here

[36:34] harvest

[36:39] when the spirit falls not if
[36:42] not when what are you talking about it
[36:45] happened yet
[36:49] i don't care who that preacher that's
[36:50] the business but when what we're looking
[36:52] for
[36:53] when what we're looking for when would
[36:55] we probably sign a boat
[36:57] when what we came in for when were
[36:59] people laughing because we
[37:00] we stand here too long i am moving

[37:30] all glory to god hallelujah
[37:36] when what if when
[37:42] when the spirit falls there will come a
[37:45] move amongst the people

[39:22] walk
[39:23] come on the death mask here oh glory to
[39:26] god we will have no control

[39:47] isaiah 29 18 says and in that day shall
[39:50] the death hear the words of the book
[39:53] and the eyes of the blind shall see out

[40:28] unless he stand
[40:30] in that condition in an eternal state as
[40:32] such
[40:33] he cut him off from it but in this hour
[40:34] here that same god
[40:36] that cut adam from that tree is striving
[40:40] and pushing and pressing to get you back
[40:43] to that tree
[40:44] oh glory to god do you believe that that
[40:47] tree is the life tree the way of life

[41:20] nothing but the blood
[41:22] god could only you his word god can't
[41:25] use your tears and you're feeling sorry
[41:27] for yourself

[41:30] his word
[41:31] not your not your righteousness not your
[41:34] holiness
[41:35] not your purity that is filthiness sight
[41:38] but when that alters colored blood not

[41:55] was crucified on calvary
[41:56] and when his blood was shed it paid the
[41:59] price
[42:00] it was a blood price to redeem us it was
[42:02] a black price
[42:03] to restore us it was a blood price to
[42:05] reconnect us
[42:07] and now this morning we are reconnected
[42:10] because we're going back to eden by the
[42:12] altar

[52:21] the walking are getting king he sent
[52:23] soul to samuel

[52:29] god tells us all samuel that's the man
[52:31] to rule for my people
[52:34] are they ma'am but when the time and
[52:37] come go

[52:42] god always give a better man you know
[52:44] you know what he after perfect man
[52:47] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you
[52:50] we're not living in luther's age or
[52:51] wesley age we're living in this age
[52:54] where perfection is required
[53:01] too much let me let me head over here
[53:05] hallelujah my god
[53:08] this one thing i hate which is the deeds
[53:11] of the nicoletan i also hate that
[53:14] the true vine hated the formal deeds of
[53:15] the nicolaitans and so did god
[53:18] what was the deeds of the ephesians
[53:19] church and the church of ephesians
[53:21] became a doctrine in the pokemon church
[53:22] and ever since the first church it was a
[53:24] d next become a doctrine what was it
[53:26] then he broke it down nicolette and come
[53:28] from the word nico
[53:29] which means to conquer or overthrow lee
[53:31] turns the lady
[53:33] now watch you know i read this many
[53:35] times
[53:36] but this time i drive with a shloka
[53:39] so i was always examining every word and
[53:41] when you slow down
[53:43] you see a little more than when you zoop
[53:45] and tell me i'm reading bible we need
[53:47] soup and we're just going through
[53:48] i'm just hitting it so but when you slow
[53:50] down you recognize it have more to it
[53:52] than meets the eye
[53:53] so when i drive in slow they won't pick
[53:55] up here now god had
[53:57] pastors okay nikolas i mean over to
[54:01] conclude
[54:02] which they were trying to do they was
[54:04] trying to take the church where god had
[54:05] pastors
[54:06] and the spirit of god moving
[54:10] so not moving moving by gifts
[54:13] in the church
[54:16] of the living god and they were having a
[54:18] doctrine
[54:20] that start that they were going to have
[54:21] some priests and bishops and
[54:24] popes and god said he hated it
[54:28] nicoletanes means to overthrow the laity
[54:30] to conquer the laity in other words
[54:33] take all the sacredness all the power
[54:36] from the church and put it on the priest
[54:41] if that happened now i don't know what
[54:44] happened
[54:46] because right now that would have a holy
[54:47] order
[54:50] let the congregation live any way they
[54:52] want to but the priest is the holy one
[54:56] taking this is taking the holy ghost
[54:59] away from the people
[55:01] with signs wonders following
[55:04] them take that away and give them a holy
[55:08] priesthood
[55:09] and i will add a holy priesthood
[55:11] bringing mysteries
[55:14] nothing wrong with preaching mysteries
[55:15] you know but these signs
[55:18] shall we follow not preachers
[55:23] not bishops them that's you
[55:26] them that believe you don't have to ask
[55:30] permission to be a believer
[55:33] not even you are the believer the
[55:35] believer is the word in you who give the
[55:37] lord a shout
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:42] so they were taken away the holy ghost
[55:45] and swapping it
[55:46] for a priesthood hallelujah
[55:49] who is who in the world is the head of
[55:53] god's church but him himself
[55:55] he said who is happy religious the holy
[55:58] ghost was sent to rule the church
[56:00] not just the preacher the whole
[56:02] congregation
[56:03] just the preacher be holy no it's all
[56:05] the church has to have the holy ghost
[56:07] oh give the lord some praises glory
[56:12] hallelujah so paul's wolves he said
[56:15] after my departing
[56:16] worlds will come in paul wolves he said
[56:19] has become the nicolaitan
[56:21] they were trying to form a priesthood
[56:22] like a levitical priesthood which was
[56:24] foreign to the new testament doctrine
[56:27] remember the new testament doctrine the
[56:29] new testament they went to the jew the
[56:31] gentiles
[56:32] the genders have not do with the
[56:33] physical priesthood that's a jewish
[56:35] thing
[56:36] they're trying to bring back this
[56:37] special man after holy temple
[56:40] that why when he veiled when jesus died
[56:41] he failed remember he talked about
[56:44] because there's one man going inside
[56:45] there and coming out he's a special man
[56:47] holy congregation happy glory hallelujah
[56:49] we forgive for a year
[56:50] but when jesus busts our view from the
[56:52] top to the bottom he's showing that you
[56:54] as a priest you yourself
[56:55] could go inside yourself and be a
[56:57] partaker of this glory
[56:58] you're not leaving you're dry you're not
[57:00] leaving you're dead you're leaving here

[59:58] until you live a holy life
[1:00:02] god refuses your sacrifice
[1:00:05] the sacrifice must be offered with holy
[1:00:07] hands
[1:00:08] the high priest before he could even
[1:00:10] come to offer the sacrifice he had to be
[1:00:12] holy and dedicated and anointed
[1:00:15] and perfumed and everything else before
[1:00:16] he could even walk in the presence of
[1:00:18] that sacrifice

[1:00:59] about
[1:01:00] the key given to me of the lord whereby
[1:01:03] i was able to determine the messenger
[1:01:05] for each age is a more scriptural one
[1:01:07] in fact it might be called the keystone
[1:01:10] of the bible
[1:01:11] it is the revelation that god never
[1:01:13] changes
[1:01:14] and that his ways are unchangeable as he
[1:01:17] is
[1:01:18] in hebrews 38 and that's where we get it
[1:01:21] from
[1:01:22] it says jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:01:24] today and forever
[1:01:26] oh hallelujah here it is and on changing
[1:01:29] god with unchanging ways what he did at
[1:01:31] the first he would have to keep on doing
[1:01:33] until it's done for the last he done it
[1:01:35] before he has to do it again
[1:01:37] he have to do it must
[1:01:41] must oh god must
[1:01:44] you're going to be healed oh glory to
[1:01:47] god you're going to be delivered
[1:01:49] he did it before he can do it again fire
[1:01:52] will break up on your soul he did it
[1:01:54] before he gonna do it again
[1:01:56] oh glory to god he came to set the
[1:01:59] captain free
[1:02:00] because he said the spirit is upon me oh
[1:02:02] glorious spirit at the confess
[1:02:05] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:02:08] hallelujah
[1:02:09] glory to god amen we know exactly from
[1:02:12] the word which was recorded by the holy
[1:02:14] spirit
[1:02:15] how the original church was founded how
[1:02:17] god manifests himself to her
[1:02:18] the word can't change because the word
[1:02:21] is god
[1:02:22] thus the church was at pentecost is the
[1:02:25] standard
[1:02:26] that is the pattern there is no other
[1:02:29] pattern
[1:02:30] no matter what the scholars say no
[1:02:32] matter what the people are preaching the
[1:02:33] message say
[1:02:34] when you have the seed you have the holy
[1:02:36] ghost and you have this and you have
[1:02:37] that don't know what they say
[1:02:38] what they had on pentecost was the
[1:02:40] pattern
[1:02:42] [Applause]
[1:02:45] the prophet talked about um philip and
[1:02:47] and different ones when they saw the
[1:02:48] lighted quicken them
[1:02:49] and they started to follow jesus peter
[1:02:51] heard it quickly and he followed jesus
[1:02:53] mary heard it quicken and follow jesus
[1:02:55] but all them who get quitting have to go
[1:02:56] in the upper room
[1:02:58] are not hearing you i'm not here with
[1:03:01] you
[1:03:02] mary said be it done unto me yeah call
[1:03:04] it that i would she said i will grow up
[1:03:06] a room
[1:03:06] because up there is the power somebody
[1:03:08] said power
[1:03:10] not blessing power not anointing they
[1:03:12] had that
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:14] power
[1:03:16] out of his belly out of his belly
[1:03:20] out of his belly shall flow
[1:03:23] shall flow shine flow shine flow
[1:03:27] rivers of living water
[1:03:31] oh god i locked it i locked him i can't
[1:03:34] get out of this
[1:03:38] he not believe it on me as the scripture
[1:03:41] had said
[1:03:42] out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:03:46] this picky of the spirit that they shall
[1:03:50] receive
[1:03:51] for their spirit was not that given yet
[1:03:54] was prophecy coming to them
[1:03:57] oh glory hallelujah my god as long as
[1:04:00] men are being called
[1:04:02] and sent forth with the word of life
[1:04:03] there's an apostle going on going on
[1:04:06] oh my hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:04:11] i love this part here what the church
[1:04:14] had at pentecost
[1:04:16] is her inalienable right
[1:04:20] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:04:22] she had the power of the spirit
[1:04:23] manifested in diverse signs wonders
[1:04:25] because holy ghost
[1:04:26] the children church was never organized
[1:04:28] by men
[1:04:30] it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't
[1:04:31] big it was hated on the spines
[1:04:33] it was oppressed it was persecuted unto
[1:04:35] death but it was true to god
[1:04:37] it stayed with the oceanal pattern so
[1:04:40] this
[1:04:41] keystone people stating it is the
[1:04:44] capstone ministry
[1:04:45] in mechanics and dynamics to prove he's
[1:04:48] the same yesterday
[1:04:49] today and forever we have to prove it we
[1:04:51] can't just talk that
[1:04:53] we have to prove he's the same remember
[1:04:55] the kangaroos have to be proven
[1:04:56] and to prove that it will take the
[1:04:58] capstone ministry of jesus christ
[1:05:00] which is dynamics and mechanics together
[1:05:03] all glory to god to prove it on the spot
[1:05:05] that's why i say which man on it could
[1:05:08] say sylvan gold her line on
[1:05:10] such as i have i give it unto you peter
[1:05:12] had it
[1:05:13] we have to have that same thing oh glory

[1:05:19] my my my my my oh glory to god theatre

[1:05:30] with the power of god
[1:05:31] mark 16 action is the true church jesus

[1:06:08] antichrist spirit
[1:06:09] would come into the church defiling it
[1:06:12] making it look warm
[1:06:13] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:06:16] he fights that he cannot stand he knows
[1:06:19] that's what the devil knew if the people
[1:06:21] get the true revelation
[1:06:23] of the true church and god help us we
[1:06:26] got it

[1:10:49] oh my hallelujah
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] they could display the token hey why
[1:10:54] because the same spirit
[1:10:56] that was upon him before his crucifixion
[1:11:00] was upon them after the resurrection and
[1:11:03] the holy ghost is a token
[1:11:04] that the blood has been applied because
[1:11:07] it follows the blood
[1:11:08] here we go all the way from the book of
[1:11:11] redemption
[1:11:12] so when the blood from the book is
[1:11:13] preached let me say this when the true
[1:11:15] word is preached it's the blood
[1:11:17] and the holy ghost follows the blood
[1:11:20] from the book
[1:11:21] oh my i'm gonna finish here
[1:11:26] the children of the kingdom they must be
[1:11:28] the word of god manifested
[1:11:31] for the promised seed of that age that's
[1:11:33] them
[1:11:34] he said what we need is the same spirit
[1:11:37] you can keep on playing
[1:11:40] he's the same but we need the same
[1:11:42] spirit that give it
[1:11:43] to teach it to us how we need a spirit
[1:11:47] the revelation by the spirit listen to
[1:11:48] these words how we need
[1:11:51] the revelation by the spirit
[1:11:54] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[1:11:57] a new translation
[1:11:58] though some are very good i am not
[1:12:00] against them but we need
[1:12:02] the revelation of the spirit and thank
[1:12:05] god we can have what we need
[1:12:07] for god wants to reveal his word to us
[1:12:10] by his spirit may god begin by his
[1:12:12] spirit to give us continuous
[1:12:14] life-giving and prevailing revelation oh
[1:12:17] if the church could only get a fresh
