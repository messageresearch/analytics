[44:45] a couple of visits from there First
[44:47] Peter 1 14-25 acts 1 8.
[44:51] Us in John we read 1 1 and then we go to
[44:53] 11 to 13. praise God
[44:56] okay
[44:58] it's in John 1 1 in the beginning was
[44:59] the word and the Word was with God and
[45:02] the Word was God and we go down to 11.
[45:05] he came onto his own his own receive him
[45:07] not but as many as received him to them
[45:11] give you power to become the sons of God
[45:13] even to them that believe in his name
[45:15] which were born not of blood nor of the
[45:19] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[45:23] but of God
[45:25] First Peter chapter 1
[45:27] read from verse 14.
[45:29] it reads as obedient children not
[45:32] fashion in ourselves according to the
[45:34] former lust in your ignorance but as he
[45:37] which I call you is Holy be holy in all
[45:41] manner of conversation
[45:42] and that would conversation is means
[45:44] manner of life
[45:45] 16 because it is written be holy for I
[45:48] am Holy and if he call on the father who
[45:51] without respect of persons judge it
[45:53] according to Every Man's work
[45:57] in fear for as much as you know that you
[46:02] were not redeemed the corruptable things
[46:04] are Sylvan gold from vain conversation
[46:07] received by tradition from your fathers
[46:09] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[46:13] of a lamb without blemish and without
[46:15] spot who verily was ordained before the
[46:18] foundation of the world but was
[46:19] manifesting these last times for you who
[46:22] by him do believe in God that risen from
[46:25] the dead and give him glory that your
[46:27] Faith and Hope might be in God

[46:34] truth to the spirit under on fake love
[46:36] of the Brethren see that you love one
[46:39] another with a pure heart fervently
[46:41] being born again not of corruptable seed
[46:45] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[46:48] which uplivet and abideth forever for
[46:51] All Flesh is as grass and all the glory
[46:53] of man as the flower of the grass the
[46:56] grass withered the flower thereof
[46:58] followed away but the word of the Lord
[47:00] didn't do it forever and this is the
[47:02] word which by the gospel is preached
[47:05] unto you all our scripture acts 1 8 1 8
[47:09] says that he shall receive power after
[47:11] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[47:12] and you shall be Witnesses unto means

[47:18] Samaria are the uttermost part of the
[47:21] earth let us pray father we thank you

[47:40] Hallelujah
[47:43] I have two context scriptures that I
[47:45] would like to read there's something
[47:47] John 3 it says there was a man of the
[47:50] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[47:52] Jews the same came to Jesus by night
[47:54] said unto him Rabbi we know the daughter
[47:57] the teacher come from God for no man can
[47:59] do these Miracles except God be with him
[48:02] and Jesus answers said unto him verily
[48:04] violation to you except the man be born
[48:07] again you cannot see the kingdom of God
[48:09] and the kadema said unto him how can a
[48:12] man be born when he's old can he enter
[48:14] the second time in his mother's womb and
[48:16] be born and Jesus answered verily verily
[48:19] unto you except a man be born of water
[48:22] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[48:24] the kingdom of God that which is born of
[48:27] the flesh is flesh that which is born of
[48:29] the spirit is Spirit Marvel not what I
[48:31] see unto the day you must be born again
[48:33] the wind blew it were listed and though
[48:36] here is the song thereof but can't not
[48:38] tell when's it coming and when it go it
[48:40] so is everyone that is born of the
[48:43] spirit second context scriptures from
[48:45] first John 5
[48:46] First 48 for whatsoever is born of God
[48:50] overcometh the world and this is the
[48:53] victory that overcometh the world even
[48:54] over fate who is he that overcoming the
[48:57] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[48:59] is the son of God this is he here we go
[49:02] that came by water and blood even Jesus
[49:06] Christ not by water only but by water
[49:08] and blood it is the spirit that beareth
[49:12] witness because the spirit is truth for
[49:15] there are three that bear record in
[49:17] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[49:20] Ghost these three are one and they are
[49:23] treated their witness in Earth the
[49:25] spirit the water and the blood these
[49:28] three agree in one may God bless his
[49:30] word it's good to be here this morning
[49:33] and the scripted we read from first
[49:35] Peter uh and the Amplified it says live
[49:39] as children of obedience to God do not
[49:43] conform yourselves to the evil desires
[49:46] that govern you in your former ignorance
[49:49] when you did not know the requirement of
[49:51] the Gospel but as the one who has called
[49:54] you as holy you yourself also be holy in
[49:57] all conduct and manner of living for it
[50:00] is written yeah shall be holy for I am
[50:03] Holy and if you call him as your father
[50:07] who judges each one impartially a
[50:11] according to what he does then you
[50:13] should conduct yourself with true
[50:15] reverence throughout the time of your
[50:18] temporary resident on Earth with a long
[50:22] or short
[50:24] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:26] conduct yourselves with true reverence
[50:29] throughout the time of your temporary
[50:33] residence on Earth went along or short
[50:37] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:40] hallelujah praise God thank you Lord
[50:43] Jesus and then I went on to says uh you
[50:46] have been regenerated born again not
[50:49] from Mortal origin seed sperm but from
[50:53] one that is Immortal by the ever living
[50:55] and Lasting word of God born again by
[50:58] the Everlasting word of God isn't that
[51:00] something this morning all right let's
[51:02] go praise be to Jesus
[51:04] okay I decided to bring two questions
[51:06] answers to you this morning as a little
[51:08] appetizer bonus all right question how
[51:12] can a Christian get deeper in the love
[51:14] of God question answer read a word and
[51:17] pray
[51:19] read the word of God and pray
[51:21] simple answer you get that one how can a
[51:25] Christian get deeper in the love of God
[51:27] read the word and pray
[51:28] second question do your children have to
[51:31] have an experience to have the Holy
[51:34] Spirit
[51:35] if they see the end time message do they
[51:38] have the Holy Spirit these are classic
[51:40] questions a classic question I love it
[51:43] so you're saying no if they see the
[51:45] message do they have the Holy Spirit see
[51:47] yeah good Baptist when you believe you
[51:49] have it you see it
[51:52] everyone must have an experience
[51:56] your children kind of go in on no other
[52:00] way but the same way you do
[52:02] they have got to be born again
[52:05] there is no grandchildren in the kingdom
[52:07] of God they are all children they must
[52:11] have it must have an experience with God
[52:14] to go in
[52:16] has nothing to do with your CD message
[52:18] must have an experience of God to go in
[52:21] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[52:24] praise girls have a title this morning
[52:26] born not of the will of man but of God
[52:30] oh blessed be the name of born not of
[52:33] the will of man but of God praise the
[52:35] Lord you love him
[52:37] praise God Mimi I'll see if I could get
[52:40] it in the Amplified and let's see what
[52:43] that says here praise God to us blessed
[52:45] be the name of the Lord
[52:47] oh give him praise though
[52:50] [Applause]
[52:57] all right
[52:58] in the Amplified which was 12 John 1 as
[53:02] many as did receive and welcome him he
[53:04] gave the authority power privilege right
[53:07] to become the children of God that is to
[53:10] those who believe adhere to and trusting
[53:12] and rely on his name who all their birth
[53:16] neither the Bloods nor to the will of
[53:19] the flesh that is by physical impulse
[53:22] nor to the will of man that is of a
[53:24] natural father but to God they are born
[53:26] of God oh blessed be the name of the
[53:29] Lord so the birth God wants to put on
[53:31] you is have nothing to the will of the
[53:33] father or the desire of the flesh but is
[53:36] of God born not of the will of man but
[53:40] of God oh praise the name of the Lord
[53:43] you love him this morning
[53:46] so I'm just going to go through some
[53:47] things and you'll see what the Lord will
[53:48] do the first doctrine of Jesus was you
[53:52] must be born again
[53:53] that was his first Doctrine and it's a
[53:56] very deep one
[53:57] there are so many different meanings
[53:59] that people put to it nearly all
[54:00] churches say You must be born again each
[54:02] one of a different interpretation of
[54:04] what it means to be born again remember
[54:06] it didn't say you ought to be born again
[54:08] he said you must and the English people
[54:11] understand the word must means it's
[54:14] absolutely you've got to do it it's a
[54:17] must not you ought to or you're better
[54:19] off if you did but you must be born
[54:21] again and we would like to take that
[54:24] word this morning and break it down that
[54:26] it is totally impossible it's essential
[54:29] and great it's totally impossible to
[54:31] enter the kingdom of God or even see it
[54:33] until you are born again
[54:35] born again we ought to seek it out with
[54:37] all our hearts to find out what it means
[54:39] and no matter how much you think you are
[54:41] right and we are right in saying a Creed
[54:43] and joining a church oh here this one no
[54:46] matter how much we think we are right
[54:48] insane of creed or joining a church you
[54:52] are still what you are until you are
[54:56] born again of the spirit of God
[54:58] it doesn't change you you change church
[55:02] that you change you you change Creed
[55:04] that you change you you change tracks
[55:06] that they change you something has
[55:08] happened within to change you or give
[55:10] the Lord some praises
[55:12] Hallelujah are you with me
[55:14] listen to it again your Creed join in
[55:17] church
[55:18] changing your ideas or your good
[55:21] intentions or do as good as it might
[55:23] seem it is still not right
[55:25] there is something got to happen
[55:27] something have to something have to
[55:30] happen the new birth is an experience
[55:33] something that take place I don't care
[55:36] what they say in this message a new book
[55:37] is an experience something that takes
[55:39] place that you alone know happen to you
[55:42] and when it happened to you know Devlin
[55:45] Hill could shake it out or take it out
[55:47] Jesus said in this way Upon This Rock
[55:49] I'll build my church and the rock is a
[55:52] revelation much as when Fire come upon
[55:54] that or give the Lord a praise Oh Glory
[55:56] look good
[56:02] maybe season
[56:04] do you get that
[56:05] Revelation is when the spirit reveals to
[56:08] you not your mother not your father you
[56:10] see when it's in your head somebody tell
[56:12] you this and you're going to show
[56:13] somebody telling this and you're going
[56:14] through somebody tell you this and your
[56:16] mind confused that is because you have
[56:18] no Revelation yet when that Revelation

[56:22] they could talk what they want if
[56:24] there's something other in your soul if
[56:26] the pastor backslide you not backsiding
[56:28] because there is something in your soul
[56:30] That's The Rock he said Upon This Rock

[56:36] upon concrete oh this is not the church

[59:58] the reason we have to be born again is
[1:00:01] because the Bible teaches us we will all
[1:00:04] born in sin
[1:00:06] shaped in iniquity and communist World
[1:00:09] speaking lies

[1:00:31] iniquity common the world speaking lies
[1:00:33] then that shows here we go that our need
[1:00:36] here to begin with is simple to start
[1:00:39] we are no good to begin with
[1:00:42] so we cannot claim anything by our
[1:00:44] shoulders our sincerity how great we are
[1:00:48] how little we are whatever more we are
[1:00:51] all together wrong
[1:00:54] whether you don't talk to nobody you're
[1:00:57] still wrong whether you're bold and
[1:00:58] aggressive you're still wrong whether
[1:01:00] you're dressed long you're still wrong
[1:01:01] whether you're just shocked you're still
[1:01:03] wrong or kill the Lord some praises
[1:01:06] this is nothing but the truth we pumping
[1:01:09] that word this morning oh God born in
[1:01:12] sendship iniquity that's why the First
[1:01:14] Gospel Jesus preached you must be born
[1:01:16] again
[1:01:19] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:21] hallelujah hallelujah could you imagine

[1:01:31] nobody press come down you must be
[1:01:34] born again got the Lord some praises
[1:01:39] they were going to tribulation with all
[1:01:41] your books with all your tips with all
[1:01:44] your knowledge and the Bible said in
[1:01:46] First Corinthians 13 do I have all
[1:01:48] knowledge and all knowledge and don't
[1:01:50] have charity it profited me nothing all
[1:01:54] glory to God do I have faith to move
[1:01:56] mountains it profit me nothing charity
[1:01:59] suffered long and it's kind charity that
[1:02:03] the buffed itself up that's not easy
[1:02:05] that easily provoked
[1:02:07] get me started this morning
[1:02:09] look at me started this morning all them
[1:02:13] big shots with the crazy mystery
[1:02:14] Revelations then I'm standing up in
[1:02:16] front of charity and tell them I know a
[1:02:18] new name I know the king's sword I know
[1:02:21] this and only trumpets I know the vials
[1:02:23] are not in between you third one
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:34] we are no good to begin with
[1:02:35] we cannot claim anything by our
[1:02:38] shoulders our sincerity how great we are
[1:02:41] how little we are whatever more we are
[1:02:43] wrong
[1:02:44] and there is nothing at all that we can
[1:02:46] do about it
[1:02:47] who given one thought
[1:02:50] Jesus said that God
[1:02:53] just by thinking see we get to Orlando
[1:02:55] see if we are short enough Whatever It
[1:02:58] Is by giving thought
[1:03:00] you can't add not one cubit to your
[1:03:03] stature
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] Hallelujah so watch he says here you
[1:03:10] know he said let's examine it so you you
[1:03:12] can't help yourself so just throw it all
[1:03:14] out I'm so glad it does because it laid
[1:03:18] in the thought of knowing something
[1:03:19] smart we poor illiterate people will be
[1:03:22] left out
[1:03:23] so we wouldn't have a chance but God
[1:03:25] changed it never had it that way in the
[1:03:27] beginning the churches always make it
[1:03:30] complicated
[1:03:32] yeah did you hear about currently the
[1:03:34] churches always makes it complicated
[1:03:36] that is why people talk about me because
[1:03:39] I see it so
[1:03:41] how they would unfolding
[1:03:44] one by the time tell me about you is
[1:03:46] patient too late
[1:03:48] you say praying for me that I could get
[1:03:50] deep I say pray for my brother pregnant
[1:03:51] brother because I've already I'm ready
[1:03:54] to go deep
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:14] we might barbecue it but it's the same
[1:04:16] word same message that's why I put some
[1:04:19] sauce in it but it's the same thing be
[1:04:21] satisfied with the word of God be
[1:04:24] satisfied with what God promised be
[1:04:26] satisfied it's a word to you
[1:04:30] oh
[1:04:34] so if you're inside of here in your feet
[1:04:36] I'm not revelating enough I know that's
[1:04:37] not a word or do I have enough
[1:04:39] Revelation pray for me
[1:04:40] oh God pray for my pastor give him
[1:04:43] Revelation Lord open his eyes
[1:04:46] help him Jesus
[1:04:48] Hallelujah
[1:04:50] all right so God made it simple and
[1:04:53] brought it to a place where all of us
[1:04:55] can see all of us can have it it is for
[1:04:58] whosoever will
[1:05:00] so to be born of the spirit
[1:05:04] or to be born of the flesh is to have
[1:05:06] the wisdom of the world and the wisdom
[1:05:08] will obey his fleshly teacher to be born
[1:05:10] of the spirit here we go is to believe
[1:05:13] and obey the teaching of the Bible
[1:05:17] by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:20] and a man that's born of the spirit will
[1:05:22] obey God's word regardless of what any
[1:05:25] tradition tells him
[1:05:27] now you may laugh but when I begin to
[1:05:29] read the word
[1:05:30] and I begin to see beautiful perfect
[1:05:32] certain scriptures was just quickly to
[1:05:34] me like that
[1:05:35] and I was in the Catholic church and
[1:05:37] when I went to the presented
[1:05:39] father foreign
[1:05:49] and and those days was the Gideon I
[1:05:52] think these rich people who buy Bibles
[1:05:53] and put it in hotels and stuff the
[1:05:55] Gideon people pass through the schools
[1:05:57] College Princess Stone and they give all
[1:05:59] the Bibles I see friends
[1:06:01] small little bible but I took it and I
[1:06:03] began to read it that was the beginning
[1:06:05] of I'm getting rechargeable
[1:06:07] I was connected to this little book I
[1:06:10] had that book with me all the time
[1:06:13] my book I was given that book and I kept
[1:06:16] it and I read it and it had something
[1:06:18] inside it was striking me well the thing
[1:06:20] was Matthew 5 14 beautiful perfect and
[1:06:22] in my spirit I wasn't baptized yet I
[1:06:24] didn't come to my message yet in my
[1:06:25] spirit I just felt something about that
[1:06:27] word I am to be perfect something deep
[1:06:30] inside I am to be perfect so when I
[1:06:32] connect with this message it was
[1:06:33] Perfection okay the Lord some Praises
[1:06:36] hey
[1:06:37] Abraham said
[1:06:39] Isaac loved Jacob Grace but chose a
[1:06:44] Perfection the Capstone where they'll
[1:06:47] get the lots of praises
[1:06:48] Hallelujah
[1:06:50] glory to God Amen
[1:06:52] all right
[1:06:54] so watch this now
[1:06:56] who
[1:06:57] so to be born of the spirit is to
[1:06:59] believe and obey the teachings of the
[1:07:01] Bible by the Holy Ghost and a man that's
[1:07:03] born of the spirit will obey God's word
[1:07:05] regardless of what any Traditions tells
[1:07:07] him you are reborn
[1:07:10] and I don't see people in organizations
[1:07:12] that born again
[1:07:13] he says sure not the organization is
[1:07:18] Born Again
[1:07:19] individuals in there are born again but
[1:07:22] the organization only breaks him away
[1:07:24] from God
[1:07:25] that's all it does separates you
[1:07:28] regardless of the flesh here we go
[1:07:30] denomination teaches the flesh
[1:07:34] so the national Spirits in this message
[1:07:37] Only Could Teach the flesh
[1:07:39] the cat is bride
[1:07:41] because they teach the people that are
[1:07:42] not born again of the spirit
[1:07:44] so for 40 years 30 years 20 years the
[1:07:47] teaching flesh and people like the flesh
[1:07:49] that's why they're staying so like the
[1:07:51] scripture my people like it so they like
[1:07:54] it so and they go take it so but the
[1:07:57] bride want this word
[1:07:58] friend
[1:08:00] or no friend or give the Lord a shout
[1:08:03] I'm saying it I say it to you friend or
[1:08:06] no friend whether I maintain my family
[1:08:09] or not let me maintain Christ
[1:08:13] oh lord is my prayer
[1:08:15] think or drunk
[1:08:17] denomination or no denomination friend
[1:08:20] or no friend family or no family are
[1:08:24] staying with this word okay the Lord
[1:08:26] some praises
[1:08:27] glory to God that's the revelation
[1:08:30] mine
[1:08:32] to be born again means to be built from
[1:08:35] above
[1:08:36] with it from above it means from above
[1:08:40] to be born means to be bulleted from
[1:08:42] above now watch you've seen a bird that
[1:08:45] comes from above because you've been
[1:08:47] born here not to be born again you have
[1:08:49] to be born from up here to be born again
[1:08:51] and that kingdom is so much higher than
[1:08:54] this Kingdom so much greater than this
[1:08:57] Kingdom till this kingdom is foolishness
[1:08:59] to that
[1:09:00] to be born of the spirit
[1:09:03] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[1:09:06] spirit
[1:09:07] is to understand and believe with your
[1:09:09] heart that Jesus is Christ and this is
[1:09:13] his word and no other words can be added
[1:09:16] to it or taken away from it without your
[1:09:18] name taken out of the Book of Life
[1:09:20] that's a strong one
[1:09:24] like us reading something whole a
[1:09:26] so-called Christian in America now when
[1:09:29] some pastors preaching about similarly
[1:09:30] monk they say we get a liberal gospel
[1:09:32] from
[1:09:42] that too easy
[1:09:44] so you see all the politics and all the
[1:09:46] mess I'm thinking twists in the people
[1:09:48] Minds that they know they rejecting the
[1:09:50] Bible itself they're rejecting what
[1:09:52] Jesus said love your enemies and do go
[1:09:53] to them they don't want that now
[1:09:55] some of them have Stones right Stone
[1:09:57] adulterers and so they might bring back
[1:09:58] the Old Testament and think they're
[1:09:59] ready the judge and the fight and the
[1:10:01] war they're ready for Back living
[1:10:04] that is why they're going to close only
[1:10:06] churches that is why in so-called
[1:10:08] Christians you know who didn't crucify
[1:10:10] Jesus it wasn't Romeo
[1:10:13] he came onto his own
[1:10:15] on his own we receive him not
[1:10:18] his own is who turned him down
[1:10:20] but as many as received him
[1:10:22] to them
[1:10:24] only to them give power shout out power
[1:10:27] the message will the one power they have
[1:10:30] a form of godliness and denying the
[1:10:31] power but he gets power
[1:10:33] to become
[1:10:35] come on now power to become
[1:10:38] faith is a revelation but on top of
[1:10:41] faith is that virtue and virtuous power
[1:10:43] and power is what powers you to
[1:10:46] knowledge and ten presentations of
[1:10:48] godliness and brotherly kindness power
[1:10:49] to become
[1:10:51] or can the Lord some praises the sons of
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:55] Oh Glory to God praise God brother
[1:10:58] Stephen God will have some sons in this
[1:11:01] last days some born Sons some cell Sons

[1:11:25] are some Sons like that right inside of
[1:11:26] his building I believe your sons are
[1:11:28] wrong in Trinidad praise God I believe
[1:11:30] they are Sons around the world
[1:11:32] and God will call him out one by one
[1:11:35] glory to God
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] it's God Amen
[1:11:40] all right
[1:11:44] let me read this again this is good
[1:11:48] to be born of the spirit is to believe
[1:11:51] and behave yourself in the spirit you
[1:11:52] know some people have no Behavior
[1:11:54] from small you know
[1:11:56] they get baptized and they say they
[1:11:58] change I'm still on no Behavior
[1:11:59] still Behaving Badly
[1:12:01] and sometimes if it's a choice
[1:12:04] you could choose to behave right
[1:12:06] that's a choice and you could choose to
[1:12:09] be you
[1:12:12] okay Jesus
[1:12:19] so you're talking about now
[1:12:21] it's a choice
[1:12:22] choice and behavior choice of attitude
[1:12:25] nothing could beat a winning attitude
[1:12:29] you can't be somebody positive and
[1:12:33] excited about the day you know you see
[1:12:35] when you're negative You're Expecting
[1:12:36] negative then you're looking for the god

[1:12:39] somebody to call again when your phone
[1:12:40] rings so you're expecting bad news
[1:12:44] because you're negative peace
[1:12:47] but when you see a positive you know
[1:12:50] nothing is shaking you from Romans 8 28.
[1:12:53] all things work together for good
[1:12:55] glory to God when the phone ring and
[1:12:58] it's something negative you put down
[1:12:59] your phone number glory to God how it is

[1:13:46] why you're in this message that's why it
[1:13:48] was foreign
[1:13:58] foreign
[1:14:02] let's go
[1:14:09] the new birth is to be built from above
[1:14:12] then we are active in the things from
[1:14:14] above
[1:14:15] oh my for it is himself acting in his
[1:14:19] word through you
[1:14:20] Born Again from above then we are active
[1:14:23] in the Kingdom above for his life is in
[1:14:26] us which is his word Vindicated the word
[1:14:31] itself
[1:14:33] I know we know it but listen to it again
[1:14:36] the spirit
[1:14:38] that is in you
[1:14:40] is the word made flesh in you
[1:14:46] or he said it this way the spirit is the
[1:14:49] word turned into power
[1:14:51] or the word turned on
[1:14:56] now the secret is what the word is in
[1:14:58] the bride and at the appointed time God
[1:15:00] turn the word on and the kingdom of Hell
[1:15:03] in trouble
[1:15:04] because that's the word turned on
[1:15:06] or give the Lord some praises
[1:15:09] do you catch it
[1:15:11] the secret is what the word is in the
[1:15:13] pride what were the pastor's word no God
[1:15:16] sent a prophet with the book open and he
[1:15:19] brought Spirit spoken words and he's in
[1:15:22] books and tapes and when we say what the
[1:15:24] tape say or Echo what the tape say this
[1:15:26] word goes inside of you not my
[1:15:29] Revelation not my interpretation I'm a
[1:15:31] eunuch I have no seed of my own I have
[1:15:34] no message of my own I am preaching
[1:15:36] another man's message God sent William
[1:15:38] Branham that last prophet of the last
[1:15:40] age as it was the four on the second
[1:15:42] coming of Jesus Christ Hollywood with a
[1:15:45] message or can the Lord our prayers we
[1:15:48] are in that message we are part of that
[1:15:50] message nobody could throw us out take
[1:15:53] us out

[1:15:56] nothing about it Oh Glory to God gave
[1:15:58] the Lord some Praises this morning
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:07] the spirit that's in you
[1:16:09] is the word made flesh in you
[1:16:11] the spirit Minds the word
[1:16:15] and is active and vindicating the word
[1:16:17] now the spirit is not active in any
[1:16:20] denomination
[1:16:22] it is not interested in making
[1:16:23] organization because the spirit itself
[1:16:26] is contrary to the organization so Holy
[1:16:28] Spirit could be there they may have an
[1:16:30] atmosphere anointing but not the spirit
[1:16:31] these Spirits are talking about
[1:16:33] the spirit is the word
[1:16:35] the spirit follows the word that's why
[1:16:37] the bride becomes a word for Revelation
[1:16:39] 20 17 to be effective and the spirit and
[1:16:42] the price say come the bride becomes the
[1:16:44] word and the spirit monks the pride and
[1:16:47] then the pride begin to speak and you're
[1:16:49] going to your family and you're going to
[1:16:51] your loved one and you're going to the

[1:20:03] let's continue
[1:20:05] you are time being until you are born
[1:20:08] again
[1:20:12] then you are Eternal being
[1:20:18] you are timed in until you are born
[1:20:20] again
[1:20:21] then you are Eternal being
[1:20:24] no
[1:20:33] Legos brother
[1:20:35] I don't care how much churches you
[1:20:37] belong to you're lost
[1:20:40] if you are not born again of the spirit
[1:20:42] of God
[1:20:43] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:46] you are lost all you haven't got eternal
[1:20:49] life
[1:20:50] an eternal life is the only thing that
[1:20:54] God will raise up because it is the only
[1:20:57] life that's left
[1:20:59] today we say a good church member shakes
[1:21:02] on with the pastor put his name on the
[1:21:03] Methodist or the Baptist and so forth
[1:21:05] lives a pretty good life now we
[1:21:06] missionaries we see those heathens live
[1:21:08] life that these Americans so-called
[1:21:09] Christians couldn't compare by no means
[1:21:11] so if a good life all accounts they
[1:21:14] receive the same as the rest of them by
[1:21:17] the idol the morals would smother over
[1:21:19] us to be when he's not a chance to stand
[1:21:21] in their presence
[1:21:22] that of the acts but that's not it
[1:21:25] said you must be born again and in order
[1:21:29] to be born again here we go is letting
[1:21:31] yourself go and die
[1:21:35] and our sharing of some brothers
[1:21:36] yesterday I always looked at in what
[1:21:39] people preach
[1:21:40] if they're preaching about debt and
[1:21:42] dying and Jordan and Crossing there's a
[1:21:44] particular picture I know we never talk
[1:21:46] about that and always troubled by that
[1:21:51] all that nice Jordan
[1:21:57] Jesus told the disciples except upon I
[1:21:59] will fall into the wrong and die alone
[1:22:01] you can live and have your own way and
[1:22:03] get in your own way all the time and
[1:22:05] when you when you don't get it you're
[1:22:06] kind of like a spoiled child
[1:22:09] you see children they want this they
[1:22:11] want that they want sweetie they want
[1:22:12] biscuit they want this
[1:22:17] that holds some bigger than this carrier
[1:22:22] that's not that is not I'll give a
[1:22:27] tantrum then right what God wants his
[1:22:29] sons to come is they come into
[1:22:30] discipline
[1:22:31] that you can do all what you have to do
[1:22:33] you can say what you want to say you
[1:22:35] can't act anyhow you wanna act you can't
[1:22:37] go anywhere you want to go the boy is
[1:22:39] going so you're going so too your
[1:22:40] friend's going so you're going so too no
[1:22:42] that certain place I can't go you
[1:22:44] shouldn't go there's certain things you
[1:22:46] shouldn't say
[1:22:47] there's certain things you shouldn't do
[1:22:49] glory to God and that pools your faith
[1:22:51] and confidence in what God Said in his
[1:22:52] word
[1:22:53] are you with me
[1:22:56] in order to be born again it's letting
[1:22:58] yourself go and die
[1:22:59] and the spirit of Christ coming to you
[1:23:02] then you're no more yours it is Christ
[1:23:05] in you Paul said I Die daily
[1:23:10] not seriously not monthly I die
[1:23:14] daily
[1:23:15] are things
[1:23:17] to die too

[1:23:20] on his car to another of a woman have a
[1:23:23] Crusher look at them
[1:23:25] something that could recognize his
[1:23:27] presence recognize a focus

[1:31:22] Saint John said he that believes on me

[1:31:31] go watch this yeah when the day of
[1:31:33] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:31:35] in one place one Accord not saying I'm a
[1:31:37] Methodist I am Baptist I am Lutheran I'm
[1:31:40] this they were in one place one Accord
[1:31:42] and suddenly they give him a song not up
[1:31:44] the road from the Seminary but from him
[1:31:46] a song like a Russian Mighty Wind and it
[1:31:48] fill all the house where they were
[1:31:49] sitting and the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:31:52] them
[1:31:53] do you ever hear anything message about
[1:31:54] oligos fell upon them no they have some
[1:31:58] man that he put that like easy Holy
[1:32:01] Ghost yourself
[1:32:03] and that same Nickelodeon thing where
[1:32:05] they put the anointing from of the
[1:32:07] people and put it on a man is where we
[1:32:09] end up with a popion
[1:32:10] you put it on a man you know so some
[1:32:12] people listen to the preacher and
[1:32:13] they're not even know the man preaching
[1:32:14] the word of God
[1:32:16] they have confidence in what he's saying
[1:32:17] because that he passed
[1:32:19] but is he saying what he prophecy
[1:32:22] foreign
[1:32:27] when you leave and go back home you
[1:32:29] should be able to find and read back
[1:32:30] just what is said
[1:32:33] people saying things that not any word
[1:32:36] it's so nice
[1:32:42] but it's not right
[1:32:45] and the Holy Ghost fell upon them and
[1:32:48] dear they went out in the streets
[1:32:49] staggering stammering on like a bunch of
[1:32:53] drunk men
[1:32:57] straight like a stick
[1:33:00] y Bible
[1:33:02] people want to know if it is without
[1:33:04] sensation with sensation
[1:33:08] this holy ghost that fell upon them it
[1:33:10] caused them to be walking all this
[1:33:11] staggering you ever see a drunk person
[1:33:13] yet
[1:33:16] you're not drunk people you see walking
[1:33:17] they walk to defend something you know
[1:33:18] they form get back up and fall to defend
[1:33:20] something you know because they're drunk
[1:33:22] a drunk man doesn't walk straight
[1:33:25] a drunk man just walk a certain kind of
[1:33:26] way
[1:33:28] somebody said what do you use against
[1:33:29] someone and I'll be drunk again
[1:33:35] Peter it was so early
[1:33:40] slowly
[1:33:45] so they know them tight with something
[1:33:47] else
[1:33:48] them they high on something else
[1:33:52] they they had new wine this wasn't from
[1:33:55] the bar this was from heaven
[1:33:56] because Revelation brings stimulation
[1:33:59] not knowledge Revelation brings
[1:34:01] stimulation knowledge is water but
[1:34:03] winders give you a stimulation one is
[1:34:06] making stand up miners make you run
[1:34:08] why those all glory do something
[1:34:11] different why does do that
[1:34:14] but ask me people forget about that you
[1:34:16] might be seated wine and oil is
[1:34:18] associated in worship oil is a Spirit
[1:34:21] Wine is a revelation the prophet said
[1:34:23] when Revolution hit himself he's running
[1:34:24] a tree when Russia hitches they want to
[1:34:27] run downstairs and come back up you can
[1:34:29] never get a religion so
[1:34:32] I know Revolution
[1:34:34] you're hearing sting
[1:34:36] it could be a Jehovah Witness preaching
[1:34:37] to you but brother when you get
[1:34:40] Revelation so listen listen listen that
[1:34:43] man that was gonna get called Beautiful
[1:34:44] when he when Peter said

[1:46:23] you lie to the Holy Ghost
[1:46:25] at that point it's happening with human

[1:46:47] then after that you know happened fear
[1:46:49] struck the prison
[1:46:51] the Bible said no man join yourself to

[1:46:55] nobody volunteered but I can make any
[1:46:58] home change I can Fellowship nobody knew
[1:46:59] nothing
[1:47:02] and the prophet said they're coming back
[1:47:04] to that
[1:47:06] Holy Ghost pillar fire drop on the man's
[1:47:08] shoulder sneak right out then you know
[1:47:10] it's not the man speaking it's God
[1:47:12] speaking
[1:47:13] God will send his own witness the
[1:47:15] witness of the Holy Ghost the angel of
[1:47:17] his presence to go before us the angel

[1:47:23] to the building
[1:47:24] Oh Glory to God give the Lord some
[1:47:26] Praises this morning Hallelujah
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:47:33] Jesus is the word of God I think we said
[1:47:35] this last week or Wednesday night to
[1:47:37] believe and he was busted open that life
[1:47:39] the life inside the seed this life which
[1:47:43] is Spirit water flowing over the spirit
[1:47:46] over the seat of God will bring forth
[1:47:47] the life of the seed it brings forth
[1:47:49] something else there's some other kind
[1:47:51] of seed there so it's if it's a seed
[1:47:53] it's watering it will produce the life
[1:47:56] of the seed so Jesus died to release his
[1:47:59] but from his body came water blood
[1:48:01] spirit right he released the watering
[1:48:04] Spirit to find the seeds
[1:48:08] dice hold this message from you
[1:48:10] because a spirit seven spirits was
[1:48:13] released throughout only it to pick up
[1:48:15] the seeds and connect you with the book
[1:48:17] because the book of your names in it so
[1:48:20] when God pick you up he connected his
[1:48:21] Pokemon books he connected to the
[1:48:23] message that you could see your name
[1:48:25] that you could know that you are now a
[1:48:27] predestineral seed Oh Glory to God give
[1:48:29] me come on say Amen somebody
[1:48:33] let's ride on me now
[1:48:35] when God said let there be light it
[1:48:37] wasn't like yet
[1:48:39] that word let there be light was a word
[1:48:41] seed
[1:48:44] it may take a million years and then
[1:48:45] there was light that's a real seed
[1:48:48] manifest because as a manifestation of
[1:48:50] the word seed let there be light so when
[1:48:52] God said let there be you that's
[1:48:54] potential
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:58] so the spirit find you connected to the
[1:49:01] word message and then the spirit has to
[1:49:02] connect back with you to baptize that
[1:49:04] seed inside of you
[1:49:06] with power
[1:49:07] oh get the Lord I shout in the house Oh
[1:49:10] Glory to God the water and spirit has to
[1:49:14] come upon your seed that you could be
[1:49:16] born from above not of the will of man
[1:49:19] not of the will of the flesh but of God
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:30] I have a sucker for you in a human being
[1:49:33] I will show you the Pentecostal wasn't
[1:49:35] really born you know
[1:49:36] all right let me you'll get it all right
[1:49:39] brother Brown
[1:49:41] the spirit of God
[1:49:44] comes forth to water the seed
[1:49:47] and if it's the seed it is watering it
[1:49:50] will produce the life of the seed
[1:49:53] how come they don't want to ask for the
[1:49:55] spirit
[1:49:56] when the spirit is what Waters the seed
[1:49:58] you know what also water deceive it your
[1:50:00] praises
[1:50:01] your praises your worship
[1:50:04] the same camel that Rebecca watered in
[1:50:08] the same camel that took her to Isaac
[1:50:11] oh give the Lord a shout
[1:50:14] he said the common is a power and your
[1:50:16] water the word with your praises
[1:50:18] with your shouts with your hallelujahs
[1:50:21] with your glory not what you have face
[1:50:24] and you're silent and the devil on top
[1:50:26] your top lip pausing on your mouth no
[1:50:28] you're up on your mouth and you give God
[1:50:30] some praises
[1:50:40] let me see them
[1:50:42] I'm telling you
[1:50:44] the devil but nowhere else I told my
[1:50:47] devil in Trinidad fighting worship
[1:50:49] fighting Praises fighting the atmosphere
[1:50:52] they're fighting everything because it
[1:50:55] gave the minister leeway to pump their
[1:50:56] own thoughts and ideas Oh Glory to God
[1:50:59] but if we're looking for the sea to come
[1:51:01] to life we have to get the water and
[1:51:03] spirit
[1:51:04] Oh Glory to God of the Holy Ghost to
[1:51:07] come upon that sea that's inside of you
[1:51:09] oh God remember the secret is
[1:51:12] the word is in the bride the secret is
[1:51:15] the seed is in the bride who brought the
[1:51:17] seed son of man okay the Lord some
[1:51:20] Praises Glory though God Luke 17 30. he
[1:51:24] brought the seed we don't have a seed
[1:51:26] the son of man is the sower but a
[1:51:28] Stephen of The Good Seed the good seed
[1:51:31] inside of you oh glory to God we're not
[1:51:35] anointing fall some will be for 84. some
[1:51:38] will be foreign
[1:51:41] but you will bring forth
[1:51:48] all right
[1:51:56] [Applause]
[1:51:59] so do you get it now
[1:52:01] watch
[1:52:02] if the spirit of God
[1:52:04] comes to water the ceiling it would
[1:52:07] produce the life of the seed
[1:52:08] and this is where but when I'm tired all
[1:52:10] within John 4.
[1:52:13] all of God's Sons must be the same
[1:52:17] to be born of the word and spirit
[1:52:22] ah
[1:52:24] you're born again of The Incorruptible
[1:52:26] will of God that's a script to be read
[1:52:28] right to be born of the word and spirit
[1:52:32] brings us back to the spoken word again
[1:52:36] like in John 3.
[1:52:38] so this is where he ties in you must be
[1:52:41] born again in this messaging This Time
[1:52:43] by word
[1:52:45] and spirit
[1:52:46] to be born of the water and the spirit
[1:52:48] what does it do it brings you right back
[1:52:50] into the place where you should have
[1:52:52] been at the beginning
[1:52:54] and that's the reason of Christ's debt
[1:52:56] to bring us right back to sons of God
[1:52:59] you must be born again
[1:53:01] Hallelujah not of the will of man but of
[1:53:04] God
[1:53:05] how by word
[1:53:08] and spirit
[1:53:09] so the Pentecostals they rejected the
[1:53:11] word
[1:53:12] they rejected the prophet and they
[1:53:14] couldn't move on to adoption and it
[1:53:16] appears that that was the birth but
[1:53:17] listen to this spot
[1:53:18] my
[1:53:20] no
[1:53:21] this brings you right back to spoken
[1:53:23] word then we are God's word made
[1:53:25] manifest
[1:53:30] that makes me a Brandon because I'm the
[1:53:32] seed the two agreements with their sperm
[1:53:34] together with the seed make me when God
[1:53:36] and His word becomes one that is when
[1:53:39] God's spirit Waters the seed of God
[1:53:42] which is the word of God it produces God
[1:53:45] it is not the individual
[1:53:47] when Jesus was raised in the dead what
[1:53:49] did he do he had a private Ministry to
[1:53:51] his disciples it wasn't by the Sea it
[1:53:53] wasn't feeding five thousand it wasn't
[1:53:55] to the multitude it was an idea it was
[1:53:57] to the group
[1:54:01] that the seven tons got other voices too
[1:54:03] it was to a group of elected believers
[1:54:06] Hallelujah where he opened the
[1:54:08] understanding
[1:54:10] and he opened the word
[1:54:12] it's two things because if the word
[1:54:14] don't open a word open you don't be
[1:54:15] understanding you're still messed up if
[1:54:17] you're understanding good and you don't
[1:54:19] have the word open you're still messed
[1:54:20] up it needs
[1:54:22] to have your understanding open and the
[1:54:24] word
[1:54:25] so when you're understanding and the
[1:54:26] Word was open they were ready
[1:54:28] to give Jesus a good sign off
[1:54:30] remember after Jesus died everybody
[1:54:33] crying and silently gone he gone he must
[1:54:35] have gone Jesus told everybody don't go
[1:54:37] the comforter will not come if I don't
[1:54:39] know the water will not come if I don't
[1:54:42] walk the spirit will not come I will not
[1:54:44] leave you comfortless I'm going to come
[1:54:45] to you okay the Lord I praise
[1:54:48] Jesus told them that when he wrote when
[1:54:51] he died they said he had to rebuke them
[1:54:54] and then when they get the group
[1:54:56] together he began to reveal to them the
[1:54:58] mysteries of what was promised for their
[1:55:01] day
[1:55:01] so he had to go into Isaiah 28 with
[1:55:04] Tamarin lips he had to go enjoy prophecy
[1:55:06] he shall come to pass I poured my spirit
[1:55:07] you have to identify himself in the Old
[1:55:09] Testament to identify to them what they
[1:55:12] must receive and then he breathed on
[1:55:14] them receiving Holy Ghost
[1:55:17] glory to God his breath he breathed upon
[1:55:21] them
[1:55:22] receiving the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and
[1:55:24] put them under expectation and say tarry
[1:55:27] in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:55:29] endured with power from on high not far
[1:55:32] from a book not performer understanding
[1:55:34] your Mysteries power from on high this
[1:55:36] is the one from above now this is fire
[1:55:38] from above power from above you know
[1:55:40] again from above all glory to God the
[1:55:43] rain from above

[2:01:44] God
[2:01:45] how are we going to finish yesterday you
[2:01:47] gotta all right let's get a home fishing
[2:01:53] so I have 19 pages and I'm page six this
[2:01:55] is great
[2:01:56] it's very good all right so he's talking
[2:01:58] about
[2:02:00] um
[2:02:01] but I was really excited about this he
[2:02:03] said now watch this sea church this real
[2:02:05] sea church with the true spoon
[2:02:08] the Enoch is
[2:02:12] all the big shots all the revelations
[2:02:14] all the inspiration and mystery
[2:02:16] preachers right remember God never
[2:02:18] committed his preaching and his gospel
[2:02:20] to an angel
[2:02:21] right so the angel
[2:02:24] it's the man right he never comes to the
[2:02:26] angels so Philip had been up to
[2:02:28] Pentecost Jerusalem to worship how many
[2:02:30] he says Amen to that do you not he had
[2:02:33] been really deity and LD and everything
[2:02:34] else but why didn't he get something
[2:02:37] he come back down studying the prophecy
[2:02:39] of Isaiah
[2:02:40] although Angel the angel directed Philip
[2:02:43] to him but the Doom of Life had to come
[2:02:46] through the body
[2:02:48] no he said brother we are on the line
[2:02:50] where did the term come from to the
[2:02:53] angel the angel showed him where to go
[2:02:55] and Angel is a messenger here's a son
[2:02:58] Philip at the gym the message the word
[2:03:03] that is how a child can be born
[2:03:05] oh Hallelujah are we coming back to that
[2:03:08] yes we are going to come right back to
[2:03:11] that so Philip had the gym
[2:03:13] the message the word now some people
[2:03:16] could only say message and word they
[2:03:17] can't say German
[2:03:19] inciting message come like a book giving
[2:03:21] out we're giving up but the gym had to
[2:03:23] be an inside Iman
[2:03:25] do you get that now all right here you
[2:03:27] know watch that's how watch me born
[2:03:29] Philip laid his hands upon Him Philip
[2:03:33] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:03:34] and there Comfort the spirit of God the
[2:03:37] germ had to come from the body what body
[2:03:40] Christ's body and Philip was a member of
[2:03:42] that body
[2:03:44] just two examples and we're gonna move
[2:03:45] on then he switches to Cornelius the
[2:03:48] same thing took place in Acts 10 48.
[2:03:50] Peter wasn't housed up angel directs him
[2:03:52] to conina's house but where did the word
[2:03:54] come from the body he said I feel pretty
[2:03:56] good I feel like traveling on watch now
[2:03:59] while Peter speak these words not the
[2:04:01] angel not the Cardinal while Peter spake
[2:04:04] these words he was the body he had the
[2:04:07] word the word took a hole the angel
[2:04:10] directed it but life come to the body Oh
[2:04:13] Glory to God so while Peter speak the
[2:04:15] word word and spirit Cornelius was
[2:04:17] filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:19] he was activated as a son and he get
[2:04:22] baptized yet Oh Glory to God that means
[2:04:26] the Holy Ghost come into a heart
[2:04:27] condition
[2:04:28] the right condition what was his
[2:04:30] condition fasting always a man a given
[2:04:33] person a free person and God have a
[2:04:35] memorial for how free he give Oh Glory
[2:04:38] to God God recognize the faith in that
[2:04:39] man and he was a gentile or give the
[2:04:42] Lord some Praises he wasn't a Jew he was
[2:04:44] a gentile and God fill him with the Holy
[2:04:47] Ghost isn't that right
[2:04:50] is identified scientifically
[2:04:53] and by the reaction by his character and
[2:04:55] everything else just the same as it was
[2:04:57] when it was in the dwelling in the body
[2:04:59] of God's only begotten son
[2:05:00] so does it dwell in the body of his
[2:05:03] adopted Sons for the last days
[2:05:06] prophecy
[2:05:07] just as the pillar
[2:05:09] fact was dwelling in Jesus Christ only
[2:05:12] begotten son so with that pill of fire
[2:05:14] dwell in the body of his adopted son in
[2:05:17] the last days
[2:05:18] are you with me now
[2:05:19] hallelujah hallelujah God is uniting his
[2:05:23] bride she is coming together from the
[2:05:26] East and the West not South there's a
[2:05:27] United sign what is United for the
[2:05:30] rapture
[2:05:32] what is getting already yes sir isn't
[2:05:34] that right she's United herself with a
[2:05:36] bridegroom and a bridegroom is the word
[2:05:38] and the church and the bride and the
[2:05:40] word is becoming one until
[2:05:44] the very word itself is working out the
[2:05:47] work of the bridegroom
[2:05:48] yes that's all you know we get in one we
[2:05:50] start a manifest the works
[2:05:52] of the bridegroom no more joint Church
[2:05:53] no more joint church he said watch
[2:05:56] United not join church he said the
[2:05:58] saints that are asleep in the dust of
[2:06:00] the earth will weaken
[2:06:02] and we will Unite with them the living
[2:06:04] ones with the ones that are already dead
[2:06:05] they're like Mundus and brother Knights
[2:06:07] and all them going on Amen going on
[2:06:09] before isn't that right it seems that
[2:06:11] are sleeping is that right watch and the
[2:06:13] ones that are living that uniting
[2:06:15] themselves with the word and those that
[2:06:16] are gone already did that it all comes
[2:06:18] together make one great Union and
[2:06:21] uniting before going up
[2:06:23] God uniting time remember now there's a
[2:06:26] uniting of the word bringing back the
[2:06:29] faith that was once delivered to the
[2:06:30] sins and that could only be done in this
[2:06:33] day the only time it could be done is
[2:06:35] right now it never was attacked anywhere
[2:06:39] else they went off in National sprees
[2:06:40] but now it don't belong to no
[2:06:43] denomination spirit because are you
[2:06:45] ready
[2:06:46] it is time for the anointing of men and
[2:06:48] women of every race
[2:06:51] every color
[2:06:52] every Creed everything under Christ by
[2:06:56] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:06:58] and back to the word
[2:07:00] he did not say United by some Revelation
[2:07:02] or some inspiration or some
[2:07:03] interpretation but but by the baptism of
[2:07:06] the Holy Ghost
[2:07:08] amen and back to the word
[2:07:10] brother Branham let me say something
[2:07:12] this United time to see Churches United
[2:07:15] Nations United I believe that the bride
[2:07:17] of Christ is called
[2:07:18] I believe she is sealed into the kingdom
[2:07:21] of God I believe the mechanics is here
[2:07:24] they are waiting for the Dynamics to
[2:07:27] take her off the Earth
[2:07:28] he is the dynamic
[2:07:30] [Applause]
[2:07:32] so how you can go without Christ
[2:07:34] the Capstone holy to the world Christ
[2:07:36] The Headstone how you could go without
[2:07:38] Christ's Dynamics
[2:07:40] he is the Dynamics we just become
[2:07:43] members of the machine of his body
[2:07:46] forming ourselves into His Image as we
[2:07:49] see him uniting himself with his works
[2:07:51] with his love gifts as he hands them to
[2:07:53] us just before the resurrection
[2:07:55] the Dynamics of this church
[2:07:57] I like what the prophet said
[2:07:59] here generalizes you know this church
[2:08:01] will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[2:08:05] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:08:08] while The Headstone is coming down
[2:08:11] to unite the body
[2:08:13] so what God is saying I'm gonna give you
[2:08:15] power
[2:08:16] virtue a small measure to work with it
[2:08:19] but that power will come at the top
[2:08:21] charity or clock will be the Dynamics of
[2:08:24] your mechanics oh give the Lord some
[2:08:27] praises
[2:08:28] the Dynamics of this church would be a
[2:08:30] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[2:08:32] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:08:34] while The Headstone is coming down to
[2:08:37] unite the body
[2:08:39] and when the head and body unites
[2:08:41] together with a punch the full power of
[2:08:43] the Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[2:08:45] exactly like that even the dead in
[2:08:47] Christ for hundreds of years ago will
[2:08:49] rise in the beauty of his Holiness and
[2:08:51] take a flight to the skies the Dynamics
[2:08:53] is the Holy Spirit
[2:08:55] Oh Glory get a lot some praises
[2:08:58] glory to God
[2:09:00] the Dynamics is
[2:09:02] the Dynamics is
[2:09:05] the Holy Spirit
[2:09:07] oh my
[2:09:08] God you may be seated
[2:09:11] and I'm not finished yet
[2:09:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:16] Oh Glory
[2:09:18] let's go
[2:09:19] chicken being born
[2:09:22] that's born from an egg it's maturing in
[2:09:25] his old eggshell the old inner parts of
[2:09:27] the egg has to rot away it has to take a
[2:09:29] little beak and scrape back and forth
[2:09:31] and break the shell out we call it
[2:09:33] dipping its way out
[2:09:36] they never found a better way it is
[2:09:38] God's provided way you try to help them
[2:09:41] you'll kill him
[2:09:43] you try to help him you kill him
[2:09:46] somehow we help any process we want to
[2:09:47] help be sorry for the person yeah
[2:09:53] some parents have killed right now
[2:09:57] but the wrong kind of love
[2:10:04] who either spoil children but not good
[2:10:06] now I don't have no grandchildren we are
[2:10:09] grandchildren oh God
[2:10:10] God had children and every Sunday coming
[2:10:13] to god let's not go there tonight
[2:10:17] what you try to help him you'll kill him
[2:10:19] pick the over him he will die he
[2:10:21] has got to labor
[2:10:24] train
[2:10:25] Ed and that's the way a Christian has to
[2:10:28] do it ain't somebody shaking your hand
[2:10:31] taking you in you got to lay it there
[2:10:33] till you die
[2:10:35] rot and a ball into the kingdom of God
[2:10:38] is this what the message we should know
[2:10:42] or is it that yeah I mean
[2:10:45] you know like somebody blessing every
[2:10:46] other Church
[2:10:48] and when they blast every other Church
[2:10:50] the people psychologically thinking that
[2:10:52] they are in the righteous you know
[2:10:54] is a psychological thing that they
[2:10:55] they're messing with people's mind
[2:11:02] they've seen everybody's enemy
[2:11:04] everybody did every Church did that's
[2:11:06] not true
[2:11:08] so then psychologically people say well
[2:11:10] we are right we are I privilege to be
[2:11:13] here boy
[2:11:19] you have a period to die
[2:11:21] to rut
[2:11:23] so that's why the Bible said the kingdom
[2:11:25] is preached and every man pressed their
[2:11:27] way into it it's a present some people
[2:11:30] loafing on their parents in church so
[2:11:32] they figure the people appears as
[2:11:33] Christians
[2:11:36] they're Christian too
[2:11:38] they're not true you know
[2:11:40] they're not sure at all
[2:11:42] so you watch that's the way Christian
[2:11:43] has to do it aims somebody just shaking
[2:11:45] your hand taking you in you got to lead
[2:11:47] it until you die rot and are born in the
[2:11:50] kingdom of God is God's providing rain
[2:11:53] and that comes through suffering that
[2:11:55] comes through pain just come to God
[2:11:56] cornering you and Outing you having your
[2:11:59] own way
[2:12:00] and making your whole stream
[2:12:03] see if your father and mother not having
[2:12:05] a holding strain and you just again your
[2:12:07] own way you can spoil breath you know
[2:12:09] like a spoiled child then you know God
[2:12:11] don't have none of that you know and God
[2:12:12] let your whole stream and I want to know
[2:12:13] why he taking the longer answer and that
[2:12:15] will be backstage thank God taking
[2:12:17] longer answer then then they start to
[2:12:18] answer for their own self and and then
[2:12:20] afterwards they have questions when the
[2:12:22] last go nuts because they go into a
[2:12:24] whole different thing altogether because
[2:12:25] they don't want to wait upon God but
[2:12:27] please the Bible says utterly fall but
[2:12:30] they just wait upon the Lord shall you
[2:12:32] their strength why don't you wait upon
[2:12:34] God
[2:12:35] yeah yeah wait upon God things that we
[2:12:37] cannot wait upon God stay on your knees
[2:12:39] stay in prayer stay in the spirit until
[2:12:42] God breaks you and give an answer he
[2:12:44] does answer
[2:12:45] hallelujah praise God
[2:12:47] they say they found no better way for
[2:12:49] baby right when a baby is born you could

[2:15:04] he said well you know you'll be seated
[2:15:06] all right oh yeah time all right we know
[2:15:08] the overseas must before music can come
[2:15:11] out of the old seed it must rot
[2:15:13] absolutely not die only but rot after it
[2:15:16] is dead that's an extra thing now after
[2:15:19] dead is the rot now then he said now we
[2:15:22] know that it's true and that's the same
[2:15:24] thing in the New Birth we never go back
[2:15:26] we go forward when you're born again and
[2:15:29] that's why I think that there's so many
[2:15:30] they have no so many not rather genuine
[2:15:33] new Birds it's because the seed will
[2:15:34] sympathized with the word or the person
[2:15:36] but they don't want to rot away from the
[2:15:40] old system that they were in
[2:15:49] there's a bunch of foolishness and they
[2:15:51] come I remember in the early days when
[2:15:53] people come on arima when we have a
[2:15:55] vasilica service I say you come here
[2:15:56] because any Deliverance because people
[2:15:57] come looking to help and they come
[2:15:58] through this thing and they come with
[2:16:00] all the benefits
[2:16:02] a sister come and she wants to know she
[2:16:04] wants to know what she want to do stuff
[2:16:05] I said listen my wife you know because
[2:16:07] the church she was in from the pastor
[2:16:10] wife wasn't in order so therefore she
[2:16:12] was doing a set of stuff that he passed
[2:16:13] what I'm supposed to do I say this you
[2:16:15] know I said my wife's in order you know
[2:16:16] so I have no vacancy for that person out
[2:16:18] there
[2:16:23] you know
[2:16:25] we're looking normal normal but there's
[2:16:27] a something inside of us you know we
[2:16:29] could stand normal normal too you know
[2:16:30] we could tell you the truth normal
[2:16:31] normally you know oh Hallelujah they
[2:16:34] don't want to rot away from the old
[2:16:37] system that they were in they don't want
[2:16:39] to come out of it they want to stay in
[2:16:41] the old system and clean the new bird
[2:16:43] you can't say independence message you
[2:16:46] you can't claim in a sexy church and
[2:16:48] claim the Seven Seas break to you that
[2:16:49] can't work that way yeah
[2:16:51] they have to leave them groups and leave
[2:16:53] them churches they have to get out is
[2:16:55] the old system then rather it praise God
[2:16:58] foreign
[2:16:59] this is important they know the whole
[2:17:03] system is dead
[2:17:04] but they just don't want to rut out of
[2:17:06] it no rot is when you're already done
[2:17:09] away with it
[2:17:10] here we go are you ready
[2:17:12] now this is a special teaching this
[2:17:14] morning
[2:17:14] a clean
[2:17:17] that they are newborn
[2:17:19] but a claim
[2:17:21] is only a begotten sign
[2:17:25] rotten brings forth the new birth
[2:17:30] and what is a soaking
[2:17:31] because it's not more in this
[2:17:34] claim is a big cotton sign I claim the
[2:17:37] Holy Ghost I claim my healing I claim I
[2:17:39] claim I claim I claim but rotten brings
[2:17:41] forth to New Birth all right let me
[2:17:43] continue when Wesley it ceased on all
[2:17:46] these ages or blades come out of the
[2:17:47] stalk or tassel when the Pentecost will
[2:17:50] come up to the restoration of the gifts
[2:17:51] they have to come out of the Baptist
[2:17:52] Presbyterian but with Holiness Nazarene
[2:17:55] Jesus Christ so-called all of that they
[2:17:57] have to come out of it and rot away from
[2:17:59] it to accept the new birth
[2:18:01] praise God
[2:18:02] what about him
[2:18:04] because
[2:18:06] okay so Judas come back with joy he said
[2:18:07] remember them right he said and they
[2:18:10] come back rejoicing he Rejoice he said
[2:18:12] don't Rejoice Jesus that the devil is
[2:18:13] subject to you but Rejoice because the
[2:18:16] names written on the book of life
[2:18:17] because your name is on the book of life
[2:18:19] because it is in heaven no watch
[2:18:22] but that still doesn't mean that you are
[2:18:24] saved you are not converted until you
[2:18:27] receive the Holy Ghost
[2:18:29] remember that you're only potentially
[2:18:32] converted if you're asking for oak tree
[2:18:35] and I give you an acorn potentially you
[2:18:36] have a oak tree if you ask me for a
[2:18:38] cornfield and I see a corn come up at
[2:18:40] that high potentially avoc Field of Corn
[2:18:43] but it's not developed yet something
[2:18:45] could happen no you're on your road now
[2:18:48] to justification sanification to the
[2:18:50] bathroom of Holy Ghost but when you are
[2:18:52] genuinely baptized with the Holy Ghost
[2:18:54] you are in the king them
[2:18:56] no you say brother is that true then he
[2:18:59] going on in the wood now I'm only home
[2:19:01] fresh here
[2:19:02] Saint John 17 17 Jesus said sanctify
[2:19:04] them by their truth that word is truth
[2:19:06] and Judas Peter on the night of betrayal
[2:19:09] he said to Peter after you are converted
[2:19:13] then striking your brethren
[2:19:15] after you're converted the man had
[2:19:18] followed him for three years had his
[2:19:20] name on the Lamb's Book of Life had cast
[2:19:22] out Devils done great works healed don't
[2:19:25] all kind of preach the word and
[2:19:27] everything else and still wasn't
[2:19:28] converted
[2:19:32] Peter
[2:19:38] he switches here now
[2:19:40] about a baby
[2:19:42] when the Act take place between egg and
[2:19:44] sperm
[2:19:45] potentially the baby is dear when the
[2:19:48] ACT is done
[2:19:50] together and that is in the mother's
[2:19:53] womb is potentially a baby
[2:19:58] watch then the body is developed second
[2:20:00] stage
[2:20:01] but the baby has to be born here and
[2:20:06] then it receives the bread of life
[2:20:09] it is not the Breath of Life you say oh
[2:20:12] it's a life no it isn't
[2:20:14] that is little nerve-juking and muscles
[2:20:16] the baby hasn't received life till it is
[2:20:20] born you may jump and jerk but you've
[2:20:24] got to be born
[2:20:27] so he's teaching something here now do
[2:20:29] you get that now egg and sperm come
[2:20:31] together Life begin to form but that
[2:20:34] they're born yet
[2:20:35] that's only begotten
[2:20:40] now let's notice Luke 24 49 he had
[2:20:44] commissioned the apostles after they
[2:20:45] have been saved and sanctified then he
[2:20:47] gives them power to heal the sick Castle
[2:20:48] devils and so forth
[2:20:50] and the Holy Spirit you are believing
[2:20:52] unto eternal life and when the Holy
[2:20:55] Spirit comes it is eternal life
[2:20:58] then he switches again this is very
[2:21:00] important this is one of the most
[2:21:02] important part of the service today this
[2:21:04] part you have to listen to this part
[2:21:06] watch
[2:21:08] your begotten of the
[2:21:10] of the sanctification
[2:21:16] so sanctification is the blood
[2:21:20] isn't that right
[2:21:22] water
[2:21:23] blood
[2:21:25] spirit
[2:21:26] and he is showing that sanctification is
[2:21:30] where you are begotten
[2:21:33] that means if you're not Sanctified
[2:21:34] there's a problem
[2:21:36] so you have to come at the
[2:21:37] sanctification
[2:21:38] before you get that full breath
[2:21:41] by the spirit
[2:21:43] you are begotten of the spirit of
[2:21:44] sanctification but never born of the
[2:21:47] spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in
[2:21:50] that's correct a baby got a life in the
[2:21:53] womb of the mother little muscles are
[2:21:56] quivered it's a life but it's a
[2:21:58] different life when it breeds the bread
[2:22:01] of life in this nostrils
[2:22:03] it is different
[2:22:05] my dearest Methodist brother primoleness
[2:22:07] sanitation is cleansing which is
[2:22:09] preparation of life but when the Holy
[2:22:11] Ghost comes it is life preparation is
[2:22:13] the cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost
[2:22:15] is filling the vessel sanification means
[2:22:17] clean and set aside for service the holy
[2:22:19] spirit is put it in service you are
[2:22:21] vessel that God have cleaned up
[2:22:24] all right be going great
[2:22:27] and we find out that the Holy Ghost is
[2:22:29] God himself God was above you in the
[2:22:30] pillar of fire with Moses God was with
[2:22:32] you in Jesus Christ now is God in you in
[2:22:34] the Holy Ghost not three Gods God had a
[2:22:37] plan he wanted to work among men he
[2:22:39] brought in the pillar of fire which was
[2:22:40] the Mystic fire that hung over the time
[2:22:42] of Israel and before Imam was I am he
[2:22:45] was that fire I come from God I go back
[2:22:46] to God is that right but here he is
[2:22:48] today the same Pillar of Fire doing the
[2:22:50] same things now notice Jesus
[2:22:52] commissioned them to Jerusalem and wait
[2:22:54] the word tari means to wait doesn't mean
[2:22:56] to pray there was not fit subjects yet
[2:22:59] to preach because they only knew his
[2:23:01] resurrection by his person
[2:23:05] let me read it again they only knew his
[2:23:08] resurrection by his person of seeing him
[2:23:11] outside he commanding them not to preach
[2:23:14] anymore not to do anything until first
[2:23:16] they had been endured with power from on
[2:23:19] high
[2:23:20] or give the Lord some Praises they knew
[2:23:23] of his resurrection but they didn't have
[2:23:25] that Resurrection inside of them they
[2:23:27] could see Jesus and say he is raised
[2:23:29] from the dead but that wasn't quick unto
[2:23:30] them they needed another witness then
[2:23:33] he'll perform on high and Jesus said you
[2:23:35] shall receive power after the holy water
[2:23:37] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[2:23:41] me
[2:23:42] [Applause]
[2:23:48] hello Brandon I do believe any preacher
[2:23:51] is sent of God or correctly ordained
[2:23:53] because God is infinite and what God
[2:23:55] does once he does all the time now if
[2:23:57] God would would not let them preach
[2:23:59] until they went to Pentecost and receive
[2:24:01] the Pentecostal experience no man unless
[2:24:04] somebody desire of his own or some
[2:24:06] organization has commissioned him has
[2:24:07] the right to end up Pulpit until they've
[2:24:09] been filled with the Holy Ghost because
[2:24:10] he's leading them by intellectual
[2:24:12] conception
[2:24:13] until he is filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:24:17] Hallelujah
[2:24:19] Hallelujah
[2:24:20] glory to God
[2:24:22] question
[2:24:27] when you use the expression that we do
[2:24:29] not believe the word we will be
[2:24:31] eternally separated from Christ do you
[2:24:34] mean the foolish versions will live
[2:24:36] eternally but they will be separated
[2:24:38] from the New Jerusalem where Christ will
[2:24:40] dwell with a bride
[2:24:41] here are those who do not have the Holy
[2:24:44] Spirit born again as the scripture
[2:24:46] speaks of being born again
[2:24:47] the natural birth requires water blood
[2:24:50] and spirit does not the spiritual bullet
[2:24:53] require all three stages of grace before
[2:24:56] the person's truly born again he said
[2:24:58] absolutely
[2:24:59] I just explained that this morning
[2:25:01] you've got to have all stages you are
[2:25:04] begotten of the spirit just like a baby
[2:25:07] is begotten in the womb of the mother
[2:25:08] but not born until they receive the Holy
[2:25:12] Ghost you are born then you are not
[2:25:14] converted you are in the possession of
[2:25:16] being converted until that time yeah the
[2:25:19] bomb are you ready
[2:25:20] that's the reason that all these great
[2:25:23] Mysteries could not be given to Luther
[2:25:25] could not be given to Wesley could not
[2:25:28] be given to the age just pass by the
[2:25:30] Pentecostal age they will begotten
[2:25:34] so brother Branham as a prophet
[2:25:38] revealing the son of man identify the
[2:25:41] Pentecostal experience as back in the
[2:25:43] womb
[2:25:46] so then he was waiting for a bright body
[2:25:48] that would be born of the word that
[2:25:51] could receive the Mysteries
[2:25:52] for Glory to God born of the word and
[2:25:56] spirit so the Pentecostals couldn't get
[2:25:58] the Mysteries because they were in the
[2:26:00] womb or give the Lord a shout so you can
[2:26:03] only correctly born of the word in this
[2:26:05] message bird and spirit corner of The
[2:26:09] Incorruptible word of God first the word
[2:26:11] coming to you and then the spirit comes
[2:26:13] and water the word inside of you glory
[2:26:16] to God
[2:26:17] are you ready
[2:26:19] we almost on the home stress here now
[2:26:22] Hallelujah
[2:26:23] here we go
[2:26:27] so then if that be so
[2:26:29] this is to be another Holy Ghost pouring
[2:26:31] out
[2:26:32] among the bright buddy
[2:26:34] I have to have a scripture a quote that
[2:26:36] identify when they're supposed to take
[2:26:38] place and then the prophet says in the
[2:26:40] super sign he said when that light
[2:26:41] struck little Rebecca she knew something
[2:26:43] was within her that reported to Isaac
[2:26:46] she failed the face she wanted no one to
[2:26:49] do with her own thinking Isaac wasn't
[2:26:51] thinking from then on and the church
[2:26:53] itself when it strikes that power of God
[2:26:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost prophecy
[2:26:59] out of the national churches so he's not
[2:27:02] talking about Pentecostal he's not
[2:27:03] talking about charismatics he's not
[2:27:05] talking about anybody is older he's
[2:27:07] someone in this message when the church
[2:27:09] strikes the power of God out of the
[2:27:12] universal churches out of the Catholic
[2:27:14] Church wherever it is when the baptism
[2:27:17] of the Holy Ghost is made real to the
[2:27:20] people
[2:27:23] you mean this baptism have to become
[2:27:25] real real real real real real real
[2:27:31] all right
[2:27:34] when the baptism Holy Ghost is made real
[2:27:37] to the people them that is predestined
[2:27:40] like you people here Dayton life see it
[2:27:42] and walk in it it's a super sign and
[2:27:45] you're going to possess the Gate of the
[2:27:46] enemy Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise
[2:27:50] God praise God music God please
[2:27:52] hallelujah praise God
[2:27:54] ours are more stuck but we'll leave it
[2:27:56] another time
[2:27:58] you'll be seated
[2:28:01] hold that God accept some in the church
[2:28:05] to deliver peace
[2:28:06] they get treatment
[2:28:09] when a church like this
[2:28:12] it's grown in under the persecution of
[2:28:15] the outside world believing in the Lord
[2:28:18] Jesus what you believe in that the
[2:28:21] promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:22] is just as real to us
[2:28:25] as it was the Pentecost that's on
[2:28:27] Tabernacle Church bright church this
[2:28:30] Holy Ghost has to be just as real you
[2:28:32] want the same Holy Ghost the same Penny
[2:28:35] same power same acts 1 8 you want
[2:28:39] nothing less than that glory to God
[2:28:42] watch when a church has grown in under
[2:28:45] the position of the outside world
[2:28:47] Jesus you may be seated that the promise
[2:28:49] of the Holy Ghost is just
[2:28:53] as it was the Pentecost how they groan
[2:28:55] and cry on the labor pains but when they
[2:28:58] are born unpositionally born into the
[2:29:01] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[2:29:04] set in the church some Apostles some
[2:29:07] prophets some teachers in other words a
[2:29:10] faithful Ministry is Spirited by a
[2:29:13] position of birth of the Holy Ghost and
