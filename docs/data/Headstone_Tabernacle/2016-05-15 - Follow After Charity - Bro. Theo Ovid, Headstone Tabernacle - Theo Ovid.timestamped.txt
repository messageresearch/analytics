[33:04] effort so just to connect back to last
[33:06] week's service we read the scripture
[33:09] from 1 Peter 48 and above all things
[33:11] have fervent charity among yourselves
[33:14] for charity shall cover a multitude of
[33:17] sins Colossians 3 and above all these
[33:20] things put on charity which is the bond
[33:22] of perfectness amen and where we got
[33:25] that inspiration from uh it was God that
[33:28] 2 Corinthians 5 it was God personally
[33:31] present in Christ reconciling and
[33:33] restoring the world to favor with
[33:35] himself not counting up and holding
[33:38] against men their trespasses but
[33:41] canceling them and committing to us the
[33:43] message of reconciliation or restoration
[33:46] to favor amen so God purpose this
[33:48] morning is that each one of you will be
[33:51] restored into favor with God that's why
[33:54] we are here we are here to be restored
[33:57] Hallelujah into favor with God when man
[34:01] fell we fell out of favor with God and
[34:04] God put angels to guard the tree in the
[34:06] Garden of Eden that man in that Fallen
[34:08] condition wouldn't partake of that tree
[34:10] of life isn't that right but when Jesus
[34:13] came he bring bring the connection it
[34:16] come like your phone get cut and what
[34:18] Jesus came he come to restore the phone
[34:20] line amen that you could have access to
[34:22] your father amen so when he died he paid
[34:25] a price to reconnect you amen into
[34:27] heaven L places to reconnect you into
[34:30] your sunship into your godship to
[34:32] reconnect you with your inheritance
[34:33] because Adam lost it Adam forfeited it
[34:36] and God want to reconnect his people
[34:38] because it belongs to you the devil
[34:40] can't own it his hand is too greasy and
[34:43] filthy to own this inheritance it
[34:46] belongs to our the sons of God so we
[34:50] have to come to a place to recognize
[34:51] what is our Redemptive rights because
[34:53] the devil can't interfere with it and
[34:55] you can't partake of it if you don't
[34:57] know it's yours
[34:58] that is given for you and you have a
[35:00] right to it glory to God how many
[35:03] understand that now oh glory to God so
[35:06] the devil he is only jealous because he
[35:08] cannot possess what it belongs to you he
[35:11] cannot ever inherited it because the
[35:13] book that Adam had he went back in the
[35:16] hands of the original owner Satan was
[35:18] Wai to catch the book because he saw the
[35:20] book slipping out of Adam's hand that
[35:22] was the objective to take away the book
[35:24] of redemption but it was sealed the
[35:27] mystery of it seal so when the devil
[35:29] looking to get the deed to take over the
[35:32] Earth it went back in the hands of the
[35:34] original owner waiting for the cry to
[35:37] come out who is
[35:39] worthy to take the book and to loose the
[35:43] Seven Seals there oh glory god and John

[1:05:10] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[1:05:13] love in this was manifested the love of
[1:05:16] God towards us because that God sent his
[1:05:19] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:05:21] might live through him hearing his love
[1:05:24] not that we love God but that he loved
[1:05:26] us sent his son to be a pretation for
[1:05:29] our sins beloved if God so love us we
[1:05:32] ought also to love one another no man

[1:05:37] another God dwelleth in USU and his love
[1:05:40] is perfected in US hereby know we that
[1:05:43] we dwell in him and he in us because he
[1:05:46] had given us of his Spirit verse 16 and
[1:05:49] we not have known and believe the love
[1:05:52] that God had to us God is love he that
[1:05:55] dwelleth in love
[1:05:56] dwelleth in God and God in him there's
[1:05:59] the last scripture I have
[1:06:01] here hearing is our love made perfect
[1:06:04] amen that we may have boldness in the
[1:06:06] day of judgment because as he is so are
[1:06:09] we in this world there is no fear in
[1:06:13] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:06:18] because fear had torment he that fearth
[1:06:21] is not made perfect Hallelujah in love
[1:06:24] hallelujah what is he saying as you walk
[1:06:26] towards love you get less
[1:06:30] fear Hall follow after charity as you

[1:06:38] failure the fear of Fallen the fear of
[1:06:41] mistakes all of that be to dissolve

[1:06:47] God nothing could hurt you or harm you
[1:06:49] because you're in the will Hallelujah of
[1:06:52] God he that fear it is not made perfect
[1:06:54] in love with love him because he first
[1:06:56] love us if a man say I love God and
[1:06:59] hated his brother he's a liar for he had
[1:07:02] he had that loveth not his brother whom
[1:07:04] he had seen how can you love God whom he
[1:07:07] had not seen all right amen all right
[1:07:10] amen and this commandment have read from
[1:07:12] him that he who love God love his
[1:07:14] brother also oh praise God do you love
[1:07:17] the Lord this morning
[1:07:20] praise the Lord hall hallelujah hallah
[1:07:25] Hallelujah Jesus for a message Called
[1:07:27] Love brother brandom I say this tonight
[1:07:29] as a minister of the gospel I've tried I
[1:07:32] have had the privilege of preaching
[1:07:33] around the world before tens of
[1:07:35] thousands of people and every Divine
[1:07:37] promise in the Bible is true and if you
[1:07:39] take the right mental attitude towards
[1:07:41] any of God's Divine promises it will
[1:07:43] bring it to pass amen if you can take
[1:07:45] the right attitude our scripture tonight
[1:07:48] is God so love the world and if there's
[1:07:50] anything that the world is dying for
[1:07:52] today is love in my travels I find that
[1:07:55] it's the rejected stone that keeps the
[1:07:58] building from being fit together where
[1:08:01] the assemblies in the Church of God the
[1:08:03] Baptist methodists will shake hands and
[1:08:05] be brothers if they just had love one
[1:08:08] for another that is the great need the
[1:08:10] world is dying for and God is love and
[1:08:13] you find the church that what's hindered
[1:08:15] the church has been a wrong conception
[1:08:17] of Love Now love there are two different
[1:08:20] types of love that's real love one of
[1:08:22] them is the Greek word called agapo
[1:08:23] that's God's love and there's a Ed love
[1:08:26] called filio love which is human love
[1:08:28] filio comes from the word Fellowship the
[1:08:30] filio love is what you have for your
[1:08:32] wife a man might flirt with her or
[1:08:34] insult her you will shoot his brains out
[1:08:36] over her that's what fil your love will
[1:08:38] do it accompanies jealousy and many
[1:08:40] other things goes with it but a gapo
[1:08:42] love will make you pray for his sinful
[1:08:44] Soul that's the difference between the
[1:08:46] two loves God's love is the beginning of
[1:08:49] love it's the function of love and the
[1:08:51] church today is lacking in that that
[1:08:53] real agapo love that makes you have love
[1:08:56] for your enemy and if we only had that
[1:08:59] kind of a love there'll be a Revival
[1:09:01] sweep this nation from coast to coast
[1:09:04] from north to south and the reason that
[1:09:07] we do not have that love the main reason
[1:09:10] the church is not progressing like it
[1:09:12] should we don't need theology we need
[1:09:15] Rel love to go with theology we already
[1:09:19] know hallelujah hallelujah we don't need
[1:09:22] another Doctrine we don't need another
[1:09:24] mystery we had them for 40 plus years
[1:09:28] what we need is the spirit Hallelujah
[1:09:30] love Dynamics the Holy Ghost charity
[1:09:35] love divine to come upon what you
[1:09:37] already know hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:40] hallelujah we only need love we love to
[1:09:42] go with the theology we already know we
[1:09:44] all argue so much whether we should be
[1:09:46] baptized forward backwards whatever more
[1:09:48] but that don't make any difference how
[1:09:50] you're baptized or what church you
[1:09:51] belong to or what evidence that you have
[1:09:54] that you're a Christian if you haven't
[1:09:55] got love you haven't got God we need
[1:09:58] love God so loved the world that he gave
[1:10:00] his only begotten son now when love is
[1:10:02] projected and come to its end soving
[1:10:05] Grace produced to
[1:10:06] project that love projected oh praise

[1:20:17] him or anyway and he Supernatural he was
[1:20:20] out of fellowship and when the church
[1:20:22] gets out of fellowship with God Miracle
[1:20:24] cease
[1:20:25] signs of w cease Revival cease just
[1:20:28] moves right out when when you get out of
[1:20:31] Fellowship oh so he said the bride has

[1:20:48] while the love of God in your heart keep
[1:20:51] fellowshipping with him and he will add
[1:20:54] these other things just as we mature
[1:20:59] Hallelujah that's very important

[1:21:03] the Bap Holy Ghost and say shall I ask
[1:21:05] God for gifts he said and become a stuff
[1:21:09] shirt because that's what people do they
[1:21:11] get a little blessing they get puffed up
[1:21:13] so he said no don't do that let the Lord
[1:21:14] lead you and different thing like that
[1:21:16] so watch I keep fellowship with him and
[1:21:19] he will add these things other things
[1:21:22] just as we mature don't you think so so
[1:21:25] so Moses was out of Fellowship no
[1:21:28] Fellowship dear what Hallelujah no

[1:21:37] Ethiopians and he was a Jew completely
[1:21:40] out of the reach of God

[1:22:02] message
[1:22:05] God will straighten it
[1:22:08] out Moses was 40 years under
[1:22:11] silence normal living and God waiting
[1:22:14] for his time to reconnect back Moses to
[1:22:18] his commission and purpose nothing could
[1:22:21] stop it not his backsliding not his
[1:22:24] running nothing could stop it and your
[1:22:26] backsliding and running that ain't going
[1:22:27] to stop it this happened that happened
[1:22:29] that ain't going to stop it the purpose

[1:34:19] people say I won't have no more to do
[1:34:21] with him and something happened to that
[1:34:23] man it nearly kills him oh God I let my
[1:34:26] precious brother go without making
[1:34:27] friends with him see his Brotherly Love
[1:34:29] here we go it looks like it won't stick
[1:34:32] but it does stick the honey it
[1:34:36] sticks real
[1:34:39] honey it have the fast food honey you
[1:34:41] know just sticking at all it's just a
[1:34:43] fasting a temporary temporary thing so
[1:34:46] each age each one of these age had that
[1:34:49] rock confession and brother I'm talking
[1:34:51] about uh the SL sleeping waiting wait
[1:34:53] waiting waiting see until this age but
[1:34:56] soon the Holy Ghost being poured out
[1:34:58] from Christ will come and seal at the
[1:34:59] church then the church will be raptured
[1:35:02] it'll be a complete unit of the Lord God
[1:35:04] hallelujah oh Hallelujah could you take
[1:35:07] some more Hall the other night I made a
[1:35:10] statement at the pulpit saying this that
[1:35:12] I would rather see Brotherly Love
[1:35:13] existing among the church if we didn't
[1:35:15] have one case of Divine Healing or
[1:35:17] anything else we must know what these
[1:35:19] things are for I rather have a church
[1:35:21] listen just a moment I would rather have
[1:35:24] a church that knows nothing about
[1:35:25] spiritual gift and just be so in love
[1:35:27] with each other and with
[1:35:29] Christ I'd rather have that than every
[1:35:33] spiritual gift operating in the church
[1:35:35] now I know that my song Hard in a
[1:35:37] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:35:39] have it where there is gifts they would
[1:35:41] fail where there is gifts they'll be
[1:35:43] conf bring confusion where there is
[1:35:45] gifts they can be questioned but where
[1:35:47] there is love it's perfect amen
[1:35:51] hallelujah that's right so if you are
[1:35:53] per perfect love you'll have perfect
[1:35:54] gifts that's right so work first with
[1:35:58] love that brings
[1:36:03] fellowship and fellowship brings gifts
[1:36:06] Hallelujah so when people push off the
[1:36:09] switch and W in the darkness there's no
[1:36:11] Fellowship it is evidence there is no
[1:36:13] love because you don't have to agree
[1:36:15] with me to fellowship with
[1:36:18] me we don't have to believe the same
[1:36:20] thing for you to be a friend with me
[1:36:22] there are people evil to toward each
[1:36:24] other in church but they're talking to
[1:36:26] unbeliever in their job they're talking
[1:36:28] to people they don't know they will go
[1:36:30] and eat dinner with them they will go
[1:36:32] and have fellowship with them and that
[1:36:33] is not a problem but they have a big
[1:36:36] problem to repent and repent and to
[1:36:38] somebody that they offend in church
[1:36:46] Hallelujah whether you say H or not that
[1:36:49] doesn't bother me I cannot proof that
[1:36:51] long time I I don't that don't but
[1:36:55] whether you say Amen or not as long as
[1:36:57] I'm speaking what I believe God lay upon
[1:36:58] my heart that's it whether you face hard
[1:37:01] what say don't don't say that doesn't
[1:37:03] matter I'll say it still that's just how
[1:37:06] I am
[1:37:07] built I get to know how I am built just
[1:37:10] have to bring the word and just slam it
[1:37:12] in Hallelujah the bride just eat it all
[1:37:14] up because she loves her husband her
[1:37:18] mate the revealed word so once they're
[1:37:21] hearing the revealed word they say
[1:37:22] that's mine that's mine come on preacher
[1:37:23] give it to me give it to me go hold back
[1:37:25] give it to me I don't want to hear a
[1:37:27] dream like you had last night no give it
[1:37:29] to dream you would like to know what a
[1:37:30] dream last

[1:59:31] God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person
[1:59:35] of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the
[1:59:38] true baptism of the Holy Ghost when you
[1:59:41] get all these virtues sealed in you then
[1:59:43] God lives in a tabernacle called the
[1:59:45] building the living Tabernacle of the
[1:59:47] living God's dwelling place and when a
[1:59:49] man possesses these things then the Holy
[1:59:52] Ghost comes upon him no matter you might
[1:59:55] speak with tongues no matter in person
[1:59:57] gift but you still might do that but
[1:59:59] until these virtues go into you you are
[2:00:01] still off the real true foundation of
[2:00:03] faith and then these virtues grow in and
