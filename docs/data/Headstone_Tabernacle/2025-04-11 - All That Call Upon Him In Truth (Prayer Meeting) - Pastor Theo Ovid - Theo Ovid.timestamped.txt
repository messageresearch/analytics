[14:22] Amen. Amen. Even Anthony, God bless you
[14:25] and thank all of you to be here tonight.
[14:28] Let us bow our heads for a word of
[14:30] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[14:32] for your presence and thank you for this
[14:34] opportunity that we could come and call
[14:35] upon your name. You have blessed us. You
[14:38] have help us along this life's journey
[14:40] and I pray keep and preserve your
[14:42] children. Lord may anointing come down
[14:44] tonight in a special way. Inspire the
[14:46] exaltation, inspire your word to your
[14:48] people that it may have an effect upon
[14:51] their lives that they wouldn't leave the
[14:52] same way that they came into this room
[14:55] but they leave you changed. They leave
[14:57] you different. Grant it Lord in Jesus
[14:59] name I ask it. Amen and amen. So it's
[15:03] good to be here tonight
[15:06] and I want to say that you know of a
[15:11] truth we have no continuing city but we
[15:15] seek one to
[15:16] come. There is no permanent ground.
[15:19] There is no you know like you cut the
[15:23] grass the grass will go back again. You
[15:26] put a roof on a roof and roof will get
[15:29] rusty. It will fade.
[15:32] Everything is have to be repaired, have
[15:33] to be redone, have to be
[15:36] recharged. This
[15:37] is what we have here in
[15:40] time. And even our energy, our strength
[15:44] is not permanent. Everything is
[15:47] temporary. So this journey of life is is
[15:51] temporary. We really don't have our city
[15:55] here. And we have an opportunity to to
[15:59] serve the Lord to to to surrender to him
[16:02] to give over to him. And I remember one
[16:05] time sharing with you how the devil
[16:08] shifts the goalpost. One time if you get
[16:11] this, you'll be happy. And when you get
[16:14] that, you're still not happy. And I keep
[16:15] shifting shifting just you you know you
[16:18] you want to achieve this and when you do
[16:19] achieve it you're still not satisfied
[16:23] because that satisfaction that each one
[16:26] of us has to have that comes from God
[16:29] that void in our hearts that come from
[16:31] God you you you you want to get a
[16:34] husband go get your husband you want
[16:35] children and then you know you get
[16:37] children then you find it's problematic
[16:40] it's challenging and whatnot and life is
[16:42] just like that some don't want this,
[16:45] don't want that, and life spins some
[16:47] balls that you wasn't expect, wasn't
[16:49] looking for, and it comes your way. So,
[16:52] I pray that God help us tonight.
[16:54] Strengthen us tonight. Stop looking for
[16:56] destination. If you are a destination
[16:58] type person, waiting until you reach
[17:00] something to praise God, reach something
[17:02] to do. But I want you to be a Christian
[17:06] that enjoys your journey. Whether it's
[17:09] up the mountain, whether it's down the
[17:11] valley, whatever challenge come your
[17:13] way, you could say safely the Lord give
[17:16] the Lord take it away. Blessed be the
[17:18] name of the Lord. None of us here
[17:19] tonight expected where we are in terms
[17:21] of this thing called the journey of
[17:24] life. But it is what it is. We are
[17:27] consoled by his word. Romans 8:28, we
[17:30] know that all things will work together
[17:31] for good to them that love God. That's
[17:33] our confirmation that we love God and
[17:35] God will make it work out well. He knows
[17:38] what's in our hearts, in our lives. And
[17:39] he know what to take out of us. He know
[17:41] what he want to teach us and what we
[17:43] need to see. So tonight, I have
[17:45] something that I'd like to share with
[17:46] you. I've titled it all that call upon
[17:50] him in truth. And you see where I get it
[17:54] from. A scripture Acts 17 verse
[17:58] 22-28. This is
[18:01] Paul and Acts 17:22. Then Paul stood in
[18:06] the midst of Marcel and said, "Ye men of
[18:08] attent, I perceive that in all things
[18:11] you are too superstitious. For as I
[18:14] passed by and beheld your devotions, I
[18:18] found an altar with this inscription to
[18:21] the unknown God, whom therefore ye
[18:25] ignorantly
[18:27] worship." Listen to these words now.
[18:29] Him declare I unto you. God that made
[18:34] the world and all things therein, seeing
[18:37] he is the Lord of heaven and earth,
[18:39] dwelleth in temples made with hands.
[18:42] Neither is worshiped with men's hands,
[18:45] as though he needed anything. See, here
[18:48] he giveth to all life and breath and all
[18:52] things, and had made us of one blood all
[18:55] nations of men for to dwell on the face
[18:57] of the earth. and have determined the
[19:00] times before appointed and the bounds of
[19:04] their
[19:05] habitation. Verse 27, did I get it from
[19:08] here? That they should seek the
[19:12] Lord if happily
[19:15] they might feel after
[19:18] him and find him, though he be not far
[19:23] from every one of us. For in him we live
[19:28] and move and have our being as certain
[19:32] also of your own poets have said for we
[19:35] are also his offspring. This is verse 27
[19:39] is the context that I have but I'll get
[19:41] to the scripture where I get the title
[19:42] from. Verse 27 says, "And they that they
[19:45] should seek the Lord if happily they
[19:48] might feel after him and find him,
[19:52] though he be not far from every one of
[19:54] us." Psalms
[19:57] 145, I want to read from verse 14 to 21
[20:01] of Psalms 145. The Lord upholdeth all
[20:06] that
[20:07] fall and raiseth up all those he that be
[20:10] bowed down.
[20:13] The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou
[20:16] givest them their meat in due season.
[20:19] Thou openest thine hand, and satisfy the
[20:22] desire of every living thing. The Lord
[20:24] is righteous in all his ways, and holy
[20:27] in all his works. The Lord is, here we
[20:31] go, nigh unto all them that call upon
[20:35] him, to all that call upon him in truth.
[20:40] He will fulfill the desire of them that
[20:41] fear him. He also will hear their cry
[20:45] and will save them. The Lord preserveth
[20:49] all them that love him, but the wicked
[20:52] will destroy. My mouth shall speak the
[20:55] praise of the Lord. Let all flesh bless
[20:58] his holy name forever and ever. Amen. So
[21:02] that is what we want to share the
[21:03] scripture and let's continue. for the
[21:08] brand. He said, "Now we read in the old
[21:11] prophets of old. We read about the power
[21:12] of God and how it operated the church."
[21:15] Tonight, friend, here that is lukewarm.
[21:18] That's not to where you should be in
[21:20] Christ. The great glorious powers of God
[21:23] is ruling and reigning in his church.
[21:25] Again, don't you be the one that's
[21:27] behind. Do not try to be popular with
[21:30] the world and right with God because you
[21:33] can't be. You must be right with God and
[21:38] then you are not popular with the world
[21:40] in this day that we are listening. Seek
[21:42] God with all your heart. Call upon him
[21:45] while it is time to call while you have
[21:48] a chance of repentance and while the
[21:51] mercy of God is reached down to you. For
[21:54] the hour is coming when it will do no
[21:56] good to call to be told it then call
[21:59] now. And this connects with something
[22:02] that brother Gideon shared on Wednesday
[22:05] night about doing it now. Seeking the
[22:08] Lord now, holding upon him now. So
[22:11] watch. He says that the time to call
[22:14] while you have a chance to repentance
[22:16] while the mercy of God is reached down
[22:18] to you for the hour is coming prophecy
[22:21] that it will do no good to call it be
[22:23] told you dead. So he was talking about
[22:27] but when they from second ro when he
[22:29] come down to the Jordan to face the
[22:31] critical world what did he cry where is
[22:34] the God of Elijah it wasn't the robe of
[22:36] Elijah that done it was the power of the
[22:39] God of Elijah that did it and the thing
[22:41] the world needs this morning is the
[22:43] power of the God of Elijah you might
[22:46] have spoke with tongues shouted run over
[22:48] the floor but what we need is the power
[22:50] of the God of Pentecost to produce the
[22:53] lies and things that was lived in the
[22:56] day in the apostolic hour. A
[22:58] secondhanded robe was all right, but he
[23:00] needed a fresh call in his heart from
[23:03] God. He needed a fresh anointed from
[23:05] God. He wore secondhanded robe when he
[23:09] come to the river, but he needed a brand
[23:12] new firsthand call from God, a firsthand
[23:15] power from God to perform the miracle.
[23:19] Now listen to these words now. And my
[23:22] brother, don't you be afraid to ask God
[23:27] anything. Hear me again. Hear these
[23:30] words. My brother, don't you be afraid
[23:34] to ask God anything. You must demand God
[23:40] or ask God for anything that he
[23:44] promised. For if I am introducing a God
[23:48] that is omnipotent and all powerful, and
[23:51] if I be a servant of God, I must do the
[23:56] works of God. And if I do the works of
[23:59] God, I must be a man of God to bring
[24:03] these things to pass because he is
[24:05] demanding of me to produce the
[24:08] impossible. I have to ask him. I have to
[24:12] call upon him and stand there and say
[24:16] God you promise it. So do you every
[24:21] person this is incredible but Brandon is
[24:24] saying he is demanding of me to produce
[24:28] the impossible. I have to ask him. I
[24:32] have to call upon him and stand there
[24:36] and say God you promise it. So do you
[24:41] every person you shall receive power
[24:44] acts 18 after the Holy Spirit come upon
[24:46] you after the Holy Spirit come upon you
[24:49] after you are robed as a Christian after
[24:52] your faith is set in Christ then you
[24:55] shall receive power there you are now
[24:58] brother sister everyone that's this
[25:00] morning may I say this before praying
[25:02] for the sick may I say this by God's
[25:04] help you pray for me I stood 10
[25:07] years ago on this practice form
[25:09] preaching on David and Goliath. Now, it
[25:12] isn't that Goliath that's hindered me.
[25:15] Listen to these words. It isn't that
[25:17] Golad that's hindered me. God has slain
[25:20] him before me. But the thing that is
[25:22] hindering me is the lack of
[25:25] faith. This is the prophet
[25:28] speaking. The thing that is hindering me
[25:31] is the lack of faith. The lack of
[25:34] something that I know was around. And
[25:38] this morning before this little
[25:40] tabernacle again, I'm screaming, "Where
[25:43] is the God who give this promise? Where
[25:45] is the God who met with us yonder? Come
[25:48] forward, God. Give me courage. Give me
[25:52] strength. Give me a determined mind.
[25:55] Regardless of what comes or goes,
[25:57] whether it looks dark, whether it looks
[26:00] good, whatever it looks like, move on.
[26:03] Your promise is true." Amen. Isn't that
[26:05] wonderful tonight? So on and what the
[26:08] holy ghost given for almost done. So
[26:12] Jesus Jesus uh knowed that there'll be
[26:16] great intellectual move in this day.
[26:19] Washing up pots and pans, wearing
[26:20] clothes, turning around colors,
[26:22] everything else. He know that right? So
[26:24] he says, "Now the purpose, here we go,
[26:27] of sending the Holy Ghost was for God to
[26:31] continue through a bunch of people to
[26:34] continually manifest God to the world."
[26:37] That's exactly not by a creed, not by a
[26:41] denomination, but by the power of his
[26:44] resurrection, by making his word real,
[26:47] by taking his promise. Here we go. and
[26:49] standing on the side of the minority and
[26:52] believing God and watch the black skies
[26:56] move back and the power of God moving
[26:58] and take over. That is what he wants.
[27:01] That is what the Holy Ghost was sent
[27:04] for. That was the purpose he sent it
[27:07] for. Psalms 142 we read David was in the
[27:11] cave and David said this. I cried unto
[27:15] the Lord with my voice. So this is not
[27:17] no mental praying and praying is mine.
[27:19] No, I cried unto the Lord with my voice.
[27:22] With my voice unto the Lord did I make
[27:25] my
[27:26] supplication. I poured out my complaint
[27:30] before him. I showed before him my
[27:33] trouble. And when my spirit was
[27:35] overwhelmed within me, then thou knest
[27:38] my path. In the way wherein I have
[27:40] walked of the privileged leaders near
[27:42] for me. I look on my right hand and
[27:45] beheld there was no man that would know
[27:48] me. Refuge fill me. No man cared for my
[27:53] soul. I cried unto thee, O Lord. I said
[27:57] thou at my refuge and my portion in the
[28:00] land of the living. Attend unto my cry
[28:03] for I am brought very low. Deliver me
[28:07] from my persecutions, for they are
[28:09] stronger than I. Look how sincere, look
[28:13] how honest, look how truthful David is
[28:16] praying. He is not speaking with
[28:18] eloquence. He's not using fancy words.
[28:21] He is praying to God. He said, "Attend
[28:24] unto my cry, for I am brought very low.
[28:28] Deliver me from my persecutors, for they
[28:31] are stronger than I. Bring my soul out
[28:35] of prison that I may praise thy name.
[28:38] The righteous shall compass me about and
[28:41] thou shalt be bountiful with me. We want
[28:44] you to pray like that. So I wrote some
[28:46] things here. Cry unto the Lord. Whether
[28:49] in sickness, in fear, in worries, in
[28:53] hurts, in danger, regardless of of your
[28:57] soul condition, don't hesitate to call
[29:00] upon God. But call upon him in truth.
[29:04] Submit yourself to him. God is not
[29:07] interested in fancy prayers or words.
[29:09] Don't cry for help, but trust in human
[29:11] intelligence and the ability to get you
[29:14] out. John 4:24, God is a spirit, and
[29:19] they that worship him must worship him
[29:22] in spirit and in truth. It must have
[29:26] spirit and truth. Psalms
[29:30] 138:68, "Though the Lord is
[29:33] high, yet he respect unto the lowly, but
[29:37] the proud, he knoweth a far off. Though
[29:40] I walk in the midst of trouble, thou
[29:42] will provide me." So David is not
[29:47] negging himself, talking negative to
[29:49] himself. He's saying, "Do I walk in the
[29:51] midst of trouble, thou will revive me.
[29:55] Do thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[29:58] against the wrath of my enemies and thy
[30:00] right hand shall save me. Note David is
[30:04] confessing his dependency upon God. He
[30:08] is not talking about my men will save me
[30:11] or my my my my generals and my said no
[30:14] no no he said thy right hand shall save
[30:16] me. Then he said these words the Lord
[30:19] will perfect that which concernth me.
[30:23] Thy mercy, oh Lord, endureth forever.
[30:26] Forsake not the work of thine own hands.
[30:30] So listen as we
[30:32] close. God is near to those who are
[30:36] seeking him. And that's where we get
[30:38] Acts 17. That they should seek the Lord
[30:42] if happy they might feel after him and
[30:45] find him. Here's what though he be not
[30:48] far from every one of us. So I want to
[30:51] say tonight, he's not far from from any
[30:54] one of us. Psalms 145:18, the Lord is
[30:58] nigh unto all them that call upon him.
[31:03] And this come after what? The next line,
[31:06] the qualifying part to all that call
[31:10] upon him in truth. So this scripture
[31:13] Psalms 114:5 brought a division.
[31:17] You could say you call upon him, but
[31:19] then it says to call upon him in truth
[31:23] because you could call upon God in
[31:24] hypocrisy. You could call upon God, but
[31:27] you're still looking for some kind of
[31:29] cement, some kind of something else to
[31:31] work for you. That is not the truth. So
[31:35] you could call upon God and you have a
[31:37] hidden agenda. You have a hidden motive,
[31:39] hidden objective. God doesn't want that.
[31:42] And I have time. I want to read this. I
[31:44] think I'll read this. read this years
[31:46] ago. I think I want to read this again,
[31:48] but Abraham had a vision of this black
[31:50] snake, the African mambber snake, and
[31:53] this thing kills. Okay, once it attack
[31:55] you, hit you, it kills you. And he says
[31:57] this now, he look at angry at me, licked
[31:59] his tongue. Here he come. But when he
[32:02] got right close to me, this is a snake
[32:04] now. He'd run up fast and when he gets
[32:06] and then slower, slower, just quiver and
[32:08] stop. And then something would hold him
[32:11] off. He couldn't bite me. He turn around
[32:14] on the other side, try to approach from
[32:16] this side. So this snake taking one side
[32:18] approach and we taking every side he
[32:21] could take to see how he could attack.
[32:23] He would get back, get a start, swish
[32:25] right towards me, get slower, slower,
[32:27] and then stop and just shake like that
[32:30] and move back. He couldn't strike me.
[32:32] Then he turn and look at my friend. Here
[32:33] we go. This is the partner.
[32:36] So he turned and look at my friend and
[32:40] away he went after my friend. And I see
[32:44] my friend just jumping way in the air
[32:46] and over him and over him and over him
[32:49] trying. The thing was striking at him. I
[32:51] thought, "Oh, if it ever hits him, it
[32:53] will be instant death. No wonder
[32:56] everybody is so scared." Cuz when this
[32:58] thing hits you, it's instant death. And
[33:01] it was just striking at him like that.
[33:03] And I threw my hands up. I said, "Oh,
[33:05] God, have mercy upon my brother." And he
[33:07] said, "If that serpent ever strikes him,
[33:09] it will kill him." And just then the
[33:13] serpent turned to me when I said that.
[33:16] Wow. And look at me again. And a voice
[33:20] came from above me and said, "You have
[33:23] been given
[33:24] power to bind him the worst or any." So,
[33:30] so this is very dramatic. It was trying
[33:33] to get to him. The same the snake slow
[33:36] down and stopped. He recognized he
[33:38] cannot bite brother Brandham or hurt
[33:40] brother Bam. But see the same thing but
[33:43] then it take off after his friend. But
[33:45] Abraham with a voice said, "God have
[33:47] mercy. If the snake ever strike it,
[33:50] strike him, he will kill him." The snake
[33:52] turn
[33:53] around. And then the voice said, "You
[33:56] have been given power." I said, "Well,
[33:58] God, what must I do?"
[34:02] He
[34:03] said, "There is one thing you must do.
[34:08] You must be more
[34:10] sincere. You must be more sincere." I
[34:13] said, "Well, God, forgive
[34:16] me for my
[34:19] insincerity and let me have sincerity."
[34:22] And when I raised up my hands to him
[34:24] again, there was a great something came
[34:28] over me.
[34:30] just lifted me up. Seemed like my whole
[34:34] body was charged with something. So now
[34:37] the anointing has struck him. He's feel
[34:40] a charge of the Holy Ghost, a charge of
[34:43] the power of God. I look at this serpent
[34:45] and when he started to watch me and
[34:48] couldn't do it, yet I said, "Satan, in
[34:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[34:53] bind you." So he knew the snake couldn't
[34:57] get to him, but he spoke these word.
[35:00] Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:02] Christ, I I knew. And the serpent, a
[35:05] blue smoke flow to him, and he curled up
[35:09] and made a sign like a S, capital S made
[35:12] backwards, a and sign, and means and
[35:15] means bind this one or anything below
[35:18] him because he was the worst. Blue smoke
[35:20] fell out of him. His tail choked his own
[35:23] self to death around his head. And when
[35:25] he made the backward s and sign like a
[35:29] conjunction, the brother was
[35:31] free. Now he went over and smashed on
[35:34] it. I said, "Now I've got to find out
[35:36] about this because it's a vision." I hit
[35:39] on the thing. It turned like it looked
[35:42] like a handle on a glass handle on a
[35:44] picture. It made of solid crystal. Think
[35:47] of that. How quick that blue smoke was
[35:50] life and everything that left it and all
[35:52] the elements turned to glass. Then a
[35:56] voice came again, you can unbind him
[35:59] also. So I said, "Then Satan, that I
[36:03] might know, I unbind you." And when it
[36:05] did, he started coming to life again
[36:07] wiggling. I said, "I you back in the
[36:09] name of Jesus Christ." And when it did,
[36:12] the smoke flew out of him again. He
[36:14] choked himself right back and turned to
[36:16] crystal. Then when he did that, the
[36:19] voice said,
[36:20] "No, you must be more sincere than what
[36:24] you are to do this." Then it left me. I
[36:28] was standing in the room. A few moments
[36:31] I hear a clock go off, my wife getting
[36:32] up, the children, and I skip. So I
[36:35] slipped into the den room. I got on my
[36:37] knees. I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know
[36:40] these things. What must I do? The turner
[36:43] will be calling me to take them to
[36:45] school in a few moments. What must I do?
[36:47] I look around and my Bible was laying
[36:50] there. I said, "Lord, if you will
[36:51] forgive me, I do not believe in just
[36:53] opening the scripture and taking
[36:55] something out of the Bible saying that,
[36:57] but there is times when God can comfort
[37:00] you by such a thing." I said, "Lord, in
[37:02] this case of emergency right now, before
[37:04] your spirit leaves me, I don't know what
[37:07] to do. The kids will be in an hour yet
[37:09] before they come on. Would you show me
[37:12] if that is there? something you're
[37:13] trying to get to me, heavenly father,
[37:15] and just let me know. And I took the
[37:18] Bible, pull it open like that, and my
[37:20] thumb was laying on first Corinthians
[37:23] the 5th chapter, the 8th verse. Then
[37:26] something reads something like this.
[37:28] When you come, I was planning to take a
[37:31] fast to the Lord. I told him, I go out
[37:33] and fast. He said, when you come to the
[37:35] feast, which is a fast in the body, is a
[37:36] feast with the Lord. We know that. So
[37:38] when you come to this feast, don't come
[37:41] with the old leaven or leaven of malice
[37:43] and so forth, but come with the
[37:47] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[37:51] That's exactly what he had told me in
[37:53] the vision. God is my solemn judge. Come
[37:57] with the unleaven bread of sincerity and
[38:00] truth. That is the word. Then I seen
[38:02] what he mean. So the scripture is 1
[38:04] Corinthians 5:8. Therefore, let us keep
[38:07] the feast, not with old leaven, neither
[38:10] with the leaven of malice and
[38:12] wickedness, but with the unleaven bread
[38:15] of sincerity and truth. So, this is what
[38:18] I had in my heart to share with you.
[38:20] Praise God this tonight. That praise all
[38:24] that call upon him in truth. There are
[38:27] many people calling upon
[38:28] God, but there are different heart
[38:31] condition. That is why many of times the
[38:34] prayer even is not even answered because
[38:36] of that heart condition and the high and
[38:40] lofty one that dwell with him that of a
[38:43] contrite heart and a broken spirit. That
[38:46] is how God wants us tonight in all
[38:49] humility, surrendered, yielding to him,
[38:52] pouring out our souls to him, sharing
[38:55] with him what we need, have need of. So
[38:58] may the Lord bless you as they get on in
[39:00] prayer by God's grace. God be with you.
[39:02] Praise the Lord.
