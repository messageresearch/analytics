let's bow our heads forward a prayer heavenly father I pray that your spirit would come and take a hold upon us we are living in troubless times we living in Bible times we are living in times of fulfillment of prophecies we are living in time that the sages and of the ages look forward for this hour Daniel himself saw a stone cut up without the hands of man we live in in such a Time father God to our hearts tonight our spirits tonight by Your Word Shake us out of lgy complacency negativity flesh God and bring us into the spirit that you could speak to us we need to hear from you tonight and may the spirit of prayer and supplication poured upon your people in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you welcome so excuse me glad to be here tonight and um before I read the scripture I have a word here to Trav your mind word called complacency that word is a feeling of calm satisfaction with your own abilities or situation that prevents you from trying harder so that is when somebody feeling real cool everything is fine they okay Daniel 9 want to look at some scriptures here night and the title I have of this exaltation to you is that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth I extract that out of the text that we're going to read to here tonight Daniel 9 1-22 in the first year of darus the son of Asus the seed of the mes which were made King over the realm of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I refer to this in my from the pastor's desk concering this time of prayer and fast verse three and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sa and ases now bread to us is like the stuff of Life man shall bread alone bread is what we feed on or food and that would give us the energy so when you and I when we make a sacrifice to turn on the putt it means something to God that's how it should be so Daniel said I set my face unto the Lord to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting sa Andes and I prayed on the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keep the Covenant and mercy keep in the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned not we are fine not we are cool being the bride we have sinned and have committed iniquity have done Wicked and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have weened unto thy servants the prophets which speak in thy name to our Kings and our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness Belong To Thee but unto us confusion of faces as of this day to the men of Judah to the inhabitant of Jerusalem and all Israel that are near that are far off through all the countries whether thou Hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespass against thee Oh Lord to us belong a confusion of Faith to our Kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God being belong mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obey the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before us I servant the prophet yes ye all Israel have transgressed by you even by the pon that they might not obey thy voice there too the curses pour out upon us so Daniel wasn't playing with words and playing games with God he knew what happened and the oat that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and he had confirmed his words which he speak against us and against our judges that judge us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole Heaven had not been done has been done upon Jerusalem and it is written in the law of Moses all this evil has come upon us yet yet made we not our prayer before the Lord Our God so when you see disaster evil wickedness things not working out for you it's time to call upon God he said and we obey not his voice verse 15 and now Lord Our God thou has brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and has gotten the renowned at this day we are sinned we have done wickedly oh Lord Accord to all thy righteousness I Bes the let th Ang and thy Fury be turned away from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain because of our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all that about us oh my God incline thine ear so you can see the fervency in Daniel here he wasn't just praying the regular Road prayer he wasn't just saying back words half tied half dead un tired it was serious because he recognized we are coming to a convergence we come to a junction coming to a whole ch beat whole rhym oh my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the situation called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee or our righteousness but for thy great mercies oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord AR and do defer not for th own sake oh my God but I C like people are called by their name and whilst I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God ye while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I've seen in a vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the even oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding oh blessed be the name of the Lord I've now come forth to give the skill on sensor tonight that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth this is what God want from us a turnning a turning from what we have been doing and our attitudes and so on and to Servant okay Deuteronomy 30 11:14 this is a very great scripture Deuteronomy 13 says for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it under to us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thine heart that thou mayest do it and this year from Deuteronomy 3014 Amplified and the word is very near you in your mouth and your mind and your heart so you can do it I don't know how much you have realized or you're watching the news Iran have sent a set of missiles over to Israel so now you have I don't know sometime ago I talk about the Psalms 83 battle the psalm 83 conglomeration and Associates of Jordan and Iran and Iraq and Saudi Arabia and the whole bunch of those Arab Nations around Israel but the flame with Hamas that has just started it's spreading it will spread and always wondered how Russia will get into it well Russia is partners with Iran so that's how Russia foot going to be in this whole thing so friends we could sit here in Trinidad and say this war doesn't concern us Ukraine or Russia uh Israel and what going on there but it would concern us it would affect us and I hope that what we share tonight would would help you but Braham and this something we keep saying over and over so many says if the Lord with take evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I will Ser him but that's up to you youve got something to do they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready you see God could not push us through a pipe pull us to the other side and then saying blessed he overcome it you had nothing to overcome you just push you through but you have got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself doing that we show our faith and respect to God by doing what making decisions whether it's our wife whether it's our husband whether it's our children whether it's our family many times we are caught up in our emotions concerning our families but do you think God is in that emotion with you you think about it once your child is past the age of accountability that child is a solidar that's how God see God don't have grandchildren God not in the emotional frame that we have to let them get away with murder and let them get away with all kind of nasty attitude with no correction with no word coming to them how could things change how could we if we don't rebuke sin if we don't bring things to people knowledge and understanding how do we give them a chance to repent how do we give them a chance to make things right so we have things to do and I believe that God blessed the service on Wednesday and but Kelly s s me a little note and was really something I was speaking and he said went and he was talking about something huge was said near the end on I said when Samson understood what was going on he began to pray and through those suckless eyes tears started to come down and he said once more he could only pray once more because he had it before that is powerful and while it was coming to me to see it I was seeing it at the same time he could only pray once more before he had it before he couldn't pray once more and he never had it and the Dynamics of this church will be refilling of the Holy Ghost that they have worked in a small measure you can't ask for what you don't know about you must give a measure God must give a measure that we can work with are you asking for that measure so so before the dynamic strike before the power strike before all what is Promised third P this that the other he promised a measure that we could work with it come like new heart new spirit his Spirit the new spirit is get along with your neighbor some some people so rotten they come to the Lord yes but snake inside their heart they s down in church for years and you try to understand why are they like that that there's a reason why they are like that they have not yet been converted have not yet been changed so I certainly appreciate that quot that nemiah 81 and this scripture was I'll just read it nemiah 81 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation of both men and women get this part and all that could here with understanding and he read therefore before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until the midday morning till midday he was reading for them before the men and women and those that could understand in know words God don't want dum dum heads God don't want people foolish and stupid and don't want to understand what going on that the Bible said be wise not fools understanding what the will of the Lord is do you know what the will of the Lord is for you do you know what the will of the Lord is and his program or you caught up in your business or your family concern or you caught up in the cares of life because that is that come to choke you you will be choked you would bring for the fruit if you allow that everybody have cares of Life everybody have challenges of life is here we are to live God put us in a mountain somewhere by ourselves where we don't encounter this and that and the other we have to go to the market we have to go to the grocery we have to pick up children we have to do this we have to do that all of that is normal living but with all of that he want us to have the antenna that actually connected to him all right here this part I want to get to and Ezra The Scribe stood up upon a Pulpit of wood which they had made for that purpose and he call some names and whatnot and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen amen lift up their hands and they bow their heads and Worship the Lord with their faces to the ground but there's the part I want to get to and the Levites caus the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so they read in the book of The Law of God distinctly and give the sense and cause them to understand the reading and that's why we keep saying over and over this message being revealed unfolded or unfolded should make things clearer and plain it shouldn't be more complex write Division and make it complex write the vision and make it mysterious no write the vision and make it plain the issue with Elohim the issue with God is that he was so mysterious he had a challenge how do I get to this people then we accustom with uncle aunt grandmother grandparents and so like that that is at the human level but remember God is not a man so he could only operate within his own laws then I got this from Brother Kelly sou he sent me a note this morning and I felt that I should use that tonight you said good morning brother ID at times I have felt that people don't pray about or for adoption the bride's Revival the line Etc because they feel that their part is simply to live a Christian Life and God will do these things in his time in other words his spirit is picking up the complacency that people have in this message where they do have to pray for adoption they do have to pray for transformation or F virtue they just live a normal Christian Life make some money buy some groceries change your car paint over the house change the roof and so on and you're good to go it's not happening so sorry that happened so but continues because they feel that part is simply to live a Christian Life and God will do these things in his time I have heard this expressed before and it Disturbed me in Reading More on Charles finny I found this powerful thing he said concerning this Frame of mine and I thought I would share it and this is what fin said there are many prophecies yet unfulfilled in the Bible which Christians are bound to understand as as far as they are capable of understanding them and then make them the basis of believing prayer love it in other words your understanding open and then you could go and effectively pray because you're not playing like a dumdum or you're praying like a Catholic or praying for somebody or you want to or on to Mary and you're done with that and you're serving a god like a god of hood or stone but no you have an understanding and that's why I read the scripture D I understood by books what Jeremiah Was talking about and I recognize time is short I recognize time is shaving down right so therefore I will act what he did he sought the Lord with prayer and fasting so let's continue as far as they capable of understanding them and then make them the basis of believe and prayer do not think as some seem to that because a thing is for told in Prophecy it is not necessary to pray for it or that it will come whether Christians pray for it or not there is no truth in this God says in regard to this very class of events which are revealed in Prophecy and he quote Ezekiel 36:37 nevertheless for all these things will I inquire of by the house of Israel to do it for them so brother Brandon said it this way that God wanted us to have a part to play so Jesus told his his disciples he said you pray to the lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into the Harvest he is the lord of the Harvest but yet he asked them to pray so it almost appears as if on Earth the weapon of warfare of prayer is more powerful than we dare admit or we need to find out the power of prevailing prayer or the power of believing prayer or the power of praying the promise because when Jesus opened the understanding to the scriptures they were commanded to go in the upper room understanding was not enough opening the word was not enough they had what was us to you and on power the so-called executive and glorious teachers in this message want to make the people believe that the teaching is all you need so you get nailed down by teaching and you sit back relax enjoy the ride sit back in complacency but that is not what brother Bram is speaking about here let's continue brother Bram is I'm recognizing message someone said the other day brother R brother Rell a precious brother of mine standing against the wall he says it was discussing in the room the other day brother Rodell was disturbed about the condition of time and the feeling of the spirit in the churches today or begin to drop down ministers coming from everywhere and interviews out here asking what has happened brother B what has happened and brother r ask me the question are they living off the spirit of Satan or what now hear this it answers so many things I said no the suckers live off the strength of the vine it lives because the citrus fruit a lemon will grow in an orange tree but it will not bear oranges though it lives by its life and the church soal only is a grafted sucker living under the same name of religion under the name of the church Catholic Protestant just suckered pulling from the strength of the vine and yet bearing the fruit of what they are because they wasn't converted let's stop right there so let's bring it to home now let's bring it to the church now let's bring it now to explain why it is people still producing their own fruit unchanged and you don't know why they are not converted they're drawing from the church they're drawing from the atmosphere they drawing from specials and singing and everything else they're going to church that's the ritual part of it but there is no transformation whatsoever they are the same person they were 20 years ago 15 years ago 100 years ago they are the same no change they don't want to change they complacent they are satisfied with themselves God have mercy brother bam says they wasn't in the original predestinated plan of God and that's the reason they have to deny the word and bear other kind of fruit the real genuine tree is in its roots was predestinated to bring for oranges on an orange tree Jesus said I am the vine we are the branches and if that tree ever puts forth another Branch it will bear the original Fruit there's got to be a restoration of all these things right at the end of the vine so if you realize that God has called you and you have a higher calling to cry out and call upon God to bear fruit you cannot let grapefruit lemon and whatever else and limes in the church hinder what you are called to do and that is why we have to disconnect from how to say it boy from people that really they're not there to encourage you along they are there to drag you and pull you because they are not in that frame of God and and and and and there's nothing we could do about it and there's a some there's a scripture about a fool you beat a fool is still a fool you can't change that you know so so so we not here to abuse and beat up people and what we want to see is who is willing enough to take this word and die take this word and surrender take this word and allow the word for you to be subjection subject to the word then in that sense butam says he says what um it will come out of the vine not a denomination that's grafted into it but a original production of the word is got to come fort and there will be light in the evening time yeah this bum you see it always have fine print when people say this stuff and you don't get the fine print to understand how do you get there you miss the whole thing it takes light to Ren it and then he said no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be Wren it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world so there has got to come forth a power this is it right here this is what we have to emphasize there's got to comfort a power de holy Strait himself to righten or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifest that what he predicted would happen in this day so here it is we have Cela um heading down into the White House Biden looking to exit right America coming to a junction war in Ukraine and Russia war in the East floods hurricanes things are shaken up and if these things not starting to shake you or get you to understand it is not business as usual but God help us I'm going to close this is astonishing scripture I bouns up here Proverbs 289 he that turn it away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be Abomination so in other words a person who don't want to listen to the word who don't want to hear the word like how Ezra to read it out to them give understanding bring Clarity that person prayer becomes an Abomination the amplifi said he who turns away his ear from hearing the law of God and man even his prayer is an Abomination hateful and revolting to God Proverbs 158 the sacrifice of the wicked is an AB of the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight I close last scripture and we finish Zechariah 7 verse 10 it says and oppress not the Widow nor the fatherless The Stranger nor the poor let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart but they refus to Heen and pull away the shoulder and stop their ears that they should not hear ye they have made their hearts as an Adam Stone least they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent in his Spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from The Lord of host therefore it has come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they cried and I would not hear sayeth the Lord of host so the conclusion is this when you refuse to hear the word of the Lord when you want to hear your prayer answered he will not hear you God have feelings God has get F God is get tired that is why God tell Samuel what happened why you still talking about Saul I had enough of him I have found a better man don't waste time I understood somebody shared with me that after the anointing left Saul Saul sat down on that tone for 38 years without the anointing of God we read the scripture about Samson on Wednesday night it is scary Samson didn't even catch that the spirit of God was no longer with him and he was just like any ordinary man wasn't Samson ability it wasn't Samson must and strength it was the spirit of God and as long as we Pummel our way in our own human spirit that going to burn out eventually that will get tired and weary we have to go in the spirit the power is might let us bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight I was so excited about sharing this tonight God help us Lord help each son and daughter here to turn from their iniquities but turn in their mind in their Spirit to reject the world and the things of the world and the attraction of the world and all the tensels that the devil have to offer in so many different ways may they see Lord how the enemy trying to get through a back door a window God help us to close all the doors when we leave our homes and houses we want to make sure everything is locked there is no entrance that we we forget to lock and then something is stolen we are robbed we are cheated God help us tonight to search our hearts help us tonight to cry out unto you and break out of Ley and break out of complacency and what amazing what brother Kelly has shared concerning phiney and and talking about prophecy and people not praying and sit back and saying well God will do it but when you prophesy to Abraham that your people will in a Strange Land and for 400 years and a mighty hand he would bring them out but then when that time Came In the Flesh when that time came in fulfillment reality they begin to cry out unto you to send a deliverer and then you came down and said I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down father wake this Israel up wake this elected up wake wake them up Lord because the enemy is at the gate just as is Israel being surrounded and being attacked by missiles so the bride will be attacked by all these thousands and thousands of demons loosed against the BR the battle is about to begin and the prophet taught us that when the supernatural Break Forth then all hell breaks loose right now people clanging sword with coats and argument which is sometime the only weapon they have debate and strife but you want to empower a bride you prophesied that there will be a church with Jesus walk in it you prophesied the shout of the king will be in the camp you prophesied that there will be a church where there will be signs and wonders and miracles that will be across the world you prophesied a Dynamic Church a glorious Church a church that will be a conquering Church undefeated a church that cannot be conquered or walking in the spirit and power of God tell of Fire by Night Cloud by day Jehovah of the old Jesus of the new Lord oh the Lord himself going everywhere with them confirming the word with signs and following oh God tonight I pray father that you heal is sick and our midst I pray father you confirm your word to the lives of your people father I pray tonight be a turning point a junction point oh God in the lives of these children here gathered before you you have no grandchildren you have sons and daughters you don't want them in ignorance you want them walking in the like Moses did what he did and kill a man and ran and he wasn't clear about his calling he wasn't cleared by the pillar of fire and by the direct call of God but when he met that burning bush it transformed him when he met that burning bush something completely changed and radicalized his entire life that he was willing to go back to a place he never thought he would go back before oh Jesus come now and do something special for your people is not what we stop so much is what you have done what you are doing and you are causing us to see by Your Word what we must do we can't sit back and say God take all this evil if God will take out this if God will take out that no we have to press we have to fight we have to wrestle oh God let that fight coming to the people tonight oh God may it be like when the walls are been rebuilt and one had had a sword and the other one had brick and mortar and some were watching and fighting and watching and laying brick let us bring back the foundation let us lay back that wall let us bring back the hedge of protection the hedge of prayer oh God may you inspire your people to get an anchor Point whether it's morning and evening or particular time of the day whether it's lunch time 10 minutes here 10 minutes there but that they will be consistent with it to know that they are talking to the Living God just as we talk to each other just as we talk to our family and friends on the phone on a daily basis we should be talking to you on a daily basis just as we communicate with others on a daily basis we should be communicating with you on a daily basis and hearing from you on a daily basis oh God May the Bible become a read book a fresh book a fresh anointing Lord I've always heard the Bible of come meanings and I'm seeing it so real now how you could take any Scripture and interpret it in someone's lives it might look like it apply to Israel but it could apply to an individual it look like it apply to Abraham but it apply to the brother this or sister this it look like apply to Joseph but it apply to brother this and sister this is your word you have the full coverage of it from alpha to Omega from the beginning to the end it is dear every answer we have need of is in the scriptures oh God may your word become flesh Among Us may we find a whole of you father may your spirit of prayer and supplication strike your people like never before touch the calebs touch those are weary and tired long in the vineyard reward them Father bless them Lord Quicken them Lord May healing virtue flow may your anointing break for in your homes May Revival fire break for in the homes and lives of the people I ask it in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you Saints thanks again for being here I trust that God would inspire you as you get on in prayer in Jesus name God bless you praise the Lord e [Music]
