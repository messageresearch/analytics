[43:06] down in defeat. But he said, "Do you
[43:11] remember
[43:13] where I brought you from?
[43:17] Just take a look behind you
[43:21] at how far you've come.
[43:25] Whenever you ask me, didn't I deliver
[43:30] you?
[43:32] Then why would you be thinking that I
[43:36] wouldn't see you through? Didn't I walk
[43:41] on the water
[43:44] and I calmed the raging sea?
[43:48] I spoke to your wind
[43:51] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[43:55] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[43:59] hear you when you're cold?
[44:03] I walked to right beside you just so you
[44:08] wouldn't fall.
[44:10] Didn't I leave all of heaven
[44:14] just to die for your sins?
[44:18] I searched until I found you. And I'll
[44:22] do it all again.

[44:44] in a house that was once a home. She
[44:47] says, "My bills are coming due, Lord.

[44:55] voice so sweet and low.
[44:58] Said, "I've done like that before.
[45:02] And I'll do this little thing, much. And
[45:06] I'll give you so much more. Didn't I
[45:10] walk on the water? And I cross the ra.

[46:19] just how much I love you.

[56:36] In the name of the Lord. Are you happy

[56:49] [Applause]
[56:51] Amen.
[56:54] Before you take your seats,
[56:56] in fact, you can have your seats.
[57:04] It is incredible that we have come to
[57:06] the final service.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And God has been good.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Has he been good?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And to think, you know, a brother said
[57:16] to me, "It's not even over yet."
[57:19] And to think that God still has more in
[57:21] store for us tonight.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; How good our God is.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; You appreciate the convention.
[57:31] We appreciate the singing, the worship,
[57:35] the ministry of the word. There's no
[57:38] convention without you. So, we really
[57:39] appreciate you for making the convention
[57:42] the convention.
[57:46] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[57:49] I have two notes of praises. One from
[57:52] Sister Elizabeth Pinkra. I thank the
[57:55] Lord for his goodness. My nephew has
[57:56] been moved from the ICU to a regular
[57:59] ward.
[58:01] [Music]
[58:04] She said, I see a cloud like a man's
[58:06] hand. Thank you, church, for your
[58:08] prayers. You know, brother said, once
[58:10] you see one sign, that's enough. We we
[58:14] just need to see one sign to know that
[58:16] it's already taken place. So, we thank
[58:18] the Lord.
[58:20] And from uh Bodan Olofin, I want to
[58:22] thank God for the great deliverance he
[58:24] bestowed to me today during the altar
[58:26] call after brother Olu's message. Now I
[58:29] can say that sin will not have dominion
[58:31] over me anymore forever. And I believe
[58:33] many can give testimony. Many can give
[58:36] witness of the service this morning. The
[58:39] service is yesterday. The service is on
[58:42] Friday. And God is still in the
[58:44] deliverance business. He is still
[58:46] breaking chains. He is still setting
[58:48] free. And I believe if you came tonight,
[58:51] God is not going to disappoint. Can the
[58:53] church say amen?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] You may be seated.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; So certainly we want to acknowledge uh
[59:03] some of the ministers that are here one
[59:04] more time. Brother Andrew Fong, we thank
[59:06] you so much for being here tonight.
[59:10] God bless you and to be here with your
[59:12] wife, Sister Green. So good to see you.
[59:14] God bless you. Our precious brother
[59:15] Green will be greeting us tonight.
[59:19] my friend, my brother, Brother Norris.
[59:21] So good to see you here with us again
[59:22] tonight.
[59:24] Brother Harry, so good to see you. And
[59:27] all the wonderful faces of the portion
[59:29] of the bride that's here that knows that
[59:31] we are the final voice at the final age.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; You know, brother said, when we get over
[59:36] there, there'll be some people over
[59:37] there who you didn't think would make
[59:39] it,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; but they're going to be there
[59:42] &gt;&gt; because their names are on the book. It
[59:44] might look like they're in trouble now,
[59:46] but they are going to be there. So it's
[59:48] so good to be among believers of like
[59:49] precious paper. We could shout, we could
[59:52] jump, we could rejoice, we could cry, we
[59:54] could sing. And it is my honor tonight
[59:57] or how many appreciate our precious
[59:58] brother Olu for the message this
[1:00:00] morning.
[1:00:02] What a word, what a message, and what a
[1:00:04] move of the spirit that followed the
[1:00:07] service that brought deliverance, great
[1:00:10] deliverance to the people of God.
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] Amen.
[1:00:17] great deliverance to the people of God.
[1:00:19] And uh tonight we have our precious
[1:00:23] brother Raymond Thompson from South
[1:00:24] Africa who will minister the word of God
[1:00:27] to us. But before he comes uh we have a
[1:00:32] greeting from our precious brother
[1:00:33] Albert Green. How many you appreciate
[1:00:35] brother Green, a real soldier in the
[1:00:38] army of the Lord. We salute our brother
[1:00:41] Green. me such an inspiration.
[1:00:43] You know, as as one of the younger one
[1:00:46] of the younger preachers, it's important
[1:00:48] for us to have ministers we could look
[1:00:50] up to and who could inspire us who run
[1:00:52] the road of the course and could find
[1:00:54] the middle of the road,
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; you know, and and it's such a blessing
[1:00:58] to see what God is doing. But I really
[1:01:00] want to salute brother Green because he
[1:01:01] walks the middle of the road
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; and he is focused on the resurrection.
[1:01:06] He's focused on the rapture. He's
[1:01:07] focused on where the bride needs to be.
[1:01:09] So, Brother Green, we salute you. We
[1:01:11] love you. We appreciate you. So, as
[1:01:14] brother Green comes to greet the people,
[1:01:17] let's just sing that song. All over the
[1:01:19] world, the spirit is moving.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; All over the world, the spirit is
[1:01:26] moving.
[1:01:28] All over the world, as the prophet

[1:02:19] Bless the Lord.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Just want to read one verse of script
[1:02:23] here and we could have our seat. And he
[1:02:26] gives some apostles
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:02:32] and some pastors
[1:02:34] and teachers.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; May the Lord God bless his precious
[1:02:38] words to our heart. You may be seated.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I think this evening all of us
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; would want to give honor and
[1:02:49] appreciation to this church for these
[1:02:52] wonderful services.
[1:02:54] [Applause]
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:02] Dear pastor, his wife, your officers,
[1:03:05] brother Isaac, all your efforts,
[1:03:09] all of us
[1:03:11] without a doubt
[1:03:14] leaving with a testimony
[1:03:16] that we enjoy these services.
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:26] Knowing a little about services, I could
[1:03:30] imagine the kind they have here. They
[1:03:33] are real tired.
[1:03:36] They are real worn out and they need two
[1:03:39] Mondays after the Sunday,
[1:03:43] you know. So, we appreciate them. But
[1:03:46] you know what will make their labor and
[1:03:49] give a joy
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; to them?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; All the expenses and all it takes to put
[1:03:56] up this what will give a joy not only to
[1:04:00] them but to almighty God
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; that these services draw us closer to
[1:04:07] him.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That someone
[1:04:12] was delivered.
[1:04:14] someone because the truth be told
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; we ought not to come here and don't
[1:04:20] leave better.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Should should I be vernacular? You
[1:04:26] should leave better better.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; All these services you get, all these
[1:04:32] blessings you receive, you know what it
[1:04:35] should have done for us by the grace of
[1:04:38] God.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe most of us because
[1:04:42] technology will have it. I was here for
[1:04:45] this is my third time being here but
[1:04:47] technology will have it that we had an
[1:04:49] opportunity to take part in all the
[1:04:52] services
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; you know so we were able to you know
[1:04:57] receive the blessings of being here.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I should share, you wonder
[1:05:03] why I read that scripture, but if I
[1:05:06] should share a little thought with you,
[1:05:09] the reason why you get all these
[1:05:11] blessings is Ephesians 4:11.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. Thank you.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; is the reason why
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; you had we get it from God,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; but he used
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; we got it from God. But God had to use a
[1:05:33] vessel.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And he,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; not common age,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; but really H, capital H.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; He, almighty God,
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; he give.
[1:05:47] So Ephesians 4:11
[1:05:50] identify to us predestinated offices.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11 identify to us
[1:06:01] predestinated gifts.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; It identify to us God called gifts.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; God forain gifts.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Elected offices of God,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; divine gifts that God give us.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; And that if God didn't give you, if God
[1:06:22] didn't give us it, we cannot get the
[1:06:24] trouble.
[1:06:25] I hope you don't mind
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; if you didn't get it. If God ain't give
[1:06:28] away it, we cannot get the real
[1:06:30] blessing.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; But we believe God give us
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; and we thank God for the gift.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; In the message blind battas, God's
[1:06:40] prophet tells us and God set in the
[1:06:44] church.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; First what? Missionaries, apostles. And
[1:06:48] missionary as I told you taught the same
[1:06:51] thing. Apostles, prophet, evangelists,
[1:06:54] pastors, God set in the church.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; God set them for the perfecting of the
[1:07:00] church.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; So the church cannot be perfected.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; The church cannot be perfected
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; outside these gifts.
[1:07:11] That's divine gifts of God
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; for ordained and set into the church
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the church.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us that Jesus speaks
[1:07:29] through the pastor.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks through his teacher.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; He speaks through his seer, his prophet.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; He speaks through his missionary. Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's his gift
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and he put it in the church.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; So, we want to thank God we could
[1:07:47] identify over the the the few days of
[1:07:50] services, this being the seventh
[1:07:53] service, we want to thank God that we
[1:07:55] could identify with a ministry of
[1:07:58] perfection.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; A ministry that God had set.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; There's no evidence that God take them
[1:08:07] out.
[1:08:09] Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; No, there's no evidence that God take
[1:08:12] them out.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; God put them there.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; This is a work of Almighty God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Is Almighty God that set them there
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and Almighty God set us for a purpose.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; The perfecting of the body.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That has nothing to do with a man.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; No man put you there.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:08:38] No man put you there.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; You might say I vote for him.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Don't fool yourself with that vote.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; God first put them there.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; That is why you could recognize them.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; It is who God put there.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We as pastors, we could put
[1:08:57] deacons and trustees.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; That's all we could do.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Bring in deacons and trustees. But God
[1:09:06] puts the fivefold.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Not to take much of your time. In Acts
[1:09:14] chapter 1:21, you remember when Judas
[1:09:17] passed away,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Judas give up. Amen. The disciples,
[1:09:22] those real top of the line men,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; those top the best of the best,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; they had the keys.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they had the first time they
[1:09:32] going to use the key. Yes.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And they end up with Matias
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; that you never heard of after that.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; But God had
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; God had
[1:09:47] one known as all
[1:09:50] who was Paul.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:56] Hallelujah.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; God had a highteer Jew.
[1:10:01] You may not like
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You may not like
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; the five-fold,
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; but you don't have to like them.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It is God that choose them.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; It is God that choose them.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And if God choose them, you better
[1:10:20] respect them.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; If you respect them, God will bless you.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:32] And other than respect them,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; don't have favorites.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; If God send you, we are all the same.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; One brother will be more blessed in a
[1:10:45] different way. Another boy blessed in a
[1:10:48] different way. But they all come from
[1:10:50] God.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; So have no favorites.
[1:10:54] Don't set your eye on any man.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Are we all right?
[1:11:00] Are we all right?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So we thank God tonight that we could
[1:11:04] have recognized over the past days.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Men that God put.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; And if God put them, they are qualified.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God put them, if God put
[1:11:17] them, they're going to be a hindrance.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I said if God didn't put you, you're
[1:11:22] going to be a hindrance.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; If God put you, you're going to be an
[1:11:26] obstacle. If God put you, you going to
[1:11:29] interfere. You're going to make these
[1:11:30] brothers life hard.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Thus said the prophet.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; If God put you, you'll be an obstacle to
[1:11:39] a real preacher's way.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But we thank God for God men.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; God give them the gifts.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Predestinated offices.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody a lay hand on them.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Nobody. You can't pray for that gift.
[1:11:57] You can't feel for the gift.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; You can't desire for the gift.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; No, it's God placed them there.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; We talking about something that is
[1:12:10] supernatural.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Something that you cannot pray for.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; You cannot wish for.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; You cannot desire it.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; It comes from almighty God.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You could do nothing about
[1:12:26] it.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You cannot walk yourself into it.
[1:12:29] Hallelujah. It's like saying some of
[1:12:31] these brothers here, they are born
[1:12:33] musician.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; If they're not born musician, school
[1:12:36] ain't going to help them.
[1:12:39] School will only help them if they have
[1:12:42] something in them.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I could tell you that, right?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You cannot push something
[1:12:52] in somebody
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; if that thing is not there.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; So we praise God. When you're thanking
[1:13:03] God for these services and you
[1:13:05] appreciate this, you're going to
[1:13:06] recognize it is a blessing from Almighty
[1:13:09] God.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The sovereign God has blessed you.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; The sovereign God has blessed you with
[1:13:18] these gifts. the sovereign God who could
[1:13:21] do what he want. You can't tell God who
[1:13:23] to choose.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; You cannot choose for God you're out of
[1:13:26] place.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; You have to accept to be blessed. You
[1:13:30] have to accept what God has given.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I I believe we all could recall. Amen.
[1:13:41] God's prophet came from a family.
[1:13:43] Catholics on both side
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; as a sinner man.
[1:13:48] The gift was in him.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; As a sinner man, he seeing visions.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us, he say, "I see
[1:13:56] visions just like how you drink water."
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; As a sinner,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; the gift is from the sovereign God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Gifts and calling the scripture tells us
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; are without repentance.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Repentance does not bring gifts.
[1:14:16] gifts are predestinated.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] Last night we really enjoyed Amen.
[1:14:23] Brother Isaac. Amen. And I seek
[1:14:26] permission to take hold of those
[1:14:28] thoughts and share it with our young
[1:14:30] people. So we thank God for the gift.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; A amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now God's prophet tells us
[1:14:38] the gift the gift cannot leave you.
[1:14:44] Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; You remember the same night
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Samson slept with a harot.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's the same next morning he pick up
[1:14:56] the gate.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; So God would not take away the gift.
[1:15:08] But
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; if I use it wrong,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; if you use it wrong, God will deal with
[1:15:14] me.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; God will deal with you
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; for using it wrong.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we want to thank God that
[1:15:23] we could identify with predestinated
[1:15:27] offices,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; predestinated gifts of God to bring the
[1:15:32] church together.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; They are they have a purpose. They have
[1:15:37] a job description. Their job description
[1:15:40] is to bring the people together for the
[1:15:43] glory of God.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That is their purpose. Go and go veet
[1:15:48] for them for doing the work.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; You better pray for them and thank God
[1:15:53] for them. Their job is to put you in
[1:15:56] order.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Their job is to put me in order. Their
[1:16:00] job is to lift you up for the they
[1:16:03] working for the self.
[1:16:06] I said they are not working for
[1:16:07] themselves.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; What they are doing is for the glory of
[1:16:10] God.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we know anything you
[1:16:17] doing for the glory of God will fall
[1:16:18] down.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; But we thank God you do for the glory of
[1:16:23] God is going to last.
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So let me take two or three minutes and
[1:16:32] just close off. I just want to show
[1:16:34] taking from the message putting on the
[1:16:36] whole armor of God. Paragraph 76.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; God fortified his army
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; with what?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Himself
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; in the form of prophets,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; apostles,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; teachers and pastors.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; God fortified his army with himself.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Himself is in the form of your pastor.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. What did he do? What was God
[1:17:07] doing? Listen. Did you ever think of
[1:17:10] that? Teachers, pastors, what did he do?
[1:17:13] What was God doing? Listen. Amen. The
[1:17:18] officers of the church. It's God's
[1:17:19] dress. Where?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a
[1:17:23] seer. Amen. Foresee before Satan ever
[1:17:26] get it done. What is it? Is God dressed
[1:17:29] up in his church?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Who these officers are? God dressed up
[1:17:34] in his church
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; is God's dress wear.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you see these
[1:17:40] offices, pastors, teachers, what is
[1:17:43] that? That's God's dressear.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I love this
[1:17:47] piece.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; God's prophet put a disclaimer.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; We always hear about buy something have
[1:17:53] a disclaimer.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I hear the disclaimer now.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] What is that? That is God's dress wear
[1:18:04] is God's presence working through man.
[1:18:07] And if that office
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; deny any of this word,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; it is not God's dressing.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; So God tell you, the word tell you how
[1:18:19] to recognize what is God's dress.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the disclaimer. If we
[1:18:25] do anything or we preach or believe in
[1:18:27] anything contrary to the word, it is not
[1:18:30] God's dressing.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; No, that's a wolf in sheep clothing.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Watch that fella.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; So in the same way tonight to temper
[1:18:40] off. In the same way tonight, Amen. God
[1:18:45] have a fivefold, the devil also have
[1:18:48] one.
[1:18:53] Now I got to tell you the truth.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; No, we must not give half truth.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; We we we are called to give the full
[1:19:01] counsel of God.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; The devil have a five-fold
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and the apostle Paul identified it in 2
[1:19:08] Corinthians 11:13. For such are false
[1:19:12] apostles,
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; deceitful workers,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; transforming themselves into apostles of
[1:19:19] Christ,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; and no marvel for Satan himself is
[1:19:23] transformed into an angel of light.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it is no great thing if his
[1:19:28] ministers also be transformed as
[1:19:31] ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:19:34] shall be according to their work.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; So the devil have a five-fold Yes sir.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The devil have make believe preachers,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; make believe prophets
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; and we know it in 2 Chronicles about the
[1:19:50] lion spirit.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, there's a lying spirit. That's how
[1:19:55] to deceive. How to deceive Ahab. Get
[1:19:58] into them lying spirit.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lying spirit into preachers.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So if it is not the
[1:20:08] word, don't believe it.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's the disclaimer.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Turn on the light. And a man who can
[1:20:17] turn on the light, you can go and read
[1:20:18] it. God's prophet express it very
[1:20:21] simply.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He said no Lutheran
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; could deceive a Methodist.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. a Lutheran Methodist came out from
[1:20:34] them,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; right? No method, no no Methodist, Amen,
[1:20:40] could deceive a Lutheran, right? No, a
[1:20:44] Pentecostal
[1:20:47] cannot a Methodist cannot deceive a
[1:20:49] Pentecostal
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; because you didn't get it.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And the bride dig out Pentecostal eye.
[1:20:56] The point I'm making tonight,
[1:20:58] the five-fold of the enemy is in the
[1:21:01] midst of those who believe what we
[1:21:03] believe.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; If you could stomach it,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; It is in our realms.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; There is where it coming from somewhere
[1:21:21] else. it coming right from our realms.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And just let me said one more thing
[1:21:28] before I sit
[1:21:30] and you lay members don't think we only
[1:21:32] talking about the preacher.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; God don't forget you.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; God's prophet tells us that God set the
[1:21:41] lay member.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; God you have a you have a purpose.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You have a ministry.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; In present stage of my ministry, he
[1:21:50] said, "Amen. God will crown your
[1:21:52] ministry.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe a housewife.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Are we in church?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Are we in church?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Are we in church?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe. Amen. A layman.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe a farmer.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; God will crown your life for his glory.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we cannot have a church without
[1:22:14] you.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; My prophet tells us without you there's
[1:22:18] no me. Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for the lady.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] But if God
[1:22:27] wanted to be a lay member, I'll be a
[1:22:30] better lay member than a preacher.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; If God
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; wanted me to be a lay member, I would be
[1:22:41] better off a lay member than would be a
[1:22:44] preacher.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if God ain't call us, we
[1:22:51] will never make it.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Outside the call of God,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; we'll do nothing but mess it up.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:03] But stay in line with God's word,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; whether we be minister or lay people,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; because a little housewife is much in
[1:23:11] the kingdom of God
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; as an apostle.
[1:23:15] God positionally placed you here in his
[1:23:18] body to be a housewife,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; to be a farmer.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be a preacher.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; In God's secret economy, he placed you
[1:23:28] in his body. God bless you as we
[1:23:30] continue to enjoy the word. Great things
[1:23:34] he has done amongst us. God bless you.
[1:23:42] We appreciate brother Green.
[1:23:45] Wonderful
[1:23:47] brother, sister. We can do better than
[1:23:48] that. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] Amen. Let us just sing. God is moving
[1:23:58] all over the world. Amen.
[1:24:02] [Music]

[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Uh greetings church in the wonderful
[1:39:39] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I asked our brother to sing that song. I
[1:39:45] got a message on power
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; and he said the powers move like a
[1:39:51] magnet. I said that's it. Go for it.
[1:39:53] Let's go for it. You believe the power
[1:39:55] is moving like a magnet.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; So, so the magnet is drawing power.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; So, if he draws on you and someone next
[1:40:02] to you is not moving, just move a bit
[1:40:05] closer
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; and magnetize that person. And once we
[1:40:09] magnetize each other, oh my goodness,
[1:40:12] the fire of God is going to fall. Demons
[1:40:15] are going to run out of here because we
[1:40:17] all magnetize. Amen. God bless you.
[1:40:20] Thank you, brother Theo, once again in
[1:40:22] the Headstone Tabernacle. What a
[1:40:24] convention. Can we give the Lord a hand
[1:40:26] of praise? What a blessing.
[1:40:29] What an honor to be here. I was sitting
[1:40:31] there and I thought, uh, Brother Theo,
[1:40:34] brother Isaac Hone, I thought, man, God
[1:40:36] made history this weekend.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And you know, brother men speaks of
[1:40:41] what's the traction on the mountain
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; and I was saying, what's the attraction
[1:40:44] here
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; in Headstone Tabernacle? Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; What was God doing? Making history.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; And you will go back never the same
[1:40:55] again.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; All of us. Our brother Green says you
[1:40:58] come to church, you'll never go back the
[1:41:00] same. Brother says you go out worse or
[1:41:02] you go out better.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; So thank you, brother Theo. A
[1:41:05] tabernacle,
[1:41:06] uh, brother Thompson, the food was so
[1:41:08] good, the music was good, the singing
[1:41:10] was good, the preaching was good, uh,
[1:41:14] the atmosphere is good, everything is
[1:41:16] good. So, we want to say thank you.
[1:41:18] Thank you for all the specials. And what
[1:41:21] can we say about Brother Isaac's
[1:41:22] message? My God salute you. What a
[1:41:25] masterpiece. What a blessing. Uh so that
[1:41:29] was really beautiful. Brother Isaac uh
[1:41:32] keep going. God has anointed you. And
[1:41:35] like brother Green says, you know,
[1:41:37] brother says, you're born with that
[1:41:39] gift.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; No man can make you a pastor or a
[1:41:42] preacher. He says he told Jeremiah
[1:41:44] before you even formed in your mother's
[1:41:46] womb, I ordained you a prophet. You
[1:41:48] know, so God ordained you with that
[1:41:50] gift, brother Theo too. Thank you. So
[1:41:53] everyone uh that has been part of this,
[1:41:55] I want to say thank you, brother Olo.
[1:41:57] What a message this morning. Wow. We
[1:42:00] salute you. Was brought so beautiful.
[1:42:03] Uh that's a very deep thought, but he
[1:42:06] made it so simple. We all could
[1:42:08] understand it. Even the young ones could
[1:42:10] understand. And we salute you, brother.
[1:42:13] And God richly bless you. And uh
[1:42:18] he always tease. He says when he grows
[1:42:20] up, he want to be like me.
[1:42:24] And I'm trying to catch him up.
[1:42:29] So thank you. And brother Theo, this was
[1:42:31] really outstanding convention.
[1:42:34] Outstanding. I was blessed. And uh as
[1:42:38] our brother Green says, without the
[1:42:40] people there's no convention. So let's
[1:42:43] give yourself a hand for coming to this
[1:42:45] meeting.
[1:42:50] Amen.
[1:42:53] So if I forgot anyone, the musicians,
[1:42:55] the chorus lead, everyone thank you and
[1:42:58] thank you for the invite. It was so
[1:42:59] great to come all these miles. Now when
[1:43:01] you say you're going to Trinidad, you
[1:43:03] must have pluck.
[1:43:06] I don't know if you understand that
[1:43:07] word. You must have cuts because it's so
[1:43:10] far you travel for hours. But I tell
[1:43:12] you, every moment was worth it to be
[1:43:16] here in the presence of almighty God.
[1:43:23] So, thank you. God bless you. I'm not
[1:43:25] going to be long tonight. It's a prayer
[1:43:27] line. So, if we just uh bow our heads
[1:43:29] for a short word of uh and brother Theo,
[1:43:33] I like to salute your wife always. You
[1:43:35] know, we always forget the wife. Sister
[1:43:36] Emory, she here or she here. But thanks,
[1:43:39] Sister Emory and uh for the Isaac Wives
[1:43:42] of Tama. We really want to bless you and
[1:43:45] it's it's it's behind the scenes. You
[1:43:47] always find they do the most of the work
[1:43:48] and the planning. So, thank you,
[1:43:51] heavenly father. We thank you again
[1:43:53] gather this night as we come away from
[1:43:55] the hustle and bustle, the cares of this
[1:43:56] life. We see the world falling apart,
[1:43:59] Lord. We see the handwriting on the
[1:44:01] wall. We see the signs of you're coming
[1:44:03] all around us. But Lord, the Bible told
[1:44:06] us when these things happen, lift up
[1:44:08] your head. Look up for your redemption
[1:44:10] is drawing high. We're so thankful our
[1:44:12] souls is saved, Lord. But we're waiting
[1:44:14] for the redemption of our bodies,
[1:44:16] Father. And Lord, that's soon to happen
[1:44:19] and soon to appear, Lord. So give us
[1:44:21] grace. This is the last service. We
[1:44:23] welcome your presence. And someone
[1:44:25] didn't receive their blessing. May they
[1:44:27] receive it tonight. Lord, give us
[1:44:29] anction to speak. And I always say,
[1:44:31] Lord, this message is anointed. So is
[1:44:33] your word anointed. We need that
[1:44:35] anointing to come upon us. Bless the
[1:44:38] preaching of the word. Heal the sick
[1:44:39] tonight. That's what we've come for with
[1:44:41] faith in our hearts that no demon will
[1:44:44] stand before the presence of God. And
[1:44:46] every demon, Lord, power will be bound
[1:44:48] tonight. So may the people that just
[1:44:51] rise up with faith tonight, Lord, to
[1:44:54] take a hold of your promise. And we come
[1:44:56] to the end of the service. We won't
[1:44:58] forget to give you the honor, the
[1:45:01] praise, and the glory.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; For we ask it in Jesus name.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Church, I'll say
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; the church shall say
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; amen. So, it's the last night.
[1:45:16] Uh I always say this, but Jesus on the
[1:45:20] last day of the feast.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Uh and if you didn't receive your
[1:45:24] portion yet, it's not over. Amen.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And on the last day, he said,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; if any man thirst,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; let him come unto me
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; and drink of the waters of life. So I'm
[1:45:36] saying tonight, if you're still thirsty,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; there's still one more opportunity for
[1:45:40] you
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; to break through tonight and say, Lord,
[1:45:43] I want that power of God in my life.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; So if you have your Bibles, very short
[1:45:48] scriptures, Acts 1:8, Romans 8:18,
[1:45:53] and Philippians 1:2. Excuse
[1:46:03] me.
[1:46:15] Now it's very familiar scripture. Acts
[1:46:17] 18.
[1:46:26] But he shall receive power after that
[1:46:28] the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and
[1:46:30] you shall be witnesses unto me, both in
[1:46:33] Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria, and
[1:46:37] unto the uttermost parts of the earth.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Even Trinidad.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Romans 8
[1:46:47] and we'll read verse 18.
[1:46:51] For I reckon that the suffering of this
[1:46:53] present time are not worthy to be
[1:46:56] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:46:59] revealed in us.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; So the glory is being revealed in us.
[1:47:05] Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; And then Philippians 1
[1:47:10] and verse 20.
[1:47:17] According to my expect earnest
[1:47:19] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[1:47:22] I shall be ashamed, but that with all
[1:47:25] boldness,
[1:47:26] as always, so now also Christ shall be
[1:47:30] magnified in my body,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; whether it be life or by death. May the
[1:47:35] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:47:36] his word. You may be seated.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; So we're not tired. Eh,
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; if we are tired, we tired of the devil.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're tired of him.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And every demon has to go tonight. Yes.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we came with a
[1:48:05] attitude of victory tonight.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that's how I
[1:48:09] came.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Uh I always like uh I took it from
[1:48:13] Rubbranom. He says when you go into a
[1:48:15] city, he says and he climbs out of the
[1:48:17] plane. He says when he puts his foot on
[1:48:19] that ground,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; he claims that country
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and he binds every demon in that city.
[1:48:25] So when I put my foot on the ground, I
[1:48:27] bound the head demon of Trinidad.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; So if the the the head demon is bound,
[1:48:34] brother Goki, then all the imps,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; they have to go and God's people is
[1:48:42] gathered. And when God's people is
[1:48:44] gathered, the demons has got to go.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And brother says, if God must open our
[1:48:49] eyes, we'll be surprised to see the
[1:48:51] angels of God walking up and down here.
[1:48:54] So tonight, as our brother Olu preached,
[1:48:56] you're not alone, brother. The angels
[1:48:58] come with a tent. Brother Graham says,
[1:49:00] and they camp around you. So tonight,
[1:49:03] you're not just here in the church, but
[1:49:05] the angels of God are walking up and
[1:49:07] down.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So my title tonight, God's
[1:49:11] power is your power.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now. God's power is your power.
[1:49:18] My subject, God will shake the world
[1:49:21] with a pride
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; and my inspiration. He shall receive
[1:49:24] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:49:26] you.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. He says you have proof of his
[1:49:30] resurrection. What is it? The last days
[1:49:32] God is going to raise up men
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; with messages with power and
[1:49:37] deliverance.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; When in the last days, God is going to
[1:49:41] raise up men. And I hear our brother
[1:49:43] Green spoke of the five-fold ministry.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; They're not just put there. You can't
[1:49:48] vote them in. They are born. Bible says
[1:49:50] when they drop from the womb, they drop
[1:49:52] with that gift.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; And yet he says, "What is God going to
[1:49:55] do in the last days?" God is going to
[1:49:57] raise up men with messages, with power
[1:50:00] and deliverance, with power of the
[1:50:03] gospel to prove that Jesus Christ is the
[1:50:06] same yesterday, today, and forever. Did
[1:50:08] you feel it this weekend that may God
[1:50:10] raise up men with messages of power to
[1:50:13] deliver the bride of Jesus Christ? He
[1:50:17] says you're in the second end robe.
[1:50:20] He says, "And God has never left himself
[1:50:23] on the earth without a witness."
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; God has always had somebody
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; someplace had a person that he could put
[1:50:30] his hands on
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; and he would stand for a witness.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; So is he if he did that down since
[1:50:38] Genesis the beginning, surely somewhere
[1:50:41] God has got a man that he can lay his
[1:50:43] hands on. Now, now someone reads it and
[1:50:46] stops there and say, "Amen."
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; But go just the very next verse. He says
[1:50:53] he's he's he's more than one man now.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; So, no man has claims that he has the
[1:51:02] authority on this message alone because
[1:51:06] God has got men now.
[1:51:08] men now he has many men that can lay his
[1:51:13] hands on because we coming down to the
[1:51:16] gathering time which is harvest time. So
[1:51:19] in the time of the harvest no man can
[1:51:21] claim this is my message. I'm the
[1:51:23] authority I can do. No my brother God
[1:51:26] has got men all over the world that he
[1:51:29] can lay his hands on. And you know what
[1:51:32] says he's going to say there's my spirit
[1:51:34] flowing freely. I found one here and I
[1:51:37] found one there and I found another one
[1:51:39] there. So, it's not one man show.
[1:51:43] In fact, man's time is over. This is a
[1:51:46] man that's got to be praised. We raising
[1:51:48] up Jesus. We coming together under the
[1:51:51] banner of Jesus. No church, no
[1:51:53] denomination, no no religion, brother,
[1:51:56] but we coming under the banner of Jesus.
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:06] Hallelujah.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; He says you're recognizing your day.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something. National
[1:52:13] force put Israel in the homeland.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; National force will put the church in
[1:52:18] the world council of churches.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; But the power of God will put the people
[1:52:23] in the pride. So that's why I said I'm
[1:52:26] not interested in Rome, brother Goki,
[1:52:28] and what's happening out there, but I'm
[1:52:30] interested in the power of God that's
[1:52:33] got going to get us out of here.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And I hope you're also interested
[1:52:38] because if you're not interested in the
[1:52:40] power of God, you're going to miss it.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And you're going to wonder, why didn't I
[1:52:43] make it? And you're going to say, wasn't
[1:52:45] there supposed to be a rapture? And the
[1:52:47] rapture will be passed and the the wise
[1:52:50] virgin went in and here you still
[1:52:52] sitting.
[1:52:53] Brother, it's time to wake up. It's time
[1:52:56] to get desperate. It's time to seek the
[1:52:58] face of God. It's time to pray in your
[1:53:01] house. Call the altar. Get the children
[1:53:04] together. God wants to deal in your
[1:53:06] house. He wants to be the head of your
[1:53:08] home, the head of your family, the head
[1:53:11] of the church. He wants to have
[1:53:13] rulership.
[1:53:17] Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] Oh, brother. I feel the fire of God. He
[1:53:21] says here the power of God will put the
[1:53:24] people in the bride. The world forces
[1:53:26] this way and the world forces that way
[1:53:29] but God forces upward. Oh, I want to
[1:53:32] tell you there's an upward pull. The
[1:53:34] spirit of God which is the word of God.
[1:53:36] My word my word is spirit and life. So
[1:53:39] you can't say word word only and you
[1:53:42] can't say spirit spirit only. You get
[1:53:45] you got to gather two together. And when
[1:53:47] you get them together then there's fire
[1:53:49] brother Paul. Then the anointing falls
[1:53:52] and the power of God. And tonight I'm
[1:53:54] looking for the sick to be healed. And I
[1:53:56] want to tell you cancer is just a name.
[1:53:59] Brother B says it's a demon.
[1:54:02] High blood pressure is a demon. Sugar
[1:54:06] diabetes is a demon. And tonight we
[1:54:09] calling that demon on his name. Satan,
[1:54:11] you're a liar. God's people is going to
[1:54:14] be healed.
[1:54:16] Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] Amen. And I feel the power of God. I
[1:54:21] know the anointing here. And the
[1:54:23] anointing will break the yoke.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Wow. My word is spirit and life will put
[1:54:30] the bride in a place cuz you recognize
[1:54:32] the position in the word. Then she's in
[1:54:34] Christ. Will put her in the place. No
[1:54:37] national force will do that. So many
[1:54:39] people say, "I'm waiting for the
[1:54:40] squeeze."
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; No, it's not the squeeze going to put
[1:54:43] you in the bride. It's the power of God
[1:54:45] is going to put you in the bride.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. He says uh drive
[1:54:53] Israel to the homeland. National force
[1:54:55] and the council of churches will drive
[1:54:57] every organization by the power of God
[1:55:01] will raise the bride into glory. Aren't
[1:55:04] you helping in the bride? Come on
[1:55:06] church, you must preach back to me.
[1:55:09] You're not tired. I'm tired. But I know
[1:55:12] the Holy Ghost is here to quicken you.
[1:55:14] You know when Elijah was tired and he
[1:55:17] heard the noise, he heard the just the
[1:55:19] sound. He says goes, "Look up seven
[1:55:21] times and he seen the hand of a cloud
[1:55:24] like a man's hand." Did he sit back and
[1:55:26] say, "Wow, that's nice.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; That old man over there, he got up,
[1:55:30] brother." He says, "Go right to Jezel
[1:55:33] and sound the rain bells. I hear a sound
[1:55:36] of abundance of rain." Brother, I don't
[1:55:39] care how old you are. I don't care how
[1:55:41] sick you are. But tonight, I hear the
[1:55:43] sound of abundance of rain. There's a
[1:55:47] cloud and there's going to be a cloud
[1:55:49] burst and you're going to be healed.
[1:55:52] You're going to be delivered. You're
[1:55:54] going to be set free. Come on, young
[1:55:56] people. Preach back to me. Give me
[1:55:59] something, man. I need a strength. I
[1:56:02] need virtue. Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. He
[1:56:11] says here
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; contest but I want to speak for this
[1:56:16] ministers quickly upon the greatest
[1:56:18] contest
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; there is. Now I want you to notice where
[1:56:21] he places
[1:56:23] and I said God's power is your power.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; So tonight I'm preaching to you as the
[1:56:28] bride
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and we got to find out where is God's
[1:56:32] power.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; How can I get this power?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; How do I get into this power? Yeah.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; And he says here, I want to speak on the
[1:56:40] greatest contest there is between the
[1:56:44] church and Satan. He didn't say God,
[1:56:46] brother Isaac.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Between who?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; The church.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; So you mean this battle that we have now
[1:56:53] is not between God and Satan.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Because God gave his power to the
[1:56:57] church.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; All that was in God, he bought into
[1:57:00] Christ.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he bought into
[1:57:04] into the church. So where's the power
[1:57:06] now? in the church. So his power is your
[1:57:10] power. Now why do you sit back when the
[1:57:13] power of God is here to anoint you to
[1:57:16] break through tonight? Break through
[1:57:18] every chain. Break through every demon
[1:57:20] power. Break through the sickness. Break
[1:57:23] through everything that has you bound.
[1:57:26] You can break through because the power,
[1:57:28] his power is your power. Woo.
[1:57:31] Hallelujah. Brother, listen man. You
[1:57:34] came in here not with your power. You
[1:57:36] came in here with his power.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; You are saved by his power. You are
[1:57:41] delivered by his power. You are healed
[1:57:43] by his power. Everything that you have
[1:57:46] is his power. Hallelujah.
[1:57:49] My my my
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; between the church and Satan.
[1:57:59] The great strength of Satan we want to
[1:58:01] speak of. But the great strength of God
[1:58:04] in his church.
[1:58:07] Wow.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; So, brother,
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; I came here so anointed you won't
[1:58:12] believe.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; I'm tired and well, but I said, man, I
[1:58:16] was studying. I'm praying. I was walking
[1:58:18] up and down.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; And I said, man, the devil is a liar.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You see, we got to call his bluff.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; As long as he got you cornered
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; and you in in back there and you pull
[1:58:31] him back and oh, I don't know what I'm
[1:58:33] going to do. then he's got you whipped,
[1:58:34] man. But when you stand up and say
[1:58:37] enough is enough, Satan, you're a bluff.
[1:58:41] I'm going to be healed tonight. I'm
[1:58:43] going to be delivered.
[1:58:45] Nothing will keep me bound anymore. And
[1:58:48] I'm going free. Drugs, I'm going free.
[1:58:51] Pornography, I'm going free. Lust, I'm
[1:58:53] going free. It doesn't matter what it
[1:58:55] is. You are free tonight, brother. Why?
[1:58:59] The power that was his is yours.
[1:59:04] Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:59:06] Come on now, man. Hallelujah. The great
[1:59:10] strength of Satan versus the strength of
[1:59:14] God in his church.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus says, "Not if I speak
[1:59:18] to the mountain."
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; If you speak, so where's the power to
[1:59:25] speak?
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; So tonight, speak for your children.
[1:59:30] Speak for your family. Speak for those
[1:59:32] that are not here. Say, "Lord, they're
[1:59:34] not here. I don't know where they are,
[1:59:36] but I'm speaking for them, God. Turn
[1:59:39] them around. Bring conviction upon them.
[1:59:42] Speak the word and go forward.
[1:59:45] Speak the word and don't worry what's
[1:59:46] going to happen. God will bring them in.
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, please listen to me. This is the
[2:00:01] last message.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Putting on the whole armor.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Said I I'll be with my army.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Not only that, but I'm going in my army.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother Paul. This is powerful,
[2:00:16] man.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; He says not only uh he says I I'll be
[2:00:20] with my army. Not only that, but I'm
[2:00:22] going in my army.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think of it. Our great warrior,
[2:00:26] great triumph word general in us. The
[2:00:30] word who was made flesh and triumph over
[2:00:32] every demon. Watch every sickness,
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; every death, hell in the grave. That
[2:00:39] same general is in us.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother. Come on, man. You've got
[2:00:43] to preach back. You can't sit like that.
[2:00:45] The same general that overcame
[2:00:47] everything. He overcame death. He
[2:00:50] overcame every demon. The same general
[2:00:53] is in us tonight. That's why we have the
[2:00:56] right to command Satan. Be careful.
[2:00:59] Satan, get out of my way. Satan, you're
[2:01:02] a liar. The general in me speaks to you.
[2:01:06] Come on, man. The general is in you
[2:01:08] tonight. Speak the word. Speak the word.
[2:01:11] Hallelujah. The same general is in you
[2:01:14] tonight. Woo! I feel so happy, man. The
[2:01:18] He doesn't go with you, but he's in you
[2:01:21] tonight. Hallelujah. What a glorious
[2:01:24] time. Brother Charles, the great general
[2:01:27] is in you. healed you. Hallelujah.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Brother three. In us,
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; not with us. Brother Green, not with us.
[2:01:38] He's in us.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; The great general that already overcame.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, because I overcome, you
[2:01:44] will overcome.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Raymond, I can't get
[2:01:46] rid of this." Get the general in there
[2:01:49] and watch how you overcome, brother.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:53] [Applause]
[2:02:00] triumph over every sickness, even death,
[2:02:02] hell, and the grave. That same general
[2:02:04] is in us
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; with us. How long? How long is he going
[2:02:08] to be with us?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Just from revival till the next
[2:02:12] convention,
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; till the next
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; till we get back into our homes.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; He says, watch here. Till the end of the
[2:02:20] world.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, friend. Hallelujah. He's going
[2:02:23] to be with us until the end of the
[2:02:25] world. He said, "I'll never leave you.
[2:02:28] I'll never forsake you, but I'll be with
[2:02:30] you even in you to the end of the
[2:02:32] world." Right on down. Think of it. The
[2:02:34] one that's leading the battle, every
[2:02:36] power of the enemy is defeated.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; When he was here on earth, he took the
[2:02:41] word and triumphed over everything.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Satan had. He triumphed over death. He
[2:02:46] triumphed over hell. He triumphed over
[2:02:49] the grain. He rose up on the third day
[2:02:51] and he's come back now living in the
[2:02:54] church.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; So he doesn't live in a church building.
[2:02:59] Who's the church?
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Who's the church?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; You're the church. So the general is
[2:03:07] living in you.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:10] We leave from this church. But you know
[2:03:12] tomorrow will be church.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Tuesday will be church. Who's the
[2:03:20] church? God goes to church every day. He
[2:03:23] wakes you up. He's going to church.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. The same word that the word is in
[2:03:34] us living himself punctuating every sign
[2:03:36] of the resurrection. He's coming. Amen.
[2:03:39] He's doing it today in every time when
[2:03:42] the great evening lights are begin to
[2:03:43] shine. Hallelujah. Great warrior. Christ
[2:03:47] already triumph.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't a thing for me to do. Now what you
[2:03:50] worried?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't a thing for me to do. Just follow.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; After these meetings when you go back to
[2:03:58] your city, don't worry to do anything.
[2:04:01] Just follow what was being said.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; The enemy is going to come and say,
[2:04:05] "What happened here? It turned that was
[2:04:07] nothing. He's a liar. You going back
[2:04:10] with your head back, your shoulders
[2:04:12] raised. You charge with the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:15] You heard from your theophony. Your
[2:04:17] glorified condition is going with you.
[2:04:19] And you're going to be charged up. No
[2:04:21] more trouble to the pastor. You're going
[2:04:23] to hold his hands up. You're going to
[2:04:25] support. You're going to be an asset,
[2:04:27] not a deficit.
[2:04:33] We don't want deficit Christians in the
[2:04:35] church. We want people that is a asset.
[2:04:39] Prayer warriors, mothers that pray,
[2:04:43] fathers that pray. Hallelujah. That come
[2:04:46] to church not expecting something, but
[2:04:49] they make something happen. They under
[2:04:51] the anointing of God. They the answer to
[2:04:54] the church.
[2:04:56] Hallelujah. Are you an asset or are you
[2:04:59] a deficit?
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; I can't hear you in the back there. Are
[2:05:06] you a asset or are you a deficit?
[2:05:12] Oh, glory.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Brother, I got a first quote I left
[2:05:22] here. I left it out,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; but I just want to quote it. He says,
[2:05:26] "No man has a right to make any claims
[2:05:28] on God."
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe I can go to it.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; I know the ministers will like this.
[2:05:37] We sit too much with people that trying
[2:05:40] to bind the church. Brother Green, you
[2:05:42] know what?
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; They can't put their hands on this lady.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; This lady is God's wife.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; You think he's going to leave it over to
[2:05:52] man to man handle it?
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; You're in trouble. Whoever man's handles
[2:05:57] this pride is in trouble, brother.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; This lady belongs to him. He says here
[2:06:04] dedication the trouble of today we try
[2:06:07] to yoke up with everything
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; the churches the trying to yoke up with
[2:06:11] the world but the power of God is not
[2:06:14] yolked up to nobody but God.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody but God. God's power is not
[2:06:22] yolked up to your group. My group has
[2:06:25] it. My church has it. Listen man, if you
[2:06:28] got it, you don't have to say anything.
[2:06:30] If if it's there, it speaks for itself.
[2:06:34] And your church don't have it. You don't
[2:06:36] have it. God has the power. Amen,
[2:06:39] brother Charles. Amen. Away with this
[2:06:42] foolishness. We tired of it. We need God
[2:06:45] to come on the scene. We need a uniting.
[2:06:49] We need a forgiving. We need to love. We
[2:06:51] need to drop the odds. Stop waiting for
[2:06:54] the next person to come and fix up. You
[2:06:56] You go and say, "Lord, I'm to the
[2:06:58] person, I'm sorry, man.
[2:07:02] We come in the church with OS and we go
[2:07:04] out with OS. Last year you had the same
[2:07:07] OS. It's another convention. You're
[2:07:09] still sitting with the same one. Come
[2:07:11] on, brother. It's time to drop your odds
[2:07:14] that God can move in the church. Signs,
[2:07:17] wonders, and miracles when we are a
[2:07:19] united group and forgiving one another
[2:07:22] and loving one another.
[2:07:26] Hallelujah.
[2:07:28] Let's love one another. Let's forgive
[2:07:30] one another. Let's bless one another.
[2:07:33] Let's love one another. Put your arm
[2:07:35] around that brother. Put your arm around
[2:07:37] the sister and say, "Amen. You my
[2:07:39] brother. You my sister, man." Tell your
[2:07:43] brother. Tell your sister. You're my
[2:07:44] sister. You're my brother, man.
[2:07:47] Oh, hallelujah. You're my brother.
[2:07:50] Brother Isaac, I love you, man. Brother
[2:07:52] Paul, you're my brother.
[2:08:06] Wow, what an anointing.
[2:08:09] You see, it's time we break the pattern.
[2:08:11] It's time we act different. Stop sitting
[2:08:14] there and being a usual thing. No, God
[2:08:16] wants you to break it. Go out of your
[2:08:18] queue and go to the someone that don't
[2:08:20] you never greet.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; The one you always taught. You must go
[2:08:24] to her and go to him.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:29] Forget about your click and your group
[2:08:32] and the one YouTube. Hey, that's
[2:08:34] nonsense, man. We all brothers and
[2:08:37] sisters. We all love one another. There
[2:08:40] ought to be no clicks in the church.
[2:08:43] No, I don't talk with that group and I'm
[2:08:46] with this group and you only chat. Come
[2:08:48] on, man. You better delete it. If that's
[2:08:51] here on your on your phone, delete your
[2:08:54] group.
[2:08:55] Come on man. I feel the Holy Ghost
[2:08:57] saying that. Not me. You heard brother
[2:09:00] Green. It should not mean the Holy
[2:09:02] Spirit.
[2:09:23] God is sick and tired of this.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And you know what? You think God don't
[2:09:27] know it.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; As I'm speaking here, he knows your
[2:09:30] thoughts.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; He know if you resenting me.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; He know if you are pushing this to a
[2:09:36] side. That's the God we serve. So you
[2:09:39] can't bluff him. You can bluff me and
[2:09:41] bluff the pastor, but you can't bluff
[2:09:43] him.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; He knows what's in your heart.
[2:09:47] And if you walk out of this convention
[2:09:49] not fixing up, brothers and sisters, I
[2:09:51] don't know what your end will be.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; But I know if you tonight surrender and
[2:09:57] say, "God, I want to go free.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; The days are so short. The coming of the
[2:10:03] Lord is upon us. The stage is set,
[2:10:06] brother. Anything can happen now.
[2:10:14] So get rid of your clicks
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; and your clan.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You know what that does? It brings
[2:10:20] division, man.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Now we leave the poor ones out and you
[2:10:24] leave the unrecognized. We leave them
[2:10:26] out.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; If you're doing that is sad. You better
[2:10:33] change tonight.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:41] So God's power is your power. So what
[2:10:43] I'm saying tonight, you can go free
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; cuz God's power is in us
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; and we can change the setup.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; You can get rid of that enemy that keeps
[2:10:52] you bound
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; because listen to what the Bible says.
[2:10:56] Greater is he that's in you
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; He that's trying to keep you bound. You
[2:11:02] stay with that problem and you stay
[2:11:04] bound.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; You know what? You walk with it for
[2:11:07] years.
[2:11:09] But it takes you one minute or a few
[2:11:11] seconds
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; to get rid of it.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; But you sitting with it for years
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; and if you just go and say forgive me,
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; it takes two seconds, two words, three
[2:11:22] words and watch you walk around for 20
[2:11:25] years, you get delivered at that same
[2:11:27] time, brother. So do it tonight,
[2:11:29] brother. Get rid of that and walk
[2:11:32] upright and watch God come your way.
[2:11:35] Watch the sick being healed. Once the
[2:11:38] miracles take place, then we are a
[2:11:40] united group with nothing in our hearts.
[2:11:49] [Applause]
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; My
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; living punctuating every sign and
[2:11:55] resurrection is coming. He's doing it
[2:11:57] today every time when the great evening
[2:11:59] lights are shining.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; He says, listen here, Satan could not
[2:12:02] take them. He could not drown drown Noah
[2:12:05] in the flood until the purpose of God
[2:12:07] had been finished. He could not burn up
[2:12:09] the Hebrew children until the purpose of
[2:12:11] God had been finished. He could not kill
[2:12:13] Job with boils and troubles until the
[2:12:15] purpose of God had been finished.
[2:12:17] Neither can he take the li to take
[2:12:19] Daniel in the lion's den until the
[2:12:21] purpose had been finished. Neither could
[2:12:24] the death and old age take Abram until
[2:12:27] the purpose of God had been finished.
[2:12:29] Neither can he take you or take me until
[2:12:32] the purpose of God is finished.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Hey brother, come on now man. He can't
[2:12:39] take you. Why are you here? Co came, he
[2:12:42] didn't take you. You were in a car
[2:12:44] accident, he didn't take you. Brother
[2:12:46] Charles, you got sick, he couldn't take
[2:12:47] you. God's purpose is
[2:12:51] Listen, man. You got a purpose on earth.
[2:12:53] You're not just here yet to fill a
[2:12:55] chair. You're not just here yet to go
[2:12:56] work and come back, but you're here yet
[2:12:58] to fulfill God's purpose. If you don't
[2:13:01] fulfill God's purpose, then you missed
[2:13:02] your you missed your chance.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; You missed it.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; But if you say, "Lord, I'm here to
[2:13:09] fulfill my purpose." What is my purpose?
[2:13:11] To be a daughter of God. To be a son of
[2:13:14] God. I live on my job like I'm a
[2:13:17] daughter of God on the college in the
[2:13:20] university. I'm a son of God. I'm a
[2:13:22] daughter of God. Then you walk like one.
[2:13:24] You talk like one. You dress like one.
[2:13:27] You look like one because you're a son
[2:13:30] and a daughter of God. Hallelujah.
[2:13:34] Hallelujah.
[2:13:36] Oh my God. We are daughters and and sons
[2:13:40] and daughters of God. Praise his
[2:13:43] wonderful name.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; My neither can he take you or me brook
[2:13:47] Isaac until the purpose of God of our
[2:13:50] life is finished. So we gather from
[2:13:52] there consolation.
[2:13:54] And why does God let troubles come and
[2:13:57] harness troubles and put bits in the
[2:13:58] mouth and makes it obey him? Are those
[2:14:01] troubles to bring us into a closer
[2:14:03] fellowship with God?
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; He says, don't now here's a quote.
[2:14:08] Don't fear, John.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Don't fear little flock.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. Don't fear, man.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Do they have that slide
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; on fear? Maybe just find out. Do they
[2:14:19] have it?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't fear little flock.
[2:14:24] All that I am, you are to.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Now, yeah, I got it.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; All my power is yours.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, brother. All my power is
[2:14:39] yours. So don't fear, little folk. My
[2:14:42] omnipotence is yours. As I stand in your
[2:14:44] midst, I have come to I didn't come to
[2:14:47] bring fear and failure, but I came to
[2:14:50] bring love and ability and courage. All
[2:14:53] power was given unto me and it's yours
[2:14:56] to use. You speak the word and I will
[2:14:59] perform it.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't say I speak the word. You
[2:15:04] speak the word. Speak the word tonight,
[2:15:07] brother. We're going to have a healing
[2:15:09] line, but speak the healing now.
[2:15:12] I don't care what you're suffering with.
[2:15:14] I don't care if it's diabetes. I don't
[2:15:16] care if it's high blood. I don't care if
[2:15:18] it's cancer. I don't care if you
[2:15:20] if you're blind, if you halt.
[2:15:23] Speak the word now.
[2:15:26] I shall be healed. I shall be delivered.
[2:15:30] You speak it and I will fulfill it.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, if you don't speak it, it
[2:15:36] stays on the books and tapes.
[2:15:38] But when you speak it,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; then I will fulfill it.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh,
[2:15:46] hallelujah. Brother Green, we have to
[2:15:48] speak it, man. We have to say it. He
[2:15:51] says here, I will perform it. That's my
[2:15:54] covenant
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; and I can never fail.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch. He says here,
[2:16:00] Israel and the church. He says here and
[2:16:03] he goes on. He says, "I believe that the
[2:16:06] there's a church on the road tonight. A
[2:16:09] power of the living God that men will
[2:16:11] speak the word here and there and it
[2:16:13] will flash like lightning." And the
[2:16:15] church is coming out not a psychologist,
[2:16:18] not some put on and make believe, but a
[2:16:20] real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost
[2:16:24] called out church.
[2:16:26] Not a false brother, not a false
[2:16:28] five-fold ministry, but a true one will
[2:16:31] speak the word and it will flash like
[2:16:33] lightning.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? If you pull on
[2:16:36] the Holy Ghost, he'll anoint me. And
[2:16:39] I'll say something and and it will go
[2:16:41] right there where you sitting.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; It will flash like light in and all of a
[2:16:46] sudden you feel anointed around you
[2:16:48] because you put on the Holy Ghost. You
[2:16:50] spoke it. You said it. And the Holy
[2:16:52] Ghost heard it. Now he anoints a
[2:16:54] minister and he speaks a word over you.
[2:16:57] My can I predict man? I'm every demon.
[2:17:01] Listen devil. We taking every spirit
[2:17:03] under our control. Everyone I don't care
[2:17:06] the people is tired. I don't care if
[2:17:08] what's wrong with them. But we taking
[2:17:10] every spirit under our control because
[2:17:13] the power that he had he gave to us.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; That general is in us.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:17:22] Praise God.
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:27] [Applause]
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; He says there's been churches, churches,
[2:17:33] brides, brides, but there's coming in
[2:17:35] one of the mechanics and dynamics.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He says you have question and
[2:17:40] answers. Oh, brother, give me a church
[2:17:42] full of the Holy Ghost. God will do in
[2:17:44] one year what the theologians failed to
[2:17:46] do in 2,000 years. He says, "You wait
[2:17:50] till the anointing of the church really
[2:17:51] strikes home." And that faithful little
[2:17:54] remnant after the doors of the Gentiles
[2:17:56] is closed. Oh, God will anoint the
[2:17:58] church then. And and he that's faith,
[2:18:01] let him be filthy still. He that's
[2:18:03] righteous, let him be righteous still.
[2:18:05] And he that's holy, let him be holy
[2:18:06] still. And God will anoint the church
[2:18:09] with the power of God. And things will
[2:18:12] take place not only then, but he's doing
[2:18:15] it now.
[2:18:18] So listen brother, we making it present
[2:18:20] tense tonight,

[2:18:30] can go free. Hey, come on, man. I see
[2:18:33] people being set free. I see the demons
[2:18:35] running, brother. I see there's no place
[2:18:37] for any enemy in this place. Why? This
[2:18:39] is holy. The ground has become holy. And

[2:19:16] The devil is under your feet. Trip on
[2:19:19] him. Walk over him. Why? He's here
[2:19:22] tonight.
[2:19:24] I feel the general speaking. It's not me
[2:19:28] speaking. We have a five-star general.

[2:20:44] [Applause]
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Is there a shout in the house?
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Satan hates worship. He wanted the
[2:21:07] worship in heaven and he was kicked out.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; So we don't worship the devil. They
[2:21:12] worship him at the discourse. They
[2:21:14] worship him there wherever they're
[2:21:15] going. But here in this house, hey, we
[2:21:18] worshiping the King of Kings. We
[2:21:20] jumping. We shouting. We happy, brother.
[2:21:23] Why? Because he's the King of Kings and
[2:21:26] he's the Lord of Lords. And only your
[2:21:29] worship will he accept, brother. Let
[2:21:31] them have the world. Let them have their
[2:21:33] nightclubs. Let them have their ochre
[2:21:35] pipes, but give us Jesus.
[2:21:41] Hallelujah.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; My
[2:21:49] he says, "Come, Lord Jesus, perfect
[2:21:50] strength. Get away your church. And if
[2:21:53] it be your will, Lord, just before the
[2:21:56] church is raptured, watch
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; what the prophecy hanging over this
[2:21:59] bride. Just before the church is
[2:22:02] raptured, may there rise what power.
[2:22:06] [Applause]
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I feel my faith muscles. I
[2:22:13] feel like you Moses going to the gym and
[2:22:16] you can see there. But I tell you, if
[2:22:18] you see me spiritually, I'm small, but
[2:22:20] you must see me inside. You'll be
[2:22:22] shocked how I'm built, brother. A small
[2:22:25] man with a big God in his heart. And I
[2:22:28] don't care how small you are. I don't
[2:22:30] care your situation. You've got a big
[2:22:32] God in you, a big general that overcame
[2:22:35] the world. So that God that's in you is
[2:22:37] greater than the world, brother, and
[2:22:39] what he has to offer you. Come on, young
[2:22:42] people. I want to tell you this. You
[2:22:44] think the world is smart and the word is
[2:22:47] good. And you see this young people with
[2:22:49] all this gold in their nose, in the
[2:22:51] earrings, and funny. I mean, how can you
[2:22:54] pierce your nose and put funny stuff in
[2:22:56] there? God didn't make you that way. But
[2:22:59] you see that's become the trend.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; It's the bling thing to do. And if it's
[2:23:03] not that, it's status.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Now they have it all over. So they have
[2:23:07] to wear these short clothes to show it.
[2:23:11] [Applause]
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, sister. Listen, brother, young
[2:23:14] person. Don't compromise to be
[2:23:16] recognized.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Don't compromise.
[2:23:22] I don't care what your peers say. I
[2:23:24] don't care how how they tell you. You
[2:23:26] look nice with it. It's a lie from the
[2:23:28] devil. Come I tell you, the world is
[2:23:31] nothing but garbage with cream on top of
[2:23:34] it, brother. And the young people see
[2:23:36] the cream, but they don't know they
[2:23:38] living off garbage.
[2:23:41] And they dying by the hundreds, man. But
[2:23:44] God has called you out. He must have
[2:23:46] some young people that is going to say,
[2:23:48] "Listen, in Trinidad, there were some
[2:23:50] young people that served me. There were
[2:23:52] some young girls and brothers that
[2:23:54] served me. Brother, come on. You're a
[2:23:56] child of God. You're a daughter of God.
[2:23:59] And the five-star general is in you.
[2:24:02] Hallelujah. Our brother said, "When you
[2:24:05] go from here, know that Jesus is always
[2:24:07] with you."
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this quote says he's
[2:24:10] in you.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Not with you, not above you, not on the
[2:24:16] side. He's in you.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; And greater is he that's in us than he
[2:24:20] that's in the world.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God, brother Olu, for those
[2:24:24] angels.
[2:24:26] Yo,
[2:24:33] [Applause]
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; wow.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; What an anointing, man.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; If it be your will, Lord, before the
[2:24:45] church is raptured, may there power, oh
[2:24:48] God, fill these vessels.
[2:24:51] Now, in order to be filled, you must be
[2:24:54] empty,
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; I can't fill this glass if it's full.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; If it's full, I can't fill it. So, you
[2:25:04] got to empty it.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Here's the empty one.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; It's empty.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; So, in order for God to fill you,
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; what must you be?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Empty.
[2:25:17] But the trouble is we some of us is so
[2:25:20] full of ourselves.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; God can't fill us.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Me, I promise we we full of the world.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; We full of television.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; We full of everything that's done in the
[2:25:32] world. So God can't fill you.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; So what you got to do? You got to die
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; and empty yourself out.
[2:25:39] And when you empty yourself out and you
[2:25:42] even shake it brother to make sure every
[2:25:44] drop is out then when you fill then God
[2:25:47] can fill you. Pour in the Holy Ghost
[2:25:49] pour in the virtues. Pour in himself and
[2:25:52] then he can fill you. But you know what
[2:25:54] Bible says? Sometimes we full of
[2:25:56] nonsense.
[2:25:59] [Applause]
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; We give the pastor unnecessary troubles
[2:26:04] because we full of nonsense.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says. Not even
[2:26:07] me. You're so full of yourself and
[2:26:10] pride. You full of nonsense.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; You come to the church and it's N. Oh,
[2:26:14] Africans. You you you cross. You're
[2:26:17] upset. You got a long face. You don't
[2:26:19] know if I can hug you. I don't know if I
[2:26:20] can shake your hand. Just come on, man.
[2:26:24] Says God's people is happy people.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; He says, you know, God's people, there's
[2:26:28] people you want to be around them. You
[2:26:30] know why? It's the atmosphere they
[2:26:32] create. You want to be in the in the
[2:26:34] atmosphere. You want to be with them.
[2:26:36] And you know, I hate somebody that looks
[2:26:39] down on the next person. Who gives that
[2:26:41] person the right to look down on the
[2:26:43] next person and speak down on them? This
[2:26:46] is God's people, man. You know, David
[2:26:48] had this against Goliath. I don't care
[2:26:50] if they were backsliden. He says, "You
[2:26:52] let this uncircumcised Philistines defy
[2:26:56] the armies of the living God." I don't
[2:26:58] care what condition they were. I don't
[2:27:01] care what was happening. They stole the
[2:27:03] armies of the living God. Woo!
[2:27:05] Hallelujah. I got to walk, brother. This
[2:27:08] is still the armies of the living God. I
[2:27:10] don't care they backsliden. I don't care
[2:27:12] they something wrong with them. They
[2:27:14] still the armies of the living God. And
[2:27:17] we challenging the devil. You
[2:27:19] uncircumcised Philistine. Let my people
[2:27:22] go.
[2:27:24] Hallelujah. Let my people go. This is
[2:27:27] God's people. This is God's sheep. And
[2:27:30] that was the thing that David had
[2:27:32] against Goliath. Don't speak against the
[2:27:35] armies of the living God.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; My my my
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; you know when when they see the church
[2:27:44] they think the church is cooled off
[2:27:45] Bruthio and then they run they run from
[2:27:48] this church to another church and they
[2:27:50] come and they find it's the same thing.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; They can't get along with someone here.
[2:27:54] They run there. They meet the same
[2:27:56] person with the same spirit.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Green, brother says he can't
[2:28:01] even adopt you.
[2:28:03] because you blown around with every wind
[2:28:05] and doctrine. This coming and there you
[2:28:07] go. The next don't come and there you
[2:28:09] go.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; But brother, you know a Christian is
[2:28:12] solid.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; He Psalms 23, I'll be like a tree that's
[2:28:17] what planted by the rivers of water. And
[2:28:20] he says you can't move him. Everything
[2:28:23] he does will prosper. He says he's
[2:28:25] watered by the nine springs of the
[2:28:27] fountain. His roots are in the water,
[2:28:29] brother. And every day you come to
[2:28:31] church, you see this man is on fire.
[2:28:33] This sister is on fire. Why? You're a
[2:28:35] tree planted by the rivers of water.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; My
[2:28:45] what a convention, man. I never felt the
[2:28:48] freedom of God to speak like this at a
[2:28:51] convention and feel the anointing only,
[2:28:54] brother. If the anointing is not there,
[2:28:56] I'll get out of the pullpit. But if the
[2:28:58] anointing is here, I'm going to say what
[2:29:00] he put on my heart. And somebody's going
[2:29:02] to go free. Somebody's going to be
[2:29:04] anointed. Somebody's going to be
[2:29:06] delivered. Somebody's going to come back
[2:29:08] and say, "Pastor, I'm free. This
[2:29:10] convention set me free.
[2:29:12] We tired, man. We as pastors, we tired
[2:29:18] struggling with people year in and year
[2:29:20] out. And there's no change.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; No change.
[2:29:28] [Applause]
[2:29:37] Come on, man.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; If you're not free, you better slam your
[2:29:41] feet. Start marching. You know what that
[2:29:44] did? Oh my. Yes. Something. You remember
[2:29:46] those lepers?
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; When they started walking,
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; God made the enemies have such a fright.
[2:29:53] They said, "The Israelites has hired
[2:29:55] more armies." But just because they were
[2:29:57] walking, God multiply their footsteps.
[2:30:00] Let's let's do it again. Hey, God is
[2:30:02] going to multiply your footsteps,
[2:30:04] brother. And the demons are going to run
[2:30:06] because they hear the rumble of God's
[2:30:09] people. Walk, brother. Walk, sister.
[2:30:12] Jump. Hallelujah.
[2:30:14] Hallelujah. God will magnify your
[2:30:17] footsteps. The demons will hear in the
[2:30:20] Trinidad. All over. There'll be revival.
[2:30:23] People will come running in. What's
[2:30:25] happening? What's happening here at
[2:30:26] Edson Tabernacle? God has magnified the
[2:30:29] footsteps. Woo! Hallelujah. Come on,
[2:30:32] brother. I feel the power of God. Yes.
[2:30:36] Come on. Just rumble.
[2:30:39] God will magnify. God will take care of
[2:30:42] the enemy. That's why you have to do
[2:30:44] nothing, man. Just follow.
[2:30:46] [Applause]
[2:31:08] I say Phil, just before the rapture, may
[2:31:11] there rise power.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God, fill these vessels. Raise them
[2:31:15] up, Lord.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Shake this world once more. We know it
[2:31:19] will be pass time. There'll be no more
[2:31:23] repentance. Now, I told you at the first
[2:31:25] meeting I preached,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; the foolish virgin came when it was too
[2:31:28] late.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Noah's day the the door was shut seven
[2:31:32] days before the rain fell.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "If this happens, it
[2:31:36] will be past
[2:31:38] repentance. Time for repentance.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; There'll be no repentance then. It will
[2:31:42] be too far up for them. But show your
[2:31:45] power, Lord. Fill these vessels, shake
[2:31:49] this world like it's never been shook
[2:31:51] before. Take your church then and leave
[2:31:54] the world in a chaos that she sits in.
[2:31:56] Hallelujah. And God is going to take
[2:31:59] this bride first. Fill them
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; today. Hallelujah.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; It can happen tonight.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; It can be in this prayer line. God fills
[2:32:06] you. Shake the world once more. He's
[2:32:09] going to shake the world. Hallelujah.
[2:32:12] Once more, Lord. Brother Isaac, once
[2:32:14] more. Shake this world. Shake Trinidad.
[2:32:18] Lord, shake the churches. Bring in the
[2:32:20] unity of the faith. Lord, let the
[2:32:23] brothers become one. Lord, let us put
[2:32:25] our differences aside and take away
[2:32:28] those grudges and malice and hatred.
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:38] And hear me your headstone. And wherever
[2:32:40] you come from, stop those clicks.
[2:32:44] I seen the trouble he did or what he
[2:32:46] does
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; cuz we only friends with so and so.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; That's why I said let's get connected
[2:32:52] this way.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; We too much this way connected.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Our phones are even full. Your phone
[2:32:58] tell you hey your phone is full.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; But we want to stay connected.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Delete.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Delete.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Delete. There's a button called delete.
[2:33:12] And if you don't have the other group on
[2:33:14] your phone, put them on your group and
[2:33:15] send them a nice message and watch the
[2:33:17] difference.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Next time that sister will come smiling.
[2:33:20] Oh, what? I got I got a I got a WhatsApp
[2:33:23] from Sister Susan. So a nice message.
[2:33:26] Why? You broke the circle.
[2:33:28] [Music]
[2:33:30] [Applause]
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; we know what we're talking about. We're
[2:33:38] all pastors. We go through this. So he
[2:33:41] says here, "Leave the world. It will be
[2:33:43] pass past time to repent."
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; You see, man is going to come when they
[2:33:48] close these doors, lock it up. It
[2:33:50] becomes a storehouse and then they're
[2:33:52] going to want to run and come to church.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Pastor, what's happening?
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac, why? Why is the church
[2:33:59] locked?
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't there no more service? Nothing was
[2:34:03] said on the chat.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; There was no poster made. What's going
[2:34:06] on?
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you find out the world
[2:34:09] counselor church has locked the church
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; cuz brother theo is not going to sign
[2:34:13] up.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you this is a reality
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; and it's moving upon us fast.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; It's moving very fast.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; It can still happen. It can be enforced
[2:34:28] this year still
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; and here here you are in this glorious
[2:34:32] meetings
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; and you're still stubborn and arrogant.
[2:34:36] Say, "Lord, break it tonight."
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; You know, God's God's love is corrective
[2:34:42] love.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Not not human passion that pet you and
[2:34:45] say, "No, you're right." God's love is
[2:34:47] corrective.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; God's love correct the error.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "The hour is close at hand."
[2:34:57] When you're going to see something
[2:34:59] happen, when something is going to take
[2:35:01] place and all this background here has
[2:35:03] only been laying a foundation for what?
[2:35:06] A short quick message to do what? To
[2:35:09] shake the nations.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; What was this message? Just to lay what?
[2:35:13] A foundation.
[2:35:15] For a short quick message to do what? To
[2:35:18] shake the nations, brother.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you heard that, man. How is
[2:35:23] God going to shake the nations?
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; Not with Donald Trump.
[2:35:28] No,
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; not with a president.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; He's going to shake the nations with
[2:35:32] you.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; God is going to shake the world and
[2:35:36] shake the world and shake the world
[2:35:39] until the grave shake loose. And before
[2:35:41] you know, here comes in brother
[2:35:42] Brennham. Here comes in my Oh, come on,
[2:35:45] man. You know the ones that died and
[2:35:48] here they come walking in. Why? Because
[2:35:50] you are going to shake the world.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; How you going to do it with the life
[2:35:55] that you live?
[2:35:58] Not the message, you know, the life that
[2:36:00] you live.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; They'll see Christ again in you once
[2:36:04] more. Again, the world will see Christ
[2:36:06] in you. The life of Christ. Bible says
[2:36:09] they said, "There goes a woman. She's
[2:36:10] just like Christ." There goes a man's
[2:36:13] just like Christ.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Where will they see Christ? In you,
[2:36:16] brother.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; I better get out here. My my my this
[2:36:25] background here has been laying a
[2:36:26] foundation for a short quick message to
[2:36:28] shake the whole nation.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Listen, I'm wanting to happen
[2:36:32] now
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; that the anointing will strike the whole
[2:36:34] church. Not some, the whole church.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; We so burdened for everyone."
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Because we see you slothful.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; We see you negligent. You just come and
[2:36:44] and there's nothing, no zeal, no fire.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; He says that will strike the whole
[2:36:49] church of the living God. She'll rise
[2:36:51] up, he says, to her feet like a mighty
[2:36:54] marching army. The sick will be healed
[2:36:57] by a word. The blind will see and the
[2:36:59] deaf will hear. The dead will be raised
[2:37:02] up and the power of God will shake the
[2:37:04] world. With the church of the living
[2:37:06] God. How's God going to shake the world?
[2:37:08] With the church of the living God.
[2:37:12] [Applause]
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:37:20] my
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; my will with the church of God. We're in
[2:37:23] the process of it right now. I believe
[2:37:26] soon coming into pass. I believe it will
[2:37:28] be just exactly that way. I believe it's
[2:37:30] going to strike the church of God soon.
[2:37:33] And it's going to start a revival that
[2:37:36] will shake the world. I believe it.
[2:37:38] Listen, brother. They'll be flying up.
[2:37:39] What's the other island? Tobago.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; And all the other islands, they'll be
[2:37:43] flying in here to find out what's
[2:37:45] happening. God has shaken the world.
[2:37:47] He's shaking Trinidad. He's shaking TNT.
[2:37:50] Listen, he doesn't need a cricket world.
[2:37:52] He doesn't need a World Cup soccer. He
[2:37:54] doesn't need that, brother. He just need
[2:37:56] a church. One man is an individual. You
[2:37:59] know, if there's going to be a revival
[2:38:01] in this church, you must say, "Lord, let
[2:38:03] me be the revival. I'm not looking for
[2:38:05] the pastor. I'm not looking for the
[2:38:07] deacons. Make me the revival."
[2:38:12] Woo! Hallelujah.
[2:38:14] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:38:17] He says here it will start revival and
[2:38:19] shake the world. I believe it.
[2:38:21] Hallelujah. Let me say this. If you
[2:38:24] count me to be a fanatic from this night
[2:38:26] on, that's the very same thing that I'm
[2:38:28] speaking of. It will be done. There'll
[2:38:30] be power put in the church. Watch. It's
[2:38:33] all back to the church.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; There'll be a power put in the church.
[2:38:37] And now he's coming in that the Holy
[2:38:40] Spirit will so anoint the people. They
[2:38:42] will speak the word and it will create
[2:38:44] itself there. We haven't seen powers
[2:38:46] like it's coming into the church and
[2:38:48] that is a fact.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain we move and don't
[2:38:53] doubt in your heart but believe that
[2:38:54] what you said will come to pass. You can
[2:38:57] have what you have said. The placing of
[2:39:00] the church in position where the
[2:39:02] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:04] comes into the church. Then the
[2:39:06] critics's mouths are going to be shut.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the dogs bark now, brother.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; But the caravan is moving on. We're
[2:39:13] going onto that power. We're going on to
[2:39:16] that anointing. He says we're marching
[2:39:18] forward. We carrying on after this
[2:39:20] meetings. We're not going to sit back.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; No, brother. We might dismiss from the
[2:39:25] convention, but we're taking the spirit
[2:39:28] with us, brother. We're taking this
[2:39:30] anointing with us. Go back to your
[2:39:32] church. Brother Olu, may you have a new
[2:39:34] church when you get back. Brother Paul,
[2:39:36] may you have a new church. Brother Theo,
[2:39:38] may your church turn around and cause a
[2:39:40] revival.
[2:39:42] And if my church is watching, may you
[2:39:45] start a revival. By the time I come
[2:39:48] back, there's a revival in the church.
[2:39:51] It takes one man, one woman that's
[2:39:53] desperate toward God.
[2:39:55] My
[2:39:57] brother Green, may there be revival in
[2:39:59] your church. We prophesy and we we knock
[2:40:02] in the demons left, right, and center.
[2:40:05] Hallelujah.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; My it won't last long.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Only a short time. Jesus came right off
[2:40:11] the mountain and straight to Calvary.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; He says here the hour is coming when
[2:40:16] this world will shake under the impact
[2:40:17] of the church of the living God
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; and moving forward in his great power.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. He says we'll step
[2:40:25] forward. I'm closing as the musicians
[2:40:26] come. He says we going and he says when
[2:40:29] the pyramid gets to the top when the
[2:40:31] full sons of God will be manifest. When
[2:40:34] the power of God will walk out. Watch
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; where's the power going to be, brother
[2:40:38] Paul? It's going to walk out.
[2:40:42] I'm going to say something. I know
[2:40:44] you're tired, but don't miss this.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus took the book, right?
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; In Luke,
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; he went into the temple. They gave him
[2:40:54] the book.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; He found the place where it was written
[2:40:56] of him
[2:40:59] [Applause]
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; and he read it,
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; closed the book,
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; gave it back to the blind ministers.
[2:41:08] And you know what he said? This day the
[2:41:11] scripture is fulfilled. What happened,
[2:41:13] brother? The word became flesh.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Where's the book tonight? It's not in
[2:41:19] New York. It's not in South Africa. It's
[2:41:22] not in Nigeria. It's not in Guateva. But
[2:41:25] you are the book. You're the book
[2:41:28] walking on two feet. You're the book
[2:41:30] that became flesh. You're the book
[2:41:32] brother Penam spoke about. You are that
[2:41:35] book. Woo. Hallelujah. Let's stamp our
[2:41:39] feet, man. Come on, brother. We walking
[2:41:41] over demons. We walking over devils.
[2:41:44] Hallelujah. Come on, man. You are the
[2:41:47] book made flesh. It's no more a quote.
[2:41:50] It's become a living manifestation.
[2:41:53] We are the book.
[2:41:56] Hallelujah.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; We are the book. Brother Paul
[2:42:01] and brother says he closed the book and
[2:42:03] he gave it back to them. to manage still
[2:42:06] a closed book.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; Close.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Close.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; They still preach six seals.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; They don't know the seven seal is open.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; And where are you? You're not under the
[2:42:19] six seals.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; You under the seventh seal.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; And when he opened the seven seal, what
[2:42:24] was there? Your names was written there.
[2:42:27] Your name is there tonight. That's why
[2:42:29] we're on our feet, brother. We shouting
[2:42:31] tonight. I saw my name. My name is under
[2:42:34] the seventh seal and under the seven
[2:42:36] seal was seven thunders and that's why
[2:42:38] I'm a part of that. I can't help to
[2:42:41] scream. I can't help to be happy,
[2:42:43] brother. I can't help to preach this
[2:42:45] way. I saw my name. Did you see your
[2:42:48] name?
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Stay to your feet. Don't sit, please.
[2:43:04] Wow. I feel anointing,
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; Andrew. I feel an anointing here, man. I
[2:43:09] feel it here. I don't know if it's there
[2:43:11] by you, but I feel the power of God is
[2:43:13] filled here. I feel the prayer line is
[2:43:15] going to be powerful. Hallelujah. And
[2:43:17] your attitude is going to determine your
[2:43:19] healing tonight.
[2:43:20] [Applause]
[2:43:21] [Music]
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave all the other quotes
[2:43:25] here. Powerful ones. Hallelujah.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Hallelujah.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Brother said this in in Harrisburg. I'm
[2:43:36] sure you remember it.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so wonderful.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; You know, there's one thing I liked in
[2:43:41] school when they had the
[2:43:45] racing. You know how they used to race
[2:43:48] and they had the 100 meter and the 200
[2:43:50] and 400. But you know what to me was the
[2:43:52] best race
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; was a relay race.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was the most beautiful one.
[2:43:59] When that came up, brother, I tell you,
[2:44:00] brother Olu, I used to like go crazy.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; It's one of the best races in in the
[2:44:05] Olympics, whatever you want.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking on my school days when
[2:44:09] I was unsaved.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; I don't go to those places now.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; But listen, man.
[2:44:17] God had seven runners. Now, normally
[2:44:19] they have four,
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; but God had had seven runners
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; to run this race.
[2:44:27] And the first one was Paul.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; He started the race.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; And maybe in those years didn't have a
[2:44:35] gun, maybe a whistle, whatever. And Paul
[2:44:37] ran, brother.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; He started running.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; And he ran in that day. And when he came
[2:44:42] to the end of the road, guess who was
[2:44:44] there?
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; He gave the baton to who?
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; Arinius.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Arinius took it and he ran. And when he
[2:44:54] came to the end, brother Paul, guess who
[2:44:56] was there? Martin
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; and Martin took it and he ran his race.
[2:45:01] When he came to the end of his, who was
[2:45:03] there?
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; Columba.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; Columbus took the pattern and he ran.
[2:45:08] When he came to the end, who was there?
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; Luther.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; And when Luther protested and he ran
[2:45:14] that race, brother, it says one thunder,
[2:45:16] he shook the whole Roman Empire.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Watch those seven thunders. If one
[2:45:20] thunder shook the Roman Empire, what the
[2:45:23] seven thunders going to do, brother?
[2:45:25] It's going to shake the world.
[2:45:28] And then Luther came to the end of his
[2:45:30] race, who was there? Wesley.
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; And when he came to the end, who was
[2:45:35] there? Elijah.
[2:45:39] [Music]
[2:45:40] [Applause]
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on now, brother.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, you better be with me. Was that the
[2:45:48] end of the race?
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; So Malachi ran.
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother. He made sure he ran
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; seven times across the world he went.
[2:45:58] But when he came to the end of his
[2:46:00] journey and his part that he had to run
[2:46:03] and then he came to the end and he said,
[2:46:04] "Listen, you here's the pattern. Say
[2:46:07] what I say. Do what the tape say. Stay
[2:46:10] with the message. Don't turn. Stay with
[2:46:13] the message. Don't blink it. Say what I
[2:46:16] said."
[2:46:18] And who was standing there?
[2:46:20] The bride.
[2:46:22] You got the message and listen brother.
[2:46:25] You say how come brother Amon the bride
[2:46:27] becomes the final voice to the final
[2:46:31] age. She takes it to the home run. So
[2:46:34] come on brother they without us. Brother
[2:46:36] Theo they not going to make it. So
[2:46:38] brother I can't give up. I got to run.
[2:46:41] Woo. I got to run. I got to go. Brother
[2:46:44] Brham is waiting for me. My wife is
[2:46:46] waiting. We got to run. Don't run back.
[2:46:49] Run forward. Come on brother. Let's run
[2:46:51] for Christ. We take it. Brother Brandham
[2:46:54] handed us the baton.
[2:46:58] Let's give the Lord a shout of praise,
[2:46:59] man.
[2:47:01] Oh, the musicians can come up.
[2:47:04] My my brother Green, he handed us the
[2:47:07] pattern
[2:47:09] and we're not going to fail.
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; Your pro, you can't fail him. Brother
[2:47:13] Bram's waiting on you and me.
[2:47:16] We love him so but he without us
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; cannot be made perfect.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; So guess who takes the final
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; we take the final stretch
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; and brother we're so close to the finish
[2:47:29] line. You can almost see hey there's the
[2:47:31] line. I can't go back now. It's nearer
[2:47:34] that way. Young people it's further to
[2:47:36] go back. I can almost see there's the
[2:47:38] finish line. And on the other side I see
[2:47:41] them waving. Woo. I see the process.
[2:47:43] Come on. Don't give up. Press on. Press
[2:47:46] on. Press on.
[2:47:49] Don't you feel like that tonight? Say,
[2:47:50] "Lord, I want to press on tonight." Just
[2:47:53] bow your head and close your eyes and
[2:47:54] say, "Lord, tonight I feel your
[2:47:56] presence. I feel your anointing. Your
[2:47:59] power is my power. Your anointing is my
[2:48:02] anointing.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; And tonight, I want to make use of that
[2:48:05] tonight." And before we come into the
[2:48:08] prayer line, you already confess your
[2:48:09] sins and say, "Lord, whatever's wrong in
[2:48:11] my life, take it out tonight." So when I
[2:48:14] come through this prayer line, I I know
[2:48:16] I fixed up. I know I met right with God
[2:48:19] tonight.
[2:48:21] So we can sing that chorus. I don't know
[2:48:25] there's going to be a prayer line.
[2:48:27] And may the church may you be blessed.

[2:48:44] somebody's going to go free. We might
[2:48:47] not see it in here now, but brother

[2:48:53] slow. You're going to see them now be

[3:46:08] [Music]
[3:46:16] I started on this journey
[3:46:20] [Music]
[3:46:23] many years ago.
[3:46:28] Oh,
[3:46:30] seen a lot of things.
[3:46:33] I seen a lot of things
[3:46:39] while traveling through and
[3:46:43] [Music]
[3:46:50] I've been through the storm
[3:46:55] and I've been through the
[3:47:01] [Music]
[3:47:04] Oh,
[3:47:06] sometimes all I try to do
[3:47:11] just seems to be in pain.
[3:47:18] [Music]
[3:47:21] What's my main concern?
[3:47:36] because
[3:47:42] I'm going on the way.
[3:47:47] There's no more. Hallelujah.
[3:47:51] And I'm careless.
[3:47:55] I guess
[3:47:58] what you do or say
[3:48:07] [Music]
[3:48:10] promise
[3:48:12] even
[3:48:14] away. I told him I follow
[3:48:23] after all that I've been through.
[3:48:27] I'll be a fool is the turn loose.
[3:48:44] Oh, I'm going all the way.
[3:48:48] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's do this second verse
[3:48:49] together. Satan comes around. Woo! Come
[3:48:53] on. Satan comes around.
[3:48:58] &gt;&gt; Playing with my mind. Just playing with
[3:49:02] my mind.
[3:49:04] He's trying to give you my daughter, but
[3:49:06] I got a job.
[3:49:09] Oh, but I got a job to do. I can't
[3:49:13] afford to waste my time. I can't afford
[3:49:16] to waste my time.
[3:49:19] There's no time to waste time.
[3:49:20] Hallelujah. He pretends to be.
[3:49:25] He pretends to be my friend.
[3:49:29] Oh,
[3:49:31] he pretends to be so kind.
[3:49:52] All right.
[3:50:02] I'm going all the way.
[3:50:07] I can't turn back now. I care less. I
[3:50:10] care less. I care less.
[3:50:14] I care less
[3:50:17] what you do or say.
[3:50:26] I made up my mind
[3:50:30] if he will lead the way. I told him I
[3:50:34] follow
[3:50:42] after all that I've been through.
[3:50:45] I feel foolish to turn it loose.
[3:50:49] my
[3:50:58] up in my mind.
[3:51:02] I'm going all the way. I'm going all the
[3:51:07] way. Going all the way.
[3:51:10] I'm going all the way to my world. Good
[3:51:15] morning.
[3:51:18] I'm going on away with my world. Good
[3:51:23] morning, glory.
[3:51:25] I'm going on away. When I get there, I'm
[3:51:30] going to tell my story.
[3:51:33] I'm going on away.
[3:51:40] I'm going on away. I got joy down in my
[3:51:46] soul.
[3:51:48] I'm going on away.
[3:51:56] I'm going all the way.
[3:52:10] Hallelujah.
[3:52:13] Glory. Can we give the Lord a shout of
[3:52:14] praise?
[3:52:16] My my
[3:52:20] season.
[3:52:26] [Music]
[3:52:31] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[3:52:35] &gt;&gt; There's a shout of the king in the camp.
[3:52:38] How many appreciate the convention?
[3:52:42] How many appreciate the Lord?
[3:52:45] Glory.
[3:52:46] [Music]
[3:52:49] So,
[3:52:50] I'm here just to I'm think I'm losing my
[3:52:54] voice.
[3:52:56] We are here just to say thank you.
[3:53:01] As brother said, we don't want to be
[3:53:03] like the lepers who never came back, but
[3:53:06] that one who said thank you.
[3:53:08] &gt;&gt; So, can we just firstly thank the Lord
[3:53:11] for making a way, for making this
[3:53:15] happen. This is nothing but the Lord.
[3:53:18] Hasn't he been good?
[3:53:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[3:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[3:53:27] Now, if I were to try to call all of the
[3:53:30] names
[3:53:31] that had a part to play, we would have
[3:53:34] quite a lot of names to call because
[3:53:37] this would have been impossible
[3:53:40] without the workers that worked behind
[3:53:43] the scenes in so many different ways.
[3:53:46] And we would have to call some teams,
[3:53:49] some different departments. But we want
[3:53:51] you to know we certainly appreciate you
[3:53:53] all for the part that you played from
[3:53:56] just worshiping to being present to the
[3:53:59] hospitality team to the different areas.
[3:54:01] We love you. We thank you. This would
[3:54:04] not be possible without you.
[3:54:09] So I believe it was Buddhan who said
[3:54:11] give your give give a round of applause
[3:54:12] just for you being here because
[3:54:16] many times we say if we just have
[3:54:18] preachers and nobody to preach to we
[3:54:20] don't have a convention
[3:54:22] &gt;&gt; and if we have the people to preach to
[3:54:23] and no preachers we don't have a
[3:54:24] convention so we need all the different
[3:54:26] parts but I really want to
[3:54:29] acknowledge firstly you may not have
[3:54:32] seen them or know they're around but I
[3:54:34] want to salute but Alino Torado in the
[3:54:36] back in the booth
[3:54:38] translating the services into Spanish
[3:54:41] for the believers who were streaming in
[3:54:43] Spanish. Brother Lo, God bless you.
[3:54:45] Thank you for coming. Thank you for the
[3:54:47] Spanish translation. And I know the
[3:54:48] believers,
[3:54:50] the Spanish speaking believers certainly
[3:54:52] appreciate him. And next to him is
[3:54:54] brother at who did the French
[3:54:56] translation for the French streaming. So
[3:54:58] the services were in English, French,
[3:55:01] and Spanish. So may the Lord bless you
[3:55:03] brothers.
[3:55:06] They preached seven services
[3:55:09] &gt;&gt; because they translated all the
[3:55:10] services. So may God renew your strength
[3:55:12] and bless you abundantly in a mighty
[3:55:15] precious name of Jesus Christ.
[3:55:18] And what can we say about the ministers
[3:55:20] who stood behind the sacred desk
[3:55:25] from the greeting to the ministry of the
[3:55:27] word from the very first service to see
[3:55:30] how God scripted what took place.
[3:55:34] You know there was no people ask
[3:55:36] sometime what's the theme of the
[3:55:37] convention
[3:55:39] and for this convention and like last
[3:55:41] year we said whatever the Lord puts upon
[3:55:43] your heart is the theme of the
[3:55:45] convention let the Lord deal and as
[3:55:47] brother Green said every gift that was
[3:55:50] born to be in its place once it in place
[3:55:52] that's God using it and didn't we see
[3:55:54] that on display over this convention
[3:55:57] from brother Joash from the very first
[3:55:59] how the service started to brother she
[3:56:02] oh what a what What a what a masterpiece
[3:56:05] of a message. What a masterpiece of a
[3:56:07] greeting. And brother Hashem is 80 years
[3:56:10] old or so. And I saw him step out behind
[3:56:12] the pulpit and I say, "Man, God give us
[3:56:14] more preachers like brother Joash and
[3:56:16] brother Shem. You appreciate those
[3:56:18] brothers.
[3:56:20] Brother Joash, if you're listening,
[3:56:22] Brother Shem, God bless you. We love you
[3:56:24] and appreciate you." And then the second
[3:56:27] service, how many appreciate brother
[3:56:28] Yadel Thornne who stood and oh what a
[3:56:32] what a powerful greeting and our
[3:56:34] precious brother Stephan Skull and Rena
[3:56:36] who brought the message on that night.
[3:56:38] What a time in the presence of the Lord.
[3:56:41] And then yesterday morning, brother
[3:56:42] Norris. Brother Norris is still here
[3:56:43] with us. Brother Norris, we salute you
[3:56:46] for putting your shoulder to the wheel.
[3:56:49] And then brother Raymond Thomson man if
[3:56:52] I tell you brother Raymond is an
[3:56:53] inspiration to us. Brother Raymond,
[3:56:55] thank you for for coming all the way
[3:56:57] from South Africa to be a blessing.
[3:57:00] Amen. And then, Brother Paul Onan Jacob
[3:57:03] from Ivory Coast. I appreciate Brother
[3:57:05] Paul.
[3:57:10] Amen. And brother Andrew Furong who came
[3:57:12] next. Brother Andrew, we thank you for
[3:57:13] the greeting.
[3:57:15] Amen.
[3:57:17] How do I
[3:57:21] &gt;&gt; But
[3:57:23] [Music]
[3:57:24] Thank you.
[3:57:29] Amen.
[3:57:31] Amen.
[3:57:33] It's just so humbling. And and you know,
[3:57:35] I was speaking to a few friends and I
[3:57:39] said the attacks on families, on homes,
[3:57:43] on marriages, on parents
[3:57:46] have been unprecedented.
[3:57:49] We have lost many. And there are many
[3:57:51] wounded soldiers. They're coming to
[3:57:53] church, but they are wounded soldiers.
[3:57:55] And it's a real burden in our hearts
[3:57:57] because we are promised our families.
[3:58:01] &gt;&gt; And I believe to give comfort to all of
[3:58:03] us in this meeting knowing we are
[3:58:05] leaving with the devil under our feet,
[3:58:07] not one will be left behind. And if that
[3:58:09] is one thing we leave this meeting with
[3:58:11] is God is going to bless you for
[3:58:14] standing with this message in the face
[3:58:16] of every obstacle. So may God continue
[3:58:19] to bless you. And then this morning to
[3:58:22] have a greeting from brother Nigel
[3:58:23] alert. You appreciate brother Nigel and
[3:58:29] and then this morning brother Olu's
[3:58:30] message. Brother Olu, this is his
[3:58:32] church. They are blended with us here in
[3:58:35] Hes Tabernacle. And then what can we say
[3:58:38] about tonight? Our precious brother
[3:58:40] Albert Green. You appreciate brother
[3:58:41] Green
[3:58:43] [Music]
[3:58:44] and with the Raymond coming again to cap
[3:58:46] it all off. What a tremendous time in
[3:58:48] the Lord. and then to see how the Lord
[3:58:51] orchestrated because every service had a
[3:58:54] different song leader. You appreciate
[3:58:55] the song leaders
[3:59:00] and behind the scenes a lot of what
[3:59:02] transpired I can tell you was not
[3:59:04] planned. It was just the Lord moving
[3:59:06] things around.
[3:59:08] The best plan on paper just crumbled
[3:59:10] when the Holy Ghost said this is how
[3:59:12] it's going to happen.
[3:59:14] and to see it unfolded in a way that
[3:59:16] there are things that happened that we
[3:59:17] had no control over and we could see God
[3:59:19] saying, "No, that's not what I want."
[3:59:20] And whatever God wanted is what
[3:59:22] happened. So, I can tell you without a
[3:59:24] shadow of a doubt, there was no paper
[3:59:26] that spoke of what you saw this weekend.
[3:59:29] The paper that was written, that paper
[3:59:31] was destroyed because the Lord had how
[3:59:33] he wanted it. So, I want to salute all
[3:59:35] the song leaders from brother Zoe to
[3:59:38] brother Anthony. You appreciate those
[3:59:40] brothers.
[3:59:42] To brother Gideon, to brother Sirill.
[3:59:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To brother
[3:59:51] Ofnneel.
[3:59:53] It's so many of them. I forget to
[3:59:54] brother Steven Olive and to brother Fei.
[3:59:57] Every gift was different. The way the
[4:00:00] Holy Spirit was able to move through
[4:00:02] each one. So, we appreciate all of the
[4:00:05] song leaders. And then the musicians.
[4:00:07] There were some rotations in there. But
[4:00:10] every service you salute the musicians
[4:00:14] [Music]
[4:00:18] cuz all these are different ministries
[4:00:20] that without them you can't have the
[4:00:21] meeting.
[4:00:22] &gt;&gt; So from sister Naomi Maxshine,
[4:00:26] Sister Eden Hernandez on the violin
[4:00:29] because all the gifts just they were in
[4:00:31] and out but God was just moving in and
[4:00:33] out. So, brother Anthony O'Brien,
[4:00:36] brother Oil, brother Mvin Otley, brother
[4:00:38] David Azima, Daniel Olofin, brother
[4:00:40] Gideon Oin, brother Steven Oliver,
[4:00:42] brother Michael Blackman, brother Andy
[4:00:44] Henry, brother Michael Thomson, brother
[4:00:46] Ethan Balbosa, all of the different
[4:00:48] gifts.
[4:00:51] What can we say? Faith comes by hearing.
[4:00:56] [Music]
[4:00:59] Right now, those technicians have a lot
[4:01:00] of power because they can cut off this
[4:01:03] thing here right now. So, we thank God
[4:01:05] that during the convention, they never
[4:01:07] cut us off and not only made it work,
[4:01:10] but was able to coordinate all of the
[4:01:12] logistics of the different songs. We
[4:01:14] want to salute brother Daniel Bishop,
[4:01:16] brother Timothy, brother Francis
[4:01:18] Timothy, brother Timothy Granville,
[4:01:20] brother Jesse Utley, brother Ian Paul
[4:01:22] Francis, brother Nicholas Citaram,
[4:01:24] brother Adrien Joseph, brother Steven
[4:01:26] Thompson, brother Shane Williams,
[4:01:28] brother Kenneth Bullis, brother Jose
[4:01:30] Noak Puddter. It was a blended team and
[4:01:33] they worked so well together. God bless
[4:01:35] you. We thank you. We love you for the
[4:01:39] streaming and the sound and all of the
[4:01:42] cameras and all of those things. What
[4:01:44] what a grace of God to us. And for the
[4:01:47] ministers that are here and those I want
[4:01:49] to acknowledge. I I think I saw him. He
[4:01:51] may not be here now, but brother Peters
[4:01:53] uh was here with us this afternoon, but
[4:01:55] the MelchzDC is here with us still.
[4:01:57] Brother Norris, Brother Harry, Brother
[4:01:59] Andrew, and for the many ministers that
[4:02:02] passed through the meeting, whether
[4:02:03] Nigel Alert, Brother Joash, Brother
[4:02:06] Shem, Brother Thornell, Brother Yadel,
[4:02:09] Brother Richard, Brother Roland, Brother
[4:02:10] Tuxing, uh, Brother Rat and George. We
[4:02:14] appreciate all of the ministers who were
[4:02:16] in for the different services
[4:02:19] and for the believers that came from the
[4:02:22] different fellowships. We thank you all.
[4:02:25] What can we say about the hospitality
[4:02:27] team and the food and the preparation?
[4:02:34] I want to give acknowledgement to Sister
[4:02:36] Oid and to my wife, Sister Karen. I
[4:02:39] don't even think they're upstairs
[4:02:40] because they're getting prepared for us
[4:02:41] to go down.
[4:02:44] So, we thank them and the teams and all
[4:02:46] of the maintenance team, the the
[4:02:48] building and the landscaping and the car
[4:02:50] park attendant and the medical team. You
[4:02:53] know, we we had a conversation around
[4:02:55] people, you know, sometimes have a
[4:02:56] medical situation and they have a a
[4:02:58] triage process. We pray first, then we
[4:03:01] test.
[4:03:04] So, they have all the blood pressure
[4:03:05] things and the all these things there,
[4:03:07] but the first the first response is get
[4:03:09] the elders to pray, then we check your
[4:03:11] blood pressure.
[4:03:13] So, we thank all the medical teams that
[4:03:15] have been supporting those and all of
[4:03:17] the pieces working in such harmony and
[4:03:19] such unity. And you could just think it
[4:03:20] as we get nearer to the headstone. It's
[4:03:22] one Lord. It's one faith. It's one body.
[4:03:24] And brother Brandham said, "One day the
[4:03:25] water will rise so high that the ducks
[4:03:27] will just fellowship." And it's such a
[4:03:29] beautiful thing to fellowship, the unity
[4:03:32] of the spirit before we see the unity of
[4:03:34] the faith.
[4:03:35] &gt;&gt; So I don't believe I hope I'm not
[4:03:37] forgetting anything. How many appreciate
[4:03:40] our host pastor
[4:03:42] [Applause]
[4:03:53] But Oie, we love you. We appreciate you.
[4:03:59] And
[4:04:01] I want to salute two special brothers as
[4:04:03] well. Before I get to them, I want to
[4:04:05] appreciate the team that handle the
[4:04:06] transport and the logistics for moving
[4:04:09] the believers from the hotel to the
[4:04:11] service and all the different things.
[4:04:13] And you know there's a lot that goes
[4:04:15] behind the scene. I want to want to
[4:04:16] release to brother Steven Olive. I don't
[4:04:18] know where he is. Is brother Steven
[4:04:19] upstairs
[4:04:21] hiding. He's hiding in the back. You
[4:04:24] know Steven's role is so important that
[4:04:26] this list that I'm working off of. He
[4:04:29] did it.
[4:04:31] That's how much of a support he is to
[4:04:33] what I have to do. But the role that he
[4:04:36] plays is not even here. He's trying to
[4:04:37] confuse me so that I forget and I'm like
[4:04:41] I know I'm missing something. But there
[4:04:43] are two brothers who are really critical
[4:04:45] in supporting my role and that's brother
[4:04:48] Steven Oliveri our administrative elder.
[4:04:50] Brother Steven, God bless you. Thank you
[4:04:53] for your support. Thank you for all the
[4:04:55] WhatsApp messages at 1:00 a.m. 1000 p.m.
[4:04:59] 5:00 a.m.
[4:05:01] He has this way of reminding you.
[4:05:04] God bless you. Receive and brother Mike
[4:05:06] Blackman who's our operational director.
[4:05:09] these two brothers
[4:05:12] because I always say the best what the
[4:05:14] best place plans come under fire and
[4:05:17] whenever anything goes out of line those
[4:05:18] are the two brothers I call and very
[4:05:21] seldom do we need to we need to escalate
[4:05:23] it to to the pastor but we really
[4:05:25] appreciate brother Steven and brother
[4:05:26] Mike Blackman for their support
[4:05:31] I believe that should be it now
[4:05:36] anything else is it
[4:05:38] So
[4:05:40] wonderful. So may the Lord richly bless
[4:05:42] you. And I want to call our host pastor
[4:05:45] to close us out in a word of prayer. And
[4:05:48] uh
[4:05:49] [Music]
[4:05:51] &gt;&gt; what?
[4:05:56] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[4:05:58] Thank you. Thank you.
[4:06:01] They were going to lynch me after
[4:06:03] service.
[4:06:06] [Music]
[4:06:08] I really want to salute our head deacon
[4:06:11] and all of the deacons and the ushers
[4:06:13] and what we saw was really unique
[4:06:17] because we had a blended team of deacons
[4:06:20] from Hon Tabernacle and from Lagos and
[4:06:23] you couldn't tell them apart and you
[4:06:24] know when you're from one body when you
[4:06:26] can't tell them apart. So we really
[4:06:28] salute the deacons and the ushers.
[4:06:35] Amen. So I believe that should be it.
[4:06:38] And uh you know we do have the
[4:06:41] hospitality told me the hospitality team
[4:06:43] told me to make sure and bless the
[4:06:45] refreshments
[4:06:46] because we want to make sure we have
[4:06:48] enough. So let's bless.
[4:06:51] So in closing prayer but over if there
[4:06:54] ever was a time
[4:06:57] that we needed a miracle it's
[4:07:00] but we believe we have something for
[4:07:01] everyone. So we want we want you to
[4:07:04] leave here happy in joy and knowing that
[4:07:06] God has a plan and a place for you. So
[4:07:08] may the Lord rich you bless you. Thank
[4:07:09] you for coming but over.
[4:07:15] Amen. Let's stand.
[4:07:19] [Music]
[4:07:22] So I want to just leave this with you as
[4:07:25] we pray.
[4:07:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless thee and keep thee. Amen.
[4:07:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord make his face shine upon thee
[4:07:32] &gt;&gt; and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift
[4:07:35] up his countenance upon thee and give
[4:07:37] thee peace. Let's pray. Father, we thank
[4:07:38] you for your love and your presence and
[4:07:41] your grace towards us. And I pray as the
[4:07:44] believers go to their homes and various
[4:07:45] places that you would bless them in a
[4:07:47] special way. And Father God, the meal,
[4:07:50] whatever have been prepared, may it
[4:07:51] sanctify it. May give strength to our
[4:07:53] bodies on life service. We commit them
[4:07:55] to thee, Father. We take the word and
[4:07:57] place it over them that the church will
[4:07:59] be strengthened that each pastor, each
[4:08:01] minister would be empowered by your
[4:08:03] spirit to lead the people where you want
[4:08:05] them to go. Granted, Father, in Jesus I
[4:08:08] ask it. Amen. God bless you. May have
[4:08:10] your seats as the ushers come forward.
