the name of the lord you may be seated for a few minutes you could keep playing softly what an anointing what an atmosphere what a presence we feel isn't it good to be in the house of the lord this morning you know i asked brett gideon to sing that song and um he had shared and many of you would have heard it before but when i read it it just resonated with me one more time [Music] the journey of life and how you have to really be grounded in god and have trust in god especially when things don't go the way you might expect so you share this with me and did you know the song it is well with my soul was written by a successful christian lawyer horatio spafford his only son had died at the age of four in 1871 and in 1872 the great chicago fire wiped out his vast estate that he had made from his legal career and then in 1873 just another year later he sent his wife and his four daughters over to europe on a summer trip on the ill-fated ss will they have a ship since he had a lot of work to do he planned to follow them later but the ship sank and he lost his four daughters with the wife being the only survivor she sent him a famous telegram which simply read saved alone on his return home his law firm was burned down and the insurance company refused to pay him they said it was an act of god he had no money to pay for his house and no work he also lost his house then while sitting and thinking what's happening to him being a spiritual person he wrote a song whatever my lord you have taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul and i'm standing here today and we are all standing here today no matter what we have been through the lord has taught us to see he has taught us to say it is well it is well it is well it is it may not be well with my house but it is well with my soul it may not be well with my cow but it is well with my soul my business my job this that it may not be well with that but you have taught me to say it as well with my soul is that your testimony this morning oh can we give the lord a praise offering oh lift your hand and say thank you jesus thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord father we praise you father we worship you father we thank you for the trials we thank you for the testing we thank you for the ups and the towns lord we thank you that it is well with our souls this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord he may be seated thank you so much musicians it's good to be in the house of the lord like to greet one and all in the precious theme of jesus christ it's certainly a great privilege to be gathered in fellowship one more time in such a time like this and we don't count it for granted we don't take it for granted because we see so many things are changing around us we see the issues that have prevailed for some time continue to manifest itself in a way that humanity is being challenged and unless you have something that grounds you that anchors you that keeps you seen you'll go insane men's hearts feeling for fear people wondering how to live how to move what to do how to act but we have a comfort this morning and our comfort is not in church our comfort is not in a belief our comfort is in the lord jesus christ who promised to take care of us promised to never leave us never forsake us he promised to be with us even in us hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so i greet you in the name of jesus christ and i certainly want to wish a happy birthday to our precious pastor uh pastor theophilus ovid amen yesterday was his birthday so we thank god you appreciate your pastor hallelujah the gift of god that god has please in our midst and we love him and appreciate him and on behalf of the church we wish him many more years of health and strength and more than that to be more yielded to god as a vessel in this hour because the word tells us there'll be a famine in the last days for the hearing of the true word of god but i believe in my heart that god has blessed us with a pastor after his own heart can the church say man who stands in season out of season it doesn't matter what wind blows he is firmly rooted oh hallelujah on the promises of god oh for this end-time bride and for this local church so we love him and appreciate him and um the family we we sent him to get all the rest we send him to get a little rest so he's not here in the tabernacle this morning but if i know him he is connected on the under on the hook up this morning so we want to just remember him as well so are you ready for the word this morning let's all stand to our feet as we approach the holy scripture this morning and such a blessing how many appreciate last week sunday's message getting to the golden altar what a masterpiece of a message and we see the holy spirit as till in the corner and we are moving with the cloud this morning so reading two portions of scripture reading from first peter two and reading uh from verse nine first peter two and reading from verse nine ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that he should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy and let's go to the book of revelation chapter five in reading from verse one revelation five and reading from verse one and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel caming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing it neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders say it unto me weep not behold a lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof and i be held and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god send forth into all the it and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou were slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray heavenly father we thank you this morning to be gathered lord in your presence lord lord you have said in your word that where there are two or three gathered in your name there you are in the midst of them so we thank you this morning that you are able to bring us to this spot this this this this crossroads as it were as we continue along this journey lord this journey that will take us to adoption and perfection and oh god the millennium and the new city and the rapture and every redemptive promise in the book father so now may you take me out of the way and speak to your children may you hide me behind calvary's cross may you touch your people both here those that are on the internet and those that may watch the tape me lord she kind of glory that august presence dropped down wherever your sons and daughters may be gathered even in other fellowships today may the holy ghost slow light and lord flash through the world lord as we prepare to leave this place we are not satisfied with just being in church we are not just satisfied in knowing what's about to happen but we want to be participators lord in what is about to happen we want to be active participants father we want to do our part we are reporting for duty this morning may you lord open your word to us we commit this service into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord and uh i have a title this morning the aaronic the ironic priesthood the melchizedek priesthood and the royal priesthood the aaronic priesthood the melchizedek priesthood and the royal priesthood and a subject understanding the priesthood that you are born unto and an inspiration the great high priest and the kingdom of priests and the church say amen so i'm connecting to brother ovid's message last sunday when he preached on getting to the golden altar and what our foundation for a corner being turned into spirit and he made a powerful statement that the way back to eden is by the altar and through the altar and we would have explored in that message and in bible study as well that moses would have been caught up to mount sinai and he was given instructions god in his mind had a plan for how things are to unfold and the thing about god he's a god of progressive revelation so he doesn't give everything all at once he doesn't reveal everything all at once he drops something here and then somebody picks it up later on and then all of a sudden it begins to make sense but but he has to drop it there so that it could be picked up somewhere else he is so much ahead of our thinking that he could drop little secrets along the journey that only when you need to connect back to the secret it needs to be called up at that point to make sense can the church say amen so isaiah would say a virgin will conceive and that hung there nobody knew what to do with it it was just there it was just in the records hallelujah but when the time came they could find where it was written peter on the day of pentecost could say this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel it was sitting there in the word for year after year people knew it was there they knew it was written but nobody knew what to do with it can the church say man so god in unfolding things to us he is smarter than us he is bigger than us he's bigger than the devil he's bigger than your problem he's bigger than your situation he's bigger than your triumph he understands how he wants this thing to unfold up and to ensure that no devil could stop it he does things a certain way he moves a certain way he operates a certain way can the church say amen blessed be the name of the lord so we know that moses was caught up in mount sinai for forty days and forty nights he was there and god was communion communing with his servant moses hallelujah we read this uh in bible study as well in the last bible study and this is in exodus 24 hallelujah and moses went up into the mount this is verse 15 and the cloud covered the mount and the glory of the lord aboard upon mount sinai and the cloud covered it six days and seven day he called moses into the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel and moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him into the mount and moses was in a mount 40 days and 40 nights what did god call moses aside for for all those days under that anointing it was to show moses what had to happen to reveal to moses what had to take place god wasn't leaving into accident he wasn't leaving it to chance he was given specific instructions because the work of redemption had to continue he was not going to leave man without a way to get back to fellowship he was not going to leave man without a way to get back into relationship he was not going to leave man without a way of redemption he wasn't going to leave man without a plan and a process and a procedure and an approach so he didn't want man to come up with his own thing he didn't want man to come up with his own way of worship he didn't want man to invent his own strategy or come up with his own system or sit down and plan what he wanted god in his mind knew what he wanted up he always knew what he wanted he's not now deciding what he wants he knows what he wants up he knows how he wants you to worship he knows how he wants you to live he knows how he wants you to overcome he knows that your family has got to come back he knows that the power of sin has got to be broken from your life he knows that sickness can't have a grip on you until the line is crossed there's a line that the devil can't pass up that is a line that sin cannot pass there's a line that sickness cannot pass and god knows it before you even hear he knew it before you even born he called you before you even knew yourself can the church say amen [Music] blessed be the name of the lord so we read it in bible study exodus 25 and brother overread this and the lord spake unto moses i'm not going to go into all of it i'm just laying the background speak unto the churn of israel and he began to explain about the tabernacle and the building of the tabernacle we know exodus 25 exodus 26 exodus 27 all of it is laying out the tabernacle and the priesthood and how they have to live and how they have to do the sacrifice and what they must have if you say blue it's blue if you say purple it's purple if you say gold is gold if you say what is wood whatever he said it's the way to do it you can bring what you want and say this is all i have it was whatever god said that's what he wanted the approach to the sacrifice was the way he wanted it whatever he said you had to do it that way can the church say amen so the way back to eden was by the altar and truly altar but the only way for man to get into communion with god god had to have a priesthood that was established because the priest had to perform the sacrifice you couldn't just get up and do your own sacrifice anybody with me this morning he established a priesthood so that the priests we know it once a year would go and make a sacrifice for the people they would make a sacrifice for themselves they would make a sacrifice for the people isn't that right so this establishing of the priesthood was very critical to god's plan but even before we reach exodus 24 25-36 rewind the tape and in exodus 19 verse 3 god says so in verse 3 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shall thou say to the house of israel and tell the children of israel you have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure oh hallelujah unto me above all people for all the earth is mine isn't that right and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests so there was a prophecy hovering over them to be a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel so there's a prophecy hovering over them to be a kingdom of priests it's worse to them because they don't understand how this is going to unfold they don't understand how this is going to come to pass because at the time that god has given moses this and moses speaking to these people the israel has no king they can't call themselves a kingdom there has been no priesthood established but there's a prophecy hanging over them ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests no king yet no high priest yet but ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and that's how god always operates it doesn't matter what you have now it doesn't matter what you're seeing with your eyes god could prophesy over you when there's nothing around you to support the prophecy because he sees beyond you he sees beyond the present tense he sees beyond your present problem he shall be unto me a kingdom of priests just like he spoke to abraham you're gonna have a son there's no evidence of sonship there's no evidence to sarah there's no evidence to abraham but that doesn't stop the prophecy oh hallelujah when god says you're going to have the holy ghost when he says you're going to have a revival when he says you're going to get a breakthrough when he says you're going to have joy unspeakable and full of glory he's not speaking to your situation he's not speaking based on what you see he's speaking in prophetic knowing what will happen knowing what will unfold can the church say amen so israel is on the prophecy they have no king they have no high priest but god already spoke about a kingdom of priests or kingdom of priests hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and god is beginning to drop certain things to them to prepare for this kingdom not any kind of kingdom not a kingdom but just kings and subjects for the kingdom of priests because in this kingdom of priests will be priest kings hallelujah a kingdom made up of priests and those priests will also be kings hallelujah these kings were reported a king of kings and these priests will be accountable to a high priest [Music] but it'll be a kingdom of priests what kingdom do you belong to i belong to a kingdom of priests hallelujah hallelujah this worldly kingdom can't hold me this kingdom of the world is not my home i belong to a heavenly kingdom a kingdom of priests priests and king rulership and holiness rulership and sanctification rulership and living in order rulership unable to perform the sacrifice authority and power power and the ability to stand as a representative for me and my house i'm a priest i'm a king don't you know who you are that you are born to be a king born to be a priest and that's why the devil hates you so much because we are race of priests kings no other people like this people no other church like this church can the church say man i'm trying to build into something are you with me this morning that's why it's a royal priesthood because his king priest is a royal priesthood no other priesthood has been like this priesthood in that same exodus 19 which we read which says ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation by verse 22 and this is where i want to kind of kind of drill down a little bit if you would have me this morning exodus 19 and verse 22 and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them so we see a situation where the priests which have to come near to the lord you can't come anyhow you can't come any way you want to you have to come sanctified you have to come with your life in order because you are a priest because if you don't come right god will break forth upon you so it is not just a sacrifice to be accepted but the priests also have to be accepted with how the priest lives and how the priest walks and how the priest talks and how sanctified their life is as a priest so this is what god was laying down at the time for the aaronic priesthood they didn't know then that they were just a type or a shadow or an example of a priesthood to come because in that day only certain people could be a priest but in our day it's different you are all priests so the sanctification and the walk and the talk and the life you are also held to that same standard you can go where you want to go you can do what you want to do you can live how you want to live you can act the way you want to act because you are kings and priests because of your kingship you have to act like royalty you have to act because you understand that you're a king and you understand your authority and you understand you have a royal lineage and you understand where you come from and understand that nowhere performed against you could prosper because you are a king and you have authority because of your lineage because who your father is because of your relationship with the king of kings and as a priest you can't stand what is not holy you are bothered you are you are sick of the things of this world because you are priests and and around you are bells that are shaken holy holy holy holy is the lord god almighty holy holy holy where you walk is holy holy holy holy holy lord god almighty you are careful with what you say you are careful with what you do you are careful with how you live can the church say amen we are building into something in exodus 28 the bible says this is god's instruction to moses exodus 28 and verse 1 and take thou unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of israel that he may minister in unto me in the priest's office even aaron nadab and abihu eliezer and ithama aaron's sons so god told moses call aaron and his four sons that he may minister unto me in the priest's office and verse 2 and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron so aaron can't dress how he wants the dress thou shalt make holy garments for aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty hallelujah we're talking about the aaronic priesthood now so god is saying aaron is going to be a priest but as a priest and he and his sons they have to dress a certain way so that everybody will know that they are priests there will be no doubt about the fact that they are priests their walk will speak priests their talk will speak priests their lives will speak priests their dress will speak priests listen carefully and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office and these are the garments where they shall make a breastplate and an effort and a robe and a brighter coat a mitre and a girdle and they shall make holy garments for aaron thy brother and his sons that he may minister in unto me in the priest's office and they shall take gold and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and they shall make the effort of gold of blue and of purple of scarlet and fine twine linen not any kind of linen but fine twine linen with cunning work so he said get the skilled workers because this priesthood is so important that there are specific colors tied to the priesthood there's a specific dress tied to the priesthood there's a specific way that this comment must be put together for the priesthood anybody with me we're building into something it shall have two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof and so it shall be joined together and the curious girdle of the ephod which is upon it shall be of the same according to the work thereof even of gold of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twine linen and thou shall take two onyx stones and grave on them the names of the children of israel six of their names and one stone and the other names under of the rest on the other stone according to their birth so don't mix up the order of put don't arrange it how you want to arrange it don't come to church how you want to come to church don't approach this gospel the way you want to do it god has an order he has an approach this is a priestly office and we are called in this hour for our priestly office oh hallelujah verse 11 with the work of an engraver in stone like the engravings of a signet thou shalt engrave the two stones with the names of the children of israel thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold and thou shall put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of israel and aaron shall bear their names before the lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial and thou shall make ouches of gold and two chains of pure gold at the ends of rhythm work shall don't make them and fasten the reverend chains to the ultras and thou shall make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the ephod thou shall make it of gold of blue of purple and of scarlet and a fine twine lineage shall thou make it four square it shall be being doubled a span shall be the land thereof and a span shall be the bread thereof and thou shalt set in its settings of stone even four rows of stones the first four shall be sadius a topaz and a cabuncle this shall be the first row and the second row shall be an emerald a sapphire and a diamond and a turtle a lager and a cat and an amethyst and the fourth row of burial this is god's instructions you know and you want to come to church how you want to come to church live how you want to live and god has taken care of the details of this office of the priesthood anybody with me so i'm going to move on a bit from that just so you get it and then by by the t and all in exodus 20 it goes on by the time exodus 29 god gives specific instructions and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them to minister unto me in the priest's office take one young bullock and two rams without blemish and unleavened bread and cakes unleavened tempered with oil and wafers unleavened anointed with oil of wheat and flour and he goes on and by the time he reached exodus 30. anybody with me we reach the altar and gods give specific instructions about the altar exodus 30 and verse 7 and iran shall burn their own sweet incense every morning not the mornings if he like it not the mornings he gets up early enough every morning when he dresses the lambs he shall burn incense upon it and when aaron lighted the lambs at the evening he shall burn incense upon it and over touch on this last week a perpetual incense before the lord throughout your generations in other words this should not stop this should keep on going verse 9 he shall offer no strange incense thereon no burn sacrifice no meat offering neither shall you pour drink offering thereon and aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in a year shall we make atonement upon it throughout your generations it is most holy unto the lord i want to pause at exodus 30 verse 9 he shall offer no strange incense thereon strange incense the instructions that were given in exodus 28 were fulfilled in leviticus chapter 8. so if you compare exodus 28 to leviticus 8 you will see this parallel one bull two rams basket of unleavened bread you will see aaron and his sons have to wash and put on the priestly garments the bull has to be offered as a sin offering and the parallel is there but i want to go to leviticus 10 to verse 1. so this is after the appointment and the placing of the priesthood leviticus 10 and verse 1 and nadab and abihu the sons of iran took either of them his censor and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not so as a priest so these are priests we're talking about now so god was very clear priests had to come from the tribe of levites and these priests and there's a special responsibility of the sons of aaron and aaron and his house as the chief levites if you want to say that of the house of the high priest and he's a two now of iran's sons nadab and abihu the sons of iran took either of them his censor and put fire therein and put incense there around and offered strange fire the bible didn't tell us what the fire was they just said it was strange before the lord which he commanded them not and they went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord so i want us to see this friends israel is now being instructed on the priesthood and the tabernacle and then not too long after that you see two sons of aaron approaching things in a way that they should not approach it and israel is shaken when fire goes from the lord and devoured them and he died before the lord and moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord speak saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace so church i'm challenging us because we are priests and kings be very careful in this hour because the closer we get to this climax that we are living and we are walking into and we read it in the book of revelations when that book was taken they sang a new song that we are made kings and priests and as a priest we have to walk a certain way and moses called michelle and elsa found the sons of uzielda's uncle of aaron and senator them carrie come near carry your bridge in from before the sanctuary out of the camp live these dead boys out does this remind you of ananias and sapphira two people there in the old testament strange incense offered ananias and sapphira the two of them come and lie before the holy ghost and they went there and carried them in their coats they're still in their coats out of the camp as moses had said can the church say amen no i want to draw your attention to this were the oldest of iran's four sons god made a promise to aaron that you and your sons will be the ones responsible for this but the strange fire they burnt didn't change the covenant that god had and his word about how you approach him everyone couldn't say but lord he promised me my sons would do this they offered strange incense strange fire these same sons were privileged to be with moses and their father along with the others to mount sinai so in exodus 24 i'm laying this foundation in exodus 24 this is before moses went up to get the instructions and he said unto moses come up unto the lord thou and iran nail up and abu and seventy of the elders of israel and worship he are far off so these two boys were there they were part of the elite club as it were who were close to moses when the whole of israel it's gathered to one side aaron and his sons these two sons were there as witnesses in exodus 24 verse 9 then went up moses and iran nadab and abihu and 70 of the elders of israel and they saw the god of israel these two priests who offered strange incense they saw the god of israel they had an experience and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand also they saw god and did eat and drink and the lord senator moses come up so nadab and abihu had been called they had witnessed they had experience they had eaten before the lord they had stood next to moses and god killed them the moment they offered strange incense the moment they came and offered a sacrifice that god said don't offer it that way i want to nail down you have to understand how serious this priest is done walking around saying i'm a king and i'm a priest and i'm a royal priesthood this is not a statement friends it's a life it's a testimony it's a walk with god that has to stand up to the word of god you couldn't say well lord he was with you right there on the mountain [Music] we don't know how long they had been ordained as priests but it would not have been too long they were operating the bible doesn't tell us exactly what was strange about their offering but it just says it was strange and it was what the lord had commanded them to not do no wonder the prophet said full obedience to the entire word of god is what entitles you to the token they were ordained as priests they had walked with moses they were aaron's son and they still missed the message of the hour and as their office of priests they made a choice it was not an accident they sin by offering strange fire before the lord disobeying god's command there must have been some agreement between the two of them because for both of them to be killed by the pop well it meant they were complicit in each other's actions as a priest one could have said to the other that's not what god said i'm not going with you but the report agreed to do it how many times do we make decisions based on somebody else it's one thing to read this scripture and say nahab was guilty but they're both guilty they both did the same thing that was wrong and the act they did together they were also judged together for it not because somebody agrees with you or tells you it's okay makes it okay you have to check the word of god to see if this is a strange fire is this is this the way god wants me to live in this season this season has changed friends we have turned the corner the only way back to eden is by the altar and through the altar if there was an ever i want to understand the responsibility of your priestly role in the kingdom of god it's now can the church say amen what this highlights when you look at it friends under that aaronic priesthood you know there are many different jobs you could have even in the chives of israel some tribes were farming tribes some tribes were fishing tribes some tribes were rearing animals and it would have its own difficulties its own challenges the tribe of judah was known as a warrior tribe but all of a sudden the job of a priest and being born of the lion of the levites and being a son of iran was now one of the riskiest professions because if your walk was not right it was death if your life wasn't right it's death if your words are not right it's death if your offering is not right it's dead if you burn strange incense before the lord it's dead the most dangerous job was being a priest because god required the best he required his word he required his statutes he required his laws he required you to be understanding of who he was and what he was can the church say amen to be in the ironic priesthood he had to be born into the family you couldn't put in a job application you have to be born a levite you have to be born in the line of iran to be considered for a high priest and by the branham city believers though this every priest that was in the lineage of the priesthood knowed as soon as he stepped in behind into the priesthood listen he had a right to taste a bite of the original manna that fell in the beginning so not only was there a sacredness and a consecration to being a priest but there were blessings and privileges of being a priest there are certain things you had access to he could have a bite as soon as he was ordained in the priesthood he could taste the original manna how beautiful that is of the holy spirit our sustaining strength to carry the church on if they fail to eat the manna they died and if we fail to eat on the holy ghost we die if we fail to pray through daily all the time and keep under the blood you'll wither up and die in your christian experience can the church say man oh this is not a kind of jump for joy kind of message but we are dealing with going to the golden altar we are dealing with getting right with god we are dealing with coming back to calvary coming back to the cross we're dealing with not having all 10 grudges and leaving your burdens and leaving your cares behind you and living a life holy holy holy holy holy holy that's what a saint is the sanctified ones you are called to be sanctified you are called to receive the holy ghost you are called to be adopted you are called for a super church a perfect church but i brought him to the church that sin cannot stay in that church blessed be the name of the lord and god instituted it in that mosaic covenant for that ironic priesthood or levitical priesthood the office of the high priest so that the people would have someone to offer sacrifices on their behalf and represent them in the presence of god that old covenant provided a sacrificial system in which the blood of bulls and goats at least temporarily enabled them to remain in fellowship with god the old covenant under moses was filled with grace and mercy long suffering and love they would just wait patiently when the high priest would go in to offer the sacrifice once a year they would just wait and wait and wait to see if god accepted the sacrifice and we know that god that that that they would tie up rope around them so that if they don't hear the sound coming out they could pull the body out from inside of there because no man could go in there who wasn't qualified to go in there anybody with me this morning you couldn't just walk into there you couldn't just see well i'm a israelite oh i'm a levite it wasn't good enough you had to meet the requirements till we go into the holy of holies isn't that right can the church say amen but that whole system was a flawed system it was a temporary system you catch them our shameless brother over i said could you imagine that god knew that this system would be temporary but god didn't just have it anyhow even though it was temporary he still established how to do the tabernacle he still established how to do the clothes he still established the way they were going to do it and he knew that they were only doing it until he came come on somebody preached back to me and god didn't just let anything pass even though the time was not there yet for him to do the work as a great high priest he said i still want you to live right i still want you to approach it sacred i still want you to come to god the right way god knew all along what was going to happen but he still took time i want you to catch his friends how god operates so different from us he was building a temporary system and god spent chapter after chapter by the pop well get blue and get this color and get this stone and put it this way and get the gold and god knew that when jesus comes on the earth that whole system would be ripped off and finished he would throw away that system but god didn't say let us do it any old hole come the church anyhow you want no it had to be done a certain way because god is holy his way is holy his tabernacle is holy oh hallelujah and the approach to god must be holy hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah we knew it was a substitute we knew it was temporary but god doesn't matter he is a perfect god he wants perfect worship he wants a perfect sacrifice he wants a perfect life god designed it to be temporary think about it friends god knew it was going to be temporary those two and eventually they didn't understand it then you know because they were just living their lives taking it i said come god says something that they don't understand they just leave it there they'll believe it they'll accept it or they'll leave it there and they they don't jesus come and say the spirit of the lord is upon me that was there all along but nobody knew what to do with it it was there all along it was written all along but nobody knew what it meant the spirit of the lord is upon me for he had anointed me and i could imagine since the days that were spoken and written others may have read it and said this is an inspiring quote it's an inspiring scripture there's got to be something to this we don't know what it is but one day we may know what it is anybody with me this morning but it had to be there because jesus had to be captured under there but when jesus came that's why when he was reading it brother pop well there was no opposition to it there was no question to it the spirit of the lord is upon me for he had anointed me to and bring the titles and and and all this stuff but when jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled that is what caught the attention of the church because never before had anybody finished that scripture with that statement this was the first time that that scripture was being made present tense oh hallelujah it was laying in the message all along all along it was there all along it was there in the scrolls all along it was there in the book all along it was there but nobody knew what to do with it no wonder the prophet said rapturing fate is laying in this message the secret to leaving this place is laying into this message the secret to getting back to eden is laying in this message one day the right word will be spoken one day somebody will pick up from the prophet's message something [Music] laying there all along laying there all along the is laying there all along from the moment you were born that seed in you was there all along you didn't knew what it was you didn't understand what it was but there came a time there became a day there came an hour there came a minute when what was there all along suddenly spark suddenly come alive and a change took place in your life a change took place in your walk a change took place in your understanding a change took place in your awareness you didn't realize that you're a child of the king you didn't realize who your father is you didn't realize that you're a king you didn't know you were a priest but you can't be a king or you can't be a priest unless there's a seed in you of being a king of being a priest you can't respond to this message if there's no seed of a king in your soul you can't respond to this message if there's no seed of being a priest in your soul this is not for the church member this is not to the message believer this is for the sons of god who understand who they are understand where they come from come on now somebody help me this morning this is not for everybody this is not for the church this is not just for a believer this is for the seeds of god the royal seeds the true seed of abraham hallelujah give the lord a shout our praise give the lord some worship give the lord some worship you may be seated so god in his plan god in his mind god and understanding that the question that adam had in his heart because adam had tasted power he had tasted glory he had tasted dominion he had tasted kingship he had tasted all these things and when adam was kicked out of eden god had to have a way back he had to have a way to get adam back so god is unfolding his plan and he's unfolding it as he wants to unfold it he's unfolding it the way he sees to unfold it [Music] and as each age passes he is revealing pieces of himself because it all has to make sense it'll be only at a certain time that somebody will put it together but it has to be done a certain way because if there's no precedent for it then god can't unveil it can the church say man so hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and to show the progression of revelation paul the apostle paul he wrote to the corinthians and he would write to the corinthians the issues are dealing with the corinthians he would write to the philippians he issued a deal with the philippians he would write to the ephesians the issue delivered the ephesians the vast majority of what poor bring would be to the gentiles but there are certain things he addressed to the jews as well in his letter to the hebrews he is speaking to the hebrews anybody with me and he has to use with them language they would understand he would have to share things with them things they should know things they would have been taught if there's one thing that was known in those days was the scriptures they may not have known what it meant but they knew about it because they challenged you our fathers told us this he said and are they all dead the new scripture but they didn't really understand so paul in hebrews 4 verse 14 understand he is speaking to hebrews and he's saying to them because the fact that he has to see it means that their understanding of what this is is not clear so as an apostle as a messenger as an anointed one he is bringing clarity to their spiritual experience to their journey and how they're living so that they can grow into maturity isn't that what the gospel is for to bring us to maturity to sharpen up our weak areas to help us see clara in the world what applies to us so we could be prepared to leave this place it's not just a half church and we have a good time but we come here to see what we need to work on so paul is right into each age this is what you need to work on we dealt with the corinthians in bible study each age god each each group each group each church paul d william but listen to his message to the hebrews seeing then hebrews 4 verse 14 that we have a great high priest he can't talk this high priest talk with the gentiles like that because they don't understand how priests do a jew would understand high priest seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not on high priest so he's making now a comparison to the high priest that they are used to for we have not and high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities he said this high piece of document is different it is not that he can be touched but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin so he's beginning to make a distinction between this high priest is talking about and the high priest that they used to from aaron on down to the high priest that they know for all of their generations and every high priest will come after the lion i hear on all down to caiaphas and these fellas anybody with me this morning let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need and then we go into hebrews 5 and this is relevant to us friends because god told moses that you will be a kingdom of priests and the way god told moses that moses expressed it this was said only to the children of israel so you and i could have no part in that priestly kingdom unless a way is made for us to access that priestly kingdom and unless you were born in the tribe of levites and unless you are of the sons of of of of aaron you can't just be a priest not even somebody from another tribe could be a priest if you weren't born the right place but god had to find a way to pick you and me to be part of this kingdom of priests anybody with me this morning you know where i'm going hebrews 5 1 for every priest taken from among men is ordained for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins so paul is explaining what they know already he said who can have compassion on the ignorant he's describing the attributes of a priest and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity so he seen a priest would have some level of compassion because the priests himself have his own challenges anybody with me and by reason here of he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer sins to offer for sins so he's saying the priests that you're used to they can't just even offer for you they have to offer for their sins first before they give him an offer for you so he's beginning to point out now clearly the issues with the aaronic priesthood or the levitical priesthood or the priesthood that they used to can the church say amen and no man taking this honor unto himself so so you can't make yourself a priest you can't say i'm feeling led i'm feeling priestess i wake up this morning and i feel the call to be a priest you couldn't be born in the tribe of god or naftali or whatever it all and say i feel to be a priest today i'm looking at elephant dealer physical priest and i really admire how they move and and i feel i have something you couldn't do that so paul is making clear no man taking this honor unto himself but that he is called of god as was aaron so paul is laying on clearly it was true aaron this order was called you can't vote yourself you can't nominate yourself somebody can't see that brother living right i think he's supposed to be a priest you can fast on a mountain for how much days you want unless you were called by god keep fasting but this priesthood wasn't for you anybody with me it was not by works it was my appointment it was not by resume it was my predestination [Applause] it was not by works it was by being called can the church say amen so paul is bringing clarity to people who should know these things they're aware of the scriptures they know the history but he's not showing them i know what you're used to but let me show you why this jesus is different verse 5 so also christ listen to this now glorified not himself to be made an high priest hallelujah he didn't choose this high priest so he said jesus didn't even choose his high priest but he said he that said unto him down at my son today have i begotten thee as he saith also in another place so paul is now quoting dull at a priest forever after the order of melchizedek hallelujah and in there paul slips in the credentials the access under which jesus could be called a priest can the church say amen who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death was heard in that he had feared though he will a son yet learn he obedient by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek now why is this important for those younger ones around us to find out about melchizedek you have to go back into genesis now the fact that paul is bringing this clarity it is not that they didn't know about mercy they just did not fit into the plan anybody with me because abraham would have had an encounter in genesis 14 verse 17 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chadolama so abraham had just come back victorious from a slaughter and of the kings that were with him at the valley of chevy which is the king's deal and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tight of all so abraham paid tights to melchizedek the fact that melchizedek blessed abraham according to ancient tradition and biblical and ancient practice meant that abraham realized that of the two of them mel kenny that had greater stature fathers were typically blessed sons seniors would bless juniors and there was just a mystery hanging there israel knew about it they didn't know what it meant they just knew abraham at this experience can the church say man abraham recognized melchizedek as his priest because he paid tithes to him so the jews that paul speaking to they would be aware of this now he's bringing it into the narrative now notice in scripture the only time melchizedek is mentioned within the old testament is this interaction with abraham and then in islam of david so in psalms 110 the bible says and the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool psalms 110 verse one the lord capital l o r d said unto my lord sit down at my right hand until so there's a time limit i make that enemies thy footstool the lord said unto my lord so this is now god himself speaking unto my lord which is david's lord which is david's seed david's descendants so david is really relating a conversation between god and jesus my lord turn into my lord sit down at my right hand didn't when jesus raised me that go on your right hand sitting at the right hand is priestly office until for a period of time i make them enemies thy footstool that's the kingly office your enemy is your footstool verse 2 the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion ruled out in the midst of thine enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou has due of thy ute the lord had sworn and will not repent listen this repent is not an apology this repentance can't take it back throw out a priest forever after the order of melchizedek can the church say amen so this is hanging there but nobody is connecting the dots and here it is paul in hebrews 7 begins to now write in his letter for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him so paul is now beginning to preach this thing are you with me this morning we're speaking about three priesthoods the aaronic priesthood the melchizedek priesthood and the royal priesthood for this melchizedek king of salem priests of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all he paid his tie to him first being by interpretation king of righteousness so he's given the names of this melchizedek he is by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but being made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch gave the tent of the spoils this year is loadable power because abram is the father of nations so if abraham is a father of nations and jesus himself is called a son of abraham who would it be that abraham would have to pay attention to can the church say amen now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch so he's like singing in a shocking statement even abraham abraham himself gave the tent of his spoils and go on and verily listen they that are of the sons of levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham so he's saying this melchizedek who wasn't counted of the descendants but still received heights so that means you have to be bigger than the tribe believer you have to be bigger than the priesthood of iran anybody with freedom this morning and bless him that had the promises so if he's blessing abraham if he's receiving tithes from abraham oh hallelujah verse seven and with all contradiction listen the less is blessed of the better so it means that this melchizedek has to be really special to be blessed in abraham because if alta abraham came iran an altar abraham can be tribal levites and out of this thing who could it be that this melchizedek is to be blessing abraham in the first place [Music] and listen verse 8 and here men that die receive tithes but there he received them of whom it has witnessed that he live it and as i may say so levi listen so paul is now going deeper and they say even levi also who receive tights also pay tight in abraham so who would levi who is the priest and the line of the priests pay ties to it has to be an even higher priest can the church say amen for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him i know you know this but let's let's make sure we get it right if therefore perfection will by the levitical priesthood for under it the people receive the law what further need was there that another piece should rise after the order of melchizedek's and not be called after the order of iran for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law so he's saying this pre-setting that you know all these years has come to an end because of this jesus who was called of the order of melchizedek he come from a different tribe altogether can the church say amen listen verse 13 for he of whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar so in other words pauline explained to them you know the law you know they command only those of a tribal levite of the levites could be a priest but just jesus was not from that tribe so what tribe is he from if he is a priest and not just a priest because even among the levites only the sons of iran could be high priests so where did jesus come from where is his pedigree where is his heritage for him to be a high priest like this high priest verse 14. so paul makes it clear for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood can the church say amen so it means that jesus is coming from a whole different level now can can the church say amen and yet far more evidence for that after the cemetery of melchizedek there arises another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testified thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek for there is verily a disannuling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god for in as much as not without an oat he was made priests for those priests were made without an old but this with an oat by him that sent unto him the lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek by so much was jesus made authority of a better testament and they truly were many priests because they will not suffer to continue by reason of death but this man because he continued ever had an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also listen to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever live it to make intercession for them so paul is preaching now he really preached it he said those priests you know before would die and the next people come and they can only intercede for you once or twice or whatever it is but this priest because he don't die because he cannot die because he lives forever could make intercession for such and high priests became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice for his for his own sins and then for the people for this he did once when he offered for himself for the law make it men high priests which have infirmity but the word of oat which was since the lord make it a son who is consecrated forevermore can the church say amen everybody feeling fine so this melchizedek of which jesus was of the order of melchizedek this pre this priest that abraham met this high priest was none other than the lord jesus christ himself who came to set a precedent before he established the aaronic priesthood so that when he choose to come in the time he came nobody could say you're not from the tribal iran you're not from the tribal levite no he could say i'm from the order of melchizedek before abraham was i was before iran was i was before levi was i was before the priesthood was i was and whereas the priesthood you knew before had to be done a certain way because of what i did and because of who i am and because of the order of melchizedek i can now open the door for other people to be priests you don't need to be at a tribe and leave like no more to be a priest you don't need to be of the child of the sons of iran anymore to be a priest can the church say amen i'm not going to be too much longer with you hallelujah hallelujah mr brown said who is this bunch of melchizedek you know this and notice melchizedek did not offer any money he only offered bread and wine mercury was a priest of the most high the king of jerusalem it was then called salem oh my i can prove it jerusalem was for salem jerusalem it was first called jerusalem that's right which when it was in gentile possession and the king of jerusalem or salem which was meaning the king of peace the king of righteousness met abraham as he returned and he gave him communion bread and wine thousands of years or 100 years before bread and wine was an ordinance showing it was the lord jesus christ it was the same god changing mast it was the same god changing scenes in god's mind it's a whole place a whole drama of how we gonna destroy the enemy and raise up a kingdom of priests before they understood what was happening he was already doing his part to make a way possible for kings and priests in this day to be called [Applause] based on the order of melchizedek who was this great man with a random can the church him he was not only a king but he was a priest so melchizedek was a king priest he was a king priest so it's not an uncomfortable statement to say that we will be king priests hallelujah because melchizedek was a king priest hallelujah and we know it through the old testament the lines of the kings were separated from the lines of the priests the priests were only from the tribe of levite but you are different king kings of judah kings of this kingdom but when jesus come he was another king priest just like oh come on now and because he was a king priest he can now unlock the door for more king priests oh he can now unlock the door for a chosen generation a peculiar people a royal priesthood because he was the example [Applause] [Music] to our people who were never people before when moses was speaking to them they thought they were the only ones who were under the covenant of the kingdom of priests but because of jesus now those who were never a people who were not of this tribe and that tribe could now be our people and get the same access because he tear the veil from top to bottom abolish your priesthood abolish that mosaic priesthood abolish the aaronic priesthood can the church say amen anybody with me you may be seated the great high priest brother terrence so there in genesis he was the first priest isn't that right oh but kevin was the first priest and when jesus came he became the last priest because when he came there was no need for any other high priest because his priesthood was established forever so this priest we're talking about this great high priest is the first and he is the last hallelujah he established the beginning he established the ending that ironic prison was a temporary priesthood between the scriptural context of that first great high priest and jesus coming as the great high priest and when jesus came there was no more need for any high priest to ever have to get a sacrifice to go before the people because by his great sacrifice he abolished forever the system of man the system of the priesthood the failures of the priests [Applause] he may be seated so there is no office of high priests that had to be filled again iran's son became a high priest then his son after him became a high priest and he'll all be looking to who is the next high priest who is the next high priest so that when jesus came it had a high priest there and that high priest who was there but he cliff didn't realize that his job was finishing him you know when he said somebody come to take your work he didn't realize that when jesus was born in a manger all them priests who were servant who was eligible to be our next high priest are their work finish no work for you no no no atonement allele anymore if you're doing it it's just a ritual because the great high priests perform forever forever one time forever there was a time limit brother currents on iran as high priests there was a time limit on his son eliasa as high priest there was a time limit on phineas as a high priest but when jesus stepped into his role as high priest there is no time limit because he's a priest forever you may be seated iran led a certain category of priests these priests had to also die these priests had to do certain things but this jesus this great high priest is about to lead a kingdom of priests who also they will not die come on now this kind of priest we're talking about have a rapture promise this kind of oh you don't hear me you don't hear me never was there order of priesthood like this order of priests hallelujah hallelujah but it said listen i want you to catch it friends it was there in the world all along you know but paul is bringing clarity to them i know you've heard it before i know you ready before but let me put it together for you that's what paul was doing he said i know you're here but are you here but melchizedek you hear about it but let me tell you how jesus comes because only i have questions the fact that paul have to raise it mean they're wondering how could he be a high priest he's not from which i believe right that would have been a natural question how could paul preach that he is a high priest we know too well that you have to be of this i believe i to be a high priest you have to be able to descendants of aaron to be a high priest and paul preaching that jesus is a high priest not just any kind of high priest but this one you could touch him he feel what you feel he knows what you're going through this high priest don't have to offer for his issues and then your issues but with one offering he covered you and i he covered it forever and he make an intercession at the right hand of god this is not any kind of priest talking about god deliberately had it that he is not on the tribal levite unless you say he was of the ironic order but i had to have him outside of that order outside of the tribe to prove he is different whoa and god had to find you outside of the expectation of the world your family don't even know who you are god found you out of season out of order in a different place and god called you to a royal priesthood royal priesthood royal priesthood you're looking at royalty this morning you're looking at the priest this morning can the church say man hallelujah having no mother having no father but was made like unto the son of god abided a priest continually had no beginning he has no ending had no father had no mother yet he was a man he came from sailor reading the prophet he was the king of peace he was the king of righteousness he was not only a king but he was a prince he is a prince of peace he is a rose of sharon he is a lily of the valley he the morning star the alpha the omega he that was which is and shall come both root and offspring of david he was before david in david and after david i'm reading from the prophet who was this priest none other than the incarnated lord jesus christ in his magnificent power he was the same one a little later on after he had met abraham listen and gave him as being a covenant people the communion then now through the same covenant he was in a shadow that melchizedek when he become a man of flesh would be cut into pot and the communion will be given the fragrance of his broken body as we take today dear that melchizedek met abraham and abraham paid tithe to him abraham abraham the greatest man on the face of the earth paid tied to melchizedek the king of peace the king of salem the king of righteousness he was a prince but abandonment is repeating himself it's too good you have to keep do you know who we're talking about this morning whoo he was a prince he was a king and he was a servant of the most high which jesus was oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother branham said and when abraham a few years later or not too long after that when a lot had backslid listen to how the prophet put it now and sodom had been built okay and abram was left alone with syrah on the barren grounds and the cattle was all dying from starvation and it looked like god had failed him but he had a strong faith to believe and one day he was sitting at the door of his tent under the big oak it still stands in a memorial today as it's chad over and held and dear abraham sitting in the door of his tent scene listen melchizedek coming to him three men walking but ibrahim said i could just imagine abraham saying i've seen him before so parabanum is showing that abram is recognizing this man hallelujah it was the same god he changed form changed basque it's as if in a play by the pop well and you know who the character is you know and no matter what clause you put on hallelujah in the play you still know it's you you there you are the actor and you change your costume you're putting a different jacket a different tie a different shoes and i said but it's still popular he's acting in a different part but he's still the same pop well and then you're going on this scene and they come back again you win a different outfit now but he calling himself frank now but that's the same one and they're going over his scene and they come back again and i say but wait no he call himself tony nobody's the same one at the same way god has been slipping in and out in and out in and out he was before david he slipped into david he was after david he was before elijah slipped into elijah was after elijah he was before moses slipped into moses was after moses he was before joshua slipped into joshua and left a hallelujah and in this end time pride he was before you he will be in you but he will never leave you because he will be dwelling in a people can the church say amen [Music] [Applause] superior ibrahim said again no in that same quote he said but when melchizedek the king of salem the priest of the most high the king of peace you see that connection between priests king priest king priest king so this is why the whole royal priesthood thing and kings and priests that you see in john say in the book of revelation is so important because it's a prophecy all the way back in genesis when we're back in exodus exodus 19 god talking about that thing a long time this is not a new message today you know oh come on now since exodus 19 is over the kingdom of priests and that message has been unchanged that message by the eclipse has been unchanged kingdom of priests kingdom of priests priests kings kings and priests so by time peter come he said he sings him you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a peculiar people he cannot preach it because he knows a royal priesthood hallelujah he cannot preach it and we read in scripture anybody with me to see how it ties into our message as i get ready to close out in a few musicians get ready we read it there in revelation revelation 5 and i saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so so what was being locked up in this thing and unfolded into this thing and this whole seals and mystery thing and i saw a strong ancient brook came with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing it what was this this was the key for the heathcliff to unlock in the kings and priests if this book didn't open there are no kings and priests oh come on now and no man in heaven nor in it neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look to run and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book needed to look there on and one of the elders said unto me listen weep not behold the lion king of the tribe of judah the root of david who we talking about oh hallelujah had prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof and behold and low in the midst of the throne and of the four peace and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into holy earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne what could you imagine the jubilation the excitement oh hallelujah john was weeping because he was concerned about the king's priesthood coming back into power listen and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty ella's fell down before the lamb having each one of them hops and golden vials of orders which are the prayers of the saints and they change their song i don't know what song they were singing before but they changed a song but they sang a new song and this is the song that they started to sing oh hallelujah the word worthy to take the book and to open the seas thereof for god was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood listen out of every kindred not just israel only not just abraham natural seed only but out of every kindred and tongue and people and nations and the song didn't end there but occurrence this is the old song it's a semicolon there so the song was continuing and has made us unto our god kings and priests kings and priests kings and priests so because this book was taken this book being taken this book oh come on now made it possible so for kings and priests and listen how does it end and we shall reign on the youth that rain on the earth means back to eden come on now that is back to eden by the altar true the altar you have to be a priest you have to be your king you have to be a priest you have to be a king royal priesthood royal priesthood lawyer priesthood royal priesthood i'm going to close out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah listen and lean not unto my own understanding but ibraham said now the bible said the new testament he is the high priest right now so so so we are kings but the title king of kings is for a king who is above other kings so we are kings who are held account by the king of kings and we are priests who are held to account by the great high priests not iran not any other priest but the lord jesus christ himself the great high priest hallelujah after the order of mckenzie are you with me listen he is the high priest right now he continues the high priest after the order of mercedes he is the high priest forever so his role nobody else could sit there there's no vacancy for the position there's no other head of this body about christ there's no other high priest but the lord jesus christ himself and listen because we are priests there's nobody between us i'm getting to god because as a priest it gives you access that's why all the veil being rent was so important because it means in the old days you had to go to the priest to offer sacrifice but now you are priests you could offer your sacrifice today you could offer your sacrifice this morning you could all come on now anybody with me this morning listen he is the high priest forever there is no i'm listening i'm reading from the prophet there's no other high priest but him listen i'm talking about kings and priests are they talking about church i talk about ministry i'm talking about priests high priest relationship i'm talking about king king of king's relationship oh hallelujah because reigning on the earth is king and king of king relationship his son and father thing is priests and high priesting listen jewish about to be over you know and i'm talking about and the knowledge of our kingship and the knowledge of our royalty and our knowledge of the red carpet and the streets of gold oh come on now and the angels assigned to take command for us i'm trying to close out now the bible says he is a high priest right now without the weight no right now he's here please he continues the high priest after the order of melchizedek he is a high priest forever there's no other high priest but him no other mediator between god and men but the man christ so he's not the pastor is not an evangelist not an apostle there's no prophet there's nothing between you and christ every other office is subject to that relationship and to push for the relationship between you and your father between you and your king between you and your high priests who was between adam and god god would come down in the cool of the evening to have communion melchizedek met abraham and had communion the lord jesus met his disciples when they thanked him he had communion we do all this as a type as an ordinance now because one day we'll sit with him and have communion it'll be me and him him and i or in that secret place oh hallelujah nothing to get between sin can get between there your neighbor can get between there your past can get between there because once you accept your priesthood you leave your life behind you put it under the blood jesus paid it all and his one sacrifice his one offering has sanctified you forever i'm almost done no other mediator between god and men but the man christ that's right he is the only one and he is the same yesterday today and forever brother branham goes on now if he remains that same high priest and the bible said we can touch him by the feelings of our infirmities like that little woman did that touch his garment your faith can touch him tonight and he'll act the same way in human flesh like he did when he was in human flesh there abraham's oak do you believe this hallelujah my last quote in the seven church eighties but abraham said spiritual priesthood royal nation spiritual offering what is it now spiritual sacrifices that is quoting the scripture that is the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name now what kind of a what he said a spiritual sacrifice now now we might as well get started right here notice a good place to start from listen to the prophet now um do we have priests in the house today do you understand your priesthood and your kingship can i speak to the priests a message from the high priest because the high priest sent a message to the priest through the prophet he said when a little confusion comes in the church you don't run over to one side and out now if you are you sure in the priest you see how the prophet addressed the priest now he said when a little confusion comes into the church you don't run over to one side and pout now if you are you show in the priest see you pray through because that's what priests do you say your prayer life begin to change spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name you see what i mean well you say i just don't feel like going to church he said but you're a priest hallelujah listen listen we're speaking to priests we have i asked a question you know and most of you put up your hand you say well you say i just don't feel like going to church he said but you're a priest it's your duty you've got to be there what kind of peace are you it is your turn to to to trim the wick and it's your turn to do the evening sacrifices but abraham goes on well i just i just don't feel like taking a part in the service he said you're a priest making a sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice not giving somebody some hand me down as they call it today that's all good i have nothing against it not going to get somebody to come to you that's all good i have nothing against it but it's you you making the spiritual sacrifice the fruits of your lips giving praise to his name so you can be a priest and sit down silent in church because the fruits of your lips as a priest you can't help but give praise to god you can't help but say lord you're worthy holy holy holy is the lord lord i give a sacrifice of praise even when you don't feel like worshiping as a priest you go against your feeling you show up even when you don't feel like it you do your duty when you don't feel like it because you're a priest you'll accept your priesthood [Music] when you see a time coming that everybody blaspheming and seeing these things and doing things wrong what do you do walk away you're supposed to stand there with a spiritual sacrifice saying the blood of jesus christ cleanses from all sin makes me a new creature in christ jesus you're a crazy fellow according to what you say it's all right but to me it's the power of god unto salvation i believe it now they say you believe in divine healing oh i don't know you but i asked well pastor what do you think about it you're the priest now but if i say you are the priest now if you're the priest you're supposed to know not we don't i don't know if you believe in divine healing let me go and ask the pastor if we believe in divine healing i don't know if we're looking for a revival am i asking pastor what about revival you're the priest now you're supposed to know he's without a revival you're supposed to be creating a revival because you're a priest yes sir i believe it because god would say so if you believe in the baptism of the holy spirit how do you know i've received a showing of a spiritual blessing first peter 2 5 he also has lively stones have built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ closing out here you are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a kingdom of priests because jesus is the great priest king just like melchizedek as the office of the great priest king the lion and the lamb won the victory as king because he gave himself as a final sacrifice for king over to redeem us even now he reigns as king of kings lord of lords and as high priest he intercedes for us oh and as a redeemed people of god just like the aaronic priesthood we are set aside from all other people like iran's comment was to set them aside we are peculiar people have to now walk in this
