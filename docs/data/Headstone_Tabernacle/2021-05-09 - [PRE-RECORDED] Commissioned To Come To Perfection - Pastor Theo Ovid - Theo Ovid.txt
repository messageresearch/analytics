will speak on our behalf this morning look over your needy children where the needy's people in the face of the earth have your way in jesus might ask it amen and amen and amen go praise god god bless you i want to thank you for your birthday greetings god's gifts god bless you amen before you take your seats we want to go straight to the word matthew 5 48 ephesians 4 11-13 on first peter 4 12-14 it's great to be here i heard about a great time in that dealing with youth issues yesterday praise the name of the lord for all who are here know it was a tremendous blessing and i'm so happy to hear that report so we want to go into scriptures matthew 5 48 ephesians 4 11 and 1st peter 4 12 to 14. marty 5 48 one verse be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect ephesians 4 reading from verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets on some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the fate and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and from first peter chapter four i want to read from verse 12 it reads beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as do some strange thing happen unto you but rejoice in as much as your partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happier ye for the spirit of glory and of god rested upon you on their part he's evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified let's pray father we thank you for your holy word and i pray that you would take your spirit and make more sense of it today to every heart guarded here bring it in its simplicity of revelation and power that each person would leave here edified built up strengthened inspired i wanted to love you and be draw closer to you bless each one got it here bless those that will be listening on the internet bless the whole internet community that will be connected to us this morning in a special remedy anointing sweep into their homes into their hearts into their lives and wherever this tape be played and jesus may ask it amen and amen you may be seated god bless you again it's a great privilege an honor for me to be here but i have something upon my heart that i believe is extremely important for the church today and i believe that that service they that wait upon the lord we want to continue not the exact line but continue along that vein because the prophet said perfection is patience written on god and waiting for god that is the process of character development so this morning i have a title commissioned to come to perfection commissioned to come to perfection and have a subject place of trying i have an inspiration let us go on to perfection the subject place of trying i will brackets around that the process of character development to continue that's what this place of trying is all about now the word commission is the act of granting certain powers or the authority to carry out a particular task or duty or document conferring such authorization or power thus granted so when jesus said be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect it's a commission to perfection he is saying you tier four this amplified must be perfect and going deeper growing into complete maturity of godliness in mind and character having reached the proper height of virtue and integrity as your heavenly father is perfect so when we're talking about perfect we're talking about getting to the channel of really being mature understanding being thoroughly admonished and taught mature in handling your issues in handling your trials that you wouldn't count it strange what is happening to you because you will understand that your trial of your faith is where patients get opportunity to work and patients must have its perfect work that you may be entire lacking nothing and in that trial and struggle is where character is developed and where you come to maturity like your father he was perfect or is mature having the wisdom and understanding to deal with the issues as they come your way so it wouldn't be be no more children tossed to and fro blaming this one blaming that one making excuses but you will accept responsibility for your actions and your attitude knowing that god expect that of you as mature sons and daughters this is the service to put away the bibs and the baby stuff there's the service to put away the pacifiers and the thing you want to suck on this is that kind of service this is a service to wreck the church members and get the bride out feeling to be like bride to be mrs jesus christ this is that kind of service let us go on to perfection forget about church could somebody say amen let the church say amen hallelujah this is that kind of service to go on to move on to press on there's a goal that somebody want to achieve you're accustomed just come in the church and go back home i challenge you this morning to go beyond that let's go on to perfection let's give the lord a shout out free [Music] hallelujah just let me drop this before i start but branham and what is the holy ghost said what is the holy ghost what is it now the reason i've taken this subject in line like this here we go you cannot receive the holy spirit therefore you can't be it if you have to receive it what we're talking about you're receiving it you cannot receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you then you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know the results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is to and what action it brings when it comes then you will know what you got when you get it come because the lord i shout our praise oh we are in the work today oh hallelujah so last week message titled wait upon the lord subject waiting on god waiting for god the process of character development inspiration cutting you down to the word only there are some people shaped the church only there are some people change the denomination only to message only but this is cut you down to the word only when you get cut your emotions get cut your feelings get cut what you think we supposed to do that all got get cut your own thoughts get cut all must remain is the word man shall live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of god oh hallelujah glory hakka says sorry i'm not so sorry that you are in this age hallelujah if you're feeling a little whole then you may be in the wrong age maybe you're in some time capsule that you get followed where you're not we're not supposed to be you were supposed to be back and looter ate somewhere but god desired that this age is too tough to just that ordinary folks are born in this age and graces this is the roughest they just were satan loose and people get so desensitized to the power of the enemy that they don't even recognize that hell has been uncovered the lid of hell and streams of demon powers have been loosed on the earth they don't understand that the field church is protected family protected everybody protected arm under the blood harmony the blood development okay that's good that's a song but the reality is this a war is going on a war that starts in heaven that continue on this earth oh glory to god and amidst your trial and test he promised come on say he promised he promised all things to work together for good come on oh get the lord he didn't stop there to them to them that love god to them who are the called according not to your purpose according to his purpose there's a health purpose for your life could you give him a shout could you give god a praise there is a his purpose not your husband purpose not your wife purpose not your family purpose not even your purpose there's his purpose for your life amen and we were speaking you can never get to the quote about cutting onto the word but we speak about michelangelo's statue of moses being cut out of stone from a vision he had in his mind he had in his mind and his heart and his spirit nobody has had it because he had a vision isn't that right what's his vision isn't that right and you see him hitting that rock knocking out things knocking out things and somebody who don't have the same vision they don't know what that man is doing they could criticize that man laugh at that man mocker that man but that man is who have the vision and he is knocking out things knocking out here knocking on here he is knocking out everything that is not moses come on no man somebody in other words there's a big old rock but moses insider there and there's a big all you but christ our image is inside a tear and god gonna do some knocking some cutting some hone in oh give the lord a shelter praise it's not gonna be you and you are more you you're gonna go and he gonna come he's gonna be revealed in you by you through you oh glory to god amen so the burden many ideas of labor how we are to hold that same vision all the time in his mind and that's where people get wary and the bible says have you not heard the lord don't get wary they get tired when you have a vision oh man it said come here it's from the point of time people want to send you here send you here go here go here but the vision is fixed god don't have a vision and say you know what i change my mind i change my mind what kind of god is that if he's changing his mind god does not change his mind because he is perfect his first vision is perfect is if we can escape with the vision you see no one had a vision it was going to rain god didn't tell him next week it was 120 years and god didn't tell him 120 years he had to keep on preaching it's gonna rain god said so i know only cutting down trees the ark is not built yet how god can say reign in the action built yet but no one to preach while the revelation is unfolding god said cut down this kind of tree and he's preaching as he's cut long tree it's gonna it's going to rain it's gonna yeah it's going to rain okay he put the first level you put the foundation on the boat it's still going to rain hallelujah water to wait for the vision to be completed come on come on now the fullness of time came to the fullness of the word to produce the fullness of the body isn't that right when the ark is complete now the message more anointed because the ark is ready i don't know when i don't know how because we never fell on the earth yet but i know if god said it he is big enough to make it come to pass oh give the lord some praises people are you with me now oh hallelujah then moses noah started to get fresh revelation present tense inspiration so no one started appreciate that desperation come on people come on young people come into the act they don't want to hear the gospel god say you know what preach to the animals my act will be filled my table is going to be filled go to the highways and the privates and and preach the women those that wherever they are preach to them because my tale is going to be filled the animals started coming two by two everybody's supposed to know something had to be taken place those animals not crazy praise god come on now if the other but crazy those animals wasn't crazy they was heading to one place straight to the ark because they heard the call somebody has been built to hear a call somebody gonna get a call today that call is built in if the animals could get a call of god to go into act by nature what about the holy ghost what about the kingdom of god what about the rapture what about the coming of the lord there's got to be a call there's got to be a deep calling to a deep oh glory to god you've got to be a call of god god want to awaken that call in your spirit god wants to awaken that call in your soul do you believe that so he said michelangelo stayed right with the vision until it was completed and when it was completed it was so inspiring to him what he had in his heart what he had in his mind so real he's tracking them all speak it was so real and the prophet went on to say about jesus come and so so perfect in the image of god god said speak and listen to this word he said now lord make me moan me make me lord what i should be and there'll be a different thing he said if i've been lifted from the earth i'll draw all men unto me yes sir this is the court now he is cutting you down now he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you and trying to get a bride for his son here we go another masterpiece part of the word so this bright egg will be just be bride and church no she is going to be here we go another masterpiece peace of the master another masterpiece just like him are you with me oh praise god so god and in this age but ram's in obedience this little faith woman lived by faith the bride isn't that right waiting in her love obedient for the waiting in love here what for for the promise of the age to be confirmed waiting not grumpy written not bad spirited waiting not angry waiting not miserable and cranky squatting inside of your number one you're quiet and saying another one you gotta be waiting in a certain way waiting in love what kind of love oh i'm not feeling good [Music] what kind of love elective love that different from the feeling we fill your love silly philippi we're talking about elective agapo love you see god love is not like human love god love is elective love he could stand with his love send you to the fiery furnace send you to the lion's den senor and get some some cool breeze in egypt but it still is love isn't that right and how do we how do we show we love god by conducting ourselves with joy amidst come on the trials he and his wisdom send our way i see the smile starting to come now [Applause] like you're getting a fight to connect with joy that's why peter said counter not strange you have to conduct yourself with joy and always let the devil know you don't have one on me come on now you almost got me you used to catch me but i'm getting mature i'm coming to perfection i am going into perfection everything is trying to shake you out of the atmosphere come on a lot of issues and churches have nothing to do with mainly with the word itself i said the whole funny business natural business all kind of ordinary business that's called all kind of issues and problems and they'll find that and fight fault as if we signed up for all of that but we did because all of that goes with the hallelujah demons go with the package sickness go with the packers prison go with the package big stone go with the package ship wreck over the package here go with the package mean people go with the package heavy high-minded over the package church members go with the package traders heavy high-minded lovers don't let go of the pension people want to cut your dog that go in the park people jealous you that go with the package people hate you that go with the package people are enemy of you backed over the package do you want the package it all come together that goes with the package oh give the lord some praises people but you know what else go with the packet revival go with the package holy ghost go with the package power go with the package these signs shall follow them that believe go with the package the same ones i do also go with the package also oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory that's why the bible says when you are reproached the spirit of glory rested upon you oh god when everybody love you love you love you no glory resting upon you even the devil are always loving you oh sit down man oh hallelujah hallelujah so when he made man in his own image he reflected him god spoke through the image of man showing what he will do the perfect image god and murphy had changed here we go from supernatural division and the vision was projected like have a projector division was projected into an image and the image was smitten so the supernatural could taste the feeling of debt god's perfect masterpiece then he started another pentecost to build another masterpiece original seed word started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifested the promise that has been given and then he gave the scripture joel said have a scripture assigned to these things you know if that come to pass i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy old men shall dream dreams young men shall see visions amen there's none right notice it started out as original the word is a seed a sour soul watch this stalk don't look like the seed near there's a tassel but watch watch the tassel doesn't look like the seed the first thing the farmer sitting here it forms a little outside thing to hold the seed form a husk the husk is not the seed no more the tassel that stock was it's only a carrier of the life so you're talking about the life of christ right but the stalk carries the life the blade carries the life it's only carrying the life the life is on a journey to go somewhere when you put the seed in the life is in the seed locked up sealed up covered up wrapped up standing alone seed looking to be buried but when that seed go in the ground it go through processes let's say the process of character development let's say the process of becoming a son of god let's say the process to become like jesus you see a lot of people want stuff but they don't want the process to get to that stuff if they want to get a certificate passing your exams you have to go through the process of studying your schoolwork because somebody's saying amen everything is a process people want a shortcut there is no shortcut oh glory to god give the lord a shout in this word there is no shortcut you come on god's level or you don't come at all my god we don't preach in the church we are preaching to the bride that's who i feel i'm preaching to this morning [Applause] oh hallelujah i feel there are mature people here ready to take the word and say pilate on me preacher pour it on hit me with it suck it to me give it to me loose it upon me that's what we want the word coming knocking out things that look like christ punching out things not like christ you're coming here for punches yes you're coming here to be cut you're coming out to be corrected you're committed to be instructed you don't come here to give advice you're not coming to teach the preacher you're not coming to come and play god in this church no no you're not coming for that all scripture is given by inspiration and it's profitable for doctrine reproof instructions that's what we're here for we have not been this way before but our fire is here leading us guiding us that's why we are so inspired because there's a fire that is here oh glory to god and as we move closer trials will move hotter that's what the devil does as you're narrowing your portion the devil is mad because he could never take your place he could never receive the holy ghost and he knows something is about to break forth we could sense it we could feel it we are inspired by the expectation of it something is about to break forth or a short quick message that could just shake the whole nation we know it's gonna come what if it's gonna come it's gonna come because god said so [Applause] what i'm talking about when people come up with a platform you say the devil doesn't let the gas close i was a carry on do not take expose at all he said he noticed when your body got a breakthrough in the forest he is praying mosquito coming all kind of thing disturbing when he's just about to get a breakthrough it's mosquito with all kind of issues and all kind of demons want to come and pop yourself up because you're pushing a victory and they're trying to cut your victory off but today we gonna expose him we can have the victory anyhow come on now how many feet are to have that victory how many believe in another victory oh god breathed out for victory oh glory to god early in jesus ministry he should be there for perfect as my father no love oh jesus he don't wait for you to be where you supposed to be [Applause] he could watch a woman say that's a butterfly from a human standpoint you see worm but from god's son he's about to fly so jesus see these rugged cuss bud hot tempered bed up some of them ben who he asked to follow him young guys wasn't easier [Music] they had family who wasn't easy you know one and mother come to jesus i want two more boys one cent on your left and one side on your right there was the easier they were trusting one another to to be next to him you know you think jesus didn't know all that inter-brederin issues among them minister so-called he knew all of that but he called all of them anyhow anyhow i'm not hearing you i'm not here but jesus didn't hold back what was their promise i love him that's what i love about him he's not going to hold back what he promised you he said be therefore perfect [Applause] in other words i am commissioning you to be perfect [Applause] and to prove that you're going to be perfect you may be succeeding i'm going to take the scriptures from ephesians 4 11-13 and i'm going to elect predestinated for ordain these gifts apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists four [Music] four the perfecting of the saints so when god wants to move to fulfill his word of commission you to be perfected it means god must elect a bunch of men not man chosen man but god god man [Applause] but i want to bring another deeper i want to show you that the faithful ministry will be adopted sons [Applause] not hoping to make it somebody may say i hope these words bless your heart this is not that and you know i mean i i already prepared nothing you know but i hope no no not that we're talking about men that's speaking as the oracles of god men that has been in this presence men that heard from heaven men that have been in the presence of the pillar of fire and know that god is god that's what we're talking about because in the last days we have promised that the pride will be the final voice to the final age and he said once more the world will hear direct from god when last the word here direct from god when god said malachi 4. but sodom and luke 17 30 the world was airing direct from god but he prophesied that the bride who is she she is still being called out because the bride have to have character the bride has to be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone spirit of his spirit therefore the bride must go through the process of corrupted development come on give the lord a shout of prayer therefore the bride must come to her place of trying [Applause] you see you can't just say but the pasta you know he going through his stuff yeah that's his place of trying pasta not going through your place of trying for you i know you want to preach sometimes that could do some interceding which is praying that's the easy part but when you talk about police are trying that's your place nobody can't go through that nobody can sign that up for you you know i'm going to take my husband please for of trying no it doesn't work that way is the trial of your faith not all your faith your your faith so when you're looking to lean on somebody you see all them who talking and hiding and bobbing and weaving and they're ducking behind this one because they think it's our fate is it no your fate he said i came to deliver the fate that was once delivered to the saints you see the faith is what led peter to do what he did their faith is what that people say silver and gold having none such that that was the fate this faith said philip to the ethiopian unit the faith did that isn't that right the faith in what was leading these guys because they are sons not chicken sons they were eager in them i think together that was better with eagles you see chickens have mother hen and manchester brooding and eagles different as soon as their age mother just flicked them out and you'll get them uncomfortable in their nests because everybody have a cool comfort spot in mother's nest and and they don't know yet they're not born to sit on a nest they were born to fly they don't even know the purpose of their wings they don't know their potential yet they only under mummy because mommy flies out and bring back food for them mommy flies out and see them mommy fires out and brings stuff for them but after a while they get too big for the nest it begins to get uncomfortable and the mommy begins to rip off what was smooth and what was necessary when they were small until the sticks that was under all those smooth stuff begin to stick them up and begin to give them a very uncomfortable trying situation in which they find a cell can lie down this way because this thing pushing them here they can't take it easy here they're being sticked up the mommy is groundly trying to phase them out from phase two to phase three because for extremes they have that fly come on see him and somebody so first you make it sticky in the nest make it uncomfortable and i hope god do that for you today make things so uncomfortable you feel we stick in here you're sticking here you don't even know if you want to come back to the church that's fine that's okay that's what we just want pride members inside of here we want the church members they could go bye-bye but the bride she wants the word she wants god she wants the word to become flesh come on say him and somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory because you know it's the same beat the same way this until something external happens so the morning the mother decides to get them fellas a solo flight tell them jump in my wings and they hook their beaks into them break my eagle wings and the mother take my fly man that feeling good they're feeling their merry-go-round they feel that on them things go up and down so and the mother just doing like that and they're feeling good maybe she did that and clearly straight back to the nurse they said mommy are we having a wonderland again tomorrow she said sure son show children another one tomorrow and she get another one tomorrow are we having another one yes at this time your mom may do something different when she flies she flipped them off you talk about scream they find it was very strange they thought they were dying they thought all hope was lost they thought this was not what i signed up for for christianity fine like i'm dying who would help me who's looking for me who visited me who praying for me who helping me all of a sudden mommy

word of god hallelujah you ain't come church you can fight with deacon and elder and pastor i found this is horrible after all the devil fighting outside to come inside that sylvester fight oh god mercy jesus there's a place that had the joy of the lord there's a place to have strength there's the place where they get battered in your job they will slap you up slap you up when you come here you put oil [Applause] you get the refreshing of the spirit of god all them terrorists and she had us under school all those people trying to get you out of the spirit all the world blinking here look at me look at me look at me and you're trying to hold your eyes together and it's this you're hearing this music and that music and you're trying to walk through this narrow road praise god and when you pass through hell to get to church you meet helen here no we cast in hell out this morning the person next to you is your brother the person next to you is your sister don't let the devil tell you all the way shake somebody and let you among god bless you glory hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so god put an original seed into the ground and that seed began to unfold now here what happened notice the life that was in the stalk the tassel ends up in the seed the light that come on the original seed come to different processes and then turn back there we go to its original condition so when the life begins to unfold through the stalk through the leaves to the tassel it comes back against the seed then the life gathers all the seeds gathers up all the life then everything else dries up so when you begin to see others just drying up that's not you you're not drying up you getting ripened up you're getting mature you're getting to be perfect oh hallelujah oh glory notice this is the bomb the life that was in the store husk in the tassel gathers up in the seed the life that was in the stalk went to make another justification made away for signification san sanification made away for the battle of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down in perfection the holy ghost must come down in perfection therefore there is going to be a perfect people on the earth the holy ghost is going to come down in perfection and back to the word to manifest itself so brahman says when the green life begins to leave the husk and go to make the brain the bride he called the bride the grain the green cardinal itself so when the wood is thrown at you you can't say you do believe that you accept that when all these promises is flung at you you receive them because he said the green listen when the life begins to leave the hustle go into the green the bride the hearts open up and excommunicate the grain so this is part of the package ex communication how could brethren do me that do you they have to do you that because you are green and that's husk pulling back to give you room [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you realize they were tightening you all along cramping you all along but when the hospital back you feel the dance like david dance you have the liberty you have the freedom you have the authority you have inspiration why because the hospital that they have to pull back because they can handle the grain the grain could only get right you see while it is not ready the grain is protected by the husk yes while it is young the husk is green and the grain is green but then goes on to increase the sun here place a trial trial of your faith that increase the test and as the sun get hotter the huts begin to go dry yellow but the grain starting to get ripe golden brown you call it golden brown it begins to get mature because it's getting ready to die the dynamic is going to drive the people to calvary and get into the rapture oh glory to god but you've got to become the grain that's why you come to church by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature you come to church to get promised after promise of the promise lord reader god didn't come to church for me to explain newsweek magazine and thai magazine on an article in in in some science magazine that's not what you come to church for they come to church and your promises god promised you the holy ghost god promised you deliverance god promised you family god promised you a breakthrough you come to your promises and your faith has taken a hold of these promises my god you could take them and say god you said so you can't lie [Applause] amen [Applause] my lord and when the seed word begins to go forward the husk puts it from itself here we go ready for this the life leaves all the others to follow it and that's the true believers they follow the life wherever their life goes not interpretation not more mysteries the life related yes for the life southern angels give him eternity to guard up this cattle world to tie it back into the world to bring longer life which was the holy ghost itself and the holy ghost came down but he couldn't give us the holy ghost it came as the word because the mystery of god come down from god as the word and the word is a seed and the seed has to be preached [Applause] that's why the devil didn't understand the mystery of god because the mystery is or the secret is the word is in the brain devil didn't understand that he didn't understand the word wasn't in your spirit or your flesh yet it was in your soul you had a gene inside a deer and because you were covered up by the shock of your spirit by the shock of your flesh but the seed of the attribute of who you are was inside your soul so the shock could have done this adultery and fornication and lie that has nothing with the seed the mystery that was inside the deer now the mystery was how to connect what was in your soul to what god spoke because elohim is thought logos is word word is taught express and once the word is spoken the word become the conductor of the spirit to make it come to pass so once god thinks it and he speaks it and the spirit flows through it it's got to come to prayer [Music] glory glory glory are you with me are you with me so watch god say let there be light hallelujah god created and he said he said there was darkness and the spirit begin to move you see because the word has to be spoken for the spirit to begin to move because the word is the conductor of the spirit so god has to restore the conductor of the spirit which is the word and once the word is restored the spirit can now move so when the sons become the word the sons become the conductor and the spirit begins to move to the sons of god the last days there is my spirit flowing freely [Applause] you are sealed i see your shoes on both sides whether you're going to come in they see the reel just the same when a man or woman possesses this all these virtues here then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost then the word manifests itself that makes it a complete tabernacle of the living god hallelujah my then you become watch a living example of christianity what christ was these people are because his life is in there they are in christ and their life is dead and then you reckon yourself dead then you're born of fate then virtue and these are the things that added tell you a perfect living image of god isn't that right and it's not wonderful god has brought seven church ages to show seven steps he brought building this individual into his image he built a complete church in his image and at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it's a bride just remember we are not the only bride we are the capstone bride the bride has been formed throughout the ages it's already filled up so we can't go back to luta we can't fit into wesley we can't fit in any past age we have to fit in our age we have to fit in the magnetism of the holy ghost to pull the rest of them up so we are the capstone that the holy ghost itself could come down as that power magnet to raise them from the grave in other words we've got to come to perfection in order to produce a resurrection isn't that right you are going to be perfect you've got to press onto perfection perfection is our goal isn't that right oh glory to god what more shall we say to these things hebrews 11 oh true faith subdued kingdoms brought righteousness there was stone sword asunder is not right having a good report through faith god provides some things better for us they without us are not made perfect so they need us to complete them oh glory to god do you understand what i'm saying they need us to complete them to bring up the whole body that's the responsibility that's been given this last day church we are not a church to produce another church we are church to raise the dead to tell me a resurrection come on say him and somebody are you with me oh hallelujah you get it you must be seated here we go oh glory these people who died [Applause] let me bring it real to you if i die i'll be written on you don't keep him written long enough hallelujah in other words you have got to come to perfection let's go these people who die are dependent on waiting on us here we go look my own ways so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection they are souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection and this church is is coming smaller in the minority watch it's come to a needle point we have got to get into a place here we go until it's the same kind of ministry that was left because when the headstone come it can't come and connect the brotherly kindness there it has to come and that holy spirit is where the ministry of the bride gonna be at it's gonna be a holy spirit ministry because the spirit christ have to connect with that isn't that right are you with me now blessed be the name of the lord so you say when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of christ will have to be honed that's a different word that delivered metal work according to a sharp point milliliter i forget all them skills we see this long time uh caliper caliper sometimes you grab fat and ground tin another adjusted caliper because you have to get it this fraction so you have to hone that go through a process of honing wholeness possession you're just chopping you know a whole nother [Music] so if i say i'm not affecting you much is when you're writing gonna come this is what we're talking about the real thing going to come that's just still microphone stuff don't bother get fooled with that the rare horn and it's coming you're going to be cut down to the world only you're going to be just like jesus your wife going to see you like jesus your husband's going to see it like jesus you're going to be just like christ could somebody say amen glory hallelujah so therefore it has to be so perfect like christ till when it comes he and that ministry will fit smack together then will the rapture come amen since somebody got a boy rapper to wrap the trumpet right now jump it trumpet jump and trumpet and there's no ministry around like this that is a kind of you know not cuckoo but they don't like i told her brother who who believed he fought on your side say keep on i'm going to get there you you are here oh my soul's impressive here we go tree is perfection here we go i love this the ministry talking about the ministry fifa ministry the ministry comes with perfection when when it preaches mysteries when have more mysteries to preach deeper mysteries hidden mysteries no listen to this the ministry come to his perfection when it reproduced christ again in natural among human beings amen [Music] christ have to be oozing out that man reproduce not spiritual these are not plain words you know reproduce in natural he healed the sick he raised the dead but i branham i understand when he walked there was an anointing around him you couldn't just walk up to him hey brother but no you couldn't do that you got checked because i wronged him there was a glory and there was a power and there was a presence just like jesus [Applause] so indeed called the deep woman coming up and the woman just doing but he said that just his presence and he's living in this he is walking in this he is operating in this and that's going to come back you'll be living in it you'll be walking in it you'll be you'll be part of your being christ in you the hope of glory oh give the lord a shout of [Applause] from the unveiling of praise yeah written epistles right of all men turn that around just turn around yeah epistles that have been written and peter and john to show it when they went up there they perceived they were ignorant and unlearned they had no education but they take notice that they've been with jesus they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that they had been with jesus cause here we go jesus was manifesting himself through them christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive as was in moses oh hallelujah christ veiled manifested in them he said now watch that's the thing god will do to his sons on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he replaced to the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanted his work done he sent it to his son the son wanted his work done sent into the church at that day you will know i am in the father the father me and you and me and i knew at that day because here we go the same power of god was the jehovah god rest in jesus christ and the same power that rest in jesus christ rest in placed sons in the body of christ not place son's place in conventions place sons in the body now no man could put you in the body it by one spirit you are baptized into the body isn't that right so the holy ghost puts you into the body and in that body you have a position are you with me oh hallelujah the pillar of fire is identified scientifically by the reaction by its character and everything else and as it was when it was dwelling the body of god's only begotten son so that it dwell in the body of his adopted sons for the last day let's read back the scripture we read how highly god regardless of working of patience is seen in james 1 4 let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lack of nothing god's will for us is perfection that's his will that's his will that's why jezebel for perfect he put that promise upon the pedia for perfect are you only perfect except there are seven perfect spirits to be loosed on the earth to wrap you up in it is dumb spirits come from god to bring you back to perfection remember the working in the beginning but the seven perfect was before the beginning that's where our gene took a hold before the beginning lucifer only come in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word said let there be angels let there be this let there be that let there be lucy are you with me but before the beginning was spirit taught that we were connected to him so before the devil was created we were [Applause] oh glory to god amen [Music] okay let's go hebrews 2 9. we see jesus who has been a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor and he by the grace of god should take debt for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect true suffering that's jesus perfect to suffering hebrews 5 8-9 though he was son yet learn the obedience so sorry i'm not so sorry it'll be another gift you're not saying no no you have to learn obedience but here it is he learned obedience by the things which he suffered [Music] oh now the babies the baby's feeling uncomfortable right now and being made perfect he became the order of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him first peter 5 10 but the god of all grace who had called us to his eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you okay with the lord of praise [Applause] we pray for the course of the word and god has a set time and has a purpose for everything that he does there's nothing happen just accidentally to those who love the lord and accord according to his will isn't that right we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie and everything has its time it's season it has its way god is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us here we go those things are put upon us trials and wonderings it is testing to see how you will react on an action god by putting trials destined and wanderings to see how you were to fear how you gonna make out because he's looking for a reaction from you based upon the situations that is surrounding your life are you with me no matter if you notice she has made herself ready so many says if the lord will take his evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying stealing i'll serve him that's up to you you have got something to do david overcome shall inherit all things they didn't overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready you see god could not push us through a pipe and pull us on the other end and say blessed that he will overcome it you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you have got to make decisions yourself i had to make a decision myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to god could we say amen are you with me so therefore the choices is yours you are the decision if you're going to come to church this morning and you have a decision this morning if you're going to stay alive to hear the word of worship or praise god i receive it because we are going to go on to perfection there's going to be a bunch of people in here that are going to press on the perfection could we take some more it's early and i'm all getting warmed up hallelujah glory glory glory no watch abraham was promised a child amen but he must maintain that promise for 25 years promise maintenance promise given and god checking you how how you're maintaining that promise or you're disbelieving the promise or you're grumbling about the promise or you're complaining why it seems so long and you alter the spirit with the promise no maintenance he had to maintain it listen the ups and downs that he had the temptations in those 25 years but he held to the word of promise so wait a minute you think abram was walking in a straight line no he had ziggs and zags he had ups and downs you feel that straight what god said so in jesus name and 25 years your time abram do you want to go home and see sarah fitz do you know what type of man say you're going to sleep somewhere else your time what kind of battery brahma been through his ops his dongs but you know god said so god gave him a promise and if god given that promise god can't lie oh hallelujah glory to god how many of you excited this morning if you're feeling tired and if you're going to worry just stand up for soap jump for no cause shout for no reason whatsoever just make your own noise let the devil know that you believe this promise anyhow [Applause] they say that might be one crazy picture but the most craziest preacher ever here nobody preached like that i know we are crazy we work you see all them saying preachers and saying churches they aren't going nowhere so i decided to break the trend mash up the the elder stuff oh everybody know it i am not going that way we doing different because we want a revival real bad listen to this all right let's go a little further israel was promised the promised land and they had to fight every inch of it wherever the soul you're featured upon go tell joshua the land is there but you have to fight for it and that's the same way for divine healing god's got power to heal you if you got the courage accepted but you have to fight every inch of the way god got amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you have to fight every inch of your way i've been behind this pulpit for over 31 years and every inch have been a fight constantly we must fight if we must reign [Applause] so what do you think i am doing here this morning this is no picnic for me this is a fight and so help me god i'll fight if i lose my teeth i'll use my gums but i'm going to fight if i can't walk i'll use my walking stick but i'm going to fight what about you inside of here oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen amen amen oh hallelujah glory to god glory to god [Applause] [Music] i was standing talking about afraid the holy spirit said go out to yourself and i moved into the bush a little place he told me there's a trap set for you be careful now who's talking god is talking to the man he didn't tell me how or what so god leave it hanging there be careful a chaplain is there for you i come back to about a friend went to church at night and known to the people next night it happened standing there he told me upon some muckers it's in your hands do with them whatever you happen a young man and young woman they're trying to make vulgar love with her in the building everybody attention while i was trying to preach this is in the church building in the building now then people carry on in the building you notice they say come in in that kind of a way people are treating people out you know but this would happen right and he was pull ahead back climb up onto our lap throw our head back trying to kiss her going on that and baron beg them stop it please stop the police all of a sudden the holy spirit dropped down and says he's there in your hands what will you do with them there was a holy hush everybody said deathly quiet i thought oh god what must i do so he's under pressure now what do i do this is a situation what do i do then i remember the warning of the holy spirit two days before and i said i forgive you now now i want you to go a little deeper in this the holy spirit if they say blind they'll be blind if he said that they will die whatever you say is going to happen and he listen to all the options given to him anibal he said i forgive you now he didn't have to say that he said that i'll show you who i am but he said i forgive you and that pleased god and that is what he wanted me to say because here we go after all i've been guilty maybe not of that but i have been guilty and guilty of the lease is guilty of the whole so you do have to place self-righteous you'd have to play more spiritual you'd have to play you more holy than somebody else so cut it out cut it out you'd have to play more legalistic than somebody else cut it out because we're rejecting that this is the word god forgive me he could forgive you and if he could forgive you he could forgive me too oh give the lord praise [Applause] watch then the holy spirit fell through amen you see here we go this is what i want to get i believe that all these things had a meaning what would you do with the power the reaction of an action sometimes something that is come as an act then how do you react do you understand what i mean so therefore the word has always been a reproach god's anointed word has all been reproached and that's the reason it's so hard for people who doesn't understand how to accept that reproach cover your knees everybody above the knees everybody have that you want to address that you don't want to reproach they call you old lady oh dress modestly that's a reproach it have sinners let us dress modestly [Applause] i want to repeat that it have sinful people that are dressed modestly women who respect themselves dressed modestly those who dress in crazy they don't respect themselves that's why it's a spirit upon them it's a sex spirit upon them that is why they dress the way they dress don't let that sex spirit come on you to dress that kind of way whether in church or out to church whether private no don't let that come upon you because this is the word this is god remember the devil is not playing people playing in church but the devil's not playing he come to steal to rob and to destroy at the end of it you ought to destroy your life so be careful oh hallelujah so you always have to stand this reproach in order to give a testing amen or that live godly in christ jesus shall bear persecution but hallelujah so what you're complaining about i'll be saying amen this is the word i'm going to do a call a lot i'll change a message i'm getting fire fire fire fire that was last week this is what i have for today this is fire fire fire in word form glory could somebody say amen this is pastor in the house oh glory so here it is now every man that comes to christ must first be child trained so you can't get character development having your own way i want that to get that i want that i get that i want that that's like training a child everything i want to give them you give them you know i get a spoiled child a rotten child and after was a child feel they entitled and he didn't get what he entitled them they were mashed up the place because they lost their entitlement god don't have any spoiled children every child that coming to god must first be tried child trained for the purpose that god has ordained for you so god wouldn't have nobody running around getting their own will accomplished and vindicated god give me this god give me this go give me this you're giving god right well god give your trials to destin to [Applause] tribulation [Applause] any money and increase our pay thank you for the trials the testing the tribulation what you don't understand come on i'll give the lord a shout out in everything not something not what you like what you don't like give him give him a shout out praise is there some praises in the house now when you start to walk like that then you get the devil confused i don't know and i don't know because i frustrated him so he's still prison i pressed him so he said prison he got money he praised god he lost he paid he praised god he lost his job he still praised god he got two flat tires he still praise god he can't pay his mortgage but he praising god something wrong with that guy that's right that's right something is very wrong devil devil's mind confused con unfulfill his mind confront his mind bother his mind he's confused because when you expect a frog on your face you have a smile the glory of god rests upon you when you are reproached for the world glory is resting upon you you're handling the pressure just right handing your child just right holy spirit just please oh hallelujah holy spirit report to the father you see my son look at the child he's in but he is still blessing me look at the testing he's in but he's still worshiping me look this happened that happened that happened he said the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord that's my son [Applause] that's my daughter that's my job a perfect man on the earth [Applause] job friends not enemies friends come to tell him who you going to not normal something is wrong somewhere you know it check yourself now if the friends tell that too much you might find yourself just checking checking yourself afterwards you're questioning yourself afterwards you're not feeling good about yourself you know just like a dog you have a nice dog and thinking a comedy dog waggy tail did you okay i'll say are you depressed you're happy to see you the dog not vex you come on veggie dog veggies too the dog loves to see you don't get any food you don't have one nice reaction every time it's consistent it is unconditional it is just every day's same way waggis daily carry on because he's happy to see you that's how god is god is happy to see you in church you had a hard day's work but the dog happy to see you lord happy to see you because you have an opportunity to whisper love secret in your air because you are his bride you his wife you are in the right place for him to give you revelation all of a sudden something drop in your heart that you can explain to nobody else move back the spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah simeon was an old man but as revealed to him by the spirit he will not see death till he sees the lord's christ god didn't tell her to his neighbor god didn't tell her to his friend playing giraffes or child isn't that right he was on his own thing when god spoke that to him he knew because god told him so so he was in the spirit and that service when mary passed by with baby jesus simon was moved by the spirit it had lots of mothers that day lots of babies that day but he was moved by the spirit something moved him because the same god that told him he will not see death till he see the lord's christ at that same court at the appointed time move upon him to witness that christ somewhere somewhere in the building oh glory [Applause] are you with me god can't lie god wouldn't leave you wrong [Applause] could somebody say hey man simeon passed this woman that woman that child and there was one pretty pretty baby if you see that baby but that wasn't jesus see what i could see see myself there's a pretty one oh look at that hands up that's a nice guy but i know jesus just keep moving on spirits keep on moving keep on moving now it's not my looks don't wanna actually hear that one has straight yes i want that no that's a long baby that's a fat baby look like an anointed baby but i know jesus you look like you'll be a preacher jesus yes goddess telling me go see preachers alone baby preachers baby apostles baby prophets baby no jesus the christ when he reached mary yes mary is is it him this guy in his spirit take up the baby you are you think mary you feel this this old man coming together baby hey old man she had to be spiritual because if if he's got any spiritual

pounds and peace for my eyes i've seen the glory and salvation [Music] [Applause] and if you think it's by chance or luck that simeon bounces mary he come blind on her now you know she can see she cannot see that's a blind woman that woman can't see one thing but she is coming because god wants a blind woman identify messiah oh come on now come on you know she can't see anybody you know she is she has to be led by the spirit and i pass this one that one that one comes straight to mary oh you talk about the this is the god we serve he's a god that leads he's a god that [Applause] oh let's give the lord a worship offering tonight [Applause] hallelujah oh glory yes ron you may be seated praise god praise god amen hallelujah so every christian ought to know that trials will come and seem everywhere to you but remember god has a purpose it will work out right say after me it will work out right say it again it will work out right every one of you going through something inside of your pocket will work out right get the lord and shout out praise it okay let's continue matthew 3 16 to 17 and jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water amen and lord the heavens were open unto him he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove lighting upon him and a voice from him saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased this is my son that's beautiful that's matthew 3 and then of that verse is 17 but you know what happened to matthew 4 then was jesus let up of the spirit are you still with me i know you all like that one this is my beloved son but that close off matthew 3 17 we we're gonna go to four now the spirit said this is my son and whom this is my man i'm pleased with him i'm pleased to send him out here is where then was jesus let up oh we are feeling mature inside here a few people receiving the word now we in the scriptures now but a punch then was jesus let up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil i'm listening i'm listening i'm the amen thermometer on the underwood and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was hungered that's terrible after he fasted the devil come to tempt him with some fresh bread i mean you could smell it when you're hungry like that so i mean you could eat anything and the devil said if thou be the son of god command that these stone be made bread and he answered and said is written man shall never bread alone but by every word but she does the more of god devil take up the high mountain holy city set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said if there will be the son of god cast myself down for it is written never going into the word now quoting through he using quotes he shall give his angels charged over considering thee and they have the same devil token he just quote him he shall give it in the charge concerning the and in their hands are they buried up at least any time though shall dodge their foot is it against a stone it's incredible how he just finds scriptures and come to go to jesus and jesus said it is written again thou shalt not attempt the lord thy god again the devil taken up exceeding high mountain showed him all the kingdom of the world and the glory of them and sending them all these things will i give thee if thou will fall on worship me then say jesus get the hand satan for it is written though shall not wish to be like god and him says then the devil leave him ambul angels came and ministered to him luke 4 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit on the galilee and they went out of fame of him throughout the region roundabout that captures the whole thing of the identifying the son a son placed by the holy spirit sent out into the wilderness to be tested and then return the power of the spirit so therefore the dove came on him and positioned him as a son him being positioned as a son was immediately led by the spirit into the wilderness to defeat the devil by the amen this is very important now no power yet but the word it is written it is written it is written so one spirit come upon him to identify him as a son isn't that right two the spirit led him into the wilderness where he used the word and that trial was jesus place of trying where he had to overcome himself lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life so many ministers want to take power over the people poor lies forever churches and so on and you know really powerful men just like governments and prime ministers and presidents but they don't want to take the power over themselves but before a son could be really adopted he has to have power over himself before he could have power over others so jesus demonstrate this in the wilderness isn't that right led by the spirit then go into the wilderness to be tested to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life isn't that right but about ask a question why would god call our people out in this evil age 4 to try here i want you to say amen on that why this is some god what would god call of people out of this english for his name the reason is to try her the bride isn't that right blessed be the lord so after defeating the devil by the word tested proven isn't that right he returned in the power of the spirit showing that the spirit he received turned into word he went through the test by the word and then the word turned back into spirit he returned to the power of the spirit the spirit and the word is the same could we say amen oh glory to god the words that he speak they are spirit and they are life isn't that right so therefore we find out in the old testament caleb was the only one that driver the philistines the other tribes failed we don't want to be like that you don't want to be like that you want to be the tribe that overcome and drive out your philistines so you have to fight isn't that right because there is going to be a battle to possess your inheritance how many know the inheritance not just coming down you're going to fight for what you know is yours i say it again you're going to fight what has been revealed to you as yours that's different if it's not revealed to you you can't even claim it as yours but once it's revealed to you give me my mountain david mountain not hebrew mountain not this one mountain my own because god said that monk in his mind and when the spirit focuses on what is yours you get locked in amen hallelujah hallelujah so therefore there's going to be some sons that are going to be adopted all right let's go quickly now remember this from a guide these are the things that build a servant of christ for it first and virtue now remember here we go the holy spirit cannot cap the building of god until these things are operating by the spirit so these virtues have to be operated not by revelation well you know a brother come i i shall body cancer god bless you my brother know that that kind of makeup thing that artificial thing we do not want artificial other kinds that dry it up no for now depending upon who it is and what not that temporary kindness we're talking about operating by the spirit the spirit taking a hold of these virtues and bringing it alive so what could throw you in any situation anywhere in other words jesus busted his own disciples he said you have to have love more than the pharisees because they have loved their loved one budget too he said yeah that love who is not your own everybody is cool where they feel comfortable everybody is fine where they are comfortable but jesus said if you're in an uncomfortable situation you have to act right too you have to display it right also so for god to test you you know you had to get you outside the circle your speaker okay so no matter what you do these are the things that build the body of christ those things only long again but this is solid stuff first faith virtue knowledge is to be added until the company such a crisis is manifest then the holy spirit comes upon it and seizes one body ordination remember this morning lesson these virtues have to be in there before the caption will come on it you might shout you might speak in tongues that has nothing to do with it until these things are scripturally proven is sealed into you wait wait wait wait wait wait these things have to be scripturally proven so how god got tested by somebody who don't like you could do something to you in other words it has to come out automatically notice but iran didn't ramp up something and said what shall i do have i called for that um that that you know no he couldn't ramp up that it had to come from inside of him he said i forgive you that came out of him it is not right okay now out of your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness to your brother and his holy spirit and christ will come because just beneath him the holy spirit is the spirit of jesus christ into the church to manifest those virtues i pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help here we go and by his grace i pray i'll seek daily here we go church seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements is fluent in this whole statute of mind delight can be a manifestation of the living christ for he became sin like me that i might become righteous of god like him he took my place lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for how many people pledge that same thing by the grace this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord o praise god so we are looking for the ministry of the spirit in ephesians that will come into ephesians to operate ephesians 4 11. a five-fold ministry that will bring the bride to perfection isn't that right because that is the brightest earthly goal to be a perfect man on the earth from barbarian paradox i've often wanted to come to church i've longed to see it where i could walk into the back door front door look across the audience and sin couldn't stay there the spirit would call it out it just couldn't stay like a nazi zafar you just couldn't do it there'd be no sin in that group no sir the spirit will quickly speak like that isn't that right it will be done woman and men coming on the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly if something gone wrong they will confess it before the spirit gotta hold it that's the church of the living god oh how my poor heart is getting old i've longed to stand to see a church like that i may yet i hope to perfect works of god without sin he looking for that he was expecting that and i believe with all my heart he's going to have that we're going to have that isn't that right jesus was the word isn't that right and the word was invisible until it was made flesh so now we're talking about the word and tapes the word on books that's just word word being spoken but that word have to come into your faith and your flesh and when the word become flesh it will become visible so no minister i have word made flesh and it's not visible it will become visible because the word conducts the spirit and the spirit will flow freely isn't that right god is ready if he's doing it now he's going to call a church to perfection by his word jesus christ if he's not doing it he will do it do what call a church to perfection oh hallelujah are you with me praise god blessed be the name of the lord you love him oh praise the name of the lord so the seed is back to its original condition it must have all the word to be the seed that's why sexiest could make it it have to be all seven seeds open it must be all the word to be the seed they can't united seven thunders because the seventh thing is kind of the bride the seven doesn't give the bright fate the seventh dinosaur about how we feel it must be all the world to be the seed so if they don't have all the word it's not the seed the prophet came to bring the seed from genesis all the way to revelation and that's the sea that's in you this morning oh glory to god do you believe that praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to the gospel brother okay so i believe okay let me see okay hallelujah i believe in the battle of holy ghost i believe in speaking in tongues he said you take a prisoner speak in tongues with enough timber to fight a bus so you talk about the holy ghost is meekness joy peace long suffering gentleness faith patience that's the fruit of the spirit humility if a brother has gone wrong don't beat him or something go after him see if you can get him back don't wait for the preacher to do it you do it the preacher can't do it all neither can the deacons everybody is a member of this body of christ should go after one another we have got the spirit of christ he taught a great parable he left the 99 and went after one oh blessed be the name of the lord oh praise god musician come on please oh hallelujah oh are you ready brother branham said the flow shall be full of wheat the fats overflowing wine and oil and i'll restore now it says god is going to restore the lutheran age did not restore the church it started reformation the wesleyan age didn't restore the pentecostal it didn't restore but god has to restore because he can't deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration of god god will take the church right back to pentecost at the beginning notice in verse 25 it tells why we need a restoration the locust the pramaum the caterpillar the palmerwoom have eaten all but the root a little bit of the stem now we are told all these insects are one of the same stages that's right they are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false doctrine through the ages and the pauline roots talk is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church but going to bring his original planting back to original seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or for marine how he's bringing it back by the teaching of marine next will come the harvest rain or rapture in faith may the lord bless you oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's come and worship let's praise
