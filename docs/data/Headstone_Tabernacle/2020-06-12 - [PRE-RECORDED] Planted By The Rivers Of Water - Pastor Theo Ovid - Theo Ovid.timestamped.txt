[50:38] ideas on you what we need is a Reviver
[50:41] like that oh we are dip of the Spirit we
[50:44] had spiritual blessings and spiritual
[50:46] appraises but we don't need that no more
[50:49] we need a revival of the Spirit of the
[50:52] Living God in the hearts of the people
[50:54] we don't need much of a dip in the
[50:56] spirit or a spiritual awaken we need a
[50:59] revival of what we got not a spiritual
[51:02] awaken that brings mixed multitude but
[51:04] we need a revival that we sit down and
