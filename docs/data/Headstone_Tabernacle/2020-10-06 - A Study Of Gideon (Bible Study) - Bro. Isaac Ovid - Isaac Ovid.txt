your word we have found comfort in your word we have found encouragement in your word so father may you speak to us once more tonight lord we thank you for the opportunity may you bless the time this evening in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well we are together again just praising the lord and um thanking god for another time where we can have bible study and i always like to preface it by saying that it's not a preaching service um that is for us to kind of go through the scripture and find something to encourage us to push us along the way and i was kind of uh going back and forth you know weighing you know trying to get to catch the mind of the lord for tonight and um i don't know at one point it struck um but i want to before getting that i want to wish uh my brother gideon happy birthday today how many appreciate brother gideon a tremendous blessing as a song leader and as a musician and um you know i don't know at what point it kind of clicked but at some point in time i told my wife i said the lord is putting something on my heart for a study of gideon so i don't know if it's how it's connected to him but um we're gonna do a study of gideon that that would be my text tonight a study of gideon and uh i will be a blessing to you because i know many people have not as as we have done in many sessions slow down and kind of take it um drive slowly to really observe all that god wants us to observe in this passage of scripture so that's where we'll be tonight will be in the book of judges tonight by the grace of god and just so we can kind of get some context some background and um uh the book of judges you know is right after the book of joshua you know and judges is that period after the mighty warrior joshua and before the great mighty king david where for the most part i mean king saul kind of steps in before david but david is the next major stopping point but between joshua and david for about 300 years or so we have a period where there is no king the concept of a king doesn't exist um and isn't there any major prophet operating during that time and it's a it's a period of i guess a new young nation you know coming out of bondage for 400 years you know trying to find themselves so to speak you know so over this period of almost 300 years or so we have a almost a cycle of you know victory servitude sorrow salvation uh you know after 40 years of going through the wilderness after egypt you know they they are they are they have entered into the promised land as it were the 12 tribes of israel have sort of settled into certain areas you know physical locations uh that was assigned to them and the book of judges sort of picks up you know after the book of joshua and kind of delves into this this new land new experiences and and certain challenges begin to arise in there because while joshua was alive the people served the lord you know and you'll see that in joshua 24 but after joshua died it seems that there was nobody with strong leadership great spiritual conviction to take his place to sort of hold the people together and as the generations grew and the bible said they they did not know the lord or they knew not the lord and they did not obey his commandments and having recently settled in this land of israel repeatedly we see this that started in joshua they did not completely drive out and that is where the problem that would have accelerated in judges stemmed from the fact that they did not completely do what god tell him to do with his drive out you know you would recall i would have preached a message one time uh for such a time as this with esther and i would have taken a text you should have killed all your malachites to show how amalek and the amalekites would have run all through scripture even unto esther's time and had israel done what they were supposed to do then amon should not have even existed because he should have been wiped out you know so the children of israel almost collectively for failed to utterly drive out because that's the way the language was written you know and when god gives an instruction he expects a hundred percent effort to it he doesn't expect you to do it halfway or partway you know so you say utterly destroy utterly wipe out you know so that would have been the instruction but the children of israel fear to utterly drive out all of the canaanite inhabitants and they call it incomplete victories led to scatterings of enemies and these canaanites tribes in between and betwixt the various tribes and this will lead to invasions skirmishes ambushes crops being stolen and and the blurring and this is where the problem is a blurring of the lines of the teaching they would have gotten from moses that would have been followed through by joshua of a clean line of teaching to a blending in of what they were taught with forced doctrine and pagan worship and idolatry and heathenism and all of this would have slipped in and the bible said by the time you read judges too they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods plural the gods of the people that were around them and bow themselves unto them and provoke the lord to anger you know and so that is the kind of kind of the backdrop there you know so we're going to begin to build into gideon but before i even get there i want to firstly just bring context that during this time and it's so wonderful when you could see it through how the prophet brought it and then true how scripture is that throughout history every man of god was chosen could have only done up to the point that was revealed to him and as much as someone had a desire to do the best that he could god would have allowed certain things to happen because only christ was to fulfill that perfection all right so as you look through it you see man making his very best effort and we thank god because after the ministry of jesus christ now perfection now is open to us that day without us are not made perfect so we would be the perfection that they would have but we are comforted by the fact that in the book of hebrews all those heroes of faith were justified you know and when you read hebrews 11 you know you read about by faith moses and you go down and and what shall i say by verse 32 for for for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of baroque and of samson and and goes on and on and on and on so let's kind of dive uh into it tonight um and see what the lord will do for us this evening so we are in judges we are in judges chapter six and we're going to read from verse one all right so let's go and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of media in seven years so because of the evil in the sight of the lord the lord allowed them to be captured controlled pressured put under pressure by median not for one month not for a year but for seven years and the bible says in verse two and the hand of media and prevailed against israel and because of the media nights the churn of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds so the pressure of the medianites was so great that the dens and the caves that were in the mountains was because the children of israel went and hide and and and create these hiding spaces i want us to understand how what pressure could make people do because they were out of order because they were out of the will of god god allowed the media night to take over to take possession to have the upper hand so to speak and in the amplified in verse 2 it says the powerful hand of media prevailed against israel and because of media and the sons of israel made of themselves or hideouts which were in the mountains and caves verse 3 and so it was when israel had sown so israel still trying to operate now i want us to understand the backdrop they are out of order the reason they are in this position is because they have stepped away from what god wanted i wanted to catch this so it's not as if they are in order it's not as if they are any will of god because here it is it is because they did evil in the sight of god so you see people here doing evil inside of god but they're still trying they're still trying to live it's still trying to operate verse 3 and so it was when israel had sown so they planned their crop or whatever that the media knights came up and the medianites just so you get some perspective of emilianize themselves median was one of the sons of abraham so we know abraham's first son was ishmael he would have had isaac as a son through sarah one of abraham's wife named katura had a son named miriam all right so median is is is actually relatives of the israelites all right so he would also be sons of abraham you will also remember that in the time of moses when moses ran out of egypt he ended up in the land of me of median in fact jetro who was his father-in-law was a priest of million so there was a time when moses coming out of egypt you would recall if you recall ten commandments that when he came in to median and that's where he would have seen the wife and the wife would have explain the burden bush and all this stuff was taking place in the context of of that but the bible would say later on that the medianites allowed idolatry idolatry was found within this so so just to get a backdrop of who these media knights are and god would have told moses to punish the media knights that was coming out of of of egypt and all this stuff so there's history there with israel and the media knights but we see in blue street it was when israel had sown that the midianites came but not just the millionaires only and this is what i want to get at media or the media knights were not known for being the real warrior warrior type you got throughout biblical history you hear about the amalekites the philistines jebusites all of these different heights all right out of all the ice if you want to call it the worst height you can find was the amalekites out of amalek and god particularly had issue with amalek and the amalekites because when the children of israel had left egypt they had no army they didn't know how to fight they were coming out of 400 years of slavery they had no military strategy the bible said that in their wounded defeated condition basically the amalekites attacked them and god was so upset that the amalekites were trying to pounce on weakness or the perception of weakness that he he wanted to blot them out more than once in scripture you see the command to block out the amalekites but he pointed with the highlight here is they are under oppression of the medianites but right behind immediate nights the bible says and the amalekites are there and the amalekites and the children of the east the children of the east here will be talking about descendants of ishmael or the ishmaelites all right east of palestine all right even they came up against them so it shows here that although i want us to capture the trajectory here they fell out to the will of god they begin to adopt idolatry they begin to accept hedonism they walk away from god and god put them under the midianites but under the media nights they are not correcting their behavior and along with the millionaires come in words and i want us to understand that when you walk out to the will of god it is not as if they didn't know what to do this is judges this is not too far after joshua this is not too far after moses understand this 400 years of bondage god put them here for seven years seven years is a fraction of the time there would have been enough stories enough history enough of what you went through in egypt for you to just throw away the great deliverer and forget the god who took your true 40 years in the wilderness and the god who gave you the land they were too close to enough testimonies about god and miracles to end up in this position and yet still i wanted to stick edges so and so it was when israel had sown that the media knights came up and the amalekites and the churning of the east even they came up against them and verse 4 and they encount against them and destroy the increase of the earth so whenever they plant whenever it reach harvest they come and destroy it till don't come under gaza so in other words everything they do was taken from them and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass no i want us to get something here when you're planting anybody one time planting and harvest if you plant something you expect to reap now i could understand if you do it one year and you lose it after one year that will make you feel a certain kind of way let's say you do it for another year it'll make you feel a certain kind of way but it was year after year this is going on for verse 5 for they came up with their cattle this is how the enemy came with their cattle and their tents so they just come and they they just arrive through you know become an established presence for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for a multitude for both they and their camels were without number so when they invaded they came and in the amplified it says they were innumerable so the children of israel couldn't even count the sight of the enemy for a multitude for brody and their comments were outnumbered and they entered into the land to destroy it and israel verse 6 was greatly impoverished because of the media knights and the children of israel cried unto the lord seven years and it came to pass so i wanted to catch a little teaching here and it came to pass when the churning vessel cried unto the lord because of the media nights so in other words yeah one they wasn't crying year two they wasn't crying he had three they wasn't crying he had four they wasn't crying because the bible said as soon as they cried unto the lord the lord took action so the question is how much pressure are people willing to trying to solve in their own way before they want to correct their ways i want us to catch this and we're going to go a little deeper we're going to see where the teaching is going to go and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the media knights that the lord sent a prophet this is not a major prophet it doesn't call his name this is a minor prophet that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage so the prophet is reminding them and i deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwelt but he have not obeyed my voice so all of their cries was being met with context because all of the crying still didn't come with repentance i want us to catch this all of the crying did not come with repentance so god is responding to the cry but he's telling them i'm not hearing you're repenting you're crying but you're not ready to change the behavior you're crying but you're not ready to change your ways you're crying but you're not saying to me you're willing to put me back where i'm supposed to be and get rid of the idolatry i want this to catch it so he's responding and saying i've done all these things but you have not obeyed my voice nevertheless we come to verse 11 which is sort of the context of beginning to build this god begins to say okay let me do something about this let me begin to take some action and they came in verse 11 an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was an opera that pertained unto joash the abyssalite and his son gideon trash wheat by the wine press to hide it from the media night so i wanted to see a picture here you have gideon he is working he is stressing wheat not on the tressing floor he is stretching wheat wheat is normally trash in the open so that the wind would drive the shaft away gideon is working in hiding he is doing the job of wheat in a wine press because a wine press is normally just normally have wine in the underground kind of environment the wine cellars are kind of underground things so gideon is hiding gideon is scared for his life he is petrified that if the media knights only see what he is doing that they will come and take it from before even finished while gideon is hiding trying to trash his wheat call it on the ground there is an angel of the lord who is sitting under a tree he's just sitting there i guess waiting for the right moment maybe tell gideon stop doing what he's doing to pay attention and the bible said in verse 12 when the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee the mighty man of allah and many times we preach on this and we talk about the mighty man of allah and verse 13 and he then said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and he goes on and where he all the miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord had forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the medianites but abraham said he loves this because he didn't was a man of scripture he knew the word israel is backslidden but gideon has not forgotten you would israel is in a bacterium condition but he hasn't forgotten what god took him from what god took him through so he's saying if god is ready for us then where are all the miracles where where are all these signs why are we going through this now bear in mind to this point we still haven't heard the word repentance i want us to to know that there's no mental because if i'm saying where all the miracles and i'm not talking about changing my way to what got me in this place in the first place i want us to catch that and and i remember years ago a brother called me and said but where are all these signs and he wanders and is when i was studying this i really get the answer that i wanted to get because people sit down in church and they have their idols and they say where are the miracles or the signs or something to my life and there's no place or no attempt to truly repent and put god where he's supposed to be and we're gonna get into what people normally do and how god began to correct the pieces of it are you with me tonight anybody catching this and the lord looked upon him so the lord in the face and by the banana made it clear he's saying see this lord is capital so he said it's not an angel now this is the lord now speaking to gideon all right the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the media knights have not i send thee so all the talk that gideon given god push it back on him and say go with your might you you go with your might go in this and thou shalt steal israel from the hand of the media knights have not i send thee and verse 15 and he said unto him o my lord wherewit shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house so gideon i want to stop paying this picture of this i want to use in quotations at this point quote unquote mighty manavalo i want us to take snapshots of the life of this mighty man of allah first snapshot is him hiding trying to do some wheat in hawaiian press because he doesn't want anybody to see him then the next shot of this mighty man of allah is him identifying his tribe now manasseh when you look at the tribes there are tribes whose names are recognized for different reasons so you hear the tribe of levite the line of the priest the tribe of judah the lion of the child but judah the judah and the kings you hear about god was a warrior tribe so you hear all how much you hear about the time of manasseh you have a tribal benjamin manasseh is not it's not a big tribe but out in the tribe of manasseh he's saying but listen my family is poor and in my family i'm the least in my father's house so at this point i wanted to catch the fact that we have so far to meet this description of mighty man of allah we have a man who is afraid to go outside to show he's working we have a man who is petrified who know enough word to be able to say well we're supposed to be doing better than we doing right now you know and then he further goes to say but the reality of my situation is i'm a nobody my family is nobody the line i'm in the tribe i'm in and me within my family i really got the credentials for this job description that you're given to me all right everybody with me and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the media knights as one man now this here is a powerful scripture you know what it is for the lord to say i will be with you so the lord is telling you that i will be with you and i and thou shalt smite the media knights as one man in the amplified that is saying and i will be with you and strike down the media knights as if they were only one man in other words he is taking the whole army of the armenian knights and say imagine all of the immediate knights is one man you guys have to strike you know one man and this this this thing is finished so i want to see the perspective so gideon is wrestling with this because god is saying is as if anything just one man this whole great army which we just described earlier as innumerable you can't con them they come and set up their tent they come in and take everything for seven years you have no food and you who nobody will regard as a soldier you're really a farmer you're not you're not in the army anybody with me tonight but you are the one i'm going to use and i'm going to be with you all right let's build verse 17 and he said unto him if the if no i have found grace in thy then show me a sign that thou talkers with me so gideon one thing he is he he won the he writer challenge and tester so he said the path not hence in other words don't go anywhere i pray that until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said the angel said i will tarry until thou come again so gideon is saying i want to present something to to kind of verify who you are don't go anywhere i'm coming back just know and the angel says to him wherever he had to do go and do it i waited right here any bible said in verse 19 and gideon went in and made ready a kid and 11 cakes of an ifa or flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out under the oak and presented it so he bring this food here and the angel of the lord said unto him take the flesh and the 11 cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so verse 21 and the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the eleven cakes and their rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight so that there is already a manifestation right there now friends if you somebody come and talk to you and you positive challenge and you see fire come out and you see a sign like that that for me that's enough for me i am i am completely completely i am sold you don't need to convince me any more than that so at that point gideon's fate or belief like i said belief starting to kill a little bit because the bible says and verse 22 and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord he then said alas o lord god but because i've seen an angel of the lord face to face so gideon is scared petrified no because there's this fear of seeing an angel and the consequences of seeing an angel all right and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die so that was gideon's fear that because he witnessed and see an angel face of this he was going to die on this spot then we start to build here verse 24. and verse 24 is what many believers begin to do in their journey so let's kind of bring it home here now then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovah shalom so he is giving god a name now lord is peace jehovah shalom and unto this day it is yet an offer of the abyssal right so that testimony of jehovah shalom and the altar that gideon built there is still a testimony to this day according to scripture everybody with me can we church say amen so i want us to now catch what is happening here now so gideon built an altar which building an altar and worshiping is two different things i want us to begin to connect some things here because when you have an altar your purpose of alter is free to do worship not so so the bible says here that gideon built an altar but it doesn't say anything about worship further to which the bible says here now verse 25 and it came to pass the same night so the same day that he build the altar unite god have to come back to him and i wanted to see why god is coming back to him and i pray this will help somebody here tonight and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father had and cut down the groove that is by it so i want us to understand something how hard it is for people to give up certain things so here it was we started back from the beginning israel did evil in the sight of the lord it is because of the doing evil and insight of the lord they are under the media knights they go through seven years of trial seven years of pressure it took them a while to cry loud enough for god to send a prophet to answer and say even though you're crying i want you to catch you even though you're crying you still haven't obeyed my voice because if you obey my voice you would follow me and me only if you obey my voice you would have no other god before me if you obey my voice you would serve no graven image god begins to deal with gideon he begins to say gideon mighty man of allah he begins to speak prophetic words over him or you can say it another way he begins to speak of a future gideon that gideon hasn't met yet gideon's revelation of the world is enough to know that something more than what he's going through should be possible because he knows of the old times but gideon doesn't understand how to get to where he needs to be anybody with me tonight god gives him a sign and he does what i guess most people do let me start to do something for the lord what is it just so he builds an altar in so much that he calls jehovah shalom and to this day it's still one of the seven redemptive names of god but in doing so there's an issue that gideon has to resolve it's not his own just personal issue is the fact that he has now been growing in an environment where the idolatry has not been cast down i want us to catch us so god is saying i see your altar you know i see you start to pray i see you start to read the books i see you're trying to make things right but i need to talk to you about the alter you haven't struck down anybody with me tonight all right i kind of i kind of pushed into your home a little bit now right so anybody who would have talked to gideon at that point could get a testimony the lord came to me i had an experience i tried him i brought certain things to him i saw the fire strike it something came over me i said this has to be jehovah shalom this has to be god is my peace and he missing his war here's my peace i'm building an altar for him of his own choosing gideon didn't turn and say i need to get rid of baal it took god coming to him and say in verse 25 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him and i pray tonight the lord is saying unto you because many of us we have built the right altar so to speak in doing things to change our work change our talk and acknowledge god but if you have any hidden idols this is what this message is for tonight the lord say go get your father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and threw down the altar of bail that thy father had had and listen and cut down the grove in the amplified it says cut down the asirah ashira is actually the grove that they're talking about here was another structure built with wood for the goddess ashira which was considered the wife of veil so i want us to understand the children of israel had gotten so backslidden it was not just baal worship was going on it was baal and the goddess of shira which they called the grove so it was two deities so this is why god say get two bullocks all right let's go further the instruction and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the order place in the ordered place here in the amplified speaks to in an orderly way meaning in the in the right system and you write order the way this thing is supposed to be done and take the second bullock and offer a burn sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down in other words you're making an altar to destroy this altar of bill and making another altar to destroy on top of the wood of ashira on top of the wood of the grove on top of all of the traditions in other words before i could use you more before i could further this revelation before you could go into action you can't just make an altar to me alone you have to destroy completely that thing that had you consumed before anybody with me anybody anybody with me tonight so gideon is called he has chosen he's about to walk into one of the greatest ministries that the earth would have ever seen he doesn't know better because he is following what his fathers would have done can the church say amen so god is saying i'm going to use you but in case you don't know i've given you are giving an instruction people wouldn't like it we'll get to it people will have issue with it but i want you to break down this altar of bill in your family this is not the whole of israel he's dealing with right now come on now this is not the tribe of judah and the tribe of isaka and the tribe of dan and the tribe of god and the tribe of levi he is speaking to one man in a small family in the tribe of maniser god will get to the other tribes he will get to the other houses but right now this is one man hallelujah in his house amongst his family and god is starting to carve his way out just like luther god pulled luther out of the catholic church just he just take one man and start to do a work with him you think there's one man named gideon give him a sign use fire he didn't catch a revelation jehovah shalom and god say yes there's more to it i want you to go and destroy bal i want you to go and destroy ashira i want you to build new altars now listen carefully and i want you to understand now the empowerment of this man i want you to see the struggles he's going through as he's coming into his destiny and i want us for each of us to understand his struggles we may have to do in climbing to our destiny he is called a mighty man of valor but every move he's making is one of timidity caution care keep moving tentatively listen dan gideon verse 27 took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was listen because he feared you have a mighty man of valor and look at the description because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night so we seen a pattern of behavior hiding in your wine press threaten fresh and wheat god god tell you do something and gideon there for fear of his father's household and remain he is now procrastinating god waiting for him to go into action but he is being moved back by fear what does it catch something here so he waited he waited all day all day all day and do any night he do it and let's build let's build and when the men of the city arose early in the morning this is the 20 this is 20 years now behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove called the grove of ashira was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built and they said to one another who had done this thing so you can see now why gideon is operating fearful because the initial response is who did this thing and when they inquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash had done this thing so i wanted to see the building of this this evolution here then the men of the city said unto joash they went to thank you grandfather bring out thy son that he may die you see your backslidden israel was you see why god has had to operate where he he he operates the whole of israel listen this is not the the ten commandment the one no other gods before me no graven images this is foundational commandments gideon did what should have been done a long time ago and these backslidden israelites of the tribe of monastery the best response they could get to tearing down idols is let us kill him you understand what happens in his spiritual realm when in your house you begin to tear the idols oh come on now let's push let's push you understand how the demons get angry when you begin to begin to set your house in order when they begin to set your family in order when you begin to make you write moves holy demons say let's kill him oh come on now somebody help me tonight hallelujah then the men of the teacher said unto george bring out thy son that he may die because he had cast down the altar of bill and because he had cut down the grove that was by it he had just destroyed battle to be cut on the grove too oh he could do that and joe has said unto all that stood against him will he plead for baal will he save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death while it is yet mourning listen to joao's revelation if he be a god let him plead for himself because one had cast down his altar let me read that in the amplified hallelujah but joe i said to all who stood against him if if bale is a god let him defend himself because someone has torn down his water so he said oh you're riling up trying to kill my son olivia plead in for this god well if he's like oh well him he fell he said he can't defend himself so joe has started to get a little courage he never had a courage before he he he son who hide in all the time who have no reputation go and do the bravest thing you ever do in your life enjoy us like he like he looked courage he lost long time come back he said brethren bred you don't i don't want to do it ollie plead in for this idol i'm a son will any either defend yourself no anybody with me i wanted to see the context on as if we'd be there watching his whole thing play out right therefore on that day come on now on that day he called him so josh gave his son a whole new name therefore on that day he called him jerubal saying let ball plead against him because he had thrown down his altar so if you want to know who jerubal is that is gideon next name so he became gideon jerubal himano tierre dumbell anybody with me tonight seems power names let's go then all the media nights verse 33 and all the amalekites and the churn of the east a whole there's a consortium this is a united move here all the media knights if they say some all the media knights and the amalekites and the churn of the east were gathering together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel you remember we talked about the valley of jezreel a couple weeks ago that way hab house was and so this is familiar territory we unfamiliar territory you know the pitch by the valley of jezreel you will remember if you can that jezreel is under the jurisdiction of the tribe of issachar so they are rich they reach manasseh yet they have reached gideon area yet the average has jurisdiction yet but that move closer touch is god and the bible says but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and ibiza was gathered after him so this man who was afraid who now coming into his own he have a little strength now because his name changed already people no longer call him gideon decide to now mix his name because you'll read it later on then jerubal who is gideon so decide to call him the mixing name no daisy man who break down the idol if only i hear about him hear about him today this is a man and he blew his trumpet you have a farmer because that's what he was a farmer not blew a trumpet and he barbara says and ebiza aviaza is a piece of the tribe of manasseh so it's not the whole tribe yet just his immediate family rally around him and if yes i was gathered after him and he sent messengers listen true all manasseh so you're getting the rest of the tribe so again i want you to see how when we talk about a revival start in your own home come on now it air reached all eternal israel it already holds tribe yet he start with his own house and he say our house gonna do something we hear the enemy gathering on that other side we go and do something about it so he blow his trumpet and his family the family of ebiaza which is his is almost like that was his original surname they gathered together and he sent word through the tribe of manasseh to say let's extend this to our tribe if no other tribe going we're not ready to sit down and take licks no more anybody with me tonight if no other tribe ready to fight i don't care how big the enemy is no anybody with me and he sent messengers visited if i threw out all manasseh who also was guarded after him and now listen look at the outward movement and he send messengers unto asha another tribe now we start to bring the other tribes involved and enter zebulun and enter naftali and they came up to meet him so now we have a situation we have four tribes in action the tribe of manasseh the tribe of usher he tried of zebulun and the tribe of naftali right around a man who a short while ago was hiding in a cave trying to do wheat without the enemy seeing him because he had an experience anybody with me tonight and gideon said unto god now this is how i like to see at the same time the fate is building and the character is forming we see the humanity we see the human aspect we see the original native demand still wrestling with his future destiny and gideon said unto god if thou will save israel by my hand as thou has said he go and put god and next us behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor so i fleece it like a little piece from a sheep a little piece of wool it's very it it will absorb water be all i will put a fleece of wall in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it'd be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that god will save israel by mine hand as dao has said so gideon i wanted to see the changing scenario he was one man in a cave talking to the angel of the lord the lord spoke with him here believe he has sure he need a sign situation already changing upon him he now leading an army of four tribes but he's still battling in security there are people who are around him who believe in him they have confidence in him his name has already been changed and identified as jeroboa the man who could cast down bail and he is there wondering lord should i move forward and if you're ready with me give me a sign and it was so verse 38 for he rose up early on the morrow the next day and trust the fleece together in other words grab it and ring the dew out of the fleece so you pick up the wall it's heavy with water he squeezed it out a bowl full of water the earth was dry the fleece alone had water no many of us in this room would say well that would that should be enough saying what more i need to see and gideon so i wanted to understand now the uncertainty and how far this mighty man of valor was from how his thinking was and his condition was he said and gideon verse 39 said unto god left not that in anger be hot against me but i really want to be sure i am ready to go there because that enemy is a lot all right and i won't speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only on the fleece so let's reverse the scenario just in case somebody tricked me just in case it wasn't really real let me get a reverse all right so what i want to see lord he said now be dry only upon the fleece and upon holy ground let there be you in other words wet everything around the fleece and let it freeze stay dry so i want to see if the reverse is also possible and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground verse seven or chapter seven verse one are you with me tonight then jerubal your city name there you name change scripture is clear so identifying his rank his position understanding the authority with which he's moving forward then jeroboam who is gideon and all the people that were with him his four tribes so four tribes are fighting men 32 000 men three two zero zero zero thirty two thousand men then jeroboam who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of herod so that the hosts of the media midianites were on the north side of them by the valley by the hill of morocco in the valley are you with me are you ready naughty drama going on pick up yeah buckle your seat belts let's get ready and the lord said unto gideon and i love this the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into thy hands lest israel vaughn themselves against me saying my own hands had saved me in the amplifier they say my own power had saved me and the lord struck here with me he said listen plenty times god has to strip people away from us strict people away from you because if you have too much people in your court you can claim you did it oh god somebody helped me tonight many times we're looking for people to support us we want friends to support us we want family to support us we want our soul satan and our network and and the people are leaning on and god is looking at gideon surrounded by 32 000 men and say you have too much people in your circle you have too many people around you in so much that you could take credit for what i'm about to do and i want you to catch a picture i don't want you to take credit i don't want man to take credit i want to get holy credit i want us to catch this tonight so sometimes you wonder wonder why god allow people to walk away from you because i realize the more people you have around you the less peace it have for god can i say that one more time the more people it have around you the less space you have for god the less room it has for god to operate and god is looking for plenty of room because he wanted to i wanted to catch this no matter how bad things get with godzilla you see when god ready to start to do war on behalf of his children god doing war good when are you ready to fight for your battles he's fighting the battles completely he's not fighting a button on a in a half pass that way he's gonna fight it for real all right so he said now therefore this is verse three go to proclaim in the heirs of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and their return of the people 20 and thousand and they remain ten thousand listen friends when you process that for a minute i seriously imagine brother thompson you they're going to go with a war you have thirty two thousand soldiers you really don't know what they had to know you there ready for war but adjacent 32 000 men with you and you thinking that all these 32 000 ready to pop off they're ready to fight they're ready at the drop of a hat they're ready to go to war and when you ask them ought to be 32 000 of all you anybody scared and 22 000 say are you already scared of them that's scary totally don't you want people who in your core two not scared don't you want to go to war and go into a war or enter a battle with people who already have your back because if you have people who scared with you the moment and get too much pressure they turn around and leave you know anybody with me tonight and this is what god didn't want here let's build right and the lord said unto gideon the people are here too many so 22 000 go on they're scared they want to fight their freight battle they've afraid walk it's ten thousand you say this is still too much you lost into gideon uh the people are yet too many bring them down until the water and i will try them for thee there now i love this this is the first time god do in the interviews because you see i'm not trying them for me you know i'm trying them for v in other words i am helping pick the team that go into this war i go and do the interview i will try them in the ambition test them for thee there and it shall be that whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i see unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so god is saying when i finish this test whoever tell you go in they're going so it's not your call it's not your choice you're not picking anybody who i say go in go in who i say i'm not going did not go in so he brought down the people verse five so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon everyone that lapid of the water with his tongue as a dog lapit him shall thou set by himself likewise everyone that bow it down upon his knees to drink so those that's how you're dividing them and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were 300 men but all of the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water now this here is a real serious scripture and a lot of people theologians have fought on this particular verse and i will bring some of the arguments and then i'll show you how the prophet cleared this answer up and why we thank god for the prophet now if you go down to a river to drink water no matter what nobody i i have never seen a human being just bury their head in water to drink nobody does that so he lapping whether you were lapping with your hand because he said lap with your hand and on your knee it is it is almost expected that in both scenarios people would have to use their hand to help drink because men don't have tongues like dogs so to understand this you have to understand how a dog actually drinks water the tongue of a dog is different from the tongue of a human the dog would curve his stronger city and he can actually lift water out himself with your stone you know you can do that so the lapping is not really a physiological weapon it's a principle god was having here and where the brahmana was pushing further to say that god was watching the me in this case god was actually doing he was weaving out the idolatry in the heart of the people so those who were kneeling he was actually going against the idolatry so the first group of people was people who were afraid who went those who left he was pulling the people who had i guess ease of idolatry out but at the same time those that were lapping when you really understand a concept of lapping in this context it also means people who i've heard some people present that they were super alert and it was elite soldiers and they were super vigilant super vigilance doesn't fit the context of this narrative because god was fighting in this whole teaching to show how he can take nothing and make it something i want this to get just carefully so god is telling gideon i don't want man to take credit too much people with many people will say oh they win it if this was a team of navy seals then he could say well we really are the best man i know that why we win i want you to catch this so it's not that god was trying to float along 300 elite soldiers the 300 men who were lapping like dogs when you you ever watch a dog a dog lapping literally goes all in in her so the alertness here is in question in the teaching of people being super alert these 300 was lapping was people who was willing to almost get on into it and go and drink and they really care what's going on around them in other words god was saying you see the three hundred most unlikely people who have no idolatry and they had died in chile should i go and choose because i want all the glory from this anybody with me we're pushing we're pushing all right and the number for six of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water and the lord told them to give you by the 300 men that lacked will i save you and deliver the media knights into thine hand and let all the other people go every man into his place all right so we building so the people took rituals food in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of million was beneath him in the valley let's build first nine and it came to pass the same night so god is beginning to sort of move in a piece here right the same night that he loads it unto him arise get thee down so he's speaking directly to gideon he won't start yet he battles start yet gideon jerubal arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand and to show that gideon was still coming onto his own listen to the next voice when i saw this i was like wait boy he lost 70 gideon but if thou fear to go down go down with purer thy servant dumb dude in other words if you're scared to go by yourself hallelujah in in in the amplified it says it clearly but if you're afraid to go down by yourself go with pure your servant don't you decamp all right and thou shalt hear what they see and afterwards shall die hands be strengthened to go down unto the host now if this was a mighty man of allah his scripture should say and gideon went on by himself next words then when he done with pure or his servant the only reason he went with europe because he's frightening because god said before he said if you're scared carry this man with you so you have a little company then he went down with pure his servant onto the outside of the army that were in the house and listen and the media knights and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude that their camels were without number i wanted to get this how much people were talking about and their cameras were without them as the sand by the sea side for multitude i wanted to see the picture of this later on we'll hear how much it was and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dreamer to his fellow so i wanted to see the drama here gideon sneaked down by the camp with his servant they are the edge of the enemy camp of a multitude they are defense nobody's seeing them and they they are listening no are talking about the transformation of a man now and there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said so this is the bible doesn't say if it's a media night tell a talking another media night or the midnight talking to anna malachite or a malachi talking to a child of the east it just says two fellows from the camp it have millionaires there it have america's attachments two of them having this conversation and one fellow said unto the other and told them a dream and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of medium and came under a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it and he turned layer along so one fell again dream he see a piece of bread a cake of barley bread tumble down into the house come upon a tent strike the tent you ten fall down and he there wondering what it means his partner verse 14 and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else he said the interpretation save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for enter his hand had god the level median and all used so here it is god brings in the entire spot that he is hearing the enemy talking among themselves getting a dream and interpreting the dream that he wins and you remember he said earlier that gideon built an altar but there was no mention of worship that after you build the altar goal of still cleaning up so god is taking him through a process as well listen to verse 13 verse 15. first time and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped the first time he hear wishing so in other words he had to go through the angel coming fire on his sacrifice he had to go through one fleece as a sign go to the next place as i say go through all of this and tell god to lead him to hear one man testify to him forgive you unto worship and worship and returned into the horse of israel and said arise so now his confidence no he finally i can get his confirmation you waiting on i wanted to see this picture of this man who rises to mighty man of allah he's not there yet he's rising you know he gained more confidence right a rise where the lord had delivered into your hand the whole submedian so now he you're ready to share his excitement about this though right so now it's it's as if a shift takes place he divided the 300 men into three companies 100 100 100. so battle formations done right and he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pictures and lambs within the pictures and he said to them look on me and do likewise so the way this has been expressed is it's not like it's an elite team of soldiers who know exactly what they're doing and and they can operate on their own this is he didn't say listen just follow my lead so this comes across as a team of guys who really not ready to train in in this thing right look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall you do so let's just follow me when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon so gideon and the hundred men that were with him so it's it's three companies hundred hundred hundred so gideon there's a hundred men so getting the hundred men away with him came onto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch all right so the middle watch the watches change under the romans to four watches but here in judges there were only three watches between 6 p.m to 6 a.m with three watches 6 p.m to 10 p.m 10 p.m to 2 a.m 2 a.m to 6 a.m so the so the first watch was 6 00 p.m to 10 p.m so the beginning of the middle watch was around 10 pm at night so god is so good he can get any time he do this thing all right and if you're wondering how specific it is came onto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch so it's not just what i saying just between 10 and 2 you know but it's here around 10 p.m that's the exact time this attack took place and they had but newly set the watch so it's like 1001 1002 three just after they watch just after they saw let's take their place and they blew their trumpets and braved the pictures that were in their hands and the three companies of a hundred men each blew their trumpets and break the pictures and held the lambs in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with all and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon and they stood every man in his place round about the camp so it is clear here that they have nothing to do with it they stood in their place they didn't move and all the hosts this piece of scripture here i was studying and i started to laugh listen to the description the bible says and all he was run first thing they did and cried second thing to death and fled is the first time you see was ran and fled in the same sentence these 300 men surround the camp blowing their horns hitting their vessels and the baby says all the hosts not some all the others ran and when you see the picture people get up and they're running i don't know at what point they start to cry and cried and then fled run cry fled and the 300 blew the trumpets and the lord set every man's sword against his fellow so they the midianites the amalekites and the children of the east began to cloud one another gideon's men have nothing to do with it at this point said every man's sword against his fellow even threw out all the hosts and the horse fled to bachelor in zara rat and to the border of amel meloha onto taba now i checked this geographically all right if you check this they say this is about 10 miles so these fellas run in fact they fled you know there's a run for 10 minutes a 10 mile run it takes you between about 45 minutes that or if you're physically fit to run that denfel has run non-stop for about an hour to get away from those 300 men there you see when god started to do something how powerful it is anybody with me tonight and listen now listen to notice since that change with gideon when he heard that dream and he began to take action that was a turning point for him from this point on there's no there's no questioning the authority he has now stepped into his own and the men of israel guarded themselves together out of naftali out of asha and out of manasser and pursued after the media knights so now we begin to build here and gideon so gideon now in ripping form so they're running and he'd say now we're going after them now god is so good dubai and gideon sent messengers throughout all monk ephraim so ephraim is his brother tribe they didn't know what's going on but he said word ephraim their land is on a mountain their mountain connects to the sea so he send messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters onto bed burra and jordan in other words we chasing them i want you to cut them off by the water so ephraim who didn't know what going on suddenly pick up their weapons and they headed down to the jordan river running off the mountains to cut off the medianites anybody with me then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters onto bedbury and jordan and they took two princes of the midianites so they chased these men to catch down two princes of the medianites oreb and zebra and they slew aurep upon the rock of orb so whoever rocky name they go and find the rock and he sees his rock and they threw him on the rock that had his name and zeb they slew at the wine press of zebu you wine press whoever they want to call up they'll sue him there too and they pursued million and brought the heads of orb and zee to gideon on the other side of jordan could he take a little more we cannot drive in a car stop now kind of finished bringing the car home right and the man of ephraim now this is where i find it interesting and the man of ephraim said to him why has those served us does in other words why i treat her so that dog cut us that don't call us us not in other words why you went to war and here tell us wendell went is to fight with the media knights all the time ephraim there with everybody else backside all did not try doing anything now they see what happened they're jumping up saying we're really fighting now too and the man of ephraim said unto him why has dogs saved us thus that thou cut us us not here call us when they went just to fight with the minionites and they did chide with him sharply that would child which means quarrel vehemently so they were so angry that gideon rallied the other tribe and didn't invite the tribe of ephraim to join this fight because now now they're feeling good that they have the enemy on the run you see you should have called us earlier why why the intelligence having a revival why didn't tell us it was it was it was enemy cleaning time we cannot join the fight late you should have called us before look at the wisdom of gideon and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you he said it's not the gleaving of the graves of ephraim better than the vintage of abhieza you don't know what he said sweet talk the brothers from ephraim he said it's not the green and the gleaming it's translated as the leftovers so in the amplified they say it's not the leftovers of the grapes of your tribe better than the entire harvest of my tribe so he said i wouldn't call a big mighty tribe like you when he's a little is a small child i got the power to call this big tribe to come and help us god and listen listen gideon positioning god had delivered into your hands so gideon no because you remember it was ephraim who cut them off and grabbed the two princes so gideon used a national he said god delivered into your hands he prince of media and aurora benzema if you catch it the two of them it wasn't me so don't go don't get vectored me when without you we couldn't win this thing what was i able to do in comparison of you so here leaving some wisdom this is not this is no i want to pay the pitch you know this is no longer the gideon of chapter six and i'm chapter seven this is now a gideon who is now stepping into such a level of operation that although ephraim upset with his administration he's able to bring them in line and say but look at the situation my tribe is a small child you're a big tribe i've got the power to call you further to that the fact is when we was chasing them we couldn't get them it was you who catch them so and look what the bible said then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that what if he didn't say the wrong thing but he said the right thing you see how god has just been dropping these things to kind of just show us behavior conduct wisdom order and listen and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the 300 men that were with him and i love this scripture faint yet pursuing them i love that i love that i love that in the amplified so gideon came to the jordan and crossed over the river he and the 300 men who were with him exhausted yet pursuing the enemy and that's how i feel tonight something you feel exhausted but you're not giving up faint then brothers tired they're wary but they say we have to finish this fight faint but they're not giving up tired but they're not giving up they run a long time but they're not giving up they know the enemy has been routed we have the enemy on the ropes we have the enemy running we can't afford to stop now because we could finish this thing tonight we can finish this battle now you see the context so i want you to see the whole character how his character has formed this is not a given of six or seven now so gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the 300 men that were with him faint yet pursuing them tired but they're not giving up and he said unto the men of sokkat soccer is in the land of god and sukkot is similar to this area at that time would have been in a hall by the savannah have all them food hut singh where people go and buy food by the savannah and you have different areas in the country ever said the huts of food so this sukkat at that time would have been like an area with a set of huts of food in in during under the jerusalem of the tribe of god he said give i pray you loaves so he's telling them give me some bread onto the people that follow me the 300 men are following me for they be faint retired we hungry we chasing the enemy this enemy has been oppressing us for a long time and i am pursuing after i want you to catch this the prince is already there remember the princess or rib and zeb then fellas done dead but they're going after the kings he then said i want everybody so you say i pray thee for they be feeling i am pursuing after zebra and salmonella kings of millions we want the kings we're going after the kings of the media knights now and the princes of sukkot said at the hands of zebra and zamunda now in dine hand that we should give bread onto dynami so the men in sukkot saying you have no evidence there's no evidence that you could win that's what they say to him and are they in your hands we have no proof in other words what if you lose what if we give you bread and you get licks the kings of media will come and kill us so go your way no food for you and gideon said therefore when the lord had delivered zebra and zamunda into my hands then i will tear your flesh with the torns of the wilderness and with briars you see that then he went up then so gideon is moving he's not stopping i want you to catch this it was a lesson on finishing the mission go take a farmer and put in a mission over here he ain't getting food but he has stopped him yesterday hello god i need food look what they tell me a discourage you know we're fighting all night you know we chase and all night we need to eat and and then and the enemy running and a car find food then fellas say no food for you he's still moving on and he went up against the pen you will samuel you'll find it in genesis that didn't seem much pernier this was the area where jacob wrestled with the angel so he's moving now he's moving and it's a bear in mind there's no king israel is divided but god is having it in such a way that he is moving through territories of the different tribes and he went up against the penul and spake unto them likewise and a man of penul answered him as the men of sukkot had answered him so the men there too so back satan they afraid to give gideon food because they don't know are believe that ginogan win this battle i want this to get just now let's go and he speak also bear in mind i want you to see the language of gideon now there's no fear there's no hesitation there's no wandering and he speak unto them he said when i come again in peace i would break down this tower so he just listened tricks he making statements he's only war part now now zebra and zamunda we're almost done zebra and zamuna were in kakoa and they host with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for their fell and hundred and twenty thousand men that judy saw well they see that oliver knew what the horse was that was in that in that army so in other words it was a hundred and thirty-five thousand molecular dramats it was 135 000 soldiers when gideon's three hundred men had attacked oh look at that a hundred and thirty-five thousand was the army that was there against three hundred hallelujah and god had it that's a hundred and twenty thousand of them killed to kill one another that itself is a mind-boggling thing a hundred and twenty thousand fell by the sword and running from gideon and his men fifteen thousand left and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tens verse eleven on the east of noba and jorge so gideon now sneaking he's not a military he's not moving like navy seals all right so now we we're at verse 11 and the and smoothie holds for the horse was secure in the amplified it says when the camp was unsuspecting so notice this is the first time we see an actual attack again of gideon he has been chasing all along but now he got into full-scale war he gone into attack mode this is very different from his first encounter with a much bigger army this is now gideon now operating in the anointing of mighty manavalo his first encounter was experience chess proof this way just how we do it but now he in total attack mode and when zebra and zamuna fled so it's 15 000 men he attacked when zebra and zamunda fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of media zebra and zamuna and the bible said and discomforted all the hosts in the amplified it said terrify the entire army how does a man go from hiding in the cave to terrifying our whole army and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up and uh and i love this part it's just the way god unfolds it and he caught verse 14 a young man of the men of sukkot do you remember when he passed and they said no food for you and then he passed your pen here and he said no are you tell them i will come back let me go back to that verse just to make sure we see the context and gideon said this is eight verse seven therefore when the land had delivered when the lord had delivered zebra and zul dalmun into my hand then i will tear your flesh with the torn of the wilderness and with briars back to verse 14 and quote a young man of the men of sukkot and inquired of him and he described unto him the princes of sukkot in the amplified it says it like this he captured a young man and questioned it and the young man wrote down for him the names of the leaders of the sukkot and its elders 77 men even three score and 17 men we see in the king james right and the bible says and he came unto the men of sukit and said behold zebra and salmonella in other words look the kings i went after with whom you did upgrade me saying at the hands of zebra and zamunda now in nine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are wary listen if you ever was trying to find a scripture when men get relics like actual licks this is not like kill lick this is licks like bell clicks and he took the elders of the city and he tore under the weatherless and bright and with them he taught the men of sukkot in the in the amplified he took the allies and and and with them he punished the men of sukkot so he basically make the men stand up and give them licks like take a belt and he get on it licks for the disrespect when he was riding through and he was faint and he was tired and he wanted something to eat and he beat down verse 17 the tower of penuel and saw the man of the city then he said unto zebra and zamunda what manner of men were they whom he slew a tabo tabor was a mountain now you remember that these israelites were hiding in caves and hiding in the hills and hiding from them so gideon at that point was also locked up in him was his own pain his own tragedy his own story his own expertise witness that would have led him to be hiding doing his his whole threshing he said what manner of men were they whom you sue and they answered as thou art in other words he was asking them there was some men you killed on a certain mountain called tabo how did they look and they answered as thou art in other words they look like you so were they each one resembled the children of a king so there's a lot being said here because these kings were watching gideon and they were saying they resembled children of a king like you so they were looking at gideon's countenance this man who early on say a list of my family list house lowest tribe they were saying they look like a son of a king the way you look like the son of a king you see that there oh his whole countenance is all manner these kings these were two kings talking to gideon recognizing they see in kingship they seen an anointing upon gideon and seeing the men who we kill they actually look like you two you know you look like royalty but let's go on as though i saw were they each more resemble the children of the king and he said they were my children all right so in the amplified they were my brothers even the sons of my mother so it means gideon he was actually gideon's own brothers these two kings had killed his own brothers as the lord lived if he had saved them alive in other words if you had let my own brothers live i would not slay you and he said unto jesus his firstborn so there's the first time we hear gideon had a child his first born jitter a little boy was actually with him as part of that unit that was chasing these kings and he said unto jesus his firstborn up and slay them but the youth just like his father usually drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth then zebra and zamuna said rise down and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength so he's saying this little boy calculus and the bible said i'm hiding a rose and slow zebra and zalmuna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks let's try to quickly close off here then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son's son also for thou has delivered us from the hand of medium and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you you see how powerful that was and how honestly the context of this and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you and he would give me every man the earrings of his prey for their golden earrings because they were ishmaelites children of the east and the answer we will willingly give them and they spread our garment and their cast he was collecting all his jewelry there every man the earrings of his prey and the weight of the golden earring that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and colors and purple arraignment that was on the kings of median and beside the chains they were about the cameras next and gideon made an effort you remember the e4 when david went through the e4 when they took his his family with a a robe that the priest would use a role that is a garment that a magistrate will use a robe a judge will use a robot leader will use thereof and put it in a city even an opera and all israel when fiddler are warring after it so in other words soon they see a next thing to to admire they went after it soon they said next idol and that was his cycle in the book of judges which thing became a snare on to gideon to his house thus medion was subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more so did the media night this was the end of the the militarized inscription after this there's no significant if any mention of the media night after this gideon destroyed them completely and the country was in quietness 40 years in the days of gideon and jeroboam the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word and he's going to close off with one quote whereby branham said here god can't use anything that's afraid you know in the message towards the father it will satisfy us you know gideon had to send them all back that was scared and if you're afraid to testify of your healing before it comes god can't use you if you're afraid to tell the people you've received the holy ghost don't worry i doubt whether you ever got it or not see god wants heroes he wants something that's brave god wants someone that'll stand up and talk i'm not scared to tell your boss or anyone else jesus christ the son of god has saved me from a life of sin so i just want to kneel down friends that god was fighting through that period and we'd see what god will do with other teachings through the judges and stuff like that but god was fighting not just to take his children out of the oppression that when they were in by the media nights but we saw how he fought to cast down bail and to cast down ashira and to restore the altar and we see and i think it's a powerful teaching friends how gideon one man in his house could influence his house then influence his tribe then extend to other tribes even the tribe of ephraim who in a whole next area but they get caught up in calling this revival that started with one man who had an experience with god that god had to show him that yes you have to build an altar unto me yes you have to worship me but yes you need to cut down everything that you should not be doing and the prophecy or the command that god placed above your life such as mighty man or valor or overcomer or or bride or predestinated unto adoption it may not look as what it should be yet but it will happen because that's how god operates let us bow our heads to our word of prayer or heavenly father the teaching tonight lord from the book of judges on gideon and how you use them so mightily lord someone who didn't know who he was but rose to the challenge and was able to be a mighty testimony lord i was able to row the enemy even the media knights lord in his day and lord how you father justified him through scripture that he is counted and numbered in hebrews 11 lord how lord paul would say if time would only tell i'll speak of so many others who also had a powerful testimony so lord may you touch your people tonight and may you give them the courage to live up to this word declaration that you have spoken over our lives of who we are to be a lord a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people lord rich and time past with other people but but now we are people and we come from different backgrounds from different families from different walks of life and we find ourselves father hiding in caves lord to get away from different situations as gideon was hiding in a cave and we try our best to build an altar and to do our worship and to put you first but give us the strength to destroy the hidden works of darkness give us the strength to shut down the enemy completely and lord give us the faith and the courage to take your word as real to us lord and lord we see how hesitant he didn't want to even believe lord and to see through scripture lord see even when jesus rose from the dead oh thomas wanted to to touch to experience if this thing was even real and he said blessed that day that that believe without having to see so father may you give our faith to rise to rise to the occasion lord that this word is real and the same way you operated for your children through the ages and raised people up out of their condition to embrace their spiritual destiny we too are being challenged tonight to raise to our calling our high calling even christ you the hope of glory may you bless your children may you strengthen your people may you give us courage and confidence to keep pressing the battle and father may we keep the enemy on the run lord one of the most powerful scriptures they were faint but they were still pursuing they were tired but they were not giving up give us the strength lord lord to keep going even though we may be tired even though we may be faint even though we may be wary and even if things don't work out when they act of food and didn't get food they step still kept going because the mission had to be completed lord we want to complete the mission and like paul they say i've run my course i've finished the race i've kept the faith and a crown is waiting for me may you bless your people may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the prayer meeting on friday and may you bring us back at the appointed time in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord richly bless you service continues tomorrow night at 8 00 pm our live stream and friday prem meeting at 8 pm may the lord bless you mighty church mighty men of allah mighty sisters of allah keep the faith lift your
