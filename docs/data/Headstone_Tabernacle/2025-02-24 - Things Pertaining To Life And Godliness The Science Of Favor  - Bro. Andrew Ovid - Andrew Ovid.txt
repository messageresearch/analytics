first session for 2025 the first session of things pertaining to life and to Godliness and today we have a special topic um if it is that you have your Bibles close by it will be really fantastic um so that we'll be able to go through some scripture and I have a topic for you today which is the science of favor right it's a science of favor right and throughout Bible we see the use of the word grace and we see the use of the word favor and we all are benefactors of God's grace amen so um I just want to read a couple scriptures right that speaks to favor and then we're going to dive into the topic because we want that you're able to see how this is going to be able to work for you and how biblically in the past that it has been um beneficial for God's people um amen all right so I'm going to read from I'm going to read from Exodus 3 chapter 20 all right so Exodus 3 T chapter 20 and this is when God was speaking to Moses in the buron bush and he said and I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go and I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and of her that sourth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and rment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and he shall spoil the Egyptians amen I also want to read from Exodus 12 verse 35 Exodus 12:35 and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and rment and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the the Egyptians amen and um in one of the other sessions I would have read in Deuteronomy 8 and I'm just going to read Deuteronomy 8 verse 18 to 20 and in Deuteronomy 8: 18 and this whole passage about Deuteronomy 8 is actually a warning from the Lord about don't forget him don't forget who would have brought you out of Egypt so it's it speaks to this passage and it's also a warning for us right so he says but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God this is Verse 18 for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto thy Fathers as it is this day and it shall be if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish as the Nations which the Lord Lord destroy it before your face so shall he perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen so um just to lay a little background God told Moses that he will give his people favor in the sight of the people and he showed later down where that favor was fulfilled and in Deuteronomy he is saying don't forget me and it's a warning normally I would say talk about warning um like against poverty but in the Bible there's warnings against wealth there's warnings against poverty as well right so this is one not to forget the Lord right because he would have been able to give the people that favor right and throughout the Bible we see this word being used so Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord right Jacob f um found Grace there was actually a scripture where lot was speaking to the to the angels to say thy servant has found Grace in thy sight and this is why I would have been saved right so there's quite a lot of scriptures that pertain onto favor and to Grace and we want to be able to see how we could apply that to our lives so hence my topic being the science of favor all right and in our workplace and I'll will use the phrase workplace and Marketplace interchangeably but in our workplace there's a saying and um there's a saying that a percentage of your success would be the skill it would be the skill set right that's a percentage and there's a even greater percentage which we call spiritual intelligence and it and bundle in there we will talk about about emotional intelligence we will talk about different factors of your life we will talk about mindset and like your attitude and so on and just to show in a normal reference if everybody were to get five subjects or if we were to qualify with the same passes or the same doctorate you would never see everybody operating on the same level right they would never get jobs pertaining to the same exact level and that is also Testament to the fact that a percentage of it is the skill set a percentage of it in the skill set but a a greater percentage would be emotional intelligence spiritual intelligence and basically the favor that are lines that works for that particular person so sometimes it actually works out in in quite different ways from how it is that we see it so let me just get to my notes Here all right so so we're going to talk about why favor matters and why does it matter to us right and one of the reasons is because favor accelerates success favor is something that would that would accelerate success so in the Bible we see where it is that favor would have been able to help to defy the odds and when I say defy the odds I mean when the situation is least likely it's least likely that we should win then we are able to get the Victory and in the Bible we see all the situations with regards to even um like Gideon and the 300 men with regards to David and so on where it is that there was the least the least likelihood of victory but we've been able to win because of God's favor on our life right there's also instances where we were able to how to say it jump the queue right get ahead of of others vying for the same um like position and I'm going to talk about it in scripture just now there's also some who have been chosen for promotion so they have been given rules that they didn't have the qualification for because they have had favor right and we want to talk about God's plan especially when it is that there's there's trying times and troubling times God plan has involved positioning key persons into key positions of significance of influence and of leadership and from these positions God was able to have his People Protected he was able to disrupt the enemy plans and he was able to influence the ations for his people's benefit amen so we're going to talk about we're going to talk about some stuff because we want you to let your light shine so that you'll be able to influence and then you'll be able to lead persons to Christ by also that great favor and that influence which you would be grateful for all right so we're going to talk about Joseph the story of Joseph and there's one thing that I want to point out of note is in the Bible anytime that somebody has been given favor there has been persons [Music] who have had hate towards that favor and it's also a sign for us right that when we see that or when we see hate that that is also potentially a sign of God's favor right because because the world is built in such a way that nobody is just going to like you being able to get ahead and you being and you being able to to prosper and you being successful it's just it's just a natural law of life but in the business world we say we say that the haters are the ones that actually Elevate you so we actually look forward more more to the haters because they are the ones that will push you into position and in the Bible if it is that we look at it so for example just starting with the with the story of Joseph Joseph was favored by his father and he got this special rainbow coat right and then he got these dreams that were revealed to him the Bible said that his brothers hated him for his words and for his dream so the hate of his brothers was actually what propelled them to be able to push him out amen so sometimes we have to look forward to the hate but sometimes we want to be so nice we want we want all the persons to like us okay so um now we also see where in poyer's house he was able to see the favor of God on Joseph's life because everything that is hand t touch would have prospered amen so there was a there was a there's a part in scripture where it said that potifa left everything to Joseph for him to manage because everything had prospered so much potifa probably didn't even know how to track the prosperity within his own home so Joseph managed and it had a point that it said that that all that he knew is that everything was increasing and everything was working out fine because Joseph was in that particular position all right now I want to jump to one of my favorites here so I'm going to go to Genesis 39:21 just to read this other one because we're dealing with Joseph here so Genesis 39 verse 21 and it says but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of he was the doer of it and The Keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper ER amen so that's just to show you that one is that God could bless you and give you favor in every possible situation Joseph was where we would call it the bottom of the barrel he was in prison but God gave him favor with the keeper of the prison right who was able to to give him the keys and this is just it God's favor and you know we would rant and say how life is not fair right but favor favor from God is actually not fair because Joseph may not have been the longest person in the prison to get this title he would have been able to be there and got favor from The Keeper of the prison to be positioned there amen so you can prosper in every situation and even in prison and we're going to talk about some other situations here in the Bible but I just want to say that God informs the way that others see you so not just that God States when he finds favor with you but God informs key people to be able to see what it is that others can't see and everybody may not have the ability to see what it is that others can't see but the key people God has has given them the gift to be able to spot and to be able to give favor for your benefit amen so in the case of Joseph we had Joseph moving from the prison to the palace and that actually happened in one day right Joseph had a very Swift promotion to the Head we have in the case in the Bible in the story of Esther where Esther moved from powerless to powerful also in one day right and that story of Esther there's there's actually multiple places where it is that she would have been shown favor because beauty is in the eye of of the of the beholder right so first of all Esther would have found favor for being able for looking the way that she looked in the eyes of the King right so that was the first form of favor but then she was able to walk into walk into the chamber where it is that it wasn't allowed and influence the situation right we had in the case of Nehemiah where it is that one one conversation was able to give him the permission and the provision to be able to build the wall right and the time the position to be able to build the wall right we also have one that we very familiar with in the case of Daniel Daniel Danel who was an outsider right he was an outsider but he found favor with with King Darius and King Darius would have told him that he find he sees an excellent spirit in him in Daniel and he wanted to position him to his his top right hand position a counselor a right-and person and so on and this is exactly where the haters would have Comm into play right so they would have come up with their scheme to be able to strategize to get the Lions then as a punishment because Daniel didn't worship the same gods that they had Daniel was an outsider and they found that it was unfair that Daniel came into the situation and was able to find favor in the sight of the king amen so yes I want to say that favor is not fair but these are things that God has put into place from the dawn of time because he wants to be able to to to let his people have the influence and to be able to carry about his work and fulfill his Covenant amen so we're going to talk about key people a little bit right because sometimes we would try to please everyone and sometimes we may not understand how favor works and and everyone doesn't have like the ability or or the resources to even support favor so who supports favor it's the key people and the reason that we say key people is because key people have keys right key people have keys right and sometimes we might pay attention to the to the opinion of people who don't have keys right and the reason that I'm saying this and I know that this might this might hurt some persons but everybody in the context and the scheme of things don't matter in terms of their views and their likes and their dislikes right so sometimes you might be going around your Merry way and somebody has a a position or a point or like a perspective and they may not be in a position to help you move towards your purpose with God but still we would take their we would take their information to heart and we would try to try to strategize our life based on that information when that may not be the best for us so I like to call it we like to get validated from somebody who who is who is an invalid right and an invalid is somebody who doesn't do anything somebody who cannot do anything so somehow sometimes we'd like to take a lot of advice from the persons who don't know what it is that they're talking about they have not been in the position before they are not empowered they don't have keys to be able to move you from one place to the next but somehow we find their word valuable and I'm just making the point to say if you don't have the keys then why should your like or your dislike matter and most people would focus on proving themselves to somebody and tailoring their perspective to somebody just so that they could get a like when that does not help instead of focusing on proving yourself you should focus on improving yourself amen so when God says that he opens doors no man can shut it's because he has designed favor the science of favor that no man can stop right which means again that the key informed persons who could open the doors for you there's nobody that could that could influence or impact their their decision especially the ones who don't have keys so I'm going to just go into this a little bit right because we going to going to just differentiate who are key people and maybe you might be able to spot them in your life or around or around the workplace or around the marketplace but it just means that if God has given you the favor you have to be able to expect that hate is going to come from somewhere that distraction is going to come from somewhere and we can't pay attention to everybody's opinions and so on so key key people one we have The Gatekeepers right so The Gatekeepers are the persons who actually are responsible for let's just say like the invite or they allow messages to pass through to certain persons so for example we would have um I see it in my particular business if it is that I go into a company you might have the frest person so if I ask can I speak to the manager right or can I do something or um like I'm doing a marketing promotion I'm doing something like that my ability to be able to get past the gatekeeper is also a position of favor right because that person has some say in where do I go next right the person behind the gatekeeper May normally be uh um like decision makers so for example in the Bible the Kings would have had the that ability to say yes to say no to sign a check to be able to give you certain permissions and so on so those are those are decision makers decision makers you might have them in your Marketplace you might have them in the workplace where it is that they actually have an influence on where things go next which brings me to the next one the next key person that we have we have what we call the influencers and I'm using this particular phrase but in the Bible all the kings had prophets they had wise men they had consultants and there's scriptures in the Bible that speak about um going to war if it is that you have to go to war it's done under under advice it's done under consultancy it's done under um it's not a viy VI decision and I'm just going to go to war right it's sound Council that you're looking for right so it does have um like the influence ERS and the council and the wise men who are able to position and say to the king and decision makers all right this is somebody or this is a good person or this is somebody who will be able to to accelerate the move or to be able to do those things right so I just want to touch a couple scriptures and Proverbs that speaks to the position of favor but that would have covered what key people would look like in your particular environment so we have The Gatekeepers we have decision makers we also have influencers right and I'm saying that because we we do have a society where it is that again we try to get validated especially by sometimes most times by friends and family and they may not again they may not have the keys to be able to help you to move from one place to the next and in fact there's something that I say very very frequently if your friends and family could have moved you to where it is that you needed to be maybe you would have been there already just maybe you would have been there already so where you need to be able to move from one place to the next obviously it's going to be outside of your your immediate circle which means that maybe the validation that you're seeking for they may not be able to help you with some of that right so Proverbs 22:1 it says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and love in favor rather than silver and gold this is speaking to favor Proverbs 11:22 it says he that diligently seeketh good procureth favor but he that seeketh Mischief it shall come to him Proverbs 8:35 and this is speaking onto wisdom it says for who so findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favor of the Lord amen all right so we're going to talk about a few of the situations and I'm going to go back to the story of Moses where in that story God chose to continually Harden the heart of pharaoh and in this position pharaoh became how to say it a hater right Pharaoh became the hater and we even see this particular war and and sometimes it becomes a competition right so when the rod went down and it turns turned into serpent Pharaoh would have gotten his people to do the same thing and in fact they would have gone Toe to Toe for about three rounds so it's quite quite funny when it is is that they would have brought the the plight of the frogs right they would have brought the plight of the frogs and the Bible says that Pharaoh's people went and did their enchantments and did the same thing and it's so funny sometimes how people compete and they hate to their own death detriment so imagine that you live in Egypt and Moses came and turned the water into blood and you come to do the same thing to your own water so you turn some more water into blood so Moses came and brought um and brought frogs and you came and bring some more frogs so the whole place was was then like Sesame Street after that so sometimes we would do things and this is this is why this is why when God gives favor to somebody and somebody's fulfilling their own purpose even if it is that you do have let's just say skills that could compare you cannot compare because that type of competition is just not of God he wouldn't allow it so because because God gave things to everybody but he didn't give them every single thing so everybody is unique to the position that we need people we need we need other persons right we need other persons right and there's a saying that no one man um like it's like a island well no one person could do everything that they need right but through God's grace we could find favor and we could see exactly how we could fulfill our purpose so in the story of Joseph we saw exactly how the brother's hate would have droven him into um into Egypt and we we saw how God's favor would have been able to keep Joseph and to position him to where it is that um that you want to do also a good point of note is that Joseph would have asked the butler to I'm I'm like remember him right now if the Butler had remembered Joseph at that point in time Joseph would have been on a taxi back to back to home which means that he would not have been able to fulfill his Destiny of moving from prison into Power amen so this is just how God designs his program right we saw in the case of Daniel where where King Darius would have found favor would have found favor in Daniel and say I see an excellent spirit in you and Daniel being an um somebody from like a Outsider he's a he's let just say um let just say like an I'm like an immigrant and so on and but because of the way that he worked Darius could have said I see an excellent Spirit In You and I want to promote you to this particular position where Daniel's colleagues would have found that to be unfair and begin to build up the amount of hate that they quickly devised their plan they quickly devised their plan and those those guys know their stuff right because they would have been able to butter up the king and say your majesty you are great you are the best you are whatever that it is to be able to bring that plan about but what did God do God was able to position it that that would have been able to elevate him and and the King was able to say let those same persons who would have accused Daniel put them into the lions then instead amen right so I want to go to I want to go to this particular part which is this is a stepbystep process of how you can begin to unlock some favor in your life right so step one is that you need to show up so there's a particular thing that the generation does nowadays they would stay home on their bed and they would complain and they would say well like government are doing anything and this person are doing anything and whatnot and stuff like that and they continuously Point blame and blame the system but the first thing that they're not doing is that they're not showing up right so you could show up and you could show up in different ways so um there's been so many success stories and books that I've read where persons would have show up and they say hey I I'm looking for work thing d d I'm willing to probably work and start off for free I just want to be able to learn I want to be able to do certain things and so on and stuff but the Step One is that you need to show up right so you can't meet key persons you can't find persons who could see the talent of you and see the favor of you if it is that you're not showing up in any circles right so just for the persons who um they want to be in this particular shell and and and sometimes they might come to church and as soon as as the thing they go straight home or they go to work and as soon as and so on and they get they get invited to a function where it is that they could interact and so on they don't show up anyway because they might find that their particular time or their bedtime or their rest might be special to them well if it is that you don't show up you don't get the chance to meet new people you don't get the chance to socialize you don't get the time chance to see key persons and to and to find out and to have these conversations right step two step step two is to speak up right so um be prepared be prepared to have a perspective or to have a say in the Bible there's references to be ready to respond right be ready to respond um be ready to witness and so on now you need to be in a position to be able to speak up if called upon be prepared to ask ask a question be prepared to say something in terms of your perspective be prepared to say who you are and where you from and what it is that you do because if it is that you don't say anything well nobody's just going to magically spot what gift and talent that you have if it is that you don't say anything okay so step two is be able to to to speak up so show up and speak up step three is stand out right and how do we stand out well particularly um God's people have unique ways in which that they could stand out so one is the way that you dress the way that you you speak the way that you portray yourself um the way that you the type of conversations that you have um the way that you make an entrance all those different things um are different ways that you can choose to be able to stand out right so you could show up so begin to show up begin to speak up and begin to stand out so with your dress with how you walk with how you carry about yourself with how you speak and so on and key people that God could inform will begin to take notice and see what it is that they may be able to see within you that would be able to benefit you in the marketplace and in the workplace amen so we don't have long again right we're just going to wrap up by finishing up here in terms of understanding that God's favor is designed in a way for you to be able to shine for you to be able to influence and for you to able to impact there's plenty times that we choose to have a very very passive way of sitting back and not standing up and speaking out right and God wants this little light that you have for you to be able to let it shine right and our commandment to be able to witness and to compel and to to to compel persons by the highways and the byways is to be able to to come to Christ or to be able to come to God to find god um means that we need to be in that position to be able to speak and to influence so I just want to encourage you to look in the Bible and review some of the things that were said about the science of favor so that we too would be able to apply some of it into our lives and that we will be able to access as much benefit from the Lord there are scriptures that speak towards getting his love in favor and his hand upon your life and to be able to access his grace right so I just want us to stand and give him some praise hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus yes Lord thank you Father glory to God amen amen hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Heavenly Father Lord we ask that you come down Among Us Lord you said that where the tws and trees are gathered there you are in the midst Lord Jesus and we come to pray to you now Lord Jesus to ask you for your hand to be upon our life for your hand to be upon our purpose for your hand to be upon us so that we could continue to shine our light that we could continue to to guide and to grow and to help and to lead and to be able to benefit your kingdom Lord Jesus we want to be able to establish your kingdom your your ever increasing government Lord Jesus we want you to be able to to have favor in our life for you to be able to continue to bless us that we could not just be blessed but that we could be a blessing unto others Lord Jesus that we could be a Lifeline unto others that we could be a lantern unto others that we could be a lighthouse unto others we worship you today we ask for you to guide us in this such perilous times we want you to prepare us with your favor we want you to prepare us for your victory in your name we pray amen and amen just want to finish up by singing a song Lead Me Lord I will follow Lead Me Lord I will go you you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord I will go Lead Me Lord I will follow Lead Me Lord I will will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord I will go just one more time Lead Me Lord I will follow lead me Lord I will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord I will go we just want to close in a word of prayer and we want to bless the stuff that would have been and prepared Lord Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for today we thank you for the service today we thank you for this for this opportunity to be here Lord we ask you to grant us traveling mercies to our homes Lord Jesus and bring us back safely tomorrow for your service Lord Jesus Lord we also ask that you bless the refreshments that have been prepared may be nourishing to our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it in your name we pray amen and amen you may have your seats we are dismissed today amen
