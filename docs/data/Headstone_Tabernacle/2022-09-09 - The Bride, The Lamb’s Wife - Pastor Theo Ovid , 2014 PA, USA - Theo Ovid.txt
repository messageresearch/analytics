and gathered them out of the lands from the east from the west from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted when in them then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness for his wonderful works in the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness amen heavenly

you welcome and i want to introduce brother owen he really doesn't need an introduction we all know him in his life his ministry has been a blessing to us appreciate each one that has come out i did have a little um little quote here from brother coleman uh actually it's part of brother brown's quote here i'd like to read it's talking about the gift of a minister and where would we be unless we would have a true minister of the gospel speaking the truth before us you know brother coleman our brother brown here and i perceive you to be a prophet connorsville 53 now to bring up this faith in christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent creature i admire them and their gift is far beyond as far beyond anything could be done and anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which is which was a new testament modern a preacher prophecy means to foretell or tell something some personal thing in other words if you read the bible and start telling then that's a teacher but see but a prophecy is to testify or foretell and the spirit of christ is prophecy and i believe brother uh you know he's i've had our pastors faithful to the prophet's message a gift of wisdom of revelation to put the word of god together to prophesy to testify to foretell something by inspiration to be moved by the holy ghost to hold a straight course even to teach the truth directly and correctly never misinterpreting never mishandling never disallocating the word of god but always saying what the prophet said amen say what god says it is written amen and you know i've always i'm just a simple country boy abroad you know up here i i don't really belong here but you know god knows what he's doing he brought me in here from the corn fields of northern indiana this little cowboy you know and i believe in seedtime harvest you want a cornfield you gotta plant corn you can't plant corn expect wheat it don't change in the middle of the course and if you want to harvest the holy spirit you've got to sow the seeds that's why the prophet brought it and the ministers have brought it forth and i just appreciate the seed that has been placed in my soul amen you don't change halfway when you see a good fruit it started from the beginning as a good seed amen when you plant corn you can't expect anything else the lord knows each one of our hearts and it's and we're predestinated us to stand here today how before our weddings we didn't do it ourselves we have nothing to do with god's grace that we can stand here amen and he we stand here and we can gather together but unless the holy spirit comes and a supernatural element drops into this place lord we're just wasting our time sure we enjoy the fellowship many of you come miles around we we have a good time but unless the holy spirit drops here what good is it amen the prophet says the natural the supernatural element of any group of people is a lifeblood of that church amen it could be two or three gathered together wherever you are in whatever corner of the world he'd meet you there he has i'm a witness amen thank you thank you lord his brother uh brother would prepare to come forward and bring us the word this evening let's just sing a song um let's just sing that again just to be close to you trust so just to me close to you is my desire just to be close to you is my desire um just is is and also so as long experience if there is a purpose if there is a predestination if there that is defined for your life there is no way you could miss it all things truly work uh together reason that i try to push as much as i can years ago something to me that i think uh one of the pastors do all that you can finish it now right because children employees um that do not stop because of the religious beliefs and iraq itself how can nineteen years only fifteen years old want to leave america leave england and grow and join isis and be so committed to his high eyes and so on they see how you are with western uh dressing and clothing and materials and you you bloat your mind to think of christians training with those alone and heavy but we're gonna win amen are we gonna make it many groups start many people start is not distracted that's group right or a church overcoming a noble individual the bible itself said to him that overcome it belongs to the individual a pastor can overcome for you you have to overcome for himself for himself that life could flow through him to you but you have to overcome and it has been speaking and overcome you must not believe it and you are not alone in your struggle amen everybody have a struggle if you don't have a struggle something is wrong with you you've got to have a struggle that is what shows along with satan to choose your mind as a backup so you have nothing to do with that that's right the battle must just rage in your mind but you know who gonna win but the with written history and travel you can see something different but the reality is i did not meet but that's right i remember i ended up the opportunity to go to the paradigm [Applause] and asked that god will send men that would take the message and make more sense with his limited education that need to be unfolded not only that he was removing time you've got to run know get a kind of sign that i have to repeat to get messages and pick up again and write down the spot that's right so that's what i've been doing some pages here i know you can get some stuff but sometimes they get something right on the spot so in india i preach messages i've never done that before i chose only six services i told the version to take the first one and i will do the next five so i preached five on the table for the health and strength of the game the first message was the prophetic vision the second message of the world bride the tip of the land spoke the fourth was the inheritance divided and the last one of the final votes the prophetic vision was an overview of this whole inspiration and vision brown broad and just went on like that with the word with the blood and the inheritance the spirit may define it because as much as we love the moses inspiration moses is a prophet but then god told joshua moses take this people over and there was no physical joshua as we know the holy reading from revelation chapter 21. [Music] and they came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the months please and talk with me say come heather i wish you lead the bride the man's wife [Music] his wife has made himself 14. i press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus bless the believers we love you you don't worship you and jesus tonight i want to another subject the bride's that there is an absence of a passion and a desire for our reality in god and it almost appears as if it is up to god so just sit and wait sit and die sit and get home sit and kill him but i want to bring something a little different tonight from paul and paul said i press to watch the mark for the prize of the high calling of god because i want you to notice two things here one is i'll press towards the mark and that mark is the goal to obtain the price and the price is a reward says two things there is a goal and there is a reward right the goal is what you can accomplish right the goal is what you can achieve the reward that's given to you based upon [Music] you could fix and so forth but let me just give you a definition of what comes out as a goal i want you to bring that the goal is the end result or achievement in which effort is directed is a goal the end result or achievement in which effort is directed that's the goal all right i'm just going to read this is something the difference between a dream and a goal is that a dream is fantasy something you dream and never actually pursue but a goal on the other hand is a concrete thing in which you set into motion the steps therefore it's also the results of achievement towards the effort that's directed so our goal is a target a purpose our objective an intention all of that a goal is something that we want enough that we make an effort to reach it we must want it enough to make an effort to reach it our goal is not the same as i want amen hallelujah a person may want a nicer car they might want a nicer house not what you want but it's not strong enough to be a goal that you can say you're going to put aside money to get this side of the car okay this nicer house because there's a goal that's different now you make sacrifices you make an effort come on now because you want to achieve this goal it's not right blessed be the name of the lord so unless we want that car enough to work at getting in it is a fantasy right it's a dream it's not a goal but when we want to make that dream a reality then it's a goal when you put the effort behind it isn't that right do you love him tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord now a reward on the other hand is something given or received in recompense for worthy behavior or in retribution for evil acts that is what the definitional reward is are repeated a reward is something given or received in recompense for worthy behavior or in retribution for evil acts a reward is a thing given in recognition of one's service effort or achievement right isn't that right isn't that right yeah so therefore i think given recognition for one service achievement something give them an exchange for good behavior or good work something good that happens that you receive because of something you have done jesus said behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be so reward is coming according to works before without works faith is stone dead so people can say what they want about fate but this we're gonna get into that that faith will produce action is not right so jacob grace drew perfection with a prophetic vision for the bride amen isn't that right a vision that tells us that we are going to be perfect but we are saying jacob grace but he's a target that's right you can't just hope it's going to happen you've got to know it's got to happen you've got to want it to happen and have a purpose to see it happen it's a man right so therefore this vision this prophetic vision was sealed god told daniel go right away the book was sealed by revelation 10 to the seven angel the prophetic vision was unsealed but without a vision the people perish without a vision the ministers will be speaking on different topics and different issues but the dynamics has been here as the spirit of prophecy average is the testimony of jesus because as long as the word of fulfillment is not activated to be fulfilled in the only prophecy yeah prophecy in other words god spoke to abraham he could have anxiety as long as isaac did not get born abram could only speak by prophecy you are going to be delivered you are going to be set free and god put that over your life oh hallelujah glory to glory man glory all right so therefore the vision of the world was restored by william branner right he tied up the loose ends he tied up all outstanding issues so that you can know your husband even your mate so therefore your husband your husband was scattered throughout seven ages your husband was divided into the second past your husband his word was lost to the ages so god sent elias to restore back of your husband because the husband have a jonah for flesh and blood i'd never reveal this unto you but my father which is in heaven i'll reveal it to you upon this rock i'll build my church the true revelation of the word that's what the prophet said amen is the truth of vine again what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god and when god revealed to you his will for your life no man can take that off in our words faith is never a group thing that's right hey it's not a group thing that's right god of the wreck that individuals could get divine revelations we all feel safe among friends yeah okay i'll just say this week have a nice family very nice family beautiful family brothers and sisters they love each other hug each other like each other i'll be brilliant all of a sudden and that caused a lot of confusion and stuff but we thank god for joshua joshua this is my plan here at every place you put yourself it is hallelujah hallelujah god told joshua i have two things i want you to do two things it's not good enough to cross over no no no it's not good enough to spy out the land it's not only going to spread your map sheet and say this is my eyes that's on the map that's paper testimony we're not talking about people testing them we talking about the real thing when you read the map you want to know where you're going to put your actions you want to know where you're going [Music] we have that is what people think the message is you read the book you believe but if you receive isis is not coming the terrorist is not coming all right no you what you believe that's right all of us were reading this pokemon book and this is what i believe i read the bible i believe brother i'm a believer [Applause] mystery mystery mystery this is the way i challenge you you can't sit there just believe in anymore you've got to possess that reason right now when i think about it it's scary yeah it's scary yeah just like ebola is scary people are dying with something just some people wouldn't even want to travel why because they know that's dead that's death don't touch it it is death i mean real death but there's got to be something on the outside that's right that the devil recognizes off rule hands off get your hands over hallelujah oh glory hallelujah [Applause] ezekiel 9. ezekiel 9 god said send us who somebody i am god you are the holy spirit of this reveal aged the time of the revelation of these things and being known the fullness of the revelation bringing to a close of japanese age of cancer number 11 before the judgment of the underlying number 12. on the number 11 the 11th hour gentile guidance called out by a word message to receive the same penny the same holy ghost that they had in pentecost cannot bypass the holy ghost you cannot bypass these things we have got to receive it yeah i know it's wrong but i don't promise [Applause] that would take the message on he'd be an odd person but he writes after this and take the message on you listen to it as long as it's scripture right you see nothing is just open-ended god doesn't operate like that that's why paul said follow me he didn't say follow me no as i follow christ so you've got to know christ in order to effectively follow or give the lord some praise amen so jesus he said how be it that when the spirit is come he will guide you into all truth isn't that right so therefore what he hears he will speak he will show you things to come therefore the spirit of truth that was promised to come after the prophet can only speak according to the vision i want to say it again this prayer of truth that was promised to come after the spirit of prophecy after the prophet king can only speak according to the vision because the vision is from a point in time even the time of life for its fulfillment and manifestation all hell will be against this prophetic vision i will try to overthrow it but hell will fail because jesus and the gates of hell will not prevail against this rock revelation revealed by luke 17 30 the son of man working in and through that mighty prophet elijah isn't that right so what about him said love is an age the messenger of malachi 4 and religion 10 7 is going to do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he revealed the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revolutions contained in the seven scenes here we go it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths not understood by mystery truths amen truth a man cannot give you divine revelation that's right you could hear what man speaks but revelation comes from god and the holy ghost alone is the reveal of the revelation of god so even though i'm speaking the spirit can come upon you and reveal his word to you that has nothing to do with anybody else it is your father it is your husband it is elohim three the faith had to be ripened for the faith had to be manifested let's go again number one but obama had to restore the faith two the faith had to be revealed three the faith had to be ripened because you're faithful glory to god stop looking for gifts look for him the word your husband come on now hallelujah because his hallelujah [Applause] you are the wife you have got to come into a divine revelation who you are in god remember the story of whatever by the man looking for a wife went to this party and so on and everybody carrying on and put on the dress and so on and he was fed up with from listening those words those words got washed and cleaned man she was bleeding and she came over there she's smiling she's in an atmosphere she just got a promise that's right revolution does that so she was in that revelation spirit right that's the oh you're smiling like that you're always watching girl um he told me i'm gonna get his name all right i'm gonna get a new name you gotta be kidding me she said you're gonna get married that was the joke of the night they went late night laughing they laughed they couldn't that's right maybe what's your goal what's the bride goes she's one thing you need ready she got the clothes she got the dress oh my god those cousins say she in fantasyland it's fantastic man and i'm showing that dress i have no fantasy man not everybody gonna be ready he says now watch you see the devil power is the debt he has no power beyond death dead ends his power that's right so therefore the devil will bring you down to death and then his job finished but faith here we go faith sees the resurrection amen amen of the resurrection that's the power to believe so when you have faith to see resurrection power is finished in your life falling doesn't mean finish that's right vote stuck with f yeah hallelujah pouring doesn't mean you're finished because it's falling down god jesus said destroy this body and i'll look at that myself oh i knew mechanics [Applause] hallelujah bring back the church to the word what is this messenger of malachi 4 to do restore back the original fate the resurrection faith that they see in jesus after he had raised from the dead see him working among them so what must you see you must see jesus back among us since the prophet left so the prophetic vision that shows what the field is and what it is for it is resurrection faith to bring down dynamics for birth and refilling amen that is what the vision is it is to produce not just faith because peter had that but they went in with the mode and under a crying move but when jesus appeared unto them and gave a private ministry to this elected bond then their faith was sealed so upon that resurrection faith in them he said receive it holy amen he knew now they were ready for divine promise don't walk oh what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival that's a goal that's not a reward that's a goal that is the church understanding by revelation that the minister don't make a revival it's the people that bring a revival oh it should make a church that would make a revival here in phoenix that people will be flying from europe to see what's taken we're not talking about that no no no with it i like how you say it no no no that we don't want to connect ourselves we want people to come and see that's right because the only way invisible to become do you hear what i'm saying tonight the only way invisible could become visible is for the world to become flesh [Applause] we're not playing with words this is not a word game no this is reality this is life and death this is the angel on the earth but the plagues but the viles oh hallelujah arizona maricopa valley a city called phoenix there was something broke out dear until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even a road is being manifested aha so now we talk about thunders being manifested no not talked hearing more teachings and hearing more teachers you cannot tell me we have 40 more years of mother teaching people you know i like how those brothers used to pray they don't usually say uh i say to the lord god i'm gonna say the god of hebrews hallelujah hallelujah remember this whole prophetic vision was to set us up for the intelligence the dynamics even the voice of the archangel which is the second form the voice appearing the trump the coming of the lord so jesus filled himself with him to identify the shout out jesus is going to feel himself jesus will feel himself in that bride amen is not right so christ seven living voices must come into the bride to manifest the voice of the archangels this sign of this voice shall face appear in ephesians 4 the word a fightful ministry amen and the fight for ministry will it become the world itself that's right uh in these offices we have to seek christ let the men see christ and if we're not seeing christ that's not hypothesis that's a fall but not part of the fight you have to see christ europe africa south america west indies america there is nobody has that ministry presently so we have nothing to follow anybody that's right they could scream a demonstration that you said may have rest in the power of the power of god oh hallelujah that is the gospel that is the good news that that man is energized are you with me so therefore the fightful ministry will become the very word and the word is a conductor of the spirit are you with me so i told them it was cut up so the current couldn't flow so first he had to restore the broken path he had to restore the loose ends you have to store all the truths that need to be cleared up and when he restored it there was current in the lane hallelujah [Music] but there's a will of god that he was totally connected with even outside that will there was problems there was always men trying to pull him here and pulling me and convinced here almost like if he could manufacture the vision the vision came from god that's right can't this is what we have got to hear you know what could it be could it be soon practically so i think i would like to see it so yeah you could like it you could like it unlike it i have nothing to do with what god we want to share the lord hallelujah the lord amen so therefore the fightful ministry will become the conductor of the spirit in which the truth will be spoken and the spirit gonna flow freely and you will see it emanating out of them even the spirit of christ this ephesians 4 ministry will bring the bride to perfection because the bride must come to perfection the virtue is going to be poured into the bride and it cannot be ported he said such as i have i could release i could give hallelujah notice the man did not ask peter to be healed he doesn't rise up [Applause] praise the lord oh see yes i see the eyes oh my gosh [Applause] she had something the virgins did not hurt [Applause] yeah yeah they had a testimony they never fooled her wrong they never did this but she had a testimony young is that's what life is like you've got to accomplish things is is as we get narrower to home ground it's supposed to be clearer and clearer not confused and confused no it must be no questions one time they kept asking jesus why are you speaking in parables and afterwards don't speak us plainly he was bringing in my plane and playing unto them in resurrection you open the understanding and he opened the scriptures why he wanted to get clarity of purpose and vision you see because our goal is that uh i want to go to school or i want to get a subject or i want to get a car no a goal means i that's my goal and the few people have really achieved the few people who could write right where they want to go that's why god root we haven't got down to god's goal yet you know we're just talking about your own answers listen it was so rough in his mind he had to put your name in blood and splash some blood on him because the devil is going to see all except those whose names are written in the last book of life so in the vision of writing your name you put your name and put blood on it the devil's [Applause] so when you come to church you come to see if your name is there you come to hear if your name is being called and when the world is preached your name is foolish you've got to hear your name and if you hear your name you'll be him like job [Applause] what do you mean preacher i mean you're one in a million more than a million my god if i have to die in the morning i'll do something today i have one in a million [Applause] to the overcomers as the ministry of the morning to announce the coming sun notice gods and wise men to give testimony witness that christ was born wise men and these men traveled for two years as a rebuke to the blindness of the present tense manifestation of gods they want a quote they want something because they recognize is that's yours is it's a vision of perfection that does not cater for the humanistic realm it is only for divine revelation and vision the humanistic realm is where the intellectual faith is at the mind games the church politics 201 new name is a reward you can't achieve you mean women can be a goal that's right three or four is a reward i promise rather than [Music] qualified to be his wife amen but there are goals that you can achieve always goes to be on fire i try go and suppress the battle lord god that you could pray every day you could bring your bible that you could stop being so normal hallelujah because god said don't cut that you'll be fine all right so he's doing other stuff not out of the program of god but the power is still there because the covenant is with the gear that's right just that seven rocks as long as it's not cut you'll find assassin's creed to the edge [Music] down here and he shake himself one more time recognize samson you're just like another man somebody said this is normal yeah you mean all of what i had was a got power because woman was obeying god that's what i'm saying people take siblings of god for granted that if god is with them i have a quote but says god will bless a man stand up very good either for other men and what takes him out of pastor we have not [Music] saw a man standing looking at him he's just saying when you borrow his i want to pray for you you might have to keep watching the ground but until the child is saying lord god don't let that man attitude stop this from moving that [Music] he's a good man he's a nice man he doesn't take birth is oh in my heart i am trusting that god they know you're convinced of that because you're convinced of that you cannot put any man words hallelujah because is the final arbitrator why because the word comes to a prophet [Applause] that was echoed in new york city that's right that's the message that brother coleman preached that's right he didn't preach a different message he preached brother branham's message [Applause] about himself that's right his family and his church is not the same that's why if you put it all together you'll get a lot of problems right divide it you'll have no problems with every man have a right to his own inspiration and he said when i'm here i'll do this i'll do that that is his own inspiration i predict that he will come by 1977 that's one of my own inspiration he said that's not just the world every one of us have a right to have our own inspiration about things it's not safe and it's not the terrible it's just your own inspiration about something yes yeah it may come to pass it will come to pass but he echoed his message he echoed it with clarity with vision and that is what why i am here tonight because of that echo i'll try if he didn't care about the fightful ministry i was going to be fooled also but he said that the fightful ministry must come through those seven books that's right and they must be tested and proven and tried dynamics have to come and adopt them and place positionally in the ephesians ministries hallelujah that is what was good [Applause] this is no oh my god amen in other words but a cold man as well there is no vacancy to replace him so anybody apply to replace a possibility application form that purpose is over now god wants to do something else because the land has to be divided and it cannot be divided as a bunch of groups here this one do this here [Music] glory to god in other words you're not going with the tide you're not going with the flow you're not going with everybody going that way one time 400 prophets were saying the same thing yeah listen to this the echo ministry can only echo by having a revelation of the son of man the new man your personal ministry placed my new god by god in new york fulfilled his commission to hear out and cut the blind promises and make more sense to what the prophet spoke this was done by bringing all the promise into a prophetic vision of perfection through seventh under buildings wow in the place of time into seasonal production into proving these virtues and us would you fill in the power being released vindicated to the ministry of christ in other words it is impossible for anybody to claim having a ministry of jesus christ and all power through him now that's right when the woman touched jesus he said he said the power left me that's right that's christ that's right that's christ that's right not a mystery about my mouth dynamics is that's different [Applause] 1974 put it all together as a vision the bride's only goal right but i'm saying one quote he says the church is so powerless the only weapon they have is arguments it's terrible and you come down the spirit of truth directs us to the word that explains why all the misses have been known to the ages because the siege was not yet open so whatever and everything else is settled again he winds up the loose ends that these fellow proved acts and the mysteries come down from god as the will of god and reveals the entire revelation of god then the godhead and everything else is settled right so the godhead was settled so i don't understand how anyone become an unsettling godhead that's the only way i can say it [Music] being spoken about the godhead let us make mind that the god will complete we always taught that is god a deal and we are man down here but we are going to find out that man is is the bride you are the holy spirit i am not talking to your human spirit no that will be destroyed now that you know that you are the holy spirit you say the name i want to let you know that this teacher that is not right now is false is controlled and annoys it it is contrary to what but one brought amen in this message is up when you're going to thinking about it and make three different individuals some make it one day but wrong noted this is not three gods so therefore it is not you cannot have a person without a personality right the black cat would be taking a trinity without having a personality isn't that right but obama said it is tree manifestation of the same god it's the attributes of god god the father that was in the wilderness and fulfill the fire and in that same god express himself in his son which was the same god not three gods three manifestations of the same god so many of you came down the holy ghost and see the second person of the trinity but it's not even mentioned in the bible there was no such a thing the word trinity is not even with the lids of the bible and when you look at jesus you regard him as the truth no the second opportunity that and that's the reason you get nowhere oh praising it now people act that god is obligated to meet them on the basis of their theology now people act like that they won't associate even with each other the trinity or pentecost not associated with oneness and so on there is no fellowship at all and they wind the people's minds around so bad that they're even against one another that's right and numbers 23 19 says god is not a man that he will deny oh do you love him tonight blessed be the name of the lord harlem we are praised god and brother and the bible says isaiah 44 6 does say the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and the last beside me there is no god amen isaiah 45 i am lord there is no earth there is no god beside me i greedy has not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else now there is something called the new age movement and a woman named shirley mclean wrote a book all out in the limb in which he says all power and knowledge and truth are within us and waiting to be unlocked we are gods and might as well get good at it i am god shirley mclean and the few aspects of the new age have shocked traditional religious people with her iron god uh exclamations but this what i'm hearing now belongs to the new age movement he's got a new revelation or a new mystery this is actually a new age i am god contain a whole metaphysics in a nutshell it's a whole it contains all the parts okay now i am god belief is directly derived from a man called something jean knight ramta ramta is convinced his audience that each one of them is gone i think this is a hindu guy see what it is about hindu guy could you just wait one second please place hallelujah he said if you want to see what god looks like go look in a reflector you're looking god straight in the face watch um age is often a film that all is god hence all is good evil is usually tied to ignorance and a lack of enlightenment so um from a new age perspective you begin to have an illusion that you are limited you begin that you have an illusion that you are limited and finite a new angel will tell you that you are separated from god only in your consciousness you need to be enlightened you have forgotten your true identity you are a victim of a false sense of a separate identity which blinds you from your essential unity with god and this is the cause of all the problems so therefore you are god that is the same lie that satan told me oh yeah if you eat up this tree isn't that right so then in a book she said i am god i am god i know that i exist therefore i am and since i am part part of the force then i am that i am wow that i am this is new image isn't that right now in the new old in the old testament it was blasphemy to say that you were gone that is why they took stone to stone jesus because if you are god that's right if you can prove it but as long as you can prove it stones yes so he said he said he is the son of god and to say you are the son that means you were god this serious blasphemy and it was but jesus was god so it was not blasphemy oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord are you with me praise god so this uh ladies her name is william benzenzano she said shelby mcqueen was right i am god this is the article for 25 years she was struggling with that book and i'm going to summarize it this woman she went 1987 to a christian retreat and the pastor was preaching i was telling them don't read that book but she wanted to read the book when she read the book she get connected with it and so on so listen to this part he said so so mclean work has inspired me and i've got over the conflict with my church membership i have grown beyond a message for over the years and um i know a lot of our spiritual adventures now i believe that i will help prepare people to accept a more advanced message i bring into a higher purpose to help them bring them to the part of life so let's just say now this is the path that is that is really nerve-racking to me these statements are best perhaps only be understood from a mystical viewpoint part of my mission is to help them understand take me literally i am god seems blasphemous i remember misled perhaps i am one with god might be more acceptable but mystics and philosophers uh to the current ken wilber confirm their view of the stronger statement they confirm in one confirming man that they are god yeah so okay so i'm gonna skip just giving us oh glory glory hallelujah she said it will compare to the christian experience of being forgiven of and i mean that with all my heart oh glory hallelujah you see i believe it but the comment had lived on long enough he was going to correct a lot of stuff that i wouldn't go any further with that but that is what i have to see considering that by the grace of god blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah o glory to god amen praise god so listen even though god promised after 400 years he would bring his people out with a mighty hand after promise after promise but god had to wait if we have to get dynamics to be a people so faith not as a description of a belief this is my feet that is my feet because what is that are you a christian it means do you have a life that's right do you have something that god could recognize to be of him amen oh glory i want to be a christian if i have to sit down and start preaching i will still be a christian i don't need to be behind this pulpit to be a christian i christian because i love the lord and i know you love the lord i love him and i still love him and with the preacher i still love him and if i don't have to preach i will still love him hallelujah abraham left this country so faith is active faith is an action created by the confession of a belief taking another paper testimony i believe this make it on paper that's not faith save had action with it abraham left this country noah built an act isn't that right there is an action not an understanding of revelation only but faith is a channel that produces action perfect by faith is not the destination oh hallelujah hate is the seed and jesus is the conversation he's coming for the fruits [Applause] all this mystery mystery comes down as the word and the word is the seed but jesus has not called for seed he's coming for fruit what does that mean i mean the seed goes through processes in your life i begin to conclude that the sea is what you have received all these years but he got come back to hear what you have read did you hear this book did you read this book did you get this mystery did you get this mystery no it has to be christ in you man who is christ christ is the mission of god revealed i'm not even talking about a book i'm talking about that man with the beard that man that walked in jerusalem that man was god expressed that man was god revealed that was the word but that same word is what the son of man revealed oh hallelujah oh glory to god so therefore the fruit is the destination the harvest yeah even the rest even charity a labor to enter into the rest it is descriptive correctly description to the uh as to the action necessary in order to achieve the coming to the rest ah leave at the end to israel amen that's a beautiful description always describe the wars in the land but the land is the land where you'll get rest you'll leave up and enter into the rest that's right if not right so malakai they do two things turn our hearts back to the children and turn our hearts back to the feet of the father isn't that right isn't that right oh glory now when the context of this destination is back to the faith and there is only one lord one faith one baptism another ephesians defeat god's fate even christ in you the hope of glory all right so when christ is formed the new hope of glory that's the fate that's right that's the thing that says pick up your blood and walk that's the faith and say go and sin no more that's the faith says amen before the doctrine touches my wife the jewel will go down that's the fate that was christ in the prophet that will be christ inside of you just a little more amen praise god hallelujah because you must be the word manifested to be the bride preach your message 21st of september and i didn't even get to read a quote but i want to read it here praise the lord but obama invisible bride he said and the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it would have to be the word manifested to be the bride of christ right now there is no word manifested yet people only talk in word the bride will have to be the word manifested behold i show you the will not be manhandled so god do you understand the lord himself the same with a shout to get this right out that shout but around you labored to bring a shock message look how long he died in 1965 wasn't even born yet but god brought [Music] me personally i reject my intervention trying to help god from that standpoint that's right if we could get started go and do the rest as it gets started getting the mechanics right getting your hearts right you could do that no business that could work for you you could do that love your husband save your children amen love your wife and so on do what is right do what is christian do what is in order you do that and god will bless you oh hallelujah and don't be afraid of mystics you have never been here before my god is yes joshua send me spice and when they got a report they see them people training behind that wall the walls people wanted because hallelujah so the manifestation of the holy spirit is the seed of the kingdom so the bride will now be handled my hand is that right so the bride will not come on the number six man or man's spirit will not be able to control manipulate or incorrectly influence the land's life right when brother branham said people are right he said no one can make them do no otherwise can make them do otherwise they have dusted the lord or they keep still notice they don't have an interpretation they don't have some man's idea they have just said the law now the bride is not a prophet so therefore the pride is seeing what the prophet brought because the spirit the brain and the prophet says the same thing that's right so the bride will have thus shared the lord and what she speaks will have already been spoken in the world that's right she's not speaking new revelations it's the same revelation with faith and power behind it hallelujah hallelujah the prophetess who brought the lord william branham was the most vindicated prophet ever he had the same lord his name and he put it on books and tapes has revealed the promises of the land the new land isn't that right lord jesus i promise you build us let's just hear you know jesus come in three names something son of man son of god son of david son of david is in the millennium you leave that name out okay now son of man is jesus flesh producing seed so he said son of man is the sower of the seed now watch son of god is spirit but i said god changing his mask in other words seven manifestation of the holy spirit is the spirit is the son isn't that right but when you're a son of man he's coming with seed which is word which is logos isn't that right now when every age once the enemy releases a power god releases another power to combat the enemy a man a eagle a lion every age once the enemy comes forth with something there's all the power raise up to challenge what the enemy pollutes isn't that right whether it's false teaching force manifestation or interpretation god reason of power he's not right when the enemy coming like a flood the supreme standard here's where i want to go number one son of man word seed son of god through the seven ages so son of god follows son of man seven church ages son of god with the problem so he come back with food again what's the following son of god oh give us the praise hallelujah hallelujah all right so the question is tonight what is the fallout son of man messes the promises i see tonight is the son of god spirit dynamics come to the bride just as it was in the upper room may not bless you hallelujah the great let me know is to be a perfect man on the earth may the lord bless you lord amen oh praise your holy name oh hallelujah the lamb's wife amen hallelujah thank god it's not a group thing it's individuals amen it's an individual press that's right amen towards the towards the target all right amen but the press is your life hallelujah personal battles you have to go through amen hallelujah oh it is grace grace praise grace it is grace is great is is hallelujah glory don't stop worshiping hallelujah what a mighty god we serve what a mighty god we serve angels bow before him god we serve what our mighty god we serve heaven and earth oh what a mighty god we serve hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we wear jerusalem is we wear is where hallelujah
