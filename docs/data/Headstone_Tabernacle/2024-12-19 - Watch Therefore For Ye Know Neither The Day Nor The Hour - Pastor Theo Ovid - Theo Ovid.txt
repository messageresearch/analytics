atmosphere here tonight that's a beautiful song a long time I've heard that one Jesus breaks every fet amen God bless you if have your Bibles I like listen into Matthew 25 want to read from verse 13 to 30 Matthew 25 I know we have been here but again instructed and Andrew shares things on it but here we are again tonight watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he give five talents to another two to another one to to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey then he that received the 5 talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents likewise he that had received two he also gained another two and he that had received one went and died in the earth and hid the Lord's money after a long time the Lord of whose servants cometh and reckon it with them so he came he that had received five talents came brought other five talents in Lord thou deliver unto me five talents behold I've gained besze them five ttimes more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has a few thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the Lord he also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou deliver unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents besides them his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the Lord and that then he which had received one Talent came and said Lord I knew that thee that thou art a hard man reaping where thou has not shown and Gathering where thou has not stred and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth Lo here thou Hast that is dine his Lord answer answer said and said unto him thou Wicked and full servant thou knewest that I reap where I SED not gathered where I have not sted thou oughtest therefore to have put my money into the exchanges and then at my coming I should have received my own with Usery take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which had 10 talents for every one that ha shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he had and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth may God bless his word you may be seated praise God thanks for coming out tonight we not gathered together in vain we're not preaching the word in vain we're not speaking these things in vain and the title have tonight is watch therefore for you know not neither the day nor the hour and uh I believe this is a very important session tonight so just listen closely to what we we'll see what the Lord will says now in the Amplified verse 13 says watch therefore give strict attention and be cautious and active for you know nether the day nor the are when the son of man will come and in verse 23 see MiFi his master said to him well done you upright honorable admirable and faithful servant you have been faithful and trustworthy over a little I will put you in charge of much enter into the share and share the joy the Delight the blessedness which your master enjoys and Matthew 2529 it says for everyone who has will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance but from the one who does not have even what he does have will be taken away verse 30 and throw the good forn nothing servant into outer Darkness there'll be weeping and grinding of teeth I have a question tonight why should God give more than you can manage why why should God give you more than you can manage because in the scripture we read unto one he give five talents to another to another one to every another two and another one to every man according to his several ability and straight where he took his journey and the thing about it the gift is there the talent is there but what it is what you do with it the talent the gift that God has given because God by discernment didn't give them more than they have the ability to manage because what was happening there is a test what was happening there is faithful test faithfulness what was happening there is God was giving them the little to see how they manag what he give them because based upon how you manage what God give you or what God give you as a talent or whatever blessing God could promote you and give you more am to manage now this scripture about the read here Ephesians 4 is a familiar scripture Paul speak I therefore the prison of the Lord beseech you you walk worthy of the vocation where you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing in love enduring endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there's one body one Spirit your calling one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of us all who is above all through all in you all but this part I want to get to but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so everyone according to Paul's scripture here have Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ and that scripture in yet Grace God's unmerited favor was given to each of us individually not indiscriminately but but in different ways in proportion to the measure of Christ rich and bounous gift here we go are you with me this tonight so therefore these gifts and these talents and these several abilities that God give us is like a starting point and I calling it a temporary position note these words now a temporary position the gift or Talent gives you a temporary position that is connected to a time element so it's not you have a gift and you have a talent and 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years pass 100 years pass it's not like that because when these guys was given the gifts and talents the man went away on a long journey they don't they know NE not the hour he would come whenever the master come he come for a reconing or come to account what was given you what was gifted to you what was talented to you that time period I like to use this word call this time a time of probation probation to see what you will do not to see the excuses you make I'm stuck not my job there's a problem someone else to fix I'm not good at this I'll get it eventually excuses the asking is what was done with what was given to you amen the talent the gift the measure are you with me tonight your testimony God give me or God give you or God revealed to me or God blessed you and God's not with you and 20 years God heal you that is not the issue at hand you know you have a gift you know it's from God but the gift is not the issue you know without a doubt that God has forgiven you but what have you done with the Forgiveness that God has given you and the reason I bring out this one is because it's a story in the Bible that addresses this not because somebody is Forgiven and they get blessed and they uh forgiveness they use it correctly listen to this here though Jesus speaks Matthew 18 therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven lik un to a certain King which would take account of his servants uh one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded to be sold his wife children all that he had had payment to be made the servant fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me I will pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion loosed him and forgive him of the debt the same servant not another one same man same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him 100 P now bear in mind he was owing 10 ,000 Talent well I had the conversion of that there a lot of money and his friend or fellow servant owed him a 100 P he laid hands upon Him took him by the throat man the man gone under V he under violence now took him at the said pay me what the O is and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me I will pay thee all but and he would not and went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when this fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told the Lord all what was done then his Lord after that he had called him said oh thou Wicked servant I forgive thee all that debt because thou desirest me shouldest not thou have compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee his Lord was wrought and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that will you unto him so likewise this is Jesus talking now shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses well give the Lord some Praises tonight so having a testimony God called me I know I'm a seed I'm a child I'm a gift when God call me somebody take a picture it have a light it have a rainbow a RB on my head a on my foot all that is fine but that's not the issue it comes back to what you do and how you do with what is given to you so I believe this temporary place that God gives is misunderstood this temporary place remember the disciples how much he had A2 of them and 70 of them walk away and all of them were given the anointing to share in the ministry of Jesus Christ they were not yet converted they had temporary power but they could testify oh I cast out a devil and they can testify to their friends all what they're doing and they working with Jesus and what it sounds good it sounds great and we jacket like Jesus a tie like Jesus a shoes like Jesus a sandle like Jesus all that is good but that's not the issue so disciples were given power to over the devils and cast diseases so it comes down now to our behavior and people find themselves Christians church members Believers with more arrogance more Pride the Bible teaches us how to manage self- thoughts I got this by inspiration so I'm just saying what I got that's why I presented tonight and I feel it's very important the Bible teaches us how to manage selft thoughts manage how you are to see your yourself and when you overvalue yourself you're heading into trouble as we see in the stock market when you see it overvalued it is due for correction Philippians 2 3 and 4 Philippians let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in here we go liness of Mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others in the Amplified it says here do nothing from factional motives true contentiousness Strife selfishness or for unworthy ends or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance instead in the true Spirit of humility I like that true Spirit of humility loneliness of mind so this here is Gospel this here is scripture telling you about you telling about you how you supposed to think about you how you supposed to see others and treat others in loneliness of Mind Let each regard the other as better than and Superior to himself thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourself not bringing down somebody not pulling down your brother not be latting and be litting your brother trying to embarrass your brother it didn't say do that it say make them Superior esteem them higher show them that respect that is the word so when you operate with that understanding and thinking you can't overvalue yourself because you are operating in the spirit of the word to esteem your brother better than yourself because God promotion doesn't come from the east or the West promotion comes from the Lord so not to pull on your brother but to esteem highly so we see now it's not your gift or Talent or position that takes you onto adoption but your behavior amen these servants were told well done not well talked or well spoken it was action that was taken that could be confirmed by the coming Lord that he says well done because you are faithful well done not because you preach well you are faithful here we go in the temporary position I put you in with what you have let me repeat that you are faithful in the temporary position I put you in with what you have I will see what you will produce according to your several abilities Give the Lord some Praises I feel his presence here tonight Hallelujah I will see what you will produce according to your several abilities because you can manage well and be faithful to the little I give you I will promote you to be over bigger things or many things so it come back to the question why should God give you more than you can manage I see how I could manage $1,000 I could give you $10,000 I see I could manine $10,000 I could give you a 100,000 I see we can man 100,000 I give you a million but you can't man $100 you want a, you want $10,000 you can't manage a penny a good you spending all because you refuse to get the discipline to say you know what I have to manage you cannot manage man $1,000 and you're pray call give me 20 what you going to do with it you going to mash it up you're going to wreck it because you have to be faithful in little before you could be faithful in much Oh Glory to God I want to go back to a scripture we had read and I preaching it and judges s spoken about Gideon then zubel okay want to drop this here I want to bring some observation here that Gideon did not choose the 300 am the pastor didn't choose the 300 the Apostle didn't choose the 300 the prophet didn't choose the 300 the teacher didn't choose the 300 God did then jobel who was Gideon the Judges chapter 7 and all the people that with him rose up early pitched besides The Well of harod so the host of the midianites were the north side of them by the hill of Mor in the valley and the Lord said to Gideon the people people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands and the reason is least Israel vaun themselves against me saying my own hand had saved me so God know the heart of man he know the even the wickedness of man and he knew if he let that number loose they going say we win we lick them up we beat them we strong we had the church and tongue we had the might Mighty ones we the mighty gentle Warriors and the whole drama so God says I don't want them Pride the self and say my own hand had saved me see that's human you know you and your flesh you and yourself now therefore go and Proclaim to the head of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early you're frightened go home now listen the test come yet this is just checking the temperature of who afraid the test is down to the water you know that where the message is at everybody go in and drink but the test come yet you know this is who is afraid he telling Gideon this one the real test he will give this is Gideon telling the people under God's guidance say to them whoever is afraid fearful let him return and depart early from M gillad and they return 20 and 2,000 people and there remain 10,000 32,000 number start of it Brad the bottom soon as God say who fearful go back 20,000 walk I said God bless you they take the Bible and they go home and the Lord s unto Gideon the people yet are too many bring them down into the water and I will I will who will try them the I will try them for the dear and it shall be that whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee he tell test he watch it shall be whom i s to thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee whosoever shall s to thee this shall not go with the the go with let them go to the waters all man going and drink all man have books and tapes all man hearing message and services and sermons and Mysteries and Revelations so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon he tell him what is the separation Point yet Gideon doesn't know the Lord said unto Gideon everyone that lath up the water like with his tongue as a dog lap him shall thou set by himself likewise everyone that bowed down to his knees to drink so Gideon's job was to observe two things who lapping like a dog and who bowing the knees as they lap he said you go here as they bow he said you go there so Gideon that all Gideon doing you know he don't know what God going to choose yet you know God only tell him this is instructions now who Laing put them on this side who who B the knees put them on that side and 9,700 bow their knees and on the laping side had 300 let's continue so he brought on the people to the water the Lord said everyone right like but the number of them that La putting their hand to the mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bow down their knees to drink water and the Lord said unto Gideon this is where God dropping down now buy the 300 men that La will I save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and and let all the other people go every man into his place go home go back home in other words so let's say this way it was a water test not drinking but how oh give the Lord some Praises tonight everybody was in the pool you know everybody was in the water you know but God watching was how how people have books and tapes and what how what is the measuring line all right we'll get back to this let me skip down here but he's talking about this evil age he said it may seem strange a very strange thing in this grace of in this age of Grace God is taken the people for his name's sake that is his bride in this evil age that should be called the age of evil the very age that God is calling the people for his name's sake by Grace out and is calling and evil age now we'll prove by the Bible that this is the age we are speaking of very strange thing to think that in a evil age like this that God then will be calling his bride you notice he said a people not a church why it is called the church but he would call a people now a church is a gathering of many people of all different makeups but God is saying he he didn't say I'll call the Methodist Baptist Pentecostal he said he will call a people am so in other words he would say he call this Tabernacle and this assembly and this local Christian Fellowship no he didn't say that a people one from the Methodist one from the Baptist one from the Lutheran one from the Catholic do they preach at the message no they preach their Church their Revelation they have it and and all kind of drama that is false that's a lie from the pit of Hell you know God don't have no tribes you know God don't have no organization or no group you know it's individuals we are Gentiles we are called as individuals to catch Revelation in this in this hour here oh glory to God we gather together as a church but in the church itself have three kinds of Believers Hallelujah bring them down to the water and see how they la oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he is calling not a church group here we go but a people for his name that receives his name engag in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of him by predestination just as a man that chooses the right wife in life and ordained to be part of his body that is the bride of Christ will be and is now from God ordained of God to be part of that body notice not when someone has said what someone's called but what God choose before the foundation of the world and in and is calling let say pause you a minute what if Gideon knew what the test really was and who was the go then he could tell La laap lap lap laap laap call cin Bo la la la you see what God did there he a tell him how they going to UNF fall know just put them lapers so and put the one who B so and then say these 300 that is how God has work it have no as as you pass pass side pass none of that God has no respect of persons but Bram he said watch last week in Matthew 24 it was the most even age all the age of Deceit for shall arise now a cold formal sa church and so forth M theology the elect will never pay no attention to that but it's up te almost like the real thing just leaving one word is all you have to do promise of the age very great time so when I was dry dead Church with that the Temptation is the two Spirits so close it would receive the very elect if it was possible what would God call a people out of the E for for his name and he answers it the reason is to try her his bride I'm the eye and the bride and going in Rapture is that right this is the word here this a no Carnival thing you're dancing and going put on a mask band and a masquerad and then dance on the band and going not know the reason he call out in his evil age is to try her is this the gospel is this the message we preaching here now it's to try her his bride when she is made manifest been tried been proven proved to Satan as the seed starts in the ground it come to carriers the life of it but it ends up the same seed like when they went in the ground and just as the gospel when it fell in the denomination ner Rome it ends up a super organization just as the seed of the church fell back there here we go with signs wonders and the living Christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back again the original faith that was once given Oh Glory to God he is prophesying he is saying that the last day Church would come under the ministry of Malachi 4 and it will be restored back to the original faith that was once given it going to be the same life same signs same wonders same Miracles same pay Alpha and Omega is the same oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like eveall Give the Lord a shout on that one this bride is not like Eve she is not that type of a woman she will be Tried by his word the bride as Adam bride was Tried by the word Adam bride believe every bit of the word all but confused on One Promise he's the same yesterday today and forever but fail on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and the people has called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing not by denominational Truth for in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word to live by one word misinterpreted a man called Satan in the person of an animal called The Serpent Satan in this person would talk to Eve and misinterpret the word and that's how everything fell Oh Glory to God and the seed in Genesis is what we see in here manifest the sodomite the lgbqt whatever L and those alphabet people and so on like that all that was seated down in Genesis and now it's being manifest in the open Oh Glory to God hallelujah and that Royal seed fate that was in Abraham that was in Genesis is going to be manifested in the open AB waed 25 years to produce Isaac Hallelujah this bride waiting all these years will produce the Messiah M on the earth one more time this last day bride will be Messiah oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah so the minister is not to try the people God will try them gon didn't try the people God tried them he tried them by the water isn't that right praise the Lord again hallelujah praise God praise God so all the groups in the message coming out to the water but God is the one who see them how they drinking H let's pull it straight now how the drinking Gideon was told to watch him watch that's right he watched them and he obeyed what God Said isn't that right so the separation came by God himself noting how they drank and and and today is what kind of life you're living it's not putting a book on your head it's not wearing walking with a Bible but that measurement on that quality is going to be the life praise God I've heard it said ministers outside the pulpit their behavior is questionable when they come in the Pulpit it's God is the word but they have issue with the man and his life something wrong there something is wrong there because he's supposed to be one in the pulpit and outside it's one life it's one Lord It's one spirit it's one baptism it can't be one man outside and one man inside of here because under the anointing I think brother BR talk about it some woman kind used to be drunk orever it is but when hit she be pit so is his word coming out and P they were gifted people gift and talent that God could use and we gone past that age now it is a more than a gift a gift to speak a gift to preach is more than giftedness gift and calling is without repentance people born with these things they have these things inside of them it just need anointing to come upon them and out it comes but that is not what we talking about it has to have a measuring line and that measuring line will be the life oh give the Lord some Praises not because you're in a message church not because you have books and tapes but what kind of life is being measured up with the word hallelujah glory to God glory to God we believe that thank you Lord Jesus let's go wow brother Bram said we got more unbelief than we ever had ministers have organized themselves great denomination like incubated chicken hatch out by the grinder brings them out like that what we need in our churches is a man that got an absolute what we need in Methodist Church the Baptist Church the Pentecostal church the presan church is a man of God that will stand tied to the word of God and to Christ here we go I've read read this many times and bring that congregation under the condition where each member walks in the condition of his word of this word so it can't be my daughter or my son he going through stress so therefore she could wear Min skirt she could wear this and wear that if the parents compromise with the children then where is that word condition that going to hone them and hold them they have to know this is God requirement God not cting to flesh God not cting because they young devil has take young people to hell too do you get what I'm saying people has get killed and perish now age doesn't matter you know and in Ezekiel 9 it say slay utterly young old male female little children but come not near any man with that Mark so we cannot do like we are sorry because we are in the flesh or in carnality or in natural we have to leave it to God bringing the test I tell brother Gideon beautifully brought it out like in the exam room they say one and 1al 2 2 andal 4 4 and four equal eight but in the exam room they gave one and two and if you're dumb Dum and you say teacher never give me one and two before but get two and two he give you one and one you have to deduct what what is there he never said 2 + 1 equal Tre but you have to figure it out and God does that Hallelujah he is you are here to be tested so he talk about a man of God that will stand tied with the Christ and bring that congregation under the condition where each member walks in the condition of this word seeing that word manifested these shine shall follow them not believe when when the fire fell when Peter spoke to Conor's house what did Peter said then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respected persons it was this experience that shocked Peter that that shake Peter because they were elected Jews these were stinking Gentiles if I could use that word filthy Gentiles Gentiles out of the Covenant of God and he went there with a testimony and when he dropped the testimony he see them filled with the same Holy Ghost they got not a different Holy Ghost not a lesser Holy Ghost not a small Holy Ghost not a tiny Holy Ghost not a gentile Holy Ghost and a Jewish holy ghost is the same Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God tonight it's the same Holy Ghost Hallelujah a truth God is no respect of persons but in every nation he that fav with him and work at righteousness is accepted with him hallelujah hallelujah and the Amplified it says Peter opened his mouth and said most certainly and thoroughly I now perceive and understand that God shows no pass ity and is no respect of persons but in every nation he who venerates and has the reverential fear of God treating him with worshipful obedience living uprightly is acceptable to him and sure of being received and welcomed by him oh Blessed Be you love him tonight oh glory to God so this was the burden that I get to share with you tonight Hallelujah glory to God in the beginning Genesis which is the SE chapter of the Bible we find when God made man he made him in the way he knew that he was to be he could never be any greater design than what he was when he made he begin to make life he made it from the lowest life and he went to the highest life is man within the image of God now here we go in this life listen closely man begin to achieve things but when he did he he begin to leave God out of the picture because he begin to have selfish motives this have to De with ambition and your achievement and I have seen it over the years people struggling and they and they're suffering and when God blessed them Pride take over arrogance that's why brother said this way he's looking for somebody that the more He blesses the more humble he becomes that is a rarity because when people get blessed they go into Pride mode they go into arrogant mode they go into nobody can tell them anything because they have money they have car they have house they have wealth they have plane they have jet they have whatever it is and they going to the do care mode they care about doctor they no nobody at all when he did that he begin to think of something for himself we find out it isn't long until he had corrupted the very planet that God put him on he had got in such a condition till even his creator grieved him at his heart that he ever make man and you you can imagine how God felt when he seen the very creature that he made in His image and give him dominion and how he made him to do something for him and yet he turned all his strength and his power over to selfish desires and achievements like have the computer with artificial intelligence now and they talking and talking back I say I tell tell somebody just s sit right that when they talking devil talking to you what I'm saying then when God put man and loose man man on the own you know and that is why man could achieve cars house current plane whatever it is it's man you know it's not it's not a spiritual man you know it's not a godly man you know is man in his intellect man in his mind man that was made in the image of God has the ability to achieve and he has we've seen it we are using man's achievement this microphone this technology this streaming all of this is man man in his element you think Elijah need techology when the I'm saying it have somebody hearing everything we saying Elijah don't need a wireless communication system Elijah hearing them talking privately don't tell nobody they making sure nobody looking and like hear everything normal normal normal because you see the dimensions is that's right there Dimensions is right there it have no space and time with God hallelujah but God Up Is Down Down is up Hallelujah Hal distance is nothing that's why he could give you a miracle tonight he could transform you tonight he could heal you tonight he could deliver you tonight he could free you tonight he could break the bands off of you tonight he could bless you tonight I'll say it again he could give you a miracle tonight he could give you new kidneys tonight H new heart tonight all right let's continue it seemed like man can't learn only through the hard way we find that even our children we have to punish them many times severely you can't see that now you know you're sining now to go there to make them understand it just seemed like a man is just in himself a total failure to begin with when he lost here we go his relationship with God he become a unit on his own and that's why people love the independence and as my own man as my own woman and whatnot like what people say it's my body and all kind foolishness like if they make it yourself they had to go to the manufacturer and who make your body who give you you who give you your eyes your nose your ears whatever it is you think you have and you own it just seemed like just a total failure when he lost his relationship with God he become a unit of his own here we go he didn't depend on God no more and that is why sometimes God has have us on a short leech that why some people can't get very far because he knew he know if you give them too much right now they destroy their own self so you have to hold them on a strong leave always Under Pressure that they could pray Under Pressure they could crou onto God If he if he give them too much right now forget it they they walk up they stop coming to church I know a brother praying for a car God he he want to come to church he want to get Transportation he want to get a car when you get a car he to church he going the beach you see why didn't all the time go trying to save him from himself because the car end up licking he going he stop going he L he going places he had become a unit of his own he didn't depend upon God no more and when God taught him the lesson of what it was to try to do something within himself and his Works will all come to nor immediately we find him going again to achieve again the Bible said they built them a tower they were going to climb into Heavens to get up into heaven without coming the way God planned for them so instead of repenting and getting right with God they say know something we so good we can build a tower and go right up and come we want go up we want Heen be far from us we going up to heaven and then start to build a tower listen I would say God get frighten you know but God said because the man is one they will achieve what the purpose in their heart that's how powerful Oneness is that's how powerful Unity is the only solution to answer that is to confuse them and God Dro different languages on them when they say Pastor brick somebody looking for the hammer the language different when they say put the gravel there somebody give a different language what he meant and the whole thing went nuts God had to stop man in his Track by sending different languages to confuse them and that's where the word Babylon come from confusion that's why we have mystery Babylon Madame confusion in this last day all right let's go and all the time these things are going on here we go the spirit of the Living God is traveling with flesh trying to get man away from his own achievement trying to get man away from his own selfish motives and objectives to a plan which God has laid down as long as man Works in his own plan he will be a failure a man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive that is according to God's plan for him any other Foundation is sinking sand you see Satan uses man's head he chooses in the garden even takes Man head he's thinking and he has brought that down even to the church the devil taken man's head because he can use his eye you notice if the man isn't generally Born Again spiritual he will take what he can see with his eyes the pride of life many men going to achieve something he wants to join a church he wants to be religious he look around till he find the biggest he can find because man wants to do something big he wants to make a big name for himself that's what the carnal foolish thinking man think oh if I could have my organization if I can only add so much thousands to my denomination it'll be the largest in the land what good does it do but he thinks he's achieving something because he's added and more those so-called meetings today they are great meetings but it only works on the intellectual part of man that's what happen in message right now people only intellectual getting the message they haven't got in contact with the real spirit yet and the brother Brandon prophesy When the Spirit Fall the elect will run to it the Spirit come in you know it Go and fall you know and the elect all the church members they will stay where they are but the elect they will follow that Spirit Hallelujah the spirit is what they're going to follow because that is where we come from before the beginning Satan only came in the beginning but the elect was before the beginning and in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was Spirit oh give the Lord some praises and we're going right back to before the beginning that's where our calling lies that's is where our election lies in the gene thought of God I was before the beginning here we go so watch the the So-Cal meetings the only reach in the works on the intellectual part of man a man gets under the spell of Revival yes I accept Christ but he does it intellectually because he in a great crowd he does it because there are great ministers before him it's only an intellectual conception that man can never go on he has got to come here we go listen he has got to come from the mind to his heart and be born again or he will never be able to stand the test because the test is coming as butan preach ready or not it's coming whether you are ready or not it's coming and all those people in Primary School know the test coming and the GC people know the test come in whether they ready or not you had 5 years to prepare 5 years to get enough sense in your head to do the exam and if you don't buckle down and settle down yourself to study you would fail who's to blame the question will be asked what have you done with your time it might have no cell phone had no thing you could scroll and WhatsApp and you call it again Tik Tok tock tick whatever it is and all these other social media thing had no social media you know social media when you see people outside hi hell hello than social media all time now we have all these distractions so you have to go and pass your distraction in order to say you know what I am here to waste time because I am working within time the temporary position God give us his time young person want to leave home want to run away run away to go away you're not home permanently one day you'll be out of the house home is just to make you prepared and be ready to face the real world home is a a controlled environment to help you in your home and people want to break out and they want to move out and all kind of stuff in that kind of a way but one day you'll be out could you manage yourself it's one thing to come out of Egypt you know afterward they couldn't manage yourself you know you know the first trial come they say let us go back to Egypt h no Graves out here all your following Moses take us back we miss them G they was roasting and onion and leaks brother bam almost finished you remember when the eye looks upon it the devil uses your eye in the Garden of Eden it Prov that the devil choose a head of man to work in but God chooses the heart when God comes to a man he comes to his heart let him believe and and let he let him believe things by his heart through faith that the eye does not see and that's why you know I'm going to get a breakthrough I know I'm going to get a victory I can't explain it but I just know it it's something inside my heart Hallelujah now when man has never had that experience he is still a Son of God in creation a fallen Son of God that's the reason he can take wood and make buildings he can take iron and make Machinery that's the reason that Elon Musk could do what he do because he's a man a fallen man Fallen son and because he have all his intellect and get all these ideas he could do something that other stist would only dream of and if time permits more people will come forward and do other things too because they actually have broken into God's laboratory these people are totally insane I read one of the AI thing they have right now they said it will take how much how much million years to be able to calculate what is calculating right now they hope the a start up on own do he can tell jewels and make watches what can he do he can take something out of the original creation and pervert it from his original to make something great but he cannot create only God can create we notice then Satan choosing the man's head he took his intellectual part oh now the church has begin to move into intellectual parts of man it's a great church we have a great denomination with the old in the country look at the history and we go to the history in the message and in 1970 and 19 this one and I all kind of History yeah God was in that history but where is God now we got to be careful you know because Saul was gifted Saul was anointed Saul was inspired one time Saul was even put with a line up with the prophets but afterwards Saul backslid and God rejected him so if he say God called me I could tell you the date the minute the hour he called me woo and I felt the anointing when that Prophet put all upon me yeah but that was 30 years ago what happening now what you feeling now you see what I'm saying now all right let that same man take his little knowledge he has in his head and give it to over to God let the spirit of the Living God come down into the heart of his he will call every word of God truth L watch there's a compartment in man's heart God made that in dear for him himself that is his control room he sits there to control you okay we on home shet right now that's his place that's where he sends his messages from the control room how can he work with you when your nature of the spirit of the devil is inside of there every man on Earth is born in sin shape and iniquity coming the world speaking lies so in the carnal adamic nature how can a man achieve anything only through his intellectuals so outside spirit of God bringing an operation in your heart is intellectuals at work when he comes to be a new creature and the old man passes out the new man Christ takes his throne in the human heart then life looks different then he starts on a new road from his own selfish motives till the big ideas to make himself something big he start right towards Calvary to recognize god listen to this then his all his objective his motive his ACH achievement all that he is lays at the glory of the Cross where Christ paid the price for human life Christ is our life now watch except a man be born again he can't even understand the kingdom of God you can't do it it's not in you to do it why did God make that little place he made it so you can be filled in there and the devil job now is to offer basketball football Cricket music hip hop whatever it is Tik Tok offer a set of stuff that to fill you instead of being filled with the Holy Ghost God put a compartment inside your heart not your head your heart that why the I see Styles I want that I want that kind of dress I want that kind of shoes I want that kind of life I want that kind of car I want that kind of plane I want want I want I want I want I want I want because the I seeing what you want but the heart want to believe what God said that's why God anoint the heart to believe what he said can I continue watch this part I've heard ministers get up with charts try to explain what the mark of the Beast was by some chart it doesn't take a chart the scripture say all that didn't receive the seed of God had the mark of the beast there are only two classes on the earth one's got the mark of God and the other one got the mark of the devil oh give the Lord some Praises all that didn't receive the mark of God had the mark of the devil that is what the scriptures said you are forced to make a decision let me grind it into you not to be rude or mean but to tell you the truth and warn you man's got to do something about it it is forced into you you must make your decision if I could show you by the word of God what the seed of the Living God is then you will know Ephesians 4:30 says that then without the Holy Spirit you are marked off the other side no matter how intellectual how many denominations that you belong to how much Pious religious you are Satan was the same thing Cain was religious as Abel did not Cain offer an offering just the same as Abel did not Cain build a church and Asel did did not Cain Get Down and Worship Asel did did not Cain sacrifice as same as Abel did but one come by intellectual conception brought flowers and fruits and they make it beautiful but Abel by faith choose a lamb it was blood and life that taken it and God confirmed Abel's Revelation oh give the Lord some Praises tonight let's go you are filled with something yes sir you might be filled with doubt mus please your poor heart may be running over with doubt I hope not your heart may be full of frats and worry it might be that your heart is full of trouble might be that you full of religion intellectual fine perfume theology belonging to a great churches be existence for years settling back just as confident you can be brother let me say it to you you might bring members to that church till you're old and die you will never do nothing but build another Tower of Babel certainly you can be full of foolishness people don't even know that full of it you can be full of nonsense I'm still reading they are my own thoughts you can be full of anything but you can't stay empty the Bible say you can't the Bible said when an unclean Spirit has gone of a man he walks in dry places searching rest and when he comes back with seven other Devils worse than he was the last state of the man is eight times worse than he was in the beginning that's what happened to these meetings when people go for in revivals and men are just led to an intellectual conception he goes off and joins some church and Let It Go as that satisfied there's nothing to all this nonsense we we shouldn't have it the pastor say oh that's well way back for another age and the first thing you know the devil return back with seven of devils and he become a religious devil then he's really filled he have pride and jealousy we are not like them we we are on the word we we are the message principle set a foolishness dead as a daill they up there don't sing message songs because I sing them just now the ones that are inspiring or what we will sing them don't worry he said now he's very angry and it's so cucko how people does take things to judge um the dress is not long enough our dress longer than their own that make them bright I don't put no grease in my hair that make them bright my hair dry for years that's bride oh my goodness we have Mysteries you all have nut that make them bride we play tapes and and press play that make them bride all these are lies am nice executive perfume theology lies the word have a requirement he said National Force put the people in work and churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride not hearing books not hearing tapes not going to the this church and that church the power of God have to put you in the bride God make sure he tell Gideon just watch them both sides but I will tell you who going to be with you oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah these s for believe not negative thinkers not intellectual church members but born again believer Bel who come from the intellectual to the heart where God takes control throne in his control room here this part to control your emotions to control your Fai to control your character let me read it again to control your emotions so how come the pastor or the minister or the man of God he is one way in the Pulpit but different way outside so you have big questions on his life on the outside but you have no question when he the preach cuz you're wory you got challenge that but then you have no Behavior outside but yet we are seen here that when God fills a man he controls your emotions he control your faith control your character God wants to fill you why does he want to fill you what does he want to fill you with he wants to fill you with himself the holy spirit filled with the Holy Ghost Jus said in Luke 24:49 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me oh my I'm closing in prayer tonight our heavenly father Master pray to the father that we be one and if and God is one how close were they God was the life and spirit in him and if we are one with him we will be life and spirit of him will be in us then Earthly carnal intellectual conception and Creeds and dogmas will fade out and a new generated born again virgin experience of the baptism of the holy spirit will take place in the human heart then you'll be one then brother will be really be brother sister will be sister your objectives your motives all that you are all that you ever want to be or try to be will be for the kingdom of God no matter what church you represent where you go or what you do oh prise when God sets in the Throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God fill you with love he fills you with power he fills you with his Spirit he fills you with his own divine nature he changes your carnal nature into his nature then you become a new creation in Christ then the love you go out and seemly the bird sing different when Christ comes come in and you look back and say how did I ever stay away from it everything is different you have no enemies they all look sweet you can forgive everything that en been done the bitterest of enemy you could pray for him on the street you could put armor around him and lift him up no matter what Creed what denomination belongs to he's a creature who Christ died for that is what God wants you to be filled with that's the filling that's the kingdom that is when we are one why because Abraham staggered not of the promise of God true unbelief but was strong giving praise to God why it wasn't in his mind it was in his heart God's Throne is in a human heart there we become one one in purpose one in achievement if a Methodist brother wins 100 Soul amen and amen because that is what we achieving the kingdom of God as long as you say well they are not Methodist they are not Baptist they are not this they are not the other your whole motive is wrong your objective all you achieve is wrong when you are trying to do something within yourself to make it look big when you are little oh give the Lord a praise in the house Hallelujah so all this thing I'm better than you and who is better and who is best and what that's just foolishness Jesus prayed we might be one just as God and him were one and God was in him begin to play and we are one with Christ if we let Christ come in but it's the only way we can do is to let him take the control in our hearts riches is not measured out by dollars riches is not measured by big names and popularity riches is connected with the kingdom of God father God I thank you tonight for your presence and your
