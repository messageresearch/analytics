[39:07] we confess we are needy people and we
[39:09] wait upon you
[39:11] in jesus name
[39:14] so god bless you if your bibles i'd like
[39:16] you to turn to sin john chapter one
[39:19] we want to read from verse 30 11 to 13.
[39:22] we want to read in john chapter 3
[39:25] we want one to eat and we want to read
[39:29] acts 1 verse 8. certainly appreciate
[39:33] the permitting and the exhortation on
[39:35] friday
[39:36] it was a tremendous blessing
[39:38] to you amen
[39:40] so reading from sin john 1
[39:42] we want to read from verse
[39:45] 11.
[39:46] he came unto his own and his own receive
[39:48] him not
[39:50] but as many as receive him
[39:52] to them give you power to become the
[39:54] sons of god even to them that believe on
[39:57] his name
[39:58] which were born
[40:00] not of blood
[40:03] which were born
[40:05] not of blood
[40:07] nor
[40:08] of the will of the flesh
[40:10] nor
[40:11] of the will of man
[40:13] but of god
[40:14] this is clear
[40:16] that this boot that he's talking about
[40:19] as many as receive him to them give you
[40:20] power to become the sons of god even to
[40:23] them that believe in his name which were
[40:24] born not of blood
[40:26] nor of the will of the flesh
[40:28] nor of the will of man
[40:30] but of god so in john chapter 3
[40:33] i want to read from verse 1 there was a
[40:34] man of the pharisees named nicodemus a
[40:37] ruler of the jews he came that came to
[40:39] jesus by night said unto him rabbi we
[40:42] know now what a teacher come from god
[40:44] for no man could do these miracles that
[40:46] now does
[40:48] except god be with him so nicodemus
[40:50] identified the miracles as the
[40:52] confirmation that this man is the
[40:53] teacher from god jesus answered himself
[40:55] to him very very less unto you except a
[40:58] man be born again he cannot see the
[41:01] kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him
[41:03] how can a man be born when he is old can
[41:06] he enter the second time into his
[41:07] mother's womb and be born and jesus
[41:10] answered verily verily i say unto thee
[41:13] except a man be born of the water and of
[41:16] the spirit he cannot enter into the
[41:19] kingdom of god
[41:20] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[41:23] that which is born of the spirit is
[41:24] spirit
[41:25] marvel not what i see unto thee you must
[41:28] be born again the wind blew it wait
[41:29] listed and thou hearst song thereof and
[41:32] can't not tell when's it cometh and
[41:34] whether it goes so is every man one that
[41:37] is born of the spirit last scripture
[41:39] acts 1 8
[41:40] but you shall receive power after the
[41:43] holy ghost has come upon you and you
[41:45] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[41:46] jerusalem in all judea in samaria on the
[41:49] uttermost part of the let's pray once
[41:51] more father we thank you for your word
[41:53] and these are scriptures laying here and
[41:54] take the holy spirit and make it alive
[41:56] make it real we invite you to come and
[41:58] breed
[41:59] upon the word lord
[42:01] and may the people's mind be taken up
[42:03] lord out of their own issues out of
[42:05] their own challenges i mean they hear
[42:08] the word as thus saith the lord this
[42:09] morning granted father and jesus may ask
[42:11] it amen our name and you may be seated
[42:13] and give the lord a shout and praise as
[42:15] you
[42:16] said donghan
[42:18] amen
[42:19] it's good to be here this morning it's
[42:21] good to be in the house of god
[42:23] i'm glad to see all of you out praise
[42:24] and even god
[42:26] are you ready for the word this morning
[42:28] praise god that's all we have to give
[42:29] just a word
[42:31] man shall live by bread alone and by
[42:33] philosophies and men's ideas but man
[42:35] shall live by the word that comes out of
[42:37] the mouth of god and the mouth of god
[42:39] are his prophets so regardless of what
[42:41] song nice and what song philosopher and
[42:43] what song good is the word alone of life
[42:46] because the word itself is spirit given
[42:48] or spirit spoken
[42:50] now man in his philosophical thinking
[42:52] whether it's confucius or buddha or
[42:53] whoever it is have nice talks and you
[42:55] know nice quotations and stuff that's
[42:57] from the human spirit that's some
[42:59] humanist realm because man was supposed
[43:01] to be a god man was supposed to be a
[43:04] certain realm so a man can still tap
[43:06] into certain things and certain
[43:07] principles but the word is god
[43:10] now the scripture we read this morning
[43:12] before that it says in the beginning was
[43:14] the word the word was with god and the
[43:17] word was god and the devil has tried to
[43:19] make it as if this would have no effect
[43:22] but men does twist the word that it
[43:24] doesn't have effect but the word itself
[43:26] is powerful it is sharper than the
[43:28] two-edged sword the world could come
[43:30] down and dissing you and design your
[43:33] knees and design your condition and
[43:35] minister to you this morning

[43:52] let a christian know find this with this
[43:54] scripture and that we have no problem

[44:13] you believe that
[44:14] our foundation is the bible we believe
[44:16] the bible to be in fatherhood of god of
[44:18] the living god we believe that
[44:19] everything that must that's done must
[44:22] come from the bible
[44:23] all teaching must be based on the bible
[44:26] now when the old testament had a way of
[44:28] knowing whether a prophet or a dreamer
[44:30] spoke the truth the other yeriman tamim
[44:32] many of you ministers you sunday school
[44:34] teachers know of it when a dreamer dream
[44:36] a dream or a prophet prophesy they had
[44:38] to take them to the temple and there was
[44:40] a breastplate that went over aaron's
[44:42] breasts and there was some birthstone of
[44:45] each head of the tribe of the 12th of
[44:47] israel and when this prophet was
[44:49] prophesying no matter how real his
[44:51] prophecy seemed to be if there wasn't a
[44:54] light
[44:55] that flashed over that a supernatural
[44:58] light while the prophet was prophesying
[45:00] they turned it down as wrong
[45:02] because it was god recognizing the
[45:04] prophet's prophecy
[45:06] so you said bring them into the temple
[45:07] you have a dream you have a prophecy
[45:09] come
[45:09] and say it in front of the breastplate
[45:12] of eren and you talk a dream and talk a
[45:14] dream if nothing happen they say forget
[45:16] about it keep on walking
[45:18] oh praise the name of the lord but when
[45:20] you speak that dream or speak that
[45:22] vision or speak that prophecy and a
[45:25] light start to glow around there they
[45:27] know that it's god because god himself
[45:29] is witnessing that this prophecy of
[45:32] vision comes from me oh glory to god
[45:34] hallelujah so god has sent his witness
[45:37] back the supernatural because god
[45:40] himself is supernatural oh glory to god
[45:42] so what you're looking for this morning
[45:44] is the supernatural witness to you
[45:47] praise god as a human being you can
[45:49] listen to another human being but we're
[45:51] not talking about human to human we're
[45:53] talking about what is born not of blood
[45:55] not of the will of man not for the will
[45:57] of the flesh but of god you must be born
[46:01] again or give the lord a shout born by
[46:04] the word and born by the spirit we have

[51:23] out why putin is as he is it because he
[51:25] rejected the holy ghost and god gives
[51:27] him over to a communist spirit that is
[51:29] why russia is where it is and they have
[51:31] satan one and satan two and all the

[52:06] [Music]
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:09] [Music]
[52:11] let me be seated
[52:12] did you notice it was always done by the
[52:15] supernatural god is supernatural where
[52:17] god is supernatural things take place
[52:18] and if god has always been supernatural
[52:20] he always will be supernatural
[52:23] therefore but the supernatural must be
[52:26] vindicated by god
[52:27] because there's all kind of mysticism
[52:29] there's all kind of different theories
[52:31] and sensations everything in the world
[52:33] today by the midst of it all there still
[52:35] remains are true
[52:37] and living god
[52:39] here we go
[52:40] if israel 2000 years ago would accept
[52:42] the invitation that they were given
[52:44] they wouldn't be where they are today
[52:46] two thousand years ago israel turned on
[52:48] the invitation to come to the wedding
[52:51] supper they turned it down and went into
[52:53] judgment but jesus said this stone
[52:55] killed the prophets that was sent to
[52:57] them by making excuses
[52:59] the excuses they made in each day now
[53:01] when jesus he didn't affiliate with any
[53:03] of them
[53:04] when did this man get his learning what
[53:06] school did he was from is not the
[53:08] carpenter's son isn't his mother called
[53:10] mary his brother joseph and james and so
[53:13] forth isn't his sisters with us then
[53:15] where did this man get this authority to
[53:16] do this thing in other words he didn't
[53:18] affiliate with them so they said he's
[53:20] baseball he's a samaritan he's got a
[53:22] devil he's mad he's a man that's got an
[53:24] evil spirit on the line of religion that
[53:26] drove him crazy
[53:29] he's out there like a wild man
[53:31] don't pay
[53:33] any attention to him we know what
[53:35] happened to israel they screamed out and
[53:37] he says let his blood be upon us and
[53:40] upon our children
[53:41] you see our words are powerful
[53:43] that's what they cry out let his blood
[53:45] be upon us
[53:46] and our children and they blight
[53:49] themselves for generation and god
[53:51] scattered them
[53:53] throughout all the world
[53:55] with the prophecy
[53:56] that in the last days he's going to
[53:58] bring them back
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] so that is why the palestinians and them
[54:04] was there for hundreds of years
[54:07] and when israel started to come back
[54:08] 1946 and the 40s they'd come like like
[54:10] if they have a deed for the land
[54:12] and they say we're coming back for home
[54:14] that's why they've packed us up you know
[54:16] because it's abraham's sons
[54:19] through ishmael and isaac
[54:21] it can't stop now
[54:23] this battle started way back in genesis
[54:25] you can't expect it to stop now
[54:27] and god cut off israel to connect with
[54:30] us
[54:30] so now we're going to cut off the
[54:32] gentiles to connect back with israel
[54:34] or give the lord a shout
[54:37] right now we have one million jews in
[54:39] ukraine

[54:58] are sealed

[55:24] i didn't know nothing about god nothing
[55:26] about this word but this message for me
[55:29] and it's the best thing god could have
[55:31] set my way
[55:32] now i know i'm not a baptist i'm not a
[55:34] methodist i'm not a catholic i'm a son
[55:36] of god
[55:38] he came unto his own
[55:40] his own rejected him
[55:42] the jews rejected him and then they
[55:44] turned to the gentiles and we received
[55:46] him and as many as receive him who is

[1:01:23] jump of communism and solo to the devil
[1:01:26] fifty years ago the holy ghost fell in
[1:01:29] england
[1:01:30] fell
[1:01:33] the message don't talk about that now
[1:01:35] there's only words and mysteries i'm
[1:01:37] talking about the holy ghost fell
[1:01:40] i know mystery for long enough
[1:01:42] because you said my words are
[1:01:44] spirit and my words are life so the word
[1:01:47] is also spirit
[1:01:48] spirit is also word so you can get word
[1:01:51] spirit in word form but word is also
[1:01:54] spirit so when he said the holy ghost
[1:01:55] fell in russia what is he talking about
[1:01:58] when he said the holy ghost fell in
[1:01:59] england what is he talking about while
[1:02:01] the holy ghost has to fall in trinidad
[1:02:03] what is he talking about
[1:02:05] kept the lord i shouted in the host
[1:02:07] when we said the holy ghost going to
[1:02:08] fall and treated that what are we
[1:02:11] talking about that has nothing to do
[1:02:13] with no man
[1:02:15] nothing to do with no minister
[1:02:18] no a person not prophet no evangelist no
[1:02:21] teacher no pastor
[1:02:24] that has to be the holy ghost itself
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:32] 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in
[1:02:33] england just after africa and that after
[1:02:36] that come george jeffrey's ff buzzword
[1:02:38] charles price smith wiggles wood those
[1:02:41] great wires of the faith 50 years ago
[1:02:43] and offered england the holy ghost
[1:02:45] revival what did they do they laugh at
[1:02:47] them put them in jail call them crazy
[1:02:50] thought they had lost their minds the
[1:02:51] churches refused the people to come hear
[1:02:53] them and they healed the sick the castle
[1:02:55] devils done great works and because
[1:02:57] england as a nation rejected the gospel
[1:02:59] her sins is known throughout all the
[1:03:01] world there is hardly a more apostate
[1:03:03] nation in all the world including roman
[1:03:05] france
[1:03:06] than england
[1:03:07] she's the mother of apostasy
[1:03:10] that english spirit
[1:03:11] mother of apostasy right where finney
[1:03:14] and many of the great men preached and
[1:03:16] he market and charles finney and wesley
[1:03:18] all done she turned it on
[1:03:21] america 15 years ago

[1:07:43] when the holy ghost poorer than russia
[1:07:45] they was called to the feast of

[1:08:01] the table has got to be set the table is
[1:08:03] ready there is still more room and i
[1:08:06] believe whether his next few months or
[1:08:07] something or a year whatever it is god
[1:08:09] is going to send another shaking across
[1:08:10] the country because there is still
[1:08:12] somebody out there
[1:08:14] if all these years we covered books
[1:08:15] voice of god god tons of books in
[1:08:17] english friends spanish all kind of
[1:08:18] language and what that that is shaking
[1:08:20] nothing
[1:08:21] they're just books going out
[1:08:23] the shaking coming when the holy ghost
[1:08:25] began to move in power
[1:08:27] god can't read people can't reject what
[1:08:29] they haven't seen
[1:08:31] manifested he came unto his own his own
[1:08:33] receive him not jesus come just talking
[1:08:36] no he said his spirit is upon me
[1:08:38] for he had anointed me
[1:08:40] to preach this gospel
[1:08:42] every time they're hearing word word
[1:08:44] word from the pharisees he come and said
[1:08:45] the spirit is now upon me
[1:08:47] hallelujah to pray in other words to
[1:08:49] fulfill what only reading all these
[1:08:50] years this prayer is upon me today
[1:08:53] to fulfill what you're reading
[1:08:55] then he said this day this scripture i
[1:08:57] don't have to wait

[1:09:00] this day
[1:09:01] what you hear reading here
[1:09:03] is fulfilling your ears
[1:09:07] then they push him out
[1:09:09] and he becomes the rejected stone and
[1:09:11] then he's going to cast our devils he's
[1:09:13] got to heal the sick he's got to raise
[1:09:15] the dead and the devil was mad because
[1:09:17] when jesus did that he was exposing
[1:09:19] satan's invisible kingdom
[1:09:24] did you hear that
[1:09:25] he was exposing the kingdom of the devil
[1:09:30] because the devil was hiding behind

[1:09:34] teachers and false doctrines and all
[1:09:36] them along wrote people hiding behind
[1:09:38] humor and blindness and death so when

[1:09:54] world know we're in the realm of the
[1:09:55] spirit now

[1:10:02] intellectual powers spirit business

[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:34] all right let's go
[1:11:35] the same holy ghost that fell under
[1:11:37] pentecost which we all know that was the
[1:11:39] bullet of the new church
[1:11:41] if
[1:11:42] that same holy spirit don't bring the
[1:11:44] same experience to you
[1:11:45] then you've got a different holy spirit
[1:11:48] than what that was
[1:11:49] well i'll receive it when i receive the
[1:11:51] word yeah the baptist
[1:11:53] are message baptists
[1:11:56] if the same holy spirit don't bring the
[1:11:58] same experience to you then you got a
[1:12:01] different holy spirit than what that was
[1:12:03] exactly
[1:12:04] if it don't make you live a sacrificial
[1:12:07] life
[1:12:08] and a life of full of joy and pleasure
[1:12:10] and the baptist spirit leading you into
[1:12:12] signing one of the miracles and things
[1:12:14] something happened jesus said these
[1:12:16] signs shall form you fall in and i
[1:12:18] believe
[1:12:19] samuel here we go i'd prove that he was
[1:12:22] a civilian of god
[1:12:23] he proved that the holy spirit was with
[1:12:25] him
[1:12:26] and he said i'll take you record to this
[1:12:28] day have i exposed anything to you in
[1:12:29] the name of the lord what will welcome
[1:12:31] the past
[1:12:32] you know why this was addressed right
[1:12:34] they saw they tell samuel this is israel
[1:12:36] telling samuel all the nations have a
[1:12:38] man in front of them
[1:12:39] leading them in the battle
[1:12:41] we want a man
[1:12:44] and samuel
[1:12:45] grieve he's oh god will you
[1:12:48] are you gonna ask for that
[1:12:50] you different from other nations
[1:12:53] god is a king you say but we have a man
[1:12:54] in front of you
[1:12:56] riding horse
[1:12:58] big bomberman thing that is women
[1:13:03] so simon i tell them have i said
[1:13:04] anything in the name of the lord but
[1:13:06] welcome the past how do i come and beg
[1:13:08] and bomb money from you all these things
[1:13:10] they said no
[1:13:11] you haven't done that but we want to
[1:13:13] have it the way we want it
[1:13:16] and then god told samuel they have not
[1:13:18] rejected you
[1:13:19] they rejected me
[1:13:21] hallelujah we find out here we go
[1:13:24] when a man rejects
[1:13:27] the leading of the holy spirit you know
[1:13:29] what god did for saul
[1:13:31] he gave him an evil spirit to lead him
[1:13:37] now how about that
[1:13:39] he give him an evil spirit god give him
[1:13:43] an evil spirit to lead him
[1:13:45] so when a man rejects
[1:13:48] the legion of the holy spirit or any
[1:13:50] person
[1:13:52] rejects
[1:13:53] the leading of the holy spirit you've
[1:13:55] got a devil on you to lead you
[1:13:58] and when he said lead he mean
[1:14:00] legionnaire
[1:14:01] follow me
[1:14:05] a devil to direct you
[1:14:08] if a man is led by the spirit of god
[1:14:11] god will make himself known to that
[1:14:12] person god promised so in doing that we
[1:14:16] know that the holy spirit leads the
[1:14:18] people and go take care of it
[1:14:20] i'd like to say another thing you've
[1:14:21] seen it again
[1:14:23] that evil spirit began to lead soul
[1:14:26] it led him
[1:14:28] and today
[1:14:29] when the holy spirit is rejected
[1:14:32] it wants what will it do you will get an
[1:14:35] evil spiritually you know listen i don't
[1:14:37] want to hurt you i want you to get this
[1:14:39] just as it was in them days so it is
[1:14:41] today they don't want the holy spirit to
[1:14:44] lead them so they get an evil spirit
[1:14:47] what takes place with an evil spirit the
[1:14:48] evil spirit wants to lead them and know
[1:14:51] what they don't want god to be their
[1:14:53] judge
[1:14:54] and people today don't want the holy
[1:14:56] spirit to judge them and that's the
[1:14:58] reason they turn samuel down because his
[1:15:00] judgment was of god it was scriptural
[1:15:03] they don't want to be led by the spirit
[1:15:05] and they turn it down for an ecclasical
[1:15:07] man what did they get an evil spirit to
[1:15:10] lead them
[1:15:12] if they don't want the holy spirit to
[1:15:13] judge them
[1:15:14] no excuses god won't listen to your
[1:15:16] excuses he didn't listen to saul he
[1:15:18] would listen to you you have got to
[1:15:21] compare with what the bible says i'll
[1:15:23] hear this bomb
[1:15:24] god knows what's truth what is best
[1:15:27] samuel tried to tell saul that
[1:15:30] god knows what is best but saul said
[1:15:33] well the people want me
[1:15:38] but when someone will come and say i
[1:15:39] hear blitzing in the back there i
[1:15:41] thought they were supposed to kill
[1:15:42] everything he said well you know what i
[1:15:43] mean i keep the best for the lord
[1:15:46] best for the people you know the people
[1:15:49] watch this
[1:15:51] as long as he could get somebody to
[1:15:54] follow him
[1:15:55] so
[1:15:56] that's what he wanted
[1:15:58] he used samuel's name
[1:16:00] and get somebody to follow him that's
[1:16:02] all he wanted
[1:16:04] and today they're used by the brahman
[1:16:05] name
[1:16:08] and get people to follow them
[1:16:10] but they're not preaching by the
[1:16:11] banner's message
[1:16:13] they're preaching their own revelation
[1:16:15] their own thoughts their own ideas their
[1:16:17] own inspiration and yet that prophecy
[1:16:19] say with the tipsy
[1:16:23] because that i say in it
[1:16:25] it's him that is saying it
[1:16:27] the words are spirit given words
[1:16:29] that's why we are resting on the
[1:16:30] prophetic utterance
[1:16:32] that was released by malachi 4.
[1:16:34] i could rest my soul on that
[1:16:37] well i could give you that and no i give
[1:16:39] you dust say of the lord
[1:16:41] oh glory to god let me read it again
[1:16:43] as long as he gets somebody to follow
[1:16:45] him that's all he wanted he used
[1:16:47] samuel's name and get somebody to follow
[1:16:49] him that's what he wanted they don't
[1:16:52] want to read it the real gospel
[1:16:54] they don't want the real truth they
[1:16:56] don't want the holy spirit to guide them
[1:16:58] they'd rather have an intellectual
[1:16:59] pastor
[1:17:00] with seminary experience of the uh
[1:17:03] on a theological experience seminary
[1:17:06] experience instead of the baptism of the
[1:17:07] holy ghost done in him
[1:17:09] to make him shock the height off
[1:17:11] oh my so let me wrap up this part here i
[1:17:14] will continue so when god sent the holy
[1:17:17] ghost
[1:17:18] and knocks at a man's door
[1:17:20] and he deliberately turns it down
[1:17:23] so it means god has come knocking yes
[1:17:26] i want to fill you
[1:17:28] he said he want to fill you more than
[1:17:30] you want to receive the feeling
[1:17:32] hallelujah god when he sends the holy
[1:17:34] ghost and looks on a man's door and the
[1:17:36] liberty is down sometimes you're going
[1:17:37] to turn it on for this last time
[1:17:39] and you won't be a privileged character
[1:17:41] you can set in church
[1:17:43] listen to the gospel
[1:17:45] agree with the gospel you might do so
[1:17:47] much and say i know it's right but never
[1:17:49] put a finger on it to help yourself you

[1:20:39] in isaiah 61 the scripture declares the
[1:20:42] spirit is upon me so he was real himself
[1:20:45] he was reading his own scripture

[1:20:50] his fulfillment their thought was
[1:20:51] another text

[1:20:57] happening right now
[1:21:01] watch

[1:21:14] spirit the spirit of god led him
[1:21:16] into the wilderness to manage lucifer
[1:21:19] because only three things lucifer could
[1:21:21] tackle it lust of the eyes
[1:21:24] lust of the flesh and the pride of life

[1:26:25] lord
[1:26:29] doesn't matter what you have done or
[1:26:31] will
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:34] do this is too much for me right now
[1:26:39] i'm on expectation now myself i've seen
[1:26:41] a shaken power come that will shake
[1:26:43] donations pretty soon
[1:26:45] god can ever get a people under his own
[1:26:48] control
[1:26:49] if he would get a man or woman that
[1:26:51] won't compromise on his word and will
[1:26:53] stand there like the rocker ages i'll
[1:26:55] believe every word of it and believe it
[1:26:57] that he's behind it a man who believes
[1:26:59] it you must act like it
[1:27:01] if you don't act like it then you don't
[1:27:03] believe it so if you're starting to line
[1:27:05] up with the word and believe the word
[1:27:06] act like it
[1:27:08] act
[1:27:09] like it
[1:27:10] if you want a revival create an
[1:27:12] atmosphere that god could meet you your
[1:27:14] praise and god in advance
[1:27:16] not because you do have problems you
[1:27:18] know but because you're showing god
[1:27:19] faith
[1:27:20] that you believe
[1:27:21] he's going to work it out
[1:27:24] everybody have problems including me
[1:27:27] not one is escape of problems
[1:27:29] challenges
[1:27:30] but your prayer is god
[1:27:32] because god's going to work it out
[1:27:35] glory to god nobody looking for trial
[1:27:38] nobody looking for sickness nobody
[1:27:39] looking for a correlation i said come
[1:27:41] i'm waiting for you nobody doing that
[1:27:44] but sometimes the winds blow contrary
[1:27:46] oh give the lord some praises
[1:27:48] it's not because you're sin it's not
[1:27:50] because you do this and do that
[1:27:51] sometimes the winds just blow contrary
[1:27:53] what do you do when the winds are going
[1:27:55] contrary god give us that voice peace be
[1:27:58] still
[1:28:00] oh help me somebody
[1:28:02] hallelujah
[1:28:04] all right
[1:28:05] and a man who believes it you must act
[1:28:07] like it if you don't act like it then
[1:28:09] you don't believe it but if you believe
[1:28:10] it act like it and you can put it to
[1:28:12] work and the word will be in you we lost
[1:28:15] all her in heritage because we
[1:28:17] compromise when we compromise we cannot
[1:28:19] expect god to keep his promise to us
[1:28:22] because we broke in upon a sacred trust
[1:28:26] and defile the trust that god has given
[1:28:28] us
[1:28:30] let us keep that trust
[1:28:31] keep it sacred keep it holy
[1:28:34] keep every word of it and compromise
[1:28:36] nowhere take god at his word and believe
[1:28:39] it act like it stand in it don't move
[1:28:41] that's what we must do that is what god
[1:28:43] is looking for
[1:28:44] church do you understand what god's
[1:28:45] looking for
[1:28:47] because i was still locked into the wood
[1:28:48] and said god you said so i'm not
[1:28:50] compromising with it i'm holding to it
[1:28:55] what we need today is not pray for more
[1:28:56] power
[1:28:58] the flip side of it now
[1:29:00] you got enough power to make a new earth
[1:29:02] what you need is faith to use that power
[1:29:06] what you need is is to control that life
[1:29:09] and live such a godly life that when you
[1:29:11] ask god anything you know we have
[1:29:13] confidence we know if we keep his
[1:29:15] commandments he withhold no good thing
[1:29:16] from us
[1:29:20] because of what the controlled life
[1:29:23] they had one thing to do he said what
[1:29:26] um what they they had but one thing to
[1:29:28] do they had but one thing to do stay
[1:29:29] straight on course not one over here one
[1:29:32] over there but still of course the
[1:29:33] church has got one thing to do stay on
[1:29:36] the course had a pillar of fire they had
[1:29:38] to keep themselves in course by
[1:29:39] following the pillar of fire that's what
[1:29:41] led them the object was they could see
[1:29:43] the pillar fire they were they seen as
[1:29:45] working through moses they know he was
[1:29:47] the leader today we got the word we
[1:29:49] follow the word we see the word working
[1:29:50] on the believers we know it so god is
[1:29:52] working with us confirming the word with
[1:29:54] signs following we stay with the word
[1:29:56] the word produces results
[1:29:59] and here what i've told you about i was
[1:30:01] going to read for you
[1:30:02] now
[1:30:03] now what could we do if we can realize
[1:30:05] and find out that jesus is still alive
[1:30:07] if we find out what
[1:30:09] that jesus is still alive why today we
[1:30:11] go to service we act like we're going to
[1:30:12] a funeral service instead
[1:30:16] like you're going to pay under the dead
[1:30:18] instead of worshiping and healing a
[1:30:19] conqueror
[1:30:22] you see what god in the message no i
[1:30:24] said that dead people you passed that
[1:30:26] dead and people did too
[1:30:28] it's a funeral
[1:30:30] a funeral and under the funeral against
[1:30:32] mysteries
[1:30:34] christ conquered debt he conquered hell
[1:30:37] he conquered a grave he conquered sin he
[1:30:40] conquered sickness we are healing a
[1:30:42] conqueror
[1:30:43] not somebody died thousands of years ago
[1:30:45] that live a good life but christ has
[1:30:46] raised again is the same yesterday to
[1:30:48] the end forever
[1:30:49] so when you come to church you come to
[1:30:51] worship and i live in christ
[1:30:53] a resurrected christ you come to honor
[1:30:56] him
[1:30:56] by saying lord i worship you i believe
[1:30:58] you you are here now
[1:31:00] the prophet is gone but the angel ain't
[1:31:01] gone
[1:31:02] the prophet gone by the spirit ain't
[1:31:04] gone
[1:31:05] oh give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:31:08] glory
[1:31:09] could we take some more
[1:31:11] all right no
[1:31:13] when jesus rose from the dead notice
[1:31:15] before he died he was feeling a
[1:31:17] multitude and preaching to thousands and
[1:31:19] thousands and multiplying bread and fish
[1:31:21] and so on but when he rose from the dead
[1:31:23] he did not appear to the people in
[1:31:24] public
[1:31:26] with a private ministry to his elect
[1:31:29] to the believers okay
[1:31:31] what he inside closed doors he did
[1:31:33] something that to make them know it was
[1:31:35] he
[1:31:36] after talking with them all day long
[1:31:38] hearing him preach for three years he
[1:31:40] was on it then after resurrection
[1:31:42] hearing him preach and did not recognize
[1:31:43] him until he did something
[1:31:46] so he was among them
[1:31:48] and they didn't recognize him
[1:31:50] until he did something
[1:31:53] could you imagine that
[1:31:55] they live and walk with this man for
[1:31:56] three and a half years he died rose from
[1:31:58] the dead among them and they didn't know
[1:31:59] jesus
[1:32:01] listen to what the prophet said now this
[1:32:02] is beautiful
[1:32:03] isn't it strange thing
[1:32:05] that it takes something on the side of
[1:32:07] the supernatural
[1:32:09] to make us understand that it's him that
[1:32:12] teaching itself won't do it
[1:32:16] so i don't understand the lust for all
[1:32:17] these teachers
[1:32:20] the bible talk about the last days
[1:32:21] people have itching ears
[1:32:23] for new revelations
[1:32:25] and they will keep to themselves
[1:32:26] teachers because you see in your mind
[1:32:28] intellectually you want an explanation
[1:32:30] for why this happened why this happened
[1:32:31] what is happening why are you moving so
[1:32:33] why putin move into white people why are
[1:32:35] you ukraine why this and why this all
[1:32:36] the wise
[1:32:37] and the question about why you having
[1:32:39] the holy ghost yet do you want to talk
[1:32:40] about it
[1:32:42] why we don't have power we're not
[1:32:43] talking about it
[1:32:44] we're talking about england russia
[1:32:46] there's that the trilateral council
[1:32:50] illuminati
[1:32:52] the gold standard we could go on and on
[1:32:55] and on
[1:32:56] and all our room doing and already lgbtq
[1:32:58] doing and what are we doing
[1:33:00] what we doing
[1:33:03] what are we doing
[1:33:05] they're doing their do what are we doing
[1:33:07] saddam was having a great time you know
[1:33:09] salam was saddam you know
[1:33:11] god appeared to abraham and break some
[1:33:13] sea you say abraham that he gonna judge
[1:33:15] him
[1:33:16] god concerned was about luck and his
[1:33:18] family down in saddam
[1:33:19] lot didn't understand his decision would
[1:33:21] affect his family that way
[1:33:23] he thought was his own choice and
[1:33:25] decision and so on he didn't see there
[1:33:27] were secondary consequences to his
[1:33:29] decisions
[1:33:30] and many times you don't look far enough
[1:33:32] to see the consequences of our decisions
[1:33:34] secondary consequences
[1:33:37] lord had gumption he had ancient yet
[1:33:39] gumption the colon righteous man and so
[1:33:41] on like that
[1:33:42] but then when abraham said lord if there
[1:33:44] are ten righteous we do the truth he
[1:33:45] said no
[1:33:46] and abram acting under the spirit of
[1:33:48] christ and deceit for his brethren
[1:33:50] because he had a burden
[1:33:52] do you have a burden
[1:33:53] there's some person i've been listening
[1:33:55] to they like like a feather
[1:33:57] if you breathe take them to float away
[1:33:59] don't be like that you know get a burden
[1:34:01] get a burden
[1:34:03] because burden pushes you into prayer a
[1:34:05] burden pushes you to help others a
[1:34:07] burden pushes you to reach out
[1:34:09] without a burden you just go very light
[1:34:12] some people never burn for themselves
[1:34:15] which is selfishness
[1:34:18] but a burden extends beyond you
[1:34:21] hallelujah i go to the lost sheep of the
[1:34:23] house of israel a burden to get the word
[1:34:25] out a burden to witness they love one of
[1:34:27] our burden for your family and loved
[1:34:28] ones
[1:34:30] look
[1:34:31] lot
[1:34:32] a hills man treat abram who is meant
[1:34:34] ruffiano
[1:34:35] lot made a decision to pitch his time to
[1:34:37] watch southern you know so it's not that
[1:34:38] abraham had it so easy and the end of
[1:34:41] the day even though lot made a decision
[1:34:43] and got himself in trouble abraham is he
[1:34:44] one who bring deliverance
[1:34:47] abraham is the one who pleads on behalf
[1:34:48] of a god and say please plea on behalf
[1:34:51] of lot and then because of abraham
[1:34:52] pleading god can send angels down there
[1:34:56] oh glory to god angels and brother isaac
[1:34:58] bring it out
[1:34:59] mrs lott heard the angel testimony heard
[1:35:02] what has been preached heard of being
[1:35:03] said and she choose to look back
[1:35:10] choice
[1:35:12] what overthrow her own heart
[1:35:14] the lust that was in her heart
[1:35:17] all what what that giveaway just don't
[1:35:19] look back
[1:35:20] oh my hallelujah so watch so watch let's
[1:35:24] say again isn't it strange that it takes
[1:35:25] something on the side of supernatural to
[1:35:27] make us understand it is him
[1:35:29] that teaching itself won't do it he
[1:35:32] never commissioned his church to go and
[1:35:33] teach the word
[1:35:35] he said preach the gospel
[1:35:37] or
[1:35:38] or
[1:35:39] manifest the gospel people don't like to
[1:35:42] talk about that
[1:35:44] they find we're not talking mysteriously
[1:35:45] enough our brother tell me already are
[1:35:46] not deep enough
[1:35:48] i said god lord help me jesus is he pray
[1:35:50] for me right i pray for me
[1:35:51] i really want to get deep
[1:35:54] but he said not to teach the word but
[1:35:56] preach the gospel or manifest the gospel
[1:35:58] and the gospel comes not in word only
[1:36:00] but to the power and demonstration of
[1:36:02] the spirit
[1:36:03] now in truth there's the teaching part
[1:36:05] of the word and the manifestation part
[1:36:07] of the word
[1:36:08] or teaching is the seed part of the word
[1:36:10] and the gospel is the spirit part of the
[1:36:12] word
[1:36:13] both are the same
[1:36:14] one you have to have seed
[1:36:16] so jesus said that you must be born
[1:36:17] again of
[1:36:19] the word and the spirit or the water and
[1:36:22] the spirit or the word and the spirit is
[1:36:24] saying to you you have to be born again
[1:36:26] of the incorruptible seed of the word
[1:36:28] and when you get the word in you then
[1:36:30] the spirit come behind that to bring
[1:36:32] that word alive
[1:36:36] you have to put a pumpkin seed on your
[1:36:38] you have a hose of water waiting ground
[1:36:40] expecting pumpkin you know what you're
[1:36:41] expecting right
[1:36:45] he's making grass to grow on that
[1:36:47] to get pumpkin you have to put seed in
[1:36:49] there
[1:36:51] the seed is not the pumpkin
[1:36:53] the seed has the potential to produce
[1:36:55] pumpkin
[1:36:56] but the seeds have all the things in it
[1:36:59] the seed has to go in the ground
[1:37:01] well the seed is the word
[1:37:03] he said the word is a seed
[1:37:05] and the seeds are coming to you
[1:37:07] god know you were born in shape iniquity
[1:37:09] that is why you say you must be born
[1:37:11] again
[1:37:12] we are old seed
[1:37:14] or life
[1:37:15] born in sin and new seeds have to be
[1:37:18] introduced into us
[1:37:19] to start a spiritual work or a
[1:37:21] supernatural work the word have to come
[1:37:23] into you
[1:37:24] and then that word become to turn into
[1:37:26] spirit
[1:37:27] and then you have the holy ghost
[1:37:29] or give the lord or the kingdom
[1:37:32] glory to god so therefore the preaching
[1:37:34] the gospel is to manifest the word isn't
[1:37:36] that right
[1:37:37] let's continue now now
[1:37:39] let me skip there
[1:37:42] jesus i'm overcomer i'm the one that
[1:37:43] come to give life and through my debt to
[1:37:46] pay the penalty of what you've done to
[1:37:48] my life will be given to you to flow
[1:37:51] over you and you'll be sons and
[1:37:53] daughters of god
[1:37:54] as long as the seed isn't there
[1:37:58] so jesus was saying i come to die and
[1:38:00] pay the price for ease i breathing that
[1:38:03] my spirit life can flow over you
[1:38:06] to make you into a son of god as long as
[1:38:10] the seed is in there
[1:38:11] what's the secret
[1:38:13] the word is in the bride
[1:38:15] so the secret is god put the word in you
[1:38:18] and the devil don't know nothing about
[1:38:19] it
[1:38:21] because he cannot go into your heart to
[1:38:22] see what god put inside of you
[1:38:24] oh give the lord a shout
[1:38:27] he could mess with your spirit mess with
[1:38:28] your flesh he can't mess with your soul
[1:38:31] because that is where you put that seed
[1:38:33] give the lord a shout in the earth
[1:38:36] that is why god have confidence in you
[1:38:38] not so much you but the seed in you give
[1:38:40] the lord some praises on that
[1:38:42] let me drop the bomb on you one time you
[1:38:44] are not the believer
[1:38:46] the word in you
[1:38:48] is the believer
[1:38:50] so the word in you is believing god's
[1:38:52] own word
[1:38:53] god himself put it inside of you not
[1:38:55] your father not your mother not your
[1:38:57] uncle not your husband not your wife god
[1:38:59] put that inside of you
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:05] here we go
[1:39:07] this is important
[1:39:08] all of god's sons
[1:39:11] must be the same way
[1:39:13] to be born of the word and spirit
[1:39:16] brings us back to spoken word again
[1:39:19] hallelujah
[1:39:21] so god said let us make man imagine like
[1:39:23] this
[1:39:24] image and likeness spoken word son adam

[1:40:00] it again just like god spoke for adam i
[1:40:02] must speak for your son let there be set
[1:40:06] let there be a bell
[1:40:07] evils to conceive
[1:40:09] by spoken word
[1:40:11] to produce a baby
[1:40:13] oh glory to god but because we fell it
[1:40:16] fell into sex
[1:40:18] hallelujah but it was supposed to be
[1:40:20] spoken word
[1:40:21] but when jesus came he said you must be
[1:40:24] born again
[1:40:25] by the word
[1:40:27] by the spirit
[1:40:29] you must
[1:40:31] another suggestion
[1:40:33] you must

[1:41:06] to be born of the wood and spirit
[1:41:09] brings us back to the spoken word again
[1:41:12] like in john 3
[1:41:14] so he tied it with the script that we
[1:41:15] read
[1:41:16] to be born of the water and the spirit
[1:41:18] what does it do it brings you right back
[1:41:21] into the place where you should have
[1:41:22] been at the beginning
[1:41:24] that's why we're going back into adamic
[1:41:26] state

[1:41:29] we're going back to before there was a

[1:41:31] that is why you use the word justified
[1:41:34] justified as if you never did it
[1:41:37] only god could justify you
[1:41:39] it is god that justify it who is he that
[1:41:42] condemn it

[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:35] anytime you're ready for it we can have
[1:52:36] it
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:50] okay
[1:52:51] to be born of the water and spirit
[1:52:54] what does it do
[1:52:55] then it brings you right back into the
[1:52:58] place where you should have been at the
[1:53:00] beginning
[1:53:02] that's the reason of christ's debt it
[1:53:04] brings us right back again to where sons
[1:53:06] of god
[1:53:08] hallelujah
[1:53:09] and that's the way any person
[1:53:11] claims to believe god
[1:53:13] don't believe his word we'll take our
[1:53:14] inaudible creed and breathe with the
[1:53:15] word
[1:53:16] you are not of god
[1:53:18] you are dead you can't be dead in our
[1:53:19] life at the same time
[1:53:20] so even the word of god don't even grow
[1:53:23] you're just playing the part of a
[1:53:24] hypocrite
[1:53:25] let it go for bishop priest cardinal who
[1:53:27] it might be it's got to be the word or
[1:53:29] you are dead
[1:53:31] we notice the spoken word
[1:53:33] then we are god's word made manifest
[1:53:36] that's
[1:53:36] how god wants his church
[1:53:39] to manifest himself
[1:53:41] not manifest to you
[1:53:43] not manifest his own tabernacle we have
[1:53:45] nothing to do with that
[1:53:47] what god wants to do is manifest himself
[1:53:49] it is back to sins we would see jesus
[1:53:54] not see this church
[1:53:55] this church is not what god's coming to
[1:53:57] see
[1:53:58] he want to see himself
[1:54:00] that's why he said this being this
[1:54:01] faithful knowledge when it's completed
[1:54:04] it's the servant of god
[1:54:06] in the church of god that's going in the
[1:54:09] rapture
[1:54:10] it could also be said this way
[1:54:12] if this is not completed
[1:54:15] he will be part of the tribulation says
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:20] the minister is not going to the rapture
[1:54:22] without that being completed
[1:54:27] so the battle is not the pastor behind
[1:54:28] the blessing the battle is dead
[1:54:33] you have to get that in you
[1:54:35] you're fighting for that
[1:54:37] those virtues to live
[1:54:40] oh my god
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:52] believers of the word and spirit must be
[1:54:53] one
[1:54:55] believers the word and spirit are
[1:54:56] absolutely one
[1:54:57] you don't do your own thinking you don't
[1:54:59] use your own mind the mind of christ is
[1:55:02] in you
[1:55:03] and the mind is in christ you take the
[1:55:04] word like he did
[1:55:06] excuse me
[1:55:21] with this thing i get tired quickly so
[1:55:23] yes
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:35] so watch
[1:55:36] here we go let's watch yourself
[1:55:39] so the bible is manifested again like it
[1:55:42] was in the end of christ
[1:55:43] because are you ready
[1:55:45] you are
[1:55:47] a predestinated seed just like christ
[1:55:50] was yes
[1:55:54] that that amen is light
[1:55:57] you have to believe this this is the
[1:55:58] word now he's saying you are
[1:56:02] a predestinated seed
[1:56:04] just like christ was
[1:56:06] and when the rain
[1:56:08] falls on the seed
[1:56:10] the life produces itself
[1:56:13] when the holy spirit falls
[1:56:16] false
[1:56:17] let me say again false
[1:56:20] the holy spirit have to fall
[1:56:22] i don't care what mysteries what
[1:56:24] revelation what teaching what unfolding
[1:56:26] the holy spirit of all
[1:56:28] after the mysteries
[1:56:30] after the teaching
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:36] then he says when it fell on those seeds
[1:56:39] that jesus said he chose them before the
[1:56:42] foundation of the world
[1:56:43] and they were predestinated seed is that
[1:56:45] right
[1:56:46] peter seed was in his soul
[1:56:48] but he couldn't walk out before the
[1:56:49] upper room and say my seed in my soul
[1:56:51] he said tarry in the city of jerusalem
[1:56:54] until you endure with more books
[1:56:58] more mysteries more revelations more
[1:57:00] informations more explanations no tyrion
[1:57:03] television power from one height
[1:57:06] the world is power from where on high
[1:57:08] not just
[1:57:09] from where it coming from online
[1:57:11] that means nothing below
[1:57:13] not from caesar not from pilot
[1:57:15] not from the roman government but from
[1:57:17] high

[1:57:32] father you and me and i and you
[1:57:34] he's prophesying

[1:57:41] my commandments
[1:57:42] and i my father will manifest myself to
[1:57:44] them
[1:57:45] so they're going in your room waiting
[1:57:46] for something something bigger than them
[1:57:49] something more powerful than them
[1:57:50] something unexpected in the upper room
[1:57:52] mary magdalene is there along with mary
[1:57:54] mother of jesus but mary's are there oh

[1:58:43] upper room these seeds the word
[1:58:47] the world was laying there without life
[1:58:49] in it

[1:59:17] title d the abstract title deed they're
[1:59:19] waiting for water to manifest the virtue
[1:59:21] of christ
[1:59:22] they're waiting for the waters to say
[1:59:24] silver gold have i none what a high i
[1:59:26] could give
[1:59:27] without them waters they can't give
[1:59:28] nothing because of waters is the power
[1:59:30] behind it jesus said it is where he that
[1:59:32] believeth on me as the scripture had
[1:59:34] said out of his belly shall float rivers
[1:59:37] of living water this spare key of the

[1:59:54] artesian well
[1:59:55] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:59:57] out of his belly his belly his belly not
[2:00:00] somebody as well his belly
[2:00:02] shall flow flow flow
[2:00:05] flow blessed is the man that walketh not
[2:00:07] on the consequent godly nor stand in the
[2:00:09] way of the sin of sinners
[2:00:11] nor seat of the seat up sit in the sea
[2:00:13] of the scornful but isn't is he light in
[2:00:15] the law of the lord and in that law

[2:00:50] amen all right
[2:00:52] the haulings of the upper room all of a
[2:00:54] sudden they came outside from heaven as
[2:00:56] the waters
[2:00:57] began to gush down it actually fill all
[2:01:00] the house where they were sitting
[2:01:02] and the seeds began to grow
[2:01:04] it began to manifest itself the word of
[2:01:06] god being manifested
[2:01:09] so watch all the power peter and him had
[2:01:11] cast no devils and doing work with jesus
[2:01:13] was temporary
[2:01:15] that is only because they are suicidal
[2:01:17] jesus he gave them a lick of the fire
[2:01:19] upon them
[2:01:20] but it wasn't in them
[2:01:22] they didn't know what spirit they were
[2:01:23] of
[2:01:24] he told them that when they had issues
[2:01:26] trying to call on fire trying to stop
[2:01:28] somebody from preaching he said listen
[2:01:29] all the people are seth now they know
[2:01:31] you know what spiritual earth
[2:01:32] shall be calling for fire like elijah
[2:01:34] they feel they could speak all kind of
[2:01:35] thing no they have no holy ghost area
[2:01:39] they have a temporary blessing for
[2:01:41] ministry to work with jesus
[2:01:44] same as when god gave you the new spirit
[2:01:47] to work with your
[2:01:48] own spirit
[2:01:50] your new spirit is to get along with the
[2:01:52] holy spirit because you're spiritual
[2:01:54] corrupt and the only reason upon you is
[2:01:55] trouble
[2:01:56] so you say i'll give you a new spirit
[2:01:59] to help you walk along with
[2:02:02] the holy spirit see all right all right
[2:02:06] so let's continue here
[2:02:07] don't put it back
[2:02:08] see how the all right let's get down
[2:02:10] here
[2:02:13] i sk i skip this
[2:02:15] you talk about um
[2:02:16] men want i i believe in the leadership i
[2:02:19] believe in the leadership of the holy
[2:02:20] ghost coming to the word
[2:02:22] i believe also that god has set men in
[2:02:24] the church men who are gifted by the
[2:02:25] spirit and they will keep the church in
[2:02:27] order i believe also the church is ruled
[2:02:30] by men that god sends to take charge but
[2:02:33] that rule is by the word so that there's
[2:02:34] not men really ruling by the spirit of
[2:02:37] god for the word and spirit are one see
[2:02:39] remember them which have ruled over you
[2:02:41] who have spoken unto you the word and
[2:02:43] whose fate follow considering the end of
[2:02:46] the conversation but kelly so thank you
[2:02:48] for that letter that you sent
[2:02:50] but see what was happening back there
[2:02:52] that false vine was getting a hole it
[2:02:56] was teaching that rulership by man was
[2:02:58] right it taught that the church had to
[2:03:00] be governed it taught a control over the
[2:03:02] people but instead of doing it god's way
[2:03:04] they simply took authority vested all
[2:03:06] the spiritual power in their own hands
[2:03:07] and came out with a holy priesthood
[2:03:09] standing between god and the people this
[2:03:11] is the issue right here
[2:03:12] there is no fight for ministries to
[2:03:14] establishing god and the people
[2:03:15] that is not wanted for at all you see
[2:03:17] that the holy priesthood standing
[2:03:18] between you and god you had to go to the
[2:03:20] priest to get to god
[2:03:21] that the ironic thing
[2:03:23] see hear what he said you know he said
[2:03:25] they went back look he said right here
[2:03:27] he said
[2:03:28] they vested all the spiritual power in
[2:03:30] their own hands and came out with the
[2:03:32] holy priesthood standing between god and
[2:03:34] the people they went right back to the
[2:03:36] old ironic system they became antichrist
[2:03:38] for the dispose of his ministership
[2:03:40] imposed their own god hated that the
[2:03:43] ephesians hated that and any two
[2:03:45] believers hate that too
[2:03:47] we would have to be stoned blind not to
[2:03:49] see the same thing at work all through
[2:03:51] the ages and right now it is worst of
[2:03:53] all
[2:03:54] what it was was organization that
[2:03:56] separated the people god's people are
[2:03:58] supposed to be one
[2:04:00] by one spirit
[2:04:02] they're all baptized into one body and
[2:04:04] everyone is to be moved upon by the holy
[2:04:06] ghost oh god this song is so good
[2:04:08] everyone is to be moved upon
[2:04:11] by the holy ghost
[2:04:13] isn't that right
[2:04:14] right and he says now watch
[2:04:17] okay
[2:04:19] and everyone is to participate in the
[2:04:21] worship of god but men wanted the
[2:04:24] preeminence
[2:04:25] so they took over control bishop become
[2:04:27] archbishop and with imposing titles they
[2:04:29] passed the word and got and taught their
[2:04:31] own doctrines they got the people to
[2:04:32] obey them until the time came their way
[2:04:35] of worship did not anyway resemble the
[2:04:37] early after pentecost these deeds would
[2:04:39] be given to the apostolic succession
[2:04:41] from apostolic succession it was one
[2:04:43] easy and quick step to teach membership
[2:04:45] as a means of saving grace the word were
[2:04:48] reduced or creed antichrist by his
[2:04:50] spirit was predominate in the church and
[2:04:52] people didn't recognize it lucifer take
[2:04:54] over the church lucy for playing priests
[2:04:56] lucifer playing pastor prophet teacher
[2:04:59] evangelist and works
[2:05:01] my
[2:05:02] here we go home stretch
[2:05:04] you must be born again but i'm saying
[2:05:06] that was the first doctrine of jesus
[2:05:09] you must be born again
[2:05:10] he said you search through the subject
[2:05:12] it's a very deep one
[2:05:14] we find out there are so many different
[2:05:15] meanings that people put to it nearly
[2:05:17] all the churches will say you must be
[2:05:18] born again but each one of their
[2:05:19] different interpretations are what you
[2:05:22] must be one again
[2:05:23] so when you said he didn't say you ought
[2:05:24] to be born again he said you must
[2:05:27] now we english-speaking people
[2:05:28] understand what the word must means it
[2:05:30] is absolutely you got to do it it's must
[2:05:32] not you ought to you'd be better off if
[2:05:34] you did but you must be born again and
[2:05:37] if you can just take that word this
[2:05:38] morning and break it down what it means
[2:05:40] how it is totally impossible it's
[2:05:42] essential and great it's totally
[2:05:43] impossible to enter the kingdom of
[2:05:45] heaven or even see it until you are born
[2:05:47] again there's not one person here want
[2:05:49] to go to torment there's nobody here
[2:05:51] drive hundreds of miles shake people's
[2:05:53] hand and so on like that and there's
[2:05:54] duties of pastors to see that this flock
[2:05:57] is fed and so on like that right i'll

[2:06:09] what you were
[2:06:10] until you were actually born again
[2:06:13] of the spirit of god
[2:06:15] it doesn't change you
[2:06:17] your creed
[2:06:18] so all this confession i believe this i
[2:06:20] believe this i believe this i believe
[2:06:22] that that is engineer
[2:06:24] something that happened to change you
[2:06:28] watch it doesn't change you your creed
[2:06:30] joining church changing your ideas or
[2:06:32] good intentions although as good as it
[2:06:34] might seem is still not right there's
[2:06:36] something got to happen see happen

[2:06:54] something have to happen the word is
[2:06:55] happen

[2:07:03] knew he had to go back to his hong kong
[2:07:04] to hometown he was fighting

[2:07:45] afraid there's something happening
[2:07:47] something happened that isaky had
[2:07:48] changed it's not about eso
[2:07:50] so it's not about your enemy
[2:07:52] you see you think about your enemy and
[2:07:53] this one and that one you think about
[2:07:54] them is about you
[2:07:56] you have to change

[2:08:12] after making excuses it's still you
[2:08:14] it's all about you
[2:08:16] when you change everything i'm wrong
[2:08:17] you're going to change
[2:08:18] oh give the lord a shout

[2:08:28] he must change
[2:08:30] god wants you to change
[2:08:32] all right
[2:08:33] so watch you join in church changing
[2:08:35] your ideas your good intentions
[2:08:37] although as good as it might seem still
[2:08:39] not right
[2:08:40] there's something going to happen
[2:08:41] a new body is an experience something
[2:08:43] that takes place so it is not
[2:08:45] that that brings a new book now
[2:08:46] different churches say well you accept
[2:08:48] this or believe this but that isn't it
[2:08:50] so no matter how much we think we are
[2:08:52] right
[2:08:54] saying or creed and what not you say you
[2:08:57] must be born again
[2:08:58] in order to be born again
[2:09:00] here we go
[2:09:01] jesus said you must be born again all to
[2:09:03] be born again is letting yourself go and
[2:09:05] die
[2:09:06] and the spirit of christ coming to you
[2:09:08] and you're no more yours it's christ in
[2:09:10] you see
[2:09:11] the holy spirit paul said i die daily
[2:09:13] daily
[2:09:14] yet i live not i but christ live it in
[2:09:16] me
[2:09:17] count please
[2:09:19] and if i told you that the spirit of
[2:09:20] john dillinger was in me i've had guns
[2:09:23] here and be outlawed because that was
[2:09:25] his spirit in me if i told you the
[2:09:27] spirit of as an artist you expect me to
[2:09:29] paint the pictures about this if i tell
[2:09:31] them a christian and the spirit of
[2:09:32] christ is in me or in you then we do the
[2:09:35] works of christ and jesus said in saint
[2:09:37] john he that believeth on me the works
[2:09:38] that i do
[2:09:40] shall you do also
[2:09:41] but abound
[2:09:44] if the tree was holy his branch is holy
[2:09:46] the original tree because they
[2:09:47] disbelieved the pentecostal message that
[2:09:49] paul was preaching god cut them off took
[2:09:51] a wild olive tree the witches of the
[2:09:53] gentiles grafted us in that we might
[2:09:55] live off the substance of that tree
[2:09:58] now how much more in this day when we
[2:10:00] are rejecting the pentecostal message
[2:10:03] that come down to the church ages how
[2:10:05] much more is god able to take the old
[2:10:06] wild tree off of it anyhow and let the
[2:10:09] other one come in because he will reject
[2:10:11] it because of unbelief
[2:10:12] now you know where we are standing now
[2:10:15] don't you we are the end time for the
[2:10:17] taken away of the gentile church the
[2:10:18] rapture for it the issuing in of the
[2:10:21] holy ghost to come upon the jews
[2:10:23] and jesus then begins to have known to
[2:10:25] the seal 144 thousand there you are
[2:10:28] bringing back the original tree back
[2:10:30] into the blessed israel again
[2:10:32] jesus ain't going to stand outside of
[2:10:33] your door and knock all the time
[2:10:36] there's a time when he will get enough
[2:10:37] and turn away
[2:10:39] then you will do the knocking you will
[2:10:41] never find him
[2:10:42] come while it is time
[2:10:45] come
[2:10:46] while there's a knock
[2:10:48] don't you compromise with anything less
[2:10:50] than the baptism of the holy ghost like
[2:10:53] they got at pentecost with the same type
[2:10:56] of water baptism the same thing i did
[2:10:58] back there don't you let nothing put
[2:11:00] anything in your heart
[2:11:01] less than that may the lord bless you
[2:11:02] let's all stand
