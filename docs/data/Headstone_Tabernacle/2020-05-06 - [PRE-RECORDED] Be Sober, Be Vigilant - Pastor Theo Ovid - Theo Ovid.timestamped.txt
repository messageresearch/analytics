[26:48] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[26:51] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[26:53] thief in the night and when they shall

[27:33] night but let us wha of the day be sober
[27:37] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[27:40] love and when helmet the hope of

[28:03] that's the title tonight be sober be
[28:07] vigilant supposed to be serious
[28:12] vigilance is keeping careful watch for

[28:31] name of the Lord we believe that Alright
[28:34] looking forward to see what the Lord
[28:37] will do tonight and only amplify that
[28:40] first prescriptive read first Peter 5:8
[28:42] o 9 it says be well-balanced temperate
[28:48] sober in mind be vigilant and porcius at
[28:52] all times for that enemy of yours
[28:56] the devil roams around like a roaring
[28:59] lion in fierce hunger seeking someone to
[29:04] seize upon and devour withstand them be
[29:10] firm in faith against his onset rooted
[29:17] established strong a movable and
[29:21] determined knowing that the same
[29:24] identical sufferings appointed to your
[29:28] Brotherhood the whole body of Christians
[29:30] throughout the world Oh hallelujah
[29:35] hallelujah the prophet a devil is almost
[29:39] harmless unless he had have something to
[29:44] work in you remember those Devils that
[29:47] were cast out of Legion he said they
[29:50] want to do more mischievousness so they
[29:52] wanted to go into the hugs
[29:54] so Devils must have something to work in
[29:58] and somebody to walk through and that's
[30:02] the way God does too he has to have us
[30:05] he is depending on us to work through us
[30:09] Oh glory to God so God is dependent on
[30:13] you he's looking to you really that all
[30:17] glory to God two powers and they are two
[30:19] kingdoms and do you know we have had
[30:21] wars after wars and rumors of wars but
[30:24] if the earth stands we'll have plenty
[30:25] more wars and do you realize that
[30:28] there's only two powers in all the
[30:30] universe of all differences between
[30:32] nations differences between each other
[30:35] and everything it all monks up to two
[30:38] powers there's only two powers there's
[30:41] only two kingdoms two powers two
[30:44] kingdoms and all these magnetons are
[30:46] connected with either one of those
[30:49] powers what you may think is minor is
[30:51] connected to a power or glory they've
[30:54] got this battle they decide on earth
[30:56] this battle isn't shattered in heaven he
[30:59] said the Battle of heaven fell upon
[31:01] earth and the back of angels become the
[31:04] battle of human battles the battle of
[31:06] angel became the battle of men or glory

[1:15:48] he's not to hide in them he did one
[1:15:50] ministry than them he work harder than
[1:15:52] them he's more worried than them and he
[1:15:54] had to grind true because you have to

[1:15:56] victory
[1:15:58] all them fighters fight the victory for
[1:16:00] they were nearing all the doctors that's

[1:16:09] fighter in his mind and in dear but I
[1:16:12] Branham call it the arrow is ready Lion
[1:16:14] of the tribe of Judah prevailed
[1:16:16] was Nani crossing over they're gonna get
[1:16:18] cemani going he finished it it was done
[1:16:20] Oh chlorine is what not if it is
[1:16:22] possible at this path though he finished
[1:16:24] by that no he no way he was going he
[1:16:26] knew what he was doing he'd know that
[1:16:28] Alixe was involved he not his pain but
[1:16:30] he was willing known Oh Chloe kept away
[1:16:33] from his all his fears all the
[1:16:34] hindrances all the upset he got it from
[1:16:36] that listen you wouldn't lose you win ah
[1:16:41] come on I'm not gonna kill you're gonna
[1:16:44] raise again you'll become alive to
[1:16:47] higher order higher level you have to
[1:16:49] see the higher picture and when Jesus
[1:16:51] grinding sure look at that he said can't
[1:16:53] you watch me 1 over 1 hour he said watch
[1:16:57] and pray Oh glory to God ever want to
[1:17:00] bring you some picture but you watching
[1:17:02] you pray oh come on now give the Lord
[1:17:04] some praises Oh hallelujah I won't keep
[1:17:09] you long
[1:17:13] there's only 2 power sittin his power
[1:17:16] he's got is a perverted power of God
[1:17:19] it's a provision of God's power
[1:17:22] everything season has debt is a polluted
[1:17:25] life a lie is a treatment old adultery
[1:17:30] is a righteous act misused everything
[1:17:33] the season has got is something that was
[1:17:35] perverted but it's a power so you can
[1:17:39] say he had no power it's a power but a
[1:17:41] polluted power so sittin dwelled in the
[1:17:44] realm of pavillion whenever you find a
[1:17:48] provision perverted thoughts mind and
[1:17:51] attitude and behavior is satanic
[1:17:53] because that is where he realm like when
[1:17:55] he dwells oh my / Gideon hallelujah and
[1:18:02] this is where my mom said sin did not
[1:18:05] originate in it it originated in heaven
[1:18:08] and it was thrown down from heaven cast
[1:18:11] out to heaven to the earth and fell on
[1:18:13] human pinions then the battle from
[1:18:16] angels became human battles and Satan
[1:18:20] come to destroy God's creation what God
[1:18:22] had created to be for himself
[1:18:24] Satan come to destroy this and that is
[1:18:27] what his purpose was to destroy it then
[1:18:30] the battle began here on earth and begin
[1:18:33] in US and has been region ever since
[1:18:36] this great battle that started on it
[1:18:39] they had to be a mutual meeting place
[1:18:42] they had to be a play selected for the
[1:18:44] battle to begin and for the back of the
[1:18:46] range and the battleground beginner the
[1:18:48] human mind that is where the battle
[1:18:51] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[1:18:55] place of the battle where it was begin
[1:18:57] and that is because decisions are made
[1:19:01] from the mind the head it never start
[1:19:05] from some organization they never
[1:19:07] started in some mechanical affair
[1:19:09] oh my Oh glory to God
[1:19:12] something has to happen on the inside he
[1:19:15] says your mind accepts it the word it
[1:19:17] grasp it what is your mind controlled by
[1:19:19] your spirit and your spirit catches the
[1:19:22] wood of God and that's the thing that
[1:19:24] got life in it it brings life into you
[1:19:26] brother
[1:19:26] what takes place then the life come
[1:19:28] tongues and that channel into you the
[1:19:30] Word of God is manifested in you and
[1:19:32] that's why the Prophet said we're gonna
[1:19:34] play something he says when the
[1:19:36] invisible become visible then God is
[1:19:41] manifested so this battle of angels that
[1:19:45] has become human battles you will begin
[1:19:48] to see this warfare in the physical
[1:19:51] realm so when Jesus cast the devil out
[1:19:56] the people saw a supernatural power
[1:19:59] being defeated by the power of God when
[1:20:03] Jesus opened the blind eye that was
[1:20:06] Jesus uncovering blindness that belonged
[1:20:10] to Satan and bring insight when Jesus
[1:20:13] brought Lazarus from the grave that was
[1:20:16] the power of God conquering debt
[1:20:18] ensuring that life is more powerful than
[1:20:20] debt and even though Satan could snatch
[1:20:23] that young girl and bring it the dead
[1:20:25] Jesus could snatch it back
[1:20:27] or glory of God the man that was
[1:20:31] crippled he could tell the man Street
[1:20:33] now look at those guys who brought their
[1:20:36] friend and open up the roof and drop the
[1:20:38] friend down
[1:20:38] oh my dick couldn't come in him didn't
[1:20:43] leave but the bringing it wasn't another
[1:20:44] ambulance and they bring it they walk
[1:20:46] with him a nut crunch and the crowd was
[1:20:49] all wrong the bus true and they let him
[1:20:52] know but here comes a batter the devil
[1:20:57] have another condition and God is
[1:21:00] standing there and they watching to see
[1:21:02] what he was doing because Sabbath day
[1:21:04] they have pressed on politically they
[1:21:09] have Moses see they have the tradition
[1:21:12] of the elders their custom having
[1:21:14] service a certain way Jesus wasn't
[1:21:16] delivered in tradition actually came the
[1:21:18] brigade he was a man that broke
[1:21:20] tradition is a which is easier
[1:21:24] [Music]
