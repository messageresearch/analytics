[16:33] is
[16:34] lord an economic pandemic it is a it is
[16:37] an ecclesiastical pandemic law there's
[16:39] so much that is
[16:40] changing and taking place and unfolding
[16:43] before our very eyes lord we
[16:45] lord cherish the opportunity to take
[16:48] comfort in your word we
[16:50] lord relish the opportunity to guide
[16:53] lord to
[16:54] be able to step above the carnal things
[16:56] to be able to step
[16:58] higher lower than the situations that
[17:00] could so
[17:01] easily be set us so easily weigh us down
[17:04] and
[17:05] there are so many other things that we
[17:07] might have considered to do tonight or
[17:08] there are so many other obligations
[17:10] that the course of life may be man from
[17:13] us but we are responding to the call
[17:16] lord despite our feelings despite our
[17:18] varied commitments despite the various
[17:21] challenges that we have encountered and
[17:23] we will continue to encounter
[17:25] we come to the spiritual gas station
[17:28] tonight we come to
[17:30] lord the petrol station on the oil
[17:32] station for the
[17:34] lord where we could lord add lord
[17:36] nutrients spiritual nutrients to keep
[17:39] running
[17:39] to keep living so help us tonight as we
[17:41] approach your word
[17:43] lord may you bless every brother every
[17:45] sister lord every father every mother
[17:47] every
[17:48] young person every child lord everyone
[17:51] that is here tonight
[17:52] lord may something be said lord i would
[17:54] minister to someone in a special way
[17:57] lord take me out of the way and speak
[18:00] lip to ear to your children
[18:02] lord you have found a way lord to
[18:04] preserve your thoughts and your thinking
[18:06] lord both your way of thinking and the
[18:09] things that you thought about
[18:11] lord you have found a way to capture
[18:12] that lord through the written word and
[18:14] we thank you lord for sending
[18:16] lord the stars lord throughout each age
[18:19] lord and to us
[18:20] specifically that seventh star lord to
[18:23] bring
[18:24] clarity to tie the loose ends as it were
[18:27] lord to give us the
[18:28] reveal word that we could look at the
[18:30] written word through the eyes of the
[18:31] revealed word so
[18:32] lord may you speak to us tonight if
[18:34] there's anyone lord who is depressed or
[18:36] feeling down or
[18:38] feeling frustrated or dealing with some
[18:40] situation that they feel it's too much
[18:42] to obey or
[18:43] too much to handle lord may you speak to
[18:46] them
[18:46] lord through your word today and they
[18:48] could see lord themselves in your word
[18:51] and they can see
[18:52] lord that there's nothing by chance
[18:55] there is no
[18:55] accident and lord only when we can look
[18:58] back we could see how it all
[19:00] has been making sense all along and
[19:02] there's no lord nothing that is an
[19:03] accident with you so we commit tonight
[19:05] into your hands
[19:06] in the precious name of jesus christ
[19:08] amen
[19:10] and amen and amen so
[19:13] uh it's certainly a great privilege uh
[19:16] to be here tonight
[19:18] one more time and um i was having a bit
[19:20] of a challenge earlier to connect so
[19:23] bear with me tonight um if the
[19:25] connection made me deposit we are
[19:27] trusting god
[19:28] uh that he has a plan for us tonight
[19:31] and um i'll be trying to keep on top of
[19:34] of of if if it goes down someone will
[19:36] let me know
[19:38] but certainly by the grace of god we are
[19:40] here tonight and we thank god for his
[19:41] love for his mercy
[19:43] um are you thankful tonight for god
[19:45] preserving you for keeping you
[19:47] you know to hole in your hands you know
[19:50] when
[19:50] when you need strength he is our comfort
[19:52] he's our refuge
[19:54] and um i am always encouraged by that
[19:57] story of the footprints on the signs of
[19:59] time
[20:00] you know when you know the story goes
[20:02] that
[20:03] at one point he looks back and see but
[20:05] but how is it that when
[20:07] in my deepest toughest moments you know
[20:10] you know he's only one set of footprints
[20:11] one thing was going good it seemed like
[20:12] it was two set of footprints but in
[20:14] rough moments it was just
[20:15] one set of footprints you know is it
[20:17] that i was left alone and
[20:19] and and the story unfolded that he said
[20:20] that said that's when i was carrying you
[20:22] you know when you couldn't
[20:23] carry yourself you know is when i was
[20:25] carrying you you know and and that is
[20:28] i think the testimony for all of us and
[20:30] that we share
[20:31] that he's the one that carries us he's
[20:33] the one that keeps us you know so
[20:35] uh he is keeping us in the in the palm
[20:37] of his hands
[20:38] and he is watching how everything
[20:39] unfolds and we we continue to trust him
[20:42] in every way that that we can so
[20:44] by the grace of god tonight we want to
[20:46] go into the word tonight
[20:48] and um uh by the grace of god
[20:52] i want to actually go to the old
[20:54] testament uh tonight
[20:56] i know we have been in revelation for
[20:58] some time but
[20:59] um i also have to respond to the call
[21:03] and i felt led for some time that i
[21:05] wanted to kind of touch on this and um
[21:07] i'll see how far i can get into this
[21:08] tonight but i believe that it is
[21:10] something to encourage us and
[21:12] something that we all sought to know and
[21:14] understand
[21:15] um it is a it is a study that i believe
[21:18] all of us would would have encountered
[21:20] in some way
[21:21] some form but by the grace of god we
[21:23] want to
[21:24] kind of put pull some elements out of it
[21:27] tonight
[21:28] um it is quite a large study
[21:31] uh so i know that it will it will not be
[21:33] able to be completed in in one session
[21:36] so we will see how far we can get and
[21:39] maybe
[21:39] you know i could i could kind of you
[21:41] know try to cover as much of it as
[21:43] possible tonight
[21:44] so tonight i want to go to the book of
[21:47] genesis
[21:48] and you know it's appropriate because we
[21:51] for this year thus far we have been in
[21:54] the book of revelation
[21:55] and we know that uh you know brother
[21:58] ranum taught us
[21:59] that if it's two books that the devil
[22:02] doesn't like
[22:03] it is genesis and revelation
[22:06] um so we want to be in
[22:09] in genesis uh tonight
[22:13] and uh we want to be looking at
[22:16] the study of we are actually going to
[22:19] have a study tonight on the study of
[22:21] joseph
[22:22] uh tonight uh are you hearing me am i am
[22:25] i
[22:26] coming through
[22:36] you're fine you're fine
[22:40] so we want to be in genesis we're going
[22:42] to sat in genesis 37 tonight
[22:45] um and it is really something else
[22:49] because
[22:51] joseph as we know uh is that is a type
[22:54] of christ
[22:55] hated without a cause and there are so
[22:57] many parallels
[22:58] and we understand you know when we look
[23:01] at the patriarchs
[23:03] you know abraham isaac jacob
[23:07] joseph abraham feet isaac love
[23:10] jacob grace joseph perfection we see all
[23:13] this through the word and we understand
[23:15] these things but
[23:16] as i would have said you know last year
[23:18] sometimes we
[23:19] we look at at these stories and we pull
[23:21] out some pieces and
[23:22] we never really slow down to process it
[23:25] you know so
[23:26] i want to kind of slow down the car and
[23:27] kind of take it you know
[23:29] step by step as a real foundation
[23:32] because
[23:33] we have to understand these these
[23:34] foundational teachings you know so
[23:36] we're gonna start from genesis 37 who's
[23:39] one to get right into it tonight
[23:41] uh genesis 37 and verse one
[23:44] and we we know jacob we would have done
[23:47] a teaching on jacob last year uh
[23:50] you know jacob have to wrestle with the
[23:52] angel and and we can't go into all of
[23:54] that tonight and maybe by the grace of
[23:55] god we could speak on that some of the
[23:57] time but
[23:58] we're starting here now with jacob
[24:00] genesis 37 and verse one and jacob dwelt
[24:02] in the land
[24:03] wherein his father which would have been
[24:04] isaac was a stranger
[24:06] in the land of canaan these are the
[24:10] generations of jacob verse 2 joseph
[24:14] being 17 years old
[24:16] a teenager 17 years old was feeding the
[24:19] flock
[24:19] with his brethren uh in the amplified it
[24:22] would it would make it clear that it
[24:23] would have been
[24:24] dan naphtali god and asha
[24:28] uh and the lad was with the sons of
[24:30] bilhah and with the sons of zilpha
[24:32] his father's wives and joseph brought
[24:35] unto his father the evil report in other
[24:37] words
[24:38] at age 17 joseph was
[24:42] coming home to daddy and telling daddy
[24:44] hear what dan naftali gar and asha doing
[24:47] and brought back a bad report uh
[24:50] to their father about you know their
[24:54] behaviors their actions their activities
[24:56] and so forth
[24:57] you know so you know joseph
[25:01] as you look through scripture was a was
[25:03] a unique unique unique son
[25:06] a a a unique example and and verse 3
[25:09] goes on
[25:10] now israel loved joseph more than all
[25:13] his children
[25:14] because he was the son of his old age
[25:17] and he made him a coat of many colors
[25:22] and uh we would have touched on this
[25:26] in many ways before and going into verse
[25:29] four
[25:30] i kind of want to speak through some of
[25:31] these to kind of get to some deeper
[25:32] context and
[25:33] was found when his brethren saw that
[25:36] their father loved him
[25:37] more than all his brethren they hated
[25:39] him and
[25:40] could not speak peaceably unto him
[25:45] in the amplified it says his brothers
[25:46] saw that their father loved joseph
[25:48] more than all of his brothers so they
[25:50] hated him and could not find it
[25:53] within themselves to speak to him
[25:56] on friendly tombs i want to pause there
[25:58] just a little bit
[25:59] to take note of the fact that jacob's
[26:02] love
[26:02] for joseph was
[26:06] jacob's love for joseph joseph
[26:10] could not turn up or turn down that love
[26:12] in that sense
[26:14] so the feelings that his brothers had
[26:16] towards him
[26:18] was really a misplaced one because if
[26:21] it was that jacob's love was due to
[26:23] joseph
[26:24] if the brothers had issue the issue
[26:26] should have been with jacob and not
[26:28] joseph
[26:29] because joseph was not the one who was
[26:31] activating
[26:32] that love so i just want to kind of
[26:34] begin to pull some pieces here together
[26:36] so
[26:36] so if if jacob loved joseph
[26:40] why have x with joseph why not vex with
[26:43] jacob
[26:44] so these brothers couldn't as we said in
[26:46] the amber fight couldn't find it within
[26:48] themselves to even speak to him
[26:50] on friendly tombs so already we see a
[26:53] situation where
[26:54] the brothers were beginning to look at
[26:56] joseph a certain way
[26:58] so all of this bear in mind many times
[27:00] we talk about joseph being the dreamer
[27:02] and all these things and when they saw
[27:05] the dream
[27:06] it had an infection we'll get to that
[27:07] but we're seeing that there are two
[27:09] things that are already taking place
[27:11] that already sort of changed the lens or
[27:13] the glasses
[27:14] of the brothers to joseph they already
[27:17] felt a certain kind of way
[27:19] because joseph was you want to go back
[27:22] to the father maybe none of the other
[27:23] brothers were doing
[27:24] anything about what was ever taking
[27:26] place but joseph was the one to go back
[27:28] to the father and say listen
[27:30] my brother is doing things they should
[27:31] not be doing
[27:33] so already they had a certain feeling
[27:35] towards joseph going back to tell jacob
[27:37] what is happening
[27:39] and then they are witnesses of this love
[27:42] that
[27:42] jacob has for joseph and
[27:45] that already has them feeling a certain
[27:48] way towards joseph
[27:49] you know and let's go now to verse five
[27:52] and joseph dreamed a dream
[27:55] and he told it to his brethren and they
[27:57] hated him yet the more
[27:59] so hated him yet the more shows that
[28:02] that
[28:03] and and would type this as his spiritual
[28:05] side now so the
[28:06] what the dream actually represented was
[28:08] an increased level of hate
[28:10] hated him anymore so in other words the
[28:13] heat was already there
[28:16] and the spiritual side of joseph was
[28:18] only amplified
[28:20] when he had the dreams i want to make
[28:21] the point that it wasn't a dream that
[28:23] brought the heat
[28:24] it wasn't even the spiritual aspect of
[28:27] his life that brought the heat
[28:30] all that the spiritual gene the
[28:32] expression of the spiritual
[28:33] gene in him only in only increased the
[28:36] level of hate
[28:37] so so i hope you're catching this
[28:39] tonight a bit
[28:40] so so the hate that was placed on joseph
[28:45] especially the part and i wanted to kind
[28:47] of sit in this part
[28:48] where jacob's love for joseph caused
[28:52] hate
[28:54] jacob had nothing to do
[28:58] rather had nothing to do with that he
[29:00] couldn't do anything about it because
[29:02] the love was coming external to him it
[29:05] was his father's love for him
[29:07] that was causing hate an external
[29:09] situation
[29:10] so i want us to look at it and i always
[29:12] say in the word we have to see it
[29:13] how it impacts us what god takes us
[29:16] through and i have to realize like i
[29:17] heard somebody say
[29:18] we sing this song i love him because he
[29:20] first loved me and
[29:21] and i heard somebody saying it's really
[29:24] difficult
[29:25] for us to really love god in in in
[29:28] in the sense of when you compare god's
[29:31] love for us
[29:32] it's really no comparison our love for
[29:34] him it's a really deep thought
[29:37] because for god already love us
[29:40] for him to know all about us for him to
[29:43] know our
[29:44] beginning our mistakes our ups and downs
[29:47] and still love us
[29:49] it is not something that we in in this
[29:51] way could really be
[29:52] truly honest we can't really have an
[29:54] understanding of it
[29:56] because when situations happen to us or
[29:58] with people who we interact with
[30:00] we feel a certain kind of way about
[30:02] things but that's not how god operates
[30:05] so you can't blame joseph
[30:08] for the way his father felt about him
[30:11] and nobody could blame you
[30:13] for how god feels about you nobody
[30:15] convex with god
[30:17] for how god feels about you and if
[30:19] anybody vex with you
[30:21] because your father love you a certain
[30:23] kind of way
[30:25] it really is not your problem or my
[30:27] problem all right so we're building now
[30:29] so verse five and jacob dreamed the
[30:31] dream
[30:32] and he told it to his brethren and he
[30:33] hated him even more
[30:36] and he said unto them here i pray you
[30:38] this dream which i have dreamed
[30:41] for behold we were binding sheaves in
[30:43] the field
[30:44] and lo my sheath arose and also stood
[30:47] upright and behold
[30:49] your sheaves stood round about and made
[30:51] obesions to my sheath in other words bow
[30:54] down
[30:54] give respect to my sheath and his
[30:57] brethren said to him
[30:58] shall thou indeed reign over us or shall
[31:01] thou indeed have dominion over us
[31:04] and they hated him yet no more
[31:08] for his dreams and for his words
[31:11] so again we see in verse 5
[31:15] that he dreamed a dream and they hated
[31:17] him yet the more
[31:18] and by verse 8 they hated him yet the
[31:21] more for his dreams and now they're
[31:22] adding to his words
[31:24] so if hate had a volume and if you could
[31:27] ever find
[31:28] in scripture where hate is being
[31:30] amplified it is in this
[31:32] scripture here in genesis 37.
[31:35] all right now bear in mind he's not
[31:37] being malicious
[31:39] he is not intensely trying to hurt
[31:40] anybody he didn't ask for the dream
[31:43] he didn't say lord tell me my future he
[31:46] said i dream a dream he excited to
[31:48] express the dream
[31:49] there's nothing here to clear up if he
[31:51] even had a full understanding of what he
[31:53] dreamed
[31:54] meant but clearly people could begin to
[31:56] try to put the pieces together about it
[31:58] and here it is he is being hated as we
[32:01] know without a cause
[32:02] because he didn't do what he did all
[32:04] right
[32:06] first nine and he dreamed yet another
[32:09] dream
[32:12] and told it to his brethren and said
[32:13] behold i have dreamed the dream
[32:16] more and behold the sun and the moon and
[32:19] the eleven stars
[32:21] made obesions to me and he told it to
[32:24] his father
[32:25] and to his brethren and his father
[32:27] rebuked him now i want us to take this
[32:29] in context as well
[32:31] joseph is young he is 17
[32:34] years old and there's something to be
[32:38] said about a 17 year old
[32:40] who is being exposed to certain things
[32:45] you know we look at jesus and the bible
[32:47] said that jesus
[32:48] learned obedience by the things that he
[32:51] suffered
[32:52] in the details of all of the suffering
[32:54] but it was a process
[32:56] that was shaping molding jesus
[33:00] into the character that god wanted to
[33:02] use him for
[33:04] so we see joseph at 17 may not have
[33:07] fully understood the impact of his
[33:10] testimony
[33:11] on those around him so he is excited he
[33:14] is
[33:15] joyous that he is seeing something that
[33:17] nobody else may have experienced
[33:20] and he told it to his father until his
[33:21] bridging and his father rebuked
[33:24] him and said unto him what is this dream
[33:28] that thou has dreamed shall i
[33:31] and thy mother and thy brethren indeed
[33:35] come to bow down ourselves to dee to the
[33:37] earth
[33:39] verse 11 changes now
[33:44] verse 11 doesn't speak about hate
[33:48] it's sweet snow from here to envy
[33:53] so it is a it's an amplification taking
[33:56] place
[33:56] and you realize that at times when
[33:59] people
[34:00] hate you the hatred is because they
[34:03] really want what you have they hate you
[34:07] for having what they want to have
[34:10] so this hatred was now turning into
[34:12] something even deeper
[34:14] and his brethren envied him the bible
[34:16] says
[34:18] and his father observed the saying so
[34:21] observe the saying
[34:22] here in verse 11 meant
[34:26] his father was wondering about their
[34:28] beating
[34:29] so the brothers getting envious but
[34:31] jacob in his mind
[34:32] he said what is mean boy what is mean
[34:34] boy so i'm laying a foundation
[34:36] we're trying to go somewhere and his
[34:39] father observation and his brethren went
[34:41] to feed their father's flock in shechem
[34:44] and israel said to joseph do not die
[34:47] bridge and feel the
[34:49] shashim come and i will send thee unto
[34:51] them
[34:52] and he said to him here am i so joseph
[34:54] presented himself
[34:56] clearly it was a case that jacob used to
[34:58] keep joseph close by
[34:59] and you know under his watch and he
[35:02] wasn't really going out there with the
[35:03] flock and that kind of stuff
[35:05] and he said to him go i pray thee see
[35:07] whether it'd be well
[35:08] with ibrahim it kind of sounds like
[35:11] david story to it
[35:12] go and see everything well with your
[35:14] brothers and well with the flocks
[35:16] and bring me word again so he sent him
[35:20] out of the veil of hebron
[35:22] and he came to sheshem and a certain man
[35:26] found him and behold he was wandering in
[35:28] the field
[35:29] and a man asked him saying what seekers
[35:31] though and he said i seek my brethren
[35:34] tell me i pray where they feed their
[35:36] flock so
[35:37] joseph they are looking he's trying to
[35:39] find his brothers he he
[35:40] is he's not he's obviously not an expert
[35:43] at the terrain
[35:44] he's lost you see is out of his element
[35:46] i want to
[35:47] paint a picture here of the evolution of
[35:50] this character named joseph
[35:52] he's out there he's wandering and you
[35:54] feel
[35:55] he is lost he said tell me i prayed yes
[35:58] i look if you're
[35:59] looking for my brothers
[36:02] and the man said they are departed hence
[36:05] for i heard them say
[36:06] let us go to dothan and joseph went
[36:08] after his brethren
[36:10] and found them in dothan
[36:13] and when they saw him afar off even
[36:16] before
[36:17] he came near unto them they conspired
[36:20] against him
[36:21] to slay him so
[36:25] what was once joseph go on and tell
[36:27] daddy about me you know
[36:30] joseph galcott of many colors none of we
[36:33] ever get that quote
[36:36] joseph had a dream i like that boy
[36:38] joseph joseph have our next dream
[36:40] but i hate joseph as he was getting
[36:42] dreams
[36:43] and and he feel you better than us
[36:46] joseph have a next dream
[36:47] even if i don't know wondering what's
[36:48] going on and hate building now to envy
[36:51] how is it he can dream and again dream
[36:54] to the point that joseph now
[36:55] approaching you and you say you know
[36:56] what let us kill him
[37:01] and that's a that's a really interesting
[37:04] journey to see human behavior
[37:06] and this is not cousin this is not
[37:09] friend
[37:10] this is not neighbor this is not this is
[37:13] brother we're talking about albeit half
[37:15] brothers these are people who grew up in
[37:17] the roof
[37:18] grew up in the same environment so they
[37:20] conspired against him to slay him
[37:22] and they said to one another behold this
[37:25] dreamer commit
[37:28] come now therefore and let us slay him
[37:30] and cast him
[37:32] into some pit and we will see
[37:35] some evil beast had devoured him and we
[37:38] shall see what will become of his dreams
[37:42] so see how they connected his dying to
[37:45] the dreams
[37:47] now joseph didn't give himself the dream
[37:51] they were perplexed and bothered by the
[37:53] fact that joseph was dreaming of being
[37:55] in power
[37:57] and that they had to subject themselves
[37:59] to his authority and his power
[38:01] so they told themselves if we kill
[38:03] joseph
[38:04] his dream will also die i want us to
[38:07] catch that
[38:08] if joseph dies his dreams will also die
[38:12] with him
[38:14] and they themselves connected it so they
[38:16] say
[38:17] let us kill him and we shall see what
[38:19] will become of his dreams
[38:22] and reuben heard it
[38:25] and he delivered him out of their hands
[38:28] and said let us not kill him
[38:30] in other words ruined in here i
[38:33] air like joseph as much as well yeah but
[38:36] let us not kill him
[38:40] and ruben 17m shed no blood but cast him
[38:43] into this spit that is in the wilderness
[38:45] and lay no hand upon him that he might
[38:48] get
[38:49] rid him out of their hands to deliver
[38:51] him to his father again
[38:52] so roman starting to get cold feet
[38:56] reuben's saying let's put him in this
[38:58] put him in this ditch
[39:00] and ruben telling himself when they
[39:02] threw him here when nobody watching i
[39:04] will take jose back out
[39:06] and carry him back to daddy because i
[39:08] really don't want any part to this
[39:09] so i'm building to something i know a
[39:11] lot of us may know this
[39:12] and some of us may not have spent time
[39:14] reading it in this way
[39:17] and it came to pass now joseph is
[39:20] all is happening where joseph walking
[39:22] innocently i can imagine joseph
[39:24] 17 years old he is whistling he is naive
[39:28] to help his brothers feel about him i
[39:30] want us to process this for a minute
[39:32] because if you ascertain a threat
[39:36] you accidentally people don't like your
[39:38] head you would want even more among them
[39:42] i am sure that they are people that you
[39:44] don't like to go around because you
[39:45] don't feel comfortable with them
[39:47] you know they're not for you you know
[39:49] they don't have your back
[39:51] you know they're not interested in your
[39:52] well-being you know they're not
[39:53] supportive of your dreams
[39:55] you know that if you are successful they
[39:56] will have a problem with it
[39:58] but joseph is still young he is still
[40:01] learning
[40:03] he is still growing he is still coming
[40:05] to a
[40:06] deeper understanding of how things work
[40:09] so he is innocently walking towards his
[40:12] brothers
[40:14] believing that his brothers are totally
[40:16] receptive to him
[40:19] and it came to pass when joseph was come
[40:21] unto his brethren
[40:23] that they stripped joseph out of his
[40:24] coat his coat of many colors that was on
[40:27] him
[40:29] and they took him and cast him into a
[40:30] pit and the pit was empty there was no
[40:33] water in it
[40:37] next verse now this is where it gets
[40:39] somewhat troubling
[40:40] and they sat down to eat bread so
[40:44] imagine you throw your brother in a pit
[40:48] and you so don't have a sense of feeling
[40:50] for his welfare that
[40:52] that you could throw a mini pit and you
[40:54] can sit down and say well
[40:55] you're only ready to eat
[41:00] so they comfortable now and it shows
[41:02] really the condition of their heart
[41:05] and how they allowed this brother
[41:08] young brother joseph to have such an
[41:10] effect on their lives so they sat down
[41:12] to eat bread and they lifted up their
[41:14] eyes and looked
[41:15] and behold a company of ishmaelites came
[41:18] from gilead
[41:20] with their camels bearing spicery and
[41:22] bomb
[41:23] and mu going to carry it down to egypt
[41:27] now i want us to take note of this here
[41:29] verse 26
[41:31] and judah said unto his brethren
[41:35] what prophet is it if we slay our
[41:38] brother
[41:38] and conceal his blood come
[41:42] and let us sell him to the ishmaelites
[41:45] and let not our hand be upon him for he
[41:47] is our brother and our flesh
[41:49] and his brethren were content
[41:57] so the idea of
[42:00] joseph going to egypt came from judah
[42:06] and as you learn scripture and you read
[42:08] scripture and you process certain things
[42:12] i would have preached it before god
[42:13] operates on different levels so he is
[42:16] seeing a bigger picture
[42:18] and here it is you have judah you have
[42:21] reuben who's saying i want to sneak him
[42:24] out and carry him back
[42:25] and you have judah who is saying
[42:28] you know what lord don't let us leave
[42:31] you with the pit let us sell him down to
[42:32] egypt
[42:35] this is the same judah who
[42:39] years to come would have quality the
[42:42] line of
[42:43] judah for which will be the lion of the
[42:45] tribe of judah
[42:47] david will come from him even jesus will
[42:49] come from him
[42:50] and when you look at how this unfolds in
[42:52] genesis
[42:54] you have to see how god is also dealing
[42:56] not just with joseph
[42:58] here but also dealing with judah all
[43:00] right
[43:01] and and we'll see how god does it right
[43:04] so judah idea is to send him to egypt
[43:07] ruben doesn't know this is taking place
[43:09] because
[43:09] ruben gone around to meditate whatever
[43:12] ruben went to do
[43:14] so come let us what prophet is it this
[43:18] is verse
[43:18] 25 26 if we slay our brother and conceal
[43:22] his blood
[43:22] verse 27 come and let us sell him to the
[43:24] ishmaelites
[43:26] which is like their cousins and left not
[43:29] our hand
[43:30] be upon him for he's our brother and our
[43:32] flesh
[43:33] and his brother were content and they
[43:35] passed by media knight mutual men
[43:38] and they drew and lifted up joseph out
[43:40] of the pit
[43:41] and sold joseph to the israelites with
[43:44] 20 pieces of silver
[43:45] and they brought joseph into egypt
[43:49] 17 years old he ain't nobody raised any
[43:52] flock
[43:54] he doesn't know anything about much
[43:55] because he's young in his family
[43:57] his older brothers used to take care of
[43:59] things and joseph at age 17
[44:02] finds himself a slave in egypt and
[44:05] ruben returned unto the pit and behold
[44:08] joseph was not in the pit
[44:10] and he rent his clothes he tore his
[44:11] clothes and he returned onto his
[44:13] president said
[44:14] the child is not and i where shall i go
[44:16] in other words
[44:17] i don't know what to do i don't know
[44:18] where i can go and they took joseph's
[44:21] coat
[44:22] and killed a kid of the goats and dipped
[44:24] the coat in blood
[44:26] and they sent the coat of many colors
[44:29] and they
[44:29] brought it to their father and said this
[44:31] we have found
[44:33] know now whether it be your son's quote
[44:36] or no so them fellas actually bring the
[44:38] quota jacob
[44:39] and say listen jacob i don't know if you
[44:40] recognize this you know we find this
[44:42] quote you tell us
[44:43] is this the one you give to this or not
[44:46] their comments say we found joseph quote
[44:47] to them they say we found a coat
[44:50] with blood you tell us if this is the
[44:52] one that you're made for joseph
[44:55] and the bible said he knew it and said
[44:56] it is my son's quote an
[44:58] evil beast had devoured him joseph is
[45:00] without doubt rent in pieces
[45:03] and jacob rent his clothes and put
[45:05] sackcloth upon his loins
[45:08] and mourned for his son many days
[45:11] and all his sons and all his daughters
[45:14] rose up to comfort him
[45:16] but he refused to be comforted and he
[45:19] said for i will go
[45:20] down into the grave unto my son
[45:23] mourning thus his father wept for him
[45:27] and the media the media knights an
[45:30] officer of pharaoh and captain of the
[45:33] god
[45:34] so this is actually captain of the royal
[45:37] god
[45:38] so potiphar is a powerful man in egypt
[45:41] so this is genesis we just read from
[45:44] genesis 37
[45:46] and for students of scripture
[45:50] i know my internet given a little
[45:51] problem as you let me know
[45:54] so we just read genesis 37
[45:59] and for students of script 38
[46:04] but genesis 38 has no mention
[46:07] of joseph and if you go to genesis 39
[46:10] it picks up joseph and 39
[46:14] 40 41 going on continues
[46:17] joseph and we have this call it pattern
[46:20] interruption in scripture
[46:22] of genesis 38 and theologians
[46:26] always perplexed with how come
[46:29] we have the story of joseph starts in 37
[46:33] and then 38 is all about judah
[46:36] and then 39 picks up joseph again
[46:40] so if you will recall when i would have
[46:42] preached on
[46:43] the generation of jesus christ out of
[46:46] matthew
[46:48] you will see that the first woman
[46:50] mentioned
[46:52] out of the book of matthew was tamara
[46:56] who was judah's daughter-in-law
[46:59] so in genesis 38 we have judah
[47:03] this is a period of time between
[47:08] joseph he'll get in
[47:11] egypt and picking up the story of what's
[47:14] happening with joseph in egypt
[47:16] and it unfolds the story of judah right
[47:18] there in the middle there
[47:20] and it is really a contrast i'm not
[47:23] going to go into it fully now
[47:25] but it's a contrast of the life of judah
[47:27] and the life of joseph
[47:29] here it is you have a case where judah
[47:33] is almost deceived as it were into
[47:38] having a relation with his
[47:40] daughter-in-law he has
[47:44] called it sexual indiscretion in genesis
[47:47] 38.
[47:49] it is a absolute contrast
[47:53] to the failure slash evolution of judah
[47:57] because it was judah who was sending
[48:00] joseph
[48:00] down to egypt but the judah who sent
[48:04] joseph to egypt and the judah that
[48:07] unfolds here in genesis 38
[48:09] it is as if god is saying for the line
[48:12] of judah
[48:13] to carry the royal seed judah has to go
[48:16] through a transformation
[48:19] so when you look at genesis 37 38
[48:22] 39 and going on it is really a series of
[48:25] changes that are taking place
[48:27] changes in the life of joseph changes in
[48:30] life of jacob
[48:31] even a radical change in the life of
[48:33] judah which will unfold later on in the
[48:36] story of joseph
[48:38] because for judah deeper to send his
[48:42] brother into slavery
[48:44] it takes a certain kind of heart to send
[48:46] anybody in in the slavery
[48:49] and when you read it later in the story
[48:51] of joseph if we get to that point
[48:53] tonight
[48:54] you will see the brothers talking about
[48:56] the anguish so
[48:58] joseph didn't walk to the media knights
[49:01] and the ishmaelites
[49:02] the bible said there was anguish in his
[49:04] soul so he wasn't crying
[49:07] he was begging them don't send me
[49:10] i wanted to catch this he was begging
[49:13] them don't send me
[49:14] and the the chief among the brothers who
[49:17] were saying
[49:18] send joseph to egypt was actually judah
[49:22] so genesis 38 we'd have time to go into
[49:25] it in detail now
[49:26] sees this judah who is chief to send
[49:30] joseph now we understand on different
[49:31] levels
[49:32] how god is working and it's his plan of
[49:34] redemption that he's working out
[49:36] but it is as if while god is dealing
[49:39] with joseph and doing what he has to do
[49:41] for joseph
[49:42] because joseph was not going to be the
[49:44] line
[49:45] that would bring christ however if
[49:48] joseph was not in egypt the line that
[49:51] would bring christ would be dead
[49:54] when you unfold the story of joseph if
[49:57] those children of jacob didn't find food
[50:00] they would have died
[50:02] because the famine was killing people
[50:04] without food so god has the
[50:06] wonderful ability to work on multiple
[50:09] people at the same time
[50:12] only god could operate this way so
[50:15] simultaneously
[50:17] he's dealing with a young joseph who has
[50:19] to come into maturity
[50:20] come on now he is dealing with putting
[50:23] things in place
[50:24] to preserve his bloodline if i could say
[50:26] that in other words
[50:29] this whole plan that's unfolding with
[50:31] joseph and egypt and children of israel
[50:33] is to preserve the genes that have to be
[50:36] called the lion of the tribe of judah
[50:38] but judah also has to go through his own
[50:41] transformation
[50:43] to be worthy to be called that line of
[50:47] the tribe of judah
[50:48] if judah didn't go to his transformation
[50:50] then this
[50:51] this judah would have had a testimony of
[50:53] the one who
[50:54] who didn't care about his brother enough
[50:56] to send him to egypt i want us to
[50:58] see how it all starts to come connect
[50:59] together
[51:01] so god in genesis 38 is dealing with
[51:04] judah and we preach about this
[51:06] how judah had sons and his son he says
[51:09] he says his son got married to a young
[51:11] girl and he was so wicked
[51:13] that god killed him and as
[51:17] was the custom when you're a widow
[51:21] and you have no descendants no cages
[51:24] descendants
[51:25] catch this you have to marry again so
[51:28] this daughter in law of judah has to
[51:32] marry the nexon he was so horrible
[51:36] god have to kill him too
[51:39] now bear in mind dealing with the line
[51:42] of judah
[51:43] i hope i hope you're following me here
[51:45] because jesus is the lion or the tribe
[51:47] of judah
[51:48] so judah's seed is important to god
[51:52] anybody with me i want to connect this
[51:54] here so the preservation of judah's seed
[51:57] is important to god
[51:59] and this is why it has a drop in here
[52:01] right before
[52:02] joseph unfolds because if judah's seed
[52:05] doesn't come forth
[52:07] then there is no tribe of judah and the
[52:09] royal line of judah and the lion of the
[52:12] tribe of judah
[52:14] so judah's son would have been the
[52:17] continuation of his seed
[52:18] anybody with me but tima had no
[52:22] son from the first son of judah god
[52:25] killed him
[52:26] the second son god killed him when it
[52:29] was time for the third son
[52:31] judah say when he grow up i will send
[52:34] him for you
[52:37] the bible say that boy grew up went to
[52:39] university went to college
[52:41] become a shopping man and and when it
[52:44] was time
[52:44] to inform tiamat that he is ready for
[52:46] marriage julia sent a text message yes
[52:49] now what's up here i sent a letter
[52:50] he telling yourself i don't lost two
[52:52] boys
[52:54] by this girl i'm not losing my last boy
[52:58] you remember the story we we preach on
[53:00] this and his story unfolds
[53:03] that judah is going to check a friend
[53:05] and different thinker thing and and he
[53:06] meets this
[53:07] woman who heard judah was coming and he
[53:09] didn't know it was and then she was this
[53:11] just as a prostitute and and and and
[53:14] judah had no
[53:15] money with him so he gives certain
[53:17] elements of his
[53:18] as a don payment and and the story
[53:20] unfolds and it's almost like is this
[53:22] even in the bible
[53:24] and we preach that it was in this
[53:26] situation god is unfolding something
[53:29] and when word comes back to judah that
[53:32] tema is pregnant
[53:35] he's like let us go and burn her because
[53:38] once and for all he can put an end
[53:39] to this girl who killed his two sons and
[53:42] when he gets down there
[53:44] to pass judgment on her she said is it
[53:47] okay if i
[53:47] show the the stuff that belonged to the
[53:51] man who was responsible for my child or
[53:53] children because
[53:55] and when she brought it out in wreck he
[53:57] recognized julia kennedy's own stuff
[54:01] and judah made a statement she is more
[54:04] righteous than i
[54:06] in her action in her activity in her
[54:10] humiliating judah
[54:13] she inadvertently i wanted to catch this
[54:16] without even
[54:17] understanding what was going on was
[54:21] actually preserving the line of judah
[54:25] and in so doing also brought humility
[54:29] to judah it forever changed
[54:32] judah so genesis 38
[54:35] is a change taking place in judah's life
[54:38] that will also unfold later on in
[54:39] genesis
[54:40] that was a part of this so so in other
[54:42] words the judah
[54:44] that was quick to say send joseph to
[54:47] egypt
[54:48] was not the same judah at the end of
[54:50] genesis 38.
[54:51] that's the point i want to make that
[54:53] during genesis 38
[54:55] the character named judah who would have
[54:58] sent joseph to egypt
[54:59] this was a different man he had lost two
[55:03] sons
[55:05] he almost lost his food he was publicly
[55:08] embarrassed
[55:09] he got caught in public because here he
[55:11] is as a judge to pass judgment
[55:13] on a woman who was his daughter-in-law
[55:17] and then it is a public exposure that
[55:20] he actually impregnated his
[55:21] daughter-in-law
[55:23] what a thing to be made known to the
[55:26] public so the judah is a judah there's a
[55:28] transformation
[55:29] in there anybody with me so it is an
[55:33] interruption or a pattern interruption
[55:35] in the unfolding of the story
[55:37] but it runs in parallel anybody with me
[55:40] so now we can go to 39.
[55:44] and it picks up 39 as if 38
[55:47] was just it's almost like god in
[55:49] unfolding this whole story is like a
[55:50] scene shift
[55:52] the last scene is joseph being carried
[55:54] to egypt then it switches scenes to
[55:57] judah's
[55:57] in discussion his story and and how a
[56:00] man
[56:00] who was in a position of strength is
[56:02] broken
[56:05] and then we are back to joseph now in
[56:07] egypt
[56:09] and joseph was brought down to egypt
[56:14] now when you read the torah the jews the
[56:16] jewish reading of this
[56:19] would this brought down that we would
[56:21] say down
[56:22] in in english down is not just
[56:25] down as in we go in downtown it was
[56:29] call it a lowering of station so the
[56:31] jews would say
[56:32] it is it is it is it is a falling
[56:34] station so
[56:35] so joseph is being brought down not just
[56:38] physically down
[56:39] but down to egypt down to it it's almost
[56:42] like he's going down with our problem
[56:43] then right
[56:44] so joseph was brought down to egypt and
[56:47] potiphar
[56:48] an officer of pharaoh captain of the god
[56:52] an egyptian bought him of the hands of
[56:55] the ishmaelites which had brought him
[56:56] down further and i love this
[56:59] because this is joseph is in egypt he
[57:02] don't only language
[57:03] he don't know the customs he don't know
[57:06] the traditions
[57:07] so when people say well i don't know
[57:08] adobe experience
[57:10] i never do it before and all i say here
[57:12] is joseph
[57:13] he is a young man barely an adult in our
[57:17] terms
[57:17] and he's brought down and it had to be
[57:21] something about him that caught the eye
[57:23] of potiphar
[57:24] because in those days the slaves would
[57:26] be presented
[57:27] and brought and you would select and
[57:29] pick and something about him caught the
[57:32] eye of the captain of the royal guard
[57:35] now at this time egypt is the most
[57:37] powerful civilization on the youth
[57:39] the captain of the royal god will be a
[57:41] discerning man
[57:42] who is looking for quality he is looking
[57:45] for potential and he spies out joseph
[57:48] and verse two and the lord was with
[57:50] joseph
[57:51] and listen to this he was a prosperous
[57:55] man
[57:56] now in the amplified the appleby said
[57:59] the lord was with joseph and he
[58:02] even though a slave became a successful
[58:05] and prosperous man
[58:07] talk about changing the narrative of
[58:09] your story
[58:11] talk about the odds being against you
[58:13] and you finding a way to press through
[58:15] the situation
[58:17] there's nothing about joseph that speaks
[58:20] to accepting the situation as it is
[58:22] and because my brothers do it yeah
[58:25] people who live in that self-pity and
[58:26] pity party
[58:28] i don't know why i do i know i didn't do
[58:29] nothing and look where i am
[58:31] now and i go just along here and then
[58:33] that was not joseph
[58:35] the bible is saying here any amplified
[58:37] even though a slave
[58:38] a slave don't normally have wealth a
[58:41] slave is not typically enterprising
[58:44] a slave by definition is forced to work
[58:48] it is against your will but joseph in a
[58:51] situation of being forced to work
[58:53] and not having certain rights and not
[58:55] having certain privileges
[58:57] because as a slave you are denied rights
[58:59] as a slave you are denied privileges
[59:01] the bible is saying that the lord is
[59:03] with joseph and he even though a slave
[59:06] and i want that even though a slave to
[59:08] mean even though there's a limitation
[59:11] even though there's an obstacle even
[59:13] though there's something hindering you
[59:15] whatever it might be this even though a
[59:18] slave is in scripture
[59:19] to identify that the odds against you in
[59:22] some way
[59:23] there was a way and the scripture places
[59:27] the context of what it was
[59:29] the key to that was the lord was with
[59:31] joseph
[59:32] and i love to personalize this we have
[59:35] to know that the lord is with us
[59:37] it must be important to us that the lord
[59:40] is with us
[59:41] it must be our testimony that the lord
[59:44] is with us
[59:45] and i want us to highlight this as well
[59:47] because this is
[59:48] joseph is spiritual and natural so
[59:52] it is in his situation he is because the
[59:55] lord is with him
[59:56] everything around him is getting the
[59:58] benefits of it and we'll see it
[1:00:00] in a bit so verse 2 and the lord is with
[1:00:04] joseph
[1:00:05] and he was a prosperous man and he was
[1:00:08] in the house of his master the egyptian
[1:00:11] and his master verse 3 saw that the lord
[1:00:15] was with him
[1:00:16] and the lord made all
[1:00:19] if you were underlining i want to
[1:00:20] underline it would all
[1:00:22] the lord made all that he did to prosper
[1:00:25] in his hand
[1:00:27] that is a prophet there's someone you
[1:00:28] know it means everything joseph touch
[1:00:32] was blessed give me that kind of
[1:00:34] blessing
[1:00:36] that is not something so that's all that
[1:00:38] he did to prosper in his hand
[1:00:43] verse 4 and joseph found grace in his
[1:00:46] sight
[1:00:47] and he served him and he made him which
[1:00:50] is whatever made him oversee over his
[1:00:52] house
[1:00:53] and all that he had he put into his hand
[1:00:56] you see trust you see
[1:01:00] you see trust can you be trusted
[1:01:04] like this because what is promised to us
[1:01:07] in the spiritual realm
[1:01:10] with your sign he check your chest as
[1:01:12] good as the father and these kind of
[1:01:13] things that's a lot of trust in them
[1:01:22] in the amplified that verse 4 says so
[1:01:24] joseph pleased potiphar
[1:01:26] and found favor in his sight and he
[1:01:28] served him as his personal servant
[1:01:30] he made joseph oversee over his house
[1:01:34] and put all listen to this all that he
[1:01:38] owned in joseph's church
[1:01:43] so potiphar was so comfortable
[1:01:46] so confident in joseph's ability
[1:01:50] he had such complete trust in joseph
[1:01:53] that he could put all that he had into
[1:01:55] joseph hands
[1:01:56] it's not a wonderful thing
[1:02:02] verse 5 and it came to pass from the
[1:02:05] time that he had made him oversee in his
[1:02:06] house
[1:02:07] and over all that he had that the lord
[1:02:10] listen to this
[1:02:11] bless the egyptians house for joseph's
[1:02:13] sake
[1:02:16] wow so whatever
[1:02:20] captain of the royal guard in a hidden
[1:02:24] country serving a hidden king with all
[1:02:27] the idols and everything
[1:02:28] he in suddenly in a blessed house
[1:02:31] suddenly his house just blessed because
[1:02:34] of
[1:02:34] and and listen and it came to pass
[1:02:38] the blessing had a starting point you
[1:02:39] know
[1:02:41] the blessing wasn't when he brought
[1:02:42] joseph into the house
[1:02:44] the bible says and it came to pass from
[1:02:46] the time that he made him
[1:02:49] overseer in his house the moment he put
[1:02:51] joseph in charge the blessing flow
[1:02:54] somebody's in charge
[1:02:58] so so i want us to understand that god
[1:03:01] you know what they say but i say
[1:03:02] promotion
[1:03:03] is not from the eastern university boom
[1:03:04] post movies are coming lord
[1:03:06] there are some deep teachings in here
[1:03:08] that if you spend time
[1:03:09] slower than i am doing it and sit down
[1:03:12] and say wait a minute
[1:03:13] joseph have put himself there joseph
[1:03:16] didn't ask to be in egypt
[1:03:18] joseph is is there against his choice
[1:03:20] against his will
[1:03:21] but no matter what life deal him
[1:03:24] he has taken a certain approach to it
[1:03:26] unto the lord and
[1:03:28] he can't take credit for it because we
[1:03:30] read
[1:03:31] that in verse 3 his master saw that the
[1:03:34] lord was with him
[1:03:36] so joseph is not taking credit for
[1:03:38] anything i want us to appreciate that
[1:03:39] point
[1:03:41] so verse five when it came to pass from
[1:03:43] the time that he had made him oversee in
[1:03:45] his house
[1:03:45] and over all that he had the lord bless
[1:03:47] the egyptian house
[1:03:49] for joseph's sake and the blessing of
[1:03:51] the lord
[1:03:52] was upon all that he had in the house
[1:03:55] and in the field
[1:03:56] so because of joseph's presence
[1:03:58] everything potiphar had in the house and
[1:04:00] in the field was blessed
[1:04:02] that is that is real christianity you
[1:04:04] know why you're not a blessing just for
[1:04:06] yourself but but who you're coming to
[1:04:08] contact with
[1:04:09] your blessing you get a job and suddenly
[1:04:11] the business
[1:04:12] this is what i'm saying we we we are
[1:04:14] recession proof you know
[1:04:19] no i don't i i don't know i was a i cut
[1:04:22] it from my different clothes
[1:04:24] the god i serve listen people talk about
[1:04:26] the plan they're making reception we are
[1:04:27] recession proof
[1:04:31] you have to see that if you have a job
[1:04:33] now that the business that will hire you
[1:04:36] you will be the difference in that
[1:04:38] business
[1:04:40] because the lord is with you suddenly
[1:04:42] the business have the ability to provide
[1:04:44] for you
[1:04:46] and the business will get blessed
[1:04:48] because of you because the more blessed
[1:04:50] the business is is to bless you
[1:04:54] was being blessed and his boss was being
[1:04:56] blessed and the house was being blessed
[1:04:58] all because of the lord being with
[1:05:00] joseph
[1:05:02] anybody with me
[1:05:06] verse six as if god wants to make it
[1:05:09] crystal clear
[1:05:10] the extent he said and he left all that
[1:05:13] he had in joseph hand
[1:05:15] and he knew not what he had you know
[1:05:17] what that means
[1:05:18] potiphar so trusted joseph he wasn't
[1:05:21] checking the bank account
[1:05:22] he wasn't checking the the the goal
[1:05:25] account he wasn't checking nothing
[1:05:28] he knew not what he had he stopped
[1:05:30] checking
[1:05:33] what did i catch this he had such
[1:05:35] confidence and the blessing was so much
[1:05:37] he stopped checking what he have listen
[1:05:41] save the bread which he didn't eat in
[1:05:43] other words the only thing he had to
[1:05:44] check is the food
[1:05:45] meaning this is what i have to eat
[1:05:47] without all i need to know
[1:05:49] what is it that food on the table he
[1:05:51] does checking what he put on your plate
[1:05:53] he had to worry about nothing else talk
[1:05:55] about management
[1:05:56] so we see in here now that joseph was a
[1:05:59] manager
[1:06:01] so if i bring it to the business context
[1:06:04] and you want to be a ceo
[1:06:05] or you want to be a manager then joseph
[1:06:08] is one of the first examples in genesis
[1:06:11] of management in action because he was
[1:06:14] able to come
[1:06:15] at a very young age and take over the
[1:06:17] administration of the house
[1:06:19] of the fields of the servants of the
[1:06:21] bank account
[1:06:22] of the accounting of the records of the
[1:06:25] decision making
[1:06:26] in so much and the only decision
[1:06:27] potiphar has to make is what are eating
[1:06:29] today boy
[1:06:30] egg or cheese or peanut butter or jam
[1:06:32] the only decision i have to make
[1:06:34] because joseph running the house is what
[1:06:36] i eat today that's what the bible saying
[1:06:39] the hardest decision potiphar had to
[1:06:42] make is what to put in his bread
[1:06:45] which type of bread take it
[1:06:48] read the scripture that what the bible
[1:06:50] saying here he left all that
[1:06:52] let me find in the amplified
[1:06:55] so potiphar left all that he owned and
[1:06:57] joseph charged
[1:06:58] and with joseph there he did not need to
[1:07:01] pay attention
[1:07:02] to anything except the food he ate
[1:07:05] what a life think about it
[1:07:11] so we have all these concepts of joseph
[1:07:14] and this is why i want to challenge our
[1:07:16] understanding of scripture
[1:07:17] and what god expects from us
[1:07:21] because god expects us to be able to
[1:07:22] give an account he expects us to have
[1:07:24] some level of management he expects us
[1:07:26] to be able to communicate
[1:07:28] he expects us to be able to articulate
[1:07:30] he expects us to have trust in him
[1:07:32] he expects us to acknowledge him in all
[1:07:34] our ways he expects us to survive
[1:07:36] under pressure he expects us to throw
[1:07:38] back our shoulders
[1:07:39] against all odds he expects us to figure
[1:07:41] things out
[1:07:44] this is not a 40 year old man we're
[1:07:47] dealing with here
[1:07:48] this is a 60 year old man we're dealing
[1:07:50] with here this is a teenager we're
[1:07:51] dealing with here
[1:07:54] he didn't have 10 years work experience
[1:07:56] somebody preached to me
[1:07:57] he didn't have 20 years management
[1:07:58] experience and an mba from harvard
[1:08:01] but the lord was with him
[1:08:05] get me some managers that he lord with
[1:08:07] them and see what real management looks
[1:08:09] like
[1:08:10] because god is the best manager that
[1:08:11] there ever is ever
[1:08:13] had ever will be and if the lord is with
[1:08:15] you you don't need to have a degree
[1:08:17] anybody with me he is able to guide your
[1:08:21] part
[1:08:22] anybody with me tonight
[1:08:25] so again we find now we're going into
[1:08:28] verse seven
[1:08:29] where the pressure starts and the the
[1:08:31] test start and the
[1:08:32] temptation start and if we had time to
[1:08:36] compare this
[1:08:36] deeper with with genesis 38
[1:08:40] we will see the difference between judah
[1:08:42] and joseph
[1:08:43] because when the temptation came to
[1:08:45] judah
[1:08:47] he couldn't deal with the temptation
[1:08:49] that is what broke judah
[1:08:52] it is what unfolded what was in judah
[1:08:55] although god allowed it to unfold
[1:08:57] it shows the difference in character in
[1:08:59] judah to joseph
[1:09:02] joseph let's go to let's finish with six
[1:09:06] and he left all that he had in joseph
[1:09:08] hand
[1:09:08] and he knew not what he had saved the
[1:09:11] bread which he did peter love that
[1:09:12] i love that and joseph was a goodly
[1:09:15] person and well favored
[1:09:16] so i want to catch that last line there
[1:09:19] in
[1:09:20] in in the amplified so in the i said now
[1:09:23] joseph was handsome
[1:09:25] and attractive in form and appearance
[1:09:28] this brother jordan was blessed to know
[1:09:30] your manager your survivor
[1:09:32] your overcomer and you're handsome in
[1:09:35] the amplified they say attractive
[1:09:37] informant appearance
[1:09:38] so joseph is one name when you walk in
[1:09:40] the room you turn heads you're in charge
[1:09:42] you have a personality you ding ding
[1:09:44] ding
[1:09:44] charismatic this is joseph
[1:09:47] without the cause kind of person that
[1:09:49] you either love to love you love to hate
[1:09:53] verse seven and it came to pass after
[1:09:55] these things
[1:09:56] after he has proven himself as a manager
[1:09:59] after the blessing of the lord upon
[1:10:01] party for after everybody know that
[1:10:03] joseph whatever he touches bless
[1:10:05] that his master's wife cast her eyes
[1:10:07] upon joseph and she said lie with me
[1:10:09] but he refused that wasn't judah's
[1:10:12] position
[1:10:13] judah buckled under pressure
[1:10:16] verse 8 but he refused and said unto his
[1:10:18] master's wife
[1:10:19] behold my master wanted not
[1:10:23] what is with me in the house so to not
[1:10:26] get you confused with the english
[1:10:28] but he refused and said to his master's
[1:10:29] wife look with me
[1:10:31] in the house my master does not concern
[1:10:34] himself with anything
[1:10:36] he has put everything that he owns in my
[1:10:38] charge
[1:10:40] all right first nine there is none
[1:10:43] greater in this house than i
[1:10:46] in other words joseph is saying i have
[1:10:48] the highest rank in this house
[1:10:51] neither has he kept back anything from
[1:10:53] me but v
[1:10:54] in other words he is not greater than in
[1:10:58] this other than i am
[1:10:58] nor has he kept anything from me except
[1:11:01] you
[1:11:03] because thou art his wife how then can i
[1:11:05] do this great
[1:11:06] wickedness and sin against god
[1:11:10] in the amplified it says against god and
[1:11:12] your husband
[1:11:16] verse 10 and brother anthony had
[1:11:18] preached on this
[1:11:19] and it came to pass as she spoke to
[1:11:21] joseph
[1:11:22] day by day no no
[1:11:26] you see this testimony right here this
[1:11:28] is powerful
[1:11:29] the ambivalent said and so it was that
[1:11:32] she spoke to joseph
[1:11:33] persistently day after day
[1:11:36] we need some stronger christians with
[1:11:38] him
[1:11:40] yeah here we need some stronger
[1:11:42] christians i wish all the cameras were
[1:11:44] zoned
[1:11:46] i wish i could see everybody face
[1:11:50] because joseph by anointing
[1:11:53] but beyond anointing and beyond favor
[1:11:56] this is a decision that he made
[1:12:01] it is not one time it's not two times it
[1:12:04] is not cheating time
[1:12:06] every day she coming at him and he's
[1:12:09] saying no
[1:12:10] no no no no no
[1:12:15] and it keeps the possible this time
[1:12:19] and it came to pass bliss then as she
[1:12:21] speak to joseph david that he
[1:12:23] could not enter her he didn't give him
[1:12:25] to lie by her
[1:12:26] or to be with her scripture is really
[1:12:29] clear
[1:12:30] so so beside her so showing no kind of
[1:12:34] contact
[1:12:36] here sleep with her here lie down next
[1:12:39] to her
[1:12:39] yesterday cuddling there was no
[1:12:43] suspicion nothing could be attributed to
[1:12:46] him
[1:12:47] his he had a clean record
[1:12:50] to this point in time clean record
[1:12:53] nothing
[1:12:54] against joseph
[1:12:59] verse 11 and it came to pass about this
[1:13:02] time
[1:13:03] that joseph went into the house to do
[1:13:05] his business
[1:13:06] and there was none of the men of the
[1:13:07] house there within
[1:13:10] and she caught him by his garment saying
[1:13:13] lie with me and he left
[1:13:14] his garment in her hand and fled and got
[1:13:17] him
[1:13:18] out so it's two things he left the
[1:13:21] garment
[1:13:22] and two things he fled and got him out
[1:13:24] so
[1:13:25] when i read something like that i wasn't
[1:13:26] when he said because fled to me
[1:13:28] should be good enough like you fled but
[1:13:31] it says and got him out
[1:13:33] so i want to go and read in the
[1:13:35] amplified
[1:13:36] what that means so she called joseph by
[1:13:40] his outer robe saying lie with me
[1:13:42] but he left his robe in a hand and ran
[1:13:45] so as he fled
[1:13:46] and got outside as in literally exit he
[1:13:48] went and stand up in the yard
[1:13:51] he had just run he run out into the bush
[1:13:53] he wanted the forest he'd get out of it
[1:13:57] verse 13 and it came to pass when she
[1:13:59] saw that he had left his gamut in her
[1:14:00] hand
[1:14:01] and was fled forth that she called unto
[1:14:03] the men of her house
[1:14:05] no these are egyptians and speak unto
[1:14:08] them saying see
[1:14:09] he had brought in and hebrew and
[1:14:13] this hebrew context here is derogatory
[1:14:17] she is using it in a derogatory manner
[1:14:20] to demean joseph
[1:14:23] to pull joseph down it's like be is i
[1:14:25] calling him a name then
[1:14:28] see he had brought in a hebrew unto us
[1:14:30] the mockers
[1:14:31] so he came in on to me to lie with me
[1:14:33] and i cried with a loud voice
[1:14:35] and it came to pass when he heard that i
[1:14:36] lifted up my voice and cried
[1:14:38] but he left his garment with me and fled
[1:14:40] and got him out and she laid up his
[1:14:42] garment by her
[1:14:44] until his lord came home this woman is a
[1:14:46] piece of worker
[1:14:48] she hold on to the garment until imam
[1:14:51] come home
[1:14:51] she she i say she hold on for their life
[1:14:58] and she spake unto him according to
[1:15:00] these words
[1:15:01] saying at this point he's no longer
[1:15:04] joseph
[1:15:05] to her the hebrew servant which
[1:15:08] has brought unto us came in unto me to
[1:15:11] mock me
[1:15:12] and it came to pass as i lifted up my
[1:15:14] voice and cried that he left his garment
[1:15:16] with me and fled out
[1:15:17] and it came to pass when his master
[1:15:19] heard the words of his wife
[1:15:21] which is speaking to him saying after
[1:15:24] this manner did thy servant to me that
[1:15:25] his wrath was kindled
[1:15:27] so potiphar is angry and joseph master
[1:15:30] took him
[1:15:31] and put him into the prison so i find
[1:15:34] this was interesting as i read this
[1:15:37] a place where the king's prisoners were
[1:15:39] bound
[1:15:40] and he was there in the prison so joseph
[1:15:44] went to prison
[1:15:45] but the prison that he went to wasn't an
[1:15:48] ordinary prison
[1:15:53] he went into the king's prison
[1:15:57] which was reserved for those who were
[1:16:00] sentenced by the king
[1:16:04] where the king's prisoners were bound
[1:16:06] because no doubt
[1:16:07] understand the distinction here
[1:16:10] a slave is already a second-class
[1:16:14] citizen
[1:16:14] in the context of this if you want to
[1:16:16] imprison a slave or a servant
[1:16:18] you would have a different way of
[1:16:20] treating them than somebody that the
[1:16:22] king
[1:16:22] wants to treat a certain way and even by
[1:16:24] who was placed there who he encountered
[1:16:26] there
[1:16:26] the butler and the baker these were
[1:16:29] people who were of the king's court
[1:16:31] so to speak so he's in the king's prison
[1:16:34] and again verse 21
[1:16:35] but the lord was with joseph and it is
[1:16:38] as if
[1:16:39] as we know moses wrote this book right
[1:16:41] so moses is emphasizing
[1:16:43] through every situation through every
[1:16:46] turn in his life
[1:16:47] every corner joseph turned the lord is
[1:16:49] there
[1:16:50] wherever you put joseph the lord is
[1:16:52] there no matter what happened to joseph
[1:16:53] the lord is there
[1:16:55] and the lord
[1:16:59] was with joseph verse 21 and showed him
[1:17:01] mercy
[1:17:03] and gave him favor in the sight of the
[1:17:05] keeper of the prison
[1:17:07] and it's as if it keeps repeating itself
[1:17:09] it's as if joseph just gets in prime for
[1:17:11] more and more responsibility
[1:17:13] and the keeper of the prison committed
[1:17:16] to joseph han
[1:17:17] all the prisoners that were in the
[1:17:18] prison and whatsoever they did there he
[1:17:21] was the doer of it
[1:17:23] so it's as if when joseph enters
[1:17:24] somewhere whoever was running it
[1:17:26] could step back and let you over on it
[1:17:29] the keeper of the prison and if you
[1:17:32] wonder how clear that is
[1:17:33] verse 23 the keeper of the prison looked
[1:17:36] not to anything that was under his hand
[1:17:38] because the lord was with him and that
[1:17:40] which he did the lord made it to prosper
[1:17:42] so suddenly the prisoners have to
[1:17:44] prosper
[1:17:45] anybody with me could we take a little
[1:17:48] more
[1:17:52] chapter 40. and it came to pass after
[1:17:54] these things i'm going to speak to this
[1:17:56] because i want to get to the next
[1:17:57] section that the butler of the king
[1:17:59] and his baker had offended their lord
[1:18:02] the king of egypt
[1:18:03] it doesn't say what crime they committed
[1:18:04] they just said they offended in that day
[1:18:06] an
[1:18:06] offense was enough to get imprisoned so
[1:18:08] the king feared offended he said
[1:18:10] lock them up and fear was wrought
[1:18:12] against two of his officers
[1:18:14] against the chief of his battlers and
[1:18:16] against the chief of the bakers
[1:18:17] and he put them in ward in the house of
[1:18:19] the captain of the god into the prison
[1:18:21] the place where joseph was bound and the
[1:18:24] captain of the god
[1:18:25] called joseph and he served them and
[1:18:27] they continued that season so the
[1:18:28] captain regarded making no decision
[1:18:30] anymore he said joseph it'd have two new
[1:18:32] people to come in
[1:18:33] i needed to handle them and they dreamed
[1:18:36] the dream both of them each man is
[1:18:39] dreaming one night
[1:18:40] so in other words in the same night each
[1:18:42] man according to the
[1:18:43] interpretation of his dream so that
[1:18:46] simply means that the dream was specific
[1:18:48] to their situation
[1:18:50] the butler and the baker of the king of
[1:18:52] egypt which were bound in the prison
[1:18:55] and joseph came in unto them in the
[1:18:58] morning and looked upon them and behold
[1:19:00] they were sad and he asked for those
[1:19:03] officers that were with him in the ward
[1:19:04] of his lord's house saying
[1:19:05] wherefore lookee so sadly today why are
[1:19:08] they looking
[1:19:09] depressed anybody with me
[1:19:12] tonight and the second thing we have
[1:19:15] dreamed a dream
[1:19:16] and there's no interpreter of it and
[1:19:18] joseph said unto them
[1:19:20] do not interpretations belong to god
[1:19:23] tell me them i pray you
[1:19:25] and the chief butler told his dream to
[1:19:27] joseph and said to him in my dream
[1:19:29] behold a vine was before me and in the
[1:19:31] vine was
[1:19:32] three branches and it was as though it
[1:19:34] budded
[1:19:35] and her blossoms shot fought and the
[1:19:37] clusters thereof brought forth right
[1:19:39] grapes
[1:19:40] and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i
[1:19:42] took the grapes pressed them into
[1:19:44] pharaoh's cup
[1:19:44] and i gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
[1:19:47] and joseph said unto him
[1:19:48] this is the interpretation of it the
[1:19:50] three branches are three days
[1:19:53] yet within three days shall pharaoh lift
[1:19:55] up thine head
[1:19:56] and restore thee into thy place and thou
[1:19:59] shall deliver
[1:20:00] fear was cup into his hand after the
[1:20:02] former manner
[1:20:03] wendell was his butler in other words
[1:20:05] you're going to be restored
[1:20:06] what you had before coming back to you
[1:20:10] and joseph putting in his own personal
[1:20:12] request now
[1:20:14] and this is he said but think on me
[1:20:17] when it shall be well with thee and show
[1:20:20] kindness i pray thee unto me
[1:20:22] and make mention of me unto pharaoh and
[1:20:25] bring me out of this house
[1:20:27] so joseph is prospering but joseph went
[1:20:30] out he said listen
[1:20:31] i'm giving you i tell you you're going
[1:20:32] you're going out in three days you're
[1:20:33] going out when they get out remember me
[1:20:35] tell them a story and to see how real it
[1:20:38] is for joseph
[1:20:40] and and if you get to it i don't know if
[1:20:41] tonight next week when
[1:20:43] the emotion has locked up in joseph it's
[1:20:45] a lot he's young he's still very young
[1:20:48] he's experiencing all of this at a very
[1:20:51] very young age
[1:20:52] he said think on me when all is good
[1:20:54] with you
[1:20:55] and show kindness i pray the unto me
[1:20:58] and make mention in other words make a
[1:21:01] petition to pharaoh about me
[1:21:03] and bring me out of this house for
[1:21:05] indeed listen
[1:21:06] i was stolen away out of the land of the
[1:21:09] hebrews
[1:21:10] and here also i have done nothing that
[1:21:12] they should put me into the dungeon
[1:21:15] and this here friends is a really
[1:21:17] profound deep deep
[1:21:19] deep deep deep statement i have done
[1:21:22] nothing
[1:21:23] that they should put me into the dungeon
[1:21:25] if it's
[1:21:26] one person in scripture that we could
[1:21:29] say should i be depressed was joseph
[1:21:32] many of us go into our low moments for
[1:21:35] things that we did
[1:21:38] and we regret what we did and we look
[1:21:40] back and see mistakes we make and we say
[1:21:42] oh gosh everybody do it differently
[1:21:44] but joseph is different he under
[1:21:46] pressure for something he didn't do
[1:21:50] so you have to have a certain that does
[1:21:52] something to you
[1:21:53] when you're there and you didn't do
[1:21:54] anything and you don't reserve it to
[1:21:56] know
[1:21:58] you know what a brand i'm preaching
[1:21:59] about when somebody says something about
[1:22:01] you
[1:22:01] you're already dead to the world when
[1:22:03] when you don't respond
[1:22:06] you know you say if if if somebody say
[1:22:08] you're a lion and you
[1:22:09] you in the casting i'm saying no it
[1:22:10] wasn't me i didn't lie he said you died
[1:22:12] yet
[1:22:13] you were ready yet so joseph was going
[1:22:16] through an experience
[1:22:18] because he didn't do anything he already
[1:22:20] had to die out you know
[1:22:23] is a deep dying out that joseph had to
[1:22:25] go to
[1:22:27] because the way joseph is sounding now
[1:22:30] is not like the joseph
[1:22:31] who spoke to his brothers when he was 17
[1:22:33] years old
[1:22:36] this joseph because in the amplified
[1:22:40] it actually said he had a arrogance
[1:22:42] about his tone
[1:22:44] at 17 where he dreams no
[1:22:47] he's not talking about no dreams here
[1:22:49] you know
[1:22:51] he is confronting the reality of his
[1:22:53] present situation
[1:22:54] and said i've done nothing and they put
[1:22:56] me in this dungeon i was told away
[1:22:58] say a word for me please he's
[1:23:01] so i just wanted to catch that and i
[1:23:04] love this part verse 16
[1:23:06] is almost it's unfolds so so the butler
[1:23:10] get her a wonderful wonderful
[1:23:12] interpretation
[1:23:13] the butler's smiling the butler feel the
[1:23:16] weight lift off his shoulder
[1:23:18] you know it's like you had a dream boy
[1:23:19] and well i was wondering about this you
[1:23:21] know i didn't well
[1:23:22] brother joseph spoke to me and i feel a
[1:23:24] level of relief
[1:23:26] when i found out what my dream mean so
[1:23:30] moses says here in verse 16 when the
[1:23:33] chief baker
[1:23:34] saw that the interpretation was good
[1:23:37] when you read that and he processed that
[1:23:39] you can see the emotion of the baker
[1:23:41] going through it when he see that he
[1:23:43] he fellow prisoner gets a good report he
[1:23:46] would have approached a certain level of
[1:23:47] eagerness
[1:23:48] to get his good report to her so he
[1:23:51] excited
[1:23:52] i wanted to see the drama unfolding when
[1:23:54] the chief breaker saw that the
[1:23:55] interpretation was good
[1:23:57] he said unto joseph i also was in my
[1:23:59] dream you know
[1:24:00] and behold i had three white baskets on
[1:24:03] my head
[1:24:04] and in the uppermost basket there was
[1:24:05] all manner of baker of baked meats with
[1:24:07] hero
[1:24:08] and the birds that eat them out off of
[1:24:10] the back up on my hand
[1:24:12] and joseph anthony said this is the
[1:24:14] interpretation thereof the three baskets
[1:24:16] are three days
[1:24:18] so i can imagine at this point the baker
[1:24:20] is feeling positive
[1:24:22] he said this song in just like the
[1:24:23] butler testimony because so far there's
[1:24:26] nothing to suggest
[1:24:27] any deviation from joseph bringing out a
[1:24:29] positive direction
[1:24:33] yet within three days shall pharaoh lift
[1:24:35] up thy head from of thee
[1:24:37] and shall hungry on a tree and the bird
[1:24:39] shall eat thy flesh of thee
[1:24:43] and it came to pass the third day which
[1:24:44] was pharaoh's birthday
[1:24:46] that he made a feast onto all his
[1:24:48] servants and he lifted up the head of
[1:24:50] the chief butler
[1:24:51] and the chief baker among his servants
[1:24:53] and he restored the chief butler onto
[1:24:55] his butler ship
[1:24:56] again and he gave the cup in the
[1:24:58] pharaoh's hand and he hung the chief
[1:25:00] baker
[1:25:01] as joseph had interpreted to them yet
[1:25:03] did not the chief butler remember joseph
[1:25:06] but forgot him
[1:25:10] so joseph is still there in prison and
[1:25:12] he's forgotten
[1:25:13] i don't want to be too much longer again
[1:25:14] tonight verse
[1:25:17] chapter 41 but but i want you to notice
[1:25:19] we talk about joseph there are there are
[1:25:21] few
[1:25:21] characters in scripture that this amount
[1:25:24] of time is taken to express their story
[1:25:27] when you already look through the
[1:25:29] characters in scripture how much time is
[1:25:31] spent on gideon and different ones and
[1:25:33] and isaac and and and and spent
[1:25:35] describing even elements of elijah
[1:25:38] this is joseph growing up in front of us
[1:25:40] as well similar to
[1:25:41] how we we can see david as a boy and as
[1:25:44] a king and as a father and
[1:25:45] and as an old man on his bed this is
[1:25:47] joseph's story dr we know joseph said
[1:25:49] take my bones
[1:25:51] with you right and it came to pass at
[1:25:54] the end of two full years that pharaoh
[1:25:55] dreamed and behold he stood by the river
[1:25:58] and behold they came out of the river
[1:26:00] seven well favored this is cow
[1:26:02] fat flesh and they fed in the meadow and
[1:26:04] behold seven came up
[1:26:05] out of the river ill favor and lean
[1:26:07] flesh and stood by the other kind upon
[1:26:10] the brink of the river
[1:26:11] and the ill favored and the lean flesh
[1:26:13] kinda eat up the seven well favored and
[1:26:16] fat kind
[1:26:16] so pharaoh awoke and he slept and
[1:26:19] dreamed his second time to the first
[1:26:20] dream
[1:26:21] seven fat cows and then seven lean cows
[1:26:24] the seven lean cows ate the fat ones
[1:26:28] it shook him out of his sleep and he
[1:26:30] slept and dreamed his second time
[1:26:32] and behold seven ears of corn come up
[1:26:35] from one stalk
[1:26:36] rank and good and behold 17 ones blasted
[1:26:39] with the east wind
[1:26:40] sprung up after them and the 17 ears
[1:26:42] devoured the seven rank and full ears
[1:26:44] and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a
[1:26:46] dream
[1:26:47] and it came to pass in the morning that
[1:26:49] his spirit was troubled
[1:26:51] he knew this had significance he knew
[1:26:53] this was important
[1:26:55] and i wanted to understand again the
[1:26:56] context that we also tracking the
[1:26:59] genealogy of this thing
[1:27:01] that the whole reason this is unfolding
[1:27:02] is to preserve life
[1:27:04] and a specific line of life as well all
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:09] that his spirit was troubled and he sent
[1:27:11] and called for all the magicians of
[1:27:13] egypt
[1:27:14] and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh
[1:27:16] told them his dream but there was none
[1:27:18] that could interpret them under pharaoh
[1:27:21] then speak the chief butler onto pharaoh
[1:27:24] and saying i do remember my faults this
[1:27:26] day
[1:27:27] that statement is interesting that do
[1:27:29] remember my false disney
[1:27:32] in the in the amplified it says it like
[1:27:34] this
[1:27:35] then the chief cabrera spoke the pharaoh
[1:27:38] saying i would mention my faults today
[1:27:40] in other words
[1:27:41] when the butler was restored in a civil
[1:27:43] butler never talk about what he did to
[1:27:45] go into prison
[1:27:47] the butler didn't do as everyday happen
[1:27:50] so
[1:27:50] when this happened now we say listen
[1:27:52] well i want to bring back to your memory
[1:27:53] if you remember when i didn't mess up
[1:27:55] two years ago so he said i would bring
[1:27:58] back
[1:27:58] to your memory what was the situation
[1:28:01] that i was in
[1:28:02] and what it led me to and and uh
[1:28:07] pharaoh was wrought with a silver and
[1:28:08] put me in the water the captain of the
[1:28:10] guards house both me and the chief maker
[1:28:12] and we dreamed that dream in one night i
[1:28:14] and he we dream
[1:28:15] each man according to the interpretation
[1:28:17] of his dream
[1:28:19] and there was there with us a young man
[1:28:21] you see how they see joseph there's a
[1:28:22] young man
[1:28:23] and hebrew servant to the captain of the
[1:28:26] god and we told him
[1:28:27] and he interpreted to us our dreams to
[1:28:29] each man according to his dream he
[1:28:31] didn't interpret
[1:28:32] and it came to pass as he interpreted to
[1:28:35] us
[1:28:35] so it was me he restored into my office
[1:28:38] and him he hanged
[1:28:39] and pharaoh sent and called joseph and
[1:28:42] they brought him hastily out of the
[1:28:44] dudgeon
[1:28:44] and he shaved himself and changed his
[1:28:47] raiment
[1:28:48] and he came into pharaoh and pharaoh
[1:28:51] said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream
[1:28:53] and there is none that could interpret
[1:28:54] it and i have heard say of thee that
[1:28:57] thou can't understand a dream to
[1:28:58] interpret it
[1:28:59] and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is
[1:29:01] not in me
[1:29:02] again i want us a note that at no point
[1:29:05] in time
[1:29:06] joseph ever claimed to do anything he
[1:29:09] always put it back on god
[1:29:13] god shall give pharaoh an answer of
[1:29:15] peace so
[1:29:16] notice joseph didn't even say god will
[1:29:19] use me to give the answer
[1:29:22] he was completely dedicated to
[1:29:25] acknowledging god
[1:29:26] so he was that this is this is what the
[1:29:28] lord gave me to give you he wasn't even
[1:29:30] seeing him like that
[1:29:31] i want this to catch this subtle subtle
[1:29:33] messaging here right
[1:29:34] and pharaoh son of the joseph in my
[1:29:35] dream behold i stood in the bank of the
[1:29:37] river and he basically repeats it behold
[1:29:39] they came up to the river seven fat cows
[1:29:41] and they fed on the meadow and behold
[1:29:43] seven
[1:29:44] lean and it goes on and behold seven
[1:29:46] years and it goes on
[1:29:48] to verse 25 and joseph said unto pharaoh
[1:29:51] the dream of pharaoh is one in other
[1:29:53] words
[1:29:54] the cause and the stalk and everything
[1:29:56] is really one dream
[1:29:58] god has showed pharaoh what he's about
[1:30:00] to do
[1:30:03] now i want us to catch his friends
[1:30:05] abraham
[1:30:06] isaac jacob and jacob has 12 sons
[1:30:11] jacob is in no position to take of his
[1:30:13] family during the famine
[1:30:16] if god showed jacob what was about to
[1:30:18] take place
[1:30:19] he couldn't preserve the family he
[1:30:21] didn't have the resources the greenery
[1:30:23] the facilities the land
[1:30:25] so god is using egypt
[1:30:29] to store food to preserve his children i
[1:30:32] want to take care of these small things
[1:30:33] right
[1:30:36] so the dream of pharaoh is one
[1:30:40] god had showed pharaoh what he's about
[1:30:43] to do
[1:30:43] the seven good kind of seven years and
[1:30:45] the seven good years are seven years
[1:30:47] the dream is won and the seventh thin
[1:30:49] and ill-favored kind that came up after
[1:30:51] them are seven years
[1:30:53] and the seven empty years blasted with
[1:30:55] the east wing shall be seven years of
[1:30:56] famine
[1:30:57] this is the thing which i have spoken
[1:30:59] unto pharaoh what god is about to do he
[1:31:02] show it unto pharaoh
[1:31:03] behold there comes seven years of great
[1:31:06] plenty
[1:31:07] throughout all the land of egypt and
[1:31:08] they shall arise after them seven years
[1:31:10] of famine
[1:31:11] and all the plenty shall be forgotten in
[1:31:14] the land of egypt
[1:31:15] and the farmer shall consume the land
[1:31:18] and the plenty shall not be known in the
[1:31:20] land by reason of that famine following
[1:31:22] for it will be very grievous and for
[1:31:25] that
[1:31:25] the dream was doubled under pharaoh
[1:31:28] joseph saying because
[1:31:29] god the reason that you got a dream
[1:31:31] twice it is because the thing is
[1:31:33] established by god
[1:31:35] and god will shortly bring it to pass in
[1:31:37] other words this is guaranteed to happen
[1:31:40] now therefore look at this young man
[1:31:42] speaking now
[1:31:43] now again this is joseph he's a wrong
[1:31:46] feast like 30 years old now so it's 13
[1:31:49] years
[1:31:50] from him being sold into slavery at 8
[1:31:53] 17.
[1:31:54] he's now 30 years old let pharaoh do
[1:31:57] this and let him know
[1:32:00] verse 3 now therefore let pharaoh look
[1:32:03] out a man discreet and wise
[1:32:05] and set him over the land of egypt
[1:32:08] let pharaoh do this and let him appoint
[1:32:10] officers over the land
[1:32:12] and take up the fifth part of the land
[1:32:14] of egypt
[1:32:15] in the seven plenty of years in other
[1:32:16] words twenty percent
[1:32:18] of the fruit of the land you will
[1:32:19] collect it as taxes over these seven
[1:32:21] years
[1:32:22] and let them gather all the food of
[1:32:24] those good years that come
[1:32:25] and lay up corn under the hand of
[1:32:27] pharaoh and let them keep food in the
[1:32:29] cities
[1:32:30] and that food shall be a store
[1:32:34] to the land against his seven years of
[1:32:35] famine which shall be in the land of
[1:32:37] egypt
[1:32:38] and the land perished not through the
[1:32:40] farm that the land perished not
[1:32:42] to the famine and the thing was good in
[1:32:44] the eyes of pharaoh
[1:32:46] and in the eyes of all his servants i'm
[1:32:48] getting ready to
[1:32:49] to close up and pharaoh said unto his
[1:32:51] servants can we find such a one as this
[1:32:54] a man in whom the spirit of god is in
[1:32:57] the amplified
[1:32:59] pharaoh was actually so he wasn't seeing
[1:33:02] a man like this
[1:33:03] as in what joseph described in the
[1:33:05] amplified the bible said
[1:33:06] so pharaoh said to his servants can we
[1:33:09] find a man like this
[1:33:10] and he was speaking to this as in jesus
[1:33:12] specifically
[1:33:13] a man equal to joseph so joseph
[1:33:16] described the man
[1:33:18] and phil was saying can we find a man
[1:33:20] like joseph
[1:33:21] in whom is the divine god all right
[1:33:24] so pharaoh said unto his sermon can we
[1:33:26] find such a one as this a man in whom
[1:33:28] the spirit of god is
[1:33:30] so he already identified joseph as the
[1:33:32] type of the man he looking for
[1:33:35] and pharaoh said unto joseph as much as
[1:33:37] god had showed thee all this
[1:33:39] there is none so discreet and wise as to
[1:33:41] what
[1:33:42] and listen to the proclamation now thou
[1:33:45] shalt be over my house
[1:33:47] and according unto thy word shall all my
[1:33:50] people be
[1:33:51] ruled only in the throne will i be
[1:33:54] greater than thou
[1:33:56] you talk about establishing authority
[1:33:57] and power
[1:33:59] and pharaoh stand under jesus see i have
[1:34:01] set thee over or the land of egypt
[1:34:04] and pharaoh took off his ring from his
[1:34:07] hand
[1:34:07] and put it upon joseph's hand and
[1:34:10] arrayed him in vestiges of fine linen
[1:34:12] and put a gold chain about his neck and
[1:34:15] he made him to ride
[1:34:16] in the second chariot which he had
[1:34:19] i don't know how much other chariots
[1:34:21] that pharaoh had but
[1:34:23] pharaoh had the first chariot and joseph
[1:34:25] had his second chariot
[1:34:27] and they cried before him bow the knee
[1:34:30] and he made him a ruler over all the
[1:34:33] land of egypt
[1:34:35] and verse 44 i love verse 44
[1:34:39] and pharaoh said unto joseph i am
[1:34:41] pharaoh and without
[1:34:43] be shall no man lift up his hand
[1:34:46] or foot in all the land of egypt in the
[1:34:49] amplified
[1:34:50] it says moreover pharaoh said to joseph
[1:34:53] though i am pharaoh yet without
[1:34:56] your permission shall no man raise his
[1:34:59] hand to do
[1:35:00] anything or set his foot to go anywhere
[1:35:03] in all the land of egypt all classes of
[1:35:06] people
[1:35:06] shall submit to your authority
[1:35:13] this is something i'll say mind blowing
[1:35:14] it and pharaoh called joseph's name
[1:35:18] zafnat paneer and gave him to wife asana
[1:35:21] the daughter of
[1:35:22] potiphara priest of on and joseph went
[1:35:25] out over all the land of egypt
[1:35:27] and joseph was 30 years old when he
[1:35:30] stood before pharaoh
[1:35:31] king of egypt and joseph went out from
[1:35:34] the presence of pharaoh
[1:35:35] and went through all the land of egypt
[1:35:37] and in the seven
[1:35:38] plenteous years the earth brought forth
[1:35:40] by handfuls
[1:35:42] and he gathered up all the food of the
[1:35:44] seven years which were in the land of
[1:35:46] egypt
[1:35:46] and laid up the food in the cities the
[1:35:48] food of the field
[1:35:49] which was round about every city laid he
[1:35:52] up in the stream
[1:35:53] and joseph gathered corn as the sand of
[1:35:56] the sea
[1:35:56] very much until he left numbering you
[1:35:59] know we stopped counting
[1:36:01] for it was without number and unto
[1:36:04] joseph was born two sons
[1:36:05] before the years of famine kim which
[1:36:08] asana the daughter
[1:36:09] of potiphara wise wife a priest of one
[1:36:12] day unto him
[1:36:13] and joseph called the name of the force
[1:36:14] born manasseh
[1:36:17] you know the tribe of manasseh for god
[1:36:19] said he had made me forget all my toil
[1:36:23] and all my father's house and the name
[1:36:26] of the second called ephraim
[1:36:28] for god had caused me to be fruitful in
[1:36:30] the land of my affliction
[1:36:33] and the seven years of plenteousness
[1:36:35] that was in the land of egypt were
[1:36:37] and the seven years of death began to
[1:36:39] come according as joseph had said
[1:36:42] and that was in all the lands but in all
[1:36:44] the land of egypt there was bread
[1:36:46] and when all the land of egypt was
[1:36:47] famished the people cried to pharaoh for
[1:36:50] bread
[1:36:50] and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians
[1:36:53] go unto joseph
[1:36:54] when he said to what he said to you do
[1:36:57] and the famine was over all the face of
[1:36:59] the earth
[1:37:00] and joseph opened up all the storehouses
[1:37:03] and sold
[1:37:03] unto the egyptians and the famine wax
[1:37:06] saw in the land of egypt
[1:37:08] and all the countries came into egypt
[1:37:10] and joseph to buy corn
[1:37:11] because that the famine was so so in all
[1:37:13] lands
[1:37:14] we will pause here tonight may the lord
[1:37:17] have a blessing in the reading of his
[1:37:18] word
[1:37:18] we will have to finish this because i
[1:37:20] need to tie this all together and the
[1:37:22] unfolding of joseph
[1:37:23] to his brethren and uh i trust that you
[1:37:26] were blessed tonight
[1:37:27] and we will see how this connects to the
[1:37:29] new testament
[1:37:30] and when we get back into the book of
[1:37:31] revelation i don't want to kind of pick
[1:37:33] these things
[1:37:34] up to map these things out as well so
[1:37:36] can we bow our heads a word of prayer
[1:37:38] heavenly father we thank you tonight
[1:37:40] lord for this time of fellowship around
[1:37:43] your word

[1:37:47] some time in the book of genesis around
[1:37:49] joseph and we know
[1:37:50] that joseph was a type lord of christ
[1:37:53] lord and
[1:37:54] hate without a cause nothing against

[1:38:38] accident with you

[1:38:44] being carted away to egypt
[1:38:46] he didn't understand he didn't he
[1:38:48] realized he was in anguish
[1:38:50] he was in pain and by the grace of god
[1:38:52] we'd see all that unfold
[1:38:53] how emotional he would have been how
[1:38:55] emotional he still was in his later
[1:38:57] years when he still could have
[1:38:58] reminisced the pain of his experience
[1:39:00] but he could look back and see how you
[1:39:03] kept him all along
[1:39:04] and there was a bigger plan there was a
[1:39:05] bigger purpose there was a plan of
[1:39:07] redemption
