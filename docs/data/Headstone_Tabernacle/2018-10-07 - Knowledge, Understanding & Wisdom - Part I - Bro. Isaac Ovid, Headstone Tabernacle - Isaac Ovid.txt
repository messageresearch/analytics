Heavenly Father Lord we come to your sacred throne in your presence this morning as Lord unworthy sons and daughters if it wasn't for your blood and your grace we wouldn't stand a chance but you created a provision you created away you created an access for us to Lord reach into the heavenlies and make a withdrawal from the bank of glory father and law we have a son do us place a request for

precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and the church say Amen let's just sing that song moving this place today move in this video today [Music] this has my one diesel that you would have [Music] it's not me and I will Bevis [Music] today whoa [Music] move in this place take over this place love this has my desire that you would have trust me and I won't be the same [Music] today so I welcome you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to four portions of Scripture I like to read from Isaiah 55 reading from Romans 12 reading from Philippians 2 and we'll come back to proverbs chapter 4 reading from Isaiah 55 and reading from this eat for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts reading Romans 12 and reading from verse 2 Romans 12 and reading verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and reading from Philippians chapter 2 and reading verse 5 Philippians chapter 2 reading verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and our last reading will be from the book of Proverbs chapter 4 hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding for I give you good doctrine for sake he not my law for I was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my Commandments and live get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsaken not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote the she shall bring me to honor window does embrace her she shall give to nine had an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall he deliver shall she deliver to thee here all my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many I have thought P in the way of wisdom I have let me in right paths when thou goest thou step-by-step shall not be straightened when the run is thou shall not stumble take fast hall of instructions let her not go keep off or she is thy life may the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated this morning a man we're so happy to be here this morning in the presence of the Lord and we had a really tremendous time in the youth service yesterday for those who missed it the young people and by extension the church is welcome to join the young people we are in the book of Proverbs and the young people stood up yesterday and made a commitment before God to study the entire book of Proverbs during the remain of this year during this October November and December was the left of 2018 to study in depth the book of Proverbs and we spend some time going through proverbs 1 and it was really a tremendous time and over the last few weeks or so I've been meditating not just on proverbs but on the magnitude of the wisdom of God and the understanding of God and the knowledge of God and what God requires from us and for what it takes for us to be compatible with him and we'll go to some quotes from the Prophet but I do have a thought this morning title and my title is knowledge understanding and wisdom part 1 knowledge understanding and wisdom part 1 now we know that God is a spirit and because God is a spirit he has to find a way to introduce themselves to himself to us so that we could relate so when God speaks the man or comes to meet man or uses examples of man he has to find a way to almost break it down to us because he is bigger than our understanding he said my thoughts are not your thoughts tear down my ways your way as far as the heavens are higher than here it saw my thoughts I had and your thoughts and we have talked many times about this great omnipotent omniscient all-powerful God who had this great desire to reveal himself so true all the ages he could have only revealed himself in part so he was partly expressing himself as Abraham he was partly expressing himself through Joshua he was partly expressing himself through David he was partly expressing themselves realiza he was partly expressing himself through Isaiah he was partly expressing himself through Habakkuk he was partly expressing himself through JoEllen every prophet every man of God that was touching your Testament was merely a shadow was merely a piece of this great puzzle so to speak this great mystery that was God he could not ever feel himself all at once because it would have been too much he had to take time and he had to use different people at different times to reveal himself can the church say man but when we talk about the mind of God going to use a lot of examples he said the heaven is my throne any earth is my footstool because he knows we can relate to a throne and a footstool she uses the examples that are near to us can the church amen that we can relate to so he said when the angel came in revelation 10 he said his face was as it were the son it doesn't mean his face was a son it was as it were his son because God knows you could relate to a son you know what a son looks like sup he's using examples he's using analogies he's using parables to try to take this great majesty of God and break it down to our understanding can the church say man everybody with me this morning don't worry this morning we're gonna have Sun near school so relax we're gonna have Sunday school this morning we're gonna go back to ABC's this morning for the young people who were here it's gonna be a revision of what we did yesterday and for those who were not here you'd be a a wonderful time so you're gonna have a wonderful time together this morning have a chance amen but we here by this mind of Christ and we read the scripture let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and Peter conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God can the church say man but there's something about his mind this great mind of God that he could even see there be some people who could have the mind of Christ that's a powerful statement when we talk about the mind of Christ we're not talking about the biological construction so we're not talking about a frontal lobe or pituitary gland or the amygdala it's something greater than biology we're not talking about the chemical mind of God the neural electrical synapses we are talking greater than chemistry greater than biology we are talking about an eternal God finding a way to press himself into what would seem to normal beings but the only way they could be a compatible or a transfer is because we could be eternal also in fact we are also trapped in time had it not been that we bypass the theophany we would have understood more than we understand we wouldn't know more than we know but God allowed us to bypass off the opening to come down and sit on either to prove to the devil despite our sickness despite our pains despite our tiredness despite our depression despite what we go through the attribute of God that is invisible to the human eye is greater than the problems that we face and the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and I get a witness in the house tonight and the church say man oh so we're going back to basics because we are a word church and a word church means we are peace in the Holy Scriptures and the revealed word has brought by a seventh angel messenger right as time the right hand of God oh who brought a message to bring clarity to the areas that seem blurry in Scripture God was taking no chances to leave it up to our interpretation so he sent a prophet up to make sure that you know who you are you know what you are born to do you know what you are born to accomplish and the devil cannot deceive you because you have a confidence not in yourself but a confidence in God a confidence not because you're a church member but our confidence in the DNA in the attribute in the woods seed in your soul because when the Benham taught us you are not even a believer but the word seed in you that's the believer and that believer in you that would see cannot get tired that word seed in your soul I don't get the press up that word seed in your soul Jesus was tired and aborted but when they walked Jesus up the genetic holder the power that was locked up even though he was asleep and cousin that help but express itself the same peace be still or somebody help me preacher spawning hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise you're not gonna get nothing unless you're in his spirit oh and John said oh he was caught up in the spirit so we want to be in a spirit this morning because we want to catch the mind of God we want to have his fault you want to think his thoughts [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh my feels good this morning feels like something that's happening this morning it's invisible to the naked eye it's supposed to be invisible to the naked eye mahalo lujah and if you're not seeing something this morning you need to open up your eyes and small them to see that they are more fighting against you don't let your problems you know your worship don't let the situation in know your worship don't let your trials you know your worship don't what that happen this morning you know your worship don't know what happened yesterday you know your worship your worship has nothing to do it what is temporal your worship was all to do with what is eternal and eternal God and eternal father and eternal King not just the king but king of kings not just a lord but lord of lords oh he is Jehovah Jireh he is Jehovah Rapha he is your home initiate he is the same yesterday today and forever he is bigger than your problem bigger than your situation bigger than the pains in your body bigger than the high blood pressure up bigger than the low blood pressure up bigger than the other righteous bigger than that line I dig it on your children giving trouble bigger than no money in your bank account bigger than the pills you can't pay he is bigger he is bigger he is caught all by himself [Applause] [Music] he's a quality impossible hallelujah I don't care what the situation is he is a gotta be impossible hallelujah hallelujah so let this mine that was in Christ being you that's what we're talking about we're talking about change of thinking let that mind it is impossible for the mind of Christ to be in you and you operate the same way that you did yesterday somebody preach back to me oh when we are born we are born with our own thinking we are born with our own understanding Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child when I became a man that becoming a man was not just in natural age it was the maturity that comes with being a man he said I put away the choice things up but when you come into Christ you are thinking like a baby you are speaking like a baby but we are called to maturity and the moment your you become and someone you think like him and someone you speak like him and some more you walk like him somebody preached back to me you may be seated now the mind is what controls your body your hand does nothing unless your mind does it everybody with me for your feet to move your brain must send an instruction so your behavior the moment your mind changes your behavior changes when you feel in your foot walking into places you shouldn't go the problem is not your feet the problem is your mind the hook somebody help me this morning when you go in friends you shouldn't go with the problem is that you're what the problem is is your mind is the problem but the Bible says be transformed the transformation comes by the rebooting or the renewing order is sitting or the recalibrate think of your mind of your thinking not a better form of your thinking what he is thinking or somebody help me you maybe see them that's why we're not reaching education this morning we're not reaching intellectual stimulation this morning we are speaking to getting plug into the hard drive and the CPU that's up in heaven and you talk loaded a new operating system when this operation Oh somebody helped me this boy when this operating system when when you get this upgrade you can do more than you ever did before when you get this upgrade somebody please back to me [Applause] may be seated computers upgrade software upgrade foon's of grid whatsapp has an upgrade every single program they are trying to improve but the Branham criticized the church he said we went through horse and buggy we went through cow we went through aeroplane there will be two rocket but he just want to be still driving horse and buggy when will the church upgraded system its operating system because when your operating system upgrade you move faster when your operating system upgrade your phone you want to do more than it did before or come on somebody please back to me you can take our old phone but the better system and the phone operates differently and you might be long in the message but if you get a reboot of your system a new heart a new spirit er yes spirit all of a sudden the Honda didn't list before you recognizes a new life there's a new igniter there's a new inspiration there's a new incentive function hallelujah you may be seated I had to title in spot one I'm not telling you when part two is gonna be but I know it's impossible to speak of the knowledge understanding and wisdom of God in one service this might be a chilly on 65 pass series I don't know because God is infinite there is no limit to what he could do there was not a little bit of his knowledge there's no limit of is understanding there's no limit of his wisdom able to reach you in your situation I don't know how we can preach about this in one service it's everyday we can talk about how his grace how he understood how God to not depend on anybody drop down from eternity to step in the time to feel what it is to be hungry to feel what it is to be tired we get an understanding of what it is when you're tired and he gave understanding of what it is when you are hungry could Anita be touched by the feeling of our infirmities honey can I tell if I owe somebody help me this morning everything that you go through he went through tiredness he went through there's nothing that you could ever go through that he is not taking Elijah's word for it he's not taking Moses his word for it he went through it himself so he understands he's a friend of a wounded heart because his heart was wounded somebody helped me this morning he know what it is when friends betray him he had expected more of pizza but Peter went to sleep couldn't you watch with me for one hour he knows what it is and it is with that knowledge and with it is with that understanding and it is with that wisdom that he puts things in place not based on what you will want but what you need or somebody helped me this morning so I'm not preaching this morning we have a Sunday school this morning have your Bibles gonna touch a little bit of an exercise with Abel to young people yesterday proverbs chapter one from verse one proverbs chapter one and verse one the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity to give certainty that is simple to the young man knowledge and discretion and the scripture begins to help us a wise man will hear and will increase learning so one of the attributes of a wise man is that he will hear I will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings now I wanna focus on the scripture here as I did with young people the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction I want to read it one more time the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction and I've been meditating on this structure we spend some time on it with young people yesterday because we're speaking about knowledge understanding and wisdom you cannot have wisdom without knowledge because wisdom is the application of knowledge there are people who have knowledge and no understanding so true out proverbs and throughout the scriptures when you read it to Bible speaks of three things knowledge understanding and wisdom and it's all connected and we read the scripture in Proverbs that the principal thing is wisdom and even when Paul speaks of the nine spiritual gifts he speaks of wisdom being the first of the spiritual gifts and the church say man so you have to have understanding you have to have knowledge now knowledge is knowing so you can know something I not understand so you know that if you put something here and let it go it falls and not understand that why it's falling so you know it falls and then understanding tells you there's a law of gravity and no wisdom is how do you apply the this knowledge and understanding you have so that if someone is down nearly need to trust something you have the confidence that you could throw it and this law of gravity will work on that object and ensure that it doesn't go up but it will go down because you have an understanding based on the knowledge that if you let something go it will fall that is knowledge understanding and wisdom working together come to church amen and then suddenly we're all like getting get understanding so there are a lot of people who come to church and they have knowledge in those scriptures but they have no understanding and they have no wisdom of how to apply the word in the daily lives and that's what our questions just want him to understand all to apply it but if the beginning is knowledge then the scripture goes deeper and says the beginning of knowledge is the fear of the Lord the beginning of knowledge is not algebra and geometry and geography and how to tie your shoelaces and how to say good morning the beginning of knowledge is the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord is what makes you come to church the fear of the Lord is what makes you reverent the fear of the Lord is what lets you know that the consequences of action of sinful action will be dead that's the fear of the Lord and we Cheryl young people yesterday that when you go into a courtroom you have to dress a certain way you have to address the judge a certain way because there's a fear of the judge in his courtroom it's fear a control that behavior and as we mature as Christian God wants a relationship to evolve from fear to one of love because God doesn't want you here this morning because you saw afraid Lord I hear no well you see I become frightened that's not the desired relationship he wants you here because of love so it's a spectrum the beginning of knowledge is fear the fear of the Lord not just fear but the fear of Lord is the beginning of knowledge later on and I think problems 90 said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom won't you so the foundation of your walk is the fear of the Lord the fear the Lord is what makes you reverence your parents honor your mother and father it's the fear of the Lord that TV that's in your soul it's because you fear the Lord you want to worship come on now it's a fear the Lord that brought you to church this morning it's the fear of the Lord that drives you to his word it's a fear the Lord that makes you want to forgive it's a fear the Lord that drives you to drop your arts it's the fear of the Lord that makes you want love your name I love your brother because you know God is watching you know he is all-powerful you know when you apply yourself it's a fear of the Lord that keeps you when you're in your workplace when you're in your school when you're driving on the road you know there's something greater than yourself of course that's awesome my god that's powerful the corner opened the Red Sea he's not God to be played with he's not God to be trifled with he's an oh come on somebody help me this morning we share with young people people fear the police they be there they feared judges and a Fiat gangsters and they don't want to fear the Lord because the perception is you can't see this gold but you can see the police you can see the gangsters but this God is a core of the invisible and he's an all-powerful God and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of understanding the beginning of knowledge the beginning of wisdom so let this man I was in Christ being you God want you to have godly knowledge godly understanding and godly wisdom wisdom to know how to act when tat wisdom to put your knowledge of what you have heard all these years in the message into your practical living what good is it to come to church and go back home and not know how to apply it he said if any man lack wisdom let him ask for it can the church say man everybody feeling fine this morning so called in His grace and His mercy and in his wisdom and in his knowledge because it's by foreknowledge he's able to produce tonight there is no extension of his knowledge God already knows everything and listen to this this quest for wisdom we share with young people yesterday but the Brenham said that Eve was looking for three things in the message I want to read it here in a message the spoken word is the original seed but I've answered and Jesus coming was that seat he proved it everything that Adam lost Jesus was see he is the correct even listen would have finally brought that child forth but she hybrid it brought a soupçon in listening for wisdom understanding knowledge so these three things we are speaking about because what did the serpent tell you if you take of this fruit you'll be wise so it means Eve and Adam in the garden were being presented with a higher level of wisdom by the serpent and when you go through the scripture you see God having this war between the knowledge of man and his knowledge the understanding of man and his understanding and the wisdom of man and his own wisdom is when I read a quote and we've touched on a few things in the message Seaton's eaten by the basket God needs no interpreter he does his own interpreting he doesn't need anyone else to tell him how to do it he is sovereign he said how he would do it and that's the way we he must keep his word when he said these signs shall follow them that believe he meant just that whatever he said was he pleased he said it would happen in these last days that he would do certain things and he done it he has to ask nobody whether it's time or not he knows what time is and what the plan is kind of church say ma'am you believe that this morning now Satan this deceiver I spoke up in Matthew 24:24 with some urgency now we find that by His gospel programs of knowledge better education higher ethics civilization and so forth has bewitched the people at once to serve God into believing his life even did not want to do that but he showed her how it was more wisdom in it she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand that's the prophets words now I'm caught hold her not to try to understand how can I understand any of these things I want you to understand that this issue of knowledge knowledge increases that's it we live they will knowledge increase people know so much that they don't want to know about God anymore they know how to take this medication I try this medication knowledge has increased till they can explain away everything and try to explain even God but God has his knowledge as greater than that and his understanding is greater than that and his wisdom that all together forms a mind of Christ the mind of God the thoughts of God to drop down in a people so that he will only do his will and they will take no thought of what they will see because they'll be thinking his thoughts come to a man and there many course I'm gonna skip them but but a man said if you really want if you really read the Bible with spiritual understanding so there's spiritual understanding not just natural understanding but spiritual understanding get in love with the writer then you can read between the lines and see where God pulls it out so God wants us to have spiritual knowledge spiritual understanding spiritual wisdom now wisdom is doing the greatest goal in any situation and the best way to achieve it wisdom is different from knowledge you can have knowledge without wisdom there are lot of brilliant fools but you cannot have wisdom without knowledge because in order to discern the best way to achieve something you have to be able to integrate to fuse together all kinds of factors from various sources of knowledge and experience David and Sam's 147 5 said his understanding is infinite so there's no limit to his understanding jeremiah was praising to the great and mighty god whose name is the lord of hosts the one grid in council and mighty indeed whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men in order to give to each person according to his ways and the result of his deeds when daniel described god's wisdom he wrote he changes the times and seasons he removes kings and establishes kings he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge that those who have understanding he reveals the deep and he had hidden things he's knows is in the tactics and the light dwells with him and that's the mind that God wants inside of us so to God there's no mystery there's no puzzle to God God is never surprised because he has all knowledge he has all understanding he has all wisdom so what you are going through this morning is no surprise to God he knows what you're going through he understand what you're going through and he's wise enough to have you go through your trial to go to your task to develop the character they develop the life of God in you Oh hallelujah somebody say man we have in Sunday's hulis morning when Paul tries to speak up the wisdom of God he moves into praises all the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways for who has known the mind of the Lord or who has ever has been his counselor or who has ever first given to him and has to be repaid for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever that's from Romans 11 I want to read that one more time can I do so Paul says all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom he said but greater riches of course wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways for who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has ever first given to him and has been has to be repaired for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever in other words the Apostle Paul is seeing God's wisdom is so deep that his judgments are unsearchable in other words I can't get to tear from here God's wisdom is sudeep's his ways are untraceable I can't follow all of what he's doing without being hopelessly over my head it is so deep that there's nobody who could give him advice because there's no advisor could advise him because his knowledge is so great understanding is so deepest wisdom is so profound he doesn't need to talk to your neighbor or your father or the pastor or anybody to bless you he could do what he wants to do Oh kinda church came in this morning can you trust the God who has all that knowledge can you trust a God who is all an understanding can you trust the God was all that wisdom so what are you complaining about what are you crying about what trial are you going through that court doesn't know about that court doesn't understand that court in its wisdom has sent you're way too perfect you can the church cement somebody give God a soda praise the wisdom of God is so deep and so expansive that he cannot even increase his wisdom I'll seal it again his wisdom is so deep and so expansive he cannot even increase his wisdom the only way God can increases wisdom if there was such a thing is if something as a comment of course a mind that hasn't thought about already but that's impossible so Yui can wine me why this why that causes already thought about intelligent seamen so cause actions are always perfectly wise there's no upgrading of his wisdom and the church seaman so he knows exactly where you are this morning he knows where your son is he knows where your daughter is he knows what's going on and all things will work together for good to them that love God answered my be called according to his purpose [Applause] [Music] [Applause] seaman Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory everybody feelin fine so we are building just something the internal eternal thoughts of God the difference between the way we think and the way that God things for us to change our prayer life we have to think differently about our prayer life for us to change the way we study we have to think differently about the importance of study God has to shock us and reboot us to think like him because even Jesus had to pray so there's no way of passing or bypassing him there's no way out of it Josh I was taught some merit it on the word day and night to have good success there's no bypassing that core it is knowledge already put that there for us and you know it but do you really understand it and we really apply it because if every day you're not praying and studying then you are still in the state of knowledge and it hasn't dropped into understanding because if you really understand that the devil has his eyes shift you like wheat but God has prayed for you and that he didn't have to do it but he did left a realm of glory to come to us you know this but when you understand it it makes you so grateful that you can't help but a worshiper you can't help but shout you know this but when you really understand that His grace is sufficient how can you be sad how can you be depressed how can you be frustrated that man who came to the prophet and the Prophet prayed for him he was a blind man and he came to the line they probably paid him and he went back and he didn't receive his sight he came back to the Prophet to probably see he already healed he nor the Prophet said it but he didn't really understand it he said go and sell a newspaper and say extra extra read all about it by stripes I'm healed something was waited a truck from knowledge understanding become way when it becomes an understanding to you nobody could cut could convince you otherwise do you understand that his blood he had already here you caught is not no healing he's not now calling he's not now Crete estimating it's already done you can hear it with head knowledge but when you really understand it brother it changes your walk up it changes your talk it changes your life it changes your expectation hallelujah my mind in the exposition the seven churches we read this quote before the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you other thoughts of God eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning not is he taking counsel even with himself we read that before so Court is it even second-guessing himself I wonder why I do that we do that I wonder where I put you think I wonder why I did it that's why I remember why I will put that there that's you taking conser with yourself but God does not take counsel with himself or anybody else can the church say man no is he at anytime adding to his knowledge so there's nothing you have ever done or whatever - that is new knowledge to court because he's can eternity to Eternity and his foreknowledge which is all knowledge saw you and found you in Mara Valentino Matalin suddenly blended you saw your grandfather your great-grandfather we saw the whole genealogy and he waited patiently so when you were being born for the Spirit of God to drop up up that put place because it was a scene that he pleased in there by his foreknowledge he predestinated you when your mama was carrying you she didn't even know what she was carrying but he knew what [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated the problem is most of us are suing a natural that we don't understand the eternal things of God when John was right in the book of Revelation he said he even looked and he turned to the angel who was revealing all these things to him can the church say man in revelation 22 and he said I was about to bow at the feet of this angel with a showed me to sing John was so awed by the ministry of this angel that he made a mistake and he wanted to worship this angel because he told his angel had to be the Covenant he enjoyed he told it in turn had to be the user of the Lord because he couldn't understand which other angel could reveal such great mysteries and when he started about this angel this is wrong 1895 he was there speaking the charge when John was here and this intercept don't power down because I am of the service of the prophets worship God and this angel ik cousins this angel appeared who was not from time but from eternity went back to where he came from within and trucktown again because through a prophet message we are made to know that that angel is the same angel of Malachi 4 5 and 6 how do you explain it was when a Branham sneaking the John how do you explain was brother branham speaking of sister hottie right how do you explain it's the words of a prophet to reach you in 2018 a star in the right hand of God to bring spiritual knowledge to bring spiritual understanding to bring spiritual wisdom to Tim who are called by his name somebody tweets back to me somebody say man somebody see hallelujah for the knowledge of God put all the pieces you could miss this when you fell in sin God allowed it to happen we need to recognize that you are mortal and you were born in sin but when he dropped his blood upon you it was meat also understand that is a mercy seat and his blood on the mercy seat Oh somebody help me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so what are you complaining about what are you complaining about Paul said I find a law when I do good evil is present all of these men were discovering something all of these men caught he hated certain things from them because he knows what you could see and what you cannot see he knows what you're supposed to see and what you're not supposed to see he knows why that man was sick for 38 years I'm just going to the Pool of Bethesda he knows he saw every time because then for knowledge and the encompassing knowledge of God means he knows every movement there's no computer in the world like a trap everything the way God and he was that man in the air one in here too and he already knew in the f38 that Jesus would be there and it'll be a sign and chorus just watching all the pieces move together listen corazon adjusting and readjusting he is just watching because he already thought about it he already understands it his wisdom supported understanding or somebody helped me this morning [Applause] and that's why Satan is mad and that's why we didn't know the Prophet spoke about the Seventh Seal he said was sad because you don't want to see anything you have to keep it because if the devil found out what it was he would do great damage so God had to hold the secret not from you but the secret from the devil because you know you could even trust yourself with some secrets so going up to wait till you mature enough to handle his kind of secrets I meant to confuse everything he said the secret is the word is in the pride quat disguise his spirit his dynamics in seed form and slipped it inside your soul when you won't even look him [Applause] and the chats amen you are going to a job you in the maxi and Cortez dropping secrets to you and how do you know because when you come to church no matter what you go through and you hear the word there's a connection listen you can receive anything from God unless you speak in his language so when the word goes forth even though you may be covered in fields covered in sin covered in depression there's seed in your so seen that's me but that's me that's me I'm gonna be healed I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna have a victory I'm gonna be adopted I'm gonna be perfected because your name is not but it bounces an almond never is another literal name but if the words in the book so when the word is reached and words perfection you may not have a full understanding of it but you know the word you know there's something connected there you see I think you're talking about Mira there's something in me crying out for perfection crying out for adoption called creation groaning travail and wait him a summit to happen [Applause] [Music] you may be seated that's why the Prophet said when the bride gets to know who she is then thereafter will go oh my somebody feeling fine this morning he enjoying a Sunday school this morning [Applause] [Music] hallelujah may God inspire your soul today to get spiritual knowledge study to show yourself approved to know what God rut ground you're standing on and you'll find friends the more you spend in the wood and in prayer and in fast in and in supplication and having a prayer life a lot of what bothers you will not bother you anymore it'll take you to a higher place half of your stress IRC on people yesterday if I were to order it ordered how many of them read their Bibles on three everybody last week I didn't want to put them on this bus so I'll give him a week brother kindly before they retake that example because when you read a Bible every day and you pray every day you will grow when you read a prophets message every day you will grow it's impossible future go backward if you are reading the word and you're praying every day I've said many that is impossible if you get in an argument with your boss knowledge understanding and wisdom we share with young people people get how could a coconut Christian family they had road rage how could how could a person ever acted at me because my husband did this or because my wife did this zone the fear of the Lord and his world and the way he wants us to operate is what guys our behavior it doesn't depend on anybody else's behavior the word says do not foresee the assembling of yourselves together it is not to fear the pastor that brings you to church this fear of the Lord and the thing of it is brother Steven if none of people don't know because they had all these things before but do you really understand and has it become applied in your life as wisdom the Bible said be wise as a serpent and gentle as a dove children honor your parents honor thy father and mother if that's just knowledge and it's not an understanding you would never do it there people who know they're not supposed to eat fried foods there's nobody in here cut immediate don't know fried who's not good the people will notice that KFC is not good and then you see them in Lyon I told you tell me Casey not good I know I mean have them to little coca-cola not good don't drink something didn't know I mission one with another you know coke not good and he drinking coke because at the knowledge level they're people who suffer with high blood pressure they don't condone assault Kannamma nice although easy so let me sort alone and nobody is one pie just one pie is it's only knowledge level Sierra from shady places you know it is nothing you don't know because we're the band said your conscience speaks to you and tell if you don't do something but whatever you reject your voice of your conscience after a while but Abraham said you start to get you lose his sensitivity and it becomes easier and easier for you to do foolishness it's not that you don't know but when it become an understanding of husband love your wives will come on somebody please back to me because knowing as well anyway understanding it because the understanding no means as Christ loved the church understanding now mean description now comes into proper context and wisdom knows how to rightly divide it so you know what cross in submit submit submits a bit like a broken record because you have to deal with your wife come on scripture according to knowledge see throughout scripture knowledge understanding and wisdom when those ingredients are wrapped together perfectly that's how the mind of Christ somebody say Amen it was God's understanding and his knowledge and his wisdom Lord Moses to grow up in Egypt there's no mysterious to accident so as Christians as message Bible believing Christians we have to grow in didn't in the knowledge of God and the understanding of his will for our life and you wisdom to know what we are supposed to do in the word when the seven thunders uttered a voices that group who can't eat the world and handed their that handing it this application that's not knowledge that hand media is understanding into wisdom to know what to do what he wants done with the word and that's what we are contending for the faith that was once delivered to the scenes where they only said what he wanted said or they kept still you could have knowledge to let somebody but wisdom holds your tongue there are many ways to deal with situations if you deal with it with knowledge but you did this turn God he doesn't deal with us with knowledge only because he could say well you made this mistake oh you made that mistake but his understanding connected to wisdom pushes the knowledge of your sins under the blood as it is here for Catholics so when he sees us his understanding and wisdom sees through the blood because he be keeps bringing up knowledge of your mistakes we will never stand a chance somebody help me preach this morning you have to learn other TV you can't do the cheering with knowledge because we don't have God's ability to place it in the CEO forget it and leave it there we live with the knowledge of what people did to us but it takes understanding of how somebody else feels and the wisdom to know how to leave and let things go that is the mind of God and what distinguishes his thinking from our thinking Oh somebody help me preach this morning I've heard men and brother see you know this men and women anything differently you know Mac you forget something and then woman a little different by George it could be fifteen years later and I always a joke when I see ah I see it's like they have this black book you'd be like yeah and the last time you're hot put that in nothing it was in 1987 and I told you don't put it there no that's knowledge maybe not but understanding well maybe that would wisdom but you have to know how to treat the Bible says don't don't don't push it children because our I don't want it takes wisdom in this day more than ever because no it's not understanding and wisdom is legalism you know you do this you do but but you have to have with all that getting get understanding understand as a young man you have a testimony in your school in your job is that this not of all people message this is the everybody message when you understand and understanding is connected to love because when your love becomes unconditional for God and conditional for your brother for your sister it goes because you have to no forget certain things that's why Pope said do I know all things and I don't have charity you don't have love do I know all mysteries why I keep my baby people and have not charity he said with a higher thinking I'll be a renewal of mine a transformation of your behavior to be christ-like not church like but christ-like that is what we are here for to grow that our behavior change friends God isn't measuring us by what we profess he's measuring us by what we possess and the Perry says out of the abundance of your heart the mouth speaks so I know what's in your heart by what comes out of your mouth or somebody help me preach this morning and God puts us he said if any man lack wisdom you need wisdom to know how to be on your job wisdom I don't you deal with your journal to dealing with your neighbors because your neighbors are looking at you you have your knowledge you know any word I say it's done about yourself you're hidden you here on your hidden that's all knowledge no one is signing a wisdom how could you convince somebody this is the right way it buys the approach say Lord I want to testify to my neighbor and know the scriptures represent but me you give me an understanding of their situation and the wisdom and how to present it to them that they could even look beyond my faults and see the wood for what it is somebody helped me this morning that's why the backside here and what if the soul is wise it doesn't take knowledge to win souls or even understanding it takes wisdom to put it together to be able to understand what somebody's going through and show them that there's a better way and Paul gave us the best way say follow me as I follow Christ so he qualified even his own ministry to them the citizen I don't want it abyss your feet on my standing and by your own testimony my testimony is as good as I follow Christ but if I ever fall away from following Christ keep your eyes on him because he's the perfect example he made sure and give the right knowledge and his understanding of his humaneness and the wisdom of how God operates to you to put it and rightly divide the word clicking of a balance life and the church teaming with all night getting get understanding better walk a better talk a better we have life friends when this become a reality to you testifying and sharing the goodness of Jesus becomes natural because any course of them it goes beyond the knowledge of Jesus seems to the understand the will need salvation and understanding of your family needs this I know sure releases funny young people who are back season it's not knowledge just what they need it's an understanding and even though they fell His grace is self-sufficient there are people who know this but I don't understand it because when you talk to somebody who is struggling this struggle with can I come back and the Bible said the way of the transgressor is hard so it's not easy because it no better so God was really really really wants to change the life around but it's really understand that His grace is sufficient and his hand is not too short to reach at them and pull them back from the clutches of the devil and when God does that work of transformation for you it gives you an understanding to love even more than you ever loved before [Music] that's why when people judge others in church you know they haven't had a real experience with God because if you know what God took you and you understand how you have to reach the cat you it takes you down from that position of judgment to an understanding that people are impaired they could be in church but they're in need they can be coming out and smiling but they're in pain Jesus when he walk to safety that's how well have no need of a physician but I come to come to comfort them that born he can't deal with sick people how dare you sit in church on judge people we are bunch of sick people because that's who Jesus came for he came to heal the sick he came to restore the black slider he came to pick up the broken pieces you made me see them I'm tired of people who know two three chords no to three scriptures and don't have an understanding that this message is all about love and all about forgiveness and there's blood on the mercy seat the same blood for you is the same platform II [Music] [Applause] you may be seated that's why God has to make sure it's rightly divided have knowledge this could just couldn't seumas don't let the argument for course for these and you can check one another's hand what court is definite what's the scriptures therefore then huh nor knowledge have all knowledge it's just cool any prophet said it this way that's how it isn't I'm no understanding that if it wasn't for the grace of God you'd be dead in a hospital be somewhere drinking smoking you didn't deliver yourself you call yourself how do you judge somebody else you don't know my story I don't know your story but his love his grace his knowledge his understanding his wisdom reaches to the highest mountain goes to the lowest Valley it was cause knowledge of what the fall of man meant and it's understanding that there was no way back for us and its wisdom and it would take a kinsman redeemer to come and take a place for us that he left his throne of glory and came down to Calvary what right do we have to condemn one another when we ought to be praying for one another oh god help us this morning to see the knowledge understanding and wisdom of a great God you may be seated Sunday School this morning the Prophet said he went out to eat one time I believe it was eating he looks around you see a woman dressed a certain way look in a certain way he had the knowledge that that was wrong but he didn't understand her story and he started to condemn that woman and got dropped down in front of him and showed him his sins and a blood pumping it off and he got an understanding that he also was a sinner because very easy for us with a little bit of knowledge I got Aragon to get proud and when the Lord dealt with him he went to that woman and as he began to minister to her she said to him I was a Christian one time oh god help us but I lost my way knowledge was a new understanding human in the prophet when wisdom was able to minister to friends I must spending time preaching about the quotes or the scriptures now I'm talking about you having a knowledge and understanding and the wisdom of God as a personal experience because God has had coming for a church or a group he's dealing with individuals and that relationship is one of love what time the prophet went to a meeting and as he got there there was almost a colored church as he would describe it and he heard dancing and shouting and the Prophet was a little taken aback by the worship he said I don't have this in my church this is a little strange and the Lord kept him on his shoulder and said he was sitting in the seat it was gone for my balance it before he recognized he was dancing in the middle of them it was not by his choice by his volition but God took a rule of the Prophet to show him certain things and in our walk with God he has a desire because the pastor kind of reveal God to you it has to be God himself and that's what people have missed it people are lined up like soldiers and churches this is my church my adoption my pastor my teacher wherever you see koco's we a sovereign Church left-right-left straight away when god is love and he wanted a sylvan based on love we don't reach out enough we don't pray enough we don't cry out enough we don't testify enough we don't love enough we don't watch happy enough we don't give him praise enough we don't encourage one another amount may God give a spiritual understanding today [Applause] [Music] Peter and Paul both called both anointed both filled with the holy spirit both with the knowledge of what the tradition was for how the Jews lived but Peter did not have an understanding that the ministry had changed so Paul and Peter currency eye-to-eye because Peter has him at the Gentiles need to stop eating certain things and poor with an understanding see if the law of Christ are you with me this morning Peter who walked with Christ Paul did not walk with Christ but Paul was the angel of that age it was a lot for Peter to acknowledge that what Paul was saying was the truth and Paul who was not there with Jesus had the spirit quad given Authority and set the gold standard for the angels and the stars it would come the set Peter straight and give grace to the Gentiles to access this glory friends knowledge and wisdom and understanding you have to connect not to your own ability or your own study but you have to come to court situations in your marriage you go to Casa Lord show me how how in your job show me how don't just run into situations we have all the examples in scripture Joshua's day he wants to know how to approach Jericho I mean a captain of the host comes I'm Justin are you force are you against us you see what I'm I'm the captain I come to answer your prayers you want to know how I could be tell you how when you read the Psalms and I encourage you spend time at the sounds you hear David crying I'll order show me keep me hear my prayer O God give ear to my supplications and I faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified so David is playing his keys because you want gotta intervene on the situation we rushed too easily into situations we trust our own strength and that's why when the band said compassion is not feeling sorry for people compassion is when the will of God at that situation with the Pool of Bethesda there were many people lean world blind and Jesus bypassed all of them I say well why didn't Jesus heal everybody he's doing the will of God and he came to that man what becoming for 38 years and asked him will now be made it was some of us we start a prayer line so they prefer everybody and here's Jesus being led by God who it's an individual because you do know will of God have you asked God for the will of God for your life after my preach this morning as a Sunday school the will of God Lord what would you me to do lord help me to pray and help you to pray for what I need to pray for so you ready a screen for what you want to pray for what you think is a Lord guide me even in my prayer life help me to pray for what I need to pray for may God help I'm not gonna be too much longer with you this morning this is just part one Lena foundation on knowledge understanding and wisdom so that we could be better Christians and live a real Christian life piece on the scriptures and a message of Malachi for somebody same the Apostles took no thought of what they were thinking because they no longer needed to think they were speaking for God who needed a mouthpiece they were thinking his snorts can the church and many times when you read scripture we see it is difference between God's thoughts and our thoughts and that's why we're trying to close the gap this morning from the word between the way we think and the way God thinks I'm the same and when God spoke to kitty say Keenan a mighty man of Valor that was God thoughts look around he said my tribe is the smallest tribe my family is the smallest family and if it didn't no army smallest one in my tribe and you calling me a mighty man of Valor his thinking was little I remember God thinking and sending him and I never would have you think that you were defeated you were frustrated you can't make it it makes no sense fighting and make no sense trying and

was thrown out of Egypt but the Branum said he spends 40 years in the wilderness fame to unlearn Oh help me him to unlearn what he had learned God had 40 years in the wilderness for him to forget his knowledge and get a heavenly knowledge God took 40 years up to take on his human understanding because his human knowledge and his human underst he could have killed one man but when he got God's knowledge I'm God understanding and God's wisdom he can walk down the Pharaoh I said Pharaoh let my people go that's why the bus it will not be money not made my might nor by power but by the spirit said the Lord understand God is a spirit and I swear at me he drops down his thoughts his thinking's on the matter every matter in your life good as a thought about it every situation God has a

he knows all things so there's nothing he doesn't know he knows what's going on with your wife with your child with your boss with your dog with the fly outside your house he knows all things there's nothing he does not know as if that's not enough to make a great decision he understands all things he understands not only where your daughter is but what she is going through right now he also understand the pain you feel about where your daughter is right now because he knows all things and he understands all things and because of his knowledge because of his understanding he has perfect wisdom about when to intervene how to intervene what will happen when he intervenes Oh God Almighty help us this opponent is anything too hard for the Lord is anything too hard for the Lord this morning at the appointed time I will return to you and you'll see your house delivered you'll see your family delivered you will see your situation deliver [Applause] you may be seated may God give us the knowledge that he has the knowledge may God give us the understanding that he understands and may God give us the wisdom that he has the wisdom to deal with every situation no one other prophet could see I take every spirit under my control because when there's perfect knowledge perfect understanding and pappad wisdom nothing is out of place full authority and God promised that this endtime bride will be thinking his thoughts she will be doing what he wants done knows what he wants done with the wood the wood is our weapon the wood is our defense the wood is our offense the word is powerful shop sharper than a two-edged sword the wood can cut out the spirit of fornication this morning the spirit of adultery spirit of drinking lion lost pornography the Word of God is able to cut it out today break every chain when the devil met Jesus he didn't even need to use her spirit to deal with the devil he just use the word he rightly applied the word it is written it is written it is also written you may be seated [Applause] [Music] because give us a knowledge that to be carnally minded is death give us an understanding of what it means and when we go in our own flesh and our own devices on our own inspiration that we are coming contrary to the will of God but a Braille appears an entire message doing call a service without it being his will many times the actions are the activities we do that we think pleases God God caused an abomination because it's not his will ministers reaching out of his will people acting out of this will Lord we want your will to reign in this house as for me and my house we will serve the Lord bring black to pray altar bring black the family altar may we get the knowledge the understanding and the wisdom how to bring our families together that the men of God will be priests in their homes once again perfect order perfect harmony back to the Bible back to the principles leave town on the day of Pentecost that's what we are contending for Ernest Lee contending for defeat you may be seated are you happier here this morning could you take some more when the alpha church fell where the Williams falling away means you begin to lose certain things so the Alpha church fell and with the fall they forgot things so they lost knowledge they forgot understanding understanding is deep because it really takes knowledge and puts knowledge into perspective it fell so much that God has to go to the Catholic Church to find a man woman who stumbled upon knowledge in the form of the scriptures and read the JA shall live by faith I'm gonna to minister to his knowledge to give him a revelation which is a deeper understanding of what the scripture meant and the conviction and the wisdom now what that till he's had to write something I kneel it on the church door and it was not to be kept secret and even though that have his own private revelation or private ambition but it was for a purpose the wisdom with how to deal with the situation and that started a great Reformation this gospel we preach this morning is dripping with blood a lot of sacrifice when true for us to be here this morning we could claim no credit for this message because it's not our message is his message and a lot of blood including his blood was shed for us to be here and we have become casual and lazy and lean back and taking things for granted and God will not bless that we support young people asleep but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge the beginning of wisdom and the Bible says the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him so there is no protection for those that don't fear him when you break the word and you go on your and proposal lean not on your own understanding so when we talk about knowledge understanding and wisdom will speak about your knowledge and your understanding and your wisdom because that will feel rich over connecting to his knowledge his understanding and his wisdom come to church say man is it becoming real to anybody at the end of this journey of coming to church on Sundays and Wednesdays and Fridays and youth services is that we ought to be christ-like that just like inna we could be walking and in one day our feet would hit the Kings Highway but the banner said one of these days the last someone will be preached the last song will be sung the Bible be read for the last time and a great sifting or a marking of the exam people's will come and that marking of the exam papers is not about doctrine or knowledge but is if you went all the way to apply the word to apply the blood on your house most of the issues we fuss about and spend time stressing about our temporal issues that have no bearing on the kingdom or the things of the kingdom and the devil does a great job of affecting our lives and we do very little to push back because the devil has no power he was stripped of his power when Jesus went and took the keys of hell so the devil has people chopped and they could walk on anytime because he can't even lock them because he has no keys we see that again there we were trapped in their minds but he has no keys to keep you trapped that's why the Prophet said that your healing is based on your feet salvation is based on your feet it has nothing to do with what your grandfather did or your father did or what your past was because he said prostitutes walked into the meetings her toe would get a hole of feet and they exited the devil's hotel because the devil couldn't hold them because I'd ever know how deep the devil have no security so you can walk out anytime from the devil's it's not a present because you have no keys the devil's hotel you can just get up right now and you could walk out he can stop you he could try to look like he have power but I'm telling you he have more power so you can walk out right now that's sickness in your body you could walk out right now the Prophet stood and there were people who didn't even come to the prayer and there was a lady one time but it tells you know it she walked up to the Prophet with her crutches look at the Prophet shrugged her crutches and walked back out because you recognize that a lot of Moses still lived the God of Abraham still lived [Applause] [Music] so your deliverance it is based on the merit of your feet if dog can't believe your family is delivered already your healing is already complete your family is delivered you just have to receive it you can walk in it and you can worship reckless worship because it ever can hold no more you can throw down the fork you can turn on the wheelbarrow you can throw down the hammer you can draw down all these sub the taskmaster had little choice on this morning and we're gonna head to the promised land I didn't say goodbye Egypt goodbye world i spare no longer with you cut by pleasures of sin i stand longer with you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] could you take some more that's what we came to church for this morning right the devil doesn't like this you know proverbs 1 and verse 20 wisdom cried without so wisdom is being defined here as a person and crying outside she uttered her voice in the streets so wisdom is looking to help and his soul interested in helping wisdom is crying out to anyone who would listen she cry it in the chief police of concourse crying where everybody is walking in the openings of the kids in the city she uh Teresa would sing how long he's simple ones will he love simplicity and thus corners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge tourney as my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make normal I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but he have said I've not all my counsel and with none of my reproof listen to the consequence when wisdom is crying out I'm sorry just record once to give me the Holy Ghost warning even one to receive it and wisdom from the word is crying out for us to change our walk faster be more sincere and our failure to act on this cry from wisdom listen to the words because I have call and he have refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regard it but he have set up not all my counsel and with none of my reproof I also will laugh at your calamity I will mock when your fear commits when your fear cometh desolation and your destruction coming as a whirlwind when distress and anguish commit upon you then shall they call upon me and I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that the hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord I want to remind the church this morning the fear of the Lord is a choice it is not an automatic behavior the fear of the Lord is what is what keeps a young woman modest the fear of the Lord is what keeps you faithful to your wife both fear and love the fear of the Lord and a love for his word and a love for your wife but he said they have not chosen the fear of the Lord instead they have chosen the fear of man because if the fear of the Lord should make you act a certain way when you don't act that way it means there's something else influencing you and there are people here who fear their neighbors thoughts about them more than the fear of the Lord they fear what their school friends will see more than they fear the Lord they fear how their boss thinks about them more than they fear the Lord they fear what their family members think about them more than they fear the Lord maybe search our hearts today because if you truly fear the Lord he will honor him you are respective you will reverence him the fear of the Lord will make wives submit to their husbands the fear of the Lord will make husbands love their wives the fear of the Lord will make sure an OPD appearance the fear of the Lord will bring you here silly to the house of God because you want to hear his voice made us sing into your soul today the fear of the Lord will make you turn from evil and away from wicked and stay away from shitty places the fear of the Lord will make you aware that he's watching every move that you make the fear of the Lord will make you wake up in the morning and go to your knees and prayer and say Lord early will I seek me I look to the hills from whence cometh my help the fear of the Lord is about his majesty is about his glory is about his omnipotence his omniscience his deity is presence his August being the fact that the four twenty elders at the same and that's a fail the Lord he is God mighty in battle the Egyptians fear him the Romans fear Him the Greeks fear him armies were scattered before him and this God has said there shall be no other God before me may this resonate in your soul this morning sunday-school message [Music] big or open your understanding this morning I'm getting ready to close out the disciples over Jesus for three and a half years they grew up with knowledge they grew up knowing the Scriptures in so much and even spending time with Jesus their knowledge would have increased because Jesus was ministering to them and sharing things with them but in Jesus resurrection ministry they barely opened their understanding to the scriptures that they had knowledge of before which meant even while they were with Jesus the understanding had not yet been opened they have knowledge of it described and the Pharisees and Sadducees they had knowledge without understanding because had they had understanding when Jesus stood and read the Spirit of the Lord is upon me they thought he was reading from but when he said this didn't scriptures will fill that was not knowledge that was an understanding that before their very eyes this treaty was being fulfilled or somebody pitched back to me everyone knew the scripture of the voice crying in the wilderness but when John was in the earth nobody understood that that scripture was in front of the eyes Mary grew up living her life as normal with knowledge that a virgin will conceive it took an angel Gabriel to come to her and say he'll married our highly favored and he brought an understanding to the knowledge that she had that she was the one chosen to bring for the Christ and many people come to church come to the message with knowledge of scriptures knowledge of course without an understanding of your place in Christ an understanding of the expectation not just of where you ought to go but the behavior and the character that's required to go there be knowledge alone it's not going to take it takes you perfect love to catch you there and it takes an understanding and perfect love is the full wisdom of God charity itself to drop down to guide you through your journey that you don't make the wrong steps musician cigarette to come this morning we have back to the Bible back to the scripture may God give you knowledge this morning that you're gonna make it may give you an understanding that no devil is gonna stop you and me give you wisdom that every time you worship and you praise God it brings you closer to him doing more for you when Canada was praying the angel was fighting he understood the effects of his prayers it was not just knowledge for him but it was a reality to him may it be a present tense reality to you to affect your walk to affect your talk me push you to make an effort to be here in Wednesday night service an effort to be here in Friday night service an effort to come Church early the prayer of the service not just knowledge but an understanding that your prayers couldn't affect the heavenlies your prayers could change the situations in your home in your life and when you wanna pray it up anointed that will have to cross the street he can't commit angels of the Lord in camp around you when your prayer life is different than your worship is different and it comes on the belly of the soul with a revelation that God called you for a purpose can the church say man Oh [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you can we gonna play something softly [Music] every scripture is going to be fulfilled we know this we know this but one day we are promised we will understand but the banham told us rapturing feet is

God go into action because the promise is on to you and to your children he already made a promise he cannot take back the promise we have the knowledge may God give us understanding that it has got to come to pass and wisdom to live our lives without fear without worry without being concerned knowing all things are possible to tempt that belief and the church say men fear not little flock it is
