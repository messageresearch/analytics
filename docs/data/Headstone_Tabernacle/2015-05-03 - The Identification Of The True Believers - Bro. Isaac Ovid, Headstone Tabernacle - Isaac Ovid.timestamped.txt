[18:08] would not get you the right results I'll
[18:09] say it that way the wrong attitude will

[18:22] course you're just a little nervous kind
[18:24] of upset like I want to get you in the
[18:27] right attitude of God mentally speaking
[18:30] towards god promise before I pray for

[18:36] to have a certain attitude listen to
[18:39] this one next one I watch him on the
[18:42] platform sometime in a healing service I
[18:44] watch the attitude they come in the
[18:47] other night remember the lady come with
[18:50] enough why didn't have enough Faith har
[18:52] to get to the platform she'd been in
[18:54] prayer line after prayer line I know the
[18:56] woman wasn't going to get well I seen
[18:58] her coming up here I knew it wasn't she
[19:00] didn't have the right attitude when she
[19:03] come up to get well she can't do it I
[19:07] said Lord Jesus bless your sister go may
[19:09] he heal you that's all I could say but
[19:11] it's not here she she's been here and
[19:14] there and everywhere but you got to take
[19:16] God at his word oh Hallelujah so he
[19:19] could see people attitude he could see
[19:22] how they come into church he could see
[19:23] it so making appearance is not good
[19:26] enough
[19:27] amen amen
[19:30] think brother Anthony struck that last
[19:31] Sunday making appearance a church member
[19:33] they appear in church pop that's not
[19:35] good enough now that you are here what
[19:38] next I'm not hearing you now that you
[19:40] are here what next because the woman she
[19:43] made her appearance and said Lord my
[19:45] daughter is vexed with the devil that's
[19:46] good he said he didn't answer a word
[19:48] disciples said send her away please
[19:50] because she harassing
[19:51] us she's crying after us then she come
[19:55] and worship Hallelujah she trying
[19:58] something
[19:59] she's worshiping amen Lord help me and
[20:03] Jesus response was it's not fit to take
[20:05] the Chan's bread and cast it to dogs am
[20:08] now if that woman didn't have a real
[20:09] substance didn't have something real she
[20:11] take off after that and make a whole big
[20:13] RAB tell the neighbors get newspapers
[20:16] Twitter it tweet it Whatever It Is put
[20:18] it on Facebook she name it she was going
[20:20] to have a lot of problem but that woman
[20:21] stood at Ground she stood right there

[20:26] say it to I'm not moving say I'm not
[20:28] tell somebody I'm not moving tell them
[20:29] I'm not moving oh praise God she stood
[20:32] her grounds her Grounds was the word she
[20:34] knew that that man standing there was
[20:36] the right man she knew he had the power
[20:38] to do what she wanted done she know her
[20:40] daughter was vexed with a devil her
[20:42] daughter didn't have a two dick the
[20:43] dentist could see about that the doctor
[20:45] didn't have a headache Panadol and cfol
[20:47] or whatever that could take care of that
[20:49] but this daughter was vexed with the
[20:50] devil that's Spirit business that that
[20:52] needs more than than some medical
[20:54] discernment that that need more that
[20:56] needs something more you see when the
[20:58] devil start a ride it needs power it
[21:00] needs virtue it needs something more
[21:02] than you prepar to deal with praise God
[21:05] and when that comes on the seam you may
[21:07] as well have the right attitude because
[21:08] the right attitude will produce the
[21:10] right result and we want the right
[21:13] result this morning God expect results
[21:16] God expect to be de ding with his people

[21:27] of wickedness healing the sick raising
[21:29] the dead causing a Revival God expects
[21:31] something from his people not sitting on

[47:04] identification of the True Believers
[47:08] amen and my subject separating the word
[47:12] bride from the church
[47:15] members and my inspiration only the
[47:19] elect have the
[47:21] ability to hear from God Amen and before
[47:25] I get to my text this morning we are
[47:27] here this morning to hear
[47:29] truth we are not here to play games we
[47:32] are not here to just gather we are here
[47:34] to hear the truth because only the truth
[47:37] will set you free the truth makes you
[47:42] free we're not here this morning to
[47:44] entertain we are not here this morning
[47:46] to make you feel nice or to to get you
[47:48] to feel so excited about your future but
[47:51] you are here to hear the whole truth
[47:53] because you need all of the truth to
[47:55] know where you are standing ending and
[47:57] as we draw nearer to the closing
[47:59] chapters of time and as we get nearer to
[48:01] the convention and we get nearer to
[48:02] judgment you have to know where you
[48:05] stand tonight amen you must know where
[48:08] you stand this morning and I believe the
[48:10] time has come for the True Believers to
[48:12] be identified Hallelujah a lot of people
[48:15] believe that they are True Believers and
[48:18] that is the problem a lot of people
[48:21] believe they are True Believers and that
[48:23] is not the case because brother brandham
[48:25] taught us in every Church are three
[48:27] kinds of
[48:28] Believers and brother Brandon in
[48:30] preaching three kinds of Believers he
[48:32] said he preached a message so that
[48:34] people could assess themselves to see
[48:36] where they
[48:37] stand
[48:39] am I'm not here to assess you but you
[48:42] have to assess Yourself by the word to
[48:44] see where you stand because only the
[48:46] True Believers going to make it only the
[48:49] True Believers are going to go into the
[48:50] Rapture only the True Believers are
[48:52] going to get the holy ghosten can the
[48:55] church say amen amen
[48:57] sometime ago when I was preaching the
[48:58] message rapturing condition a brother
[49:01] called me up after the service and said
[49:03] he had a problem with something I said
[49:05] because I made a statement not everybody
[49:08] in here is going to the
[49:09] Rapture and he was troubled by it but
[49:13] that's what brother brandham taught us I
[49:15] can't lie to you and make you feel nice
[49:17] and say if you come to church you're
[49:19] going to go to the Rapture the criteria
[49:21] is not coming to
[49:23] church going to the Rapture is not based
[49:26] on attendance going to the Raptor is not
[49:29] based on Whose Church you in going to
[49:31] the Raptor is not based on who your
[49:32] pastor is going to the Raptor is based
[49:34] on you living the
[49:37] word can the church say Amen so I want
[49:41] to get down to some brass TX this
[49:43] morning get down on the inside of the
[49:45] Machinery this morning so that when you
[49:48] leave this service you're going to know
[49:49] exactly where you standing you're going
[49:51] to know the truth and the truth will set
[49:53] you free so that if you are on the edge
[49:55] this morning you won't be on the edge no
[49:57] more I'm putting you on guard this
[49:59] morning because the word is coming
[50:01] harder and harder and harder can the
[50:04] church say Amen you may be seated I'm
[50:06] laying the
[50:07] background the Bible says and brother
[50:09] bham used this scripture when he
[50:11] preached a message three kinds of
[50:13] Believers he referred to John chapter 6
[50:16] and John chapter 6 starts off with Jesus
[50:19] looking around him and the people are
[50:21] hungry and he asks if anybody has
[50:24] anything and brov spoke about that a
[50:26] young boy comes up with Five Loaves and
[50:28] two fishes that's John 6 and Jesus
[50:30] blesses it and he breaks it and he feeds
[50:32] the people later in John 6 he starts to
[50:35] say well this food you're eating is I
[50:38] come for a different purpose I am the
[50:39] bread of
[50:41] life and a little lower down Jesus comes
[50:44] and begins to drill deeper he says
[50:46] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[50:49] blood you have no part you are not part
[50:52] of
[50:54] me amen
[50:57] amen huh John 6:6 it says and many
[51:02] therefore of his
[51:03] disciples when they had heard this said
[51:06] this is a
[51:08] high who can hear it and people like to
[51:12] come to church and hear nice say but
[51:15] this morning we come to do some hard say
[51:18] and not everybody could hear it but it's
[51:19] for a reason because as Jesus stood
[51:22] there he stood for a purpose because his
[51:24] church was too big
[51:30] and God wanted to separate the church
[51:33] members from the word
[51:36] bride oh you don't hear me this morning
[51:39] God was starting a separation in his
[51:41] church in Jesus church had 82
[51:44] people and when Jesus said these words
[51:48] 70 70 walked
[51:52] away but the brandom typed those who
[51:55] walked away as the unbelievers they in
[51:58] the church and he said the unbelievers
[52:00] are those who have problems when the
[52:02] word comes forth they can't accept
[52:05] [Music]
[52:07] everything so when you have a problem
[52:10] accepting the word of God you know where
[52:12] you standing this morning because the
[52:15] True Believer accepts every word and
[52:17] acts on every word even if you don't
[52:20] understand it because the revelation of
[52:22] what Jesus was speaking about was not
[52:24] made clear to them yet but the
[52:25] unbeliever say n that's too much for us
[52:27] we're going to walk
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:31] away we're going to drill down and T
[52:33] we're going to get deep friends this
[52:34] morning because you got to know exactly
[52:37] where you're standing if you cannot take
[52:39] the word by definition you are an
[52:45] unbeliever not some of the word but
[52:47] every
[52:48] [Applause]
[52:49] word 70 walked away and Jesus turned to
[52:53] his remaining 12 disciples
[52:56] and ask the question will you go
[52:59] also and brother Peter say where can we
[53:03] go because you alone have the words you
[53:06] alone have this message you alone have
[53:09] this gospel you alone have signs and
[53:12] wonders you alone are rightly dividing
[53:14] the scriptures you alone are bringing
[53:17] spiritual food in due season you alone
[53:20] are raising the dead you alone are
[53:22] Healing The Sick you alone could call my
[53:25] name I thought my name was Peter but I
[53:28] recognize I have a different
[53:30] name you don't hear me this
[53:33] morning you may be
[53:37] seated three kinds of Believers were
[53:39] standing there on that
[53:42] day the 70 who had a problem when the
[53:46] word came forth the 70 who don't want to
[53:50] obey the word the 70 who want to come to
[53:54] church when they want to come to church
[53:56] the 70 who don't want to read their
[53:58] Bible because brother Brandon brought
[54:00] out the unbelievers and those who were
[54:03] not taking all the
[54:05] word so they come to church when they
[54:07] want they read when they want they pray
[54:10] when they want they don't reverence
[54:12] their husband it could be anything that
[54:14] you don't
[54:16] obey no wonder brother Bram could say
[54:19] full obedience to the word will entitle
[54:21] you to the
[54:23] Token so there are people sitting down
[54:25] in Message Church around the world today
[54:28] and the one thing they're not doing
[54:31] qualifies him as an unbeliever because
[54:33] they're using their own reasoning and
[54:35] their own thoughts and their own
[54:36] assessment this is a hard thinging you
[54:38] want to get an easy sing it's all right
[54:40] do this dress this
[54:42] way if you left the world you can't be
[54:44] looking like the world if you left the
[54:46] world you can't be talking like the
[54:47] world if you left the world you can't be
[54:49] acting like the
[54:51] world we want to make the church
[54:53] uncomfortable this morning for the
[54:55] unbelievers
[54:56] [Applause]
[54:59] because there must be a separation of
[55:01] the word pride with the church members
[55:04] because the unbelievers can't go into
[55:06] the upper room the make Believers cannot
[55:08] go into the upper
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:12] room can the church say Amen so what are
[55:16] you saying with Isaac yeah this is not
[55:17] the kind of shout for Joy service a
[55:19] couple of weeks ago when brother
[55:21] preached a DAT I wait upon the Lord that
[55:23] was a fiery service he came behind it
[55:25] the next week and say every service it's
[55:26] got be fire fire fire fire is the word
[55:28] this morning is about the hard says
[55:31] about taking the word because the word
[55:32] comes to shape you to cut you to take on
[55:35] all the pieces that you may even realize
[55:38] is there until all that's left is the
[55:40] word
[55:41] image not your idea not your
[55:43] interpretation all that's left is the
[55:45] word image all that's left is Jesus
[55:48] Christ all that's left is a living faith
[55:50] living virtue living knowledge living
[55:53] outside of that but the brandom said
[55:54] you're wasting your time
[55:57] you may be
[56:01] seated it's one thing if you are living
[56:04] in
[56:05] Alaska or you living on a mountain and
[56:07] you have no transport and you can't make
[56:09] it to church and you decide to connect
[56:11] on the internet but anybody who has
[56:13] accessed to fellowship and doesn't come
[56:15] to church
[56:20] unbeliever I home listening to tapes
[56:23] reading books that's all right do that
[56:24] on your time but this year is God
[56:26] [Applause]
[56:30] name hide
[56:33] sins dressing one way for church and
[56:37] dressing another way for
[56:39] work hard
[56:42] SS but God will have a perfect Church
[56:45] acting nice with the neighbors but
[56:46] acting like a rascal in your house with
[56:48] your
[56:49] family H sing but it's the word there
[56:53] will be a separation of the word pride
[56:56] from the church
[56:59] members and God will force the issue
[57:02] because only the True Believers can take
[57:04] the word and stand the test and God will
[57:06] turn the heat up turn the heat up turn
[57:09] the heat up turn the heat up until all
[57:12] the all all that other stuff comes off
[57:14] of you can the church say Amen it's easy
[57:17] listen you may be seated if you want to
[57:19] go and just jump and Shout the
[57:20] Pentecostal church has
[57:24] that Hallelujah but this is the age of
[57:26] the
[57:27] Overcomer this is the age of the True
[57:29] Believer who can take the word wait till
[57:32] their seven Thunders utter their voices
[57:34] to that group who could take the word
[57:37] that's true believers and hand it there
[57:39] it'll slice and
[57:41] cut you may be
[57:44] seated don't shout manifestation until
[57:46] you can take the word and hand it there
[57:50] there will be no manifestation until you
[57:52] could take the word and hand it there
[57:54] until you could take correction until
[57:55] you could hear the word and say Lord
[57:57] that's me cut me I've been guilty I've
[57:59] been loow I've been doing nonsense but
[58:02] this morning I'm coming back to God I'm
[58:04] getting away from unbelief I'm
[58:06] separating
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:11] myself you are going to know the truth
[58:14] this morning and the truth is going to
[58:15] set you free that's what we came here
[58:18] you thought this was not you thought
[58:19] this was just another ordinary service
[58:21] but the truth is this is a different
[58:23] kind of service you thought you were
[58:25] going to come here and leave the same
[58:27] but the truth is you're either going to
[58:28] get closer to God or further away from
[58:31] God but something's going to happen this
[58:32] morning you thought things in your life
[58:35] uh would never change but the truth is
[58:37] the Holy Ghost is here to bring change
[58:39] uh to bring change in your life uh you
[58:42] thought you'd always be sick but the
[58:44] truth is this morning healing is here
[58:46] you
[58:49] talk hallelujah hallelujah you may be
[58:53] seated you thought you need that friend
[58:55] in the world but the truth is once you
[58:57] have God you don't need nothing else
[58:59] because the test will come to see where
[59:01] you stand this morning can the church
[59:03] say Amen friends I'm not from the world
[59:07] I come from God and I'm going back to
[59:09] God I'm not here to have church I am
[59:12] tired of having church I'm looking to go
[59:14] to the Rapture but only one group will
[59:17] make the Rapture and that's the True
[59:18] Believers no unbeliever will be there no
[59:21] make believer will be there only the
[59:23] True Believers will be there the hour
[59:26] now come that the True Believers the
[59:29] true worshippers could worship the
[59:31] father in spirit and in truth I'm not
[59:34] talking about your past I'm not talking
[59:36] about your mistakes Peter made mistakes
[59:39] but he made it to the upper room Peter
[59:41] was a True Believer can the church say
[59:43] amen and okay if you fall down the True
[59:46] Believers will be identified because
[59:49] they're going to get back up again can
[59:52] the church say
[59:53] Amen don't just look at me say amen the
[59:56] True Believers respond to the word I'm
[59:59] not speaking to how you feel I'm not
[1:00:01] speaking to what you did yesterday I'm
[1:00:03] speaking to the True Believer the word
[1:00:05] he inside of your soul the devil could
[1:00:08] watch you but he cannot touch you
[1:00:11] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:00:13] he that's in the world you are not the
[1:00:16] believer but the word seed in you that's
[1:00:18] the believer you couldn't miss this if
[1:00:21] you wanted to you had to be here because
[1:00:24] the True Believers will be identified in

[1:00:34] a shout of Praise uh I'm not talking

[1:00:38] True Believers uh we're going to get to
[1:00:40] the courot but brother Bram said God
[1:00:42] could only prove his word by Believers
[1:00:45] are there any believers in the house you
[1:00:48] believe with all your heart you believe
[1:00:50] with all your soul but the pram said if
[1:00:52] you really believe God will give you the
[1:00:55] Holy Ghost do we have any True Believers
[1:00:58] uh any real Believers this
[1:01:01] morning
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:14] H hallelujah hallu
[1:01:18] hallelujah huj
[1:01:21] hallelujah heart SS this
[1:01:23] morning God had to get the church and
[1:01:26] track and 70 walked away and there was
[1:01:30] still a devil yes in the
[1:01:35] church it takes a revelation to rightly
[1:01:39] divide the unbeliever Now understand
[1:01:41] this this unbeliever is not the world
[1:01:43] we're talking about you
[1:01:44] know this is people in the
[1:01:47] church in the church we not talking
[1:01:49] about Marshall Montano and Nicki Minaj
[1:01:52] and these demonic people
[1:01:56] amen we are talking about in the church
[1:01:58] in the
[1:01:59] message three kinds of
[1:02:02] Believers in the message people who
[1:02:05] still want to cut their hair still want
[1:02:06] to wear makeup still want to wear pants
[1:02:08] still want to listen to worldly
[1:02:11] music compromise on the word still put
[1:02:15] Sports over God still put friendship
[1:02:18] over God still put their life and money
[1:02:21] over
[1:02:23] God those are the unbeliever in the
[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:32] church in the church with no
[1:02:35] testimony that's why I said sometime
[1:02:37] over this week here that's why I said
[1:02:39] some some you can't testify to anybody
[1:02:40] go you don't even have a
[1:02:43] testimony how could you tell somebody
[1:02:45] about Jesus when you look like them talk
[1:02:46] like them act like them curse like them
[1:02:48] listen and you would tell them come to
[1:02:49] church they don't want to hear
[1:02:51] you you must do something different to
[1:02:54] have the ability to say you want to know
[1:02:56] why I am this way it's because Jesus
[1:02:59] touched
[1:03:00] me it's when you live a life you have
[1:03:04] the opportunity to say yeah I don't
[1:03:06] smoke I don't drink I don't do
[1:03:08] [Applause]
[1:03:13] it the unbelievers are the easy ones to
[1:03:17] spot but you see the make
[1:03:24] Believers Jesus said except you eat my
[1:03:27] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:03:30] part for me and Judah said hey
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:42] amen and Judas was a devil in the
[1:03:45] church make
[1:03:47] believer coming to every service paying
[1:03:51] his tithes the day before he get paidy
[1:03:56] can find a fault with his
[1:03:59] testimony always in church an hour
[1:04:01] before the
[1:04:04] service no argument with nobody no you
[1:04:08] can't put a finger on him but you know
[1:04:11] what brother Bram said the make believer
[1:04:14] is when they compromise on one
[1:04:16] word they sit in the church reasoning
[1:04:21] analyzing they believe they are
[1:04:23] untracked to where they're supposed to
[1:04:25] go
[1:04:26] but they miss just one
[1:04:30] word and brother brandom said the make
[1:04:33] Believers will show themselves because
[1:04:35] they cannot make it to the upper
[1:04:37] room but the brandom said it was just
[1:04:40] when the break was to take place Judas
[1:04:43] had to expose
[1:04:46] himself so we are preaching a message
[1:04:48] this morning to begin to expose the
[1:04:50] unbelievers and the make Believers
[1:04:52] because there must be a separation of
[1:04:55] the word bride from the church members
[1:04:58] amen come on somebody say
[1:05:04] Amen brother bam in the message the
[1:05:06] Queen of Sheba said now some people look
[1:05:09] at their
[1:05:10] symptoms my pastor prayed for me last
[1:05:13] night but my hands know better that has
[1:05:15] nothing to do with it if you are really
[1:05:18] a Believer you don't even look at that
[1:05:21] it's already settled forever God healed
[1:05:23] you what if Abraham would have looked
[1:05:25] that next month to see if Sarah was
[1:05:28] going to have the baby he never noticed
[1:05:31] that he just noticed what God Said and
[1:05:34] any True Believer looks to the promise
[1:05:37] not what the symptoms are around them
[1:05:39] they look at what God Said So I don't
[1:05:42] care this morning what your symptoms are
[1:05:45] your symptoms could be your children it
[1:05:47] could be your coworker it could be your
[1:05:50] boss it could be your sickness it could
[1:05:52] be anything don't look at the symptoms
[1:05:54] don't look at the problem look to what
[1:05:57] God said that's what differentiates the
[1:06:00] True Believers from the make believer
[1:06:02] and the unbeliever they only look to
[1:06:04] what God
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:07] said you may be
[1:06:11] seated in praying brother brandham said
[1:06:14] and we know Lord in the message who is
[1:06:16] this that thy church is not in the
[1:06:18] majority this morning the True Believers
[1:06:21] are in the minority but someday Lord you
[1:06:24] will take that Minority it to yourself
[1:06:27] is that's my prayer this morning that
[1:06:28] that Minority could be taken up this
[1:06:30] morning can the church say Amen in the
[1:06:33] message Mah the prophet brother bam said
[1:06:35] all true prophets all true Christians
[1:06:38] all True Believers stay with that word
[1:06:42] no matter what anybody says you stay
[1:06:44] right with the word they say the days of
[1:06:46] Miracles is passed don't you believe it
[1:06:49] for the Bible said he's the same
[1:06:51] yesterday he is the same today he is the
[1:06:53] same forever amen
[1:06:57] and this is this I mentioned it before
[1:06:59] improving his word but said notice it
[1:07:01] was by his Believers that he proves his
[1:07:04] word by he can only prove his word not
[1:07:08] by unbelievers it's only by the
[1:07:10] Believers that he can prove his word no
[1:07:13] matter how much of the rest of them
[1:07:15] claim to be oh I believe see if you do
[1:07:17] God will prove it see it's by True
[1:07:20] Believers that he proves his word not by
[1:07:22] those who say they believe but by those
[1:07:25] who who really believe it's by his
[1:07:27] believing children that he proves his
[1:07:30] word so God is looking for some True
[1:07:33] Believers this morning and he don't need
[1:07:35] much of them because one will put a
[1:07:37] th000 to flight two will put 10,000 to
[1:07:40] flight listen I'm not preaching to the
[1:07:42] church this morning I'm preaching to the
[1:07:44] True Believers you could have walked in
[1:07:46] this morning for the first time but if
[1:07:48] there's a true believing seed in your
[1:07:50] soul and you could take all this word
[1:07:53] then God could use you God could fill
[1:07:55] you God can change
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:02] you Hallelujah but Brandon went on
[1:08:06] speaking about Moses and Caleb and
[1:08:08] Joshua he said now he had Believers the
[1:08:10] old crop had died
[1:08:12] off the unbelievers who said we couldn't
[1:08:15] take it he let every one of them perish
[1:08:18] every one of them but the Believers in
[1:08:21] other words God allowed the unbelievers
[1:08:22] to die
[1:08:24] out because he couldn't use them God not
[1:08:27] using your unbelief
[1:08:30] in we couldn't take it he let every one
[1:08:33] of them perish why every one of them but
[1:08:35] the Believers who was left Moses had
[1:08:37] been taken to glory and the unbelievers
[1:08:40] had perished in the wilderness and there
[1:08:42] people they have already perished they
[1:08:44] in church you know but they already
[1:08:47] perished perished in the wilderness and
[1:08:50] this was their children who were going
[1:08:52] over they were the only two that crossed
[1:08:55] over and that was the Believers Joshua
[1:08:57] and Caleb they was the Believers they
[1:09:00] was the one who crossed over it's the
[1:09:02] only way God can do it is by his
[1:09:05] believing children you believe that his
[1:09:07] Believers was the one that do it and
[1:09:09] it's the only way that God could do it
[1:09:11] is to find some Believers so God is
[1:09:13] looking for somebody who could take all
[1:09:16] the word and believe all the word and
[1:09:18] can live all the word then he has
[1:09:20] somebody to work
[1:09:22] through are you getting it this morning
[1:09:25] I want to nail down a few things and
[1:09:26] then we're going to be out of here from
[1:09:28] The Message sman Church age listen
[1:09:30] carefully brother Bram said now those
[1:09:32] children of Israel left Egypt about 2
[1:09:35] million
[1:09:36] strong they all journeyed together all
[1:09:40] saw the same Miracles all partook of the
[1:09:43] same manner and water from the smitten
[1:09:46] rock all followed the same Cloud by day
[1:09:49] and the pillar of Fire by night but only
[1:09:52] two reach the promised land only two
[1:09:55] were true or real Believers that's the
[1:09:58] prophet everybody coming to church
[1:10:00] everybody in the prayer meeting
[1:10:02] everybody reading the books everybody
[1:10:04] listening to the tapes 2 million people
[1:10:07] walked out of the world and head to the
[1:10:09] promised land but only two were real
[1:10:12] Believers that is correct because the
[1:10:14] word tells us that the rest
[1:10:17] died because of
[1:10:19] unbelief and because unbelief could not
[1:10:22] enter
[1:10:23] in then sins that is so but brandom and
[1:10:27] only two entered then the rest were not
[1:10:30] true believers what made the difference
[1:10:33] two stay with the
[1:10:36] word two stayed with the word when the
[1:10:41] hearts of the T spies failed at kades
[1:10:43] Baria Joshua and Caleb did not stagger
[1:10:46] for they believed the word and said we
[1:10:48] are more unable to take the land they
[1:10:51] knew they could because God had said it
[1:10:54] I have given you the land and all those
[1:10:57] Israelites saw the power and the
[1:10:59] goodness and deliverance of God they did
[1:11:01] not enter into rest listen which is a
[1:11:05] type of the Holy
[1:11:07] Ghost so you can see right now that very
[1:11:12] few will ever believe all the way to
[1:11:16] receiving the spirit of
[1:11:20] God I'll say that again but the brandham
[1:11:24] is now just speak about believing he's
[1:11:27] talking about believing all the way to
[1:11:31] receiving the spirit of God and he typed
[1:11:35] it as the Holy Ghost so people have to
[1:11:37] believe all the way to receive the Holy
[1:11:41] Ghost and brother Bram said any man
[1:11:44] supposed able to say when you had an
[1:11:45] encounter with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:11:48] because brother Bram when he was
[1:11:49] speaking about Acts 19 he said it was
[1:11:52] literally translated as you after having
[1:11:55] believed did you get the Holy
[1:11:59] Ghost so you have to believe until
[1:12:02] something
[1:12:04] happens and Don't Stop Believing until
[1:12:07] something
[1:12:08] happens believe until something happens
[1:12:12] but the problem is a lot of people they
[1:12:14] don't want to
[1:12:16] wait they want to ask for it and when
[1:12:19] God says not yet because you don't have
[1:12:21] the character
[1:12:22] yet there are still some issues in life
[1:12:25] listen you could cry for the Holy Ghost
[1:12:28] all you want until you clean up the
[1:12:30] areas of your life that's messed up you
[1:12:32] have no Holy Ghost to get because full
[1:12:35] obedience to the word to the full word
[1:12:37] entitles you to the Holy Ghost so people
[1:12:40] all over us screaming Lord F me and God
[1:12:42] is saying you have the word why are you
[1:12:45] not in church on time why are you
[1:12:47] forsaking the assembling of yourselves
[1:12:49] together why are you not reading the
[1:12:52] Bible why are you not praying until
[1:12:54] something happens
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:12:56] then then then you going to get the Holy
[1:13:00] Ghost God is obligated if you stay with
[1:13:03] the word to give you the baptism of the
[1:13:06] Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost you may be seated God is no
[1:13:10] respector of persons he doesn't respect
[1:13:13] pastors Apostles he respects no
[1:13:16] person God only respects his
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:22] word I hope this service brings you to a
[1:13:25] rock solid Revelation that playing games
[1:13:27] is
[1:13:28] [Applause]
[1:13:30] over you know disobeying one word could
[1:13:33] stop you from getting the Holy
[1:13:36] Ghost you don't reverence your parents
[1:13:40] the Bible says honor your father and
[1:13:42] your mother that's a
[1:13:44] word so you're doing everything else and
[1:13:46] you're disrespecting your father
[1:13:48] disrespecting your mother no holy ghost
[1:13:50] coming in
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:53] that and the word that God gives you is
[1:13:56] word that you could live on because you
[1:13:59] have a
[1:14:00] choice you always have a choice God
[1:14:02] doesn't take that choice away from you
[1:14:05] on Wednesday in Deo Martin I spoke on
[1:14:07] the valley of decision from The Book of
[1:14:09] Joel multitudes In the Valley of
[1:14:11] decision yes life is about choices you
[1:14:15] have a choice who your friends are you
[1:14:17] have a choice who you associate with you
[1:14:19] have a choice of what you make important
[1:14:21] in your
[1:14:23] life and you must be prepared to accept
[1:14:26] the consequences of your
[1:14:29] choices you sitting dead or worshiping
[1:14:32] is a choice because worshiping is not
[1:14:34] based upon you worship is based upon God
[1:14:37] being who he
[1:14:39] is worship is not based on how your day
[1:14:41] was yesterday and what happened last
[1:14:43] week worship is because he is Alpha he
[1:14:46] is Omega he is beginning he is the Ender
[1:14:50] he is El Shi he is Jehovah he is
[1:14:53] Jehovah there is none like him I
[1:14:56] searched all over couldn't find nobody
[1:14:59] nobody like Jesus search high and low
[1:15:03] still can't find nobody I may not have
[1:15:06] money in my pocket but I searched all
[1:15:08] over and I couldn't find
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:13] nobody everybody in here have have a
[1:15:16] reason to give God a praise
[1:15:21] offering you have no excuse what shall
[1:15:24] separate us from the love of God forget
[1:15:27] your back pain forget your arthritis
[1:15:29] forget your diabetes what shall separate
[1:15:32] us we are True Believers this
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:47] morning I hope this settles in your
[1:15:50] soul I said in Deo Martin the battle is
[1:15:53] not a weak battle or a month battle it's
[1:15:55] a daily
[1:15:56] battle every single day you have to
[1:15:59] accept responsibility for your
[1:16:02] actions
[1:16:03] amen the real test and only the True
[1:16:06] Believers can take the real test the
[1:16:09] test is all about your
[1:16:12] response we shared this in De Martin but
[1:16:15] spoke about that woman who said my
[1:16:16] daughter is vexed with the devil God
[1:16:18] wasn't testing what church he went to it
[1:16:22] was her response and in the midst of her
[1:16:25] trial she said the right
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:36] thing job job's test wasn't about what
[1:16:42] he
[1:16:44] lost the discussion between God and
[1:16:47] Satan was what Satan's was is was was
[1:16:50] was what job's response was expected to
[1:16:53] be that's right right come
[1:16:57] on so all of the situations in job's
[1:17:00] life his children his property his
[1:17:03] animals it was not about the animals it
[1:17:05] was not about the children it was not
[1:17:06] about the property it was about his
[1:17:08] response because the wager was that if
[1:17:11] you oppress him he will have a negative
[1:17:14] response he will say the wrong thing he
[1:17:17] will curse
[1:17:19] God and even his wife said why don't you
[1:17:22] curse God and die she played into the
[1:17:24] devil's
[1:17:26] program but job looked at his situation
[1:17:29] he looked at his son he looked at his
[1:17:32] daughter he looked at what he lost and
[1:17:34] he said though the skin worms destroy my
[1:17:36] body I'm not going to say the wrong
[1:17:38] thing yet in my flesh I'm going to see
[1:17:41] God I might be able to put my hand all
[1:17:43] the way up but yet in my flesh there's a
[1:17:45] resurrection power that's got to come if
[1:17:49] I have the right attitude I could still
[1:17:51] say the right thing it could be bad but
[1:17:54] I could still have the right
[1:18:02] response is this reaching anybody this
[1:18:05] morning no matter what the situation is
[1:18:08] you could say the right
[1:18:09] thing you may be seated sister hatti
[1:18:13] Wright sitting with the prophet talking
[1:18:16] with the Prophet The Prophet is sharing
[1:18:17] an
[1:18:18] experience and she said that's nothing
[1:18:21] but the
[1:18:23] truth she didn't come to brother Bram
[1:18:25] and said brother brandham my sons are
[1:18:26] giving trouble no Jus said that's
[1:18:29] nothing but the truth and brother
[1:18:31] brandham said you said the right
[1:18:35] thing and for this saying what do you
[1:18:44] want let that settle down a little
[1:18:46] bit so only the True Believers will
[1:18:50] believe all the way to receiving the
[1:18:54] spirit of of God
[1:18:56] Amen and listen when Peter received the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost he didn't have to wonder if
[1:19:00] he got it you
[1:19:01] know come on that's why I always say
[1:19:06] when at Mount
[1:19:09] Transfiguration when the voice said this
[1:19:11] is my beloved Son and whom I'm well
[1:19:13] pleased hear him and you hear the hear
[1:19:16] him part you didn't have to wonder if
[1:19:18] Jesus was
[1:19:20] adopted it wasn't a discussion it wasn't
[1:19:22] a speculation his life manifested
[1:19:26] something and when God's power is moving
[1:19:29] in your life that's why brother BR said
[1:19:31] it will speak for itself yes because
[1:19:33] there's a voice that's speaking and that
[1:19:36] voice doesn't give an uncertain sound we
[1:19:38] shouldn't have to discuss if Jesus was
[1:19:41] adopted if this one was adopted if this
[1:19:43] one has that it should not be a
[1:19:44] discussion because it's supposed to
[1:19:46] speak for itself and when it speaks the
[1:19:48] evidence or the manifestation is 100%
[1:19:51] clear it doesn't need interpretation
[1:19:53] because God doesn't need an
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:19:59] interpreter we're saying some things
[1:20:01] this morning from the message spoken
[1:20:03] word is your original seed can you take
[1:20:05] some more the True Believers can take
[1:20:06] some
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:13] more from the spoken word is the
[1:20:15] original se but the B says now let us
[1:20:17] stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see
[1:20:20] the promised land coming in sight it's
[1:20:23] nearing the time to be given Joshua in
[1:20:27] Hebrew means Savior and represents the
[1:20:30] promised end time leader to take the
[1:20:33] church over and that's not a
[1:20:36] man Caleb represents the True Believer
[1:20:40] who stayed with
[1:20:42] Joshua God started Israel as a virgin
[1:20:45] with his word but they wanted something
[1:20:48] different so did the last day church now
[1:20:52] notice brother Bram said God did not not
[1:20:54] move Israel until his own appointed
[1:20:58] time now listen brother bam is speaking
[1:21:00] he said now listen this is going to mean
[1:21:03] something and brother Bram was speaking
[1:21:05] about us now he said this is going to
[1:21:07] mean something so I'm telling you this
[1:21:09] but really this is going to mean
[1:21:10] something to you Joshua waited for that
[1:21:15] time no matter how much people might
[1:21:19] have said God gave us the land let us go
[1:21:21] now and take it they might have said
[1:21:24] Joshua you lost your commission you're
[1:21:26] all washed up why are you not doing
[1:21:29] something you used to know thus say the
[1:21:32] Lord in a moment and what was the will
[1:21:34] of God listen but this wise godsent
[1:21:38] Prophet knew the promise of God but also
[1:21:42] knew to wait amen for that promise a
[1:21:46] clearcut decision from God for his
[1:21:51] time in other words nothing would happen
[1:21:54] before it's
[1:21:59] time these Parables now watch but bam
[1:22:02] said and when the time come God gave it
[1:22:04] to Joshua who had stayed with him by the
[1:22:08] word for he could not trust others he
[1:22:12] could trust him so will it
[1:22:16] repeat so God is waiting on
[1:22:19] somebody who will believe but also wait
[1:22:23] until God's time
[1:22:25] you can tell God s it right now God has
[1:22:28] his
[1:22:30] timing his timing for everything just as
[1:22:33] he told them wait in Jerusalem T until
[1:22:36] you be endued with power from on
[1:22:38] high but Lord I already you know I wait
[1:22:40] 10 days I wait 3 days I wait 2 days I
[1:22:43] pray 20 hours and God say time is not
[1:22:46] yet and god holds time to wait for the
[1:22:50] right people to be here Amen to wait for
[1:22:52] the unbelievers to show colors and to
[1:22:55] make Believers to show the because there
[1:22:56] must be a separation of the word bride
[1:22:59] from the church members because the True
[1:23:01] Believers must be identified can the
[1:23:04] church say Amen could you take some
[1:23:08] more from a message proving his word
[1:23:10] brother said now I want you to notice he
[1:23:12] does it that way in every age he does it
[1:23:15] every time by the same method and that's
[1:23:18] why I say friends this gospel is not
[1:23:19] rocket
[1:23:21] science he said I am the Lord and I
[1:23:23] change n
[1:23:25] same yesterday today and forever he does
[1:23:27] it that way in every age he does it
[1:23:30] every time by the same method he has to
[1:23:33] take Believers and then in order to have
[1:23:35] Believers to meet that word he's got to
[1:23:38] predestinate it to that age you see it
[1:23:41] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:23:43] be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:23:45] age brother Bram said did it get you did
[1:23:48] you feel it did you see it do you
[1:23:51] understand it that's what's happening
[1:23:52] today he predestinated did it to this by
[1:23:55] his for knowledge when he predestinated
[1:23:58] in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he
[1:24:01] come over and predestinate anything to
[1:24:03] happen in his word he had to prove his
[1:24:05] word to be so and when he predestinate
[1:24:08] anything to happen and says it will
[1:24:10] happen he knows that seed will be there
[1:24:13] just at that
[1:24:15] time but Bram said he predestinated a
[1:24:17] bride she's going to be there there's
[1:24:20] going to be a Rapture she's going to be
[1:24:22] there he predestines it by his for
[1:24:25] knowledge so there's nothing going to
[1:24:27] stop
[1:24:28] him
[1:24:30] glory he may be
[1:24:33] seated but B they reject the king but
[1:24:35] listen you True Believers in Christ you
[1:24:38] true Christians that believe in God and
[1:24:40] the supernatural all the time Saul was
[1:24:43] training his big army and all those
[1:24:46] intellectuals coming up God had a little
[1:24:48] David out there somewhere feeding his
[1:24:51] father's sheep on sheep food amen amen
[1:24:54] amen the word that's what brother BR
[1:24:56] call it sheep food the word not on
[1:24:58] theological weeds he happened to be
[1:25:00] standing by when that happened when
[1:25:03] Goliath screamed out David just happened
[1:25:05] to be standed by and brother brandham
[1:25:07] said they wanted to give David a
[1:25:09] seminary experience Saul came and said
[1:25:12] try my armor try my sword try my shield
[1:25:15] try my Doctrine try my idea try my
[1:25:18] Revelation try my dream try my prophecy
[1:25:22] but David said I'm not comfortable with
[1:25:24] that I'm used to the same word the same
[1:25:27] signs the same message when the bear
[1:25:30] came when the lion came I use the same
[1:25:33] word and I want to go with the same word
[1:25:36] it doesn't look like a sword it doesn't
[1:25:37] look like a shield I don't need an armor
[1:25:40] because the word is my defense and the
[1:25:42] word is my offense I'm not here to
[1:25:44] defend I'm here to attack because this
[1:25:47] word must bring results and I'm a True
[1:25:49] Believer I don't believe in the sword I
[1:25:52] don't believe in the spear but I believe
[1:25:54] in the god of Israel I believe in the
[1:25:56] god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I don't
[1:25:59] need what you got once I got the word I
[1:26:01] got
[1:26:03] everything somebody give God a shout of
[1:26:06] Praise You may be seated the whole of
[1:26:09] Israel bed down in defeat in unbelief
[1:26:14] listen they didn't believe God could
[1:26:16] deliver them and God had to take some
[1:26:19] money outside of the
[1:26:22] army somebody who wasn't preaching
[1:26:25] somebody who wasn't teaching somebody
[1:26:27] who was off the scene but all he had was
[1:26:29] the word he was just practicing the
[1:26:33] word seven tunders give
[1:26:35] fi the pride is going to have a
[1:26:38] Revival my son is coming
[1:26:41] back my daughter is coming listen it was
[1:26:44] no accident when David hit the bear and

[1:36:18] about to implode judgment has already
[1:36:20] been spoken and those angels are being

[1:36:31] corner and the oxygen Mass are dropping

[1:36:49] to feel the pressure and they're going
[1:36:50] to say give me Jesus Give Me Jesus and

[1:37:17] Brandon was dramatizing the of Jesus
[1:37:20] going to Calvary and he was bringing out
[1:37:22] his drama because he said this was the
[1:37:24] only way God can make a provision for
[1:37:28] the True Believers and brother Brandon
[1:37:30] was dramatizing he said let's look at
[1:37:32] him a few minutes and I'm asking you
[1:37:34] this morning just give us a few minutes
[1:37:36] brother BR said the world's in darkness
[1:37:38] the church in its intellectual
[1:37:41] standpoint has fell to the ground has
[1:37:44] tled the nation itself is in captivity
[1:37:48] it's a dark morning first the sun rises
[1:37:51] pretty and then smoke begin to gather in
[1:37:53] the earth we're standing in the upper
[1:37:55] room in Jerusalem 1900 years ago and
[1:37:59] let's take a little trip now and look
[1:38:01] where our fellowship what happened the
[1:38:03] reason we could have Fellowship let's
[1:38:06] watch it a few minutes and see if it
[1:38:09] isn't on the basis of the shed blood and
[1:38:11] brother bam is dramatizing and you can
[1:38:13] see this Elijah Eagle Prophet is he's
[1:38:16] seeing it in front of his eyes he said I
[1:38:18] see
[1:38:19] him that's how he said I see him I hear
[1:38:23] noise outside the
[1:38:26] window what is it some of them say what
[1:38:30] has he done I see a little woman run out
[1:38:33] in front say what has he done he's only
[1:38:36] healed the
[1:38:37] sick and comforted the poor and brought
[1:38:41] life hope of life to
[1:38:43] us some man smacks her off the street
[1:38:47] said would you hear her instead of your
[1:38:50] own Pastor your priest away with her
[1:38:53] some someone else raises up and say I
[1:38:54] had a leg and he healed
[1:38:59] me take him to the Gallows but is seeing
[1:39:02] it but said I'm listening to something
[1:39:06] bumping let's pull up the shade and look
[1:39:09] out I see coming down the street a sight
[1:39:13] that would break the heart of any Iron
[1:39:16] Man a one that was innocent of any sin
[1:39:20] but yet taken the sin of all the world
[1:39:22] upon him
[1:39:24] never knowed no sin he never one time
[1:39:26] displeased God his
[1:39:29] father there would never was one time he
[1:39:31] did anything that was wrong he was the
[1:39:34] perfect and the only perfect man in the
[1:39:37] world and the imperfect Church condemned
[1:39:40] him to death talk about a place they
[1:39:43] wanted their own organizations their own
[1:39:46] fellowships and so forth but God was
[1:39:49] making a way for the True Believer
[1:39:53] for the real sincere the honest
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] Believers but theam said as said last
[1:40:02] night every time the devil produces a
[1:40:05] Goliath God's got a David somewhere just
[1:40:08] always remembered that now God was
[1:40:11] making a way for the True
[1:40:14] Believer as Jesus had said he said I
[1:40:16] hear it bumping that's the cross bumping
[1:40:18] on the street I look down and see a
[1:40:21] little bitty frail fellow he's got a
[1:40:24] little white robe laying over his
[1:40:27] shoulders wo throughout without a seam
[1:40:29] as he goes down dragging the cross it's
[1:40:31] bumping on the street hitting against
[1:40:33] his head Thorns blood running over his
[1:40:35] face as he starts up the
[1:40:38] hill I noticed some little red dots on
[1:40:41] his
[1:40:42] coat it's question what are those what
[1:40:45] are those little red dots on the back of
[1:40:46] his coat as he goes up the hill as
[1:40:49] farther he goes the brighter those
[1:40:51] little DTS get and The Wider they spread
[1:40:53] spreading father and father and the
[1:40:56] first thing you know all of them go into
[1:40:57] one great big red splot and the Bloods
[1:41:00] are beating across the legs like that
[1:41:02] what was it God making a
[1:41:05] provision for Fellowship
[1:41:08] Hallelujah friends I'm read that quote
[1:41:12] because the True Believers is not based
[1:41:15] on your
[1:41:17] Merit it's based on the
[1:41:21] blood don't ever
[1:41:24] forget the
[1:41:26] blood people know the message and they
[1:41:28] have forgotten about the
[1:41:31] blood arguing about church and politics
[1:41:34] and fellowship and this church again and
[1:41:36] they have forgotten about the blood amen
[1:41:40] a blood that will never lose its power
[1:41:43] Hallelujah a blood price that was paid
[1:41:46] so you could be here that I could be
[1:41:48] here I'm not here by my own strength my
[1:41:50] own Merit I'm on nobody Hallelujah
[1:41:53] trying to tell everybody about somebody
[1:41:56] who took our sins who took our mistakes
[1:42:00] and you don't want to thank God and you
[1:42:03] don't want to worship and you don't want
[1:42:05] to give your whole heart to
[1:42:11] himall May the Holy Spirit touch you
[1:42:14] this morning hallu in the message and
[1:42:17] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:42:21] enemy but the said that's the reason we
[1:42:24] find our organizations failing Falling
[1:42:28] by the wayside it's because when it come
[1:42:30] to the test what test God's word there's
[1:42:34] the test God's word is the test and
[1:42:37] listen to how but Bram put the test he
[1:42:40] said will we do what a bunch of men says
[1:42:44] do or will we do what God says do he
[1:42:48] said that's the difference yes sir
[1:42:54] will we do what a bunch of men says do
[1:42:58] or will we do what God says
[1:43:02] do that's the
[1:43:05] difference there he come the days of
[1:43:07] Dwight Moody the days of finny sankin
[1:43:10] nox Calvin pgeon all the rest of them
[1:43:12] those spiritual men their organizations
[1:43:15] followed after them they've got a bunch
[1:43:18] of men back there that's cut their ways
[1:43:20] into it I'm saying this for a reason
[1:43:22] Church because we cannot be ignorant
[1:43:25] anymore of of these of these things we
[1:43:26] can't just come to church and jump and
[1:43:28] go home and don't know
[1:43:30] anything so I charge you to listen to
[1:43:33] this tape again because we're saying a
[1:43:35] lot of things this morning for a
[1:43:37] specific reason amen we're not playing
[1:43:39] games because life and death is hanging
[1:43:41] in the balance amen I don't care what
[1:43:44] your position is your office your
[1:43:45] station is irrelevant what's important
[1:43:47] is the word and whether or not we
[1:43:49] measure up to the
[1:43:51] word but the man said they've got a
[1:43:53] bunch of men back there that's cut their
[1:43:54] ways into it each one believing this and
[1:43:57] that and adding a little here and taking
[1:44:01] a little away there and adding a little
[1:44:04] here until finally they made an
[1:44:06] organization out of it and when they do
[1:44:10] the real True Believer God comes right
[1:44:14] around and picks up some little humble
[1:44:16] person and breaks that thing to Pieces
[1:44:20] amen always done it God doesn't change
[1:44:23] just tears that thing up to Pieces some
[1:44:28] spiritually minded person people who
[1:44:30] will stay right with that word amen
[1:44:34] yes amen
[1:44:36] wonder I'm heading to the home stretch
[1:44:40] now from the message of sperian church
[1:44:42] age I want you to listen carefully now
[1:44:44] we under home stretch but bam said you
[1:44:47] see the one difference between Israel
[1:44:51] and the rest of the nation Nations was
[1:44:55] God put God to one side and Israel was
[1:44:59] like any other
[1:45:01] Nation when Samson cut off his hair he
[1:45:04] was like any other man put the
[1:45:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[1:45:10] the church is nothing but the world with
[1:45:13] God's name attached to
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:20] it so who is the head of this church the
[1:45:23] Holy Ghost must be the head of the
[1:45:25] church because brother brandham said put
[1:45:28] the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside
[1:45:31] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:45:34] with God's name attached to it listen
[1:45:37] brother Ram goes on he said the world
[1:45:39] and the church are all of the same lump
[1:45:43] just like Jacob and Esau were of the
[1:45:46] same parents but the spirit of God makes
[1:45:50] the
[1:45:51] difference brother B say it doesn't
[1:45:53] matter if you call yourself a Christian
[1:45:56] anyone can do
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:02] that the point is listen whether or not
[1:46:06] you have the spirit of God in you for
[1:46:10] without that Spirit you are reprobate
[1:46:14] and that word reprobate means Rascal it
[1:46:17] means no good it means Troublemaker it
[1:46:20] means good for nothing
[1:46:23] so let me read it
[1:46:25] again anyone can call themselves a
[1:46:28] Christian the point is whether or not
[1:46:30] you have the spirit of God in you for
[1:46:33] without that Spirit you are reprobate or
[1:46:36] you are a rascal or you are no good or
[1:46:38] you are a troublemaker good for nothing
[1:46:40] brother bam said you are none of his and
[1:46:43] then brother B says
[1:46:45] Amen to make sure the picture is caught
[1:46:49] listen to The Prophet not too long ago I
[1:46:51] asked a lady if she were a
[1:46:53] Christian she said to me I will have you
[1:46:56] know sir that I burn a candle every
[1:46:59] night but theom said what in the
[1:47:03] world has that got to do with it I'm a
[1:47:07] Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a
[1:47:10] Pentecostal that hasn't a thing to do
[1:47:13] with it listen to The Prophet it is the
[1:47:15] holy ghost or Parish
[1:47:19] [Applause]
[1:47:24] so it's not just I believe the Thunders
[1:47:27] don't believe the Thunders I believe the
[1:47:29] voice I believe the Trump I believe it's
[1:47:31] the holy ghost or perish in other words
[1:47:34] after the equation 2 + 2 + 5 / 3 is the
[1:47:38] equal sign God is interested
[1:47:43] in jump high jump low let the equal sign
[1:47:46] equal the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:47:51] you if the equal sign if the results is
[1:47:55] not the Holy Ghost then it doesn't
[1:47:56] matter what you have in the
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:05] equation I'm almost
[1:48:08] done listen but continues the same quote
[1:48:12] and I have to read it because a lot of
[1:48:14] people don't read these
[1:48:16] quotes with the B said well starting way
[1:48:18] back there in the first church the
[1:48:20] people got to thinking and reasoning how
[1:48:23] to improve on
[1:48:28] God the Deeds of the nians began showing
[1:48:33] themselves then a group formed they
[1:48:36] drifted away from the pattern of the
[1:48:38] word and listen all it takes is just one
[1:48:42] word changed and that little leav then
[1:48:46] Levens the whole
[1:48:48] lump he that offends in one point of the
[1:48:51] law is guilty of
[1:48:53] all that's the word that's why brother
[1:48:56] Brandon can say full obedience to the
[1:48:58] entire word will entitle you to the
[1:49:01] Token so you know everything but you
[1:49:04] still can't forgive you still can't
[1:49:06] shake my hand you have no Holy Ghost to
[1:49:08] get you have no Rapture to go
[1:49:11] to you can't forgive your husband you
[1:49:13] can't forgive your wife you can't
[1:49:15] forgive and you're going into which
[1:49:18] Rapture which heaven but there are
[1:49:21] places named Heaven Hotel Heaven
[1:49:23] restaurant
[1:49:24] Heaven buses name Rapture maybe it's a
[1:49:30] bus listen but the B said eve just
[1:49:33] changed one word but the B said that
[1:49:36] will do
[1:49:37] it so I'm challenging you Church
[1:49:40] recently a brother said to me a lot of
[1:49:42] people say say what he tape Say Say Say
[1:49:45] and why we need
[1:49:48] preachers I said well brother it is not
[1:49:52] just the preachers have their role to
[1:49:54] rightly divide what brother brandham
[1:49:56] said because he said there will come men
[1:49:57] who will make more sense to it so you
[1:49:59] have to take what brother brandham said
[1:50:02] and he was telling me he was in a
[1:50:03] message Church where the minister just
[1:50:04] preach his own ideas preach his own
[1:50:06] ideas I said that's why we say say what
[1:50:08] the tape say and people say say what the
[1:50:11] tape say and then sit home and listen to
[1:50:12] tapes and forsake the
[1:50:16] assembling to justify their own issues
[1:50:20] God is not interested in your issues
[1:50:22] right
[1:50:24] God is respecting his
[1:50:27] word you want to get God's blessing
[1:50:30] become serious with
[1:50:33] God sometime ago I saw a a woman
[1:50:36] preacher I said not only is it a woman
[1:50:40] preaching but her head is
[1:50:41] cut wearing earrings wearing makeup I
[1:50:44] say no you just compounding the issue
[1:50:46] and when you read this brother B say
[1:50:48] just one word
[1:50:49] off and people stacking this wrong this
[1:50:52] wrong this strong and they saying we all
[1:50:53] going to heaven which
[1:50:55] Heaven why would God s a prophet for us
[1:50:58] to be doing the stuff that the
[1:50:59] Pentecostal Church
[1:51:02] does we have to climb higher friends
[1:51:06] amen amen let me continue reading I'm
[1:51:08] almost done the musician can get ready
[1:51:10] to come up and when that listen to how B
[1:51:13] describe it when that Satan centered
[1:51:15] group was formed it began to hate and to
[1:51:18] fight the True Believers insisting that
[1:51:22] they
[1:51:23] call the aliens were the Church of God
[1:51:26] so the persecution sets in now listen
[1:51:29] notice how organization breathes hatred
[1:51:33] yes it destroys Fellowship it makes
[1:51:36] bitterness that is what m means that is
[1:51:39] what Smyrna was full of bitterness a
[1:51:41] root of bitterness defiles many so more
[1:51:44] and more defilement was coming in and
[1:51:47] every age will feel its
[1:51:51] SC but said the sman church had drifted
[1:51:54] far from the original it had become
[1:51:57] hybrid it had hybridized itself the way
[1:52:00] Eve did you know what a hybrid is what
[1:52:03] comes of two species mixing the result
[1:52:06] is no longer pure like the original it
[1:52:10] is a mongr how you expect to mix this
[1:52:13] with the
[1:52:15] world and get a perfect
[1:52:19] result it's impossible
[1:52:24] amen I'll skip down some of
[1:52:28] this but the B said the church has
[1:52:31] departed from what she originally
[1:52:33] was I'm a Baptist is wasn't so in the
[1:52:36] beginning I'm a Methodist is wasn't so
[1:52:38] in the beginning I'm with this Minister
[1:52:40] I'm with this group I'm with this in the
[1:52:41] message it wasn't so in the beginning
[1:52:43] instead of the straight word of God
[1:52:46] instead of the Spirit-filled men in the
[1:52:49] church who were led by Spirit given
[1:52:51] revelation they are now Creeds and
[1:52:54] bylaws and the educated guesses of
[1:52:58] educated men learning has taken the
[1:53:01] place of Revelation reason has replaced
[1:53:05] fith programs have replaced spontaneous
[1:53:08] praise in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so
[1:53:11] from the beginning the whole species has
[1:53:14] changed it is a hybrid Church listen to
[1:53:17] what brother B asked now when the church
[1:53:19] becomes hybridized will it produce pure
[1:53:22] Christians it can't the life or seed
[1:53:26] that brings Christians to the birth is
[1:53:28] not in them like brings forth like the
[1:53:31] Baptist bring more Baptist the Methodist
[1:53:33] bring Methodist not one is known by the
[1:53:36] power of God they are known by their
[1:53:38] worship and their Creeds and the
[1:53:39] original word will produce the original
[1:53:41] life so church let us get to the
[1:53:44] original word and every one of the
[1:53:48] words the musician could come up
[1:53:53] getting ready to close out here now
[1:53:55] let's touch on my
[1:53:58] scripture Revelation
[1:54:00] 2218 for I testify unto every man that
[1:54:04] Hearth the words of the prophecy of this
[1:54:06] book for If any man shall add unto these
[1:54:10] things God shall add unto him the
[1:54:12] plagues that are written in this book
[1:54:15] and if any man shall take away from the
[1:54:18] words of the prophecy of this of the
[1:54:21] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:54:23] away his part out of the book of life
[1:54:26] this is a serious
[1:54:27] admonition this is how the Bible ends
[1:54:30] friends out of the holy city and from
[1:54:33] the things which are written in this
[1:54:34] book but the BAM said in Ephesian Church
[1:54:37] age it is the changing of even just one
[1:54:41] word by taking away or adding to it it
[1:54:44] is the original trick of Satan in the
[1:54:46] Garden of Eden he just added one little
[1:54:49] word to what God Said and that did it it
[1:54:51] brought death and destruction and in
[1:54:55] Ephesus it was just the same just a word
[1:54:57] added just a word taken away and the
[1:54:59] antiw word Antichrist Spirit began to
[1:55:03] flourish and the B said the Antichrist
[1:55:05] doesn't deny the word but the B said the
[1:55:08] Antichrist believes the word just not
[1:55:11] how it's
[1:55:16] written we really in the word this
[1:55:18] morning amen Amen brother Bram said did
[1:55:21] you get it now now there are those twins
[1:55:23] again there are those two trees growing
[1:55:26] side by side in the same Earth partaking
[1:55:29] of the same nourishment they come to
[1:55:31] church drinking in the same rain and
[1:55:34] benefiting from the same Sun but they
[1:55:36] come from different seeds one tree is
[1:55:39] for the word of God exactly as God gave
[1:55:43] it and loves and obeys it the other tree
[1:55:47] is from the sea that is anti the word of
[1:55:50] God and changes it where it wants to it
[1:55:54] substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas
[1:55:57] for the living true word exactly as did
[1:56:00] Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear
[1:56:03] not little flock brother Bram said stay
[1:56:05] with the word keep that word between you
[1:56:09] and the
[1:56:10] devil Eve did not do that and she
[1:56:14] failed and when the church lets down on
[1:56:17] the word she goes into the depths of the
[1:56:19] darkness of Satan amen can the church
[1:56:22] say Amen
[1:56:25] am brother brandom says these Ephesian
[1:56:28] I'm going to skip some of it these
[1:56:30] Ephesians were Christians they bore a
[1:56:33] name and that name was Christ who was
[1:56:35] the spirit of God within them which was
[1:56:37] a which was one of the threefold names
[1:56:39] of God but B said these Believers
[1:56:41] weren't laboring for Paul or for an
[1:56:44] organization they weren't committed to
[1:56:46] programs and institutions whereby they
[1:56:49] built up H Holdings of value they worked
[1:56:51] for the Lord they were were his servants
[1:56:53] not the porns of the organization they
[1:56:55] didn't go to church on Sunday and talk
[1:56:57] about that name and then forget it on
[1:56:59] the rest of the week they didn't give
[1:57:01] live service to that name no sir it was
[1:57:03] their lives that were given those are
[1:57:06] the True Believers all they did they did
[1:57:09] in that name in that name they acted but
[1:57:12] if they could act in that name then they
[1:57:14] refrain from acting these were Heavenly
[1:57:17] placed Christians whose Behavior was in
[1:57:19] the Lord
[1:57:22] amen but the bandom said but that false
[1:57:25] Vine group that wanted to defile that
[1:57:28] name hung like skulking woles in the
[1:57:30] dark waiting to get in and tear down but
[1:57:32] the Saints stood the test and kept the
[1:57:35] word and the nameall amen amen so that's
[1:57:38] what we are kneeling down here this
[1:57:40] morning friends the True Believers will
[1:57:42] keep every word will defend the word not
[1:57:45] the church defend the word fight for the
[1:57:47] word content for the word fight for the
[1:57:49] word content for the word give me the
[1:57:52] word I don't want nothing else but the
[1:57:53] word because the word is the conductor
[1:57:55] of the spirit and if I live the word the
[1:57:57] spirit must flow the spirit must move
[1:58:00] the spirit must
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:08] operate you could begin to play
[1:58:10] something softly in the message
[1:58:11] Christianity versus idolatry but the BAM
[1:58:14] said that's right you have got to know
[1:58:16] the word stay on the word see the great
[1:58:20] battle is at hand amen amen now we have
[1:58:24] played church for years and years this
[1:58:26] it brother random but the hour comes now
[1:58:29] when Janice and jambres will withstand
[1:58:32] Moses as the Bible said they would and
[1:58:35] it's going to be spiritual battle
[1:58:37] conflict amen there'll be some just
[1:58:40] continue on the denominational church
[1:58:42] will just move right on into
[1:58:43] denomination and go on the way it goes
[1:58:47] but I mean the real True Believer is
[1:58:50] coming to that Battlefield and you'd
[1:58:52] better be Versed and know what you're
[1:58:54] doing or you can take an evil spirit so
[1:58:57] easy and not
[1:58:59] know if it's contrary to this word don't
[1:59:03] believe it stay with that
[1:59:06] word young people the word says stay
[1:59:10] away from Shady
[1:59:12] places a shady place is a place without
[1:59:17] light a place that's unsure a place
[1:59:21] you're not supposed to be him because
[1:59:23] you're not sure you're supposed to be
[1:59:25] there but the brandom said if you're not
[1:59:27] sure don't do
[1:59:31] it that's the word if you stay behind
[1:59:34] the word the devil can't touch
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:37] you so I charge you Church clean out
[1:59:41] your
[1:59:42] houses clean out your lives clean out
[1:59:46] your associations make time to read the
[1:59:49] Bible make time to read the message make
[1:59:52] time to be in
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:55] service where your priorities look in
[1:59:57] the mirror of the word I'm not coming to
[1:59:59] check where you
[2:00:00] at you have to answer for yourself the
[2:00:03] Bible says judge yourself so you
[2:00:05] wouldn't be
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:07] judged you judge yourself by the word so
[2:00:10] you wouldn't be judged and the word is
[2:00:11] coming clear this morning so that you
[2:00:14] can know where you stand are you a
[2:00:16] unbeliever you can't take the word you
[2:00:18] can't take rebuke you can't take it are
[2:00:20] you a make believer you want some of the
[2:00:22] word you want the you want to twist this
[2:00:24] or are you a True Believer Hall and your
[2:00:28] identification is how you stay with that
[2:00:31] word not how you stay with the church
[2:00:34] not how you stay with the pastor how you
[2:00:36] stay with the word because each of us
[2:00:39] have to make our calling and election
[2:00:41] sure because there's a Rapture coming
[2:00:44] and there's judgment coming this is
[2:00:46] reality friends more real than elections
[2:00:48] coming more real than the earthquake
[2:00:51] coming this is reality
[2:00:54] friends I'll close with
[2:00:57] this recognize the call of God's word in
[2:01:00] the E seal and it's an eagle to an
[2:01:04] eagle it's the scream of an eagle there
[2:01:08] was something inside a little fellow
[2:01:09] that he knowed he was an eagle and
[2:01:13] brother Ram said the same thing is with
[2:01:14] every True Believer when the preaching
[2:01:17] of God's word comes forth and is
[2:01:19] Vindicated and proved that it's God
[2:01:21] God's word for this hour then there's
[2:01:24] something within the believer I don't
[2:01:26] care how loyal his father was to the
[2:01:28] church or how loyal his mother was or
[2:01:30] his grandparents and if the church is
[2:01:32] teaching contrary to this hour of the
[2:01:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost message
[2:01:36] there's something in him that screams
[2:01:38] out he will leave that Bard he's got to
[2:01:41] do it the chicken might have been all
[2:01:43] right one day day but this is Eagle hour
[2:01:46] it's different there's something he must
[2:01:48] leave the old coup and fly away Into the
[2:01:51] Blue then this Earthly body is quickened
[2:01:53] and brought by the quickening spirit to
[2:01:56] The Obedience of God's word now when
[2:01:59] this Holy Spirit represented as the
[2:02:01] eagle flying over the land finds the
[2:02:03] believer no man can come unless the
[2:02:06] father draws him and this is where I got
[2:02:10] my inspiration from the message God's
[2:02:11] word called for a total separation from
[2:02:15] unbelief it is a total separation we're
[2:02:18] not to go back into the world no more or
[2:02:21] have anything to do with the world but
[2:02:23] cleave only unto God Jesus is coming
[2:02:27] after a bride a woman a church that's
[2:02:30] separated from the things of the world
[2:02:32] or the cares of the world she is
[2:02:34] separated from the Fashions of this
[2:02:36] Modern Age that we live in she is
[2:02:38] separated from the cares and the
[2:02:39] traditions of churches she is separated
[2:02:43] only to God and God is the word and as
[2:02:46] husband and wife is one so does the
[2:02:49] bride and the word become one for the
[2:02:52] word is living through the bride that's
[2:02:55] how that's her credential that's her
[2:02:58] identification may the Lord richly bless
