[54:25] and transforming into crumb cake so I
[54:31] trust that go help me I always do that
[54:33] because a minute not because I'm trying
[54:35] to talk nice and be humble I really wish
[54:40] that was true but really when you come
[54:44] up to this message here it's tough to
[54:46] you it's tough to find anything else
[54:51] left to say but anyway our trust that
[54:54] girl helped us again this morning anyway
[54:57] I I have a few conduct scriptures Isaiah
[55:02] 55 I think it's verse 7 maybe let me
[55:05] read that brother over the thing read
[55:07] that yesterday because I want to come
[55:11] our this subject of sowing and reaping
[55:15] from a little different angle
[55:27] alright let the wicked forsake his
[55:29] thoughts now let me read it from verse 6
[55:32] the thing that's way brother theory from
[55:34] last night SiC year the Lord while he
[55:36] may be found call ye upon him while he
[55:39] is near let the wicked forsake his way
[55:42] and the unrighteous man his thoughts and
[55:44] let him return unto the Lord and He will
[55:46] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[55:50] he will abundantly pardon I like the way
[55:53] the babble is you know researched things
[55:55] and is a is a rich guys and abundant God
[55:58] and he he has all the works and he and
[56:02] he means every single thing that he says
[56:04] he is an abundant God is a God of
[56:07] abundance so he will pardon he there is
[56:10] nothing there's no sin no wrong that he
[56:13] can't he doesn't have the pattern for
[56:15] his pattern is abundant
[56:18] oh my verse 8 for my thoughts are not
[56:22] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[56:24] ways here the Lord for as the heavens
[56:26] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[56:29] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[56:31] than your thoughts that's really saying
[56:35] something I forgot to say that his
[56:38] thoughts and our thoughts on a totally
[56:40] different level so I got a little for
[56:43] this morning and a little excitation to
[56:47] admonish you to think different and I
[56:51] trust and pray and hope that by the time
[56:55] this convention is done and I know girls
[56:57] really tremendously a bit blessed us in
[56:59] a tremendous manner I wasn't here the
[57:02] first day so means for the Akers message
[57:04] but I suffered a challenge message
[57:06] online when we were coming and I think
[57:09] he was low here is it for you
[57:12] totally outstanding and then yesterday
[57:15] morning brother Isaac there's some that
[57:21] there preaches and there are approaches
[57:23] there are those of us who pretend to
[57:25] preach and they are those who real
[57:27] preach and brother Isaac is one of them
[57:31] ma and charlie is here to reap
[57:34] and they yesterday afternoon the test
[57:36] mission the brothers with an undisturbed
[57:37] so wonderful wonderful so good to meet

[57:55] thank you so much for your words also
[57:57] and last night they rely on the word
[58:06] thank about the fear for those lovely
[58:08] words last night so I who I in a
[58:13] convention after Trina who are in
[58:15] brother Wes estimation in West Palm
[58:17] Beach and brother Theo was there myself
[58:20] but array thumbs in for that chance we
[58:22] are a tremendous John Cena was totally
[58:25] of the chats but always Commission
[58:26] totally of the chats and then when West
[58:30] bumping the phone weakened and immobile
[58:32] Wescoe many of Ross member was
[58:34] performing way back in the past and he
[58:36] had this convention he was absolutely
[58:39] mind-bending stuff
[58:40] it was totally outstanding also and
[58:43] brother fuel myself brother Ray was
[58:46] talking and said we really thoroughly
[58:47] enjoyed the convention I know because
[58:50] we're not preaching so yes come for the
[58:53] service like you do and you go to the
[58:56] room you are relaxed and you come back
[58:58] and you come you get in the service when
[59:01] you have to preach and you see your
[59:03] notes being taken away from you
[59:05] word on top of world on top of world on
[59:08] top of world it's tough to enjoy the
[59:10] convention that way anyway proof for me
[59:15] I don't have much of a message but I so
[59:19] pretend like we're I hear any message
[59:21] okay I'm not trying to tell a lie so
[59:25] just pretend like you're having a you're
[59:27] in a message okay will you do that for
[59:29] me
[59:31] all right so the preachers are already
[59:34] preached all right and the preachers are
[59:36] coming after me to preach so both for
[59:39] those of us who try to make like we are
[59:41] preachers just pretend like you are
[59:43] hearing a message okay all right say
[59:47] preaching Jesus the Bible said when he
[59:49] met those two on the road to Emmaus and
[59:51] he was going he made like he was gonna
[59:54] go beyond because he's decent he won't
[59:58] say I'm gonna come to your house now
[59:59] have any meal for me he wanted them to
[1:00:02] invite him so just do like Jesus be just
[1:00:05] make like you are enjoying the message
[1:00:07] okay all right so my tattoo is a little
[1:00:12] unusual and I hope I will be able to
[1:00:18] like you know get my thoughts together
[1:00:22] macelli's thinking differently thinking
[1:00:26] differently and I blood chels had this
[1:00:31] inspiration
[1:00:32] just like we came from Trina and Bovie
[1:00:35] you know the the harvest and it was
[1:00:38] really totally tremendous and and but
[1:00:43] the child
[1:00:44] you know grows here with sowing and
[1:00:46] reaping that are so in tears shall reap
[1:00:48] in joy and it's a bit about sowing and
[1:00:51] reaping is more important to you than
[1:00:54] you possibly will ever realize but a
[1:00:57] choice and hope that through this course
[1:00:59] of these meetings from other channels I
[1:01:01] mean brother
[1:01:01] Akos message through the channels you
[1:01:03] are getting a bit of a glimpse of what
[1:01:06] it is all about showing and reaping
[1:01:09] because it's a is a principle of life
[1:01:11] that affects you more than you would
[1:01:13] ever think of it's affects you more than
[1:01:16] you catch you understand or care to like
[1:01:20] you know or you might know maybe not
[1:01:22] maybe you care but you might not realize
[1:01:25] the effect is so much like that so I
[1:01:26] just want to talk to you a little bit
[1:01:27] about that and how that you know all put
[1:01:30] together into you thinking differently
[1:01:32] thinking differently as a Christian as a
[1:01:34] believer as a minister whoever you are
[1:01:36] whatever your life's purpose because
[1:01:39] that's how you are going to come to
[1:01:40] perfection
[1:01:41] amen you can do this
[1:01:43] regular thing like everybody else is
[1:01:45] doing and then hope to be you know in
[1:01:48] the rapture it's not gonna walk that way
[1:01:50] the price a little different like what
[1:01:51] the challenge said super rich super
[1:01:53] brannis anyway super brother super
[1:01:56] sister so we're super we're a little bit
[1:01:58] above the regular shade amen you are not
[1:02:02] like everybody else you were different
[1:02:04] from them
[1:02:05] amen and I can't say that our are strong
[1:02:11] enough for young people because there's
[1:02:13] so much attack on the message these days
[1:02:15] that you really wonder and you see the
[1:02:19] cooling off especially among the younger
[1:02:21] folks not everybody just if you can if
[1:02:23] you there but Moses said we will not
[1:02:25] leave one hoof behind so even if it's
[1:02:27] one person is a concern to us but if you
[1:02:31] understand and know and believe the
[1:02:33] revelation of God in his word that you
[1:02:36] were different you and not like
[1:02:38] everybody else God has a special Pope
[1:02:41] was special place for you and bringing
[1:02:42] you in here if you're really honest and
[1:02:45] I believe that and shake yourself and
[1:02:47] pull yourself back then you might begin
[1:02:50] to understand like that is a privilege
[1:02:52] there hanno to be calling to this
[1:02:53] intimation of the hour
[1:02:55] amen because this message is not for
[1:02:57] everybody this makes for a special breed
[1:03:00] a special group of people and you are
[1:03:02] that special group of people
[1:03:04] Oh glory to God amen amen
[1:03:09] let me get my but a few is not seen me
[1:03:12] so let me get my loose sheets together
[1:03:14] here with you you're not looking okay
[1:03:19] this one is you know I mean I'm struck
[1:03:23] with this one here okay let me let me
[1:03:25] let me remove my jacket can I thank you
[1:03:38] it used to be years ago I would preach
[1:03:40] only one put on the jacket but I grew up
[1:03:43] and became more cultured so I put a
[1:03:45] jacket on and once again the poopit
[1:03:47] I remove it so my jackets last a long
[1:03:49] time okay no seriously sir
[1:03:58] so don't feel sorry for me or but always
[1:04:00] good I gotta get my jacket don't don't
[1:04:02] don't spare yourself the thought my
[1:04:04] jacket feels very very new so anyway
[1:04:09] sowing and reaping and I just talked to
[1:04:12] you is the principle of life like I said
[1:04:14] that means much as I could maybe you
[1:04:16] realize because we got seed and Jesus
[1:04:21] said the Word of God is a seed and seeds
[1:04:26] are sown and planted not the words sown
[1:04:30] and planted there's a sewing that they
[1:04:32] planted the two different things a
[1:04:34] little different a little different and
[1:04:36] what is soul you are going to reap amen
[1:04:41] so this principle yeah you wanna apply
[1:04:43] it in every single area of our lives
[1:04:45] more than we ever might understand or
[1:04:49] realize because this principle comes
[1:04:51] from before the formation of the wall
[1:04:52] comes from God's mind before the
[1:04:55] foundation of the wall and this
[1:04:56] principle is table is a standard is a
[1:04:59] principle that permits every single area
[1:05:01] of life
[1:05:03] this principle produce the creation this
[1:05:06] principle of sowing and reaping produce
[1:05:08] a perfect world a prophet earth that God
[1:05:10] created this principle of sowing and
[1:05:13] reaping produce a perfect garden of
[1:05:15] eden' with a perfect man there is son of
[1:05:18] God on the face of the earth standing
[1:05:21] there and I mature God on the face of
[1:05:22] the earth with spoken word power God's
[1:05:25] or Adam and reaped a perfect man because
[1:05:29] Adam was a seat of the world and God
[1:05:31] read a man a son of God that became the
[1:05:36] flesh of the world though what made
[1:05:38] flesh was sowing and reaping amen amen
[1:05:42] so this is a very powerful thought here
[1:05:44] America it comes from God's mine this
[1:05:48] principle produced a profit man on the
[1:05:50] face of the earth
[1:05:51] amen this Mapleton Adam from his seat of
[1:05:54] the world into the flesh of the world
[1:05:56] the world made flesh
[1:05:59] a perfect man stain on the face of the
[1:06:01] earth this critical here mere Adam this
[1:06:04] Supreme Being the supreme create the top
[1:06:06] of God's creation on the face of the
[1:06:09] earth and this same principle is here
[1:06:11] walking on you and I and you know
[1:06:13] Turner's Amen into the capstone bride of
[1:06:16] Jesus Christ the top of God's creation
[1:06:19] in the seven church age is sowing and
[1:06:22] reaping amen if we go in Eden but the
[1:06:27] Bronco actually called Genesis the seed
[1:06:30] chapter of the Bible every seed was
[1:06:33] planned in Genesis imminent that's what
[1:06:35] that's what I prefer him to show us to
[1:06:37] let us know that every seed was then
[1:06:39] Genesis because before if you want a
[1:06:42] manifesto of anything it's gotta be
[1:06:44] planted somewhere there's gonna be a
[1:06:46] sowing frost before there is a
[1:06:48] manifestation or a reaping amen glory to
[1:06:52] God amen glory to God amen amen so
[1:06:57] sowing and reaping is an eternal truth
[1:07:00] of God Amen that works in all of life it
[1:07:04] works within the church it works without
[1:07:06] the church unbelievers used the
[1:07:08] principle and it works for them
[1:07:10] Christians use the principle and it
[1:07:12] works for them the husband used the
[1:07:14] principle arranged is what he works for
[1:07:16] him
[1:07:16] wife uses he works for her the
[1:07:18] businessman used he works for him
[1:07:20] the students use he works for him is the
[1:07:22] principle of life because God put it
[1:07:25] there if a Christian from a source and
[1:07:28] it was nestlings he will reap a harvest
[1:07:30] if an atheist farmer source and observe
[1:07:34] the same principles he will reap the
[1:07:36] same Habash is that right can I get a
[1:07:39] witness back amen amen
[1:07:43] so this principle is not for believers
[1:07:46] alone though we are focusing on the
[1:07:48] believers because that's what we are by
[1:07:51] the grace of Almighty God but I'm just
[1:07:53] going to show you this principle is the
[1:07:54] principle that comes from God and God
[1:07:57] put this principle there to work for men
[1:08:00] and walk in man and walk through
[1:08:02] and is by this principle that you and I
[1:08:04] at the day the people are sowing and
[1:08:07] reaping amen
[1:08:10] now Jesus said the Soraa went is sow the
[1:08:16] seed I had by the rail read a quote one
[1:08:21] time differentiating sowing and planting
[1:08:27] your sewing is more like topsoil it
[1:08:31] doesn't go so deep but planting goes
[1:08:35] much deeper and that's what we are
[1:08:38] similar for planted and sowed the seed
[1:08:42] of the entire Bible so whether it's
[1:08:44] planted or sword it up to you you can
[1:08:48] change that and the Bible says nothing
[1:08:51] but the Oviedo somebody coulda died
[1:08:53] yesterday so break up your fallow ground
[1:08:55] so you have the seed is sword and ready
[1:08:57] break up your fallow ground for it's
[1:09:00] time to seek the Lord because as you do
[1:09:01] that then the city coasts and dip down
[1:09:04] and takes root in your soul and out of
[1:09:07] your belly shall flow the Tree of Life
[1:09:10] growing again Oh hallelujah glory to God
[1:09:15] amen so Prieta seamen are talking about
[1:09:18] the sewing together in my name and
[1:09:21] sowing and reaping amen amen
[1:09:26] produce a harvest in Eden and Adam was
[1:09:29] the fruit of the harvest and this same
[1:09:33] principle will produce in this end time
[1:09:35] here a bride a bride and that's why God
[1:09:39] had a caller after the Prophet
[1:09:40] initiative saw the word to go into the
[1:09:44] prophets message and amen and check off
[1:09:46] his words that he already sold and take
[1:09:49] the same words and and speak them back
[1:09:51] to you and what are those words those
[1:09:54] seeds with tears of revelation and
[1:09:57] inspiration think people over there was
[1:09:59] so much clearer last night as beautiful
[1:10:01] those beautiful bringing the seed the
[1:10:03] watering amen but the preacher the
[1:10:05] watching by the praises outstanding so
[1:10:09] much clarity on the world support
[1:10:11] Malachi 4 brought the world he brought
[1:10:13] the revelation and we come
[1:10:15] a ministry commenting on the prophet and
[1:10:17] with tears of revelation inspiration
[1:10:19] they have water the seats in your soul
[1:10:21] and you take the same word and pick up
[1:10:25] your final crown of your heart and let
[1:10:27] the word go down deep because if the
[1:10:29] series tops all you are not gonna last
[1:10:32] much longer you are not gonna last very
[1:10:34] long if the series topsoil thus it can
[1:10:37] be the best seed if you take a good seed
[1:10:40] and put on this ground here and put some
[1:10:43] soil here on this one here you have you
[1:10:46] have sowed the seed but for that seat to
[1:10:48] really become what it's supposed to be
[1:10:50] you need to a break up this ground and
[1:10:52] let that sit go down deep but God God
[1:10:57] the sower the preacher like through this
[1:10:59] conversion shows the world
[1:11:01] Malekith already solid so we just come
[1:11:03] back to recycle it back so the word and
[1:11:08] when you what comes to you in frozen
[1:11:09] different kinds of our hearts different
[1:11:12] kind of sorrow but you have to take the
[1:11:14] words the seed and say no this little
[1:11:18] beat-up soil you'll break up your fallow
[1:11:20] ground and drink of the word of the
[1:11:23] Spirit and the word goes down deep in
[1:11:26] your soul and begins to germinate
[1:11:29] because the ticke roots and you became
[1:11:31] like solid and no man can shake here no
[1:11:35] man can took up of that word because
[1:11:38] only certain your soul is planted in
[1:11:40] your soul
[1:11:41] so I say Malakoff already come and soul
[1:11:45] and planted the seed of the entire Bible
[1:11:48] and it's in your soul this morning can
[1:11:51] you say amen amen

[1:12:18] so so in Ripon producing Adam a perfect
[1:12:24] man who was living in preeminence ease

[1:12:40] God will help us Amen sowing and reaping
[1:12:45] you and I here today
[1:12:47] Justin leaving believe in God that we
[1:12:52] will be harvested like Adam was a
[1:12:54] perfect man on the face of the earth
[1:12:55] even because the seed has been playing
[1:12:58] our souls and we are respond to that
[1:13:00] seed and we are doing all we know to do
[1:13:02] to pick up a fallow ground so that sheep
[1:13:05] goes deep down and takes root in a
[1:13:09] source on our hats Oh hallelujah
[1:13:12] and like brother Isaac with charities
[1:13:14] get a reap and Charlie will reap all of
[1:13:17] God's Saints have been planted and sewed
[1:13:20] by Malecha for and you are one of those

[1:13:24] so by this principle amen so in a
[1:13:28] reaping man in every area of life
[1:13:31] achieve the purpose that desire every
[1:13:37] purpose of man is as cheap by this
[1:13:38] principle in all of life's areas inside
[1:13:42] the church outside the church you're
[1:13:44] unbelievable friends everybody because
[1:13:47] man is wired by God to live by the
[1:13:49] principles of God whether they

[1:13:53] the rules and reigns in the affairs of
[1:13:54] men he created man and this babble works
[1:13:58] this gospel works even when they don't
[1:14:01] acknowledge it issue what's in their
[1:14:03] lives
[1:14:03] Laura dough God amen oh brother

[1:14:21] seed of the entire Bible in order that a
[1:14:24] perfect brow will come forth and by this
[1:14:26] same principle this bride is gonna be

[1:14:33] charity which is yet a reap now amen
[1:14:37] you know reap a perfect man stand on the
[1:14:40] face of the earth
[1:14:41] in the beauty of his audience don't ever
[1:14:43] let the message become a cliche to you
[1:14:45] just words that are spoken don't let it
[1:14:48] become a cliche to you and the way to do
[1:14:50] that is gonna break up your fallow
[1:14:52] ground your shallow ground break it up
[1:14:55] let the seat go down deep you can't
[1:14:59] afford to be a so-so believer you can't
[1:15:02] afford to be a wishy-washy Christian you
[1:15:04] cannot afford to be a fellow crime
[1:15:06] believer you cannot afford to be a
[1:15:08] shallow ground believer you gotta break
[1:15:10] up your fallow ground leather watch
[1:15:12] check roots if you are the only man in
[1:15:15] your school only get on your Street amen
[1:15:18] your roots are deep and your roots are
[1:15:21] deep and they go way back in to Elohim
[1:15:24] is mine and the devil can shake hear the
[1:15:27] devil can shake hear you believe that
[1:15:30] lorry
[1:15:40] so like I said soil ribbon is a simple
[1:15:45] principle of God and it comes from way
[1:15:49] before the finishing of the world is it
[1:15:52] third God and God have thoughts thoughts
[1:15:55] thoughts on his mind
[1:15:57] I seen a reaping he was one of his
[1:16:01] thoughts one of his principles amen and
[1:16:05] God's thoughts is there are not our
[1:16:08] thoughts his ways are not our ways as a
[1:16:13] field for the Richie or say my thoughts
[1:16:15] are not your thoughts in other words my
[1:16:18] thoughts on sowing and reaping and not
[1:16:24] the same as your thoughts on sowing and
[1:16:26] reaping and I put that you in a minute
[1:16:30] if some my thoughts are not your
[1:16:32] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:16:37] because you have thoughts and then you
[1:16:40] have ways to make those thoughts come to
[1:16:43] pass
[1:16:44] amen and God said for as the heavens are
[1:16:49] high above the earth so are my thoughts
[1:16:53] and your thoughts and my ways higher
[1:16:57] than your ways I have thoughts I have
[1:16:59] ways of going about my things that are
[1:17:02] so much higher than your ways and your
[1:17:05] thoughts that if you take on this up
[1:17:07] here you will never understand what I'm
[1:17:11] about and that's why Jesus came those
[1:17:13] religious people were so earthbound they
[1:17:16] could never figure him out and that's
[1:17:19] why people cannot think of this message
[1:17:20] out because this message here is the
[1:17:22] manna God is the Son of God from the
[1:17:25] formation of the world in so much higher
[1:17:28] than anything this world has ever found
[1:17:30] a man you may be seated
[1:17:43] if you understand what you are received
[1:17:47] what this message represents and I hope
[1:17:53] God will help me to be able to show you
[1:17:55] I hope I don't keep it your one o'clock
[1:17:59] to where you will understand and know
[1:18:04] that the Christian life is easy say easy
[1:18:12] it's easier than living I don't believe
[1:18:14] in life
[1:18:16] he says hard life is hard you may be
[1:18:21] seated
[1:18:21] life is hard go as the baby in the womb
[1:18:25] waits protected everything it wants to
[1:18:28] eat it kicks his mother some more makes
[1:18:30] the mother feel hungry the mother eats
[1:18:32] food and the baby gets fed but once the
[1:18:36] time comes the baby comes of age that
[1:18:38] baby comes on the face of the earth here
[1:18:40] it's very first second on the earth you
[1:18:42] say welcome to the world baby
[1:18:45] is it to fall you are in so don't tell
[1:18:48] me Kristen is tough because going to
[1:18:49] school is tough going to work is tough
[1:18:52] going to the family families talk
[1:18:54] everything is tough life is tough but
[1:18:57] compared to all of that this cosplay is
[1:19:00] easy because god is your enabler
[1:19:04] combated easy for you to live a
[1:19:07] Christian life unless you don't want to
[1:19:09] is not hard on us
[1:19:13] it's easy can I use a man or a you may
[1:19:24] be seated
[1:19:31] it'll be so out of character for God to
[1:19:35] make living a Christian life force under
[1:19:39] knowledge difficult so out of character
[1:19:41] for God you say he will abundantly
[1:19:43] pardon he said I come that you might
[1:19:47] have life and have it more abundantly
[1:19:49] so he's he had to give you a Ponton help
[1:19:51] you are the only one in your school is
[1:19:54] he here to give you a pond on hell what
[1:19:56] you cannot do for you sir
[1:19:57] the practical do for yourself he cannot
[1:20:00] do that for you because you can plant a
[1:20:02] seed and pick up the fallow ground in
[1:20:04] your natural and your natural one and
[1:20:06] put the seal in there but if the seed
[1:20:09] has to do some things of itself you pour
[1:20:13] water and over but thats it has to break
[1:20:16] out itself die and Jesus says in John
[1:20:19] 12:24 I believe accept the current
[1:20:22] without falling to the ground and dad it
[1:20:26] applies alone boy falls to the ground I
[1:20:30] I shall bring forth fruit and more fruit
[1:20:32] a much fruit that's your you get a break
[1:20:39] up your fallow pee on yourself and do
[1:20:40] the dying yourself I can't do the time
[1:20:43] for you you can do the time for me your
[1:20:45] pastor can do the time for you you can
[1:20:48] do the damn for yourself for anybody
[1:20:50] else you get a do the time for yourself
[1:20:52] that's a break up your fallow ground
[1:20:54] break up your spirit break up your own
[1:20:57] ways
[1:20:58] break up yourself styles break up your
[1:21:01] spirits upon you you may be seated or
[1:21:15] glory amen
[1:21:19] so like Adam where God's seed got seed
[1:21:24] of his word I like Adam we're gonna be
[1:21:29] reap as the flesh of the world the word
[1:21:33] made flesh and that's why I say Malaka
[1:21:35] for already sold and planted the seed of
[1:21:39] the entire Bible and we have the see we
[1:21:43] have the word on people GN like but an
[1:21:46] analyst yesterday how dare you speak
[1:21:47] against the message but if you want to
[1:21:50] go on ahead
[1:21:50] but the angels here in it not
[1:21:52] threatening you not wouldn't fail you
[1:21:54] but the angel is hearing it when Ottoman
[1:21:58] is so we're higher than the closest
[1:22:01] which is panic oh so much higher they
[1:22:03] are fine painting cross-reference fine
[1:22:05] they pretty water God you here wow this
[1:22:07] is incredible this is great but when it
[1:22:10] comes to it is top speed yo it's subsea
[1:22:12] it doesn't go way back
[1:22:14] before the finishing of the world only
[1:22:17] one man William Branham have their
[1:22:19] ministry
[1:22:21] revelation 1 if you say stop william
[1:22:25] branham you gotta find that man or
[1:22:27] you're gonna stay at pounds because
[1:22:30] Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] which God gave to him and which is sent
[1:22:36] by his angel unto his servant John
[1:22:39] you've got to find who that angel is if
[1:22:42] you say so Malachi 4 that's fine but you
[1:22:45] gotta friend that angel because that
[1:22:47] revelation is going to show you things
[1:22:49] that are to be things that were before
[1:22:53] the words were formed things that are
[1:22:55] the things that are to be no man no
[1:22:58] other man has done ministry to check you
[1:23:01] to the man of God and bring God's
[1:23:03] thoughts down to you and I so we are the
[1:23:06] privileged this morning we are the
[1:23:08] thoughts of God in the form of a message
[1:23:10] so far higher than anything this world
[1:23:15] can ever produce so far higher than
[1:23:18] anything regular Christianity can ever
[1:23:21] produce that you say
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:39] so let me show you that God's thoughts
[1:23:43] are so much higher than our thoughts so
[1:23:47] much higher than our ways because I'm
[1:23:52] got sword I'm planning his world he rip
[1:23:57] perfection
[1:23:58] he saw his word let there be light and
[1:24:02] there was light and he has never had to
[1:24:05] make this song any better since he did
[1:24:08] it one time it's been as perfect as
[1:24:12] puffy could be if man could touch the
[1:24:15] Sun they would have changed it but God
[1:24:18] made sure you can't touch the Sun you
[1:24:21] just bask under the glories of the Sun
[1:24:24] God spork let there be light and there
[1:24:27] was light and it's never had to work on
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:30] his sword I'll read right away
[1:24:34] a perfect Sun that's been there ever
[1:24:38] since and the Bible says I believe in in
[1:24:41] Sam something he said is said as for God
[1:24:44] his way is perfect
[1:24:48] so when go saw some plants he always
[1:24:52] comes forth on the other side are they
[1:24:54] have a sweet perfection is that clear
[1:24:57] do you believe that the source he plans
[1:25:01] it comes out with a prophet fruit mother
[1:25:05] harvest glory
[1:25:08] Oh glory but us nothing man does it's
[1:25:19] perfect the same principle sowing and
[1:25:21] reaping God applies the principle it
[1:25:24] comes out perfect world first day God
[1:25:28] created at the end of the day God saw
[1:25:30] everything he did was good in other
[1:25:32] words was perfect
[1:25:33] second day God said let there be this
[1:25:36] and let the other bring forth and all
[1:25:37] that and God saw it was good in other
[1:25:40] words was perfect the sword and the
[1:25:44] spoken what is the original seat that is
[1:25:46] sword the sword let their animals
[1:25:49] comfort let me let me let the sea bring
[1:25:51] for us and all of that and God saw that
[1:25:55] it was good every song I'm planting God
[1:25:59] did was perfect I'm good
[1:26:01] so why is I also implying not producing
[1:26:04] the same results because we are on a
[1:26:09] different plane from him or rather is on
[1:26:11] a different plane from us say as they
[1:26:13] have reserved of the earth so I my waist
[1:26:17] up of your wish I my foot above your
[1:26:19] thoughts Oh God Almighty already glory
[1:26:30] so each time God sort his word he said
[1:26:34] he reflects in every single time and we
[1:26:38] also saw in reap but unlike God we don't
[1:26:43] reap perfection
[1:26:44] nothing man does is perfect amen but
[1:26:48] like some 18 and verse 30 says as for
[1:26:51] God his way is perfect but we have never
[1:26:56] been able to come to that yet and we'll
[1:26:58] come to that because he is sent a word
[1:27:01] the maracas for some planning all of
[1:27:03] that a prophet Brad will come forth to
[1:27:07] where she will speak and the Warwick
[1:27:09] reserved just like that and you will see
[1:27:12] and see that it is good exactly what
[1:27:15] your sport will come to pass
[1:27:18] nor will goddamn hand that's why when
[1:27:21] got a precious gift in a proper to
[1:27:23] whoever there's no magic Vera wanker
[1:27:27] splits into a profit is exactly on the
[1:27:29] spot if it doesn't happen one time he is
[1:27:33] a problem there and these guys are spent
[1:27:35] all their lives leno show and see what
[1:27:38] brother brahma said some they're not
[1:27:39] happen you won't find it
[1:27:40] you can't cook stuff up and disappear
[1:27:44] all who are tune of disobedience while
[1:27:47] you will not be see the bride because
[1:27:49] the bride shall never be deceived a man
[1:27:59] or a god swords and rips perfection or
[1:28:12] the challenge we sow and reap and with
[1:28:16] re perfection it means therefore the
[1:28:18] gosh thoughts also in a ribbon I wish
[1:28:21] superior to our thoughts on so in a
[1:28:24] ribbon far higher than our thoughts on
[1:28:29] sowing and reaping does that make sense
[1:28:31] to you
[1:28:33] hallelujah nor will God so God's
[1:28:37] thoughts are totally on a totally more
[1:28:41] elevated level than our thoughts because
[1:28:45] it's those produce a perfect health it
[1:28:48] was produced a perfect game of Eden is
[1:28:50] the produce a perfect creation
[1:28:52] it starts produce a perfect man stand on
[1:28:55] the face of the earth
[1:28:55] Amen and we've never been able to do
[1:28:58] that just yet little God now that's the
[1:29:01] difference between your thoughts and
[1:29:02] your thinking let me make that clear
[1:29:04] before I go on but as I'm speaking I'm
[1:29:09] using them interchangeably but as a
[1:29:11] difference very bit differently your
[1:29:13] thoughts and your thinking the opposite
[1:29:15] I have thoughts first in my mind I'll
[1:29:18] show you how those thoughts come but God
[1:29:22] had thoughts on his mind
[1:29:23] how thoughts in mind I was no quitter
[1:29:25] all what was gonna be like thoughts in
[1:29:27] his mind who was gonna be saved who was
[1:29:30] gonna be saved but that wasn't his
[1:29:31] thinking
[1:29:32] thousands thinking the file is a
[1:29:43] powerful thing but the thinking is more
[1:29:45] powerful I was no really scripture I
[1:29:48] think I forgot let this mind be in you I
[1:29:52] believe it's Philippians the second
[1:29:56] chapter verses 5 to 11 you can read when
[1:29:58] you get home ask if it was on my
[1:30:01] contacts and wanama scriptures let this
[1:30:03] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:30:08] Jesus who thought it not robbery to be
[1:30:12] equal with God that's a very perplexing
[1:30:16] scripture but I'll show you that's
[1:30:19] captured speaking about nothing about
[1:30:20] what the three for mystery of God
[1:30:22] because it's only by the three for
[1:30:24] mission of God that you're gonna see
[1:30:25] like that it's not robbery to be equal
[1:30:27] with God because God determined before
[1:30:29] the nation of the world God in Christ
[1:30:31] Christ in the bride going back to Eden a
[1:30:34] perfect man on the face of the earth
[1:30:36] I'm not your God's on the face of the
[1:30:38] earth so that was the three from Misha's
[1:30:40] was being spoken out there Jesus Christ
[1:30:43] sorry no robbery to be equal with God he
[1:30:49] needs us women I just go and take it
[1:30:50] something that your labor and fight for
[1:30:55] it's not a gift it's something you labor
[1:30:58] and fight for but it's already given to
[1:31:00] you
[1:31:01] Amen oh my lord I saw your thoughts all
[1:31:05] kinds of first come in your mind you can
[1:31:08] say I have thoughts I have bad thoughts
[1:31:10] first the devil's job to put bad sauce
[1:31:12] in your mind but if you don't understand
[1:31:14] that's what you're thinking that they
[1:31:16] will fool you because that is not your
[1:31:18] thinking amen another scripture says
[1:31:22] Amen I believe that is a Philippians 4
[1:31:27] and verse 8 say whatsoever things are
[1:31:31] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:31:33] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:31:35] things of a good report in other words
[1:31:38] there are different thoughts pure
[1:31:41] thoughts
[1:31:41] lovely thoughts good thoughts
[1:31:45] good reports all those thoughts are
[1:31:47] there this how you can you're thinking
[1:31:50] whatsoever things appear a lovely a
[1:31:53] harness of a good report think on these
[1:31:57] things you choose deliberately choose
[1:32:05] the thoughts you think on
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:12] any thought can come in your mind you
[1:32:15] can't tell the devil don't put this
[1:32:17] funny money on your mind heels chopped
[1:32:19] up what's on your mind but it's your job
[1:32:21] to choose your thinking let this mind be
[1:32:25] in you whatsoever things are pure that's
[1:32:28] what you think of that's what you think
[1:32:30] on these things glory glory
[1:32:32] can somebody shout hallelujah well let
[1:32:36] me say let me say that again you maybe
[1:32:39] see that I'm just talking to you
[1:32:42] Amen the preacher the preacher right LEM
[1:32:44] just what y'all started to you they may
[1:32:46] be seated
[1:32:48] are you following me are you falling out
[1:32:51] story the beautiful story of redemption
[1:32:54] your thoughts and your thinking two
[1:32:58] totally different things
[1:33:00] and brother Branham said your thoughts
[1:33:03] that's in your mind your mind that's the
[1:33:06] battle ground you have good and you have
[1:33:09] bad there the devil pushes for there
[1:33:12] goes forsythia - but it's up to you to
[1:33:17] choose your thinking and he said
[1:33:19] whatsoever things appear in other words
[1:33:22] of all the thoughts in your mind be
[1:33:25] deliberate be intentional to take the
[1:33:28] good thoughts the pure thoughts the
[1:33:31] harnessed thoughts the good reports that
[1:33:35] if he hear you think those thoughts will
[1:33:37] know you have a good report take those
[1:33:40] and think on those things and meditate
[1:33:43] on those things and as you do that those
[1:33:45] thoughts become your thinking as a man
[1:33:48] thinking in his head
[1:33:49] so easy that's not you from who you are
[1:33:53] that's how you become who you are the
[1:33:56] devil can make you what he wants to be

[1:40:16] gonna like I said that's speaking right
[1:40:18] there of a three full ministry of god
[1:40:20] that was the only revelation that who
[1:40:23] will make Jesus Christ the nothing is
[1:40:25] robbery to be equal with God he knew the
[1:40:27] process you don't just break in and get
[1:40:29] the character of a son of God he knows
[1:40:31] the process the steps the procedure I
[1:40:34] know that God by spearonation
[1:40:36] Amen church with him before the
[1:40:38] formation of the world and he knows the
[1:40:39] priesthood not to be equal with God when
[1:40:42] his wasn't robbery he was president of
[1:40:44] people come with God but I know he's not
[1:40:45] robbery there's a process that the step
[1:40:47] in successive steps now to get there and
[1:40:50] jesus knew that so that's speaking about
[1:40:51] the fee for ministry and when we become
[1:40:53] a Christian I said when come in this
[1:40:55] message here we enjoined to get rid of
[1:40:57] our thoughts and begin to think his
[1:41:01] thoughts because we're going back to
[1:41:03] Eden amen
[1:41:06] we've got to go back first to the
[1:41:08] thoughts and the thinking that produce
[1:41:10] Eden in the first place or we'll never
[1:41:12] go about there that's what won't you
[1:41:15] everybody else talking the my vision is
[1:41:18] always a very popular topic um offer any

[1:41:30] produce it in the first instance but the
[1:41:32] perm said if you split the world by the
[1:41:34] same thinking that produce the word in
[1:41:38] the first place you will get the same
[1:41:41] resource and this process here is about
[1:41:45] God walked in on the inside of us to get
[1:41:48] us to move our thinking to a totally
[1:41:51] different level by his preeminence is in
[1:41:53] our souls in our hearts in our lives the
[1:41:56] water God living in you and I in
[1:41:58] preeminence Oh
[1:42:01] hallelujah hallelujah oh mama
[1:42:08] amen lorry let this mind be in you which
[1:42:16] was also in Christ Jesus whatsoever
[1:42:19] things appear think on these things
[1:42:22] because the man thinketh in his heart so
[1:42:26] he adds and leaves so is he your
[1:42:30] thoughts your thinking that's your inner
[1:42:34] man that's your spirit man on the inside
[1:42:37] of you there's a spiritual heart on the
[1:42:39] instead of you I don't which flow all of
[1:42:42] your life all the issues of the life
[1:42:44] come from that thinking in that spirit
[1:42:48] man on the instead of you Oh
[1:42:51] unfortunately too many of us funny very
[1:42:55] difficult to elevate our thinking to
[1:42:58] God's level of thinking does never love
[1:43:01] thinking for you your second senses your
[1:43:05] life your job your Christian walk your
[1:43:08] family your career your job for every
[1:43:13] area of your life we find it so
[1:43:15] difficult to elevate our thinking to the
[1:43:18] level that goes is my thoughts are
[1:43:22] higher than your thoughts
[1:43:23] I'm always higher than your ways and
[1:43:25] when you come up to his level of
[1:43:27] thinking you will see the way how he
[1:43:29] achieves that thinking to make it coming
[1:43:32] to a manifestation but why you stay and
[1:43:34] your level of thinking you'll be
[1:43:36] struggling against the booze and trying
[1:43:39] to make those thoughts come to pass
[1:43:41] I'm a Christian and you are struggling
[1:43:43] there's no struggling Christian if you
[1:43:46] are struggling as a Christian some is
[1:43:47] not right young man hear me young woman
[1:43:50] hear me if you are struggling as the
[1:43:51] Christian something is not right
[1:43:54] the only way a Christian struggles your
[1:43:57] struggle and prayer with God to get on
[1:44:00] your knees bagi at the knees you are
[1:44:02] laboring soul shall fail with God but a
[1:44:06] Christian don't struggle to not sing
[1:44:08] glory to God a man can I get a witness
[1:44:12] back I can hear you a Christian don't
[1:44:15] struggle to not sin because the speed of
[1:44:18] God this speed are cut off a came the
[1:44:21] devil how are you going to struggle
[1:44:23] against the devil anymore the daily
[1:44:27] struggle against Goliath Israel struggle
[1:44:30] but not David they will run into the
[1:44:33] army grunting aloud with confidence
[1:44:35] that's a fast shadow of a Christian
[1:44:38] hallelujah there's a challenge we don't
[1:44:40] deny that a challenge there but we face
[1:44:43] it an elevated level of thinking
[1:44:46] God's level of thinking and we said to
[1:44:49] every challenge this Egyptians your city
[1:44:52] there you shall see them no more forever
[1:44:58] you say like David you come against me
[1:45:01] the name of your gods but I come against
[1:45:04] you in the name of the Lord color they
[1:45:07] have a very earth whom you have defied
[1:45:09] don't you understand you may be seated
[1:45:15] don't you understand you may be seated
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:29] don't you understand that every
[1:45:32] challenge that comes at you to make the
[1:45:35] water god looks like it's a lie don't
[1:45:38] you understand that that challenge is to
[1:45:41] find the god of the heavens and the
[1:45:42] earth and David without the Holy Ghost
[1:45:48] he said I will not stand for it I will
[1:45:51] not let you to find my god or defy his
[1:45:55] armies and David went to face Goliath
[1:46:01] every challenge I was like a Goliath you
[1:46:03] face it at an elevated level of thinking
[1:46:06] we are not going to print like Israel
[1:46:08] we're going to face it and we're gonna
[1:46:11] profess how's it go on
[1:46:12] you'll fall at my feet those are not
[1:46:15] man's words as my thoughts are higher
[1:46:18] than the earth so are my thoughts on my
[1:46:21] ways higher than your ways
[1:46:23] [Applause]
[1:46:35] proceeded israel and saw their thoughts
[1:46:41] where grasshoppers before Goliath to
[1:46:45] forego lieth you need years of
[1:46:46] experience that's the way to to bring
[1:46:49] this victory the comparison is years of
[1:46:51] experience you need this ammo that you
[1:46:54] wear the ammo you are called by
[1:46:57] everywhere that's man's thoughts and his
[1:47:01] ways to achieve what he thought what
[1:47:05] needs to be achieved but come to a man
[1:47:08] who has reached that level the elevated
[1:47:12] level of thinking thinking differently
[1:47:15] than the rest of the group who care
[1:47:17] nothing about being popular with the
[1:47:19] rest of the group
[1:47:20] mi wash can alone if you have to stand
[1:47:23] alone stand alone hallelujah and David
