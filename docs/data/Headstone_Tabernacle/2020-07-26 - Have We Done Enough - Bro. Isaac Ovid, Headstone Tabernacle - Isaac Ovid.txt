up the challenge and standing with our pastor for executing the job so beautifully it was perfectly done god's richest blessing to all sister marcia de leon we appreciate that this morning amen and another note of praise i wish to give almighty god a high note of praise and also to thank each of you for your prayers the two procedures which i did on the 30th of june were both successful a couple minor things were found which are treatable with antibiotics and other medication nevertheless all the really bad things that the doctors thought may have been the root cause of my illness and which i must admit caused me great concern i'm happy to report that nothing was found to god be the glory hallelujah i still have one or two other medical procedures to be done however i do believe in my heart that they will also be negative and that all will be l with me in the mighty name of jesus all praise honor and glory to the most high god the great physician god riches blessings to all from

impossible to feel lord the god that you are that you could see us at the point of our need lord and when the doctors don't know what to do and the doctors are confused and the doctors are perplexed father lord there is nothing that is too confusing for you there's nothing that lord perplexes you and father time and time again against the odds as it were lord you made the impossible possible you

this service this morning as we approach your word this morning may you take me out of the way may you speak to your sons and your daughters lord may this be a different kind of a service lord i don't know what's going to happen today but there's an anointing in this place there's an atmosphere in this place and it's the anointing that makes a difference it's the atmosphere that makes a difference it's the presence of the angel of the lord that makes a difference so we thank you for the anointing we thank you for the unction we thank you for the presence we thank you for the angels that have surrounded this building we thank you for your power we thank you for your promise we thank you for your word may you walk out the pages of the bible may you step out from the quotes this morning and may we have a time in the presence of the lord lord if there's a backslider here today may they leave completely delivered if there's someone desiring the holy ghost may they be filled and father may you protect your people all hell is against this revelation but we stand firm we are resting on this because just as the prophet preached what paul preached we preach what paul preached and we preach what the prophet preached may you open our understanding to your word this morning and minister to the years of salvation we commit the service into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen appreciate the song service this morning i appreciate the worship we appreciate our brother gideon appreciate the musicians amen just before we read the scripture i'd like to take this time to wish our sister anne-marie over the happy birthday today our precious wife of our pastor but branham said when god call a man he calls his wife and we have seen such a testimony in our life so we pray that god would touch her i know she wasn't feeling too well yesterday but we pray that god would touch her completely and she'd continue to press until we leave this place so happy birthday stoverd thank you for what you do behind the scenes amen so if you have your bibles this morning and certainly greet one and all in the precious name of jesus christ this uh exhortation this morning to the church kind of talk a little bit fellowship a little bit i want to read from three portions of scripture reading from uh ii peter 1 reading from ii timothy 4 and reading from revelation 10 this morning and reading from 2nd peter 1 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power have given us given unto us all things that pertain onto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your feet virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the raja veteran give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things do ye know them you know them already but i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things that's what we are here to do this morning although we know them we will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things so we are here to remind ourselves today though you know them that he be established in the present truth turning to second peter four and reading from verse seven second peter four and verse seven i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the fate henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing you know last reading revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound a mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord today we are so happy to be able to be here in fellowship and we know what's happening uh around the world we know what's happening in the country as well and it's it's so much to say about it uh but i'm i don't know how about you but i'm still feasting on the convention you're still feasting on the convention there was so much that was said that you could always just connect back and get some encouragement there and how many appreciate about obese message last week sunday the dynamics of that promise would oh what a tremendous time in the lord and on wednesday night if you missed it you need to get it the letter kill it but the spirit gave it life what a masterpiece on wednesday night put in the spirit in its place in the church because there's so much that people know there's so much knowledge there's so much information but and we'll see it in today's service it has to lead to something it has to produce something it has to do something there's a lot of people who have knowledge and information and can interpret this and interpret that and we'll see about it has to lead us into a place of action so it has to be the spirit that drives the action it can't just be word only because we know the gospel is not in word only but it is in power and demonstration so are you with me this morning so we see what's happening around us we see new cases coming into the country we knew we see the the news and the people and everything is happening at the same time there's there's in the political realm we have elections coming up and all of a sudden we have these new cases there's economic turmoil everything is building to something and it should not come as a surprise to us but we also have our our part to play we also have our responsibility and we have our responsibility to be ready that is the great responsibility the great responsibility is not measured by attendance in church that has its place but the great responsibility is to be ready because you don't want to pass the grade for attendance and not be ready you don't want to pass the grade for knowing the message and not be ready you don't want to pass the grade for being on fire and not be ready all of these things are important you don't want to pass the grade for praying and not be ready you don't want to pass the grade of being spiritual and not being ready it is important to do these things but make no mistake about it you need to be ready and that's why i read this scripture we have a responsibility to make our calling and election show that is a responsibility it's a daily responsibility when you wake up in the morning it's i gotta be sure i want to be sure i can't afford to take a chance not in this season not in this season when the enemy is moving around not in these seasons when we see plagues on every hand not in this season when the lid of hell is open and streams of demon powers are moving or not in this season i want to be very sure my confidence cannot be based on man my confidence cannot be based on the church i attend my confidence cannot even be based on my understanding or my revelation it has to be confident in the fact that he said not i said but he said this is my beloved son it is not us being identified with him but it is he being identified with us can the church say amen so i'm excited this morning because i see the season is changing and it's happening so quickly that if you don't have spiritual eyes you will see it as business as usual so may god anoint your eyes with eyes out this morning and i encourage you and for those on the internet i want you to know i'm preaching to the church this morning i'm preaching the headstone tabernacle this morning if you are blessed i welcome you i appreciate you i encourage you when i'm speaking to the church this morning and we are an open church we speak to be a blessing to anybody who wants to be blessed hallelujah we have no agenda we're not telling anybody attend this church join this church follow this church that's not the ministry here hallelujah we are preaching to this local church if it's a blessing to you then thank god and you worship god and use it as a blessing to you so i greet those who are connected to be blessed i also greet those who are connected who want to criticize because you can't stop the critics but i want to encourage you don't stress yourself out if you come to criticize we're not forcing anybody to connect to this we're not encouraging people to stress out yourself to find out what we're preaching we preach this on the revelation of god that he has given to us so if you don't like noise don't criticize the noise that we have here because from the limited understanding i have of the word but the branham said if there's no noise there's no god until i can see more than that understanding don't let the noise bother you don't let our worship bother you don't let that was standing up don't stress yourself out don't let your blood pressure go up high you don't have to connect to this service but if you connect to the service i can assure you you're gonna hear some shouting you're going to hear some singing you're going to hear some dancing we worship in a way that the world will call heresy even within the message they may call it heresy but don't try to tie me down by your interpretation or revelation of the word this is a sovereign church oh my god deals with individuals and this is an individual church made up of individuals who have seen their name because once you say your name it makes you act a certain way walk a certain way talk a certain way behave a certain way you may be seated [Applause] there are many people get stressed out but always said it about two bible says ago there's no space in his head for anybody else we're not bothered by what anybody else is doing every church is sovereign you could preach what you want to preach you could teach what you want to teach but you can't come and tell us what we have to preach or what we have to teach we are responsible for those who have made this church their home church that's the limits of our responsibility we have no other responsibility beyond the tight paying members of this church who have made it their home church so don't stress yourself out and say oh gosh that's what we're always preaching that's what the eyes are preaching we will preach this way until god tells us otherwise because we report only to god can the church say amen and your confidence must be peace and hearing from god you may be seated my confidence cannot be based on whatever it says he's the pastor of this church but paul taught us he said follow me as i follow christ i always teach that follow me as i follow christ so i'm watching the pastor but i'm watching christ i'm watching the past and i'm watching christ i'm watching the past and i'm watching christ because i gotta make sure because if he is leaving away from christ and i don't want to be there but if it's heading to christ if it's pointed to christ if it pointed to the rapture pointing to the resurrection pointing to the baptism of the holy ghost pointing to revelation after revelation then you don't even try to stop me you you may be seated [Applause] there are 8 billion people on this planet and we're going to get into it why i'm going here why would you be stressed with what another church is doing 1.4 million people in trinidad and tobago there are a lot more people that you can go and testify to than stress out about what we're doing in this church and that applies around the world we need to have a bigger vision of the call of god on our lives can the church say amen can i preach now you know where i'm standing you know where you're standing may the lord bless you i'm feeling good [Applause] just to know i've been redeemed makes me feel good hallelujah you imagine if the if the wise man one bothered because he that brought up goldberg goldberg and the lord opened up frankincense and wondering if this frankincense message i have this morning has any place and whenever this message of murder that we bring in this morning have any place each one had their individual revelation but in the economy of god god is the one who connects the dots and when he connected it it brought a whole message can the church say amen so put on your spiritual hats this morning just to encourage the church a little bit i want to take us all back into history before i bring present tense the day was sunday december the 30th 1962 sunday december 30th 1962. just about four months before our country would have just achieved independence from the british john f kennedy is the president in the united states in that year history would record the cuban missile crisis the formation of the european space agency the release of the first beatles record in that year would signal the first k-mart the first walmart a lot was happening in that year and the day was sunday december 30th 1962 god's prophet had just finished preaching in shreveport the countdown and he followed that message a countdown with four messages in jeffersonville remembering the lord the falling apart of the world the reproach for the cause of the word and the absolute he finds himself in an evening service speaking about how long he would have kept the people that morning but he felt compelled to come that evening to address a few things he is speaking on a subject on this evening is this the sign of the ends as he goes deeper into his thought his message his subject he begins to touch on certain things for one of the few moments in his entire ministry he would say i don't know what i'm about to say i'm not sure what i'm doing and he said it's weird for a minister to say that to him that i've not been this way before and many things are said in that message she speaks about the blast that would signal his new ministry his new commission he first thought it meant he was going to die but this is 1962 he is trying to figure out what's going on but something is pressing upon him in that message he touches certain things he said but tonight i'm going to speak on something that i do not know and now that's quite a thing for a minister to say that he's going to speak on something that he doesn't know about but i'm adventuring out to the best of my knowledge that this church might understand he's trying to bring them to a spot and he says later on we know that we are living in a glorious time for the church but a horrible time for the unbeliever and we're living in one of the most dangerous times of all all that ever was since the world began no prophet no apostle never in no time ever lived in such a time as we live now this is the end he said it's written in the skies it's written over the face of the earth it's written in every newspaper i was just seeing recently this whole covet 19 coronavirus situation they're talking about vaccine they're talking about treatment and recently just a few days ago the doctor saying they're realizing that this is something man has to live with for some time it could be years could you imagine when the world thinks there's an easy release or easy fix or an easy solution or it will just disappear it said it could be years we don't know and the world doesn't know but god is the one holding these pieces together it's written in every newspaper this is the end he said if you could read the handwriting i'm in a background i'm trying to get somewhere i haven't announced my title yet the prophets lived in the time when the handwriting was on the wall for a nation but we are living when the handwriting is on the wall for time so it's not just the end of a nation or the end of a people or the end of a government or the end of countries this is the handwriting is on the wall speaking to the end of time and the end of time means the all the end of all things that are temporal or temporary or created for this construct that we call time can the church say amen all nations earth everything time is at the end so we must search the scriptures to find the hour that we are living always a true prophet of god will go to the scriptures therefore he is absolute when it's going to be that way in the old testament when prophet said anything there always somewhere was a prophet with the word who stayed with the word he watched god for visions and if his vision was contrary to the word then his vision was wrong that's god's way of getting his word to the people and ibrahim would speak many things in this message and you should listen to it references junior jackson's dream he messing messa he mentions the banks of the ohio river he mentions all of these connections about his ministry the sign he was under he mentioned about going west he talked about all the he goes into the seven thunders and he goes in a lot of these things but that's not where i'm going this morning then there's a moment of fear in his preaching the prophet stumbles on a moment of reflection and concern this is this is almost now about 30 years he would reference it that he's in this pulpit that he's been preaching he has been teaching and he screams out in this message it might be closer than you think it is and he says the word it got me scared i want you to see a prophet now who as he is now ministering reaches a point where he said it got me scared oh i haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces time is over the statement all i haven't done enough from the prophet is a shaking statement at that moment the prophet realized that there was more to be done he was speaking on a personal level so he was not at that point he's not talking about the church he's not talking about brother norman he's not talking about about about about uh but uh but a but a buzzword he doesn't want anybody else he realizes something i haven't done enough that's a realization he had had many encounters with the angel of the lord he had already ministered for many years around the world he had already been used by god for many mighty miracles and here it was the prophet is saying oh i haven't done enough i'm trying to talk to the church this morning this is one of those messages this morning with the lord's help i would like to take a title have we done enough that's the title have we done enough for my subject have you done enough and my inspiration have i done enough the question this morning is that have we heard enough because for years people have heard the message but when you watch the lives and the testimonies and the behaviors and the conduct clearly it is not just hearing i'm preaching to this church now there's a difference between hearing and doing the question and i'm challenging us this morning have we done enough have you done enough have i done enough i'm positioning that there's nobody else above it because if the prophet could admit that he did not do enough at that point in his ministry what about you what about me what about us this morning have we done enough have you done enough have i done enough but if branham said god don't make halfway preachers but a preacher could be halfway and to be halfway means a preacher is not doing enough but the man said god don't make half a christian but a christian could be halfway what he is saying is that that christian is not doing enough there's a difference between hearing and doing and that's what i want to get to is not have we heard enough not have we seen enough because we have seen enough we have heard enough for years we have heard this message we have seen what god has done have we done enough have you done enough have i done enough there's a difference between seeing and doing um challenging us this morning maybe to wake somebody up maybe to stir somebody cause when i saw this it got me scared it got me scared and i could see that the prophet now he is getting closer his ministry is expanding and his rears are realizing there's not much time left and there's so much to do and he can't afford to take chances it's not how much services you attend did i attend enough search people have attended church and backslid and went to the world and cursed this message people have sat in ministries for years and still have the audacity to ill-speak ministers ill-speak believers sat under this ministry not this church ministry the ministry of this great elijah prophet malachi 4 5 6. see in luke 17 30. revelation 10 7 sit under this so it has to go beyond hearing it has to go beyond seeing because even the prophet said what we've seen happen should put every soul into action that action is the doing part have we done enough what is the action that you are taking are we taking enough action are you taking enough action am i taking enough action it's a challenge to all of us here this morning i was seeing somebody speaking about jesus when he was ministering to his disciples and he called peter and he called him he says i will make you fishers of men fishermen a minister is supposed to be a fisherman a believer is supposed to be a fisherman i saw one time with the prophet support with how many souls he brought to christ and i sat there as i was going to say how many men have you fished because by definition if god is calling peter to be a fisherman then his success could only be measured by how many men he faced because that was a commission i call to be fishers of men i give you power to go and preach the gospel take this to every nation so failure to do that would have meant failure of what the call was anybody with me this morning have you done enough have we done enough have i done enough what we have seen happen should put every soul into action i'm sorry to disappoint you this is not one of those jump of the wall services this is one of those sirs is this the time of the end kind of message that we have to relook at what we see we look at what we do we look at how we live we look at how we act and i'm coming to your house in a minute what we have seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church i would make a revival so that's a doing part that people would fly in from europe to see that what taking place they'd say there's a place in arizona there's something broke until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the bible is being manifested there are many people who don't want to look for revival i i can't force somebody to look for a revival but you know something about have i done enough it means that that you could do and do and do and realize it's not enough that's scary yeah let me let me let me let me can i take my time a little bit the question is that have we learnt enough that's not the question the question is that have we preached enough and although these words may be doing words or action words or verbs there has to be more to it than this because of the fact that the prophet was making this statement after so many years of miracles teaching preaching that he was doing an assessment he was taking inventory more than that friends he wanted to be sure you see where i read the scripture make your calling an election sure are you sure today are you sure but i brought him in many places he said he spoke about anybody he would wrap it up he said if you were to get called right now could you answer are you sure the way you spoke to your husband this morning are you sure the way you spoke to your wife are you sure do we use death with your children are you sure do you conduct yourself in the workplace are you sure your approach to god are you sure you're approaching the ministry are you sure that you're ready you approach to the scriptures are you sure that you are ready you're approaching your prayer life are you sure that you are ready the prophet he was not taking things for granted the question of not doing raises deeper issues the question of not doing enough doing enough because he said i haven't done enough so it is not that he didn't do i want to make the point clear it is he did he was i didn't do enough in other words all my activities still haven't reached a level that could be enough no i wanted i want to drive this home friends let me take my time here to help us and to help the younger people maybe when you fail an examination it means one thing you did not do enough it's really simple and that is why it is so perplexing how children could go through five years of school and leave school without a certification because what it means is they haven't done enough and i can't take excuses because i heard somebody say recently there's a whole book on excuses but you could for every person who said they had a hard time growing up there's somebody with a harder time who made it anybody with me this morning i'm coming to your home now recently on the news somewhere i think was india or brazil or somewhere it went viral of a young boy he was studying under a street lamp because he had no electricity in his house but his determination to make it in school he would go at night and sit on the street lamp where there was light and then when you look at him successfully wants to know well well well what is your excuse i was sharing with my dad recently a lawyer passed away in our country and they were giving a recap of his life story they said he learned the alphabet at 17 years old he learnt the alphabet at 17 years old and went on to be one of the most prominent lawyers and a judge in trinidad and tobago what was the difference between him and those who went to preschool primary school if he didn't even go what was the difference it is because he had a desire to achieve something and that desire pushed him against all odds so i shared with brother recently i said it is consistent in life and god and in church it's the same thing people who are late for work late for church many times they're laid for everything because it's a discipline of behavior and god's word brings discipline are you ready have a few done enough have we done enough am i doing enough in other words so i'm bringing a type to you now because i want to be careful the objective so you understand the objective of this message i don't want to do and then find out what i did was not enough that's the problem i have anybody with me you come to church all these years by the parents read these books listen to tapes worship pre-crowd and then realize lord i come to the exam and your capac and that is why you have to move by revelation because i was thinking about it and we have esteemed teachers here when every course of study has a syllabus or curriculum or but it's even am i right there's some structure of a body of knowledge that you are supposed to acquire at the end of the journey but you know what it is it's impossible on the exam to test you on every single thing that is in the curriculum on any syllabus it's almost impossible because the exam has a time limit so you are forced as a teacher to determine what comes in the exam anybody with me so if you had this experience in school sometimes teachers will tell you well in the exam we're only going to touch on these five topics in the exam during the year you would have done 15 topics we'll be cut testing all 15 so so in general these are the areas and they give you these focus areas but that's what our prophet did also because but ibrahim preached many things but what is the exam what are we being tested on that's a deep question because people are going to church today in many churches and they don't know what's coming on the exam and they are comfortable thinking that my attendance is in the requirement for the exam is part of it but that's not the exam let me put it to you another way do i give all my money to the poor i am nothing if i don't have charity do i give my body to be burnt do i have all knowledge do i know all mysteries so it meant that the mystery and the knowledge and the body burning and give it to the poor that's wonderful but that's not the exam [Music] can i drive home this thing it brings a razor sharp focus now you could be a super student and the students who i know them in school they study everything they know the five points are coming but they know everything else too whatever you throw them they're good or not what if they're good they know everything every answer they read a book i think i shared it with the church here one time i studied so hard for combinations but a punch i don't know anybody who was yesterday they thought of me for coming entrance to this day i can't remember what yeah i do common entrance i can still remember the eclipse word for word part of my notes from my biology in common entrance because i took my notebook from common entrance and i read it and i taped it so i could listen back to the notes and the fullest part of the tip is the party would always listen to it because that part always come in first so that first part stuck in my head till this day i can't even take it out i've said it before not all plants and animals are eaten some die and fall back to the ground these dead organic substances are reduced as simple as substances the process by which this is done it's called the key decay is caused by small plants and bacteria called fungi like other living organisms bacteria and fungi need food to live they cannot get their own food like the green plants do so they get their food by attacking their plants and animals you know what years i leave school but for the life of me i can't take it out i can't undo it put me in that exam room i could still pass that exam because i did enough to ensure that it's stuck no this is the problem if you want to do what you want to do because brother branham preached many things preached about the poor peace about rome preaching about the mark of the beast and a lot of things there's a lot to do because as the prophet messenger of the age he had a responsibility to tie up all the loose ends but he also had another responsibility to prepare bride to leave this place so i have no problem with you lord in the entire curriculum there's nothing wrong with that it's wonderful we have food for days you have food every day but make sure that you pass the exam it doesn't make sense you have the knowledge and it will pass the exam make sure you make the main thing terry say make sure you keep the main thing the main thing everybody with me this morning is this helping anybody this morning this is not a deep message but it's a important one i believe have i done enough so i use the example of a school child so i said in other words the question have i done enough is the same question a student would ask before walking into an exam room but by then just as in the spiritual realm it's too late because you have no time left there's a countdown when they say exam started exams start boom the time to study is over the time to take note is over the time to ask questions is over the time to confirm your approach is over at that point you have to perform it's the same as he who is filthy filthy still he who is righteous righteous still he he's who knows what's coming in the exam and is prepared for the exam you can't change it at that point because it's already set everybody with me this morning have i done enough is the same question that should be asked by doctors would you want to be in an exam room and the doctor didn't do enough could you imagine i just finished it i still have one more course to do i still i think the examiner that course i was struggling with that course you know but here is we go try a thing here today how would you feel you might even get healed your feet might get healed at that point your feet might get over that red to say where you going he running straight or your feet make you hold this because that doctor if nobody but think about it a doctor could only speak with confidence because they know they have done enough if you meet that doctor buddy that they say what [Music] yeah this is automatically but here well i will get two types or not i'll get it and he said a gear prescription too so have i done enough is the same question that should be asked by doctors by teachers by lawyers by engineers by presidents by prime ministers this whole corona virus situation has raised to the four countries that have done enough and have not done it enough it's a real issue it's consistent through life though countries that did enough see the results of it the country did not do enough you see the results of it have i done enough is a question that should be asked and answered by husbands told her coming home but obviously i reach i reach have you done enough speaking to the husbands have you done enough is it a 40 percent is it a 50 is it a 58 is it a trial my best as a father have you done enough we're inside the house now as a mother have you done enough as a wife have you done enough because these are great responsibilities they are not accidental it is responsible yet are given to you whether you think you're ready or not and you have to step up to the task and ensure that you do enough whether you were taught or not is still required to do have i done enough as you dig deeper into these things you realize sometimes it's some sometimes the question becomes more important are the answers because many of us we don't ask the deep questions for us to change our behavior somebody said to me and i'm not feeling the anointing out of the spirit have you done enough because what will work for me may not work for you you have to know if you doing enough if this thing really mean all to you anybody with me put another way what more can you do put another way what more should you do put another way what more must you do it is real friends and on this one question hinge is rapture no rapture on this one question hinges you making it and not making it because back when the death angel was passing through the land but abandoned made it clear he said the death angel wasn't asking the question what tribe he belonged to it was have you done enough because the requirement was clear on what to do it was not even based on your identity or your identification it was not based on your tribe or your belief because the belief and the tribe should have led you into action so the test was no longer belief and tribe the test was action have you done enough take the blood and put it on the doorpost i could imagine a dead angel is passing through the land the children in the house saying daddy did we do enough that firstborn child who know that if this thing wasn't done correctly i'm the one in trouble because it's dead to the firstborn for saying daddy did we do enough are you are you sure did did we put it on the right way did we take his open did we did we get alarm without blemish did we did we did we put everything in place because i'm hearing cries coming up a road coming closer to us have we done enough daddy have you done enough have i done enough because we know what's coming think back to the days of noah god have the family in the ark they're locked in the ark but ibrahim said it daddy are you sure we did all that god asked us to do are you sure this boat is going to survive are you sure that this is what we're supposed to do have we done enough elders ministers deacons mothers have you prayed enough fathers have you prayed enough deacons have you prayed enough believers have you prayed enough have you done enough what more should you do what more must you do throughout scripture back in genesis we see abel under revelation preparing to make his sacrifice trying to make sure that everything is in place wondering have i done enough and i can see the peace that came over abel when god accepted his sacrifice it was enough cain also brought a sacrifice but it was not enough is your sacrifice enough the bible says we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord it says this is not a jump on shout service it is a shake a reality in us that the things that we fight for and think may be important may not be as important as you think the rich young ruler came to jesus see what motion what what what what else can i do to have this eternal life to enter the kingdom of god he's true so jesus said to him keep the commandments he said but i've done all that so it was not like he wasn't doing he was in a backseating condition he was doing all that he was supposed to do and then when god realized when he realized that he was really looking now to make sure he had done everything he could do this is beyond the law now this is beyond the law this is now dealing with the inner man the man on the inside that nobody could see now god could discern to him there's more that you need to do you haven't done enough can i keep bringing it home so he was perfectly legal by the letter of the law as the pastor said he did all the commandments but this wasn't a law thing anymore all right can anybody with me they were alerting his satire a desire in his heart it was a little too much that was pushing down the place of god in his heart i got to say go sell all you have and the bible said he he left sorrowful but he was still trying to get this same question answered have i done enough nicodemus hiding out secret meeting he want to make sure that this eternal life this thing i come into church all these years i believe all these years good master how can i is that how you came to church this morning you want to be sure that you make any rapture not sure you're making church a lot of people this morning there are a lot of people who will mislead your friends this is real i want to bring this home with all these shouts and singing writing songs interpreting the word divine mystery will miss the rapture because they have not done enough god is no respecter of persons he is a respecter of his examination we know it matthew 25 10 virgins but a random nail this down ten versions five wise five foolish virgin he said chased pure you can't impute sin on them and it's very simple five did enough and five didn't do enough very very simple ahmed ibrahim said that what the oil the extra oil that extra that extra that was what made the difference so when god weighed in the balance what they were presenting he said the ones with oil they can make it they're ready to go and just like the exam we talked about it was too late now to add to your knowledge to your revelation to your character to your life because the call had come exam start time to go i'm not going to be too much longer with you i want to make sure that this this thing resonates in your heart that you need to do it more but abraham would speak many times of people who would come by to be healed and he said that they didn't have enough feet so he was making a point about doing enough having enough achieving enough so they had fear to know but it was not enough i want to challenge the church this morning there are people who have a testimony but they need to do more that testimony is not enough i want to challenge you thinking a little bit i was doing some research on the olympics and the way people train for the olympics and one athlete was saying that they try to figure out what they could do that they think the competition is not doing so it's not just about doing enough to make it now they want to do extra because they want to be sure that's the same thing with the wise version because they had extra they wanted to be sure what extra now i'm pushing beyond enough now to what extra are you doing on a daily basis to bring you closer to your destination what action did you do this week i know some people think that there's a lot of mysteries and different things and ideas and things and things but did you pray every day did you talk to god every day the way he would come long and cool in the evening with adam have you done that every day because an athlete who is getting ready for a competition trains every day have you prayed every day have you read the bible every day have you forgiven every day then you haven't done enough we feel in small exams how you will pass a big one situations come to us to forgive and you're all in stuff how we expect to pass a big exam and you can't forgive god sending all these exams to you every week upset and stop allowing stuff in your life to be upset and test comment little test communication with the children the bills the house eating and small tests have you done enough so i'm not just talking about praying and reading now but it's the daily life i want to get to because that's a test listen let me make it there's no rapture to go if a husband can't show love to his wife forget rapture forget it if your wife cannot reverence the husband there's no rapture because it's a life oh you don't hear me this morning children obeying their parents that's a life more so and especially out on top of that if the community helps you lord and the and you know they want you you want one best for you i thought it's not a short job message this question is hinging on your calling and election being sure have you done enough i don't want this to go on the road of having regret now because there's nothing we can do about the past we can't change the past what we did or did not do yesterday is already finished but the question from no no no no how much more time will you pray for your children how much more time would you spend praying for the holy ghost how much more time will you pray crying out for revival how much more time would you spend tearing off the tv it's not just what you do is what what you didn't do you're following all the political news you know everything with every candidate really now in this season have you done enough have i done enough have we done enough throughout life and history we find this recurring situation of doing enough and not doing enough many people who have achieved have done so against a backdrop of major disadvantages in life because they persevered to do everything they could do to achieve what they wanted if you remember the time that brother branham gave the story of the man who who he had a colored slave or whatever and he said he wanted to get the holy ghost because he saw the arrival on his man life and he said carry me i want to get the holy ghost and he carried him and show him he said well if you want to have to come come come come and when they reach a pigsty he said that we have to go recognize that he had to wonder if he really wanted if he was willing to do enough the very spirit of this layout to see an age is they believe they have arrived they believe they have need of nothing and that spirit is in the message we have a prophet we have a message we have and people walking around not doing what they're supposed to do they believe they have done enough i want to read the scripture slowly somebody slow down and take it can we talk a little bit more and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right revelation 3 14 these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works so i know thy works is now speaking about your activities about what you're doing thou art neither cold nor hot so it's not that people not doing stuff but they're not doing it all the way that's what the bible is saying come and take it slowly i would that dog were cold or hot so then because they were lukewarm i and neither call no heart i will spew the out of my mouth how zealous are you for the gospel i'm tired of hearing people talking about how it used to be and how zealous they used to be and i'm excited and they should testify when last of you testified that i have nothing to do with the church after you if you're not testifying every day but a branham said you're going to end up back sitting that is a daily part on this we have failed friends we have not done enough well last year testified to somebody some of us 10 years ago somewhere 20 years ago somebody first come to the message and then and then what happened what's your excuse what's your excuse so then because our lukewarm what is it it's lukewarm because if you're truly passionate about something and you believe in something it'll be on your lips every day the end is here time is upon us see people love to hear this stuff about what they could get and what they will get and what they will be and what they will do but what are you doing now because to do then you have to do now to have them you must do now to live there you must do now he said only perfect love will be over there so if you do a perfect love now don't talk about over there until you fix it here fix it in your home fix it in your life this is a hard message you're preaching is not a message that that people want to run and preach have you done enough tell me yesterday what you did for the kingdom tell me what did you do yesterday for the kingdom of god and did you do all that you could do and on friday what did you do for the kingdom what did he do for your soul what did he do for your house what did he do for your life what did he do for your children for your marriage because all that is the basic family unit that god placed there in the garden of eden oh body work and the commitment and the pills that has its place too but don't compromise this thing make sure and keep the main thing the main thing friends that's why they said what shall the prophet the man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul because to lose your soul it meant he didn't do enough because you have to make your calling an election show i want to drive this home friends because the weak excuses god had taken it we saw it with moses moses city i say i can't talk and when he was done god says still going and god is showing and not accepting excuses there's no excuse for not having a prayer alive there's no excuse there's i want to say it again there is no excuse to not having a prayer life there is nothing you can present today of not having a prayer life i want to drill it to the church this morning no excuse for not reading the scriptures every day not by every day people do what they want to do make time to watch the news make time to watch your papers make time to call relatives turn the phone down and read your bible read the prophet message go and pray pray with your family talk to your husband talk to your wife call your children that's what i'm talking about that's the foundation of church wasting time gossiping foolishness have we done enough have you done enough have i done enough i'm preaching to this church i don't care what anybody else does this is sovereign i want to make it i want to be there in the rapture i want to be sure that i do all that i could do i don't want to go on here see i don't want to go on anybody else's revelation it has to be what the tapes say nothing else i don't care about nothing else give me liberty or give me death you may be seated on this same message on december the 10th 1962 but abraham said if you're unsure about something go listen back in the tape he said it clearly he says he don't say anything if you're not sure about it go back to the tape he put it on the tape for a reason have you done enough have we done enough have i done enough and seen it in a natural bit of george i'm seeing it in the spiritual people sit down in the workplace from a certain time to a certain time what's different between one employee and another employee what makes one more productive and the other productive what's the difference what are the things that separate people who are experts and professionals from those who are not and those same principles apply in the spiritual realm if you can't find time to pray what does that make you what's the difference because everybody have the same 24 hours so it's not as if japan who is praying has more time than you let me say that again is he seeing 24 hours the man who has the most responsibilities and a man with no responsibility have the same 24 hours they're people with a little small shop and they can't figure out how to run this workshop and i have somebody with 800 businesses and in the same general was running this company that company that company what what is the difference does it seem 24 hours you know what they have done they have found ways to do more with their time they have found ways to prioritize what's important but what's not they don't have time to waste they don't have time to waste and that's what this message is about the brand of spirit you say sir this is santa the end time it's later than we think so if it's later than we think it means we need to do more with the little time we have whatever we are missing we need to get it fixed now fix your attitude fix your spirit fix your tone fix your approach but i believe when you approach to god he said i'd rather you be wrong in doctrine and right in spirit than right in doctrine and wrong in spirit in the word god rates the rightness of your spirit more than your belief because if you have the right spirit he could show you things that you never saw before but having the wrong spirit nothing will open your eyes because you have an approach to things that will destroy you and if that applies in the spiritual realm so it isn't natural you could be right as the husband any house but you have your wrong spirit with it oh come on now can i can i come back home now you could be right as your wife for the hobbit have you wrong spirit how god sees it in the same way listen church the home issues have to fix the issue with parents and children have to fix between brother and sister have to fix between bridge and have to fix because these things carla survive over there the kingdom is allergic to that kind of thing can the church say man i'm not going to wait too much longer i said i read the scripture here in revelation i know thy words that was neither cold nor hot i would that would cold or hot but because though it's lukewarm i need a cold heart i will spew the out of my mouth and it goes on because i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked how many people in church right now think they have it all and have it put together and on the right track we'd have time to go into it in this service but friends if you go to the world and you look carefully at how the prophet lived and how far up we have gone from it for my life not having the quotes not having the books not having the tips but the life asking what would jesus do how would he handle this situation how would he deal with this when we hear that you couldn't tell the prophet's friends from his enemies god help us you know because we we we know and near there holy prophet would humble himself look at jesus i shared this before jesus the bible said when he went to open the scroll after coming off from being tested and he took the scripture to read the spirit of the lord is upon me the bible said it was his custom to be in the temple so it meant that from age 12 to age 30 jesus was present in every service because it was his custom to be in the temple can this sit home so it meant jesus the word made flesh sat in church for 18 years we call it the 18 years of silence and he said nothing while priests high priests junior priests aspiring priests would read the scrolls about him and he said nothing whether they were right whether they were wrong whether they were interpreting it whether they were injecting their own feelings he sat there and did nothing can we do that can we hear people lie about us and not respond can we watch people tell stuff about us that we know is not true or they get it the wrong way and not do anything about it because brother branham spoke about i say if the spirit of john dillinger is on you you'll deliver that we say we're supposed to be dead to christ that whatever people say there's no response he's a dead man he said if you get up from there and say well that's not me you're still alive i'll remember that in the message right so can have you can we reach that point where people could say stuff about us and we don't respond all that has passed have we done enough you know i'm bringing back to your memory what we know already have we done enough so that when we can stand and give an account as it were we could say lord and i read the scripture from paul i've finished my course i've run a good race i've done all he asked me to do and even the prophet felt comfort because he said when he was wandering about things he said i preach what paul preached so we are resting on that so the prophet in his ministry would reach that level of comfort that he did what he was supposed to do so when he was saying in 1962 i was it what have i done enough or haven't done enough when the prophet left he did everything he was supposed to do can the church say man because god don't take a man unless his ministry is finished where are we standing at friends i'm not going to be too much longer revelation 3 we're still there i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich so he said the people who feel they established they're not established i constantly to buy of me go try it in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raymond that thou mayest be clothed because the clothes you have on your naked and you think you have clothes and you don't know it that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear i don't know in their eyes what i say that don't may i see as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent have we done enough friends jesus fulfilled the word for his d brother branham fulfilled the word for his day every prophet fulfilled the word for their day when jesus came he was more than enough he was more than enough he did more than enough against his own will he will always be more than enough with what he did it was enough to break the power of sin forever it was enough to to not have to have to face death because now paul could say grave where is your sting the death waves in victory it was more than enough when he came he shot them out of the devil for all them years and they were moving through the satan struggling fighting up with this prophet this will work but when jesus came he brought the perfect antidote to the whole sin question that started there in genesis can the church say amen oh hallelujah when jesus came there was nothing else that needed to come because he was the fullness of what the prophet spoke about he was the fullness he was a the very mystery of god had long been made flesh the very presence of god had now been made evident come the church shame amen and when jesus was in his ministry he said my always not yet come in other words i haven't finished yet my always not here come don't touch me don't take me oh don't tell nobody about me what was he doing he knew what that line was that would be enough he was pushing back sickness he was pushing back diseases he went and took that man called that had those demons upon him legion he went to the other side to the maniac of gadara as it was he cast out those devils but he knew that was not enough oh come on now somebody say amen oh when jairo's daughter died and she came back to life he knew that was not enough he was moving towards something oh come on somebody preach back to me preach back to me the people hungry they're hungry he said what you have they say what we have is not enough oh we only have five loaves and two fishes he said bring it i'll make it more than enough i can take the little that you have and bring you to more than enough he took it he prayed for it he blessed him he said and when he started to share those five loaves and two fishes they realized what the terence that it was more than enough oh come on somebody preached back to me this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my mama you may be seated and you read a true scripture jesus bill into something and i've said before he didn't come just to heal the sick he didn't come just to raise the dead he didn't come to heal of the broken heart but when jesus was going to calvary and they thought he was about to be finished he knew he was going to hit that line that was going to make his presence enough oh come on now he knew he was honing in under something honing in into something and when they put him on the cross and he said it is finished he knew that he had done enough because when he said it is finished he meant it is enough i've done what i came here to do oh the sin question is answered when they could come for you they can't touch you anymore because to get to you they have to get through me oh hallelujah by his stripes we are now healed when the nails are in his hand and he's totally saying it is finished it was more than enough and it still didn't stop there it still didn't end there it was not finished there because when they put him in the grave he was not in the grave he dropped them to the lower reasons because he had more to do he was not satisfied with just a sin question being answered he wanted to do more than enough he went now to hell to where nobody else could have gone to do what nobody else could have done and took the keys took the keys of death took the keys of death took the keys of death so you could have life and have it more abundantly took the keys of death so that death has no power over the blood washed ones took the keys of death that death is now subject to us took the keys of death and the keys of hell oh hallelujah he unlocked those doors he unlocked those doors he unlocked those doors he unlocked all those doors all those who are there who said that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's a rock beneath the rocker he took the keys and he opened up every door and when the devil tries to put you in jail he has no keys to lock you in that jail jesus already did that he's not doing it and what he did back there is more than enough for today he doesn't have to do it again it is already done it is already finished anybody with me oh i'm now starting to preach and now starting to preach all that is just background because we are going to do enough we are not going to stay defeated we are not going to be halfway christians we are not going to be just church members just message believers i'm preaching to the sons of god to the daughters of god the sons of god who are about to be made manifest seven living voices seven thunders seven manifestations of one holy spirit one great white light that will be filled in you and in you and in you and when you don't have strength to go on and think you don't have enough his strength is made perfect in your weakness because he lives we are gonna live also because we made it we're gonna make it also have we done enough not yet but it's gonna happen it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen this and our ministry but hashem is not just the rapture our ministry is not just a wedding supper our ministry is not just a millennium our ministry is not just rain on the earth but our ministries are finished what god couldn't finish when he was here on the earth he is oh come on now somebody help me this demon this devil this lucifer this principality that was cast on our job is to finish and god knows that his bride his wife will be more than enough more than enough to take on the works of the devil more than enough oh come on now you are stronger than you realize you are built stronger than you realize the seed in your soul is more powerful than you realize the word seed in you is stronger than you realize [Applause] the devil can't stop it the demons can't stop it have we done enough we are getting their friends we are warming up we are reminding us this morning that we can do more that we can do better that we can raise above our circumstances that we can raise above depression don't let depression keep you down don't let sickness keep you down don't let your pain keep you down don't let your past keep you down raise above it we haven't done enough but we are just getting started we are just warming up we are now getting ready satan you haven't seen anything yet you have not seen anything yet there's been churches churches prides prize churches prize but there must come one with dynamics and mechanics together [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so i wanted to shake you for the first part of the service for you to realize that there's no room for laziness there's no room for setting back there's no room for a pity party there's no room for what happened yesterday there's no room for how it used to be it is going for whatever backward never the devil must see smoke smoke because you're moving so fast into your position moving so fast into your authority move i shot glory [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] maybe [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] listen jesus's first miracle didn't move the devil his first miracle didn't move the devil because the devil was used to miracles by the cliff over all the ages you know there were many signs there were many signs through the ages there were many things that took place through the ages can the church say amen but as jesus ministry began to expand and expand is that i get more and more is that i reached a critical mass that the devil's kingdoms had to go haywire he said this is becoming a little too much the conspiracy to kill jesus came in the later part of his ministry because it was becoming too much it was becoming a bit much when jesus died the devil thought enough is enough he thought it was finished but even that in the economy of god was small because he was going to reproduce himself so when jesus died in devil thinking it's over and in the upper room by the sheen and they're there for fear of what is going on around them bear in mind peter and all these jesus told peter that you will deny me you know how peter would have felt you know you know what a feeling it is bro punch after you see all that and say you're gonna before they call craig you're gonna know me peter wants to say no no way knowing peter and peter are probably saying not even anybody not me peter didn't realize you see and this is it god allows situations to come to show your vulnerability without him you see you can only know your vulnerability when situations come you know you see you don't know what you don't know you don't know what you don't know that's why you could you must never judge people because that would never happen to me now and you don't know where your vulnerability is and god to protect his kingdom will have to expose your vulnerability so that it could be protected it is not to expose your vulnerability for your embarrassment it's for your protection because you don't know what you have to defend against until it's exposed [Applause] so peter was living under the ministry of the greatest preacher that ever walked here and he had a vulnerability he didn't even know he had let me say that again under the greatest ministry that ever walked the earth brother peter didn't realize how vulnerable he was it was with disbelief he processed jesus statement that before the cockroach three times you'll deny me and he didn't believe you keep catching this sir so people who say well under this ministry or under that ministry honor that ministry under the ministry of jesus peter was still vulnerable until when he denied christ i said he wept bitterly in so much that when jesus wrote something he said go tell my disciples and peter because peter was a messed up he was in a condition after being told in matthew 16 the word peter upon this rock and peter feeling good then get him and said peter was an emotional roller coaster and here it was it's not any of the other disciples who deny christ it's brother peter only about peter this man here said you even know jesus this was not a separation from the revelation or the doctrine this was a total denial now in scripture this was because in old testament god is really big on if you deny me the consequence of denial because way back you read it there in the book of uh uh the book of joel my people shall never be ashamed and here it is peter is saying i what i'm embarrassed i'm not associated i don't know who it is so god had a special word for peter so that peter could be released from the guilt of the vulnerability he did not know he had or you don't hear me because god had to deal with it to be able to use peter more effectively than he was used before and that's why so careful you have to be because in by talking peter at that point in his life you don't know what peter was going to become similar you don't know who here is a soul that god will make a paul or jacob who god will make a israel only god has that playbook not even his prophets could see it unless god wanted him to see it so that's why the prophet himself had to be so careful when he was found himself in the in the restaurant or whatever and he looked at the woman there with his makeup and he said is this the world my daughter will live in and grew up and he said condemn her god had to come and talk to the prophet say listen let me show you about your life even as a prophet let me show you how whenever you sin how there's a blood bumper that protecting what i see about you how could he condemn this woman and the love of god dropped in his heart god was what was you he was exposing the vulnerabilities in his profit so he could close the gaps he could close the gaps he could find all the issues that he could seal it up so that this vessel could be properly sealed for service [Music] all of this was leading up and leading up so no wonder when the prophet had his test and he said he knew it was coming and the young people are making love in the church by now the devil is the devil who whipped that up because god don't order confusion he don't alter sin so god had to allow the devil to do that and what the devil does is within his confinement to do the same with job anybody with me this morning and god is now proud like job he could say look at my son branham he could deal with this test and a voice came to the prophet because god proven that he was ready for this exam he said whatever you say is what will happen say blindness say whatever is going to happen he had the power to do it because he had already been sealed up and he did what christ would do he said i forgive you i forgive you [Applause] you see how much more we have to grow how much more we have to expand our thinking and our approach to see the mind of christ have you done enough have we done enough we are building friends we are getting stronger but when the devil wants to hold things over you and this is where we want to kind of set you free now to condemn you and say well you didn't do this and he didn't do that he didn't do that this is why the word comes to open your eyes up to see that your world that you think you're in is so small what you do is break out the world that you are in into a realm because that's what spiritual measure is spiritual amnesia is a condition that you forget who you are and you are now limited like sarah by your own understanding and spiritual amnesia separates from god's understanding about you so you're there living thinking that this is my condition this is my sickness this is my trial this is my problem i'm going to break above that and tell you that you have the strength to put that under your feet it's just waiting for you to put it under your feet it's not even god to put it on the nose you put it under your feet because he said the moment the bride gets to know who she is then the rapture will go so there's this thing that's separating an awareness of who you are in god that has to be broken and the preaching of the world is a destroyed doubt the preaching of the word is to destroy unbelief that's what the preaching of the word is for so we are coming this morning against doubt against unbelief because some of you think your sickness you're gonna have it for much longer and i want to let you know that we're preaching against that doubt and unbelief to say that sickness has got to go and we are serving notice on the sickness we are serving notice on every problem we are saving notice in every situation and we are here to preach against the doubt that that will change we are saying it has to change it must change it will change because we will do enough and more than enough to change our world to change our situation to change our circumstances could you take some more i'm trying to wrap up somewhere can i all open some i don't know how this this message i'm in i think i have too much quotes but clearance if i show my notes i'm paid 16 of 123. i think i think i copied e5 twice have we done enough can we do more i want to challenge you church what more will he do this week and before i get to this week what more you'll do today what more will you do today what change will you make today you see a lot of people don't realize that success in anything spiritual and it's scriptural you know meditate on the word day and night and you have good success that's a formula do you know what happens if you live by that formula day and night mentally with day and night and you have good success so before you deal with tomorrow what are you doing today and when you could live each day saying i did my best today is there anybody could say they did their best yesterday is there anybody in this room because i did my i know i do my absolute best yesterday was incredible i did my best when i look at my efforts and i recognize i really ordered my dear said when i already spent time with you and i pray and i did my family duties and i did this i went to the grocery but when i look at the day i really find it hard i had to find a way to improve i kind it's hard to find a room for improvement i know it has to be there but it's hard any anybody that's the conversation i want you to have with yourself every day what could i improve today what can i improve what what what what what can i do better tomorrow to be a better husband back in the house again what what what what can i do tomorrow to be a better wife you know that is what christianity is about it's not always you're noting and it's not producing in your life what can you to be a better worker in a world that people could see the life of christ in me anybody with me anybody with me how can i live in my neighborhood i want people next door look and say oh you're so happy oh yeah what can you do different because if your life not showing a light of bubble that people could get attracted to then how you intend to win how you doing the fish people see you there you just depress you you you can't leave the service depression people wonder where you went and even on your job you can have a hard day energetic bible say do all they do unto the lord so when i say there is no room for executive boy i'm a boss the devil boss the devil boss that's not scripture no no that is not bible that's it whatever work you do do it unto the lord you know even if the devil using your boss your work is a sacrifice unto the lord so you have no reason leaving you stomping on your word is devil i can't wait to go to rapture because you reason you want to get raped because you want to get away from the boss i want to help your church it's the practical life because that is where brother church this is where people message you know on sundays people can come to church and they feel good about the lord and then do any week but he gives lips wasn't the prophet that when the call came for him he went outside the house and he said tell them i'm not home and god was so upset with that we call it no docking calls don't let get down into the real don't let me come down to you see a miscourt listen this thing i heard somebody say yesterday it is any simple things or christianity is tested hey i'll call you and i'm thinking well i see him scott you know very well you saw the goal now people saying well don't go there don't keep pushing don't drive down that road don't drive down the road oh hit the reverse gear fast my phone had so much cause i somehow he phoned you every year this one the phone now working because trying to avoid a miscall how would that imagine the prophet had a cell phone here was he said tell them i'm not home and god say listen that behavior can't work in them because all lies have a father have we done enough have you done enough have i done enough friends we coming down to our life i've heard somebody saying recently you know god dispatches angels scripturally to protect you but the proximity of the angels is a function of your life so the angels are protecting you you know but you see whenever you do things that not pleasing to god it creates affliction with the angels because the angels are attracted to the holiness they are they serve a holy god they attracted a holy light in you that you didn't put there that's why i said grieve not the holy spirit that word grievous is the offend the holy spirit and you offend the holy spirit with your words with your actions with you even your thoughts because the words that your thoughts are loud in heaven and your words so we are walking now into a closer walk with have i am i living really this thing this message am i the message is the message already in me it's a different question i can ask the question are you in the message is the message in you because if the message is in you it will reflect itself because we are moving towards a destination of perfection so i would expect because it's a process walk before me and be thou perfect that walk means now it's a movement it's a it's a movement towards the perfection so but i would expect whether he could have every service you come every week that passed you're getting more and more like him until one day when you look in the mirror you'll recognize vietnam i see jesus looking back so every service for us is an opportunity for us to do an assessment like the prophet did i haven't done enough so you must leave the service saying i have more to do i have more work to do i have to improve anybody who live in here saying i'm ready you recognize you're missing it come the church see him and the musician can get ready trying to wear the clothes out is this helping anybody no in our day it is expected for us to do our part it is expected of us to meet the challenge of the hour it is expected of us to be able to answer the question with a resounding yes we have done enough just like paul to timothy i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith hence four days later for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing so paul was able to reach that place just as brother branham was able to reach his own spot where he knew he did what god called him to do and friends i want to encourage you in this service if you have a revelation of what god called you to do and you should be able to look at yourself look at the word concerning you and know where you line up i'm not in a position to mark your papers you have to be in a position to look at the syllabus the curriculum at the exam and say lord i recognize i do have the holy ghost i recognize i do have patience i recognize that i answering back i recognize i've been disrespectful i recognize i've been praying and lord i've come today to really dedicate my life i continue to reboot my system my computer end up with a virus you see this coronavirus my life have a virus and i want to i want to get the antivirus in this service which is the holy ghost i want to get in the presence the atmosphere of god that i could not be more dedicated more consecrated more separated can the church see amen oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my in recognizing your day and his message you could begin to play something softly remember in my vision this is the prophet now beginning to speak and hint to the closer of his ministry begin to hint at what he had already achieved and accomplished under god he said if paul's people goes in look at the confidence so will mine hallelujah he said if paul's people went in so will mine because i'd done just exactly like he did i'm staying right with it the millions through their hands saying we are resting on that what recognize the day that we are living the time we are living the sign of the time that we are living in listen to the prophet this is now 64 now it may be later than we think one of these days let him that's outside stay outside still he that's inside must forever be inside still the door will close he said if there's some here this morning that hasn't never walked in yet oh in jesus name idea people don't look at this ignorant servant standing here speaking about himself illiterate unlearned uneducated don't look at that but look at the word that's been proven look at the great holy spirit who vindicated to be the truth we are the evening time it's later than you think women let your hair grow sister please take off them dirty clothes throw them cigarettes away for the hour will come that he that's filthy let him be filthy still and he that's righteous let him be righteous to him he that's inside his inside he's that outside it's outside that little closed margin if a righteous man will clearly be saved where will the sinner go ungodly appear where will they appear where will they appear friends as we look through the ages i'm closing out we had luther and luther brought a message of justification and then when wesley came the message that luther had was no longer enough it could no longer make the cut because the season had changed and if you had stayed in that day just like acts 19 he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe he said we where we are nobody's think all the holy ghost he said unto what we are baptized under john's baptism so those there were still living in the old age so so to speak and the same way that when wesley came it meant what luther brought was long enough and when the pentecostals came it meant that what wesley brought was no longer enough i remember the brahmana came it meant what the pentecostal had was no longer enough but now in this age this message is more than enough because it pulls up from all the ages and the prophet can scream on behold the bridegroom comment go out and meet him in other words you have everything available to you to get ready will you be ready will you be ready have you done enough to be ready was the cry that went out the call the call the call to leave the quarter [Music] but before that time of going friends this is the call before that call the call to rededicate your life the call to make things right the call to leave all your burdens your
