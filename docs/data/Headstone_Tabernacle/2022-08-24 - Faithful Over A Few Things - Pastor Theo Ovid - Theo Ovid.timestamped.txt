[36:04] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[36:07] traveling into a far country
[36:10] who call it call his own servants
[36:13] and deliver unto them his goods
[36:15] unto one
[36:17] you give five talents
[36:19] to another two
[36:20] to another one
[36:22] to every man according to his several
[36:24] ability and straightway took his journey
[36:28] then he that received the five talents
[36:31] went
[36:32] and traded with the same and made them
[36:35] other five talents
[36:37] likewise he that had received two he
[36:40] also gained other two
[36:42] but he that had received one
[36:45] went
[36:46] and digged in the earth and hid the
[36:48] lord's money
[36:49] after a long time
[36:51] the lord of those servants commit
[36:54] and recognize
[36:55] reconnect with them
[36:58] so he that had received five talents
[37:00] came
[37:01] and brought other five talents saying
[37:03] lord thou deliver unto me five talents
[37:06] behold i have gained besides them five
[37:09] talents more
[37:10] his lord said unto him well done no good
[37:13] and faithful servant
[37:15] though has been faithful over a few
[37:18] things
[37:19] i will make the ruler over many things
[37:22] entered out into the joy of thy lord
[37:25] he also that had received two talents
[37:28] came and said lord dog delivers unto me
[37:31] two talents behold i have gained two
[37:34] other talents besides them
[37:36] his lord said unto him well done good
[37:39] and faithful servant thou has been
[37:41] faithful over a few things i will make
[37:43] the ruler over many things enter into
[37:46] the joy
[37:47] of thy lord
[37:49] then he which had received one talent
[37:51] came and said lord
[37:54] i knew thee a dawah at a hard man
[37:57] reaping where thou has not shown
[38:00] gathering where thou has destroyed and i
[38:03] was afraid
[38:04] and i went and hid thy talent
[38:06] in the earth lou
[38:08] their daughter started dying
[38:11] his lord answered and said unto him
[38:13] though wicked and slutful servant
[38:16] thou is that i reap where i sowed not
[38:19] and gathered away i have not struggled
[38:22] though orders therefore to have put my
[38:23] money to the exchanges
[38:26] and then at my coming i should have
[38:28] received mine own
[38:30] with usury or interest
[38:32] take therefore the talent from him and
[38:34] give it
[38:35] unto him which had ten talents
[38:39] for every
[38:40] for under every one that act
[38:43] shall be given
[38:44] and he shall have abundance
[38:46] but from him that had not
[38:48] shall be taken away even
[38:51] that which he had
[38:52] and cast
[38:54] ye
[38:55] the unprofitable servant into outer
[38:57] darkness
[38:58] there shall be weeping
[39:00] a nation of deep may god bless this
[39:02] world you may be seated
[39:03] oh praise the lord
[39:06] my we appreciate the service on sunday
[39:08] but isaac
[39:10] deliverance and restoration of your
[39:12] spiritual identity
[39:14] and uh
[39:15] he identified jacob wrestling
[39:18] and jacob knew he was a trickster he was
[39:21] a trickster you know and a guy could do
[39:23] all kind of stuff
[39:25] um to get by
[39:26] but when he wanted to go further he had
[39:29] was to get a change
[39:30] and that change means wrestling
[39:33] and um
[39:34] he he he got delivered
[39:37] and he raspberry angel
[39:39] and his name couldn't be the same
[39:41] because something happened with him
[39:43] and god changed his name from jacob to
[39:45] israel and that is where you get the
[39:47] tribe of the israel about birthday
[39:50] isn't that right the twelve tribes of
[39:51] israel
[39:53] so
[39:54] what i want to say is this
[39:55] if jacob didn't wrestle with the angel
[39:57] he couldn't get a name change
[39:59] and to wrestle with the angel it means
[40:01] that he had to mean business
[40:03] praise the lord he had to mean business
[40:04] isn't that right
[40:06] last wednesday night we spoke about sell
[40:08] all by that field
[40:10] and that was taken and jesus was
[40:13] dropping some parables again the kingdom
[40:15] of heaven they saw matthew 13 44 just to
[40:17] recap a little bit just to connect with
[40:19] this service tonight again the kingdom
[40:20] of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden
[40:22] a field which when a man had found it he
[40:25] hide it and for joy thereof go it
[40:27] instead of all that he had and buy it
[40:29] that feel again the kingdom of heaven is
[40:32] like a merchant seeking goodly pearls
[40:34] who when he had found one pool of great
[40:37] price went and sold all that he had and
[40:39] bought it so the key deal is when you
[40:42] see the value of this treasure hid in
[40:45] the field then you will know it is with
[40:48] all it is worth everything
[40:50] if if it's a gospel and his word all and
[40:52] there's a treasure sink into it
[40:55] throw your all into it
[40:57] oh praise the name of the lord amen
[40:59] praise god
[41:01] so tonight
[41:02] i have a title and the title is
[41:06] faithful over a few things
[41:10] faithful over a few things i have an
[41:12] inspiration as a question like last week
[41:14] and have would god trust you with more
[41:18] what god trusts you
[41:21] with more
[41:22] now
[41:23] the the thing of it is
[41:25] jesus was about to leave
[41:28] and the disciples asked him a question
[41:31] and the question was i think i'm going
[41:33] to get into it uh this is what matthew
[41:35] 24. now we read my 25 the magic 24 it
[41:38] says as he sat in the mount of olives
[41:41] the disciples came unto him privately
[41:43] saying tell us when shall these things
[41:45] be
[41:46] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[41:49] of the end of the world
[41:50] and jesus answers them to them take heed
[41:52] that no man deceive you number one
[41:55] don't let them deceive their deceive you
[41:56] because their spirit reception upon them
[41:58] guys for many shall come in my name
[42:00] saying i'm christ shall deceive many you
[42:03] you shall hear of wars rumors of wars
[42:06] see there should be no trouble for all
[42:07] these things must come to pass but the
[42:09] end is not yet no
[42:11] jesus was a master teacher
[42:14] so jesus begin to bring parables
[42:17] and these parables unlike the one we
[42:19] read last week
[42:20] which was discovering
[42:23] put god first the kingdom first
[42:25] discovering the treasure hidden in the
[42:27] field
[42:28] the next two parables that is in matthew
[42:30] chapter 25 is actually pertaining to his
[42:33] coming
[42:34] the first parable is the parable of the
[42:36] wise version and the foolish virgins you
[42:38] would hear him say the kingdom of heaven
[42:40] is like unto
[42:42] let me just get in there quickly i want
[42:44] to read it uh the exact wording of it
[42:47] praise the name of the lord matthew
[42:50] chapter 25
[42:51] let's just take a look at that
[42:55] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[42:57] likened unto ten virgins which took
[42:58] their lamps and went forward to meet the
[43:00] bridegroom five of them were wise five
[43:02] are foolish they that were foolish took
[43:05] their lambs took no oil with them but
[43:07] the wise took oil in their vessels with
[43:10] their lamps this is people
[43:13] this is dealing with the coming of the
[43:14] lord
[43:15] okay
[43:16] while the and the wise took oil in their
[43:18] vessels with their lamps
[43:20] while the bagoon carried
[43:23] they all slumbered and slipped
[43:25] and at midnight there was a crime made
[43:28] behold the bridegroom cometh go you
[43:30] ought to meet him then all those
[43:32] versions of rose and trim the lamps and
[43:34] the fool is said onto the whites give us
[43:37] of your oil for our lambs are gone out
[43:39] or going out and the wise answer say not
[43:41] so at least there be not enough for us
[43:43] and for you but go you rather to them
[43:46] that sell and buy for yourselves
[43:49] now while they went to buy
[43:52] here comes the bridegroom the bridegroom
[43:54] came and they that were ready went in
[43:57] with him to the marriage and the doors
[43:59] were shut
[44:00] afterwards came also the other virgins
[44:02] saying lord lord open the earth he
[44:05] answered and said to them i say unto you
[44:07] i know you're not
[44:08] watch therefore for you know
[44:11] neither the day nor the or when the son
[44:14] of man commit
[44:15] and then he brought this second parable
[44:18] and this second parable is what we're
[44:20] going to look at tonight
[44:22] for the kingdom of heaven is the man
[44:24] traveling until far country
[44:27] he's going for a fire journey and he
[44:29] gave his servants
[44:30] stuff to deal with isn't that something
[44:32] else
[44:33] oh praise the name of the lord okay so
[44:36] let's just drop our background i'll be
[44:37] gonna get into it
[44:39] all right here
[44:41] but
[44:46] lot wanted the world and god taught his
[44:49] world and separated abram and lord
[44:52] lord
[44:53] being a type of a carnal believer who
[44:56] didn't think these things were true he
[44:58] just went down into sudden he didn't
[45:01] have the real spunk to stand out as we
[45:03] call it and call right right and wrong
[45:06] wrong
[45:07] now all these believers as we could go
[45:09] on for ours
[45:11] all these
[45:12] will like a bunch of change out of your
[45:15] pocket
[45:16] in god's hands you pull out a bunch of
[45:19] chains they are pennies
[45:20] they are nickels but they are dimes
[45:24] they are quarters they are half dollars
[45:25] they are dollar all in coins
[45:28] now that's what the will is
[45:30] in god's hand
[45:31] there are some people that can just have
[45:33] a pennies worth of it
[45:35] and god can only use them in a penny way
[45:39] that is all
[45:41] they can buy
[45:43] don't reject them
[45:44] if they can't believe the real truth
[45:47] don't turn them down
[45:50] don't kick them out and say they're not
[45:52] in it because
[45:54] god uses pennies sometimes
[45:57] lot was a penny
[45:59] abram was a silver dollar
[46:01] so we take a hundred lots to make our
[46:03] abraham
[46:04] a hundred carnal believers will never
[46:08] stand in the presence of a genuine
[46:10] christian
[46:11] that is separated from the carnal things
[46:13] of the world living in christ jesus
[46:15] so you're seeing that the believers is
[46:18] like a bunch of change
[46:19] in god's hand some could buy a pennies
[46:22] wood some could buy a nickel's wood some
[46:24] could buy half a dollar wood some could
[46:26] buy a dollar wood all have different
[46:28] values are we getting somewhere with
[46:30] this okay
[46:31] now
[46:33] people lay on their faces some men come
[46:35] to me i believe i seen one of the boys
[46:37] back there in the building i met this
[46:39] boy coming and received the holy spirit
[46:41] from up and then boys come to me and say
[46:43] no brother branham no how now that we
[46:45] have been saved and received the holy
[46:46] schools shall we go seeking gifts i said
[46:49] don't do it
[46:50] don't do it
[46:52] god gives his gift sovereignly
[46:55] gifts and callings are without
[46:57] repentance the first thing you know you
[46:59] go to seeking something god you just
[47:01] make me a preacher you just do this and
[47:03] to me and what you're going to be a big
[47:05] stuff should
[47:06] you will go to someone's theology some
[47:08] organization and there you'll be a
[47:10] pillar yourself and conquer let god do
[47:12] the calling
[47:14] god will call you god will sanctify you
[47:17] god will give you what he has need to
[47:19] give you
[47:21] yes sir we'll give the lord some praises
[47:24] amen
[47:25] so all that you need of god put inside
[47:27] of you
[47:28] because gifts and calling are world
[47:30] repentance isn't that right are you
[47:31] ready tonight
[47:32] here we go you can't bargain for grace
[47:36] you can't be it can't be sold
[47:38] you can't bargain for it no it can't be
[47:41] bought it can't be traded for
[47:44] praise god you can't tell god don't save
[47:46] this one don't deliver this one don't
[47:48] bless this one it's by grace we are
[47:51] saved through faith not of works praise
[47:54] god we can boast in ourselves there is
[47:56] nothing good we could do to deserve god
[47:59] grace god graces because he has that
[48:02] and he could release that
[48:04] oh glory to god it's got grace here to
[48:06] you tonight
[48:07] praise god not because if you're good or
[48:09] you're bad or whatever it is but it's
[48:11] just god's grace to you or give the lord
[48:13] some praises that's why you should
[48:14] praise him tonight
[48:16] you can't bag him for grace you it can't
[48:18] be sold it can be bagging for it can't
[48:21] be traded for you say well now lord i
[48:23] will go and join this great big baptist
[48:25] church or methodist church and
[48:26] pentecostal church i will do this and if
[48:29] you will do this for me it can't be back
[48:31] in
[48:31] all that the father had given me will
[48:34] come to me and no man can come except
[48:37] my father calls him first
[48:39] you just become a church member of that
[48:41] big church
[48:42] you won't be saved our talents
[48:45] cannot listen here we see our talents
[48:47] that we have we cannot earn grace by
[48:50] talents
[48:51] whether by singing talent preaching
[48:53] talent digging talent elder talent
[48:55] whatever talent we have we cannot earn
[48:58] grace because we have a gift
[49:00] the gift doesn't earn your grace grace
[49:03] stands on its own gift or no gift talent
[49:06] or no talent or give the lord some
[49:08] praises tonight
[49:10] some people are going free
[49:11] if god made me a preacher listen to
[49:14] these words
[49:15] that don't show his grace has been with
[49:18] me
[49:19] no no no it says grace alone that saves
[49:21] me it has nothing to do with preaching
[49:24] the gospel okay this is enough we can
[49:26] close off right here
[49:28] run around the building and shout and
[49:29] praise god and dance it has nothing to
[49:32] do gifts have nothing to do
[49:34] grace is on his own
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:38] not because i preach the gospel i am
[49:43] that's a saved one
[49:45] not because you speak in tongues you are
[49:47] saved no not because you preach you are
[49:50] not even saved just because you preach
[49:53] you are not saying because you speak in
[49:55] tongues you're not saved because you do
[49:56] any of these things first corinthians 13
[49:58] prove so do i speak with the tongue of
[50:00] men and angels do i understand all
[50:02] mysteries of god a preacher do i do all
[50:04] of this and have faith with mountains i
[50:07] am nothing until charity comes in which
[50:09] is love and love is grace the grace of
[50:12] god that does it all
[50:14] oh glory to god i am nothing until i
[50:17] have charity which is love
[50:19] love is grace
[50:22] glory to god that's what we say when the
[50:24] sun shining and rain falling the rain
[50:26] will say i'm falling on the tomato tree
[50:27] but nothing in marijuana tree
[50:29] the rain is just fall
[50:31] so marijuana going
[50:33] pumpkin growing everything growing
[50:35] because grace is that that's what god is
[50:38] the sun shining the good and the bad oh
[50:40] hallelujah the blessing fallen all or
[50:43] give the lord praises praise god and god
[50:45] wants you to be like him you bless
[50:47] people whether they're bad whatever good
[50:49] whatever it is you still treat them
[50:51] right could somebody say amen oh glory
[50:54] to god hallelujah some people
[50:57] you have talents like these rock and
[50:59] roll kings that makes me sick i don't
[51:01] know he said okay i'll just keep that
[51:03] there
[51:04] he said no all right okay god's grace
[51:08] cannot be bagging for
[51:11] it cannot be talented into
[51:14] it is sovereign grace
[51:17] nothing in my arms i bring
[51:19] simply to thy cross i clean
[51:22] naked wounded just as i am without one
[51:25] plea but thy blood was shed for me and
[51:28] that thou bissed me come to thee o lamb
[51:30] of god i come it is grace grace
[51:34] wonderful
[51:35] marvelous
[51:36] amazing grace i feel the anointing
[51:39] sweeping in on that
[51:41] it's the grace of god tonight not
[51:43] because i've never committed reality i
[51:44] never fornicate i never lie i never
[51:46] achieved no it's still the grace of god
[51:48] praise god you don't like that man out
[51:49] there he said i'm not like that sinner
[51:51] oh dear i'm not i never did i never did
[51:53] i come to church i miss a service i pay
[51:55] my tithe and do all of that and that
[51:57] sinner out there they said lord have
[51:58] mercy upon me and jesus said that man
[52:00] outside more righteous than the man on
[52:02] the inside it's the grace of god oh give
[52:04] the lord some praises he didn't have to
[52:07] do it but he did that's why i could
[52:09] shout i could dance and praise god it's
[52:11] the grace of god that save us it's the
[52:13] grace of god and open my eyes it's the
[52:15] grace of god anointed since he behold i
[52:17] send you elijah the prophet malachi 4
[52:19] message is the grace of god to show us
[52:21] we are not chickens we are eagles oh
[52:23] glory we are not methodist baptist
[52:25] pentecostals we are sons and daughters
[52:27] of the living god is the grace of god
[52:29] unfold the mysteries to us jesus told
[52:31] his own disciples unto you as given to
[52:33] know the mysteries of the kingdom oh
[52:35] glory to god that's why you speak in
[52:36] parables because in the parables of
[52:38] hidden things that you could see tonight
[52:40] that will benefit you
[52:42] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[52:45] are you with me tonight
[52:48] now this particular parable of jesus
[52:52] is a very significant and powerful
[52:54] parable
[52:56] and to me this parable brings a balance
[53:00] a balance with this modern christian
[53:02] world that feel and this generation and
[53:04] bunch of people that feel they are
[53:05] entitled
[53:07] just like the people in the message now
[53:08] think that entitled being the rapture
[53:10] because
[53:11] it all your love love you one thing
[53:12] you'll be with you and they're sitting
[53:14] on that and they're cooling yourself on
[53:15] the church bench
[53:16] that is not what is taught
[53:18] to go in the rapture you have to have
[53:20] rapture in faith
[53:23] to make the rapture you can't be
[53:25] thoughtful
[53:26] and peter gave a formula
[53:28] by using his words giving all diligence
[53:31] add
[53:33] to your faith virtue
[53:34] and the virtual knowledge and the
[53:35] knowledge temperance and the temperance
[53:37] patience and the patience godliness and
[53:38] put bronica and probably cancer and on
[53:43] which is the bond of perfectness which
[53:45] is charity which is the love which is
[53:46] the thing that cannot fail
[53:52] but peter gave the key by say giving all
[53:56] you use a word called diligence
[53:58] so this parable is very important it's a
[54:01] powerful parable
[54:03] because this parable shows
[54:06] how
[54:07] we have to manage
[54:09] what god give us
[54:11] while waiting for him to come
[54:15] are you with me
[54:16] this is identifying
[54:19] how
[54:20] we have to manage
[54:22] by waiting for him to come
[54:25] the question was asked if the lord
[54:26] coming next week should i continue
[54:28] planting the crops what was the answer
[54:30] that yes
[54:31] somebody go eat from it
[54:33] you don't sit down on a bench to say
[54:35] are wasting you coming lord are you
[54:37] doing nothing
[54:38] no you're not in the spirit
[54:40] the lord coming for you
[54:42] because this is the example of how you
[54:45] have to be prepared for him coming
[54:48] because in him coming you have to give
[54:49] an account
[54:51] of what has been allotted to you
[54:53] what has been given to you
[54:55] everybody getting something
[54:57] to work with oh give the lord some
[54:59] praises
[55:00] i want to hear a shout in the house
[55:03] everyone on earth getting something to
[55:06] work with
[55:07] to be ready when it comes
[55:10] hallelujah
[55:12] so the first servant he got five let's
[55:15] call it five thousand dollars or five
[55:16] million dollars the second one get two
[55:18] million and the other one get one
[55:19] million
[55:21] all right
[55:22] so god want
[55:24] and this parable goes beyond money and
[55:26] finance
[55:27] because this brings the question of
[55:28] accountability and this brings the
[55:30] question
[55:31] your own ability that god sees
[55:34] and if you notice he is not expecting a
[55:37] man with one to make
[55:38] what the 5000 man make
[55:41] because the bible speaks he gave
[55:43] everyone according to the ability
[55:45] so that master had resentment
[55:49] that master don't give him more than you
[55:50] can bear
[55:52] or more than you could be handled but we
[55:54] know if you'll be faithful and little
[55:56] you'll be faithful and much
[55:58] he wants to see your faithfulness
[56:00] because when you present what he
[56:01] presented them he said you are being a
[56:03] faithful in few things
[56:05] i could give you a ruler to be faithful
[56:07] over much
[56:08] over many things because i give you
[56:09] something a few things to manage to see
[56:12] how you will handle it to see how you
[56:14] will deal with it are you with me
[56:16] tonight
[56:17] trust god help us tonight
[56:20] so god wants some returns
[56:23] on his investment
[56:25] of your life
[56:26] of you
[56:28] so watch
[56:30] who
[56:31] [Music]
[56:32] praise god
[56:34] so he wasn't condemned this this this
[56:36] brother
[56:38] who buried
[56:39] what the master gave him
[56:41] i don't want to see the talent as a gift
[56:43] like a gift is saying oh i don't want to
[56:45] see it as that we could also type that
[56:47] but i want you to see it as what god
[56:48] give him to to manage
[56:51] and
[56:52] he wasn't condemned
[56:54] because he didn't get as much as
[56:57] say god
[56:58] how come you get five
[57:00] oh can we get one again a fight
[57:03] don't get fight for that you know
[57:05] because what god gives you
[57:07] is for you to deal with it
[57:10] so you take them so there's no need to
[57:11] be jealous or envious because watch it
[57:13] forget the two only five
[57:16] both of them produce a hundred percent
[57:18] five brought another five the two
[57:20] thousand man brought another two
[57:22] the one bear rated
[57:24] and to show you the master was on point
[57:27] he said for be a minimum you're going to
[57:29] put it in the bank
[57:30] and at least it will get some interest
[57:31] in it
[57:34] but you can't tell me your buried and
[57:36] then you say lord just what you give me
[57:38] is just for the hand in your back
[57:42] so you mean god wants returns
[57:45] yes he does
[57:47] he call him he call that brother an
[57:50] unprofitable servant don't call him
[57:52] unbeliever no because he need message
[58:04] unprofitable
[58:07] so matthew 25 jesus gave two parables
[58:10] pertaining to his second coming
[58:12] and then a statement that he ending
[58:14] separate sheep from goats the first one
[58:16] was the five wise virgins five foolish
[58:18] second one is about the talents
[58:20] about the faithful and unfaithful
[58:22] servant okay so the second parable deals
[58:25] with servants and stewardship
[58:28] with which have been assigned to them
[58:30] and accountability
[58:32] it can also be viewed as individuals i
[58:34] want to reflect over the scripture we
[58:36] read are we going to glean something
[58:37] from it tonight
[58:39] all right so part like a bible lesson
[58:41] but i trust that you'll be edified
[58:42] tonight because when i keep thinking
[58:44] about it and i keep going it over it was
[58:47] kind of shaken to me
[58:48] and you'll see why
[58:50] for the kingdom of heaven is the man
[58:52] traveling the fact country who call his
[58:54] servants and deliver unto him his goods
[58:57] under one he gave five talents another
[58:59] two to another one to every man
[59:00] according to several bill watch until
[59:03] every man according to his several
[59:06] ability
[59:07] let's stop right there
[59:09] so god give each one of us ability
[59:12] so you can put inside of the ability
[59:14] everyone have it
[59:15] several ability
[59:17] hallelujah
[59:19] by this element he could give one five
[59:21] two and one
[59:22] but each one has ability
[59:25] it's not like somebody's a monkey and
[59:26] somebody's a human
[59:28] everybody has the ability
[59:30] and god didn't give them too much to
[59:32] manage he gave them enough
[59:34] that they could manage it that they
[59:36] could handle it all right
[59:38] so likewise he that received two gained
[59:40] two he had traded five got five and he
[59:43] received one went down digging the earth
[59:45] and hid his lord's money after a long
[59:48] time
[59:50] hallelujah sometimes we will deal with
[59:52] the lord delay is coming
[59:54] what people are saying okay but after a
[59:56] long time so this is jesus talking about
[59:58] his second coming okay watch what
[1:00:01] happened here now
[1:00:02] and then now
[1:00:04] look after a long time
[1:00:06] uh the the servant of the lord comment
[1:00:08] and reckon it with them which is to give
[1:00:10] an account let me hear what you do with
[1:00:11] my business
[1:00:13] let me see what you do in the shop the
[1:00:14] store what you what you do with what i
[1:00:16] give you let me see so the one with five
[1:00:18] come and say lord you give me five like
[1:00:20] five more
[1:00:21] so i can say
[1:00:24] so god
[1:00:25] so when you look at this carefully then
[1:00:28] god's program is about increase
[1:00:32] is about profitability
[1:00:34] god have no time with waste and time
[1:00:36] because god does waste time the bible
[1:00:38] said he rested after he labored
[1:00:42] the first day the second day the third
[1:00:44] day he's doing creation and afterwards
[1:00:46] he rested from his works so god himself
[1:00:48] does labor even in his mind he was going
[1:00:51] forth labor when he was bringing forth
[1:00:53] us
[1:00:55] glory the god elohim laboring bringing
[1:00:58] forth us
[1:00:59] in his thinking
[1:01:00] glory doesn't when man fell he said by
[1:01:02] the sweat of thy proud labor
[1:01:05] oh glory to god you have to work
[1:01:07] oh blessed be the name of the lord if
[1:01:10] jacob wanted to change he had to work
[1:01:13] he had to wrestle with the angel and
[1:01:15] when he said let me go he said not yet
[1:01:17] until you change me i ain't letting you
[1:01:18] go you have to work you have to earn the
[1:01:21] right to be changed oh cliff the lord
[1:01:23] has shout in the house
[1:01:25] oh glory to god praise god this killing
[1:01:28] all them dead ducks in the messengers
[1:01:30] sitting down waiting for just something
[1:01:31] to just happen to them
[1:01:34] without pressing without fighting
[1:01:35] without
[1:01:36] battling amen
[1:01:39] all right let me just go forward you
[1:01:41] know
[1:01:42] outer darkness
[1:01:44] the unprofitable servant
[1:01:46] oh my my my mind
[1:01:49] all right let's go
[1:01:52] faithful and little
[1:01:54] faithful and much
[1:01:56] god
[1:01:57] and he said this if we could only get
[1:01:59] started
[1:02:01] god will do the rest
[1:02:02] so he's looking for us to get started
[1:02:05] yeah we talk about waiting upon god but
[1:02:07] the scriptures say he's greater than us
[1:02:10] adoption time when god can upon his
[1:02:11] fullness he's also waiting on us to get
[1:02:14] down to jordan he's written on us that
[1:02:16] we could buy the whole field he's still
[1:02:17] waiting on us that we control in or
[1:02:20] everything and become prisoners to the
[1:02:22] lord jesus isn't that right
[1:02:24] but i'm saying let me say something too
[1:02:26] united time we see the churches united
[1:02:28] nations enlightened it's united time of
[1:02:30] god and it's bright too and i say this
[1:02:32] with reverence and respect i believe the
[1:02:34] bride of christ is called i believe she
[1:02:36] is sealed in the kingdom of god i
[1:02:38] believe the mechanics is here they are
[1:02:40] waiting for dynamics to take over the
[1:02:41] earth so all this is prophecy seen this
[1:02:43] in vision abolition is called i believe
[1:02:46] she is seated in the kingdom of god we
[1:02:48] aim some of his ain't born yet but he's
[1:02:50] seen it
[1:02:51] called
[1:02:52] sealed i believe the mechanics is here
[1:02:55] they're waiting for dynamics prophecy
[1:02:56] hanging over you they're waiting for
[1:02:58] dynamics that will take her off the
[1:02:59] earth into glory in the rapture i
[1:03:01] believe it with all my heart we know we
[1:03:04] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:03:06] he shall do it
[1:03:08] he is the dynamics
[1:03:10] so the dynamic is a person who gives the
[1:03:12] lord some praises he is the dynamics oh
[1:03:16] glory to god the dynamics is not a thing
[1:03:18] it's he is the dynamics watch this we
[1:03:22] just become members of the machine of
[1:03:24] the body
[1:03:26] forming ourselves into his image
[1:03:29] as we see him uniting himself with us in
[1:03:32] his works with his love gifts as he
[1:03:34] hands them to us just before the wedding
[1:03:37] supper and we are waiting and watching
[1:03:39] for that
[1:03:40] then he put the anchor down the dynamics
[1:03:43] of this church will be a refilling of
[1:03:46] the holy spirit
[1:03:47] which is acts 4
[1:03:49] praise god acts 2 was the holy spirit on
[1:03:52] the day of pentecost acts 2 wasn't mary
[1:03:54] saying be it done unto me according to
[1:03:56] thy word that was next to
[1:03:58] acts 2 was they were filled with the
[1:04:00] holy ghost
[1:04:02] he said well not even confidence are
[1:04:03] going to come to you isn't that right or
[1:04:05] when the holy ghost came
[1:04:07] inside of them they had god inside of
[1:04:09] them first was called above us pillar of
[1:04:11] fire god with us in jesus christ now god
[1:04:13] came in them in man oh glory to god on
[1:04:17] the day of pentecost and man was changed
[1:04:19] forever we're going back to eden we're
[1:04:22] going back to the original we're going
[1:04:24] back to where we came from
[1:04:28] oh glory to god amen
[1:04:30] so let's nail this down now the dynamics
[1:04:33] of this church
[1:04:34] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[1:04:36] is an old man bigger no mysteries after
[1:04:39] all the mysteries come forth the
[1:04:41] dynamics is still a refilling of the
[1:04:43] holy spirit oh glory with the same
[1:04:45] sensation with the same emotions with
[1:04:48] the same fire with the same staggering
[1:04:50] with the same power praise god let them
[1:04:52] figure that all out
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:58] the one without sensation feeling real
[1:04:59] nice
[1:05:00] something right nice
[1:05:02] you see here
[1:05:03] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:05:06] refilling of the holy spirit
[1:05:08] and this is the path i want to get to
[1:05:10] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:05:14] what
[1:05:16] worked in a small measure
[1:05:18] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:05:21] unite with the body
[1:05:23] but when the head and the body unites
[1:05:25] together the full power
[1:05:27] full power
[1:05:28] you can't get the full power yet until
[1:05:31] the head and the body unite together so
[1:05:33] the power before that had to be a small
[1:05:35] measure that we could work with or give
[1:05:38] the lord a shout you see oh suddenly we
[1:05:40] had a prayer line we working with a
[1:05:41] small measure to do that because they
[1:05:43] come out with a dynamic strike yeah no
[1:05:46] prayer line you know praise god eyes
[1:05:48] open up death hear dumb speak devil get
[1:05:51] out
[1:05:52] oh give the lord i shall walk
[1:05:54] just a word going forward with power
[1:05:57] because god could be there the lord
[1:05:59] himself went everywhere with them
[1:06:01] confirming it would resign follow it the
[1:06:03] same pillar of fire that was with the
[1:06:05] early church going to be in the last
[1:06:06] church do you believe that
[1:06:08] he said if he is big enough to keep it
[1:06:10] and bring it to pass
[1:06:15] oh glory
[1:06:17] hallelujah
[1:06:18] god cannot lie
[1:06:21] hallelujah
[1:06:22] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:06:24] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:06:26] have worked in a small measure while the
[1:06:30] headstone is coming down it's hallelujah
[1:06:32] we have a measure to work with while the
[1:06:35] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:06:38] the body and when that head and body
[1:06:40] unites together the full power
[1:06:43] the full power of the holy ghost would
[1:06:45] raise up just exactly like that even the
[1:06:48] dead that is dead in christ for hundreds
[1:06:50] of years will rise in the beauty of his
[1:06:53] holiness and take their flights to the
[1:06:55] sky the dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:06:58] oh we need that
[1:07:00] we need that
[1:07:02] that dynamics which is the holy spirit
[1:07:05] and we are promised it i'm glad i'm so
[1:07:07] glad that god made that promise no man i
[1:07:09] make that promise and i wouldn't let no
[1:07:11] man take that promise away from me every
[1:07:13] man would is a liar but this what we
[1:07:15] preaching here tonight this is true
[1:07:17] because god said it man channeling my
[1:07:19] bread alone but every word i proceed out
[1:07:22] of the mouth of the prophets and gosh in
[1:07:24] our prophet in the last days just tell
[1:07:26] us how we gonna leave here it will take
[1:07:28] dynamics and the dynamics of the holy
[1:07:30] spirit oh gloria and he is the dynamics
[1:07:33] he is the big magnet and we all get
[1:07:35] magnetized to the headstone so when that
[1:07:37] magnet come down and you are magnetized
[1:07:39] to the headstone going to pick you up
[1:07:41] and you're going in the rapture oh give
[1:07:43] the lord some praises tonight
[1:07:45] oh hallelujah the dynamics is the holy
[1:07:48] spirit oh glory
[1:07:51] hallelujah
[1:07:52] hallelujah
[1:07:54] this is
[1:07:55] to the night we'll be along with you
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:59] definition of faithful faithful is to be
[1:08:01] steadfast in affection or allegiance
[1:08:04] film in adherence to promises or in
[1:08:07] observance of duty given with strong
[1:08:10] assurance
[1:08:11] true to the facts and to the standards
[1:08:14] faithfulness
[1:08:16] is the quality
[1:08:17] of being faithful
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:21] now
[1:08:24] it's so
[1:08:25] it's so strange
[1:08:27] that brother with the one talent
[1:08:30] he
[1:08:31] didn't expect that response you know
[1:08:34] no
[1:08:35] he
[1:08:36] felt comfortable
[1:08:38] to say lord who will you give me i have
[1:08:41] a back to give you you lose nothing
[1:08:44] so what's that tell you from this
[1:08:46] parable
[1:08:47] that making a profit have to do with
[1:08:50] risk in other words he played safe
[1:08:54] the bible didn't tell
[1:08:56] all what he did when he buried it you
[1:08:58] know
[1:08:59] because when he buried it
[1:09:01] he'd want to do nothing
[1:09:03] he'd go by the bar he could chill you
[1:09:05] can relax yourself because
[1:09:07] what you give me is what they get
[1:09:11] but if you notice in the scriptures
[1:09:14] let me see what he said
[1:09:28] i think there's another
[1:09:30] i wonder if it's the amplified let me
[1:09:31] just get this in the amplifier let's see
[1:09:32] what they say here could you hold me mr
[1:09:34] second 1 25. praise the lord give me
[1:09:36] some praises
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:46] in the amplified
[1:09:48] it says here all right let me read here
[1:09:50] the one he gave five talents probably
[1:09:53] about five thousand dollars to another
[1:09:54] two to another one to each in proportion
[1:09:57] of his own personal ability then he
[1:09:59] departed and left the country he would
[1:10:02] receive the five talents went at once
[1:10:04] and traded with them
[1:10:06] and he gained five talents more
[1:10:09] that's part i wanted to get
[1:10:11] at once
[1:10:13] he didn't waste no time
[1:10:15] because profitability profitability
[1:10:19] he would
[1:10:20] i can't get it
[1:10:22] profitability have to do with
[1:10:25] work
[1:10:26] over time
[1:10:28] you don't get the profitability
[1:10:29] overnight
[1:10:31] and the longer you take to get started
[1:10:33] the longer you will get to be profitable
[1:10:36] it come like if you're corn seeds or you
[1:10:37] have pumpkin seeds or you have those
[1:10:39] seeds and you have sleepover you say boy
[1:10:41] you know man the potential i have here
[1:10:42] have a thousand pumpkin seeds yeah
[1:10:44] planted yet
[1:10:46] the longer you take to put it in the
[1:10:47] ground the longer you get pumpkin that
[1:10:49] you can sell the pumpkin
[1:10:50] you can tell all your family look on
[1:10:51] pumpkin seeds they have two dozen three
[1:10:53] dollars in fact the whole smoking season
[1:10:55] they don't want money
[1:10:56] but there's only potential like when you
[1:10:58] talk
[1:10:59] until you put it into the ground at once
[1:11:02] then nine months or how much month
[1:11:04] whether corn or whatever it is then you
[1:11:06] could be pumpkin go and sell and get the
[1:11:07] money
[1:11:09] are you seeing what i'm saying so that
[1:11:11] come like that man bury the seeds
[1:11:16] so at once at once pray is the name of
[1:11:19] the lord okay let's continue here now
[1:11:22] brother brown i'm just going to read
[1:11:22] this here a bit
[1:11:24] but
[1:11:25] and i we set out here with that sister
[1:11:27] moore's father and how he told me that
[1:11:29] in the early days back in those days
[1:11:31] when they were persecuted and turned out
[1:11:33] from everywhere
[1:11:35] that he was in a meeting once to where
[1:11:38] they had forbid them to worship the lord
[1:11:40] in the spirit
[1:11:42] and a group of people come up with shot
[1:11:44] and shot through the windows with
[1:11:45] pistols and rifles and an old sister
[1:11:47] standing in the floor with her hands up
[1:11:49] in the air praising god
[1:11:51] while the windows was being riddled with
[1:11:53] bullets from rifles and the bullet
[1:11:55] struck the woman's dress and fell to the
[1:11:57] floor
[1:11:58] without harm in her
[1:12:02] the spirit of god was taking care of the
[1:12:03] bullets
[1:12:05] that was coming their way
[1:12:07] then he said this
[1:12:09] we need to go back to a power of god
[1:12:13] and something that can do the same thing
[1:12:15] today
[1:12:17] persecution always gives strength to the
[1:12:20] church we have had it too easy
[1:12:24] we get slutful
[1:12:25] we get to a place where we don't want to
[1:12:27] move on because everything is handed to
[1:12:30] us
[1:12:31] are you ready
[1:12:32] it takes sorrow
[1:12:35] and tears
[1:12:36] and sweat
[1:12:37] and prayer and faith and promise to move
[1:12:42] forward in the power of the holy spirit
[1:12:46] that is a statement repeating
[1:12:49] it takes sorrow
[1:12:51] and tears and sweat and prayer and faith
[1:12:56] and promise to move forward in the power
[1:12:59] of the holy spirit
[1:13:01] that zeal and power that they had in
[1:13:03] those days has long time vanished from
[1:13:05] our assemblies i'm afraid if the windows
[1:13:08] would be shut out at night people would
[1:13:09] run everywhere and never come back again
[1:13:14] and another thing is too bad
[1:13:16] you know to think of those things
[1:13:17] happening like that
[1:13:19] yet it proves that the god that was in
[1:13:22] the old days is still god today
[1:13:26] the god that was ever remains god
[1:13:29] and he expect his people
[1:13:31] to keep their vows
[1:13:33] and their promises but when we get
[1:13:35] everything too easy
[1:13:37] then we let it slip along and the first
[1:13:39] thing you know we have gone from these
[1:13:41] things losing our inheritance
[1:13:45] wait a minute brother over you could
[1:13:46] lose inheritance yes sir
[1:13:49] what do you think happened to that man
[1:13:53] the master said take what he have
[1:13:56] and give it to the man with 10 talents
[1:13:58] and jesus put
[1:14:01] a claws under there
[1:14:03] to him who hacked more shall be given
[1:14:06] unto him who had not the little that he
[1:14:08] hath will be taken away from him
[1:14:10] he put it under there
[1:14:12] intellectual god said but it's not fear
[1:14:14] for how come that man attained already
[1:14:18] why ever take from imam with one again
[1:14:20] again
[1:14:21] here's why
[1:14:22] when jesus welcomed them he said good
[1:14:24] and faithful
[1:14:26] servant
[1:14:27] this dude
[1:14:28] who bury it
[1:14:30] he said wicked and slutful
[1:14:32] he's not good
[1:14:34] and on top are not good he's lazy
[1:14:41] what is it it's a promise
[1:14:44] god made the promise let's stay with it
[1:14:47] god promise it no matter you've got to
[1:14:50] have a battle
[1:14:51] if everything comes lazy you are
[1:14:54] overcoming they overcome by the word of
[1:14:56] god and their testimony the blood of
[1:14:58] jesus christ you've got to overcome
[1:15:00] something

[1:15:25] oh glory to god don't say god just take
[1:15:27] this child take this and take this yeah
[1:15:29] you can take all of that but where what
[1:15:31] you're going to overcome

[1:15:34] have to get some situation that's
[1:15:36] negative that is challenging where
[1:15:37] there's a mountain where there's a red
[1:15:39] sea where there's a lions in the lion

[1:16:34] this is scary
[1:16:36] because it means
[1:16:38] that we have to understand god want
[1:16:40] profitability
[1:16:43] and god won't increase
[1:16:46] not just to rely upon your gift
[1:16:49] or rely upon your talent
[1:16:51] but add into it
[1:16:58] all right
[1:17:00] note one
[1:17:04] nothing in your life is a permanent
[1:17:06] possession
[1:17:09] whether car
[1:17:10] husband
[1:17:11] wife
[1:17:13] even all this relationship husband and
[1:17:14] wife is until that do a spa
[1:17:16] pattern is part of it until then
[1:17:20] we are stewards
[1:17:23] of managers
[1:17:25] this is my child this is my child for
[1:17:27] how long
[1:17:30] you're stewards over what god gives you
[1:17:32] god give your children
[1:17:34] guys alone
[1:17:39] god gave you a job
[1:17:40] and you're flashing and flashing and
[1:17:42] before the clock spinning too fast
[1:17:44] six years hit you and you know you're
[1:17:46] doing that job you're retired now
[1:17:48] i thought you had the job i told you it
[1:17:49] was yours wait gone
[1:17:51] they don't want you know they say sexy
[1:17:52] move on
[1:17:58] it is not yours
[1:18:00] it is what you got from god
[1:18:03] you are a manager
[1:18:05] not the owner
[1:18:09] and management is for time
[1:18:12] let's get that to your time
[1:18:17] you know i was given 120 years
[1:18:20] jesus was given to the three and a half
[1:18:22] years
[1:18:23] how much time do you have
[1:18:26] all what we have to do and accomplish is
[1:18:29] within
[1:18:30] t-i-m-e time
[1:18:33] here's why the day of accountability is
[1:18:36] coming
[1:18:38] that is what we learn from this it may
[1:18:40] take long
[1:18:41] but it's still coming
[1:18:50] like by the punjabi the day of
[1:18:52] recognition
[1:18:55] god told joshua
[1:18:57] meditate on the word day and night to
[1:18:59] have
[1:19:01] good success
[1:19:03] do you hear that
[1:19:05] it wasn't god coming to fight for joshua
[1:19:06] you know he said yeah what boss man
[1:19:09] you want that good success
[1:19:11] you meditated in one day and night
[1:19:13] and no man shall be able to stand before
[1:19:15] thee all the days of their life
[1:19:17] in other words it was conditional and
[1:19:19] just for doing what god told him to do
[1:19:21] you have to obey what god tell you to do
[1:19:28] so success is the product of our work
[1:19:31] that word is spelled w-o-r-k people
[1:19:32] don't like it they're still there
[1:19:34] quick
[1:19:38] mastery in any field
[1:19:41] is not an accident
[1:19:45] whether to play a piano a guitar a
[1:19:47] mechanic any field
[1:19:50] mastery
[1:19:52] is not flukes
[1:19:54] it's not by chance it's not by accident
[1:19:56] i'm a master piano player
[1:20:00] i remember
[1:20:01] when i had a guitar my channel was very
[1:20:03] small
[1:20:04] i used to take the guitar and play and
[1:20:05] they were so impressed
[1:20:07] i could still play that same thing right
[1:20:09] now
[1:20:11] afterwards when they get older i
[1:20:13] recognize i couldn't play at all
[1:20:17] because they were small like
[1:20:20] i do know all the fancy things you know
[1:20:21] i'm doing my hands something and i wear
[1:20:23] whenever some comedy come out but there
[1:20:24] was no song really i couldn't play from
[1:20:27] my book i couldn't read nothing is
[1:20:29] afterwards they exposed me
[1:20:32] i could take a piano and you know type
[1:20:34] of amazing grace or whatever the same
[1:20:35] thing could do up to them
[1:20:37] i'm not a master in that i can't play
[1:20:38] that
[1:20:39] i can fool around a little bit but i
[1:20:41] can't play if that people could play
[1:20:42] this thing
[1:20:43] but to be a
[1:20:44] mustang you have to work
[1:20:48] on it
[1:20:50] you have to improve on it
[1:20:53] you could stay at one level in piano one
[1:20:55] level in base one level and get one
[1:20:57] leveling mechanic one lap you can set
[1:20:59] one level you know but you can go higher
[1:21:01] but to go higher you have to study
[1:21:04] you have to apply yourself
[1:21:05] you have to be diligent and then you are
[1:21:08] recognized to be a master in that field
[1:21:10] whether you're a builder whether you're
[1:21:12] a bricklayer whatever it is the way you
[1:21:14] conduct yourself people know you are a
[1:21:16] master at what you do
[1:21:18] oh give the lord some praises
[1:21:20] hallelujah
[1:21:23] so you can't be a master without
[1:21:25] diligence
[1:21:27] diligence

[1:21:30] illness meaning meaning
