[38:35] called
[38:37] and justified
[38:38] predestinated called justified and we
[38:41] know who he justified he already
[38:43] glorified isn't that right another
[38:45] inspiration the revival of the justified
[38:48] oh glory to god the revival of the
[38:50] justified you're going to find out what
[38:52] justified is
[38:54] justified is not forgiven justified as
[38:57] if you never did it
[38:58] you want to tell me god justify me and i
[39:01] ain't gonna shout i ain't gonna dance i
[39:03] ain't gonna have a jubilee
[39:05] oh go who you throwing you he call
[39:07] oh glory to god and he predestinate you
[39:09] to be in this hour
[39:11] you could have been luther's age you
[39:12] could be in wesley
[39:14] [Applause]
[39:15] [Music]
[39:17] glory to god before i had my children
[39:20] god saw my grandchildren
[39:23] [Music]
[39:25] they was already on their way before i
[39:27] even had my own children
[39:29] that's what god has predestinated
[39:31] he does see weidong
[39:34] why what is the purpose of having a
[39:35] vision
[39:38] the purpose of having a vision is to
[39:40] show you something when it is not yet
[39:44] [Applause]
[39:47] that's the purpose of a vision
[39:49] it is not yet but it will be
[39:53] [Applause]
[39:54] so therefore our vision always have an
[39:57] appointed time
[39:59] [Applause]
[40:00] [Music]
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:04] so if god gave you a vision of your
[40:06] healing a vision of your breakthrough a
[40:08] vision of your baptism holy ghost a
[40:09] vision of your adoption all of that is
[40:11] to tell you it's coming
[40:14] [Music]
[40:14] [Applause]
[40:16] and the just
[40:18] shall live
[40:20] by his faith
[40:22] not by your feelings
[40:24] [Music]
[40:26] because the vision could be completely
[40:28] contrary to your feelings
[40:32] you may be seated
[40:33] one time brother branham had a vision of
[40:35] killing a grizzly tip beer
[40:38] and when he's had a walk and say you're
[40:40] gonna get it
[40:41] somebody said look at the grass
[40:43] you could see for miles there's no beard
[40:45] here
[40:47] it cannot have any beard you say if god
[40:49] said
[40:51] that i go kill a brisley beer
[40:54] in this environment when the grass all
[40:56] or god is able to make and produce and
[40:59] have a beer right there
[41:02] next minute when they look they see a
[41:04] big bear standing there figure that one
[41:06] out well i ain't figuring out nothing
[41:09] if god said there will be a bright
[41:11] revival
[41:13] there's going to be a bright revival
[41:16] if god said they're going to be healing
[41:18] blind knight will pop open people are
[41:20] going to walk
[41:22] dude i'm going to speak
[41:24] they're going to hear it must have death
[41:27] people to bust their ears open it must
[41:30] have dumb people that god's going to
[41:32] have to speak
[41:34] must have blind people to see
[41:37] oh give the lord a shout i know what's
[41:39] coming
[41:41] all glory to god is a right division
[41:45] make it
[41:46] plain oh glory to god you have to see it
[41:49] you have to talk about it it's coming
[41:52] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[41:55] glory so let's go
[41:57] god help me this morning
[42:01] [Music]
[42:04] let's talk a little bit about joseph
[42:07] story of joseph just a little tiny bit
[42:09] about joseph love of the father
[42:12] love so much that the father makes them
[42:14] a quote of many colors
[42:17] and you know
[42:18] from the humanistic realm it looked like
[42:20] we would say the father favored joseph
[42:23] you know joseph was like he spotted a
[42:24] child he wasn't the first he wasn't he's
[42:26] second he wasn't detailed he was
[42:28] somewhere down on the road and the
[42:30] father kind of curry favor as we would
[42:32] say and whatnot but when you look
[42:34] a little deeper
[42:36] you would realize
[42:38] jose's brother's spirit were off
[42:42] it was always off
[42:44] before the father made code for jesus
[42:47] before the father do what he did for
[42:49] joseph
[42:50] those brothers didn't even know how off
[42:52] they were
[42:53] it took joseph's vision and dreams
[42:56] to expose
[42:59] the spirit that was in them
[43:02] because that is what was in them
[43:05] jealousy was in them but they had
[43:06] nothing to jealous yet
[43:08] so they're just brethren because
[43:10] nobody's staring nobody's stepping out
[43:13] in perfection
[43:14] nobody's stepping out a class act
[43:17] all by themselves
[43:19] nobody step out with authenticity
[43:22] all glory to god they couldn't have
[43:23] nothing to compare themselves with but
[43:26] when joseph walk a certain way
[43:28] talk a certain way
[43:30] live a certain way in so much his father
[43:34] put a blessing upon him
[43:36] then brothers had to watch him cut i
[43:38] had i
[43:39] and i am telling you when god put his
[43:42] touch upon you
[43:44] come on now don't hold back now
[43:46] don't hold back now you're telling
[43:48] what's coming
[43:49] oh glory to god because god for you
[43:53] what's in you
[43:55] do you get where i'm going this morning
[43:57] and who is on you
[44:02] he called
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:07] [Music]
[44:11] that was given to jose it represented
[44:13] the holy spirit that covered his being
[44:16] and today it's the holy spirit that
[44:18] covers the church the robe of many
[44:21] colors so all that was just a type
[44:24] to represent the elect in this last day
[44:27] getting the robe of many colors
[44:30] favored by the father not because you're
[44:33] doing you're so nice but then brothers
[44:35] messed up
[44:37] and you will expose all them who messed
[44:39] up
[44:40] oh my hallelujah
[44:42] let's continue
[44:44] so watch
[44:45] god was eternal he had attributes and
[44:48] endear represents uh the word of god
[44:51] which was made flesh and dwell among us
[44:54] now this fellow here
[44:55] the woman of the well the priest the
[44:57] pharisee and where you seed he said
[45:00] grace and salvation in the beginning was
[45:01] the word the word was made flesh and
[45:04] well among us three stages it was
[45:05] attribute first in god the thought
[45:08] as him being a human and that
[45:10] transmitted him down to jesus
[45:12] watch and therefore there's only one
[45:14] form of eternal life and that's god you
[45:16] had to be part of god at the beginning
[45:18] not what you choose down here is he
[45:21] chose you
[45:22] so that's why you say all that the
[45:24] father had given me will come
[45:26] say they say ton you could do what you
[45:27] want all that the father had given me
[45:28] will come
[45:29] you could lie to them you could try to
[45:31] deceive them with all that the father
[45:33] had i'm not talking about no he given me
[45:35] before
[45:36] oh glory to god do you see that now
[45:38] now look at this priest here we find out
[45:42] there's a priest now
[45:44] did he remember the long tall heart
[45:45] everybody respect him this is priest now
[45:47] this man with bible and scroll this is
[45:49] priest now he often sacrificed this is
[45:51] priest we're talking about now
[45:53] but listen to this
[45:55] watch
[45:56] he said no
[45:57] uh
[45:59] all right so the priest now we find his
[46:01] bottom part here his back life behind
[46:03] him predestination back there is sinful
[46:09] so in front
[46:10] in the world with his long gong and my
[46:12] shoes and polish shoes and well polished
[46:14] and everything else tall cap and
[46:15] everything else he is he's a priest
[46:18] everybody will come to the garment we'll
[46:19] call him out just want to hear him out
[46:21] his predestination is sinful now watch
[46:24] no no
[46:25] no no no outside represent purity he was
[46:28] a priest he was an honorable man that
[46:30] presented this right now this woman who
[46:32] wanted a well
[46:34] her first life she was a prostitute
[46:37] she was mad up
[46:38] but way down here
[46:42] i know when the messiah come when jesus
[46:45] came he manifested the torts it's the
[46:48] torch now the priest with only
[46:50] intellectual learning called jesus the
[46:52] devil
[46:56] he's in humanistic realm he's using his
[46:58] senses and his senses saying you're not
[47:01] with us you are devil
[47:03] your word i we don't believe that so
[47:05] you're off you're a devil
[47:08] but this woman
[47:09] when the word was interpreted to her she
[47:12] called him what i perceived that what a
[47:14] prophet isn't that right
[47:16] so watch
[47:17] the priest with only intellectual
[47:19] learning said it's the devil because
[47:22] what is the nomination called it what
[47:23] did he do he had no representation so it
[47:26] blocked him out
[47:28] says only when a manifestation comes it
[47:30] has an effect
[47:32] it light you up or block you out
[47:39] that was just if i didn't come you would
[47:41] you know you you claim it to be light
[47:43] now that i come you're walking in
[47:45] darkness because the light has come
[47:48] so it's only when a manifestation come
[47:50] oh glory everything begins to expose
[47:52] right there you don't know who is who
[47:54] oh glory to god hallelujah but the
[47:56] manifestation will be the interpretation
[47:59] so god going to manifest and declare you
[48:02] oh glory to god who who we talking about
[48:05] who he for knew
[48:07] who he predestinate who he called
[48:10] and who he justified
[48:12] oh god and you're gonna get a revelation
[48:13] of your justification
[48:15] you're gonna get an experience of your
[48:16] justification
[48:18] oh glory to god because justification
[48:20] means that there is nothing against you
[48:23] oh give the lord a praise offering
[48:26] therefore you are joseph perfection
[48:29] the capstone word that's a revelation
[48:30] you know
[48:32] not jacob grace
[48:33] oh glory to god let's continue now
[48:36] so when he spoke to the woman he said
[48:38] you told the truth because you had five
[48:40] and the one you have now is not your
[48:41] husband watch something happen
[48:44] look
[48:45] life now if she hadn't had listen
[48:48] representation by predestination it
[48:52] would have never took a hole
[48:54] she had what
[48:56] representation by predestination so
[48:58] she's a wrong sinner on the earth
[49:00] everybody can see her life and her
[49:02] behavior but she had representation
[49:05] by predestination
[49:06] she herself didn't even know that
[49:10] but the light had to come to her
[49:12] to expose
[49:14] her representation
[49:16] by predestination
[49:18] she thought in life all she was was a
[49:20] stinking prostitute but when jesus come
[49:23] he come to bring light
[49:25] and when the light shine on her
[49:27] not the front part
[49:29] the back part
[49:30] that's where he thunders his hat you
[49:32] know
[49:32] that's where the devil didn't want the
[49:34] seven seal to break enough
[49:36] it's not the front part the fun part
[49:38] you're a smoker you're a drinker you're
[49:40] a liar cheating at this that's the fun
[49:42] part but the backpack
[49:44] which is the gene part which is the
[49:46] attribute pack which is the part that
[49:49] connects you back to elohim
[49:51] which is the sort
[49:53] oh lord that path
[49:55] oh
[49:56] hallelujah that is what the light come
[49:59] to activate
[50:00] that's why i don't care what the
[50:01] children doing right now
[50:03] i look at the pipe and coke right now if
[50:06] they're smoking dope right now
[50:08] brother when that blood hung of the holy
[50:10] ghost
[50:11] be going to right after them
[50:14] glory to god
[50:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:19] you may be seated
[50:21] remember one of the brothers those
[50:22] believers came to the branham tabernacle
[50:24] service somebody who stole him anka
[50:27] oliman family thinking inside the car
[50:29] going to the prophet just tell him what
[50:31] he lost somebody stole his car they were
[50:32] stealing cars a lot in those times
[50:34] and the problem began to pray
[50:36] and when he began to pray he saw a
[50:38] vision he saw the man driving he saw the
[50:41] holy spirit arresting the man
[50:43] the man pulling aside
[50:44] he saw how much how much how much how
[50:47] far he went thomas gas in his tank
[50:49] conviction arrest man you tell me god
[50:52] can i arrest your son
[50:54] lock him up
[50:56] and bring him back home
[50:58] what do you think god did to us
[51:01] we were in bondage
[51:03] and he take and deliver us
[51:05] from out of the hands of the enemy god
[51:08] went and bust the hand of satan
[51:11] break the bands of wickedness over you
[51:14] know you have the liberty
[51:16] to express your love for god satan is a
[51:18] liar this morning
[51:20] that's why we had to worship god
[51:23] we know what we worship
[51:25] woman y'all are coming always
[51:27] come on help me preach somebody
[51:29] we're the true worshipers
[51:31] we'll worship the father
[51:34] nobody ain't gonna kill me dead in this
[51:35] message
[51:37] oh glory to god hallelujah no body anger
[51:40] no man no deacon or church strike me
[51:43] with debt
[51:46] [Applause]
[51:52] let me see it
[51:54] second peter 1 20 bible says knowing
[51:56] this verse that no prophecies of of the
[51:58] scripture
[52:00] is of private interpretation
[52:02] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[52:04] the will of man
[52:05] but holy men of god spake
[52:07] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[52:10] so from wisdom versus faith say no no he
[52:13] tries to make the word say something
[52:15] knowledge
[52:16] wisdom reasoning
[52:19] wisdom finds a better way
[52:21] there's no other way but god's way
[52:23] wisdom tries to point out and say well
[52:24] you see we ought to do we couldn't do
[52:27] that and this time we must do it anyhow
[52:29] tries to find an easy way tries to make
[52:32] the bible say things it does not say
[52:35] that is what wisdom does
[52:37] try to make the bible or the message or
[52:38] the word say something it did not say
[52:40] let's continue wait a moment we go back
[52:42] to the seed again what was the devil
[52:44] trying to do with wisdom
[52:45] make
[52:46] god's word
[52:48] say something that it didn't say
[52:50] he tried to make god's word say
[52:52] something that it didn't say so that's
[52:54] the way it comes today when they try to
[52:57] make god's word say something it doesn't
[52:59] say you say well brother branham you
[53:01] ain't got the right interpretation
[53:04] he said the bible said prophecy is of no
[53:07] private interpretation
[53:09] prophecy
[53:10] why why a is the private interpretation
[53:12] why the word of the lord came to the
[53:14] prophets
[53:15] it is to be interpreted by the prophet
[53:18] and as far as i know it have no malakai
[53:21] four and a half malakai
[53:25] foreign anybody else it says behold i
[53:28] will send you elijah the prophet
[53:31] and he
[53:32] and he only let me say it again good and
[53:35] he
[53:36] he only
[53:37] shall turn the hearts of the children
[53:39] back to the faith of the fathers you
[53:41] have no scripture for man making that
[53:43] interpretation to what the prophet
[53:45] brought
[53:46] he said the spirit the prophet and the
[53:48] bride will say the same thing
[53:51] oh glory to god
[53:53] what she said it is to be interpreted by
[53:55] the prophet it can't be an
[53:57] interpretation private
[53:59] the prophets
[54:01] already interpreted to you
[54:04] so the ministers and pastors was to
[54:07] bring light or bring it into a greater
[54:09] reality of what the prophet said
[54:12] not a new teaching
[54:14] not some new revelation but to bring to
[54:17] light
[54:18] what has been interpreted
[54:20] because no man can interpret the
[54:22] unwritten word the right rock
[54:24] it's like a prophet to interpret the
[54:26] unwritten word
[54:28] hallelujah i can't interpret on written
[54:30] word
[54:31] oh glory to god the mystery was sealed
[54:33] and it's like a prophet the angel to
[54:35] bring it on to the prophet put it on
[54:37] books and tapes and you will reveal it
[54:39] when you have reason to see it
[54:46] so what in the beginning was the word
[54:47] i'm going to skip down there so fate
[54:49] believes
[54:51] a god that can make me
[54:54] and can keep that book in order to make
[54:55] me live by
[54:57] so it cannot be like mistakes in it
[54:59] if god could keep us he can keep that
[55:02] word
[55:03] god keep that written word
[55:04] he have it just as he wanted
[55:07] it had no mistakes
[55:08] oh glory to god watch
[55:11] amen so i'm going to read the scripture
[55:12] from romans 10. you could open it if you
[55:14] want to find it from 17
[55:16] uh okay sorry romans 10
[55:18] it says so faith come by hearing and
[55:20] hearing by the word of god
[55:22] and this scripture here
[55:23] from romans i believe therefore
[55:27] by the deeds of the law of verse 20
[55:29] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[55:31] sight
[55:32] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[55:35] and now the righteousness of god without
[55:37] the law is manifest being witnessed by
[55:38] the law and the prophets
[55:40] even the righteousness of god which is
[55:42] by faith of jesus christ unto all upon
[55:45] them that believe there is no difference
[55:47] for all have sinned
[55:48] and come short
[55:50] of the glory of god
[55:52] being justified freely by his grace
[55:56] through the redemption that is in christ
[55:58] jesus whom god has set forth to be
[56:01] appropriation through fate in his blood
[56:03] to declare his righteousness for
[56:05] remission of his sins that are passed
[56:07] through the forbearance of god to
[56:09] declare i say all this time his
[56:11] righteousness that he might be just and
[56:14] the justifier of them that believe in
[56:16] jesus
[56:18] where is the boast in them it is
[56:20] excluded by what law of works nay but by
[56:24] the law of faith
[56:25] therefore we conclude
[56:27] paul
[56:28] that a man is justified by faith
[56:32] without the deeds of the law
[56:35] is he the god of the jews only is he not
[56:37] also the gentiles yes of the gentiles
[56:39] also seeing it is one god which shall
[56:41] justify the circumcision by faith and
[56:44] the uncircumcision true faith do we then
[56:46] make void the law through faith god
[56:48] forbid we establish the law
[56:50] then he said what shall we say then of
[56:52] abraham our father aspartame to the
[56:54] flesh had found
[56:56] if abraham was justified by works he had
[56:58] to bear after glory but not before god
[57:00] but what saith the scripture
[57:03] what the scriptures say abraham
[57:05] believed god and it was counted unto him
[57:08] for righteousness
[57:10] his confession of faith in god god
[57:12] ticket off
[57:14] has been declared righteous
[57:16] oh glory to god he didn't have to do
[57:18] nothing
[57:19] he believed god
[57:20] oh glory to god and god justified him
[57:24] god counted his faith as righteous
[57:27] oh glory to god you love him this
[57:28] morning

[57:32] reckon of grace but of debt
[57:34] but to him that worketh not
[57:36] but believe it on him that justified the
[57:39] ungodly his fate is counted for
[57:42] righteousness

[1:04:05] if you come to some other family you

[1:04:13] find you you didn't find it you know
[1:04:15] come on now come on i'll show shout on
[1:04:17] that one
[1:04:18] you did not find it

[1:04:23] you ain't looking for this message
[1:04:25] this message i'm looking for you
[1:04:27] whoa
[1:04:28] oh glory to god
[1:04:30] my syllabus i still am not jumping me
[1:04:33] i still never shouting me
[1:04:35] i may be getting great but i still have
[1:04:37] a praise
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:48] so how was this righteousness reckon to
[1:04:50] abraham in circumcision on circumcision
[1:04:53] but in uncircumcision
[1:04:55] the bible says and he received the sign
[1:04:57] of circumcision
[1:04:58] and that sign was a seal
[1:05:01] of the righteousness
[1:05:03] of the faith
[1:05:05] which he had
[1:05:06] yet been uncircumcised
[1:05:10] he was uncircumcised but god brings
[1:05:13] circumcision
[1:05:15] to confirm
[1:05:16] the fate
[1:05:17] that he had
[1:05:19] while he was uncircumcised
[1:05:22] and by your faith
[1:05:24] you are just a fact
[1:05:26] oh give the lord a shout
[1:05:28] you can feel joseph
[1:05:31] you got to believe
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:40] did you get that
[1:05:43] did you get you can't feel for this
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:50] you see the sign of circumcision
[1:05:52] a seal of the russians of the fate
[1:05:54] which he had been uncircumcised
[1:05:56] that
[1:05:57] he
[1:05:58] might be
[1:05:59] the father of all them that believe
[1:06:02] though there be not circumcised
[1:06:06] so you see all this circumcision that
[1:06:08] the jews was boasting of covenant people
[1:06:10] and we are the circumcised and amen was
[1:06:12] a father and jesus had to bust them
[1:06:15] because abraham had this faith before
[1:06:21] so then let's look up this juting
[1:06:25] this favored people thing
[1:06:27] it mashed that up
[1:06:29] so when christ come fights bring the
[1:06:31] cross
[1:06:32] that neither jew nor gentile
[1:06:35] born or free
[1:06:37] male nor female
[1:06:40] all one incredible
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:47] this is not heresy you know
[1:06:49] this is weird
[1:06:50] all right
[1:06:52] and the father of the circumcision to
[1:06:53] them who are not of the secret only but
[1:06:55] also who walk in the steps of that fate
[1:06:59] of our father abraham which he had been
[1:07:01] yet uncircumcised for the promise that
[1:07:04] he should be heir of the world was not
[1:07:06] the abraham or to his seed through the
[1:07:08] law
[1:07:09] but through the righteousness of faith
[1:07:11] for everyday which of the law be ears
[1:07:14] then fate is made void
[1:07:16] and the promise is made of non-effect
[1:07:18] then we better get a temple and put an
[1:07:19] alternate guess and kill some goats and
[1:07:21] cows and different things
[1:07:23] he said if faith if the law is the thing
[1:07:25] that i do weak i qualify at all because
[1:07:27] we have no temple we have no temple
[1:07:29] priests you follow i'm saying so watch
[1:07:32] down now because the law will get right
[1:07:34] for there will no no law is there is no
[1:07:35] transgression therefore it is a faith
[1:07:38] that it might be by grace
[1:07:42] so now this predestination come now as
[1:07:44] predestinated grace
[1:07:50] listen you should you should be praising
[1:07:52] god not suffering
[1:07:54] the preacher should be one to say rest
[1:07:56] restrict yourself
[1:08:00] you you understand what we're seeing
[1:08:01] here this morning
[1:08:03] this is the bible yeah now
[1:08:05] watch
[1:08:06] watch therefore it is a fate that might
[1:08:08] be by grace to the end the promise might
[1:08:10] be to
[1:08:11] be sure to all the seed not to that only
[1:08:15] which is of the law but that also which
[1:08:18] is of the faith of abraham who is the
[1:08:20] father of us all
[1:08:21] for it is written i have maybe a father
[1:08:23] many nations before him who we believe
[1:08:25] even god who quicknet the dead and call
[1:08:28] it those things which be not as though

[1:14:25] all them had moses books and quotes and
[1:14:27] tips but all them didn't really believe
[1:14:30] it only affect upon joshua and caleb
[1:14:32] the rest of them was killing time
[1:14:40] so the scripture has concluded all under
[1:14:42] sin
[1:14:43] that the promise of faith of jesus might
[1:14:45] be given to them that believe
[1:14:46] but before faith came
[1:14:49] before this faith came
[1:14:51] because you need fear to be justified
[1:14:53] hallelujah before faith came
[1:14:55] we were kept under the law
[1:14:58] shut up unto the faith we should
[1:15:00] afterwards be revealed
[1:15:01] wherefore the law was our school master
[1:15:04] to bring us to christ
[1:15:05] that we might be justified by faith
[1:15:08] so your good nice works your goody two
[1:15:11] shoes works
[1:15:12] cannot justify you
[1:15:16] you could wear your
[1:15:18] wear your top to the choke up here
[1:15:21] where you're dressing and sweep the
[1:15:22] floor
[1:15:24] wear shades on your eye
[1:15:26] and cover your head with a bonnet
[1:15:28] that nobody loves after you
[1:15:30] oh glory to god that still doesn't
[1:15:32] justify you
[1:15:33] glory to god
[1:15:35] never lie never you're still going to
[1:15:37] hell if you don't repent
[1:15:40] that doesn't justify you
[1:15:42] brand new tie shoot that doesn't justify
[1:15:45] you
[1:15:46] all glory it will be self-hit
[1:15:48] [Music]
[1:15:50] and 700.
[1:15:52] gets paid
[1:15:57] so this is a revival
[1:15:59] of the justify
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:03] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:08] god is about to unlock heaven
[1:16:10] the same voice that shot the heavens
[1:16:13] that same voice going to unlock the
[1:16:14] heavens
[1:16:16] i hear the song of the abundance of red
[1:16:20] dynamics to the mechanics
[1:16:22] signs wonders miracles

[1:29:21] the spirit
[1:29:22] and the bride
[1:29:24] think of
[1:29:26] whoa
[1:29:28] oh glory to god
[1:29:29] i'm having myself a time this morning
[1:29:32] i'm gonna preach myself happy
[1:29:34] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:29:37] now watch there's only two
[1:29:39] he said two forces two two things wisdom
[1:29:42] versus fate and not god deepers i'm
[1:29:44] talking about now the wisdom that put
[1:29:46] people from the word he said there's
[1:29:47] only two sources we can draw our life
[1:29:49] from just two
[1:29:50] one of them is wisdom
[1:29:52] and the other is fate
[1:29:54] now faith was introduced and wisdom was
[1:29:56] introduced in genesis
[1:29:57] and satan is the author of wisdom trying
[1:30:00] to get the people to accept his wisdom
[1:30:03] and pull them away from the faith that
[1:30:05] in god's word
[1:30:06] notice what the devil tell eve if you
[1:30:08] eat of this tree god know you will be
[1:30:09] wise
[1:30:12] and all he has to do was believe god
[1:30:14] said so and i said
[1:30:16] tell your story working satan
[1:30:18] my husband come here but went to your
[1:30:20] wisdom
[1:30:21] when she had the knowledge that he was
[1:30:23] supposed to reveal to her she bow to
[1:30:25] that and that's how we get messed up
[1:30:27] all right now god is the order of fate
[1:30:29] satan is the out of wisdom
[1:30:31] god gave his children his word told them
[1:30:33] they must believe this and put a debt
[1:30:35] separation punishment if they feel they
[1:30:36] believe it satan comes a wrong and offer
[1:30:39] eve wisdom you will be wise knowing
[1:30:41] right from wrong see now of course
[1:30:44] anything that the devil has is a
[1:30:45] perversion of the original so the wisdom
[1:30:47] that i want you to get straight note
[1:30:49] before we start there is a wisdom of god
[1:30:52] and the wisdom of god is to stay with
[1:30:54] his word
[1:30:55] but satan in his wisdom tried to twist
[1:30:57] the word so that that's the wisdom i'm
[1:30:59] speaking about
[1:31:00] so watch there's a certain amount of
[1:31:01] faith that goes with satan
[1:31:04] that accepts it and you have to believe
[1:31:06] satan
[1:31:07] is a perverted fate so he said you don't
[1:31:09] want to revert referred it as satan's
[1:31:11] fate so he referred to it as wisdom
[1:31:15] not satan's fate
[1:31:16] all right now there are children on
[1:31:18] either side
[1:31:20] on the wisdom side
[1:31:22] and on the faith side
[1:31:23] and if the faith of god came through god
[1:31:25] and god is the word god's children lives
[1:31:27] on faith
[1:31:29] the josh shall live not by wisdom
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:32] but they're just silly by faith
[1:31:34] and faith come i hear in the word
[1:31:36] so the children on the faith side they
[1:31:37] believe the word
[1:31:39] they connect with the word are you with
[1:31:40] me
[1:31:41] oh glory to god hallelujah so there are
[1:31:44] so many people today that has the right
[1:31:46] knowledge
[1:31:47] that knows that this word should be
[1:31:49] god's word and this is god's word but
[1:31:51] they stand and let some seminary student
[1:31:54] reason them out of it away from the holy
[1:31:56] spirit
[1:31:57] and away from the things of god
[1:31:59] oh glory to god so faith has no reason
[1:32:03] faith doesn't know what reason is
[1:32:05] oh glory to god when abraham was told to

[1:35:50] your true eternal dream from the
[1:35:52] beginning takes hold
[1:35:53] no here we go there's a part i want to
[1:35:54] get to almost done
[1:35:57] no you are not only forgiven
[1:36:00] but you are justified
[1:36:04] justified
[1:36:07] look up the word the word don't mean
[1:36:09] forgiven the word mean justified it
[1:36:11] don't mean forgive him for instance if i
[1:36:12] got drunk and done some evil things and
[1:36:14] everything you come around and said you
[1:36:15] found out i didn't do them didn't you
[1:36:17] come around and say but i brown i
[1:36:18] forgive you forgive me i didn't do the
[1:36:19] first place
[1:36:20] but if i did do it i'm guilty
[1:36:22] and you could forgive me but i wouldn't
[1:36:24] be guilty and yet i'm not justified
[1:36:26] because i actually done it but the word
[1:36:29] justified is though you've never done it
[1:36:35] i don't think people get this yet you
[1:36:36] know
[1:36:38] i don't think the people are getting
[1:36:39] that
[1:36:40] because your self-condemnation and
[1:36:42] self-pity and you wallowing in your past
[1:36:44] and what that doesn't help your faith
[1:36:46] whatsoever
[1:36:47] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:36:49] watch the word justify
[1:36:52] is though you've never done it
[1:36:54] it's not even regarded at all
[1:36:58] how is it done in god's book
[1:37:01] of the sea of forgetfulness
[1:37:03] your old book and marriage is divorced
[1:37:06] and dead
[1:37:07] it's not even in the memories of god
[1:37:13] did you hear that
[1:37:15] this is enough to bust up the ceiling
[1:37:16] you know
[1:37:17] and repair it next week you know
[1:37:19] this is not even the memories of god you
[1:37:22] are justified
[1:37:24] it was accused you was accused but you
[1:37:27] never did it
[1:37:28] the old union is in the sea of
[1:37:30] forgetfulness you wasn't married here to
[1:37:32] begin with he the bridegroom brought
[1:37:35] your shame
[1:37:37] he took your place
[1:37:40] you were predestinated for him
[1:37:43] to be
[1:37:44] in his bride
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:51] here is why this justification is so
[1:37:53] clean
[1:37:54] he said you were deceiving to it by your
[1:37:56] first marriage
[1:37:57] to your adulterous parent evil
[1:38:00] it's no fault of your own
[1:38:02] your natural birth you come after evil
[1:38:04] commit adultery that's the reason you
[1:38:06] were born an adulteress you are sinner
[1:38:08] to begin with you will deceive into it
[1:38:10] it ain't your fault
[1:38:14] that's right easy for justification to
[1:38:16] come to you
[1:38:17] because adam didn't fall we was not
[1:38:19] going to be in the state
[1:38:21] oh glory to god
[1:38:23] suffer goes to restore us back to ethan
[1:38:26] he had to make a provision for
[1:38:27] justification
[1:38:29] as if you never did it
[1:38:32] not just forgiven
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:41] so god put it there by predestination
[1:38:44] you were four day into a son of god you
[1:38:47] went god before the foundation of the
[1:38:48] world you're only manifested in this day
[1:38:51] for his honor and glory how can you do
[1:38:53] it without honoring his word and stand
[1:38:55] by every word
[1:38:56] the anointed word of his day
[1:38:58] of which you are apart
[1:39:00] by predestination
[1:39:02] you immediate when you hear it
[1:39:04] you know right then you was an eagle
[1:39:07] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:39:09] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:39:12] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:39:14] that's why braham say i'm the son of
[1:39:15] ella branham he said whose son i know
[1:39:19] oh glory to god
[1:39:21] mother sinful father sinful but now i'm

[1:39:34] bridegroom which ordained you has washed

[1:41:51] few minutes
[1:41:52] atmospheres of these sources

[1:42:10] and the people have a certain head
[1:42:13] hallelujah
[1:42:14] oh glory to god
[1:42:16] and somewhere preached faith will have a
[1:42:17] certain atmosphere where you could
[1:42:19] believe anything could happen
[1:42:21] where you could believe all things are
[1:42:22] possible where you can believe he's
[1:42:24] still a healer he says

[1:42:36] pastor is real statue

[1:42:41] brought it
[1:42:43] go into a place where the person says
[1:42:44] now wait a minute there's no such thing
[1:42:46] as as the hole he goes
[1:42:48] you will see every one of them
[1:42:50] if there's an eagle in there somewhere
[1:42:52] he will get out
[1:42:56] oh

[1:42:59] groups and them churches when they begin
[1:43:01] their city life they have to
[1:43:03] they can't help it
[1:43:04] oh glory to god you can't buy your eagle
[1:43:06] and tell them how old he goes it will
[1:43:08] never mind being a pulpit come on now we
[1:43:10] chose that old since the first age
[1:43:12] second is nicholas and spirit we kicked
[1:43:13] that out a long time
[1:43:15] some man trying to rule over the
[1:43:16] congregation god is a god of the
[1:43:18] audience
[1:43:19] he want to be among his people
[1:43:21] men are conducted bring god to the
[1:43:23] people not to bring more man to the
[1:43:25] people

[1:43:30] long time
[1:43:31] hallelujah
[1:43:33] he said no watch if there's an eagle in
[1:43:35] there somewhere he will get out from
[1:43:36] among the bunch of chickens
[1:43:38] watch
[1:43:39] watch now we find out that those
[1:43:41] atmospheres those things where faith is
[1:43:44] taught at church you'll find the church
[1:43:46] and that happens oh god he said let me
[1:43:49] get this to you
[1:43:50] if you could see it that's the reason
[1:43:52] people come among the saints when
[1:43:54] they're praying
[1:43:55] paul said he didn't find any in the city
[1:43:57] only timothy that was like precious fate
[1:43:59] the rest of them was all
[1:44:00] denominationalists but when he got into
[1:44:02] that atmosphere you find things going on
[1:44:05] that's the atmosphere was created you
[1:44:08] find people living by faith when you get
[1:44:09] into a place where it says my the bible
[1:44:12] is true god heals you walk around that
[1:44:14] congregation why i was then a cancer i
[1:44:17] was healed i was once blind i see the
[1:44:19] stranger said whoa you see what i mean
[1:44:21] what was the matter with you i can show
[1:44:24] you on record come home with me come eat
[1:44:27] dinner with me i will show you i got a
[1:44:29] record my neighbor no i wasn't a i was
[1:44:31] paralyzed for years and i was prayed for
[1:44:34] and that's the church we're talking
[1:44:36] about believers has created the
[1:44:38] atmosphere
[1:44:39] wait a minute the believers yes
[1:44:42] like you yes
[1:44:44] create an atmosphere
[1:44:46] that the sick can't stay sick
[1:44:49] the blind can't stay blind
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] no how is the word in simplicity
[1:45:02] but in its completeness ever going to
[1:45:04] grow
[1:45:05] in a place where knowledge overshadows
[1:45:06] that
[1:45:07] it can't be so
[1:45:09] so where knowledge is preached from a
[1:45:10] seminary the children die
[1:45:13] where faith is preached from the word
[1:45:14] the children live that's the difference
[1:45:17] just life
[1:45:18] and death
[1:45:19] the same thing happened to god in the
[1:45:20] eden that's exactly what happened with
[1:45:22] them to atmosphere
[1:45:24] when eve got off the right one the wrong
[1:45:27] one she died
[1:45:28] and they cannot stay if your church has
[1:45:30] got that kind of atmosphere if you want
[1:45:32] to live you believe the word
[1:45:34] you want to hear a bum
[1:45:36] the seed word cannot grow in the
[1:45:38] accuracy of
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:43] so they knowledge preach mystery till
[1:45:45] they blew in the face
[1:45:47] unless a atmosphere of faith and
[1:45:50] breakthrough dear
[1:45:51] that would bring the praises upon the
[1:45:53] people's lips
[1:45:56] [Applause]
[1:46:00] you see
[1:46:02] the seed word
[1:46:03] cannot grow in the atmosphere of
[1:46:05] knowledge
[1:46:07] eve said the lord god the day we eat
[1:46:09] that day we die right but satan said but
[1:46:11] listen dear you love little things
[1:46:12] surely god made you of a people you know
[1:46:15] that's right you're a woman you're made
[1:46:17] for purpose what you don't know it but
[1:46:20] you were made for this purpose you love
[1:46:22] little thing there look at those dainty
[1:46:24] little hands well you would not surely
[1:46:26] die
[1:46:27] you think that good loving father god
[1:46:29] would do such a thing like that
[1:46:31] what you do she listened
[1:46:33] to reason took his wisdom
[1:46:34] a tree of delight one desired of it and
[1:46:38] as soon as you fall for it it finished
[1:46:40] right there
[1:46:41] you see the seat she was holding and
[1:46:43] would have finally become a mother by
[1:46:44] the will of god through a spoken word
[1:46:46] she would have finally become a mother
[1:46:48] but she couldn't wait
[1:46:49] and she went into that
[1:46:51] so you see as soon as she accepted
[1:46:53] certain wisdom she died
[1:46:55] isn't that right
[1:46:56] and if wisdom is with the word that
[1:46:58] proves it to be with the word and the
[1:46:59] word produces itself that's that's fine
[1:47:01] but the holy ghost sees of the bible
[1:47:03] here we go this is our next bomb
[1:47:05] cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:47:08] all glory that kills every seminary that
[1:47:11] knocks the holes right off to them and
[1:47:12] punctures them
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:16] glory
[1:47:17] fo is a mystery
[1:47:19] see that growing nothing
[1:47:21] yes people have a big head
[1:47:24] hallelujah she wasn't supposed to listen
[1:47:26] to anybody oh my
[1:47:28] and you talk about this you know we
[1:47:30] could see 500 rush to the author tonight
[1:47:32] that would be a good sign the revival is
[1:47:34] about to break we don't have to have 500
[1:47:36] at the altar we just have to take god's
[1:47:38] word and start rejoicing
[1:47:40] something will happen
[1:47:41] that brings the world to life
[1:47:43] when we water it with praises
[1:47:46] that's why the devil fights all the
[1:47:47] shouting and the praising and the
[1:47:49] hallelujah in the church devil don't
[1:47:50] want that because once you start to get
[1:47:52] your praise it's going up
[1:47:55] you see when you're in sin you can't
[1:47:56] praise god you know you're heavy
[1:47:59] but when you accept the promise and you
[1:48:00] see god promise me the holy ghost oh my
[1:48:02] god i didn't actually promise you know
[1:48:04] god come down in love and say i've given
[1:48:06] you this i give you that i've given you
[1:48:08] think about it
[1:48:09] you live in this i'm all shack and some
