our Ambitions and our goals and we can focus on you and Lord your Ambitions and your goals and what you want for your bride and what you want for your church and what you want for your people and what you want for us we thank you for the presence the anointing the atmosphere Lord that's already here we thank you for the Angel that's an omits me thank you for the bread of life thank you that Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever may you strengthen your people this morning may you take me out of the way may you encourage your church we thank you this morning may you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding to it and the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen any man he may be seated for a few minutes certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning uh you're happy to be in the house of the lawn you know the psalmist David said I was glad when they said unto me letters go into the house of the Lord it's a good thing it's a choice to be in the house of the Lord It's a decision to be in the house of the Lord and it's nothing we ever want to take for granted it's nothing we ever want to take it as just something to do but it's a great privilege and an honor and I salute you for being here this morning we live in perilous times we live in dangerous times we live in times when men's hearts are feeling for fear and the love of many have waxed cold cold because of the cares of the world cool because of different issues in life and they lose focus of why we are born and what we are here to do and what we are here to achieve but we thank God this morning that we uh have a revelation of who we are and whose we are and we have a clear sight of where we want to go and even if we are struggling we are identifying that we are on the journey and nothing is going to take us off of that Journey we might have our ups and our downs but we are pressing on we might fall down sometimes but we are quick to get back up and we are reporting for Duty in the army of the Lord with our souls with our Shields with our breastplates with our with our with our everything we may not win every battle but we know we're gonna win the war because he already settled the war for us we have confidence that we are more than conquerors more than conquerors not just conquerors but more than conquerors so when we come into the house of God we come with a revelation that we are more than conquerors and no demon no devil no sickness no depression no bill no problem no instance no situation the Bible said nothing pass nothing present nothing to come is gonna separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus Hallelujah is the reason we woke up this morning is the reason we sing it's the reason we worship halleluia can the Church Say Amen so I'm under great expectation for what God is going to do and before I get it in a message I came across this Psalm this week and I thought I just it encouraged me and I want to encourage you before we get into the message it may be a familiar scripture to you but I don't know who this is for but it blessed me this week so I trust is going to bless you so if they could help me with Psalms 37 and the Bible says here fret not thyself because of evildoers we have too many Believers threatened so if there's a little bible study this morning is fret not thyself because of evildoers in the Amplified it says do not worry because of evildoers neither be envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb there's so much going around and it's easy to get agitated easy to get stressed easy to get overwhelmed the crime situation this happening and you're living in fear and you're doing this I'm not saying don't be sensitive to what's happening but as Believers we fret not ourselves this is not consuming our every energy it's not consuming our thoughts trust in the Lord and do good that's the instruction so this scripture here is an encouragement with instructions trust in the Lord and do good Hallelujah so shall thou dwell in the land and verily though shall be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord is anybody who is delighting themselves the Lord is your Delight you're just happy when you talk about him you're happy when you're in his presence here when you hear about your lord you feel good when you see somebody blessed you'll feel good all of that is delighting yourself in the Lord is a delight it's a joy it's an excitement to know that the Lord is good to know that he put food on your table whether it's cricks or bread or a beagle it doesn't matter he put food on your table he said I never see my righteous forsaken us oh come on now anybody helped me this morning Delight thyself also in the Lord and the Bible said when you do that and he shall give Thee the desires of thine heart so the desires of thine heart is actually title a delight oh you don't hear me this morning just being excited about the Lord yes in the light of the Lord is connected to the things you're trying to get them you're working to get and you're doing it grudging on you you're stressing and you're straining God is saying just give thanks just be delightful come to church positive don't walk around with a frown put a smile on your face when somebody asks you why you're happy in my delight is in the Lord when somebody say why you why are you moving someone you have a flat tire my delight is in the Lord don't you have 15 reasons to be sad My Delight is in the that's only 22 percent my delight is in the it goes on commit thy way unto the Lord some of us trying to control our way we want to be in charge of our way we want to do good in our way but the Bible says commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth listen he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the Noonday he has taken responsibility for the manifestation of your righteousness and he has taken his place as your judge and he is also your lawyer so he say don't worry I'm your judge and your lawyer your judgment I'm going to take control of your judgment nobody has the right to sentence you because I am your judge anybody with me this morning verse 7 brings a comfort to The Mamas a comfort to the purpose rest in the Lord is that system Asylum God bless you Sister masala so good to see you no stranger from the house welcome home God bless you verse seven rest in the Lord you know people in life they can't get rest people that sleep under the restaurant there's a difference between sleep and rest he could sleep and wake up tired because you didn't get rest but if you rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospered in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass some of us looking at other people and what's going on and you're you're fighting a song and you don't even know what the end is David have you considered the end you're watching them are you complaining what you're doing on the end but I know the thoughts I have for you say at the Lord thoughts of peace to give you an expected end can the church say Amen anybody happy to be a Christian this morning despite the ups and the downs and the child and the testing to know that he made a way where there seemed to be no way he opened doors when the when you didn't know where to go you saw a door when you didn't know how to get her there was a window when you didn't know how to turn you didn't know anything it just worked out God making a way for you oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm still reading in the sound listen we haven't started the service yet we haven't bought it a plane yet we're just in the in the waiting room to board the plane this is the pre-flight instructions can the Church Say Amen verse 8 says cease from anger and forsake Wrath anybody angry this morning well this had to be speaking to somebody so so the fact is saying sis he selling somebody to stop it so maybe the person didn't say that identified himself he says from hunger and for Sacred Heart forsake me the trait away go pick it up again leave her out outside the door you know how much things this morning my wife said to me I find you relax this morning she said you preacher this morning it's happening relax I say for the last few days I make a decision to not let anything stress mode that's a choice that I make to not let anything because stuff will always come this yes you know whatever make a choice I'm not letting it affect me you know water and dark back there's a scene is it water let flow like water and duck back let's just run off because if you take it all brother punch it does it'll set up your pressure it has get you overwhelmed your car functioning yourself getting a whole thing in your spirit before I could worship but if you just say that is not my problem that's not my problem because the Bible say cassia cares upon Him just as the Casio cares cast all up on him and come to the house of God to worship he just come to Delight in the Lord they come to be in the presence of the Lord you come to make it known that you are a Believer listen I have struggles you don't think about overdraft struggles you don't think any man you read in scripture Elijah had troubles Moses had struggles David had struggles Peter had struggles but they have a testimony when you read Hebrew 11 is by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith Noah by faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith Joshua by faith Whatever batist by praying brother George my field brother punch my friend brother Anthony and by faith you are here this morning with a testimony that you are not going to get knocked down and stay down you're gonna get Knocked Up get back up and one of these days you're not gonna get knocked on no more because your feet will be planted solid on a rock can the church say Amen with a power on the inside that the devil cannot move the devil cannot checked nothing moves you the winds may blow though one thousand Fallen that side and ten thousand on the other side I shall not be moved can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a shout out praise [Music] amen amen so can we stand to our feet as we approach a scripture for a little exhortation this morning and what a blessing I want to salute brother Stephen for the exhortation last Friday you appreciate God servant and all the services the team the incorn writer plead last Wednesday and remember last Sunday I don't know what to say that was that a tremendous tremendous blessing I appreciate the message last Sunday and I can just keep going back and going back and but every serve is such a mighty time in the Lord So reading Ezekiel 36 or familiar scripture Ezekiel 36 and reading verse 22 therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this for your sakes in other words the action I'm about to take is not just because of you or House of Israel but for mine holy namesake in other words the action I'm taking is because of me not even because of you because my name is important to me my promises are important to me my word is important to me and my declaration concerning my people is so important to me that even though my people fall down I have to do certain things because I said it and because I chose you and because I predestinated you let's go but for mine Holy Name six which you have profaned Among the Hidden whether he went in other words you have lived among the Heathen and you have brought shame to my name but I'm still doing something because my name is important to me and not because you went to your job or you went to your family and you do something that caused a reproach against my name doesn't stop me from taking action to change course verse 23 and I will sanctify my great name because my name will be clean my name will be pure my name will be recognized there will come a time that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that by this name anybody with me this morning and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned Among The Hidden which ye he's speaking to Israel now have profane in the midst of them in other words your actions your words your deity speaking to Israel have bought hurt to the cause and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you so the same vessels that were used to cause profane he say I'm gonna sanctify in you before their eyes so the same world that see you one way will start to see you another way and it'll be my doing not by might nor my power but I am going to live in you can the church say Amen can we go on a little bit for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you oh for sprinkling this morning of clean water clean water this morning so that all the filthiness of yesterday and the filthiness of last week and the filthiness of our thoughts and our emotions and actions verse 26 a new heart also will I give you Hallelujah and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord Hallelujah a time of cleaning a time of purification a time of change a time of transformation Hallelujah and we have a promise that he will do it there's something that he's going to do there's something that we have to do but the thing that he promised to do oh and I'm so thankful that we can depend on God to do what he said he would do Hallelujah let me ask somebody to help you do something and it doesn't work about when you come to God and it promises when he says he's going to do something he's going to do something and he said he's going to clean us he said he's going to sprinkle clean water upon you Hallelujah if you came in this morning and you have what kind of dirt and cross on you oh thank God for some clean water this morning some clean water of the world to wash us to cleanse our stuff to give your soul in the presence of the Lord that he could walk out of this service today clean Hallelujah nothing against you nothing upon you nothing hindering you nothing holding you back nothing keeping you back from the promise nothing keeping you back from worship you know that's what hinders are worship for a lot of people it's the weight of life and and issues and stuff but if the clean water could just fall upon you and you can know that he is the purifier that you could do so much but when the purification of God comes when the Holy Ghost comes when the rain comes when the showers come oh what a joy what a peace what a satisfaction whether a Blessed Assurance what a delight Hallelujah so I have a title this morning the motives of your heart I want to speak about your heart this morning and a subject a new heart a new spirit and his spirit and an inspiration resolving the conflict between the mind and the Heart resolving the conflict between the mind and the Heart and this is a deep topic a deep subject because it's interesting but Ovid was preaching last week and I was sharing with him as he was speaking all I was seeing was is the issues of the heart the Bible said as a man think in his heart so he is and I want to actually read that shortly so we could see even the context of that verse so we can understand what we're dealing with but the reality is that prodigal son left his house based on what was in his heart the issue with the older brother when he came home was the issue that was in his heart and as you begin to think about this and think about that scripture as a man think in his heart it makes a distinction between what is in your heart and what is in your head because our head controls a lot of our actions but eventually what is in your heart will come out that's why the Bible says as a man think in his heart that's who he really is so in other words you could hear something about somebody you could think you know something on somebody in your heart but if in your heart you'd already like them even if you hear something positive about it you will still respond you can respond nice to know God bless you so that they see you and that's on an intellectual level but in your heart you see in word Israel is just a piece of work because in your heart you have a different thought a different picture a different understanding of that person so when you start to look at it deeper now you see fear come by hearing and hear any word that word is being heard intellectually but everyone speak about mentally and first we catch mental faith but until that mental Faith becomes spiritual fate it still stays here and this is where the great battle is fought so many Believers when you understand why somebody backslide many times because they never had it in their heart you know it was a head understanding all along because if it is in your heart nothing could really shake your heart so I'll share it with my wife the other day my daughter wants to carry a toy to school we say no you're not carrying it you're not carrying it because when you carry it you're not sure you're coming back when the evening came she bringing it toy back bringing it back so all they talk about don't carry towards all intellectual enough she here she processed it she analyzed it but she stuffed the toy in her bag because it was in her heart and he began to realize and I want to drill down a little bit into this thing here now we're gonna get somewhere because we're going to get a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit but I want to address this issue because there's this conflict that exists between the mind and the heart that if you don't understand it you wouldn't understand why you go through what you go through when you tell a child to study your school work they can pass the exam it is not that they don't understand that intellectuality but in the heart it will resonate it is also the reason why people Succeed in Business and in life without all the intellectual because it's in their heart to achieve they may lack the intellectual knowledge to do it they may like the schooling to do at the University to agree to do it but in the heart nothing can change you tell them you can't make it what's driving them is the heart so this issue of resolving conflict is a good and a bad thing because when there's a real when when you begin to water the seed the word seed in your soul that also begins to create a conflict between your heart and your soul and your mind you know because the real believer is the word in you you know so there's always going to be this war between your mind and your heart but if you could ever get your mind and your heart to align if you shall see to this mountain we move and don't doubt in your in other words if you get your mind and your heart in alignment then things begin to move so if you came to chill this morning because you decided to come but your heart not really here you're not getting anything could we drive a little bit so it's done to your motives I'll come to church because I want them to think any no that's all here you know you already come because you're one God but if you come and you're made up your mind to come this morning but in your heart you really want to change then when there's an alignment no you're processed you will a certain way and when he would come to you it could keep dropping from mental Faith to spiritual Faith you receive it to me you hear it you're process it and you receive it wholeheartedly in your heart but if in your heart you can't take this brother is that Christian this morning boy then your dial only filter or your turn on the filter whichever way is process it so now you're filled in so because your heart have an issue yeah anybody with me this morning that's what everybody say guard your heart because out of your heart become all the issues of life notice a real thing and people and and a good example is speaking I just sharing something with you before we get into your service right that older brother last week didn't know what was in his heart until younger brother came home so God sent a work in a situation in your life to expose what is in your heart because you could think one thing mentally you could think you know how you will behave you could think you understand how to deal with something until something comes your way and then what is in your heart begin to reveal itself anybody with me can somebody say Amen this morning [Applause] so we're speaking about motives you're speaking about your heart we speaking about why some people struggle to live a holy life because your mind and what you process intellectual is a doorway to your soul is a gateway so you feed in yourself with movies and certain music and certain conversations you actually could be expanding that conflict because if there's a seed in your soul that desires the truth and desired Holiness and desires the Holy Ghost but you are not feeling it and aligning these things together then you will never you'll never overcome and you'll always be in a frustrated conflict that's why I say to young people you can never enjoy the world you could never enjoyed the world because this seed in your soul is always in conflict with your intellectual conception with life you're trying to live out there you will never be happy because you are designed differently you are built differently can the church say Amen so what we are fighting for is an alignment of what is in your mind and in your heart and every service this word is coming to feed your soul and if you receive it inwardly I let it drop down and say yes that's mine even though you don't understand it so we say yes you're going to get the Holy Ghost yes they're going to get and you believe it and that seed started Rejoice is that again you're gonna overcome I'm gonna clean you your house is going to be delivered your farm is going to change you can live above sin a man can live in such way but a man who said that the devil don't know what to do with him [Music] let the weak say I'm strong that itself is a leap of your mind and your heart so let's go on I would have read this sometime before but I want you to understand this within the context of this issue of the heart behind every action there's a motive and motivation let me read it first here in in Proverbs 23 and I want to let me get it quickly in the Amplified as well when those sitters to eat with a ruler considered diligently what is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if there will be a man given to appetite any Amplified when you sit down to die with a ruler consider carefully what is set before you for you will put a knife to your throat if you are a man of great appetite verse 3 be not desirous of his deities for they are deceitful meat we're building something description of the reference Allah but I want you to see the context it says here do not desire his Delicacies for it is deceptive food offered to you with questionable motives and then it goes into verse four I don't know who this is for but labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom in the Amplified do not worry yourself with the overwhelming desire to gain wealth cease from your own understanding of it verse 5. well thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle to what heaven in the Amplified when you set your eyes on wealth it is suddenly gone for wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that flies into heaven verse 6 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his deity meets in other words in the Amplified do not eat the bread of a selfish man or desire his Delicacies and this is where we get that verse for as he thinketh in his heart so is he verse 7 for as he thinks in his heart so is he in Behavior one who manipulates eat and drink see it he to thee but his heart is not with thee for he thinks in his heart so he says eat and drink yet his heart is not with you but it is begrudging the cost no no he giving food but he's saying how much his thing costs because he already want to give you but it's showing here because we use this scripture a lot as a man thinking his heart to his Heath but I want you to see the thinking in his heart back is really about emotive his desire and I want us to look deeper because everything that is affected in our lives is driven by what's in our heart conflicts people working people doing this when and they've been driven by motives that is not in alignment with what God wants for you I am not saying it is the word saying it behind every action is a more to be and every word is a motive what is your motive to is it in Courage is it is it to be a better Christian is it a serve God is it to live this message is it to be pure is it to be truthful it's to be holy motive is the reason why so I mean so many motive of your heart the reason why the action may be good but the motive could be wrong so we see somebody here giving food but the motive is whatever it is and in the heart they already want to feed you do we really have true motives or is it we need a sprinkling of water Upon Our Hearts no wonder because he realizes they say your heart could get corrupted that's why these psalmist David can say create in me uh you see where it begins to connect now so David was looking at himself and he said wait a minute there's some issues in my heart when somebody can't take a record from the world that is not intellectual they could hear they can always write you know but you feel aware about that feeling is an intellectual think about it the pastor correction somebody says something to you or say that is wrong you should not do it 99.99 of the times you know what was said is correct you know but I feel better here and then he said the finals I like how he tell me that's not intellectual that is the heart jealousy is not an intellectual thing friends it's a heart Envy is that intellectual it's a hard matter lust is that intellectual it's a hard matter we have an agreement that the mind is a Battleground it's fear game for battle they ask the prophet what to do and yet a white dog or he says a fight is wet on your feet you you know that right so we understand that the mind is a Battleground we're not dealing with the Mind here this morning we're dealing with what you allow into your heart so many Bible says receive not an accusation against an elder that's not an intellectual you know who that's receive in your heart because your mind is not a really a reception that sin is a processor it is taking inputs from around you and making a determination about your character and your nature because who you are is not your intellect that breaks up into pieces but who you are is what's in your heart [Music] that's your nature that's your being that's your character so we are contending for the motive and even Paul say people preach and they came to Paul we read this scripture before in Philippians 1. are you riding with me this morning I'm gonna come I'm going to come into your house just now don't worry let's Circle and let's land in Philippians they brought an issue here Paul is writing Paul and timothyus the Servants of Jesus Christ this is Philippians 1 1 to all the sins in Christ Jesus with the Bishops and the deacons so he's writing to the entire church Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God upon every remembrance of you I love scriptures like this do you thank God every time you remember these Saints oh I love these scenes I just so happy about this saying that thank God that I'm part of the body of Believers and these Saints who are on this journey with me I know I'm not the only one struggling but we're all struggling together but I thank God I'm not alone because he didn't just call me there are others who are called also and there are others who are part of tasty Harvest is plentiful Deliver us are few but for the few laborers we have an opinion we are fighting with Aviation Ground God I thank you I thank you for the pastor I thank you for the ministers I thank you for the Deacons I can't give a sister their sister this but it is that's Paul he said I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mind for you all making requests for joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ so God is still working on us and Paul is saying I'm confident and we are confident this morning that he who started his journey with you is more than able to bring it to pass he promised to never leave you he promised and never forsake you he promised to be with you even in you he promised you a new heart he promised you a new spirit he promised you his spirit listen to Paul making now that distinction here and I want to say begin to become more sensitive because it supplies on your job it applies in your school there are people on your job who Intel you're here and I'm talking nice and then here somebody say well you know behind me back they really say and so on so because what they said to you was in their mind they prepared it was a PPN speech but when you're not there what in the heart really show up but I like that I like him and he both think I like him I like him and he's your heart you understand how much your brain is a filter you look at a child my daughter said something about me this morning I can't repeat and it's because you have a filter she's trying to say I looking big but she didn't quite say it like that how she could tell me I look like a dumpling and it's because you'd have a filter yet now as she gets older she's three years old I said you start to learn new you can see that you know afterwards what starts happening you start to think it but you don't say it because your mind filtering but what she is processing is in our little world and the reality is this is what it is after a while when there is no filter on you only your heart speaks on them so when people come to church it's a filtered version you see in here this morning people filter their dress but with Audi filter people take no filter there's a social mediator no filter we had this whole no filter means the real you then the real person that nobody really has seen are taking a no filter and the real you is what in your heart now if you're real you it's not a real Christian then what we've seen is a filtered version of a fake Christian and in no filter version is you with your makeup with your pants on with your with your drinking and your swing on your does it know or you're just you're lost in jealousy and every whatever form that takes no performance because you have nobody to impress somebody filter makes you anybody with me I still reading the scripture hear this don't know how I get there verse seven this is Paul still speaking and dealing with this issue of mind and heart and resolving this conflict even in verse 7 as it is meet for me to think this of you all in other words Paul is saying even though it is appropriate it is fit for me to think this thing about you all listen it goes deeper because I have you in my heart so it's not just an intellectual thing for Paul he's saying it's not just a thinking about you I already have only in my heart so when somebody say listen pray for the pastor that's intellectual until you catch because a burden is not intellectual a burden is a movement of the mind to the heart can I connect Digger deeper somebody said pray for me pray for the city and somebody say sure we praying we respond in prayer is that in an intellectually sponsored as a heart response I want to ask the question again somebody say well remember me in prayer and so make sure I remember in prayer that initial response thank you very Terrace because we already pray for somebody you have to step into their shoes and that's not an intellectual thing that means there's a heart and you really catch a burden Lord if it was me if it was my son if it was my daughter if it was my wife if it was my business if it was my house oh God all of a sudden the perspective changes from an intellectual to because in your heart the heart is where the real connection between us lives they see German you is the same sauce as you see German me so when it comes to the heart now the connection becomes deeper connection and you feel for your brother you feel for your sister instead of working well as previously Brothers pray for you know how much how long you pray all glory I want to move away from this intellectual casual responses because this issue of being a real heart issue brother only when we listen to the message some weeks ago he was making a reference and I said listen when somebody end up in adultery it's not that they don't know she's not a mind issue it's a hard problem when somebody lies nobody lies without knowing is a lie so the issues that in knowledge is that the intellectual issue is a heart issue and it is a seed in you that see the sin don't do it you're hurting me because that's not my nature but the problem speaks about after a while people silence The Voice the voice I tell you don't do this and don't do this and don't do this The Voice starts her after wearing voice get shot up so much he stopped talking and there's no more voice of warning there's no more voice telling you you know you're doing the wrong thing oh God don't let us lose sensitivity to that still small voice try to get us to Calvary and then on to the rapture can the Church Say Amen I'm still in this verse here you have to forgive me I even get into the message I just didn't hear the silver seven even as it meant for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds so even though he in bondage and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel ye are all partakers of my grace in other words where I'm in bondage or not we are all participating in this thing for God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ and this I pray that you'll love me abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment so in other words every service we're supposed to be growing in knowledge and in all judgment and by judgment there it means our ability to discern and make proper decisions in other words every week we're supposed to be getting stronger better as Christians as Fathers as mothers as Sons as daughters as believers every service is a different class form one from two from three every service is a different class of you getting more refined and the mistakes and the issues you made a week ago two weeks ago four weeks ago 12 weeks ago I don't expect it anymore and now you can make more active decisions about silencing when you need to this mind and feed his heart verse 10. that listen because verse 9 there's a semi colon is that a semicolon right after all judgment in other words the sentence is not finished that email approve in other words all of this is so that you may approve things that are excellent in other words when something comes to you to approve you only approving things that are that he may be sincere sincerity is a hard thing sincerity is a no filter thing I won't admittee real you this is a deep thing you know your cousin's coming over so you have to behave yourself why the behave yourself when it was not there in other words the parents teach your children put on a filter but over coming over here so you know what that means and then people start to move things around shift things around adjust things why filter approve all things that are excellent that he may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God but I word that ye I would you should understand Brethren that the things which happen to me have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the Gospel so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and all other places in other words all the things that are happening is only extending this gospel so don't be bothered when things happen Don't Be Shaken when things happen because the gospel is being preached and verse 14 and many of the brethren in the Lord Works in Confident by my bones in other words they see in me in bondage they're seeing me keeping my head up they're seeing me not crying and frustrated they are being encouraged it's an encouragement friends when you are in a struggle and to make it see yourself standing it's an encouragement I look at Bella Terence is the Jenny here Michael their son my cousin is in hospital they gotta be home crying but they hear test they found any goodness of the Lord here in faith looking for God to perform a miracle that before the doctor could even operate the Holy Ghost will perform a surgery it's an encouragement to see them in the house of the Lord and many of us have testimonies and they're people who are not here who have no excuse you know why it's not in the heart to be here friends I'm not saying to have legitimate punch legitimate strong 100 excuse but why are you not here with a weak excuse you have a flimsy issues that can't work nowhere else because you're showing what in your heart because even in your heart to be in the house your lord you'll be here anybody with me see that kind of rough Brothers but it's true people make excuses for stuff because they're trying to cover up what really in their heart and when they get caught in it as well it's just a little thing it's a whole thing it's a little thing but it's really your heart Lord creating me a clean heart you know it must be in your heart what your heart has is what you will live out let's get back I keep getting pulled away from the sea many of the brethren in the Lord waxing Confident by my bonds so when you're in trouble it's an encouragement to somebody when you still serve the Lord people drawstring from it so don't think well because I'm in trouble and my break my foot I want to come no come with the broken foot let us see it coming because some minutes I don't say look if he committed broken foot but my my foot I break what I what is my excuse Paul saying they're waxing Confident by my bones they're here in prison lock up and because they're in prison still preaching they're feeling good the preacher on the street they are much more bold to speak the word without fear that's what Paul's saying there and now it goes deeper coming to the issue of the heart some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also of Goodwill so Paul's saying they're preaching but no in the heart is because the Nvidia Ministry they have strive there like how I deal with this and how I deal with it but some doing it for Goodwill too you know the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely so it is dessert Discerning it supposing to add Affliction to my bones so he's saying their brothers preaching with an intention to hurt me while I'm in prison this is Paul star in the right hand of God messenger for the first age acknowledging ministers out there preaching to cause him hurt verse 17 but the other of love knowing that I'm set for the defense of the Gospel so the other preaching of love knowing where my heart is what then in other words he's saying what is that then in other words notwithstanding everywhere whether in pretense or in truth crisis preach and I do daring and I daring to Rejoice yea and Will Rejoice so he's saying I'm not going to let that bother me I'm not even gonna let enmity come into my heart again those brothers who doing it out of Envy because I want to keep my heart pure so because Christ is being preached I Will Rejoice I will sit in his service and lift my hand on worship because it is happy that God gets in the glory anybody with me this morning motive drives us what is the motive for the way you dress for the way you speak for the way you conduct yourself in your home the way you speak to your children the way you speak to your parents the way you speak to your friends the way you operate in church all of it stems from your heart it speaks of your deeper desires what are you feeding your heart what do you feed in your spirit what are you doing to draw yourself closer to God not intellectually now but in your heart what this message is calling for is a move from an intellectual I believe the message to my happy and change and a recognition of the need for your heart to be changed and that's why I read the scripture in Ezekiel a new heart I'll give you I'll put my spirit in there I'll give you a new spirit and then put my spirit in there and that's what I want all of us to live our lives know and listen I need a new heart I need a new spirit and I need his spirit and brother Branham taught us many people mix up that new spirit with the Holy Spirit he said it's not the same thing he said the new spirit is to be compatible with the Holy Spirit because your spirit can't even gets along with your wife he said that's in a message but when I give you a new spirit now that Spirit now is agreeable and that she is now compatible is that the same operating system so I think if you're operating system to receive the Holy Spirit can the Church Say Amen as we get closer to God we need to look more and more at our actions and our motives because our words God sees beyond the words we can fool one another with what we say you know we could even fool one another with what we see but who you really are is what's in your heart and a closer walk with God is really about your heart getting right with God let me say that one more time a close-up many people say I'm on a closer walk with God and you're ready to want to change your behavior and what I'm talking about here this morning is not what people see is what people don't see and that's a deeper message of this gospel it's a change that makes your life consistent across the board you know what they said about brother randomly couldn't tell us enemies from his friends because he was consistent across the board that's who I want to be consistent across the board not I'm a Christian on a Sunday and by Monday is a tyrant by Friday forget it I need to be re-baptized because make it back to Sunday service but your behavior now is one of Charity of love Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness living on oozing out of your heart not a mental not breathing for that you breathe in not an intellectual thing and you know every one of these virtues could be impersonated intellectually natural patience man just patient he just he never moving he's just patient he want to work he's patient so many patience of God which is a spiritual thing not an intellectual thing so this message for many people is an intellectual thing I'm not going to be too long with you but as Believers if you really want to grow in god grow in life you have to really want a high change and when your heart is change and you'll see everything else in your life begins to change I share this part in a Bible study when we look closely at our lives they are really only two things that affect us words and actions all of our challenges issues and frustrations come from our failure to understand motives how many arguments in your home could be avoided if you pause to understand the motive how many conflicts in your job could be mitigated if you pause to understand the motive how much trouble would you have avoided if you pause to consider the motive before you took a certain action because action is still a decision so your heart triggers a thought the thought is triggers an a decision or an action or a word and sometimes we just allow this to override this and something we allow this to take control of this so our desires Believers is to bring this mind now on the subjection and keep feeding this habit the word so out of your heart flaws the abundance of your heart the mouth speaks that that's it because you had it down so full of life until so you can only see a thing because your heart is not bubbling you're overwhelmed your heart's so Joy you're hard to Abundant that you can only speak the Praises you can always speak about the Delight you're so happy you're speaking positive over your children you're not in trouble but look at God in Ezekiel is he go to his sin I know all your profane my name I'm not even doing it for yourself my sake because my name is important I am willing to overlook what you have done because I need to protect my name my name are protected but also because in my name they're casting on devils in my name they will speak a new tongues in my name the enemy will scatter for my name's sake I will deliver you for my name's sake I will clean you up another speak last week that father had a choice and hear God the father in Ezekiel is showing the choice he had and he said I know your mess up but I am going to speak I'm going to deliver I'm going to sort it out Lord give us the heart of our true father the heart of a true mother the heart of a new son a true son out of a true daughter can the Church Say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your heart is really who you are who are you this morning who are you really not the intellectual response when Jacob wrestled with the angel and the question was asked who are you he was not in place resume he wasn't asking for the detail of his genealogy and his name he said I'm a Deceiver he was describing the condition of his he was asking who are you really because before I could fix you you have to know and understand who you are really so that's why when many people came they say save me I have sinned I'm a sinner I could see the woman are they well go call your husband her answer was have none she almost answered what Jesus didn't ask you know because she went deeper she could have just said I have none and leave it right there but he said I have one dirty one day I had five under one eleven is not mine and she said to just reveal what was in heart it was like this was a heaviness that was holding her down for a long time and it's like the first time you got to tell somebody who she really was you you you understand the liberty and the freedom that she had when she finally let oh that's it meant how free friends you know how free you are when you could finally release who you are and allow you Holy Ghost to come in and take take this seat of your heart you know what I should be walking around alive with the heaviness and the guilt and the shame and the past and the mistake and as if your carrying this huge weight on your shoulder you have no Outlet no release and you're just there and you're trying to press you and may you leave this service today with our freedom and a shout and that's why the Bible say who this son of man set free is free indeed you don't have to leave in bondage of your past your fears your mistakes today you can leave here shouting jumping on your rooftop and when you get that freedom no devil could ever come back in there can the Church Say Amen there's a few more scriptures could you take some more is this helping anybody Proverbs 16 2. all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the Lord weigh at the spirits and I read it and he Amplified all the ways of a man are clean and innocent in his own eyes and he may see nothing wrong with his actions that's why the word comes but the Lord weighs and examines the motives and intents of the heart and knows the truth anybody with me Jeremiah 17 9. familiar scripture the heart is deceitful Above All Things and desperately wicked who can do it in the Amplified the heart is deceitful above all things and is extremely sick who can understand it fully and know its secret motives friends no wonder that song David said created me a clean heart takes on a whole new meaning because only God could do that operation is there anybody want to leave here this morning Norman call could do our operation on the inner man on the heart this is not the kind of message well I leave learning something new no no no no I don't want you to leave learning nothing new I want to leave with a heart sins so I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I put my spirit inside of there which is the Holy Ghost itself to lead you and to guide you to direct you to be your control tower these are scriptures we have studied we have looked about to remind you because your pathway to the victory that you're looking for is tied to your heart all over their churches and services going on and people hearing information with the currents but change is not just intellectual is a high change Lord this jealousy this jealousy this jealousy have to go Envy malice gossip that's something you're not intellectual problems you can't go to a doctor for it there's no Pharmacy to give you a prescription for jealousy and lust and envy and deceit and deception and manipulation and but these things are real real sickness affecting your life affecting your home affecting your marriage affecting your children binding up prayer binding up the moving of the Holy Ghost yeah oh God a new heart a new spirit the Holy Spirit a new heart a new spirit the holy spirit this old heart is broken this heart is trouble this heart is sick but the Holy Ghost the master the Creator the Lord he is able like David said to create a clean heart created me a clean heart wash it sprinkle clean water clean water over the family clean water over the church I can't stop listening to this kind of music I hope to this thing on the internet you're you're hooked on pornography you're hooked on all kind of filter that's not the intellectual problem that's a hard condition you need to come to the heart doctor you need to come to the heart surgeon you have trouble taking up a lion that's such an intellectual problem degree wouldn't take away the Lion a new service wouldn't take a really lion but if the heart doctor could get permission this morning to operate on your heart yes hatred too yes yes yes odds and grudges oh God help us I never ought find every Grudge find every issue I want to give the Lord permission will you give him permission this morning would you come willingly to the operating theater so he could put on his gown and he can say lay down here allow me to go in as I said take the calls cleanse my lips here I am he understood he said where is me a Montana I'm a man of and that was a prophet how do they want to come to church to to hear something and go back on the net I know I learned something no I want to change I want somebody to say what happened to you what happened to you you're different you're different you're different something change something change you're smiling more feel your energy you could even feel the energy you know they're not with you but all of a sudden oh you're moving so because you went to the heart doctor you went to the heart specialist where's the heart doctor cardiologist is that the right one yeah cardiologists or a heart surgeon and he's able to give you a new one you see I take all this to anyone I'll take it out that one after go if you never had a heart transplant today today's a day to have a hundred he said I want to give you a new heart for him to give you a new one you have to take over your old one he said he wanna have is a stony one but I want to give you a heart of Flesh because only a heart of Flesh could take a new spirit this story [Applause] you may be seated I want to separate I want to resolve the conflict between the mind and the Heart the purpose of the preaching of the gospel because faith comes by hearing and hearing his word so they put you know especially men men don't like to go by the doctor they like to self-medicate yeah they feel it that it threatens their machismo de bravado they're strengthened so then you have to go and talk them and talk them and talk them and talk them and tell them and tell them and tell them and that talk is just like because until they intellectually convinced to go by the doctor only then the doctor could really operate so it's the same principle with mind and heart we are here this morning for people to accept witness I really need to change you know that people don't think they need to change that is a bigger fear you know better punch people who in the message who think because I believe the message here that this change automatically as a result of what happened here because you can believe the message will be leaving us and they're not here anymore even the devil believer not the belief is not the issue is if you will allow the belief to take it to action which is surgery table to shape and mold for the Potter to have permission to touch the clay the whole objective of preaching is to prepare you you ever go about doctor and say well fill out this form never talk to you you're not supposed to eat for two three days before the surgery you don't do this you don't do this that's what this is here you know friends I'm not a surgeon you know I'm not a doctor you know I'm just a nurse the great physician is here this morning to perform surgery I'm just trying to prepare you for whoever wants to go to the room and this surgeon can do multiple people at the same time it's not like man doctor we're talking about he can perform surgery at the same time thank you anybody with me this morning so I'm here to preach faith and Clarity to you so you can say Lord already when we say come to the altar it's not the preacher you're coming to the great surgeon is here the holy spirit is here the great physician is here but you also have to confess and admit Lord Is Lost are coming for it's animosity it's Envy it's worldliness is the fashion of the world it's Disobedience it's a lot of you're not disrespectful to my mother I disrespected my father I wanted out of me don't come up and say Lord bless me you don't go to a whole specialist surgeon for blessing go to the pharmacy for that this surgeon has a knife you're coming to him to cut he not dispensing when you have only cotton garment when he is when he in that portfolio that Ministry he just cutting Stony out and put in flesh inside oh [Applause] intellectually everybody in here knows what it is to be a Christian but you struggle to live it because it's a Stony heart or your heart has been changed but you need a Holy Ghost [Applause] this is not form one standard One Church yes they first see a teaching don't drink gospel to listen to your teaching so why you can't do it it's because you have a medicine I grew up in this thing yeah it's the same message over and over forgive love live holy clean up your life forget the world it's the same thing over and over get ready for the Rapture upon the unclean thing it's the same message seven lit voices seven Thunders adoption Perfection super Church super race it's not new information same message I know voice in the final age statue of a perfect man this being when complete is the being that goes in a rapture is that a new message but we struggle to live it because you haven't allowed the surgeon to cut out the Stony heart to put a new spirit in there and for the Holy Ghost the holy ghosts the step into 16 elements [Music] and he said when the Holy Ghost comes in you it'll make you stop your lion it'll send the devil flying it'll give you power to pray power to forgive power to love power to live a holy life or somebody help me preach this morning [Applause] [Music] sisters don't wear makeup don't cut your hair don't wear pants how much time you want to hear that when you come to church worship God all the worldly friends is there anybody here in this video the first time because if it's the first time then it have to be your first day you're here it was the first day here but if you've been here at any point of time you would have heard this from the god called me that says he has placed in his house who every service and you know what better but I'm said I could preach it I'm blue in your face but I tell us what is inspired to you and inspire me and dropping from mentors it had to move it needs to move it needs to be a movement and listen when this moves [Music] when this thing move when I see people running wrongly building hunting it's because I'm moving that's why as ministers we know when it move we could tell when he touched you we can know when you're met decision we know oh come on now Hallelujah [Applause] you have to forgive me but I am blessed because this is the word this is not my thoughts this is the word of God and I want to see this for me and for you because brother Adam said after you receive the Holy Ghost now you have to make yourself a Christian so it's not as if it's a switch because some of us like this switch thing it just switched on you just walk out and everything no you're a soldier so now you receive the Holy Ghost pick up your sword and fight fight for your family fight for your house fight fight fight fight the maintain your testimony fight listen receiving the Holy Ghost don't make your bills disappear you know it's even new holy ghostly Pastor he passed away may you say it don't clean your house he said you have work to do receiving new Holy Ghost don't don't buy flowers for your wife you still have to make yourself a question and all that in it no don't let me preach this morning all that in it is working no life is work this kingdom is work the Holy Ghost gives you a new control tower it lets you know what to do and what not to do but you're still into work you're still going to pay your bills you still need to go to your job and situation will come because the prophet taught us the devil will test every virtue you claim you have and yes every right to test it you say you have patience and turn only calypso music for you and see how much patience you have put in a traffic jam I see believers somebody struggle with road rage road rage we need to go back to decision they call back what's the number of researchers the doctor does checking up to see how things go into the operation say hey Doc we call any back yes because we have a road rage incident here we need something more and we we we need a Top-Up and that's why when those disciples went every day he said they were refilled with you when he goes the first time any dynamics of this church will be uh refilling the top up Morty spirit anybody with me this morning [Applause] but your car joined this Spirit talk if you have a stone your heart I would love we could talk about you know where any car really talk about it you can talk about it but we really want to talk about it but until you're willing to come and say Lord are broken I really recognize I'm a horrible wife I'm a horrible husband our horrible father I really mess up and I recognize it's a hard problem I have and I want you to perform surgery and cut out the Stony heart give me a new heart so I can start over today you see when I reached that point of Brokenness because Isaiah was not there until he came into the presence of God he wasn't seeing his issues until he was close to the presidency with him I'm a man of unclean what was me the close side came into presence the more he recognized Lord I'm undone daughter was okay I thought I was prophesying fine but I recognized there's some my lips on cleaner say anything that shouldn't be saying I'm a man of unclean lips I need to adjust the words I use take the calls burn it burn it change it I just don't want to be the same whatever you need to do Lord whatever you need to do God wants to bring us to that spot where you say Lord whatever you need to do do it so that I could be permanently changed because listen when is Tony I'll come on CE it's only had this old is a flesh heart is in there it's just new spirit and then his holy spirit next so you need to know where on this journey you are no I'm going to say something here there are people saying Lord I want this spirit and I want to be very clear if your heart tells Tony let me adjust address the process now if your heart change now we can really pray for the Holy Spirit to come unto need or to be new spirit but if you know that's Tony hat in there then today don't you leave without meet any surgeon the musicians can get ready I'm almost done just go a little deeper and I shared this before in a Bible study in James he's speaking he said he asked and this is just to kneel down the need this morning friends to Bear your heart before the Lord prostrate yourself before the Lord forget everything else and say Lord I need help we don't need an extra service you need help from the Lord he said your ass and receive not this is James 4 3. because you ask a miss that he may consume it upon your lusts and he's saying here in the Amplified you ask God for something and you do have receive it because you ask with wrong motives and wrong motive speaker I had a problem motives out of selfishness or with an unrighteous agenda so that when you get what you want you may spend it on your hedonistic desires be something [Music] I'll skip this foreign God is looking for honesty he's looking for sincerity the surgeon is ready this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you every head about every eye closed [Music] I believe this morning God wants to minister to Believers in different ways you have to know where you are at there are those here who you may realize from the word that you have a Stony heart [Music] and what you need is a heart of Flesh here to deal with that this morning the surgeon is here this morning with one purpose as a decision to cut out the Stony heart and to put a heart of Flesh to get that heart of Flesh the random taught us so many times he wants to give you a new spirit he said you can't even get along with yourself the Old Devil Spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so that he could get along with his spirit he said you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with God so he has to give you a new spirit before you get along with him so he puts a news hurt in you then he puts his Spirit In You then he puts his holy spirit there down so maybe you have had a surgery and you have a heart of Flesh and maybe you have not experienced a new spirit he's here for you too this morning you need to know where you fit along this spectrum this morning and maybe you are more advanced and you already tasted an experience and have this spirit and you're looking now for the Holy Spirit he's here to meet you also and maybe you've already received the Holy Spirit and you're looking for a refilling of the Holy Spirit he's here to meet you to this morning so he's here to meet every need every request every situation this morning [Music] but Anthony could begin to understand I want you to begin to talk to the Lord I want you to be honest with the Lord I want you to speak from your heart I want you to forget who's next to you the altar is open I'm not going to call anybody but the altar is open you know if you need to be here rush to the altar and meet decision speak to the surgeon meet the Holy Spirit speak to the angel you need to repent me to make things right today is your day I don't

we ask it amen and amen God bless you we have your seats what a time this morning we certainly appreciate amen the word that's what I enjoy so much that the Brethren the brothers the ministers were just deliver the word they're not here to promote themselves or they won't taught some ideas just to deliver the word that will help your help you as a person because that's where we want to be we want to be better persons and and God search the reins of the heart God tested that young man that's why he left and he went and a far country and God tested his older brother also when he came back and there's some people who can't handle when Baxter has come back they can't handle I'll be talking about the Sheep uh the the one sheep that was a street and they come back on the on the on the shoulder of the shepherd when you get fight with that because that person getting our shoulder right but the point about it that God said he lives in 1909 and go for that one so I pray that God gave you a burden because only those people with the burden could effectively pray and strange enough only those who pray and could get a burden so when you pray you get a burden when they get a burden you pray more if you have no burden you're living for yourself you know you're doing your own thing you're going your own way but you see when you get that spirit that you have recognize the world is not about you watching the mirror it's not about you watching yourself it's not about you you think it's about you it's not about you your deceived thing is all about you it's about God what his will is many people don't even imagine whether it will be five years from now see they don't know they make decisions and choices and things begin to unfold but you've got to put God first and he would bless you and keep you amen so this morning we want to welcome uh Tamika modest I hope I pronounced right from invited by Jose Bautista God bless you welcome to The Headstone Tabernacle we have a priest

that's that's powerful oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God I have a praise you also on the evening of April 20th uh 2023 my son David a police officer twisted his angle while on duty he sent me a picture of this Old Uncle he didn't wear the boots while looking at the picture on the phone the holy spirit said lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover that's your Authority so I just rest my hand on the ankle in the phone and no prayer said I told David that the swelling will go down by the morning and that is what actually happened since I I held on to the promise thank you Jesus

Thanksgiving yesterday it's just good to be in the presence of God and I feel that if we consecrate and dedicate our hearts and lay before God more and more of this presence could unfold and next after afterwards God could be so attracted by by the atmosphere that you are creating that the angel of God could step in and remember I'm talking about he is here I'm waiting on something all of a sudden I say he is here however some things change one time came into a meeting he didn't have the pray he said the angel was present people said they come out of the wheelchair people just have to be
