[10:59] Lord. is done. Let's bow our heads
[11:01] forward of prayer tonight. Heavenly
[11:03] Father, we thank you for guiding us
[11:04] together and we thank you for this great
[11:06] opportunity you have given us to serve
[11:08] you in the final closing hours of time.
[11:12] The time itself runs out. When the angel
[11:14] came down 10, the voice said, "Time
[11:17] shall be no more." Time itself runs out.
[11:21] Help us, Lord, tonight by your word and
[11:24] by your spirit to climb a little higher,
[11:27] to go a little further, to go a little
[11:29] deeper, that we could catch your mind,
[11:31] your intelligence for as for this hour.
[11:34] Granted, God in Jesus name I ask it.
[11:36] Amen and amen. God bless you. Welcome. I
[11:39] trust the Lord that you're doing fine.
[11:41] And I trust the Lord that all your
[11:43] experiences has been to encourage you
[11:46] because the devil job is to bring great
[11:49] discouragement, depression and
[11:50] frustration. And once it gets into that
[11:53] discouraging tend to lose faith and you
[11:56] know as the prophet says just as fate uh
[11:59] send away sickness and so on, unbelief
[12:01] will bring it right back. And you have
[12:03] to hold your grounds. You have to hold
[12:06] and maintain your grounds at grounds of
[12:08] faith. Tonight I have something special
[12:10] I like to share with you tonight and the
[12:12] scripture I have is from Exodus chapter
[12:14] 6 want to read from 1 to8. Exodus
[12:18] chapter 6 reading from 1 to8. It reads
[12:24] thus. Then the Lord said unto
[12:27] Moses, "Now shalt thou see what I shall
[12:32] do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand
[12:36] shall he let them go, and with a strong
[12:39] hand shall he drive them out of his
[12:43] land." And God spake unto Moses, and
[12:46] said unto him, I am the Lord. And I
[12:50] appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, unto
[12:53] Jacob, by the same the name of God
[12:57] Almighty. But by my name Jehovah, was I
[13:00] not known to them. And I have also
[13:03] established my covenant with them to
[13:06] give them the land of Canaan, the land
[13:08] of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
[13:11] strangers. And I have also heard the
[13:15] groaning of the children of Israel, whom
[13:18] the Egyptians keep in
[13:20] bondage, and I have remembered my
[13:23] covenant.
[13:25] Wherefore say unto the children of
[13:28] Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring
[13:31] you out from under the burdens of the
[13:34] Egyptians, and I will rid you out of
[13:37] their bondage, and I will redeem you
[13:40] with a stretched out arm, and with great
[13:43] judgments, and I will take you to me for
[13:48] a people, and I will be to you a God,
[13:52] and he shall know that I am the Lord.
[13:54] your God, which bringeth you out from
[13:57] under the burdens of the Egyptians. And
[13:59] I will bring you into unto the land
[14:03] concerning which I swear to give to
[14:06] Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I
[14:09] will give it to you, give it to you from
[14:11] heritage. I am the Lord. May God bless
[14:14] his word. And this is such a inspiring
[14:20] scripture and how God choose to
[14:23] introduce himself. He said, "I am the
[14:26] Lord." That
[14:28] statement separates the Lord from every
[14:31] false god and
[14:33] idol. It defines and declares identity,
[14:37] who he is. It defines his authority.
[14:42] Thou shalt see what I shall do unto
[14:46] Pharaoh. It
[14:48] defines his sovereignity over nations
[14:52] and people. Now, could you imagine how
[14:55] angry and upset God is when you see
[14:58] people worshiping idols of stone, of
[15:00] wood, of gold, of car, of man and woman
[15:04] and beast and whatever it is when he
[15:06] know that is foolishness.
[15:09] The first thing he said, I am the
[15:13] Lord. So it define who he is over nation
[15:17] and
[15:18] people. And he shall know that I am the
[15:20] Lord which bringeth you from under the
[15:23] burdens of the
[15:26] Egyptians. And this word struck me and
[15:29] you shall
[15:31] know. And this you shall know comes by
[15:35] act of
[15:36] deliverance,
[15:38] restoration or
[15:40] judgment. God by mighty acts of judgment
[15:45] or deliverance or
[15:47] restoration make the people to know who
[15:51] is
[15:52] God. And it struck me that God is going
[15:56] to make himself known, not just to us,
[16:00] not just to the church, not just to his
[16:03] people, but to the entire
[16:05] world. Look at this scripture here in
[16:08] Joel 2 when he begin to describe, be
[16:11] glad then anything of Zion, rejoice in
[16:13] the Lord, for he given unto you the
[16:15] former raid moderately. So he's
[16:17] prophesying what is going to happen. He
[16:19] will cause to come down for you to rain
[16:22] the former rain, the latter rain in the
[16:24] first month. So you don't have to doubt
[16:26] because he going to do it. And the floor
[16:28] shall be full of wheat and the fat shall
[16:31] overflow with wine and oil. And I will
[16:33] restore to you the years that the locust
[16:36] had eaten, the cankerworm, and the
[16:37] caterpillar and the palm worm. My great
[16:39] armies I sent among you, and he shall
[16:41] eat prophecy in plenty and be satisfied.
[16:44] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[16:46] that address wonders with you and my
[16:49] people shall never be ashamed. And here
[16:53] the hear the scripture now. And ye shall
[16:55] know that I am in the midst of Israel
[16:59] and I am the Lord and none else and my
[17:02] people shall never be ashamed. You know
[17:04] years I keep preaching and teaching that
[17:06] this message world have not seen
[17:08] judgment
[17:09] yet. They have not seen God's hands of
[17:12] wrath and
[17:14] vengeance. I said something that spit
[17:16] out my mouth on Sunday came
[17:18] out that God will remove some completely
[17:22] off the chessboard and leave some to
[17:24] demonstrate his judgment.
[17:28] So these acts of God are the means by
[17:34] which God shows himself to nations, the
[17:38] peoples and tongues. This will be
[17:42] seen. This will be known. God will
[17:47] declare himself that the people may
[17:50] know. So don't think for one moment this
[17:53] God is bash ashful and shy and he's
[17:56] hiding somewhere he don't want to get
[17:59] himself out there to be known. No that
[18:02] the world may know he is intent on
[18:05] making himself known to the entire
[18:07] world. So the title of this exhortation
[18:09] tonight is deliverance restoration or
[18:13] judgment that the people may know that I
[18:16] am the Lord.
[18:18] Look how he declares his judgment on
[18:21] nations. The first nation, just a few
[18:24] examples I want to give you to get on
[18:26] what we're in, is Moab. Ezekiel
[18:29] 25:11, he says this, "And I will execute
[18:32] judgments upon Moab, and they shall know
[18:36] that I am the
[18:37] Lord upon the Philistines." Ezekiel 25:1
[18:41] 16. Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord God,
[18:44] behold, I will stretch out my hand upon
[18:46] the Philistines. I will cut off the ter
[18:49] the cherithims and destroy the remnant
[18:52] of the sea coast. And I will execute
[18:54] great vengeance upon them with furious
[18:57] rebukes and they shall know that I am
[19:00] the Lord when I shall lay my vengeance
[19:02] upon them. Zidon Ezekiel 28
[19:07] 21-23. Solomon set thy face against
[19:10] Zidon. prophesy against it and say,
[19:13] "Thus sayeth the Lord God, behold, I'm
[19:16] against thee, O Zidon, and I will
[19:18] glorist listen. and I will be glorified
[19:21] in the midst of thee, and they shall
[19:24] know that I am the Lord, when I shall
[19:26] have executed judgments in her, and be
[19:29] sanctified in her, and I will send into
[19:32] her pestilence, and blood into her
[19:35] streets, and the wounded shall be judged
[19:37] in the midst of her by the sword upon
[19:40] every on every side, and they shall know
[19:43] that I am the Lord.
[19:45] So I'm showing you here and this is this
[19:48] is it has much more but I just example
[19:50] here three examples that God sees
[19:54] himself being glorified being identified
[19:59] being sanctified through judgment upon
[20:02] peoples upon nations upon lands. In
[20:06] Elijah's time the people were
[20:09] backsiden and we know the story. I'm
[20:11] just going to read a little part of the
[20:12] scripture. When Elijah talk about if God
[20:16] is God serve him and he put a challenge
[20:18] to Bal and all the worshippers and so on
[20:20] and we know what Elijah did he put the
[20:22] wood in order cut the bullet in pieces
[20:24] and he filled four barrels of water pour
[20:28] it upon the bird sacrificing on the wood
[20:30] because what was the story what was the
[20:32] challenge led to God that answer by fire
[20:33] not coats everybody had the coats
[20:35] everybody have books everybody had tapes
[20:37] but fire now and he says pour water on
[20:41] the burnt sacrifice on the wood He said,
[20:43] "Do it a second time." This is a second
[20:46] time. He said, "Do it a third time." Did
[20:48] it a third time. And the water ran round
[20:50] about the altar, and he filled the
[20:52] trench also with water. And it came to
[20:54] pass at the time of the offering of the
[20:56] evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet
[20:58] came near, and said, "This is his
[21:00] prayer. Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[21:02] of Israel, let it be known this day that
[21:05] thou art God in Israel, that I am thy
[21:09] servant, and that I have done all these
[21:12] things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord.
[21:15] Hear me, that this people may know that
[21:19] thou art the Lord God, and that thou has
[21:22] turned their heart back again. So this
[21:26] was a restoration here by manifestation.
[21:30] And the Bible said to verse 38, the
[21:32] fire, then the fire of the Lord fell and
[21:35] consumed the burn sacrifice and the wood
[21:39] and the stones and the dust and lick up
[21:43] the water that was in the trench. And
[21:45] when all the people saw it, they fell on
[21:48] their face and they said, "The Lord, he
[21:52] is the God. The Lord, he is the God."
[21:56] When the people saw it, not heard it,
[22:00] but saw it, it was God demonstrating his
[22:04] power through that Elijah prophet. And
[22:07] the people had to confess the Lord, he
[22:10] is the God. And I'll close off this
[22:12] portion here with one more. I think we
[22:15] struck it on on Sunday. And Nars and
[22:18] Safy and we know the story. And Peter
[22:22] said, "Why had Satan filled thy heart to
[22:24] lie to the Holy Ghost concerning the
[22:26] piece of land?" He asked them, "Is it
[22:28] worth the full price?" And they said,
[22:30] "Yes, it was a lie. Why it remained? Was
[22:32] it not thine own after it was sold? Was
[22:35] it not in thine own power? Why hast thou
[22:38] conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou
[22:40] has not lied unto men, but unto God." So
[22:43] here was the axe church. Here was the
[22:46] church in action, the bride church in
[22:47] action. This was beyond books and tapes.
[22:50] They had none of that. Then this was be
[22:52] unwritten. This was living word. This
[22:55] was living God in a people being made
[22:59] manifest. And as hearing these words
[23:01] fell down, give up the ghost. Great fear
[23:04] came on all them that heard these
[23:06] things. His wife came in. You know what
[23:08] happened to her? And at the ending, she
[23:11] fell straight away at her feet, at his
[23:12] feet, yielded up the ghost. Young men
[23:14] came in, found a dead barrier for buried
[23:17] her by her husband. And great fear came
[23:20] upon all the church and upon as many as
[23:23] heard these things. So this is what I
[23:27] try to introduce to you now that this is
[23:29] going to repeat this going to happen.
[23:32] God making himself known that I am the
[23:36] Lord. It's like him declaring himself
[23:39] amidst all the gods the mini G's amidst
[23:42] all the idols amidst all the
[23:44] denomination and those are also idols
[23:46] people worshiping their churches and
[23:48] their ministry and ministers and
[23:49] different things like that amidst all
[23:51] that idolatry God could come down and
[23:54] say I am the Lord I'm going to prove
[23:55] that to you but Brandham familiar quote
[23:58] when a church is groaning because you
[24:00] say I've heard the cries of my
[24:03] people believing on the Lord Jesus that
[24:05] the promise of the Holy Ghost just as
[24:07] real as it was to Pentecost. And I hope
[24:09] you don't get fed up tired me hearing
[24:10] preaching this and saying this because
[24:11] this is a promise. How they grown and
[24:14] cry on labor pains. But when they born
[24:17] and positionally born, God set the
[24:19] church in order. Nature itself is
[24:21] groaning. All the world is groaning.
[24:24] Waiting for what? For the manifestations
[24:26] plural of the sons of God. Waiting for
[24:29] the church to get back in its place
[24:32] again. Sons of God to be made manifest.
[24:36] waiting for that hour. I hope that don't
[24:38] hurt. I just had to say it. The church
[24:40] is so far away from its place. It needs
[24:43] to be back to be sons and daughters
[24:45] again, rulers, governors of the earth
[24:48] under the spiritual reign. It will be
[24:49] someday when the chief one comes. Jesus
[24:52] Christ nature is grown. And I'm going to
[24:56] close familiar quote. The bride has no
[24:58] revival as yet. There'll be no revival
[25:01] there. No manifestation of God to the
[25:02] bride. You're looking for it. It will
[25:04] take those seven thunders get to wake
[25:06] her up again. He will send it one to he
[25:09] promised it. So he will send it. He
[25:11] promises. But this is the part I want to
[25:12] get to. Now if the churches would forget
[25:15] their creeds, forget their dogmas and
[25:17] take the Bible and keep the promises.
[25:20] And if you check out all the false
[25:21] doctrines have now in this message,
[25:23] they're only quoting and twisting and
[25:25] and kneading like flour and putting
[25:28] their own yeast and interpretation and
[25:30] they making a good bake and giving the
[25:32] people and serving them to eat. But it
[25:34] it have addition inside of there. But he
[25:37] say if they could take the Bible because
[25:38] what the prophet came to do is to reveal
[25:40] the Bible. So whatever he says have to
[25:42] be able to slide back in the scriptures.
[25:44] A lot of doctrine and teachings it could
[25:46] hang in the message and they could they
[25:48] could play what I call verbal verbal
[25:50] gymnastics with it in the message. But
[25:52] they cannot play verbal gymnastics in
[25:54] the Bible. So if it cannot come true
[25:56] from Genesis to revelation, it's it's
[25:58] time to throw it out. If they will take
[26:00] the Bible and plead the promise, he said
[26:02] then it will become effective to them.
[26:05] But Jesus said you with your tradition
[26:08] make the word of none effect. So we want
[26:10] to pray tonight but we want it to be
[26:12] effective. So that is why in a couple of
[26:14] the prayer services we talk about
[26:15] dropping yours. If you have something
[26:17] the altar make it right. Why? Because we
[26:19] want your prayer go through. We don't
[26:20] want your prayer stuck on the roof,
[26:22] stuck by your chair or chucked by a
[26:24] table wherever you sitting or kneeling
[26:25] tonight. But we want your prayer to go
[26:27] straight up to heaven and glory. But a
[26:29] Brandon says he says when a man made God
[26:32] what he said while he was pray okay
[26:34] there was a old man one time that he
[26:36] wouldn't he couldn't make up his mind
[26:38] the devil kept beating him out of it one
[26:40] day out the cornfield. So he's getting
[26:42] licks in his mind and one day in the
[26:44] cornfield he needed to pray while he was
[26:46] praying he drove down a stub whatever
[26:48] that is stick it down on the ground and
[26:50] said let this be a memorial Satan. So
[26:52] he's talking to the devil. If you ever
[26:55] come to me again, I will point you to
[26:58] this stub. I will tell you that right
[27:00] here I met God and it was settled from
[27:03] here on. That's what we need. Maybe not
[27:06] a stub in a field, but somewhere, some
[27:09] secret closet, some place or tonight
[27:13] there will be hundreds of vows taken,
[27:15] thousands of them taken. And next year
[27:17] we will be have to take them all over
[27:18] again. We were saying we will quit
[27:20] lying. We will quit doing this. We will
[27:22] lay aside our temper. We will do more
[27:24] for God. We will do this that or the
[27:26] other only to find this in vain. But
[27:28] what a man needs to do tonight is to
[27:31] come face to face with God. And from
[27:33] then on, he's a changed creature. I wish
[27:36] I could tell it the way I believe it.
[27:39] But when a man meets God, he is changed
[27:42] from that minute. Oh, blessed be the
[27:45] Lord. The sick man can walk in the face
[27:48] of God. When the doctors had said he's
[27:50] going to die, he can walk in the face of
[27:53] God and plead his case and he will come
[27:57] away a different person. And I like this
[28:00] word to plead to please to beg to ask to
[28:03] remind God of what he promised. So
[28:05] children of Israel came to the point
[28:08] when they could say, "Lord, you promise
[28:09] to send a deliverer. Oh God, send a
[28:11] deliverer now. Oh God, send your
[28:13] deliverer. Whoever it is, send it. Lord,
[28:15] send deliverance. Send a deliverer. And
[28:17] then he come and say, I've heard the
[28:19] cries of my people, pleasing the
[28:22] promise. And I think almost done. Wow,
[28:24] this is great. Baron said he here. Some
[28:28] time ago, I was called to a bedside
[28:31] looking out of a meeting and there was a
[28:33] young boy dying and the old father came
[28:35] to me 15 years ago, I guess, would come
[28:37] to my son. He says dying with a horrible
[28:39] thing, a disease of the heart. And I
[28:42] said, I beg your pardon. It went to his
[28:44] heart and he said I was about 40 years
[28:46] old. I said well I'm 40 years old. My
[28:48] faith tells me it's all right for me to
[28:50] go and pray for this man want to be
[28:51] prayed for and so on. And the man
[28:53] himself the doctor I understood was
[28:55] Catholic. He said I want to ask you
[28:56] something. If I was a priest this man so
[28:58] he didn't want him and it was the last
[29:00] rights and bam got to go through. He
[29:02] said I went in there and the boy was so
[29:03] low till he was just barely breathing.
[29:06] He had been unconscious about two days.
[29:08] I didn't understand medicine and the
[29:10] great scientific research that God has
[29:12] let men do for sick people. I forget
[29:15] what the beat was. I was almost gone. So
[29:17] the mother was standing there. I spoke
[29:19] to her. So I got to the other side of
[29:20] the bed and then he says, "So I went
[29:24] across to the other side of the bed,
[29:25] knelt down and just a simple prayer and
[29:29] laid hands upon the boy. I said, "Lord
[29:32] Jesus, this father and mother has
[29:34] brought me here to pray for their son
[29:36] and he's dying and only you, Lord, can
[29:39] help him. And I know that you said,
[29:42] "These signs shall follow them that
[29:43] believe." You see what brother I'm doing
[29:45] there? He is praying and he is serving
[29:48] back to God his own words. He is telling
[29:52] God, I know that you said these signs
[29:58] shall follow them that believe. So this
[29:59] is a sample prayer, right? If they lay
[30:02] hands on the sick, they shall recover.
[30:04] And here's words. I plead that promise
[30:08] to you, Lord Jesus, for the sake of this
[30:12] boy's
[30:14] life. That's I said, "Thank you, Lord."
[30:16] No change come at all. The old father
[30:18] raised up and said, "Lord, I'm so
[30:20] grateful to you. Ever grateful for
[30:22] healing my son." And they reach around.
[30:24] The mother fell into his arms. She said,
[30:26] "Dad, think of it. He's going to be well
[30:29] known. I stood and looked and they were
[30:32] happy and rejoicing and weeping and the
[30:35] boy, here we go, was just as low as he
[30:38] could be. They said, "Oh, it's
[30:40] wonderful." And the little nurse looked
[30:43] around. She looked at me, she said, "I
[30:45] believe you you misunderstand the
[30:46] doctor's orders." She said, "I believe
[30:49] you misunderstand the boy's dying." Oh,
[30:51] the old man said, "No, he isn't dying.
[30:53] He's going to live." And so she said
[30:55] look sir I appreciate anyone having
[30:58] faith like that but said how can you
[31:01] laugh and gone like that and you see
[31:03] there's no difference in the boy and
[31:05] said the boy will die I said she he
[31:09] can't live well well well we don't see
[31:11] how he has lived this long said it's
[31:14] never been known in among sick people or
[31:16] science rather that a person ever went
[31:18] that low with a heartbeat like that some
[31:21] kind of cardiogram or something that
[31:22] never come back again and I will never
[31:25] forget that old man. He put his hands
[31:28] upon her shoulder just like a father to
[31:30] a daughter. He said, "Look, my dear
[31:32] child, that cardiogram is what you are
[31:35] looking at. That is what you are trained
[31:37] to look at. That's all you know about is
[31:40] that cardiogram. But I'm looking at a
[31:43] divine promise." The boy is married, got
[31:46] three children. Now, it depends on what
[31:48] you're looking at. He never got any
[31:50] better for two or three
[31:52] days. But after a while, the first thing
[31:55] you know here, he come right out of it,
[31:58] went home, he's a missionary in South
[32:00] Africa now with three children. Now see,
[32:03] it just goes to show or you've got to be
[32:06] persistent that never butter that old
[32:08] man that settle. So friend, I am
[32:14] convinced that the God of Abraham,
[32:16] Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Malachi 4,
[32:20] the God of the Bible, will make himself
[32:23] known to nations, to people, whether in
[32:28] deliverance, whether in restoration or
[32:31] whether in
[32:32] judgment. In the church, he demonstrated
[32:36] his power and make himself known. When
[32:38] Saul was blind and he was told to go to
[32:42] get hands laid on him to receive his
[32:44] sight, God was taking a man that was
[32:47] persecuting the church to make him a
[32:50] mighty gentile, a mighty prophet of God
[32:52] for this hour, for that hour. Paul an
[32:55] apostle. Paul a prophet. Paul had to
[32:59] humble himself to to to lay to get hands
[33:02] laid on him to receive his sight, to
[33:05] receive the Holy Ghost. that man called
[33:08] and the church had to receive him as a
[33:10] messenger from God. What God is going to
[33:12] do in this last day when he say I will
[33:15] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[33:17] former and latter rain in the first. I
[33:20] want to encourage you tonight. Don't let
[33:22] go. Don't give up. Don't trust your own
[33:26] senses and feelings. Believe what God
[33:29] says. God is truly bigger than your
[33:31] problem. God have the whole world to
[33:33] deal with. Your problem is a small thing
[33:36] in his sight. Be burly. Ask for big
[33:40] things. Come on a great expectation
[33:43] Sunday. Invite somebody out. Share the
[33:46] link with somebody to encourage them to
[33:48] encourage some soul out there. I want
[33:50] you to press forward in
[33:53] faith. Great faith. Show your faith.
[33:57] This family that son was prayed for in
[33:59] that short prayer. A long long johnong
[34:03] prayer. Just a short prayer believing
[34:07] that God will do it by reminding God
[34:10] what he promised. There are so much
[34:12] promises that we have preached, so much
[34:14] promises inside on in you that you could
[34:16] anoint. God promised the Holy Ghost. God
[34:19] promised revival. God promised super
[34:21] church, super race. God promised you to
[34:23] be strong. God promised you to be a
[34:25] overcomer. God promised you dominion, to
[34:29] be a king and a priest. All these are
[34:30] promises that you could remind God of
[34:33] what he promised and you could have a a
[34:35] hold of him tonight in prayer. Let us
[34:36] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, it was
[34:38] such an excitement to come to share
[34:40] these words with your people that you
[34:43] told Moses, "See what I will do with
[34:45] Pharaoh. You shrink Pharaoh down to
[34:48] size." And you could tell your servant
[34:51] and prophet Moses, "Look what I'm going
[34:53] to do to that man. Look what I'm going
[34:56] to do to Egypt. I'm going to judge
[34:58] Egypt, but I'm going to deliver you
[35:01] because we have our flesh to contend
[35:02] with this flesh, this Egypt, this world.
[35:06] But Lord, you promise a total and
[35:08] complete deliverance. Not just a perfect
[35:10] standing by your blood, but a perfect
[35:12] state by your spirit. Father God, will
[35:14] you give the people a witness of your
[35:16] spirit tonight by baptizing them with
[35:18] your Holy Ghost right where they are
[35:20] even now tonight? Give them experience
[35:22] of the glory, vision, revelation,
[35:24] inspiration, and of your presence.
[35:25] release the uncction that may cross into
[35:27] you. There are many that battle with
[35:29] depression, frustration, discouragement,
[35:31] feeling Lord out of it. But I pray
[35:34] somehow this word pierce through just as
[35:37] you could deal with Moab, you could deal
[35:39] with the Philistines, you could deal
[35:41] with Zidon and told them about the
[35:43] judgments coming to them. Right in our
[35:46] news, we just hear bloodshed in the
[35:48] streets and and all kind happening and
[35:50] we don't even know the magnitude of what
[35:52] has happened to that country and that
[35:54] nation. why it is what it is, why it is
[35:57] how it is. But here we are Lord in the
[36:00] midst of prophecies being fulfilled.
[36:01] Here we are Lord looking for own victory
[36:04] looking like how Caleb look 40 years now
[36:08] therefore give me my mountain. Father
[36:09] God give the people great courage not to
[36:12] go into that channel of I'm unworthy and
[36:14] I don't deserve it and all that sort of
[36:16] negative stuff. But may they understand
[36:19] as Samson broke through to recognize the
[36:22] locks have been restored. He could pray
[36:24] once more. Lord, Samson, saw a
[36:27] possibility. Samson, so an opportunity.
[36:29] May our people tonight see a
[36:31] possibility, an opportunity. Whether
[36:32] they sick with disease, cancer, tumor,
[36:35] whatever condition they are in tonight,
[36:37] may they believe in their heart, I am
[36:39] the Lord that healed thee. God, give
[36:42] great courage to your people to believe
[36:44] in signs, wonders, and miracles. You are
[36:47] still a work of miracle. Work a miracle
[36:49] for them tonight. In Jesus name I ask
[36:51] it. Amen and amen. God bless you. I
[36:53] trust the Lord that this uh was
[36:56] inspiring to you and an encouragement to
[36:58] you that you would go forward in faith
[37:00] to believe that God will do more than
[37:02] you could ever ask or think. So God
[37:03] bless you as we get down to prayer.
[37:05] Praise the Lord. Thank you
[37:09] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.

[1:28:03] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank
[1:28:05] you Lord Jesus. Thank you for your
[1:28:06] presence Lord. Thank you for your spirit
[1:28:08] Lord. Thank you for your word. Thank you
[1:28:10] for the light shine on we. Thank you for
[1:28:12] the path you made before us Lord that we
[1:28:14] could place our feet on solid rock Lord
[1:28:16] the rock of revelation. Father,
[1:28:18] believing all the promises spoken by
[1:28:20] this end time prophet messenger that you
[1:28:21] have sent in this last day before the
[1:28:23] terrible day of the Lord. Father God,
[1:28:25] the time of judgment, the time of
[1:28:27] restoration, the time of redemption. Oh,
[1:28:30] I thank you for the people gathered here
[1:28:31] tonight. May your blessings and the
[1:28:33] canopy of life fall over them, Lord.
[1:28:35] Even charity, the love of God take away
[1:28:38] all evil, all unbelief, everyone not
[1:28:40] like you, Father. Blessed be the name of
[1:28:42] the Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[1:28:43] Lord. We bless it tonight, Lord. We
[1:28:45] worship you, Lord. We thank you for
[1:28:47] healing. We thank you for deliverance.
[1:28:49] We thank you for your virtue. We thank
[1:28:51] you for strength. We thank you for
[1:28:52] encouraging us. We thank you for
[1:28:54] inspiring us. We thank you for drawing
[1:28:56] us near unto you. Even as your word
[1:28:58] declare, "Draw nigh unto me, I'll draw
[1:28:59] nigh unto you." You promise these
[1:29:01] things, Lord. You promise, "My people
[1:29:03] that call by my name shall humble
[1:29:05] himself and pray that we will hear from
[1:29:07] heaven." And Lord, you would heal our
[1:29:09] land. This is your word. You cannot
[1:29:11] change that. You spoke that. We plead
[1:29:14] these promises Lord that oh God this
[1:29:16] will become effective to us Lord. We
[1:29:18] don't want to be like scribe and
[1:29:20] Pharisees and just going with
[1:29:21] traditions. We want this word to be a
[1:29:23] learn reality. We want this word to
[1:29:25] become flesh. We want this word in the
[1:29:27] young people and the mothers, the
[1:29:28] fathers, the husbands, the wives, the
[1:29:30] brothers and sisters. We want this word
[1:29:32] be expressed. We want this word be on
[1:29:34] fire in the church. Lord, if each the
[1:29:36] person, Lord, if the people would forget
[1:29:38] their dogmas, forget their own ideas,
[1:29:41] forget their feelings and just plead
[1:29:43] what you promised. Take the Bible, you
[1:29:45] said, and plead a promise. By stripe,
[1:29:47] I'm healed. I am delivered. I'm free. Oh
[1:29:50] God, you promise and make us the head,
[1:29:52] not the tail. You promise to raise us up
[1:29:54] in good health and strength that we
[1:29:56] could serve you better. Oh God, heal the
[1:29:58] sick in our midst, Lord. Touch the
[1:29:59] elders, touch the deacons, touch the
[1:30:00] trustees. Father God, touch the anchor
[1:30:02] points in the church. Go from the pulpit
[1:30:04] to the backbench. Father, may your
[1:30:06] virtue flow to the sisters, to the
[1:30:07] brothers, to the single ones, to the
[1:30:09] married ones. Oh God, flow onto them,
[1:30:11] Father, with your love and with your
[1:30:12] presence. Life is just temporary. We're
[1:30:14] in a temporary holy be. Father, as we
[1:30:16] step out, oh God, in faith, to connect
[1:30:18] with eternity, oh God, help us tonight.
[1:30:21] Bless the upcoming service, this coming
[1:30:23] Sunday, this special youth oriented
[1:30:25] service. May you inspire it. May the
[1:30:26] anointing come down upon it. And most
[1:30:28] importantly, may you confirm the word
[1:30:30] with signs, wonders, miracles, and
[1:30:32] mighty deliverances granted, God, and
[1:30:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost being
[1:30:36] poured among your people in Jesus name I
[1:30:38] ask it. Amen and amen. Glory.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah. God bless you, saints. It's
[1:30:42] so good to be here. So good to have you.
[1:30:44] And I commit you into the hands of God
[1:30:46] and pray that God will bless you and
[1:30:48] keep you and preserve you. God bless you
[1:30:50] and see you on Sunday. Lord be with you.
[1:30:52] Praise the Lord.
