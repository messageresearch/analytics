help your people to come closer to you lord to recalibrate as it were their thinking to reboot the internal operating systems of their lives father lord god may you take me out of the way and may you speak to your people may you touch your people may you open our understanding lord to the scriptures lord and may you have your way into night service in the precious theme of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege tonight to be in bible study tonight so they want to appreciate uh the effort and the commitment and the zeal and the passion and uh to be in fellowship around the word of god and to focus on the scripture and uh even if you're here tonight and it's not just based on zeal or enthusiasm but it's based on need and need of a word need of an encouragement uh maybe you're here tonight and and you have simply tied a knot in the rope of life and you're hanging on for their life you know looking for an answer to a pressing situation or pressing concern we trust that tonight you know something will be said through god's word that will has pushed us to where where we need to go you know and uh in recent times you know you you see situations you see believers you see people and you see people in different positions different stages or spots in their journey their journey of life and their challenges and their unique situations and and as you ponder and as you wander and in recent times you know you know for those who would have been in church on sunday uh a certain line i was taking and you know i find myself you know going through the wood and thinking more thinking you know i realize that many times we don't stop to think and during this whole process of you know the bible studies for us you know one of the burdens in my heart is for us to pause to think you know many times we don't think deep enough long enough hard enough to really come to the root of an issue or a matter and i've realized that many scriptures and quotes and words that we hold there we know it as in the root we know it as in we can repeat it we know it as in we can share it we know it as we can even get inspiration from it but then i ask myself the question do we really understand it because a deep understanding of something only happens when you spend quality time into something you know and all of a sudden the word that was expressed to joshua to meditate on the word day and night has begun to take on a new meaning you know of the significance of what it really means to meditate on the word day and night and and that word meditate as i've said before is not read you know you could only meditate on what you have read you could only meditate on what you have heard you could only meditate on what you have studied so there has to be a distinction between meditating and reading and meditating and studying so my hope and my desire is that after we go through these studies of the scripture that you would spend quality time thinking about what you have heard and looking at it from different angles and perspectives and most importantly to see how it applies to our lives you know and i was sharing with someone yesterday you know i i was reading something about bill gates so i asked someone today do you know who bill gates is you know and they said to me yes i know bill gates is and i said do you know that bill gates is known for when he is going on a vacation he reads three hours every day you know what i was just sharing and i said you know it's interesting because when he was interviewed and they asked him about learning and reading he expressed that it was critical to his success and for those of you who know bill gates is the one of the founders of microsoft and stuff the what could come to your mind is after you have achieved certain things why study why read why would you want to keep learning if you have achieved you know and there are many i call it super spiritual you know unbalanced christians and the message is a safe haber a safe harbor harboring ground for people who accept mediocrity with the mediocrity and the approach to scripture mediocrity and the approach to studying the word mediocrity and their in their limited understanding of things because either laziness is one and and i'm and i'm i'm i'm challenging our thinking because we are limited either by our experiences we are limited by what we may have been told we are limited by so many things and and i find as i go through scripture i recognize that there's a lot that doesn't line up with things that we may hold true and dare with the way god expresses it you know so i'm laying that as a foundation for this encouragement tonight i'm not going to be too long with you but i do intend to challenge you tonight and challenge you to move from your current position to a better position move from your current state in your spiritual walk to a better state in your spiritual work and the unction has to be yours you know um so i have a thought tonight uh change your thinking change your life as you thought tonight change your thinking changed your life i believe that if your thinking is changed your life will change how we think affects our lives the bible says as a man think in his heart so is he so your thinking is connected to your life what you think about god affects your relationship with god what you think about church affects your relationship with church what you think about you affects your relationship with you what you think about your wife your family your loved ones your interactions your business your health your ambition your desires it affects you your thinking influences your life the bible says in romans 12 and verse 12 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i'm not going to be too long with you tonight because i believe this teaching tonight is a foundation for where we need to go but that be not conformed to this world the way to not be conformed or the the opposite of being conformed because it's followed by the word but and it tells you what to do instead so the use of the word but in scripture is to give you another direction so the alternative to being conformed to the world so so so i want you to look at the center and structure and be not conformed to this world but i'm giving you another pathway to take another road to take all right but be transformed by the renewing of your mind to a specific outcome that you may prove so there's something to prove so the changing of your mind is to create a proof that what that prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so that's the king james and during his teaching tonight i'm gonna move quite often between the king james and the amplified because the amplified gives now a further wrapping or context around the scripture so romans 12 2 in the amplified listen to how it's positioned now and do not be conformed to this world listen any longer with its superficial values and customs so it's now giving a further context to the definition of what world is for us all right and do not be conformed to this world any longer with its superficial values and customs the word superficial is when something is is not real all right superficial right but be be transformed listen to the amplified and progressively changed so if i have any desire from our bible studies and our teachings and coming together is there must be some progression it is very disappointing it's very demotivating it's very troubling and it should trouble us all when people don't make progress it should be disturbing to us when we do not make progress in our lives that we haven't figured out how to be happier we haven't figured out how to pray better that we haven't progressed in our relationships with each other that we haven't progressed and and we were still struggling with these same struggles in the same kind of way we have struggled a long time and when we look back we cannot see that we have progressed we must make progress there must be a change in your life from how you were last week to this week if there is no desire to change then you are already out of line with what god's agenda and objective and purpose and focus is for us because we are being restored back to of from or or or back to the condition we were before man fell and it's not a overnight snap finger restoration it is the progress and we hear it in scripture and we see through the word add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience it is progress even god and laying out the church ages it is a progression it is adding add progress progress progress if your goal is to save money you supposedly don't measure the progress anybody with me tonight all right so i'm going to touch different things because i'm trying to get to a point here all right so i want to nail this down carefully and and take my time to make sure everybody catches it because there are many people sitting out in churches sitting down in the message the increase of knowledge doesn't necessarily mean progress in your life because there are many people who have read books and scriptures and the jealousy the rock the hard stone of jealousy in their heart there's been no progress the jealousy is still there the envy is still there the animosity is still there the hatred is still there the grudges are still there the approach to things the approach to things sometimes it's not what you say it's how you say it there must be progress with these things in our relationships by this shall all men all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another so progress is also measurable by the way your love changes one for another the more compassion you have one for another the more forgiveness you have one for another the more empathy that you have one for another all right so do not be conformed to this world any longer any longer speaks to the fact that okay we understand there would have been some level of conforming that took place before this word became clear to you it is understandable that you may have tried to fit in because it is all that we knew it is all that we understood it is all that we were exposed to so we really had no choice but now that our understanding is being open to the clarity of a different way and a different direction and a higher way and a higher direction and a better approach to life any longer with its superficial values and customs but be transformed and progressively change listen to the scripture it goes on the enemy fight as you mature spiritually by the renewing of your mind focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes so that you may prove for yourselves what the will of god is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan and purpose for you so i want that to be an encouragement to you so you see a context i'm building somewhere and um i will ask a little bit i might send all these little notes i don't normally have much notes but i see buddha been signing a little note something i have to step up boy so i have these notes here i might just permission i'll see i can send this note out here you know what to encourage you know a little bit of the step of one sent fire something else so you know so i've been written down here so we'll try to email this out yeah so and then so i want to move on now to another contest and i'm building into something philippians 4 verse 8 finally my brethren so this is paul speaking now and typically you know and and there are many approaches to writing and expressing and communicating if you study the great orators and the great writers you study english in general paper and literature you study shakespeare and the ancient philosophers they speak of an approach to expression and one thing about paul the way paul writes his books and his epistles speak of a learning man in his structure so i always say that when you look through scripture and you understand and and and the way god would take different people and but abram said when god choose a man he he knows his personality he knows what he's trying to get out of the man that's why he took him a certain time away so when paul says something like finally paul likes a long his emphasis in his finales you know he leaves this punch for he just punched it it almost comes across as if you remember anything about what does it say tonight remember this thing all right so paul in philippians 4 verse 8 says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report this is this is this is this is not just life this is paul is expressing deeply powerful things here if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things so paul in that entire verse is guiding us on where our thought patterns our thinking where it should be it's not powerful what have you been thinking this week what did you think about today what did you wake up thinking about because your thoughts influence your life anybody with me as a man thinking in his heart so he is and you're thinking influences what you speak so when you begin to speak i'm not feeling good i don't know what going on in my life i don't feel things working out it is very difficult to speak positive if your thinking is not positive so tonight you want to arrest your thinking because brother branham said you know your words is your thoughts expressed anybody with me all right so for you to begin to speak differently you see and and and and there's also this powerful thing about speaking on your mind coming in line with your speech because when you speak against your thinking your your mind has to start to figure out how to get in line with you with what you're saying so that is why if you will say it too or or speak to the mountain or or speak because when you speak even if your brain has to catch up you need to catch up all right so let's let me nail this down i want to read this in the amplified as well finally believers so in the king james said finally brethren but now let's put in a little more context it's not just brethren because i mean it happened who are brethren like that bridge who are believers so it's just bridging but this is believers so you're speaking to believers now finally believers whatever is true whatever is honorable and worthy of respect whatever is right and conformed by god's word whatever is pure and wholesome whatever is lovely and brings peace you see how it's been expressed here now brings peace whatever is admirable and of good repute if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think continually on these things center your mind on them and implant them in your heart what i'm trying to fight church is you see the negative thinking and the negative thoughts and the negative approach listen we cannot be negative people jesus didn't come for us to be negative and to be depressed and to be frustrated and to be upset with life and you're blaming the government do you know what government you belong to you know what kingdom you belong to do you know what your father owns do you know what your heritage is what your inheritance is what you were born to achieve and to accomplish even if it's not clear to you rest assured with confidence that god has a plan that's bigger bigger for you than you could even imagine anybody with me tonight what he has planned he said eyes have not seen heirs have not heard what is in store for you and that alone should be a comfort to you that the condition you are in tonight doesn't have to be that condition tomorrow doesn't have to be that condition next week doesn't have to be that condition next month if you can get your thinking to change about where you are supposed to be no more mediocrity so i'm building tonight i'm not going to be too long with you i'm laying off foundation so i read those two scriptures to kind of bring some direction i'm dealing with thinking and i just wrote this down here to change your thinking so now i'm speaking these are these are my words you know to change your thinking you need to question your assumptions you need to question your beliefs you need to question your experiences you need to question your knowledge you need to question your approach you need to question your habits you need to question your fears and most importantly you need to question your thinking now this is very very deep to change your thinking you must question your assumptions many of us make assumptions without evidence without data we make assumptions without knowing so we see somebody looking serious and we assume something wrong with them we see a situation and we make an assumption and without asking a question or understanding the context we make an assumption and we act on assumptions assumptions could be useful but assumptions can be problematic many times we assume the wrong thing and we make decisions based on assumptions what is worse is when somebody make an assumption and share the assumption with you and it influences your decision about something so now the assumption they make becomes your facts and when you question why am i doing it this way so i love when brad alvin says husband love your wives scripture and he puts in not as your father love your mother and the reason he says that because most of us we base what we know and what we have seen so we are limited by what we have seen we are limited by our experiences so most of us we judged what we do by but how i grew up this is what i went through but how i grew up this is what led to me so you have people who hoard things they hoard they hoard the hoard they hold they hold because maybe when they were younger they didn't have much so now that they get older they they don't want to ever be in a position where they don't have so they hoard the thinking when you these are real situations nowhere i want to tell them listen you can't keep bringing stuff into your house without putting stuff out you ever meet somebody who can't put stuff out of the house and the only tickets up in the house it's it's a thinking issue and it applies in so many areas of our lives we had a bad experience at me i share my own experience i have been to swimming lessons twice i didn't change my thinking because i still car swim i had a bad experience in the water no i don't know what process i have to go through too people always say but you live in an island and and you can't swim that is my reality that is my issue hopefully before the rapture could work on it but the reality is unless my mind changes you could be the best swimming instructor unless you know how to re reframe my thinking about the matter is me and a doodle or whoever it is he has hold on to because i i have faith and confidence in many things but don't throw many deep in the water i'll be like peter save me i'll be first i even trying but that is the result of your thinking they say if you think you cannot do it there's no way you could do it so i want to encourage you now so let's build to change your thinking to repeat you need to question your assumptions your beliefs your experiences your knowledge your approach do we always have the right approach do we have the right approach have you ever questioned your approach have you ever wondered if the approach you took was the right one to a specific situation because if you don't stop to think did i approach the right way could i have approached it better that's a good question to ask was there a better way to approach it was there a better way to speak to my son my daughter my wife was there a better way to deal with a situation with a bang was there a better way because what jesus came was to bring a better way he said you have heard it said this this this this but i say unto you and he giving you another way of thinking about the same material so the woman who was who was caught in adultery and they were about to stone her they were right in the approach to stay but moses law says if you're caught a stone jesus didn't tell them i bring in a different law he just changed their thinking only matter on the situation he said no problem i'm i'm fighting moses law moses law has this context i'm just asking him another question which of you without sin think about this which of you without sin cast the first stone that's all i say and all of a sudden he created what is what we call a paradigm shift a change in their thinking about their context of the situation he challenged them to look at themselves so he changed the focus by the question he asked he changed your focus from the woman to being more introspective he said which of you so look at yourself you're looking at her you're looking at her situation but what are your issues have you worked on you and many times as parents as leaders as officers as ministers as whatever many times we are placed in positions where we have the opportunity to speak to speak out speak about and address issues that don't concern us meaning it doesn't impact us we are the unaffected ones we are just in the external situation but if we take a lesson from how jesus presented a situation and how he dealt with the situation how many times do we look back at ourselves and ask ourselves could i have approached it differently that's what i mean by question our experience question our approach question our habits question our knowledge i trust in our study of scripture we realize that we may have overlooked certain things we have we might have spent as much time as we should understanding certain things and as a as our understanding increases you recognize that your knowledge and your approach to the word is different than it was before and there's a greater placing of responsibility on your spiritual future on you one of the greatest failures i've seen in many churches is this great dependence on the ministry to do that the ministry doesn't have a role and an important one at that and a responsibility but the challenge of what was created after the first church fell was a placing of responsibility and authority on the church leadership and the and the laity coming to the priest to be absolved and the the laity doing nothing whereas when jesus came and he revealed from top to bottom it was to place a responsibility on priesthood on the believer and he could declare that you you you everyone in this room is a king and a priest so the responsibility of priesthood in our homes in our situations now places a certain attitude with how we speak how we live because it's not just the pastor has to live a certain way it is all of us have to give an account for the element of priesthood that we carry ourselves paul was clear in how he expressed it because he said follow me as i follow christ which meant useless following christ as clearly and as focused as he was because if you were not knowing where christ was you couldn't tell paul paul you're off but paul exposed himself and made himself vulnerable by saying follow me as i follow christ things must never reach a point that you can't say but it's like show me in the scripture where that comes from show me in the prophet's message where i come from and my answer cannot be because i said so because the bible says clearly be ready to give an answer so we have to be able to give an answer because it is god's word anybody with me tonight so we go and change your thinking change your life is there anybody want to change their thinking so that your life changed your family relationship change your your business change your heart change your desires change and you can hear your whole approach your outlook we see a true scripture how god came god's word to every prophet through scripture was giving them a declarative statement that was changing their thinking you know gideon mighty man of allah this wasn't an outpouring of the holy spirit this was attacking his thinking about himself and gideon made it clear by his responsibility statement by saying who you're calling great i'm from the smallest tribe the smallest family and i'm despondent in my tribe thus illustrating what his thinking was and god is confronting his thinking so i'm trying to challenge us tonight how are you thinking about yourself because if you think you're a failure you might as well feel but i want to declare to you tonight you are not a failure that every time you step foiled down and you got back up you got stronger you know have more experience than you had yesterday than you had last year and they had a year before anybody with me all of the mistakes and the challenges you made have been preparing you for where you're going next so we're moving to change your thinking you need to question your assumptions your beliefs your experiences your knowledge your approach your habits your fears your thinking this is not the kind of baby tonight where we take a character and go deeply with the character i want to arrest your thinking a little bit tonight so i went on writing here what kind of questions should we ask ourselves are all questions created equal are there questions that have more impact on our lives than others are there questions that can truly inspire a change in our behavior tonight for a few minutes instead of trying to figure out what questions we should be asking ourselves why don't we discuss questions that we can agree are important when our lord jesus christ walked the earth there are many things he could have done but he did what he was led to do so when the lord jesus asks a question please understand that the questions he asks are among the most important questions we should be thinking about because when somebody asks you a question it's to make you reconsider opposition it's to make you rethink your approach as you reason if if there's no reason to question you then there's no reason if if you're not doing something that warrants a change then i shouldn't ask any question at all so tonight for a few minutes i want to think about some of the questions that jesus asked more than that i want to challenge all of us to work on how we will answer these questions and i just have a few questions and when we close tonight now the lord asks many questions in different ways if you count them individually you might find more than 300 questions through the four gospels tonight i want to focus on a few we have said it before but i think it's worth repeating again because many of us we find ourselves caught in this web so matthew 16 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own stool or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul could you answer that question because the question jesus is asking and i asked myself if he were to come to you tonight as an individual because i hear lots of people a lot of people want to achieve this and do this and there's nothing wrong with achieving them but you have to understand where achievement and success is in relation to your soul listen to the scripture in the amplified oh blessed be the name of the lord just praise the lord hallelujah just give god some glory and worship praise god there's no interruption there but god be merciful god is good blessed be the name of the lord father we bless you father we worship you we thank you for your word and for your truth lord hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord i'm back what will you give to your soul because that's a question so jesus is saying what does it profit you to gain the whole world i've seen people choose to work overtime and at first it's about paying a bill and then it's no longer about paying a bill it's about achieving certain things and then it goes beyond achieving certain things to the ambitions and the desires of your heart you have to know you you have to know yourself your situation your context notice jesus here is not telling anybody what to do he's asking the question to make you think what does it profit to gain the whole world and to lose your soul because there's an inverse relationship between what you could gain and the condition of your soul anybody with me tonight when i'm done i just want to leave you to think i'm not going to be too long at all tonight we touched on this before matthew 5 46. for if you love them which love you what reward have thee this is something that could be plastered in every single message are not even dealing with outside the message there's any message here right now because it it's troubling how people could claim to be in this message and can't have love one for another greet somebody can't shake somebody's hand because somebody have a different view of the word and a different perspective and and and jason for if you love that much love you what reward of you do not the republicans you see him so jesus is saying you have to go beyond your circle you have to stretch now stretching is uncomfortable so what is jesus doing he is changing their thinking no no he was seeing a certain behavior and was not satisfied with that behavior and he was asking them a question that's supposed to lead to a change in their behavior anybody with me i'm almost done tonight is a short lesson you know in in school you have you go to lesson you go to school anything and you have a short class and then class finish early tonight is one of those nights class will finish early tonight but are given your homework give me some homework tonight and the homework is to work on these questions most of us we are and it's natural enough you're comfortable in your circle so for some of us it's just our family you know forgetting church we haven't we haven't reached a church it's just it's just your immediate family in your house and for some of us it's be any family homes it's part of the family in the house so we we he will do it after in another session but you love your own because you're comfortable with your own when last have you reached out beyond your own can we move on look at this question jesus asked and again he is asking the question to bring a change in thinking the theme tonight change your thinking change your life mark 4 21 and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not be set on a candlestick i'll read it one more time and he said unto them question is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under bed and not to be set on a candlestick in other words he is typing out the light that we are supposed to represent that we are supposed to be shining that we're supposed to be influencing and impacting our environment just like joseph you know and i know we did our teaching on joseph if i just i just want to go back quickly to this if you would allow me for a few minutes back to genesis i think it's genesis 39. i just want to read this again because i think it's worth a second look all right and i want to draw attention if if you have your bible that's in genesis 39 and we're going to read a few verses and joseph was brought down to egypt we remember teaching in it and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the god an egyptian brought him to the hands bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down feather and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and again the context as we would have taught in the story of joseph i just want to highlight this point here joseph was somewhat of a spoiled child and he was your favorite so we'll spoil he's 17 years old he doesn't know the language he's in a trained environment he he is struggling to fit in but the lord is with him and because the lord is with him he is prospering and he was in the house of his master the egyptian this is verse 3 and this is where i want to focus here and his master this is an egyptian this is somebody who doesn't know the lord this is somebody who is not a believer this is somebody who quote unquote is not a christian and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand how does somebody who doesn't know the lord see that the lord is with you and i want to ask the question now calm somebody who doesn't know the lord because this potiphar did not know the lord so how could scripture record that his master saw that the lord was with him so are you living the kind of a life that anybody can see the lord is with you so let me bring it back to the teachings tonight sorry so is a candle brought to be put under a bushel is your life pulsating positivity is your life shining as an encouragement as an inspiration do you know you are light do you know that you are a lighthouse in this dark world you know the bible says arise shine for thy light has come and if your life not shining then what are you doing about it what is your corrective approach and if you have a light then why are you hiding in it why are you hiding it because hiding the light hiding your this is not i'm not saying put a placard and walk around and and and you know do not one man protest or one man decoration of her and i'm not talking about that but i'm talking your life being in such a way that when people see you they could see like party for anybody else boy there's something about that boy there's something about a couple more things on it but there's different voice but the fact that potty said the lord is with him that to me is mind-blowing mind-blowing let's go on a little bit again change your thinking a lot of christians like to hide that the christians you know i remember over the years ago something that stalked me as a young young young christian i remember testifying about this in in secondary school whatever is a preaching arena when you go to your workplace or you go to a school or something truly acts first anybody remember that joey acts was tell them you're a christian true it first declared because when you declare it now you have to live up to the standard but when you keep quiet and and and you dare you this that they existed like you're undercover christian this is saying i'm not a christian you know you are christian in secret you are you're a secret agent you're a secret agent christian nobody must know this gravity people are supposed to know you're christian because when you hide it you can get away with foolishness anybody with me when you don't declare testimony you get in away with all kinds of things because you you you undercover you by saying here don't be an undercover be real be genuine on your workplace be a christian in your neighborhood be a christian in your home be a christian have a testimony don't be afraid to have a testimony don't be afraid to say there are things i do not do there are places i do not go if you have a light don't put it on that bushel let the light shine anybody with me look at this question and i'm going to close up with with these two last one luke 14. and this affects so many of us because some of us we take the approach again context we have to trust the lord there are many speaking of trust in the lord but some of us want to trust the lord and do nothing some of us want to trust the lord and don't plan so i don't know what particular situation jesus was dealing with but here he asked a question and we addressed this before in dealing with planning for 2021 but i want to bring it to us again we are not thinking hard enough long enough in your right way to get the right results and jesus own questions suggest to us what we should be doing for which of you saint luke 14 28 for which of you intending to build a tower sit it not down first and count it because whether you have sufficient to finish it that's a question you want to do something you want to change your career we in a pandemic you want to start a business you want to do a side hustle you want to do something you can't just walk into it have you considered the cost have you done research have you analyzed the situation do you understand where you are now do you understand what you need to do to get where you need to go trust in god has to be trusting god having done these things but you have your part to do have you sat down and put pen to paper you have to say write a vision and make it plain make it plain means there is no misunderstanding there's no gray area make it plain so they can run who read it i will shave ashamed but over a couple of weeks ago you know i tried to write things down and i sometimes go to meeting and it's not my favorite thing to take notes it's not my favorite thing to take notes sometime i go to a meeting and i have somebody with me to help me take notes but then i started to find these scriptures where god told moses write it down but that was like there's no better way to rebuke me than with scripture when i say to myself that's it i'm done what's a write down the men who go into war right down the journey you pass document it put it on paper put it on record that was all i that's that the matter was settled you had to convince me twice if god could tell moses who leading two million people that he had to take time to write it on who is me so this is saying question which of you intending to build a tower and building a tower is could be anything you know which of you intend me to do anything don't sit down first and count the cost there are different kinds of costs it's not just monetary costs there's time cost there's the cost of studying there's the effort to do something you want to be a welder you don't want to want to learn where lyn for this before you be a welder you want to open a well in business you know anything about welding it may not be money to study business but at least there's a cost to learn it have you considered the costs whether you have sufficient time effort energy to finish it i'm challenging you because if we have to be representatives but i random said it like this be god's advertisement board which means whatever we do we have to be best in class but everybody i'm saying you want to be a bum you said it be the best bomb show people what being a good bomb look like best in class so question which of you intending to build a tower sit it not down first in other words before you start count the cost analyze the situation whether you have sufficient to finish it and he goes on and i read it it's in luke 14 29 lest happily after he lay the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him so jesus is questioning them saying listen i know only know better because this is the journey people take when they don't do the proper due diligence so this here is a balance again well i trust in a trusted workout i i got an entire thing oh you can be you can't be trying a thing if you're doing something you're doing it the right way you're serving god you're serving god a hundred percent you're working on your marriage you're working on a hundred percent yeah you're not trying to think you know we wasn't doing too good but trying to improve no improve improve improve don't try to improve improve do it make the improvements he goes on verse 30 saying this man began to build and was not able to finish and for jesus to bring clarity to it he asked another question or what king so he's dealing with no with two levels he said which of you want to build a tower that's something that anybody could do but now he's addressing leaders leadership leadership thinking or what king he puts no context he takes it above building a tower which is something that anybody could do to the managers among us or the leaders among us or the visionaries among us or those in authority among us or those who have to do more strategic planning among us or what king going to make war against another king sit it not down first and consultative whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that commit against him with twenty thousand and and this is the question jesus is asking and it's a question about approach it's a it's a question about strategy it's a question about having people to consult that's why i share with young people in church after church i said there are enough people in our church who are teachers and different professions that if you want that profession why don't you go ask them what does it take to be a good one i want to do this what what should i look out for what shouldn't i do that is consulting because you want to approach in the right way you want to know that you're going into something that is sound years ago when henry ford rolled out the first ford car in the early 1900s you know what what was the most biggest careers of those days the guys who were doing horseshoes because the horse and buggy age was in full force so after a while when the car come if kasata meek and you say well i really want to go in this horseshoe profession you go into a profession that really may not um much longer you know so you have to know based on what's happening in your environment what to go into i'm almost done verse 32 or else while the others yet far off or way off a great way off he send it and ambassador and desired conditions of peace and the last scripture and this for some people may be a shock because a lot of people never really looked at the description i know this we read parts of it luke 16 and verse 10 he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much so jesus was given context he said he that is faithful in which is least is faithful also in much and he unless injust is unjust in the least is unjust also in much verse 11. so say in luke 16 verse 11 and listen to jesus saying something here if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches now this is this is real serious when you see the context of the scripture because jesus first leads it by saying who he who is faithful in little is faithful in much he that is unjust in the least is unjust in much and jesus gave a comparison that you never really see much in other places he is saying if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon in other words if your salary you're getting in the month you can't even manage it how could you manage true riches think about it to see how much and jesus is using an example very very simple and he is dealing understanding he's speaking to managers he speaks we talk about adoption and taking over the father's business and i must be about my father's business i'm talking about signing a check all these examples in scripture and jesus is saying if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon the money you get in the world in your business in your career in your salary who will commit to your trust the true riches what are the true riches so god is watching your management of these simple things including how you do your own financial management to see if if you can manage your own little budget how are you even true riches to manage i know some of you never saw that before i want you to think about it change your thinking change your life it makes you weigh a lot of different things and listen to verse 12. this is the last one and i'm done for tonight i'm just giving you food for thought and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own no this is serious i will share this with young people and this is it here a lot of young people want to open their own business and they want to have success and they want to achieve and you know you know that's why they say he who is faithful who is he let himself all right so if you can't be a great employee you can't be a great manager if you want to be a leader you have to understand what it is to follow so the bible jesus is saying you know and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own i have seen many people approach work as in are working for the man i'm working for the man and if i had my own business how to work harder god is saying that's not how it works you know he said do all you do unto the lord so so that you could perform as the fantastic employee and god will promote you into your own business if in your heart you hold them back because you waiting for your own to do your best work god's saying it don't work so change your thinking change your life most people haven't studied these things and i trust it's a blessing to you because you want the key to success you want to understand all this is worth to meditate on and rethink your approach but wait a minute the bible says whatever you do do it unto the lord you're working you're not working for the boss i don't care what the boss does you're working for the lord and you want to show that you've been fearful in another man's world in another man's business because promotional comfortably is or from the west promotion comes from the lord so may you be inspired to do your own study in different scriptures and look at the other question that jesus asked we can get to all of them in these studies because we're moving as the lord will lead us to bring shed light on areas you may have not looked at before but i want to encourage you look at yourself to improve in quality management and quality control there's something called delta plus what's working and what need to change so every day you can ask yourself what was good what needs to improve what was good what needs to improve that's typically it very simple truck yeah that was good what need to improve and everything that approach our life that's why we make progress what do i need to improve we touched on this the rich young ruler had come to that spot he realized that he had really limit to his understanding of what he had to improve so when he did his self-assessment he come to the conclusion i lacking something what like i yet because i can't put my finger in it i keep the commandments i follow the law everything that i could do are doing everything i could add i've added but he didn't realize it was no longer about adding for him it was to take something out that was insane when jesus saw that he said go sell what you have and give it to the poor because you have something in your heart you're holding more deer than eternal life and in one of the most tragic scriptures in the entire bible as i said before a man got an answer from the lord and couldn't reconcile it with his own life he would direct from god and didn't have the will the desire to change i trust that tonight you could be inspired to first want to change and to more importantly be willing to change like i said this is not a a big teaching it's not a it's not a super spiritual teaching and i don't know how you want to look at it but they say what he lord put in my heart that if we change our thinking you change your life change your thinking you change your marriage change your thinking it's changed how you interact with your co-workers how you interact with your boss how you interact with your neighbor because you can't change them but you can change your thinking you can't change your children but you can change your thinking and how you think about them can make you look at this situation differently and treat them differently and maybe ask them the right questions that make them really look at themselves but it must start with what you can control which is your own thinking think positively think happy thoughts and as we read it at the beginning from philippians and i'll close with this before we close in prayer finally brethren so this is my conclusion tonight finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things shall we bow our heads i would have prayed oh heavenly father tonight lord these scriptures around thinking what we think how we think lord and how you stood there walking on this earth watching the human condition and the interaction of brother with brother father with son mother with daughter families tribes people pharisees sadducees priests and common folk and you saw the challenges the situations the pains the concerns you saw people lord with hatred we saw people who were in their own cliques as it were loving their own you saw people in so many situations in their hearts you ask them why you think evil you ask them how they will consider different situations you ask questions to to teach to instruct the guide to reframe their perspective help us as believers to be inspired and motivated to ask ourselves these same questions what shall the prophet amanda gain the whole world and lose to soul if we are going to do something are we considering carefully the steps we need to take before venturing are we being grenade managers stewards can we change our approach is it the best approach are we approaching things the right way can we do better how do we do better are we improving how do we improve what do i need to do what luck have yet so many questions law that we can use as a basis to grow to change to spiritually mature laws that when we look and say yes we can give an account we can give an answer we can give a response help us lord to law to as jesus spoke lord when they had that woman there to to see which of you without stim cast the first stone he switched the entire situation from what everybody was focusing on to everybody looking at themselves and when people looked at themselves they realized listen i have to make changes in my life help us dear god to make changes positive changes help us to believe and to understand that you want the best for us help us to understand lord in our mind and in our hearts that we are born to make it we are born to overcome we are born to have joy and to have peace and this great message this great gospel is brought to us for us to have life and have it more abundantly and as we move into this easter season lord where lord is a time of giving it's a greatest gift lord calvary the greatest gift for you so loved the world you give you give everything you ask the question what will a man give in exchange for his soul lord to see how you give your only son lord you gave everything so that you could be called a father you give a son so that we can have access to you lord help us to rephrase and to reframe our thinking and giving our thinking and worship our thinking on our consecration to you help
