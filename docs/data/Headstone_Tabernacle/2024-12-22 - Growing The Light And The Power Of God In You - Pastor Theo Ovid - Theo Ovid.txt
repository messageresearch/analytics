we commit his life into your hands in Jesus name I pray that each one here that you'd minister to them and meet their needs we are needy people this morning and we wait you have your way I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you and welcome this morning and if you have your Bibles I like you to turn to Matthew chapter 5:1 14-6 Luke 11 verse 33-36 and 1 John 1 5-10 reading from Matthew 5 verse 14 and 15 Jesus speaks ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a Bushell but on a Candlestick and give it light unto all that are in the house Luke 11 and it reads from verse 33 no man when he lighted a candle puted it in a secret place neither under a Bushell but under a Candlestick that they which come in may see the light the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light and when thy eye is evil thy body also is full of Darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not Darkness If thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when a bright shining of a candle do give thee light and our last scripture is from 1 John chapter 1 want to read from verse five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we see that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us let us pray father we thank you for your word and your truth and Lord one time you said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free set us free today by your the truth of your word in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you be seated praise God and as just be seated just give God some praises and give God got some worship before we sort of start today I want to time to Wednesday night service and if you haven't listened it you should listen to it very important service after the service I saw a glow the sabu's face and I really wanted to ask him what is happening with him and this morning he still have that glow on his face and he's telling me he said brother ID he said I never saw it he said Wednesday something struck him you you see that I saw something on him and he is telling me this morning he never thought like that so I'm so happy to hear his testimony praise the Lord amen so I I the Lord give me some stuff that I to share on Wednesday and I believe uh that's why I'm here this morning actually but Anthony was supposed to speak this morning but I have something here to continue we speak next week all right so I have a title grow the light and the power of God in you that's the title grow the light and the power of God in you say what is that about well we going get into it don't worry have an inspiration be a light to the world be a light to the world so on Wednesday night just to recap why should God give you more than you can manage and we know unto one he give five talents another two to another one that every man according to his several ability the man took his journey came back to ask for an account the gift is there the talent is there but is what you do with it and before God places you in a position of power and strength the position you know who is temporary until God see what you do with what was given to you in the time of probation am I place it that way that he give you am so it's not the amount one Talent two talents because the man with the one Talent say he's lazy he take the easy part and just bury it and say give me that look at look it back after 20 years they give him back the same thing God give you and God reject that and God called that man a wicked man so when you hear me talking about Wicked Woman and wicked men and wicked I am taking the eyes of God to say that I'm not I'm not just saying people making a mistake no wicked men Wicked servant Wicked man that was gifted by God and buried it gifted by God and did nothing about it gifted by God and didn't add to it because God is in the addition business multiplication business Satan is in the division business and the subtraction business we give the Lord some Praises let me say it again God is in the addition business multiplication and blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee Satan is the in a dividing business and he subtracting business he want to steal to rub and to destroy he want to take away from you God want to add to you that's why people said add to your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness God want you to add oh give the Lord a shout in the house the devil want you to contract but God want you to add all right the gift is there the talent is there is what you do with it to give a talent gives you a temporary position that is connected to a time element want to quickly call this time a time of probation there's a brother who left this church because he didn't agree with me that the fivefold there's a fold ministri is yet he says here now and I said no and he W out you know what we do here when you come we say welcome and you leave you we say bye-bye no hard feelings we still treat your right still love you the same the point about it is this that God cannot trust men with power if they do have character it doesn't even make sense if you cannot handle $100 why should go give you ,000 if you cannot manage $1,000 why should God give you $ 10,000 that's embarrassing you're blowing through whatever you have because you cannot manage so this Talent issue here five Talent two Talent is about management it's about taking and coming to the accountability with what God give you amen hallelujah so five produce five well praise God two produce two and he said well done not well talked well done they did something about what was given to them Hallelujah we have to do something if you don't do you have no well done oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah if you don't do there is no word about well done enter into the joy because you have been faithful and little you'll be faithful in much so I will give you more responsibility to take your further Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you want a promotion be committed to the little that God give you to see how you going to manage it oh give the Lord some Praises probation is to see what you will do not to see the excuses you will make it's not my fault some people always have excuses always looking to blame somebody that's not my job this there a problem for somebody else to fix your testimony God give it to you God reveal it to you God bless you God was with you 20 years ago God heal you that is not the issue you know you have a gift you know some God but the gift is not the issue you you know without a doubt God has forgiven you but what have you done with the forgiveness and I read the scripture where the man was was forgiven for 10,000 talents the king forgive for 10,000 talents and when he get free by the king from prison he lock a man neck for 100 p hold the man throat and let the man go into prison for 100 P that come like somebody you get forgiven for $10,000 and locking somebody neck for $10 make them go to PR when he can hear that and and Jesus talk about what will happen to people would not how handle forgiveness so God bless you sometime people po they struggling God bless them afterwards they head in the air rainfall they drunk CU their nose quite up in the air instead of getting more humble they get more proud is getting more humble because that's what God looking for looking for somebody the more humble the more He blesses the more humble he becomes not the more proud he becomes because human being get in trouble because of their achievement we read that man achieve and then he get proud man achieve so much they want to make a tower to God they want to pray they want to talk to God you know he said I go build a tower everybody talking the same language God say that trouble yes they coming for me they're coming up for heaven and God confused them and that will Babylon come Hallelujah God confused them by giving them different tongues isn't that right because man want to go up to heaven and sing live like a devil on Earth and go in heaven and sing with angels want to work both ways Bible talk about let nothing be done through Strife of in glory so manage how you see yourself when you overvalue yourself you're head into trouble so what Christianity does is to help us change our way of thinking we born a certain way grow up in a certain environment we accustomed with certain things and so on like that but when we come to the word the word addresses us addresses our issues that we could know how to behave ourselves and as long as we willing to subject ourselves to the of to the word things will work out for us that that is what God does he he brings his word to his people isn't that right so the Bible said do nothing from factional motives through contention Strife selfishness or unworthy ends or prompted by conceit or empty arrogance instead in the true Spirit of humility loneliness of Mind Let each regard the others better than and Superior to himself what if everybody do that you respect this sister not because she tall or whatever it is you respect this brother and you see them better than yourselves when you see that you could learn from them you could be blessed by them you cannot say well I more spiritual I older I long don't have nothing to do with it you know a lot of people like to rock back on history and that's why I blast history history is Boo history is nothing history is nothing relevant to what happening right now because that was the issue with the Scribe and Pharisees Jesus was a present child of the hour and when he start to preach to them you know what they say our fathers eat man in the wilderness they were talking about the lineage they was talking about the history they was talking about the people of God and Jesus said everyone dead so don't talk your history talk when all of them dead I am the living bread that come from Heaven that if a man eat of me he shall not die okay the Lord I shout in other words your history you could talk all your history all you want is it don't be in contact with the living bread you are dead as just them oh give the Lord some Praises because you are faithful well done not you preach well you are faithful in the temporary position I put you in what with what you have I will see what you will produce according to your several abilities because you can manage well and be faithful to the little I give you I will promote you over bigger things or many things and that confirms the scripture prom promotion doesn't come from man promotion comes from the the Lord and when God promote you nobody could demote you they could jealous you they could Envy you but they can't take your place because God put you there oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so he said what we need is a man that is tight to the word and to Christ to bring their congregation under that condition to where each member walks in the condition of the word this is what my responsibility is I can't change you you have to want to change and God and the word and the Holy Ghost could change you but you don't expect me to sit here and let you walk in and walk out just the way you want to walk in and walk out this is not your mother's house this is not your father's house this is not your family house this is the house of God that's why Jus beat a strap and beat them out and say my father's house shall be called a House of Prayer he let them know this is not their house you could go and sweep your house and do whatever you want in your house hang up Christmas tree and Christmas this and and change curtain and whatnot that is your house but this house have to get the word so each person is to be brought in the condition of the word of God in other words you're not coming here for religious activity then that's what Catholics do and other people do they go to church as a religious activity all different religion as an activity you're not coming to church as an activity you're coming to church to have a life-changing experience so God want to fill you why does he want to fill you what does he want to fill you with he wants to fill you with himself the holy spirit filled with Holy Ghost I still haven't got to where so there just the backrop right okay so I want to look at Saul a little bit you ain't get any message yet we have no Wednesday night service so make a combine not everybody say Amen on that people want to go and do this stuff all right okay 1 Samuel 10:1 then Samuel took a vow of oil and pour it upon his head this H his soul and kissed him and said it is not because the Lord had anointed thee is it not the the Lord had Anointed The to be Captain over the serans so Saul was anointed first Samuel 10: 5 Samuel speaking to Saul after Thou shalt come to the hill of God where is the Garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass when thou come t to the city thou shallal meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with Sultry and Tabet and pipe and half before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shall be turned into another man and let it be when these signs are Comm unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for God is with thee what a powerful testimony this sa guy Anointed with oil kissed by the prophet prophesy with the rest of prophets spirit of God come upon him and Samuel told him you will know God is with thee amen first 10 1st Samuel 11 verse 14 and 15 then Samuel said to the people come let us go to gigal and renew the kingdom there and all the people went to gigal and there they made Saul King before the Lord in gigal and there they sacrifice sacrifices of Peace offerings before the Lord and there Saul and all the men of Israel Rejoice greatly then we switch to 1st Samuel chapter 13 reading from verse 5 and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel 30,000 chariots 6,000 Horsemen people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude and they came up and pitching mismatch Eastward from bethen when the children of Israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people hid themselves in caves this is God's people and tickets in rocks high places and and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of GAD and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling and he tarried seven days here we go according to the set time that Samuel had appointed so Samuel told him wait seven days but Samuel came not to gigal and the people were scattered from him and Saul look at verse 9 said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offering and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass here we go that as soon as he had made an end of the offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said he's a prophet talking him what hast thou done and Saul said listen the excuse and Saul said because I saw the people were scattered from me and that thou came as not within the days appointed and that the Philistine gathered themselves together at mishmash therefore said I the Philistines will come down upon me to gigal I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering now s was to offer the burnt offering not Saul Saul said the people Saul said this that that that that that that and I forc myself and Samuel said to Saul verse 13 that was done foolishly so sometime anointed people could act sometime call people could act sometime place people could act foolishly there are people who don't even want to admit they acting foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have establish thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now verse 14 thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord had sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord had commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded Thee I just read for you in chapter 10 this man kissed this man anointed this man prophesied and just right after that in 13 that's two chapters that man is rejected but a punch help him to preach this morning he do his own thing that's what he do that people do doing their own thing not what God said that's why you should be concerned of what God said you have to love what God love and hate what God hate you want what God Said not what your feel not what you think not what you dream what whatever what somebody say is what God have said oh it's song nice I have not made supplication in the Lord so he a want to go up and fight everybody trembling behind him so he said I I I pray yet I a make no offering to God to protect us and look but you have to wait on instructions you can't use your emotions amen hallelujah so God told him it shall I continue 1 Samuel 15 reading from verse 9 Saul and the people speared AAG and God tell them kill everything don't take no sheep no goat no nothing no chicken no pork no Pig nothing my pig and pork in them with things in other words don't touch nothing they have kill this out but they spare the king king a and the best of the Sheep and of the ox and of the fatl you see where your I seeing best you see God said kill everything but your I seeing I never had a sheep so fat look at a well-placed oxen boy woo that have a feast for Christmas Saul and the people spare AAG the best of the sheep and The Oxen and the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good that would not UT but would not utterly destroy them and everything that was vile and refused that they d destroy utterly so what was hateful and what not they lick that up then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying it repented me that I have set up Sal to be king for he is turned back from following me this man on the throne this man over charge of God's people and God repenting that he put him there I want to show you something you know is what you are given and what you do with it the history becomes irrelevant when God word is present tense for you to act on and for you to do Jesus told those Pharisees he said you say you in the light now that I come you're now in darkness because I am the light oh give the Lord some Praises before Christ come they have scriptures they have Scrolls they have books they have tapes they have the word but when the word become to me made manifest that is light as the word become manifest Hallelujah so he said watch it repented me I have set up Saul to be king for he turned back from following me had not performed my Commandments and it grieved Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night and when Samuel rose up early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to carel and behold he set up a place and he going about passed on going down to gigle Samuel came to Saul and sa and said blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandments of the Lord I saw m talking there and Samuel said what mean this the bleeding of sheep in my ears he talking the Commandment but he if he had a chance he could have looked it up and make sure he's soundproof you know while he talking he who sheep is that what meanless bleeding of sheep in my ear and the loing of oxen which I hear and Saul said they have been brought them from the amalekites for the people SP the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice them unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed why we cut them true but this is the best then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord had said to me this night and he said unto him seon listen to the phrasing of this listen to The Eyes Of God as God as God sees different from how man sees s said when thou was little in thy own sight that means he is no longer seeing himself little in his own sight he is being in himself and he has overvalued himself in his own eyes so Samuel have to tell Saul when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribe of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel in other words you start off humble you start off simple you start off dependent upon God look at your now look at your pride now look how you're doing you you doing your own measurement God say kill all you're killing some and keeping rest to offer unto the Lord when thou was little in thine own sight I wonder how much people are little in their own sight or they want to as we say RAM on somebody else or show off for somebody else your sister I know she not from here because she had more money she was a a a a real manipulator a real controller making this action doing this if you ask her to if she want to buy something she had to choose the color for the church she she had to pick it because her money jumping up she was on the field running for years but somebody told me right now she in a pavilion she can't score no goals no more she have to sit down now and watch who is on the field all the people God make them run their run because time reveals just a matter of time you know time reveals jealousy Envy time reveals hatred time reveals God's blessing upon your life time is a asset to the righteous oh give the Lord some Praises oh give the Lord a shout when David talk about the wicked prospering God said have you considered the end give them some more time let time run on them but blessed is the man who walk not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted Oh Glory of God planted standing in the way of Sinners and when your life so rotten nobody want to come to church because how you living you're stumbling block to God and to others you are standing in the way of Sinners repenting we are not here to make it comfortable andake

things right that you will get it right give the Lord some praises and the Lord send the on the journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then this thou not obey the voice of the Lord but this fly upon the spoil and the evilness s of God you how God seeing that he's seeing fresh oxen fresh sheep fresh cow fresh everything to bake and cook for this Christmas time and God seen evil because God said destroy it Saul said to Samuel yeah I've obeyed the voice of the Lord I have gone the way which the Lord sent me I have brought AAG the king of AMC I utterly destroyed the Amit but the people yeah excuses again and you see as I said maturity is when you could accept responsibility for your actions and attitudes

sacrifice of the Lord thy God in Israel not not not my responsibility not that's not me it's them and Samuel said had the Lord as great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice you do nothing here for 20 years you can't come and make up for that now you have a track record of 20 years of History what have thou done nothing I thought was brother and sister to your church life for somebody else to do go kind say Well done because you have done nothing it I guess it have a nothing award all who do really really nothing less than nothing nothing nothing nothing behold to obey his better than sacrifice than to Heen unto the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and this how God see now God's eyes see Rebellion as witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and Idol Tre because when you're stubborn you love with yourself I am moving you're fixing your attitude no adjustment you're going down so born so and you go dead so somebody say I born late that's why coming late to service for Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft I don't know why I have to do this this

Elders of Judah and Jerusalem and the King went up in the house of the Lord and all the king of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant which was found in the house of God this is this king and the King stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord to keep his Commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul and to perform the words of this Covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the Covenant and the King commanded hilah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made of for Beal and for the Grove and all the host of Heaven he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of kitron and carry the ashes into Bethel verse 5 he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in high places the cages of Judah in the places round about Jerusalem them that burn incense onto Baal to the Sun to the Moon to the planets to Theos of heav he brought out the Grove from the house of the Lord without Jerusalem unto the brook of Kidron and burn it at the book of Kidron stamp it small to powder and

light a light a light a light Darkness over their debt oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord some Praises amen these wise men did not come with empty hands swinging they bought gifts they did not come to see what they can get for they believe or believe what they were entitled to they brought gifts as a part of the worship of God hallelujah bringing gifts is part of worship Hallelujah m Matthew 5:23 24 Jesus speaks therefore if you bring thy gift to The Altar and remember rest that thy brother had a ought against thee leave thy gift before the altar go thy way and be reconciled to the brother and then come and offer thy gift all of this is part of worship so other words don't think God is your family and friend God have an order you can't say you love God and hate your brother you're walking in darkness If any man say he's walking in light in him in God there's no Darkness at all so his righteousness his judgment is righteous when God judge somebody do sorry is righteous judgment he judged them because they're Wicked he judged them because they're evil he judged them because they had to be taken out and God judged them I see a man say preachers must upop ly at funerals and you have a point you have a point not every prer people going to Heaven There do like every a saint in that box man living Wicked may his soul rest in peace how he soul rest in peace he torment and terrorize people on Earth and you expecting rest in peace you a rest in peace at all leave thy gift at the altar first be reconciled to thy brother then come and offer thy gift it is not the amount it is the sacrifice it's not how big the gift is or how small the gift is no it's the sacrifice and Jesus give that at Mark 12:41 he says here Jesus sat over against the treasury and behold how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich cast in much and they came a certain poor Widow to in two mites which make a fa and he called onto the disciples and said unto them that un to you so he's teaching them that this poor Widow had cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast is in their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living so God don't see the amount God see the sacrifice I'm continue Malachi 3:8 says will a man rub God yet this is God speaks you have rubbed me but you say wherein have we rubbed thee entice an offering your curse with a curse for Rob me even the whole nation bring me all the ti into the storehouse we don't teach on this what we are speaking it but that there may be meet in my house and prove me where it here it sayth the Lord of hosts if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will rebuke for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast of fruit Before Time in the field say the Lord of host and but and and in Amplified they said will a man rob or defraud God you have rub and defraud me but you say in what way do we rob or defraud you you have withheld your tithes and offering there are people who do that to punish the past children trying to put man under manners children maners and go just pass them and the curse fall on them bring all the Tis the whole tent of your income into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and prove Me Now by it sayth the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of Heaven for you and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room in it to receive it but I'm seeking first the kingdom of God have you ever witnessed that to be the truth put God first pay your tithes first because you see when God blesses you or give you wealth or power the first thing that God want you to understand is that that is further to promote the kingdom of God and then your family you call a man who can't provide for family he's wretched do you understand that the first thing God want you to understand he's blessing you for the Kingdom's sake so that is why he sees people doing that as robbers you know robber is a thief this then is the message you have heard that God is light in him there's no Darkness at all if we say we are fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth so this message is a message of light when you walk in the light not Luther or westro Pentecostal this end time message light when you walk in this light they they have no fornicators in this light you can't be walking light and fornicating you can't be walking in light and fooling around no no you can't be walking like doing that isn't that right backbiting and filthy and so on praise God this is where I want to get to now God Is A different light and yet he is light now I think of the picture of the great proof that God is light God's life here we go operated through the cosmic light of our bodies ourselves so our bodies itself have something called Cosmic light that's why you have x-ray because you seen something through you but that's not God's light that is Cosmic light it's not the same thing but Bram he said we were absolutely on one time genuine sons of God and that is where the fruit of the spirit today's love joy Faith longsuffering weekness it's got to a spot to where our whole body then he said this you know like a seaweed you got in the bottom of the sea a lot of time divers they get under the seaweed before they know it they're wrapped in such a way they can't get out of it that's the way sin has done the human being that's that's the way cess has done the church that's the way communist done the nation it is so treacherous and then in the human body is wrapped us and is pushing out this light of God by denomination and N of faith and I Illustrated it like a button here we go this part I want to get to there the key part of this service when a man is saved that much of him is God that the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong now here we go if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button like of light and power of God will keep growing and growing so you see where I get the title from Light and Power growing in you in you because we were born in sin shaping iniquity so our lives fed With Envy jealousy malice rotness and filth and God pick us up put a button inside of you Hallelujah that button surrounded by Envy jealousy malice all kind of stuff and he's saying if you kick them things out you'll give room for this button to expand the more you get rid of stuff or give the Lord some Praises you have to get rid of watch if you can take all the malice Envy Strife unbelief out that little buttonik of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief now you don't do it by bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you that is why the biggest issue now with sexual sins sins that will make you and all the homosexuality and lesbianism and all these different things is to make people abominable to God because God hates that and that will bring judgment upon the person do you understand that so that's why the devil he will do all in his power to catch people and snear people in these things that God reject them because you see God love he loves and that's why you have longsuffering that's why he is patient that's why thing going on and on like I told you a while ago Ukraine and Russia is not David and golad it's almost like waiting for a time period where things will change and that's how we have to understand it too all the prophecies was leading up to the Messiah being born the Messiah is on the earth Shepherds going to meet the Messiah isn't that right wise men coming to see Messiah and other was Jesus in infancy power in infancy power in baby form and the world don't know anything about it Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus in his position under Joseph a carpenter's son and He is building this and building that waiting for the appointed time Oh Glory from 12 to 30 he is waiting he is doing he is acting he is reading the word of God he is studying his ministry but he can't step forward yet because John has steep forward yet oh give the Lord a shout in the House John have to step forward first to make a way for messiah and anytime Messiah coming there's got to be a service there's got to be a message there got to be a cleansing there Got To Be A Way made oh the Lord I shout because Messiah is on his way glory to God hallelujah [Music] and John knowing his position he said there is one standing among you he a see nobody yet there's one standing among you in other words he knew he come to identify Messiah so he may as well speak it somebody among you he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire and Jesus just listening waiting for the appointed time and John start to baptize people and as they start to come and get baptized he said bring forth fruit start to beat them and a bunch of snake and Vipers who tell you get baptized what can i s man coming down he said B forth fruit just come and join your church I'm watching you know a is Lay to the root we should bring back a John Ministry back in I preacher with a big ax ax is to the root when they come the step they see a man with a waiting for you how was your life this weekend you answer back your husband AES L to the root repent woman get yourself in order Oh Glory to God everybody quiet inside here Bo all them men tell my wife about wom who don't want to subject yourself don't want to humble yourelf and what not and looking for a husband looking to terrorize a man some saintly Godly Man I just tortured the man see what is preaching this morning Christmas message I need man he you but he's Abraham know close to Abraham you know we want s you a that s in the Bible you know anytime you become Abraham you go see a brother saying amen now they thought I wasn't coming to the house you but come to the house too brother brandham seeing it again for instance when a man gets saved the light that comes into him is about like a little white button in my shirt when God comes into the inner part of a man in the inner part of a man a man is made up in the system of a tabernacle outer cour Place holy Hool of holies now on the inside he when you have one gate one entrance to go sh the glory where God can enter into him and take over any control tower that's true self-will think about that in other words you could will God out because you want to run your own life but your own self will say well not my will but do you see it now Jesus the Messiah he said that not my will but die will be done even if it's hurting to you even if it comes into a man's a man heart when a man is born of the spirit of God he can let that Spirit grow oh so there's a question on people who seems to be stagnant why he not growing he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can come back into the same condition that he was in the Garden of Eden so it means that when this light begin to grow you are heading back to Eden you are getting more and more like God less and less normal and human because you are not normal Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen brother brandham God could let me see God could dwell supremely to do our thinking to do what we're walking to do what we're talking it's no longer the man it's God and the man he said now he's got light life eternal life is the light of God dwells in you and if he would yield to the spirit more he becomes unman sin alike that's a beautiful word unman sin alike and it becomes more Godlike so what I'm saying then as we grow in God we supposed to be getting closer to God we supposed to have more light emanating through us when I got home Wednesday night I say but a glow on his face and I wanted to ask him about it I never saw that before and this morning he met me but you I never saw that before something struck him and it affected him or infected him that's a revelation that is some kind of inspiration and it has to strike you too if it doesn't strike you you in the same shape you in the same condition something had to strike you you wasn't born a perfect housewife you wasn't born a perfect mother you wasn't born a perfect husband you wasn't born a perfect father but you could learn you could grow you could acquire skills people don't learn to cook well automatically people just throw things in the food afterwards when it's not go to thr piece of pepper and pepper cover all these things at the wrong part but is not cooking that just that's just covering something I when I buy food outside say I just block in a hole there's a good food good food when my wife cook that is food when my wife cook that is good food other than that outside they just throwing things in a pot and they're selling you that's fast food then but when my I don't want nobody wife in I have the best cook in the country if you only taste that food I'm telling you Hallelujah she could cook and the reason she could cook because her mother could have cook and the reason mother could have cook because the grandmother could have cook I went me mother and see chicken pting and season pting behind the chicken she cutting chicken some chicken inside and put SE and see nothing like that cutting the chicken throwing inside the pot and then seasoning going behind that and when that is finished you have a perfect meal in know you don't know who went in first and who went in last food just tastes good but there are some women they're not in the cooking thing not even looking at YouTube and YouTube have experts in cooking I could say this because I'm very confident there the put and it wasn't so before some watching me strange Bo watching me like it no you should see me I enjoy doing this seasoning I enjoy cutting the chicken I enjoy doing these things I enjoy when I can serve my wife I I expect much amen for that Hallelujah but you you could cook yes I couldn't say that 20 years ago I could boil egg 20 years ago but now I could cook and boil egg too all right and I enjoy it Hallelujah brother Bram there's a one we know we're in home stretch don't worry but the brandham says this here now he says she has made herself ready so many says there we go if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I will serve him but that's up to you you have got something to do they that overcome shall inherit all things they overcome you have power to do it say I have power to do it I say it again I have power to do it you do because Jesus overcome the devil with is is written no spirit Power you take a deep breath and like lifing muscles in the gym he didn't do that he just say it is written it is written it is also written you see if you don't come to the place for it is written the devil would bring options in this life to come that may make you question if you should do what the devil's saying through laws and whatever they have now it be something else you know the latest AI Incarnation is that this AI could see and could hear so if you have the AI now and say what do you see here you say I see a tablet what do you see here I see a Pulpit now there's not a human being or some spirit inside talking yet sat jump inside yet he on his way but what they're doing is making this assistant become personal what they're doing is convincing human beings to believe in this as if this become God so you just had to talk to it now I like something now you could talk to on WhatsApp I said they going too far what to do so and so what to do so and so people after people they will have confidence in in man confidence in technology then technology becomes a God and this is how Satan get to see the eyes of the entire world God knows all things Satan does not so he needs technology to be in Prime element Hallelujah because all that dwell on the Earth shall worship the Beast except whose name written in the Lamb's Book of Life all Rich Man Poor Man professors doctors lawyers everyone will worship the Beast Hallelujah so you have got to stand on something youve got to have something that becomes your anchor you have to have something that becomes from your soul glory to God those to Hebrew boys when they heat up the technology to H seven times I don't know how do that I don't know what kind of thermometer they had to measure the heat seven times hter they say we will not bow down you going put 27 not bowing down their trust was in God their faith was in God and God pulled them through God will pull you through if you trust in him a man was made to be God he was in the image of God what happened he disbelieved God word it sent him right back to the shift for himself and God is trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow up out taking all the roots of doubts and bitterness so the more you yield to God the more you obey God the more you not compromise with your children tell them the truth you have to tell them that me skirt you're wearing that show dress you're wearing come on man it's a Muslim there on the hot day only see the eyes alone and they black from head to toe they wearing black socks and all you want to know they're being toasted inside of there but they're not studying that they committed to their cause they are committed to what they believe you have to be committed to Christ you're not trying to impress anybody else you know you're trying to impress God you want God to see the faith inside of you when you say Amen to this word this morning God is seeing the faith inside of you oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah you let that light begin to grow taking all the roots of doubts and bitterness and healing yourself to the spirit then you begin to become a Son of God a daughter of God you begin to grow in grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you arise and shine Isaiah 60 for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you for the whole gr Darkness shall cover the earth grow Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee that's the prophecy his glory will be seen upon thee Hallelujah that light will come from inside out every devil in hell will see that light Oh Glory is a supernatural light it's the light of God upon your life what a victory this morning to be a Son of God what a victory this morning for that light to keep you all these years Hallelujah you are covered you are covered you are covered by the blood oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah but Bram in the old time before they used to make goal they had they used to beat the goal out beat the sludge out iron and couple and keep beating and turning over beating it Indians do that beating goal you know how they did it they could tell the IR was out of it the dress out of it when one can beaten could see one who's beaten could see his own reflection so God see you as gold wrapped up in dirt wrapped up in mud and copper and the only way to get that out is to beat not you you getting licks is he copper is he mud is he dirt beating it out and when he see his own reflection faith and virtue and and Temperance and patience and God see his only reflection Hallelujah he know you're ready you're ready for position you're ready for power Oh Glory to God he said that's the way God does he takes the gold that he found in the earth and he beats it by the Holy Spirit turn it over and over and over until he can seees reflection and that's what we are supposed to do reflect the Son of God so many of us here we go is trying to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us and that is where the trouble is you know we see these tumbles along the way here we go and this means so much more now to me we find this crap heap of ministers oh you know have buying bottles and um old bottle B say oh scrap iron scrap iron I see a truck driving to my old but and I see that that should be a n scrap if you see the condition of that truck and he buying old metal we see a scrap heap of ministers scrap iron scrap scrap what God doing with scrap scrap people Ministers of Christians pile along the road is because they didn't go into the right and you meet that scrap now and say I know I predestinated what to be a scrap you're predestinated scrap then because you're side you're not in church he side the road devil coming for you know old scrap buying old battery buying said old battery battery old battery buy the battery not working that why they buying it they going to recycle them things so if you don't want to get it together to get life in you and you get kicked to the side of the road as a scrap Heap Some Devil come with a truck to pick you up I not coming for that cuz you shut down in church you shut down you people something when they heart they have some two things them things the paddles pow and they hit you so and hit you so if you have anything inside you jump back up if you have nothing pow po PW p p that's it you know Flat Line you're out so sometime people go dead dying and you ping them no no no you to J them that people who die and went and see hell and come back in people die and and see heaven and come back in scrap paper ministers God is a jealous God he is jealous and he wants his wife pure he wants her a virgin and chased nothing in the world into her altogether his word is part of him we must be part of the word not part of a Creed but part of the word I'm going to quickly just will come brother brand oh by if the people could only wake up a few moments and realize what the great thing is it is pride that does that the people who wants to go like the rest of the world you can't do that you're not of the world he said do you think a woman laying in a casket will want to know whether she had a a water Hue whatever you call it do you think she would pay attention to how she was dressing if she was laying on a casket they wouldn't do it that's the reason today there's so much stuff we have to copy after the neighbors Hollywood style fashion do you understand that all these Hollywood all these dress like I see all these people with all these um bitter pants um I don't know what call it them them splitter plants jeans and like that everybody biting man woman old people and wearing that I don't understand it but that is what they working with somebody said that Trend you know and people like do sheep they following somebody put a Zug in the head and everybody tattoo on the head and everybody tattoo that's when you have no I say self-esteem you know when you in shipping mode then no guidance you are son and daughter of God why you want to follow that really people blessed doing tricks and all kind of underhand thing God you don't have to work to do that I work in school already a man said Bo you want to be a drug lord said what you drug lord for he said plent money know I say that young know live fast Die Young go to hell after that quickly he said Gross Darkness upon the people gross dark the people now the world shuts all the light that we are supposed to be reflecting swings over it thrs Darkness but says here God makes complete Christians God Don't Make halfway Christians God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway oh we could have half preachers yes that was the prophet said look at Saul call felt humble privileged to be the king and afterwards bring me the sacrifice bring me can you imagine what he saying that you know he's he's King bring it to me and as soon as you finish offer it here come Samuel what going on here he said well um yes people you know I mean I I offer it up and thing he say you done foolishly why didn't wait I'm the prophet I tell you wait I am the star I am the light I bringing God TS to you I tell you wait seven days I tell you wait till I come and you went ahead and do that you was a priest you're not a priest you a king king don't do pries thing oh give the Lord some Praises I how much King you feel you are you don't do PR thing stay in your calling stay in your position stay in your position oh give the Lord a shout don't get out of order get in order line up with the spirit of the word and stay in order and God will bless you Hallelujah but preachers can be AF free God make his children Christians but sometimes they are half Christians it's not God's intention for them to be that way what is the problem here let the answer here it's their own ways got mixed up with the plan of God for their life the reason some people don't ask the ministry anything because they don't want them know what the ministry thinks about it and that the same way they don't want to ask God when you don't ask God about stuff you do your own thing and hope God bless it and God said no I'm not blessing that you have to ask me first you have to talk to me first see what my mind is on the matter and if we start to do that then we make ourselves dependent on God then God loves that because we are depending on him we we not committing our own selves to do our own thing we say Lord what is your mind on this matter because I want your mind on this matter how do I deal with it over the years I've deal with it this way and I have failed you know what it says the thing for madness doing the same thing at the same spot over and over again and expecting a different result you dig the hole You Dig the hole You Dig the hole you going to a next whole right what you expect nothing at least dig somewh else do something different you recognize your way have been failure your way have been crashing and what why you have been making circles why you have not hitting the target why something is wrong look at David David do I walk through the valley of the sh of that I shall fear no evil for dou with me run staff they comfort me don't prepar me look how he talking don't prepar me a table in the presence of my enemy my cup run it over hit out of people Abraham was very comfortable when he tell lot choose he was no God I Vex boy I Repent I bring my cousin along he was in that mode you know and know he choose the best friend Vex look what he choose and he and he tell wife Sarah you know he do go and choose the best place and desert for me no that that how the mother needers talk you're complaining you're complain you're complaining you get supporters Yeah Boy And you see lot and lot and lot the whole sermon is lot go they talk to lot God talk to you go they talk to your family God talk to you and as soon as they separate God tell Abraham look East West sou all is yours lot had to pay for the consequences of his decision to go that way Abraham stood his ground even though he was have a desert at first so sometime God may give you an experience that is a pure desert and a sister or brother who I wouldn't say well lot like then they seem more blessed and over blessed than you but time just time all right when one member will talk against another member you know that's wrong you commanded to pray for one another that displeases God all right we on the stretch keep seeing that long time about you feeling sorry for you all right I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit here this bum that still has nothing to do with it that is just a temporal gift for you this is what some ministers take and they stick into the people and mess them up and wipe them out and say there's no need for the Bing Holy Ghost because of this statment there that's just a temporal gift for you the real gift is in your soul down in here that was born of God that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there is where you grow your child of God and so forth he says now watch let's continue now he says watch then you see your real father in God if you if you you know Pentecostal because that's the real stat is in your soul before there was even a spirit is was in your soul that Soul if that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a GM of God to begin with you are deceived so what is he saying here the seed which is in the word is what God put in you but the holy ghost coming to do something to that seed just wait a minute here what he said now now there is a false anointed once in the last days not false jesuses many will come to me that day and say Lord have not I prophesied and cast out the your name I was Pentecostal glory to God I shouted and spoken tongues depart from me that work iniquity now this is the part I want to get to and we're going to close like my little story about the eagle finding his mother right he said it was it wasn't a chicken it was an eagle to begin with his his mother knew she had laid two eggs there had to be another one she flying around the banard and so on that's the way every born again Christian when you come I don't care how manych you join how many names you put name on the book he say you are Eagle isn't that right and watch all this clocking of the hand you join this join that it's nonsense it is genuine adding word to word you don't take a human germ of your father and a germ from a dog and from a cat and a chicken it's a human germ and that's the body of Jesus Christ all this is from the me called The Rapture the body of Christ will be a part of his body watch this now the bride will have to be word added to word added to word Luther's justification Wesley sanctification Pentecostal Bap Holy Ghost the preachers leave out this because they want word added to word after word no experience no Holy Ghost let the prophet continue watch restoration of the gift and the rights on top of it it's got to be word on top of word germ of top of germ life on top of life to bring out the full statue of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ word on top of word means fa virtue and Faith knowledge and virtue right on up that's word on top of word right you understand that you get that now watch right on straight on the top in that slot after birly can is what Holy Spirit to come upon word on top of word on top of word so God put all these virtues inside of you and then come the spirit now come to live in those virtues to live inside of you now here what he say here many says join our congregation right you must Shout must get a sensation he said how a woman a man a child of God has born of the spirit of God deny the word of God how could Christ deny his own word and if Christ is in you it can't deny his own word then he says the same same next chapter verse 9 of the Rapture then how do we get into this body but after all the word and word here how do we get into this body First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are baptized into this body by one Holy Spirit baptism hallelujah hallelujah and here the BM now the Life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word the seed to brings the the seed to life you get it if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed to life oh give the Lord I shout now according to the doctrine that teaching the message which is the Baptist Doctrine nobody had when you believe you have it Peter wasn't supposed to receive nothing upper room he was supposed to say I'm a seed Jesus told me so and I don't need the upper room I gone I going listen when Peter saw Jesus crucified Peter deny you pet say I a stand up for that you know it's three times not once it's three times you know when fire hit him in the upper room he was different you know Chang man you know he a seed was always in his soul but fire hit that and Fire have to hit the seed in your soul glory to God hallelujah mus and come up please brother brandham when that human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty out yourself you mean we have to empty ourselves yes Hallelujah then will be the church in its power Hallelujah his power in his thoughts in his being then the words will become material I believe he on his road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves they don't see themselves they don't have no thoughts but to serve God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit and fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind hallelujah hallelujah glory to God get weak so you can get strong it will conquer every devil it will put the learner to shame it will bring men and women who God has called and that only hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God when you are born again and that light of God shine down into your soul there is no more dark Valley it's a valley with a shadow in it you may have the veil of your flesh and the things known by faith but someday that light and darkness have to separate and when the light shines Darkness flee and when we go to be with Christ in that body dark and death vanishes and we burst out into Perfect Light Hallelujah there be no more sickness there be no more pain right now we have sickness and joy we have health and strengths we have ins and outs we have ups and downs we have joy and sorrow it's a shadow we've got enough light to know Hallelujah but someday the day is going to break and when the death angel set at the door of the bed when the doctor said finished natural comes away from the Supernatural and the light spring back to light and darkness Go Back to Darkness and this Mortal puts on immortality that is when corruption put on incorruption that is when mortal put on immortality that's when they come from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity you cannot go out of here with Darkness you have got to have light in darkness Hallelujah that's the body we receive woo my God final quote Oh Glory to God glory to God hallelujah you become a light listen to this now brother Westward leading still proceeding is a song We Three Kings of Hallelujah travel from my lands of Far

group three please meet with Brother Andy Henry after the service and next week Sunday Lord willing group five is scheduled to serve which is brother Blackman's group and last but not least there have been some inquiries into the convention ition for next year so one the convention is on by the grace of God and there have already been questions around pledges and commitments for the convention so bovid wanted me to let you know that from next Sunday if you want to make commitments for the convention next year uh we will open it uh from next Sunday and looking to see what God will do in the upcoming convention in 2025 it's I said to my wife this morning I don't know where 2024 went this year just disappeared and time it just feels like it's just moving so fast I was saying to someone BR punch back when I was in secondary school I was looking you know back then they were talking about Y2K and you know all these things and thinking that we wouldn't even be here then and to see how God has used time as a great equalizer and a great test to see who would stand and we see all of the things happening in the world in the natural in the spiritual in the economics in the government and everything was preaching about today and to see that you are still standing your wing might be a little twisted but you're still standing you're still a eagle you have some Battle Scars but you're still a eagle you've been through some mountains and some valleys but you're still a eagle and you're still standing and by the grace of the lord we are looking to be under expectation for what God will do because God could never lie and his promise is always true so we know there's a promise of healing that's hanging over the body there's a promise of Revival that's hanging over the body there's a promise of Deliverance that's hanging over the body there's a promise of restoration that's that's hanging over the body there's a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's hanging over the body and one of these days as brother said when brother Sabu said something came over him something going to come over you and it will not be you no more it'll be that word seed in you that's been quickened unto life and that seed will just pulsate something on the inside and the devil didn't put it there and he could never take it away so stay encouraged stay on Fire have a blessed Christmas have a wonderful time stay in the spirit make sure he's the reason for the season and we look forward to closing out this here with a shout next Sunday Lord willing and for all Year's night
