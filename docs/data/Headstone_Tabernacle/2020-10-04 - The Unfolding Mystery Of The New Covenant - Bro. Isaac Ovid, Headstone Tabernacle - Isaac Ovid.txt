connected lord and lord this unseen realm in the supernatural way all things are possible and lord we are so grateful that we could be able to have fellowship lord around your sacred word father that you could speak to our hearts and you could walk out from the pages of the bible and reveal yourself to us lord you know in the way you want us to hear from you today lord we are so unworthy lord but your grace and your love and your mercy lord and your power lord and your foreknowledge and your predestination lord and the way you work things out lord had it that we lord we didn't find you but you found us father so we thank you this morning lord for the privilege to be called in such a time as this lord when the world is struggling with anxiety and men's hearts failing for fear and lord people are looking for solutions father but we understand that natural solutions could never solve lord's spiritual problems but lord you made a way or made a way of escape you made a way for us to reconnect with you you made a way for us to contact you you made a way that we could have fellowship so lord may you speak to us this morning lord may you open our understanding to the scriptures and may you bless the service today lord and even as the word goes forth father lord if is anyone sick may they be healed if there's anyone backslidden father may they come to know you by revelation and by inspiration lord may you bless each one today as we approach today's service in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning uh in this unconventional way but we thank god for his grace and his mercy to us amen so thank you so much but anthony thank you so much musicians so i'd like to go straight to the world this morning greetings to one and all uh both those who are part of this assembly and our friends who would connect or would hear the tape may god richly bless you and strengthen you during this season i certainly want to salute our precious pastor but ovid in particular for not just leadership but for the messages that he has been ministering and for every service and every opportunity we get to gather together in our different ways using technology to be able to cut through the noise as it were and to fight and to contend to be ready for when he comes you feel that way this morning so we thank god and i encourage you you know uh since most are connected that you make it make it a reverent moment make it a solemn moment make it a sincere moment don't approach it casually don't relax but let's approach it understanding that god is real god is here and he's not limited uh by you physically being in this room but he's able to meet you at the point of your need this morning so i have uh three portions of scripture that i'd like to go to this morning reading the book of psalms reading from the book of hebrews and reading from peter the lord helped us this morning a little encouragement to the church this morning to encourage you along your journey as you contend for the fate and you go through this process of character development through the trials and the testings and we are here to remind you this morning of the promises of god amen so reading from psalms 105 and reading from verse 8 he hath remembered his covenant forever that's powerful he had remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations that alone is a powerful scripture which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto abe unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for allah and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few in number yey very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm and reading hebrews 13 and reading verse 20 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen and reading first peter two and reading verse nine we kind of touched a little bit on this in our bible study but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show for the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had up had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord and we're so grateful to be able to be in fellowship around the word of god and uh we'll see what lord will do this morning he is in complete control he knows what he wants to say to us this morning so i have a title this morning the unfolding mystery of the new covenant the unfolding mystery of the new covenant subject i will make an everlasting covenant with you and an inspiration a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people can the church say amen so the unfolding mystery of the new covenant by using the word unfolding we mean it's something else is coming out of it there's something that's opening up to us there's something being revealed to us our understanding is increasing our experience is increasing and god said i'll make an everlasting covenant with you this this covenant will have no end there'll be no need for another covenant when this everlasting covenant is in place when this new covenant is in place there'll be no need for another covenant he said on and and we read a scripture in peter who is this you he's talking about a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people so let's uh get into it this morning and we know that god is a god of laws he's a god of principles he's a god of promises he's a god of judgments and by his own word and we know that god is objective worship but by his own word god even placed limits on himself can the church say amen so by god's own word there are certain things that god cannot do can the church say amen so god we know he cannot lie we know god cannot change we know that god cannot make a promise and fail to bring it to pass oh that is what makes him god because he is not able to make a promise and take it back but he's also a god of covenants and when god makes a covenant oh that covenant is so powerful that is an unbreakable covenant can the church say amen and we know that there's a difference with the old covenants and there was a a challenge with the old covenants we're gonna touch some of it but we understand that in the old days in the days of of abraham and the days of moses and and as you progress through the days before jesus came they lived under the old covenant god had covenants with many of his sons throughout the years he made a covenant with noah that i'm not going to do what i did with the flood anymore he made covenants with abraham he made covenants with moses he made covenants with david can the church say amen but the old covenant provided a sacrificial system because sin required debt so god knew that something had to be in place to deal with the sin situation because sin was automatically gonna lead to death so god created a system and place and under that old system under that old covenant you have to find a lamb you have to find something and you have to make a sacrifice isn't that right and that grew to the high priest having to go on the day of the atonement and make sacrifice for the people but the problem with that system was that sacrifice was only covering the problem it was not removing the problem so every single year you had to go back again and again the fact that that system was designed to go back again and again meant that the people were going through a cycle they were going through this up and down one minute you're on top of the mountain because you feel victory when the high priest comes out and say yes we have been redeemed from the last year yes the sins have been taken care of and now they go into a new year and god that covenant that he had in place was a temporary covenant there was a purpose for the covenant but it was a temporary covenant can the church say amen i'm just laying a background before i get to preach this morning so in that covenant the high priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of the people and represent them in the presence of god the blood of bulls and goats was temporarily enabling them to remain in fellowship with god the old covenant was filled with grace it had mercy it had long suffering but that had to happen over and over and we know in hebrews it is impossible for the blood of bulls and gods to take away the sin can the church say amen but the deeper issue with the old covenant was that the old covenant was unable to supply the power oh come on are we getting somewhere now the old covenant was covering sin but it was unable to supply the power that people would need to be able to live the way god wanted the law of moses was filled with thou shalt not and thou shalt and do this and don't do this do this and don't do this but there was nothing in the law that would give you power to overcome oh somebody helped me this morning the law was laying out what had to be done and how you had to live but god was not satisfied which has given the law he wanted to bring power to the people so that they could live with power live under the anointing live with our unsung to be able to fight every devil oh can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the lord told them what they could do and what they could not do but it never had anything in the law to give them the spiritual power and if there's ever a need for spiritual power this is the day that we need spiritual power can the church amen hey many many men and more importantly that old covenant the old covenant had a built-in expiry date oh hallelujah hallelujah because they were just shadows of what was to come they were just hinting at what was to come it was designed with an expiry date so god knew that one day the old covenant there were attributes of it not that he was throwing it out but he was given a further revelation because blood was still required but this time not just the blood of bulls and goats but there was going to come one oh hallelujah that one sacrifice would be enough for your sins one sacrifice will be enough for my sins no more every year going in for an atonement but by one can the church say amen oh blessed be the name of the lord i just want to build a little bit so i want to take my time and go through some scriptures and go through some little teaching and bring in a few things here to encourage you a little bit with the foundation of some of the covenants and how the switch take place the unfolding mystery of the new covenant because without this new covenant you and i will have a chance without the new covenant we would not have a place oh come on now but to see how way back there god placed you and i in there and he placed a prophecy in there so that we could have a chance now if we have a reason to shout we have a reason to be excited we have a reason to be to be encouraged this morning so from the message hebrews chapter 7 2 but the random is saying here and i'm going to read a little bit god be blessed forever of a son that continued forever after the order of melchizedek he never had a beginning he never has an end and the law could not produce nothing like that because it was carnal the church cannot produce nothing like that the denominations because they are carnal the seminaries can never produce it they try to educate the world they try to organize it to it they've tried every way in the world to make everything they could and leaving off the main thing which is and listen to the prophet you got to be born in it god makes you what you are certainly not because you quit doing this can the church say amen oh blessed be the name of the lord listen now you might not even know your abc's you might not know coffee from spit peas you might know not know g from right from left hand it don't make any difference what you don't know there's one thing you must know that jesus christ took your place as a sinner oh can the church say amen and you take your place to stand in his righteousness confessing every day that you are wrong and love him with all your heart and your whole motives be set towards him you'll make heaven there's all that's all there is to it for the life that was in christ has to be in you or you're lost so we're not talking about being in church we're not talking about being in the message we're talking about the life that was in christ has to be in you or you're lost and we know how brother branham brought it out when they offered the lamb as a sacrifice and they slit the truth and that life was leaving the animal it should have been a transfer of life but that life in the animal was not compatible with our life so it was bypassing us all along but when jesus died and brother branham said god ripped the covenant into he separated the spirit so that the spirit could fall on you and i so now we can have spirit the holy spirit itself operating through us can the church say amen oh hallelujah now listen to the prophet now just before closing i'm not closing he is saying this do you remember the unconditional covenant that god made with abraham what did he do that evening when god said let me see sixteenth chapter but ibrahim is gonna dramatize it so i wanna bring it out and remind you about it he said come here abraham and he took abraham he said go get me a ram go get me your goat go get me a heifer i want you to take them up here and make a sacrifice and abraham went and got the sheep and the goat and the lamb or the heifer he killed them there was all clean sacrifices and split them halfway in two and he laid them out then he went and got two turtle doves and pitched them in then abraham watched the birds off of them in other words he was fanning away every attack on the sacrifice then abraham watched the birds waiting for god to come now lord there's a sacrifice how are you going to do this i don't know how you're going to save man against his own will but ibrahim is dramatizing it i don't know how you're going to do this how can you do it lord and lord said now watch abraham you're a prophet you are spiritual and you'll understand what i'm talking about all right lord i want to see but i said now i'm just traumatizing so abraham you come up here now and sit down and watch them burst off so he shooed all the birds away until the sun started to go down are you with me this morning come on now let's write the anointing and the first thing you know god came down and when he came now abraham began to feel sleepy god said abraham i'm going to put you to sleep now listen legalist friend i'm reading from the prophet see god took abraham completely out of the picture nothing at all he had to do into it and that's the way he got you you said oh i saw god you didn't god sought you no man can come to me except the father draws him first so you are not here this morning by your own choosing you are not here this morning by your own desire no man can come except the father draws him first it's god seeking you not you seeking god you never did do it your nature is wrong you're a pig you don't know any different you just live in the pig pen that's all you know you love it but abandon said drink beer swapping around run around with the next man's wife and doing everything you can do is evil or brother you think it's good but god knocks at your heart and that's what changes not you knocking at god god knocks at you adam never knocked at god's heart god knocked at adam's heart and you are son of adam that's right before adam could be a son of god again god had to knock on his heart and before you could be a son of god again god has to knock on your heart and he's knocking on hearts this morning oh that's a quote from the prophet he's knocking on your heart mama he's knocking on your heart pop up he's knocking on your heart brother he's knocking on your heart sister oh he said behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man oh come on now are we in the world this morning he is knocking he is seeking he is hunting he is not going to lose one because it's a covenant oh and with a covenant he's a covenanted people and there's the angel of the covenant to ensure that the covenant is enforced all this covenant is more powerful than your past this covenant is more powerful than your mistakes this covenant is more powerful than your failures this covenant is more powerful than whatever the devil could bring to you this morning it's a powerful covenant and god cannot break his word oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he swore by himself oh i might get to the core but the pranam said when you swear you swear by something greater than yourself that's what make the covenant up an enforceable powerful thing but when god looked to the left when he looked to the right he tried to find somebody that was greater than himself that he could swear by and when he found nobody greater he swore by himself because there was nobody greater than himself and he swore that there'll be a bribe he swore that every seed shall possess the gates of the enemy he swore that the seeds of abraham would come into power can the church see amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh encourage yourself shake yourself this morning oh come on now oh shake square your shoulders lift your head up you are covenant people you are covenant people you are walking in the covenant it's because of the covenant you are alive it's because of the covenant you can be set free it's because of the covenant oh can the church say amen oh we're going to go a little deeper we're still laying our coat and butter adam said and abraham went to sleep and when he went to sleep what was the first thing he saw a real horrible spooky dread darkness that's death that comes upon the whole human race then he looked a little farther than that and he saw a smoking furnace before you can have smoke you have to have fire that's the reason i believe in hell as a burning place he showed every one of us is subject to death and every one of us should go to hell because we are sinners do you get that this morning that we are supposed to go to hell because of sin but now but beyond that he saw a little white light and this little white light what is the light with the branham's head what was that white light that pillar of fire that went before the children of israel the pillar of fire that met paul on the road down to damascus the pillar of fire that took peter out of prison the pillar of fire that's here tonight and i say that pillar of fire is here this morning that pillar of fire is over your house that pillar of fire is over your family that pillar of fire is over your children that pillar of fire is over this church that pillar of fire is over the world this morning and he's going to bring the world to pass he's going to bring the covenant to pass oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm still building a background oh hallelujah we haven't started yet so get warmed up get ready lift your shoulders lift your head up we are going somewhere this morning i'm gonna show you that it is impossible for the bride to miss the rapture it's impossible for you to miss the holy ghost it's impossible for you to miss your adoption it's impossible for your family to be left on the outside because this covenant is for you and it's for your children and it's for them that are far off i don't care how fine the world they are this covenant has power to pull them back in can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm with the random ghost and i'm still in that quote that eternal everlasting god he himself walked between these split sacrifices oh my the prophet says back and forth on each one and by the branham is dramatizing he said this is how i'm gonna do it abraham watch me watch what am i going to do i'm making a covenant here and i'll take an oath that according to thy seed oh hallelujah mine and according to the seed i'll raise up an intercessor i'll make a covenant with death now a covenant is an agreement a covenant is a contract a covenant is a formal agreement he said i'll make a covenant with debt and i'll condemn that in other words he made an agreement to tell death i'm going to condemn you so it's not just a covenant for your blessing you know he made a covenant with that i'll condemn debt in the flesh because i myself will come take it abraham said through your seed abraham will come you'll be the father of the world through your seed and not only you do i make this promise with you but your seed after you he knew everyone would be not them not but what i do i'm going to do it abraham i trusted abraham and he broke his and everyone breaks theirs but i make this with myself and swear by myself can the church say many many many many many men oh hallelujah i'm gonna bring in that message he went on to speak about the way that different people make covenants he says how some people in america you shake hands and that's the covenant can the church say man oh hallelujah hallelujah um i'll give an example he said now watch how they make a covenant in japan we make you do so and so and i'll do so and so we take a little pinch of salt because salt is a savor and we take salt and i throw it on brother neville and we're gonna never take salt and throw it on unto me that's a binding covenant oh hallelujah i'm with the bran was just bringing out examples of these different covenants and these different agreements can the church say amen how did they do it in the oriental time they made an oath one to another they killed a beast split it open stood right in between and two men stood between it and the split beast can the church say amen and they drawed up a covenant if i fail to keep this if i fail to do this why this and so and so let my body be like this dead beast let my body be like this and when they do that they take this covenant and stand between this make an oat and they'll do it and they tear the people together apart and hand it to one man the other one the next at a certain time they'll meet and let them die the debt if they fail to keep the oath can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now notice i'm still in a foundation the tree beast the perfect lamb god the tree perfect sacrifice what was the lamb what was the turtle dove and what was the two turtle doves meant the two turtle doves was sacrificed for both salvation and healing see the atonement was made different but healing continued at the same and so did salvation continue the same the two turtle doves not divided men they are represented both by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed up they were laid on the side not separated but the covenant can you see watch what god was telling abraham at calvary according to your seed out of you come isaac out of isaac come so and so jacob out of jacob come joseph out of joseph on down on down successor still finally threw that righteous seed he just got through here saying that our lord sprung out of a nation that knowed not moses never even spoke of it come out of the priesthood our lord sprung out out of the tribe of judah not out of levi for they were kana legalists we're going to touch a little later but our lord come out of judah there you are where the promise was made oh hallelujah listen close now i'm almost finished this quote as we close at calvary god come down and took the body of his own son in which he had lived and he ripped it apart at calvary his bleeding wounded cut and the spear run in there and ripped him apart and his blood crushed out and he said father into thy hand i commend my spirit he bowed his head and the earth shook and the lightnings flashed and the thunders roared god was writing his everlasting covenant can the church say amen so on calvary he said god was writing his everlasting covenant this was not a temporary thing this was the everlasting covenant and he took his dead body from the grave on the first day of the week and brought it up into heaven and sat it there as the high priest as a memorial setting there perfect forever and he sent the spirit that he tore out of that body right back down in the church and that church would have to have the same spirit that was in that body oh it won't dovetail with it in the resurrection these two pieces must perfectly come must come perfectly together and if this church listen to the challenge isn't perfectly just exactly the same spirit that was in christ you'll never go in the rapture let me say that one more time and if this church isn't perfectly just exactly the same spirit that was in christ you'll never go in the rapture there's your everlasting covenant brother seek it out yourself what's in your heart love the lord really be sure that you're saved don't take a chance on it you're gambling oh you we american people love to gamble but don't you gamble on that you'll be sure that you're right not because you joined church but because you're truly born again christ has come to you in the person of the holy ghost so you see i'm connecting to what brother has been preaching what the holy ghost has given for the need for the holy ghost it's not about church membership it's not about church attendance but it's about that life being changed about the holy ghost being perfectly what jesus had not an experience and just a touch but the same signs the same life the same wonders the same behavior the same nature the same being the same attitude attributes his same desires come the church same am so we going through so we know god started he started to build his work because when man fell god realized that man could not redeem himself god always knew that man could not restore himself so god had to put something in place when adam broke that original covenant that existed oh he knew god god knew he had to make a way that if he did not make a way there'd be no hope for us can the church say amen if god doesn't make a way our best efforts would not be good enough so god started to build again and through the ages he's building he is building and he's dropping promises dropping promises he is dropping inspiration he's dropping covenants he's dropping promises so that the people can keep pressing oh and that's what we're doing this morning reminding you of the promise reminding you of the covenant reminding you so you could have confidence to face the workday you could have confidence to deal with your family you could have confidence to look sickness in the face and said i am under a covenant oh sickness get away from me you can look death in the face and say i'm under a covenant oh debt you already defeated there's a covenant already with you that has been enforced by jesus christ oh hallelujah debt where's your sting grave where's your victory i'm under a covenant and in that covenant is the holy ghost in that covenant is power in that covenant is dynamic some in that covenant is the revival in that covenant seven living voices in that new covenant oh can the church say amen the old covenant was temporary it could only carry you so far but when jesus came he introduced a new covenant oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated let's see how god built it to see how god operates and maybe this will be an encouragement to you in exodus 2 24 the bible says and god heard their groaning we're talking about the children of israel in bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob so god heard their groaning but it was because of a covenant it was not just the groaning that moved him it was when he heard the groaning he was able to enforce something because a covenant was already in place oh glory to god if the oh my if you catch it this morning that is because of the covenant you already have the victory oh those children of israel were in bondage but the covenant was bigger than their bondage the covenant was bigger than pharaoh oh hallelujah all that pharaoh had was no match for the covenant all glory to god all the years they were in bondage was no match for the covenant because the moment god remembered the covenant the covenant went into effect may the covenant come into effect this morning may god as the prophet said confirm the covenant with signs with wonders when miracles and the covenant is hovering over you this morning the covenant is hovering over your house this morning may today be a day for the confirmation of the covenant oh hallelujah the promise that god made to you and your family the promise that god made to preserve you in the hour of temptation that covenant cannot fail he swore by himself oh hallelujah oh forgive me i'm excited because if you ever feel down think about the covenant in your groaning think about the covenant in your down moment think about a covenant god has a covenant with you and your children your children are under the covenant i don't care where they are this morning they are under the covenant oh come on now come on now come on now oh your sickness has to give way to the covenant your depression has to give way to the covenant your mind battles have to give way to the covenant oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord we are building somewhere oh hebrews chapter six but abraham said the covenant that god made with israel they lost their inheritance they lost the promised land and went on into egypt listen to the prophet they lost it and went known into egypt so they got into trouble and there are many people in church that got themselves into trouble many people have found themselves in trouble but listen to how the prophet adjusted he said but they hadn't lost the covenant oh my glory so they were in bondage they lost their liberty but they did not lose the covenant they lost their freedom but they didn't lose their covenant they lost all come on now whatever you lost this morning just know you cannot lose this covenant oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah god said i remember my promise to abraham i remember and i've come down to deliver go down there moses and tell pharaoh that because of my covenant let my people go i remember the covenant i made with abraham unto his seed and to his seed to a thousand generations oh can the church see amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my oh my and god is building because this battle brother sheen started in god's eden and god has a purpose and a plan to destroy the works of darkness and to restore men from this fallen condition this was fallen man having the victory oh the children of israel still had to do their sacrifices but the covenant was enough to keep them going can the church say amen oh i feel religious this morning i want you to remember you cannot lose your covenant or bondage doesn't change your covenant losing focus doesn't change your covenant just connect to the covenant this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah so god is building and i want to speak now so now we're moving we touch on abraham we touch on noah just briefly now we we into moses a little bit and i want to read from the scripture exodus 19. we're going to touch a few scriptures right with me this morning exodus 19 and verse 3 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel and that's how i feel this morning we've come with a word oh to the predestinated we have come with a word this morning to the call out we have come with a word to the elect this morning and listen to verse 4 you have seen what i did unto the egyptians have you seen what god has done to the egyptians have you seen you couldn't be here this morning unless god cut off egyptians that have been in your life you will never chance to be able to connect this service on lord unless the lord didn't make a way for you oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah i prayed it in the prayer meeting on friday night i said if you add up all the reasons that you have to complain if you write them all down and you put next to it all the reasons that you have to be thankful they will always outweigh the reasons to complain oh i can guarantee you this morning if you write down all of your sorrows write on all of your cares write down all of your problems and you could begin to write next to it all of the things that thank god for thank you for waking me up this morning thank you for having a finger if i only have one finger that's more than somebody with no finger there's so much reason to thank god for i got a pain in my shoulder but there's somebody with no shoulder that's a reason to thank god for oh i may not have shoes but thank god i have feet because there's somebody who has no feet oh come on there's a reason to be grateful this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's more reasons to be thankful than to be sad there are more reasons i don't care how bad things are there's more reason to be grateful to god than to be depressed than to be frustrated than to be under the privileges of what god called you for your station blessed be the name of the lord i'm absolutely positive about that i'm not questioning i'm not suggesting it i'm not arguing it you have more reasons to give god a solder praise you have a big reason the fact that your name is in the book he said rejoice not because the demons are subject to you but give god worship because your name is written in heaven if nothing else is right in your life rejoice because your name is written in heaven that's a reason to be excited this morning oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord can we go a little further i'm reading in exodus 19. if you have your bibles you can look reference it with me exodus 19 verse 4 you have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you how i carried you how i lifted you up on eagle's wings and brought you to myself hallelujah now therefore listen to the word of the lord now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant oh hallelujah hallelujah then shall ye be listen a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me listen a kingdom of priests this is the first time you're hearing royalty being combined with priesthood hallelujah oh come on now a kingdom of priest moses i don't even know if moses was understanding the magnitude of what god was speaking because this was not being directed to moses oh hallelujah when you read this you will find this repeated in the new testament come on now let me read it slowly now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then shall you be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be under me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel oh hallelujah hallelujah what did we read from peter oh hallelujah so it was not just peter just saying words peter was quoting what god told moses and moses the next verse said to get gotten get the elders and and and and let the people know we read it in first peter but we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people but this in peter is not even directed to the jews because he's speaking about jews and gentiles but when god is talking to moses because god is everlasting and in god's economy he's not managing by time he is speaking dispensational prophets speaking to people throughout ages can the church say amen you remember our teaching with jehu god told elijah to do something and it was true elijah through elisha through a servant a son of the prophet fulfilled it can the church say amen so here it is god is putting a seed for a certain group of people who are not even there and god is placing us there and speaking to moses he said and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests the kings and the priests didn't mix in the old testament they were from two different tribes so moses was repeating maybe what he didn't even understand a holy nation a peculiar treasure is there and moses came verse 7 and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him can the church say a many many many men everybody feeling fine oh my my my mind so we're building a little bit this is in a message revelation chapter four i'm just dropping some seeds a bill into something now in exodus but ibrahim saying in exodus 23 and hebrews 6 god made a covenant with himself and saw by himself hebrews 1309 13 he swore by himself there was no creator to swear by when he told abraham and isaac there he told abraham that he would make a covenant with him an everlasting covenant a covenant is always made by an oath so there you take an oath by somebody greater than you all right so that's making sure it's there take a note by your mother take a note by your nation taken over by something taken out by god but you can't take an oath unless it's somebody greater than you this is the prophet's teaching and there was nobody greater than god so he took an oath by himself by himself amen swearing by himself that he would confirm this covenant so it's one thing brother papa to have the covenant it's another thing for the covenant to be confirmed oh my god hallelujah oh who swear by it he said he would preserve i'm reading a prophet he will preserve the seed of abraham what is the seed of abraham to the gentile listen to the prophet the baptism of the holy spirit a seed of abraham soar by himself i'll raise them up everyone i'll give them eternal life and place them back here on the ut oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory oh blessed be the name of the lord and we see time moving we're building somewhere this morning we're going somewhere so all of this we're talking about abraham we don't even know we're talking about moses they are speaking under inspiration but they're still under the old covenant so we reached a joshua now and brother anthony preached a message about four years ago the angel of the covenant and he was preaching how joshua was there sharpening his sword reading the scriptures trying to figure out how to take jericho and then the unseen captain of the host or the angel of the covenant the enforcer of the covenant the spirit of the covenant came to give instructions on how to take jericho can the church say amen so god doesn't just have a covenant he has the angel of the covenant and by the branham type the angel of the covenant as christ is the angel of the covenant oh come on now oh hallelujah glory blessed be the name of the lord and through david and to all the ages come down listen to the prophet in the first seal and we know christ is always the messenger to the church he's always a messenger he is called the pillar of fire the angel of the covenant and so forth so you could understand that it's jesus we're talking about oh he is the new covenant he is the holy ghost he is power jesus in me that's what i'm looking for i don't want to the church in me i don't want to just be a church member i want that same life i want that life in me can the church say oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god the unfolding mystery of the new covenant year in year out you have to go make sacrifices every single year and you have to wait the high priest would go in and they would have a cord tied to the high priest they had bells on his clothes so when he walked you hear the sound so if you know the sound then you know he's still alive because you don't know when he goes into the holies of holies if god will accept the sacrifice because if god don't accept the sacrifice he would die in death and nobody could walk in tears because if you walk in there it was dead to go in the way there so they would tie a rope to the high priest so that if they stop hearing the ringing of the bells and if too much time passed they would pull the high priest out of the holies of holies but god said that is not what i want oh hallelujah i want a perfect people i want a perfect bride they need a perfect sacrifice they need a perfect way out of here not something temporary not something that works sometimes and don't work another time i want their joy to be full i want them to have a perfect standing a perfect state i wanted to know their position i wanted to know who they are what can the church say man oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah so powerful that when jesus came oh what it was what a thing how god slipped in so powerfully brother hugh god in his great master plan god in his great plan sent to earth he sent brother brother punch a king he sent a prophet he sent a priest and he sent a sacrifice and wrapped it up in one he sent a multi too talk about dynamite dear in a manger was lying a king a king like no other king dear in a manger was lying a prophet like no other prophet there in a manger was lying a priest like no other priest and at the same time the enemy was laying a sacrifice like no other sacrifice and then a manger was laying the prince of peace and day in a manger was laying the bright and mourning star and there in a manger was laying el shaddai and there in a manger was laying the lord of lords and didn't even know who he was but the new covenant had arrived can the church say amen oh i feel religious if mary only understood what she was holding if joseph only understood when he was walking around the house and that little boy was walking around who he was oh they asked is this joseph's son but they didn't know he was king he was prophet he was priest he was general of generals he was the one he was the fourth man in the fire oh come on now he was six years old and he was a fourth man in the fire seven eight nine ten and the perfect sacrifice watching the ceremony of the atonement watching the high priests go in for all the people oh hallelujah for the new covenant the new covenant the new covenant the new covenant oh we thank god for the new covenant we thank god for the everlasting covenant we thank god for his promises that can never fail we thank god for his word that could never fail we thank god because of this new covenant our sins we'll remember them no more we thank god because of this new covenant our sins get put in a sea of forgetfulness hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah jesus was the first king priest he was the first king priest before him there was no king priest but when jesus came it now became possible for others to be king priests royal priests kingdom of priests do you know who you are i'm not speaking to just soldiers the same way jesus was king and prophet and priests yes your soul is in the army of the lord but you are also priests and not just any kind of priests you are not a levitical priest you are royal priests because a little the levitical priests were not royal priests oh come on now we're building somewhere this morning do you know you are royalty hallelujah oh my what a reason to shout what a reason to worship oh that's what the enemy the enemy's job is to try to tell you're nobody you're nothing but if you wake up wait wait wait wait wait wait who am i who am i i'm a soldier i'm a priest i'm a prince i'm a son and each of these things have jurisdiction and powers attached to them oh come on now as a priest i can offer sacrifice i don't have to wait till i come to church to offer a sacrifice i don't have to wait until a day of atonement to offer sacrifice but in my office as a priest i can offer sacrifice every day oh come on now somebody help me this morning i could offer sacrifice in the morning i could have a sacrifice in the middle of the day because i'm a priest oh hallelujah and i'm a king don't you know you're a king oh come on now come on now because you are kings he is king of kings oh come on now because you are lord you are lord you are rulership you are promised rulership on this earth we shall reign on the earth because you are lords he is a lord of lords oh come on now you he can be a high priest if there are not other priests there could only be a higher priest if there are priests to be higher than but he is a high priest over priests i'm speaking the priests i'm speaking to kings i'm speaking to sons and daughters of the living god who are getting the skills off of the eyes with their dominion with their power with their promise and most importantly with the new covenant even the eternal everlasting powerful covenant can the church say amen oh blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my blessed be the name of the lord everybody feeling fine oh hallelujah oh andre madam said in the unconditional covenant that god made with the people what a beautiful picture of god making his covenant with the church when jesus christ went to calvary who was god emmanuel god ripped him apart at calvary tore the covenant in two took the body up to his right hand and send the holy ghost back to the church and the same spirit is in the church today and the same holy ghost hallelujah that was back there has to be the same holy ghost oh when we come together making jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah give the lord a shout our praise give the lord worship this morning oh hallelujah in the exposition of the seven church ages but abraham said jacob alone had the seed hallelujah so we said all the time you are not a believer the word in you that seed in you is the believer so although jacob had his issues oh there was a seed in jacob and the man said jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of god and brethren said if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and for your age can the church say man oh my my my my everybody feeling fine so we read the scripture about priests and royal priesthood and that's our promise that's who you are holy nation peculiar people world can't figure you out and we were doing a bible study on peter and peter was uniquely positioned to be able to write this because i want you to catch this as well jesus is on the earth he is king nobody knows he is prophet even messiah anointed word and nobody understands he is not a priest he is to be the high priest he's also the sacrifice but you can't do a sacrifice unless there's a high priest to perform the sacrifice but in that day when jesus is there there's carefuls and caiaphas is high priest under the law if there's a sitting high priest the high priest is supposed to perform the sacrifice jesus is the sacrifice they don't understand who he is they don't know that he the sacrifice the perfect sacrifice is there but this high priest caiaphas he is clueless he is blind to the fact that the perfect sacrifice is there so god has ways he connects the dots to work things out for the whole picture to fall in place are you with me this morning so can i take you back to that encounter let's go back to matthew 26 and verse 57. so here it is jesus he's being moved from place to place as it were they're trying to figure it figure out who he is what he is what his ministry is isn't that right and matthew 26 37 and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled so we see a picture being painted here's the high priest here the scribes here are the elders they are sitting there in their seats of power as it were and they bring this mystery oh they bring this mystery in front of the high priest this man was a man of the people now he is getting closer and closer to completing the great mystery of switching from the old covenant to the new covenant anybody with me this morning the next verse verse 58 but peter followed him afar off so we know is one person for sure witnessing what about to happen anybody with me this morning but peter followed him afar off onto the high priest palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end oh my oh my anybody with me this morning peter don't know what's happening peter has been following peter has been faithful to the best he could peter is seeing things that he could hardly understand because he really needs a new covenant to unlock the new power to unlock the holy ghost so that he could be transformed can the church say man anybody with me this morning just a little a little teaching here no the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death but found none they were trying to find something to stick on jesus but they couldn't find none ye though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answer it doubt nothing what is it with these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him are you jervy by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god and jesus saith unto him thou has said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall you see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven so i want you to see the whole play out here god already sees this holding play out and the bible said in verse 65 that then the high priest rent his clothes saying he had spoken blasphemy what for the need have we of witnesses behold you have heard this his blasphemy and in that moment there's a i want to call it a transfer of power in that very moment because we're getting closer to the hour of sacrifice isn't that right now i want to go back to leviticus 21. in leviticus 21 verse 10 if you have it or you can reach it the bible says and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on the garments shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes so in that moment so there's a levitical law that is enforced there so care of us without understanding the magnitude of what is happening in front of him when caiaphas ripped his clothes he disqualified himself as high priest can the church say man he disqualified himself as high priest and a high priest who was looking at this earthly high priest was able to take on the mantle for the sacrifice come on now anybody with me this morning to see how god unfolds it to see how scared of us didn't even understand the peace he was playing that he was just temporary so jesus left there there was no high priest sitting down to perform the sacrifice and here it was the high priest and the sacrifice was being led away oh come on now oh because this new covenant could not be handled by the hands of man this new ministry was not for man to be involved with it was god himself he was king he is prophet he is priesthood he is sacrificed coming to claim the ears of redemption and enforce the everlasting covenant enforce the new covenant oh hallelujah oh hallelujah prophesied through the ages prophesied through prophets can the church say man oh could he take some more oh hallelujah i didn't want to pick up some more pieces so everything had been pointed at this moment by the sheen everything i've been pointing away from man walking in and doing sacrifice everything had been pouring away god was ending it god was shutting it down oh holiday the same way oh caiaphas rent his clothes it's the same way that the veil in the temple was ran from top to bottom forever abolishing that old structure forever abolishing that old way to lead to the new king priests the royal priests the kingdom of priests sons who were kings and priests oh hallelujah hallelujah and it's reinforced reinforced through scripture oh hallelujah could you take some more then we're gonna pull some pieces together in jeremiah 31 31 behold the days come say the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah hallelujah a new covenant with the house of israel and the house of judah even it's picked up in a new testament that jesus didn't come as expected at all because priests came from the tribe of levi not just from the tribe of levi but the order of priesthood was the the ironic order sons of iran but jesus was not from the tribe of levite he was from the tribe of judah so god made it possible for a high priest to sit who was not a levite making it possible for gentiles to sit as priests oh i don't know if you're catching this this morning oh hallelujah listen to jeremiah behold the days come say the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they break although i was an husband unto them sayeth the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days seared the lord i will put listen now before this the law was outside but i will put my law in their inward paths hallelujah so we're not talking about the written on the on the ten commandments not written outside but the inward parts and write it in their hearts oh god help us this morning and we'll be their god and they shall be my people hallelujah the covenant will switch from an external covenant to an eternal covenant written on your heart so if your hand not there your heart still have it if you lose your head your heart still have it you could be crippled this morning but in your heart the covenant is more powerful so that your gray hair could turn back black because the covenant is in your heart it's deep in your soul [Applause] hallelujah but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days said the lord i personal singular pronoun will put my law it will not be a minister to do it i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory everybody feeling fine hebrews 9. we get in it from the scriptures we get it through the prophet right and this really it's scriptures we know we know these things but when you when you when the holy spirit comes and and the great scientist begins to mix this thing together i'm beginning to show you rightly divining the word for your season so you can understand that there's no accident with god there's no mistake with god there's no there's no by chance and hope you're making it god because of his covenant always makes his word come to pass can the church say amen oh hallelujah now we're going to the new testament now amber ibrahim brought our testament is covenant so the new testament itself is the new covenant and the new covenant is the holy ghost hallelujah christ himself the hope of glory living in you the bride to her husband the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my god hebrews 9 then verily the first covenant hebrews 9 verse 1 then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wearing was the candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called a sanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censor and the ark of the covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wearing was the golden pot that had manner and aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant speaking of the ark of the covenant as you see and over at the cherubims of glory shadow in the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly know when these things were thus ordained in other words paul is saying to the hebrews when these things were put in place hallelujah the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplished in the service of god but into the second when the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holy years of all was not yet made manifest wild as the first tabernacle was yet standing in other words the paul is saying that there was a way into the holiest of all but it was not made clear while this first system was in place that in order for this new way to access the holiness of holies to be made possible the old system had to crumble the whole system had to feel which verse nine was a figure or a shadow for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect in other words this whole action of sacrifice under the old covenant could never make you perfect when the sacrifice was done you were clean but you were never perfect but the ministry for this bride to be able to call up the sleeping scenes requires perfection and in order for perfection to be possible the old system had to be abolished can the church say amen as pertaining to the conscious which stood only in meat and drinks and divers washings and cardinal and carnal ordinances imposing them until the until the time of reformation but verse 11 but christ being come and high priest listen of good things to come in other words even when christ came he was a high priest speaking of good things to come that's why it's the unfolding of the new covenant because when jesus came he was pointing that better there's a quote by the bible better better things hallelujah but christ come being a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands in other words but that is the scene not of this building paul is saying neither by the blood of goats and calves but listen by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us i want to read that one more time neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us so in the old days the high priest had to go in with blood jesus as the high priest had to go in with blood also but he went in with his own blood i want you to catch that for a minute in other words without his own blood he himself could not have offered up the sacrifice oh this is you see this so his own blood listen it is by his own blood his blood was the password for him to get in and if his blood was the password for him to get in how much is his blood the password for you and i to enter in you see that if it's good for him if it's good for paul if it's good for silas if it's good for peter if it's good for brother branham if it's good for daniel if it's good it's good enough for me there's power in this wonder working blood oh hallelujah everybody with me this morning he entered in once once by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify it to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who true the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this course he's the mediator of the new testament or the new covenant that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament day which accord might receive the promise of eternal inheritance everybody feeling fine could you take a little more let me kind of try to find a place to wrap this together so we read it just laying it here you understand your promise you understand the journey you understand your ministry and understand how christ made it possible for you to step into your position and how true the ministry after christ through the church ages was unfolding the full clarity of the word so that he would understand what has been happening all along can the church say amen first peter 2 5 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ i want you right now to lift your hands and begin to offer sacrifice we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord wherever you are right i want you to lift your hands and lift up a sacrifice all you priests all these sons and daughters of the lord lift up this sacrifice of praise let's burn incense lord you are worthy lord you are awesome lord you are mighty lord you are king of kings you are lord of lords you you pay the price for us by by one sacrifice and we come as priests also lifting up sacrifice lifting lifting jesus higher oh we welcome your holy spirit we welcome

midst of our situation lord you are still worthy lord you are still mighty lord you are still powerful oh hallelujah hallelujah if you could use anything lord you could use me or cleanse our lips cleanse our hearts oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name on the lord stay in the spirit we are moving somewhere and this here to close the conversation that god had with moses peter in first peter 2 9 says but ye ye are a chosen generation oh no generation was chosen like the ones he's speaking to now you are chosen generation you're not just chosen to be called chosen but you're chosen for a purpose you are chosen generation predestinated them to complete the ministry of jesus christ to unfold the fullness of the new covenant to unfold the fullness of even taking part eternal life oh come on sons and daughters of god come on you priests and kings but you are chosen generation a royal priesthood take your position a priest had to live a certain way in the old testament you have to live a certain way as a priest you're gonna live the way you want to you couldn't go where you wanted to go you couldn't dress how you wanted to dress you couldn't act like how you wanted to act we read it in leviticus the high priest couldn't even rent his garment he couldn't uncover his head there things he could not do if he was gonna stay in office now we are challenged as royal priests if you want to stay in your office you have to live a certain way you have to conduct yourself a certain way you have to speak a certain way your nature your being your attributes your conduct your dress your manner hallelujah you are royal priests a royal priesthood and holy nation holy holy god is holy i was sharing with somebody yesterday you know when you write an exam many examining bodies they mark on something they call the curve they take all the exams and they see and get a point where to get a certain percentage to pass so so somebody passed mark might move from year to year one year is 80 percent the next year is 85 percent the next year 77 but i said not with god his past mark has never moved he said i am holy be holy i am holy oh hallelujah i took your place so you could take my place oh we were the ones to die but he took our sins upon him so that we could take his place and become his righteousness oh hallelujah what manner of conduct must we have but we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people in other words this wasn't always the case that you were chosen this was not always the case but which in time passed were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy oh may the lord bless the reading of his word you feeling fine let me try to find a place to close out i do have a few more oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my so much so much oh hallelujah oh my my my my my that's one of the scripture i want to leave with you i know so many people you don't spend time in the world enough to know where your confidence and strength comes from but if you get them you understand it and you know because like jesus said it is written it is written is also written you need to be prepared to respond because the enemy will not let this word come to you and leave you alone with it he's going to come and test you and challenge you and you have to be prepared because there's war you are kings also not just priests and as a king you have to declare war when the time comes for war hallelujah hebrews 7 11 if therefore perfection and we read it before that if the old system was going to lead to perfection he wouldn't need this new system all right so here in hebrews now hebrews 11 if hebrews 7 verse 11 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law so all the levitical priests could have given was law what further need paul says was therefore another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed hallelujah thank god for the change in the priesthood there is made of necessity as a result of this a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe hallelujah of which no man gave attendance at the altar so paul is saying that this man we're talking about hallelujah came from another tribe of which before him nobody from the tribe of judah ever gave attendance to the altar ever served in this capacity before jesus was breaking multiple records to pave the way for those who come after him to also break their own records he was making it possible for you and i to be what nobody thought we could be to do what nobody thought you could do can the church say amen verse 14. for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah hallelujah of which tribe moses speak nothing concerning priesthood you see it it's there it's written it's all there everything i'm saying is in there he said judah was never the tribe of priests but our lord sprung out of judah and you sprung out the maraval you sprung out a port of spain you sprung out of your country into that line of priesthood your father wasn't a priest your grandfather wasn't a priest but you the elect of god the chosen of god the royal seed of abraham royal priesthood royal priesthood royal priesthood royal priesthood peculiar people holy nation chosen generation that's who you are hallelujah my mom made me move on this just so much so much so much so much oh hallelujah oh my my my i'll skip here in the token token 1963 but it said new testament is new covenant new life shows jesus listen here has met every requirement for us that god required to make us back truly sons and daughters of god under the blood where there is no more condemnation you see this right here this itself is fire notice you nowhere in this conversation let me read it one more time i think you missed it the new testament is new covenant new life shows jesus has met every requirement for us so he met the requirement he took the exam for us we if we took it we would have failed the exam but he took the exam for us that god required to make us back truly sons and daughters of god under the blood where there is no more condemnation so listen i'm trying to blow up in your mind your past and your and all your mistakes and stuff i want to shoot it with a nuclear weapon [Music] no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus walk after the spirit oh come on now be spiritual church oh come on now stand up to your position in god and claim you claim it for you and your family and okay their condition has a lawyer as a king you have authority to claim your family as a priest you have authority to offer sacrifice for your family hallelujah god made it possible for you to do both as a king you could give orders the priest doesn't give orders to armies but the king could give an order so he made you too he made you both priests and kings oh my god help me oh my my my my my oh i feel good you have to forgive me i'm trying to close out somewhere oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord and listen to the prophet in the mercy of the token the bloody lamb is our token tonight in hebrews 13 10 and 20 it is called the everlasting covenant if you'd like to read it god's blood-bound promises made us free from sin and flesh so hold on hold on let's get this right jess his promises alone already makes you free so in other words listen the deliverance for the children of israel was already they were already delivered god already ran through deliverance and make the promise to cover what already happened in his mind you know it's already finished working on so he said god's blood-bound promises made made his past tenser it is a will make made us free from sin and flesh it is an everlasting covenant to worship him and show forth his promised signs so the everlasting covenant includes us having worship and showing hallelujah his promised signs what signs these signs shall follow them that believe when you walk science flying when you walk signs following oh come on now are you with me what doing what confirming the word everywhere they went confirming the word with signs and wonders i'm trying to close out somewhere the new testament is a new covenant in his blood the bible said so the new testament means a new covenant blood life new life talking in us where the all blood stood for a simple sign of the chemistry that the lamb had died listen the holy ghost is the life that was in the person of jesus christ that's displayed in you and i i don't know how much clearer this is he said the holy ghost is the life that was in the person of jesus christ that's displayed in you and i tonight he said outside of that there is no mercy only when i see the blood i'll pass over you but abraham goes on he's pushing now he's touring and may your heart still today i'm trying to press upon your minds friends that the hour has struck that something has got to be done by it we must do something it's either in or out that's all there's only two positions in or out that's all the hour has come where the token must be there if this church ever expects to remain alive until jesus christ comes the token will have to be here that's all this puts an end to doctrine this puts an end to mysteries that puts an end to revelation there's one equal sign however you do the calculation make sure that the equal sign is the token whether you take this route whether you show your workings or not make sure that when it equals it equals the token the token will have to be here that's all and you better really better branham said have the token shining but he always here for the exodus and this time we're going to a promised land the promise of eternal life the token shows that jesus christ the holy ghost shows that jesus has met every requirement for us listen that we are in our nature fallen sons of god and we have no power within us we have no life within us we are a fallen race of people from adam but when listen we can display the token that the word and we become the same shows that jesus christ met the requirement for our sin and death and has displayed his token within us oh how simple it can be you are condemned we were all condemned there is no way to save ourselves and god sent us a token he killed his son at calvary for us and the life that was in that blood when it was shed at calvary has come back to be a token upon us god's everlasting eternal token it's eternal life by the eternal god and anything that had a beginning has an end and everything had a beginning besides god and god is the only form of eternal life there is and when god places his holy spirit in you i'm connecting completely to what brother was preaching and when god places his holy spirit in you which is god and when god places himself within you you as eternal as god is because you're a part of him because you become a son or a daughter of god and you are displaying his word hallelujah i feel religious that's true god identifies it himself you've got eternal life and that's according you and this world is god and that word lives and produces itself just exactly what god has ordained for this age you have it amen the holy ghost the holy spirit be in this place yes sir what is it the holy spirit the word has been quickened to you by the holy spirit to vindicate this age that you have passed from debt unto life and now you are his oh because he is we have the right the right to already purchase for us every promise in the bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you or he didn't think it was going to end up here it's always about a token huh when this token is upon you and god has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment listen now when god has given you i'm reading the prophet when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit notice the use of the word true the fact that the prophet would use the word true means he is dealing with defaults and he's identifying that there's truth and false so when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit then the life of jesus christ is within you so it will mean that if it is not the truth then it is the false because the life not showing in you everybody with me and every theologian will have to admit that to be yes sir it's a new birth you are born anew of the holy ghost and because god has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what god has did then he seals you into his kingdom by the holy spirit and everything that jesus purchased and promised you in the bible is yours it's your property because it's painful i want you to get this prince it's as if you're going to the hardware to pick up some stuff some tiles some doors your umbilical holes you want to get bricks and god come and meet you and hand you the receipt it's paid for just go and collect it you don't have to explain attention you know i come to collect because you have the receipt it's already paid for your healing i have the receipt deliverance i have the receipt my son in trouble i have the receipt my daughter giving trouble i have the receipt my foot in pain here is the receipt come on now proof of purchase it's your property because it's paid for amen life is mine he paid for it life is yours i am reading from the prophet i'm trying to close out musician will get ready healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it heaven is mine even heaven is mine because he paid for it oh hallelujah oh i feel good i feel good i feel good i feel good oh let me read that one more time if you want to rejoice on this he said it's your property because it's paid for and god paid for everything you'd ever need he paid for your family but abraham said life is mine you have to say it i shall not live i shall not die but live life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it this is not a blood of bulls and ghosts now but the perfect sacrifice by the perfect high priest hallelujah healing is yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it heaven is mine he paid for it he has paid the price everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds a token so i want you to get it when jesus paid for these things he appeared for himself you know he doesn't need healing so all the healing he bought it's not for him oh come on now i don't think i want you to catch that this morning it it has no benefit to him he bought all these payments for healing and he don't need healing is there anybody who wants to cash in their receipts for healing oh hallelujah he doesn't need deliverance he is god but he pays for deliverance if there's anybody who wants to take the receipt and take deliverance off the shelf can we walk into the great grocery of god this morning can we walk and begin to put in there whatever we want oh hallelujah oh my my my my mind oh i'm trying to close out now and when this is a big one you want eternal life you receive a token so when the prize has been paid oh it is in the blood it's a token of the blood i'm trying to wind down here oh you could be gonna play something softly as i close out oh hallelujah but abraham here said oh hallelujah hallelujah the old covenant had divine healing how much more has the new covenant got if the old covenant produced it what about the new one when it's a much difficult it's a much better covenant speak of better higher things greater things better things the new covenant oh glory to god this is what god kept for us and now because of a prophet we have the fullness of the revelation of what this new covenant is what is it higher things greater things better things the new covenant oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh listen now like cornelius the we spoke about cornelius right the covenant was in place but the covenant had to be confirmed powerful so as much as cornelius was praying he had to wait until god sent someone to him to confirm the covenant to him by releasing the holy ghost as peter yet spake these words the holy ghost could fall upon him but the new covenant was already in effect because if there was no new covenant then cornelius as a gentile would have no chance but because the new covenant was in effect it is not just know about a new covenant is about the confirmation of the new covenant to you so i don't want you to leave this service talking about the edit the new covenant but the new covenant has to be confirmed to you in the form of your healing in the form of the deliverance of your children that's confirming the new covenant to you the baptism of the holy ghost come from the covenant to you where did the prophet say it listen jehovah jireh now we'll finish that in the scripture this week to prove that to you that this covenant listen has to be confirmed with the royal seed of abraham which are the people out of the gentiles not jews that recruit hallelujah so you see you are all true scripture you are all through the word god designed it this way put things in place that there's no way you could miss it a people out of the gentiles for his name's sake taking it for his name in the messenger jehovah gyra i'm about to close and until he see how the prophet operated and how the prophet understood what he was operating under in jehovah jared that same message he said do you believe he is confirming the covenant and he's ministering now you say here's a lady sitting right here looking at me right behind this man she has got on a red looking dress of some sort red up here sweater it might be she's too far it's dim out there and see that it makes you so weak the whole thing just begins to turn a milky color around through the room which there is times where they see that light she is praying about something if jesus christ will reveal to me what you're praying about will you believe with all your heart you will i'm a stranger to you and you're a stranger to me but you got in contact with the high priest because the signal that he gives me is right over you see see the sign i know it is you have a tremendous nervous trouble that you suffer with and also you got a quieter in the truth and you're suffering if that's right raise your hand say you can see that all right you come you're not from here you come you're not from this country this place you come from memphis that's right the lady's sitting next to you she's also come from memphis do you believe in all your heart lady do you believe that god can heal you do you believe me to be his prophet or his servant that stumbles people see but you believe me to be a servant you believe it's god that's what's doing this talking you know i wouldn't know nothing about you you believe it would be god then all right you believe with all your heart and got what you're suffering with you've got trouble with your throat also and another thing you've got a knot or growth in your side do you believe that god can tell me which side it's in if it is raise up your hand if i tell you the truth if it's in the right side see see do you believe god can tell me who you are will that help you you see what a prophet is doing best building fate if i tell you where you come from will you believe me if i tell you what your secret if i tell you what else you're sick with tell me what side you say if i tell your name will you believe me whoa what is with the bronyman he's in the covenant watch it now do you believe god can tell me who you are will that help you you are mrs cox that's right see go back see do you believe all you believe now see amber ibrahim says that's the confirming of the covenant to the seed of abraham if you can believe oh glory to god the confirmation of this great covenant this everlasting covenant hallelujah to a chosen generation a royal priesthood holy nation a peculiar people just two more quotes in the exposition of the seven church ages but abraham said don't fear john don't fail at the flock all that i am you are here too all that i am belongs to you it's yours church it's yours little bride don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never feel glory to god oh my last quote i made it with anthony from the token it's an everlasting covenant he said why was that called eternal covenant because it wouldn't be eternal when we're redeemed it's all over then it's an everlasting covenant which means certain amount of time till time is out there'll never be another one when time runs out we won't need no more covenant oh we are counting down to the last few seconds to blend from time to eternity and when that zero always struck and time is run out there's no more covenant needed because we blend from time with eternity and only perfect love will take you over there mrs jesus christ church of the living god may god bless you and may god continue to unfold the mystery of this new covenant to you your place in christ your adoption even to your perfection which was not possible under the old covenant but under the new you can be perfect even as your
