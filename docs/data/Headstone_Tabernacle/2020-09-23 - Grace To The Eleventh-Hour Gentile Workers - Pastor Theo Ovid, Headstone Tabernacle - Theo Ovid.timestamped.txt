[25:18] and matthew 5 we want to read verse 6.
[25:23] readings in john matthew 20 rather
[25:26] from verse one and the kingdom for the
[25:28] kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
[25:30] that is a householder which went out
[25:32] early in the morning
[25:33] to hire laborers into his vineyard and
[25:36] when he had agreed with the laborers for
[25:39] a penny a day
[25:40] he sent them into his vineyard and he
[25:43] went out about
[25:46] the third hour and saw others standing
[25:48] idle in the marketplace
[25:50] and said unto them go ye also into the
[25:52] vineyard and
[25:53] whatsoever is right i will give you and
[25:55] they went away
[25:57] again he went out about the sixth and
[25:59] ninth hour and then likewise about
[26:01] eleventh hour
[26:02] he went out and found others standing
[26:05] idle
[26:06] says unto them why stanley here all the
[26:08] day idle they said unto him because no
[26:11] man
[26:11] had hired us we he said unto them go ye
[26:14] also
[26:15] into the vineyard and whatever is right
[26:16] that shall you receive
[26:19] so when evil was come the lord of the
[26:21] vineyard
[26:22] is cured call the laborers
[26:26] give them they hire beginning from the
[26:29] last
[26:30] on to the first when they came that were
[26:34] hired about the 11th hour they received
[26:36] every man
[26:37] a penny and when the first came they
[26:39] supposed
[26:40] that they should have received more and
[26:43] they likewise receive every man
[26:45] a penny when they had received at the
[26:48] moment against the good man
[26:50] of the house saying these last have
[26:52] wrought but one hour
[26:54] and hours made them equal under us which
[26:57] have borne the burden
[26:58] and the heat of the day and he answered
[27:00] one of them and said friend
[27:02] i do no wrong just not thou agree with
[27:05] me
[27:06] for a penny take the thine is and go thy
[27:09] way
[27:10] i will give unto this last eve mazantasy
[27:13] is it not lawful for me to do what i
[27:16] will with my own
[27:17] is thine i even because i am good so the
[27:20] last
[27:21] shall be first and the first last
[27:24] for many be called but few
[27:27] chosen and from john 7 37
[27:31] and the last day that great day of the
[27:32] feast jesus stood and cried
[27:34] saying if any man tooth let him come
[27:38] unto me
[27:39] and drink he that believe it on me
[27:42] as the scripture had said out of his
[27:45] belly shall flow
[27:46] rivers of living water but this speak he
[27:50] of the spirit which they that believe on
[27:53] him
[27:54] should receive for the holy ghost was
[27:57] not yet given
[27:58] because jesus was not yet glorified
[28:02] on our last scripture blessed that day
[28:05] listen matthew 5 6 which do hunger and
[28:07] tears after righteousness
[28:09] for it shall be filled father we thank
[28:11] you once more for this word blessed
[28:13] interpret our hearts
[28:14] in jesus name i ask it amen and amen
[28:16] even be seated
[28:18] praise the name of the lord god bless
[28:19] you blessed be the name
[28:22] of the lord it's great to be here
[28:26] and uh in acts chapter 19
[28:30] and the scripture paul passed through
[28:32] the upper course of ephesus
[28:33] and finances and disciples he said to
[28:35] them have you received the holy ghost
[28:37] since you believed and they
[28:39] said unto them but we have not so much
[28:41] i've heard there be
[28:42] any holy ghost he said to them and to
[28:45] what then were you baptized and they
[28:47] said unto john baptism
[28:48] and then said paul john verily baptized
[28:51] with the baptism of repentance seen
[28:53] unto the people that they should believe
[28:55] on him which should come after him that
[28:57] is on
[28:58] christ jesus and when they heard this
[29:00] they were baptized
[29:02] in the name of the lord jesus and when
[29:03] paul had laid his hands upon them
[29:06] listen the holy ghost came on
[29:09] them and they speak with tongues
[29:12] and prophesied oh please praise the name
[29:14] of the lord and that was the team
[29:16] of the apostles have you received the
[29:18] holy ghost
[29:19] since you believe amen tonight have a
[29:22] title grace
[29:23] to the eleventh our gentile workers
[29:25] that's the title tonight grace
[29:27] to the 11th hour gentile workers the
[29:29] trust you edify
[29:31] by the message on sunday and the
[29:33] instructions given
[29:35] are you meant to press on for that holy
[29:37] ghost
[29:38] and the message recognizing this message
[29:40] he was talking about
[29:41] uh there was a feast of pentecost
[29:44] and between the feast of pentecost and
[29:46] the feast of the trumpets
[29:48] was a long period of time 50 days
[29:52] and 50 pentecost means 50 and the first
[29:55] fruits of the harvest was brought in
[29:57] and we see it in a tight back there with
[29:59] the natural first fruit
[30:00] represent the first fruits of the holy
[30:03] spirit to be poured upon the people
[30:05] and we find out then that them 50 days
[30:08] was received by the gentiles
[30:11] which god called the gentiles a people
[30:14] for his name
[30:16] the feast of pentacles now
[30:19] listen listen and we
[30:22] have been going through that long
[30:26] feast of pentecost which represent
[30:30] seven is not right seven sabbats now
[30:32] actually
[30:34] the from the 50 days will exactly be
[30:36] seven sabbats
[30:38] and seven sabbaths represent seven
[30:40] church ages
[30:41] to be called in the time of the
[30:44] pentecostal feasts
[30:46] to call up people from the gentiles
[30:49] for his name so this period of time
[30:52] is 50 in 50 of seven
[30:55] sevens 72 changes and in that
[30:59] period of time is the times of the
[31:02] gentiles
[31:03] to be called out he called it this long
[31:07] feast of pentecost now at the
[31:10] end of these seven sabbaths there
[31:13] was to be the day of atonement which was
[31:16] the seven trumpets
[31:17] and we know that connected with the jews
[31:19] that they would mourn
[31:20] the one that they rejected even christ
[31:22] and the seven trumpets was to call a day
[31:24] of mourning
[31:26] back to the sacrifice or the atonement
[31:28] and we find out
[31:30] that israel the seven trumpets pertain
[31:32] only to israel
[31:34] the times of the gentiles
[31:37] has been in this pentecostal
[31:40] feast it has no other time remaining
[31:44] just the times of the gentiles and
[31:47] that's what
[31:48] the terminology that god referred to us
[31:50] as gentiles
[31:51] not a specific time but the times of the
[31:54] gentiles
[31:55] the bible even talked talk about it
[31:56] until the fullness of the gentiles come
[31:59] in so once that time is over which is
[32:02] this
[32:02] long feast which represents seven
[32:05] churches
[32:06] then god goes back to the jews now he
[32:08] said he opened the seals under the sixth
[32:11] seal
[32:11] the seven trumpets sung under the sixth
[32:14] seal because we know that the seventh
[32:15] seal
[32:16] is silence it's christ coming down in
[32:18] secret coming down to call our bride out
[32:20] so now here you go here we go now then
[32:23] the prophet broke here now
[32:25] now the seventh angel's message
[32:28] is to open the mystery of the seals
[32:33] calling the 11 hour gentile workers to
[32:36] receive the same pay
[32:37] that the first hour workers got that is
[32:40] the whole objective what is it for
[32:43] outside of the opening of the seals we
[32:45] will just be another denominational
[32:47] group
[32:47] another nominational following or
[32:50] whatever it is
[32:51] but the seals was open the mystery of it
[32:54] to call the eleven hour gentle workers
[32:57] that's you and i
[32:59] to receive something not to talk about
[33:01] it
[33:02] not to testify about it not to just
[33:04] preach about it
[33:05] and teach about it but to literally
[33:08] receive
[33:09] something and tonight if everything you
[33:12] get from this service tonight is that
[33:14] you have to receive
[33:15] something you have to receive something
[33:19] i'm not talking about coming to church
[33:20] i'm not talking about listening to tapes
[33:22] i'm not talking about reading books i'm
[33:24] talking about to receive
[33:26] something belly shall flow rivers of
[33:28] living water
[33:29] then we went on to explain that or
[33:31] interpret the dispatchy of the spirit
[33:34] that they should receive but jesus was
[33:36] not yet glorified
[33:38] so the holy ghost was not yet given so
[33:39] it was an uncommon promise
[33:41] but he was dropping the promises of them
[33:43] he that believe it on me as the
[33:45] scripture had said
[33:46] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[33:48] living water and that has an
[33:49] interpretation with that which is the
[33:51] holy ghost
[33:52] and the filling of the holy ghost so
[33:53] let's go again the 11th
[33:55] the seven angel memphis our workers got
[33:58] and jesus taught it he said there were
[34:00] some people who went into the harvest
[34:02] and they were hired so we know that
[34:04] jesus was hiding
[34:05] mysteries in parables that's how he was
[34:07] veiling it it looked like his stories
[34:09] and telling stories and parables but the
[34:12] reality was
[34:13] he was veiling mysteries inside of those
[34:16] parables
[34:17] so he said on the noon time someone went
[34:19] so he said and they went and um
[34:21] they were hired and when they did in the
[34:23] early morning they received time a penny
[34:25] for the day
[34:26] and at noon time someone else came in
[34:28] went to work 11th hour that's the last
[34:30] of the day
[34:31] that someone come in and receive the
[34:33] same kind of pay that they did at the
[34:34] first hour of the day
[34:35] it so perfectly was a dark age that
[34:37] blocked them out
[34:38] then in the middle of the day luther
[34:40] wesley came in
[34:42] and then there is to be here we go an
[34:45] evening time message and and to receive
[34:49] the same thing
[34:50] that it did at the beginning the evening
[34:53] time message
[34:54] was to restore back or to bring back
[34:57] that same thing again oh hallelujah
[35:02] the same thing that those brothers
[35:05] receive
[35:06] so he sent a prophet messenger to turn
[35:08] our hearts back
[35:09] to the fate of the fathers to get the
[35:11] same pay that all the guys
[35:13] had received isn't that wonderful oh
[35:15] glory to god the word is not by might
[35:18] not by power but by my spirit
[35:20] and these are the messages of grace he
[35:22] said who what thou great mountain
[35:24] before there's a rubber belt though
[35:25] shall become a plane he shall bring
[35:27] forth the headstone
[35:28] without shouting scrying people who had
[35:30] laid the foundation of the building
[35:32] and he said the ruby bell had laid the
[35:34] foundation with his hands he shall also
[35:36] bring forth the headstone
[35:37] i want you to notice he never said he
[35:40] shall bring forth the cornerstone
[35:42] he shall bring forth the headstone so he
[35:44] is speaking
[35:45] about our day our time this is not
[35:47] cornerstone time
[35:48] this is headstone time so jew hubba bell
[35:51] was prophesying about our day
[35:53] and we know the scriptures say that
[35:54] jesus is the chief cornerstone
[35:56] he's also the headstone now if he would
[35:59] think for a few minutes
[36:00] that the seventh church messenger was
[36:03] the restored
[36:04] fate of the children back to the fathers
[36:06] in other words
[36:07] so that statement could be taken this
[36:10] way and that way
[36:11] but when the prophet interpreted you
[36:13] have no more
[36:14] interpretation to go with it he said in
[36:16] other words rebuild the church again
[36:19] under the power of the spirit not my
[36:21] power
[36:22] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[36:25] lord
[36:25] not by organization not by the
[36:28] nomination
[36:28] but by the holy spirit god will bring
[36:31] for this church in the last day
[36:32] so no man can run that no man can
[36:35] overshadow that
[36:35] no man can denominate that it's by the
[36:38] holy ghost holy ghost alone
[36:40] that god going to bring forth the church
[36:42] in the last day oh glory to god and if i
[36:44] had to call it inspiration for this
[36:45] i would call it power from on high oh
[36:47] glory to god not poor from america
[36:50] power from from from south america or
[36:52] africa or europe power from on high
[36:54] oh glory to god this power for the bride
[36:57] is powering from a man

[37:04] performed the mrs association
[37:05] power from on high he said you shall
[37:07] receive power when after the holy ghost

[37:12] you follow this message pope
[37:13] no no after the holy ghost come upon you
[37:16] oh glory to god oh give the lord some
[37:19] praises tonight
[37:20] power from on high they say what is
[37:22] promise this is what we have to receive
[37:24] you don't don't short yourself oh glory
[37:27] to god don't short yourself hallelujah
[37:30] listen this is from the seat of god
[37:32] jesus said a man went out and he walked
[37:34] another man went out to another hour he
[37:36] worked another one went out and worked
[37:37] and one man went out at the 11th hour
[37:40] and then he stopped at the 11 hour he
[37:42] gave everyone the same portion
[37:44] the eleventh hour they wondered why he
[37:46] got eleven tower everyone coming in
[37:48] martin luther work and luther
[37:49] dispensation died in grace others
[37:51] shouted methodists
[37:52] on the westerly age died in grace we are
[37:54] living in another age
[37:56] not back there mother used to say we go
[37:58] on an ox cat
[37:59] now we got a model v8 ford almost jet
[38:01] propelled
[38:02] we are living in a different age
[38:04] altogether we are living in a different
[38:06] dispensation
[38:07] we are living in the day of the
[38:09] restoration of the powers of god
[38:12] and christ said would be powers yonder
[38:14] like they did in the beginning
[38:16] we are living another age they're not
[38:18] looting age there's no westerly age
[38:20] there's the hour of the restoration
[38:21] of the power of god all glory to god and
[38:24] brother branham was the first one
[38:25] that came to maturity to demonstrate
[38:28] this power of god
[38:29] and that sign that he was was saying
[38:32] other sons coming with the same power of
[38:34] god
[38:34] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[38:37] other sons come in
[38:38] with the same power of god don't look
[38:40] back yet to wesley methodist
[38:42] then finish already he's the ought and
[38:44] finisher of our faith
[38:46] oh glory to god the 11th hour people
[38:48] would come
[38:49] in the last calling of the gentiles
[38:53] mother worked there dad worked
[38:54] grandmother worked there this is our age
[38:57] the 11th hour was stopped on the 11th
[39:00] month in the year
[39:01] the 11th day of the month the 11 hour of
[39:03] the day the 11th minute and the hour
[39:05] and the 11th hour people might come in
[39:07] what to receive you know what
[39:09] the same baptism of the holy ghost that
[39:12] they big that back there
[39:13] what the same hallelujah baptism
[39:17] are saying it tonight the same one not
[39:20] the new one not a different one not a
[39:21] modern one
[39:22] the same holy ghost they received back
[39:24] there
[39:25] that they did at the beginning to bring
[39:27] back the powers
[39:29] and the resurrection of the lord jesus
[39:30] christ with the same signs
[39:33] and the same wonders oh blessed be the
[39:36] name of the lord
[39:37] hallelujah hallelujah but the message
[39:40] these sendings there's so much
[39:41] intellectualism all people weren't
[39:43] interested in is what this mean
[39:45] and what this mean could you explain to
[39:47] change anybody could you achieve the
[39:48] resurrection
[39:49] somebody won't hear about the trumpet
[39:50] god holy trump is unfolding and they
[39:52] trump a god and returning christ shall
[39:54] rise
[39:54] and what kind of body they come up with
[39:56] i'm not gonna explanation and what that
[39:57] we don't need that we need to believe
[39:59] what god promised not no explanation
[40:01] revelation we need no explanation we
[40:04] need revelation
[40:05] and expectation for the manifestation of
[40:08] what god promised
[40:09] or give the lord some praises because
[40:11] once it's revealed
[40:12] which is faith it puts you in a channel
[40:14] it puts you in an atmosphere
[40:16] of expectation for what god promised oh
[40:19] glory to god
[40:20] hallelujah thank you lord jesus
[40:24] hallelujah let me continue here now
[40:28] and this is some modern events there are
[40:29] many people just can't believe it
[40:31] it's even spiritual people i'm going to
[40:33] give you one that will choke you
[40:35] the baptism of the holy ghost don't mean
[40:38] you're going in
[40:39] not at all not on that don't have
[40:41] anything to do with your soul
[40:43] and that's the baptism here's the inside
[40:46] soul in here
[40:47] has got to come from god then on the
[40:49] outside you have five
[40:50] senses in let's see your ugly home the
[40:53] inside
[40:54] you have a spirit in there you have five
[40:56] outlets conscience
[40:57] imagination memory and so on like that
[40:59] remember in that spirit
[41:00] you can be baptized with the genuine
[41:02] spirit of god and still be lost it is
[41:04] the soul that lives
[41:05] that was ordained of god now you may be
[41:08] seated
[41:08] now this quote here uh ministers take
[41:12] this and mean there is no
[41:13] there is no need for the holy ghost
[41:15] because that you could have the holy
[41:16] ghost baptism
[41:17] and be lost but this is not what he's
[41:19] saying here that is not what he is
[41:21] seeing here
[41:21] that is interpreted like that that you
[41:24] don't need the holy ghost
[41:25] because the seed in his soul what he is
[41:27] saying are saved this way
[41:28] when the holy ghost fell on the
[41:30] lutherans they could only produce
[41:31] justification
[41:32] because that was their seed when the
[41:34] holy ghost fell on the wesleyans they
[41:36] could only produce sanctification
[41:38] because that was their seed hallelujah
[41:40] when the holy ghost fell on the
[41:42] pentecostals they produced the gifts
[41:43] because that was their seed
[41:45] now our seed is not abraham fate it's
[41:47] not is the isaac love it's not jacob
[41:49] grace it's to the perfection
[41:51] that's our seed so when the holy ghost
[41:53] fall on us we have to produce
[41:55] that rainbow coat or give the lord a
[41:57] shout in the house
[41:58] that is our seed if the seed is right
[42:01] then the holy ghost activate the sea
[42:03] that is right
[42:04] and that seed in you is in your soul all
[42:07] glory to god the holy ghost doesn't make
[42:09] you a son
[42:10] because your son god empowers you but
[42:13] the holy ghost
[42:14] you shall receive power when the holy
[42:16] ghost come upon you
[42:17] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[42:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:21] so this quote i just read does not
[42:24] negate
[42:25] the experience of the holy ghost and
[42:28] this is what he said what is the holy
[42:30] ghost what is it
[42:31] now the reason i have taken this subject
[42:33] you cannot come and receive the holy
[42:34] spirit
[42:35] unless you know what it is you cannot
[42:37] receive it if you know what it is unless
[42:38] you
[42:39] believe it's given to you and it's for
[42:41] you and you cannot know
[42:43] whether you've got it or not unless you
[42:45] know the results it brings
[42:47] so if you know what it is who it's to
[42:51] what accident brings when it comes then
[42:54] you will know what you got when you get
[42:55] it
[42:56] and that would settle it now the first
[42:58] place
[42:59] the holy spirit has been promised no no
[43:01] man promised that the court promised
[43:03] that
[43:04] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the
[43:06] holy ghost is what
[43:08] a promise that's what is a promise
[43:10] hallelujah
[43:11] the holy spirit is a sign and abram our
[43:14] father was given a promise
[43:15] because god gave the promise to abraham
[43:17] unto his seed and the promise was made
[43:19] to abraham and to receive and this sign
[43:22] is the covenant people then he went on
[43:24] to say this there's a vast difference
[43:26] between just a christian and a holy
[43:29] ghost-filled christian
[43:31] this has nothing to do with i am in the
[43:33] message
[43:34] i believe a prophet this is not what we
[43:36] speak in here
[43:37] there's a vast difference between just a
[43:39] christian
[43:40] and a holy ghost-filled christian are we
[43:43] going to get this from the scripture
[43:45] place it exactly in the scripture the
[43:47] first place
[43:48] there's a christian that professed to be
[43:50] a christian
[43:51] hallelujah and if this christian has not
[43:54] yet been
[43:54] filled with the holy ghost he is only in
[43:58] the process
[43:59] of being a christian he is a professed
[44:01] to believe it
[44:02] he is working to it but god has not
[44:04] given him his spirit of the holy ghost
[44:07] he has not yet reached that goal with
[44:08] god that god recognized it
[44:11] and the circumcision is the type of the
[44:12] holy ghost and god gave abraham
[44:14] the circumcision after he had accepted
[44:17] god
[44:17] on his promise and walk out into a
[44:19] strange country it was a sign
[44:21] and all his children and their seed
[44:23] after him should have this sign in their
[44:25] flesh
[44:26] because it was a distinction it was to
[44:28] separate them from all other people
[44:30] this sign of circumcision and that's
[44:33] what god uses today
[44:34] is a sign of circumcision of the heart
[44:36] the holy spirit
[44:38] and that makes god's church a separated
[44:40] church
[44:41] so oh hallelujah so it's a promise it's
[44:44] a sign
[44:45] it's a seal it's a seal of a finished
[44:47] work
[44:48] it's your witness it's your seal it's
[44:50] your assurance
[44:51] it's your protection is to say i'm
[44:53] heaven bong don't care what the devil
[44:55] say i'm heaven bong
[44:57] he sealed me he gave it to me he see me
[45:00] in his kingdom
[45:01] i am glory bomb if you seal you no
[45:04] minister could unseal you
[45:05] they could trail the church by the
[45:07] country of the kingdom they control
[45:09] the circle but they captured all the
[45:11] kingdom or give the lord a shout
[45:13] what is the holy ghost it is the spirit
[45:16] of christ
[45:17] in you so the holy ghost another
[45:19] trinidadian the holy ghost is not a
[45:21] trait in that spirit do you want us
[45:22] prayer they'll get
[45:23] busted and rip out hallelujah yeah china
[45:26] thing
[45:26] with the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[45:28] christ spirit
[45:30] oh glory to god give your word a new
[45:32] heart a new spirit
[45:33] and my spirit that holy ghost is my
[45:36] spirit
[45:37] his spirit holy spirit oh glory i will
[45:40] not leave you
[45:40] comfortless i will come to you little
[45:43] while the worst hit me no more but you
[45:44] are going to see me oh give the lord
[45:46] some praises hallelujah
[45:48] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[45:51] to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah
[45:54] blessed be the name of the lord oh
[45:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[45:58] praise god let's continue the holy
[46:00] spirit given utterance sometimes
[46:02] with words you can't understand he's our
[46:05] attorney
[46:06] he pleads for us isn't that right he
[46:08] stands in our place what is the holy
[46:09] ghost the rest
[46:11] amen let's notice again it's a promise
[46:13] to the believer
[46:14] and then he quote this scripture he said
[46:16] uh um
[46:17] i send my promise to my father upon you
[46:19] what promise the one isaiah
[46:21] spoke about with stamina lips another
[46:23] tongues
[46:24] so when jesus opened it on the sign to
[46:25] the scriptures not only did he open
[46:27] understanding to the old settlement text
[46:30] of what was hidden back there but he
[46:32] unfolded to them
[46:34] what they had was to receive just as the
[46:36] prophet came to
[46:37] to tie up the loose ends and talk about
[46:39] soup and seed and all kind of hidden
[46:40] mysteries that was back there that
[46:42] couldn't be understood
[46:43] but not only that he tell them what they
[46:45] have to receive
[46:46] and then he said but i'll send the
[46:48] promise of my father
[46:49] upon you but tarry in the city of
[46:51] jerusalem
[46:52] until you be endured with power from on
[46:56] high
[46:56] and there's going to be a church there's
[46:58] going to be a bunch of people
[46:59] that will be endued with power from on
[47:02] high let me say it real good
[47:03] there's going to be a people in trinidad
[47:05] that's going to be endued
[47:06] with power from on high not power from
[47:09] no bishop

[47:12] from on high

[47:15] your power after the holy ghost come

[47:22] that wouldn't make it rock that the
[47:23] peters has the bishop can't stay upright
[47:26] or glory to god he might even throw them
[47:27] on the floor it doesn't matter what to
[47:29] do yo
[47:30] doesn't matter what happened to you oh
[47:32] glory to god what is the holy ghost then
[47:35] he said powerful and high not from a
[47:37] bishop not power from the church
[47:39] but power from on high he said you
[47:41] become a member of the brahm tabernacle
[47:43] he said no
[47:44] you become a member to this church no
[47:46] not so you don't see power
[47:48] after you become a preacher no you shall
[47:50] receive power

[47:52] not power after they've gone preacher i
[47:54] have been calling pulp but i think i'm a
[47:55] singer i'm a musician i held that dick

[50:57] thing they don't you let
[50:58] nothing put anything in your heart less
[51:00] than that oh glory to god
[51:03] oh my hallelujah let's take a little
[51:06] more
[51:07] remember the old testament if a man lost
[51:09] his inheritance a squatter come on islam
[51:12] he could not hold it any longer until 50
[51:15] years
[51:16] after 50 years the year of jubilee came
[51:19] by

[51:21] jubilee come along then everything went
[51:22] back to the original at the beginning
[51:24] this is god law god put it in a way so
[51:27] people are scrunting and suffering your
[51:28] your family own a lot of money and they
[51:30] take you into captivity they could only
[51:32] hold it for 50 years
[51:33] after 50 years jubilee trumpet song you
[51:35] have to go free you have no choice
[51:37] so either if you acquire any money you
[51:39] could pay back for your property
[51:41] get back your land get back inheritance
[51:43] but in case you have no money
[51:44] that's where the grace comes in when you
[51:46] have no money you can't afford to
[51:48] deliver yourself you can't afford to
[51:50] free yourself
[51:50] the grace come to you oh god you didn't
[51:53] ask for it you didn't
[51:54] pay for it you didn't praise it you

[51:59] to give you a jubilee a release a
[52:01] release from your sickness or release
[52:03] from your bondage of release from your
[52:05] hard

[52:08] the wet on your cheeks of your tears
[52:10] that you cry any night
[52:11] oh hallelujah praise god thank you lord
[52:14] so after 50 years a year jubilee came
[52:17] and the year of jubilee when that year
[52:18] jubilee come along
[52:19] then everything went back to the
[52:21] original at the beginning all
[52:22] slaves they went back to the original
[52:24] beginning if a man was holding a field
[52:26] and the trumpet sounded unheard it he
[52:28] throw down the hole and say i am no more
[52:30] a slave
[52:31] i want to go back to my family
[52:33] hallelujah he had the right
[52:35] he had the legal right he could tell the
[52:37] owner you can't hold me back
[52:39] because he had trumpet and every word
[52:41] tonight is a trumpet
[52:42] a trumpeter being strongly tonight oh
[52:45] glory to god
[52:46] hallelujah praise god on one of these
[52:48] days
[52:49] the world will fall and the legal owners
[52:52] will come
[52:52] one of these days the meek shall inherit
[52:55] the earth one of these days
[52:56] we will take back everything that the
[52:59] devil took from you
[53:00] you're gonna take it back oh glory to
[53:02] god hallelujah
[53:03] glory to god the other debate he says
[53:06] hallelujah disciples say they stole him
[53:09] by night that a debate they argue and
[53:11] devils saying they're saying that but on
[53:12] the 50th day
[53:14] was the day of pentecost and the legal
[53:16] owner came down among them
[53:17] and showed it was no organization
[53:20] hallelujah
[53:22] listen to this bomb the legal owner
[53:25] came down among them and showed it was
[53:29] no organization
[53:30] that it was a filling of the holy ghost
[53:33] that was god's earnest money to his
[53:36] church
[53:37] that it would not be controlled
[53:40] by organization and so forth but it
[53:43] would be the illness
[53:44] of the baptism of the holy ghost with
[53:46] the power and the love of god
[53:48] and that is why i reject number six i
[53:51] reject any man that's trying to take
[53:53] authority over the severity of the local
[53:55] church i reject it i will
[53:57] bless it or uncompromising with it
[54:00] for glory to god because the church the
[54:02] local church supposed to ask
[54:04] have access to the holy ghost to get
[54:06] instruction and guidance
[54:08] not some man from somewhere giving
[54:10] instructions as what the locals are
[54:11] supposed to do
[54:12] away with that oh glory to god is not
[54:15] god's plan at all
[54:16] they don't have that holy ghost led
[54:18] philip holy ghost directed paul
[54:21] the holy ghost sent peter was no man

[54:50] mother and struck the children

[55:14] after 50 days he said god sent the holy
[55:17] ghost back
[55:18] to run the squatters out and to take
[55:21] over
[55:22] the power of the holy ghost came down
[55:24] and the church received
[55:26] its earnest of salvation not brethren
[55:27] not to hurt your feelings
[55:29] or anything about it if the organization
[55:31] is right
[55:32] and you're just a catholic my
[55:33] organization your baptist my
[55:35] organization
[55:36] or your new message because you're a
[55:38] message by organization and you're
[55:40] like a person in your church he says
[55:42] watch
[55:43] he says joining church he says the
[55:45] illness of your salvation
[55:47] he said if you are by baptization you
[55:49] are lost
[55:51] the earnest or your salvation was not
[55:54] joining the church
[55:55] the earnest of your salvation was not
[55:57] belonging to some organization
[55:59] the illness of your salvation is the
[56:01] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:03] without any organization
[56:06] so you can't tie the baptism into a
[56:08] group to a church
[56:09] the baptism is from god and god is
[56:12] suffering he give the holy ghost to them
[56:14] who obey him
[56:15] oh glory to god to show you the
[56:16] sovereignty of god god sent peter to
[56:18] cornelius house you know the story
[56:20] congress was what he was a gentile he
[56:22] wasn't a jew
[56:23] is the first time peter had interaction
[56:25] with the gentiles given testimony what
[56:27] kind of man was that he was just
[56:28] he was devout he was a giving man a
[56:31] sharing man the man had a good heart
[56:32] god oh watch because you're gentile he
[56:34] watch what kind of heart in that man
[56:36] that's what he sent to get that man
[56:37] that's why he's sending peter from that
[56:39] man
[56:39] because peter was activated and he was
[56:41] part of the body
[56:42] and life had to come to the body after
[56:44] the holy ghost come after dynamic strike
[56:46] you're only getting light through the
[56:47] body and peter was part of that body so
[56:49] god had to minister life
[56:51] out to peter's mouth oh glory to god
[56:53] because peter becomes quite channel
[56:55] of communication for life to go forth so
[56:58] why peter was preaching the word
[56:59] holy ghost fell upon them that heard the
[57:01] word cornelius was filled with the holy
[57:03] ghost
[57:03] and he said what this what is this that

[57:14] glory to god
[57:15] by one spirit we are baptized you are
[57:18] gentile
[57:18] or give the lord a shout by one spirit
[57:21] we are all made to drink of that one
[57:23] spirit
[57:24] oh glory to god true or gentile
[57:27] oh glory to god amen the earnest
[57:30] of our salvation is the baptism of the
[57:32] holy ghost
[57:33] without annualization amen they could
[57:35] not hold it back
[57:36] 50 day he said the day of jubilee then
[57:39] it went back to the original
[57:41] and the power of god was taken back to
[57:42] his origin of the 50th day
[57:44] and yeah yeah the prophecy there will
[57:47] come
[57:48] another year of jubilee oh glory to god
[57:51] a prophecy what that is
[57:52] that is grace for the all you ever were
[57:55] gentle workers
[57:57] you know why we walk in the judgment
[57:59] this world under judgment right now all
[58:01] this chronic
[58:02] judgment judgment all over but i miss
[58:05] all of that
[58:06] there's a prophecy hanging tonight of
[58:09] grace
[58:09] coming by the jubilee trumpet being
[58:12] sounded
[58:13] for the living our gentile workers i
[58:15] thank god tonight
[58:17] for the trumpet of the jubilee o give
[58:19] the lord a shout
[58:21] hallelujah he said there will come
[58:23] another year of jubilee
[58:25] we have had it just about this time you
[58:26] know this pentecost failed in america
[58:28] for about 50 years i said more she's
[58:30] dependent began to fail
[58:32] now what happened in the church is
[58:33] receiving the seventh year book of the
[58:34] revelation of jesus christ and not one
[58:36] tenth of them
[58:37] could receive it and then he explains
[58:40] what that jubilee will look like he said
[58:42] when you begin to see
[58:44] the year of jubilee where we don't have
[58:47] to fuss
[58:49] and stream and pull like this
[58:52] we already secured in christ oh
[58:55] hallelujah
[58:56] that's a type of the year of jubilee no
[58:58] straining
[58:59] no pulling that's the flow of the spirit
[59:03] there is
[59:04] my spirit flowing freely oh glory to
[59:08] god hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah
[59:12] thank you lord jesus no i'll harvest
[59:15] time to see this back to the original
[59:16] condition
[59:17] and must have all the word in order to
[59:19] be seed it's not right
[59:20] you can't have half a seed it won't grow
[59:22] you can't say i believe in the baptism
[59:24] holy ghost
[59:25] hallelujah i believe in speaking in
[59:26] tongues that's part of the seed
[59:28] but now they have to be added to that
[59:30] the life so to the baptism have to add
[59:33] seven steps
[59:34] which is the life which is virtual
[59:36] knowledge and temperance and patience
[59:37] and godliness
[59:38] to the baptism have to be added the life
[59:40] which is them seven steps
[59:42] then the person of christ come on top of
[59:44] that because you know become a templar
[59:45] house
[59:46] oh glory to god that he could step into
[59:49] oh hallelujah praise god a reproduction
[59:52] of the original grain the life that was
[59:54] in the husk
[59:55] in the stalk in the tassel all gathers
[59:58] up in the seed
[59:59] and the life that was in the stock when
[1:00:02] one went to make the other and then he
[1:00:04] said justification made our way for
[1:00:06] signification
[1:00:06] so you can't kick our justification you
[1:00:08] know you justified because you need a
[1:00:09] message significant momentum make a way
[1:00:11] for the
[1:00:12] for holy ghost and he said and the
[1:00:14] baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:00:16] for the holy ghost itself
[1:00:23] that's my body but holy ghost people
[1:00:24] don't kind of crazy stuff because that's
[1:00:26] not the holy ghost itself
[1:00:28] but abram had the holy ghost itself
[1:00:30] which is the person of christ
[1:00:32] veiled that's different hallelujah
[1:00:34] that's not the birth baptism that's the
[1:00:36] life added
[1:00:37] oh glory to god so he said watch
[1:00:39] justification
[1:00:40] wait for the simplification
[1:00:41] certification made away for the batman
[1:00:43] legos
[1:00:43] and the baptism hollywood was made a way
[1:00:45] for the holy ghost itself
