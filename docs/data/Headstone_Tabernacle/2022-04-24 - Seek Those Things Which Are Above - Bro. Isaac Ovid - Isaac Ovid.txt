failures when you look at us you see us through the blood father and we are redeemed by that blood we are redeemed by our testimony we are redeemed by power father we dedicate this service to you this morning may you take complete control may you break chains and shackles may you send healing to your people may you send breakthrough to your people may you touch your people one more time lord there are so many needs in the church of father people battling depression battling anxiety battling sickness and battling all kinds of things but father your promise that you you are a better friend than i could ever be you promised to never leave us your promise and never forsake us so father me you moved through the camp this morning move in the sanctuary move downstairs move into homes move into lives and move into wherever your people are this morning as they hear your word granted now we asking the precious theme of jesus christ amen and amen can we give the lord another hand of praise i wanna i'd like to deal with the prayer requests and the praises before getting into the service so i know the praise from sister trisha gomez i'm happy this morning to be in the house of the lord once again giving god praise for keeping me alive because of a near fatal accident that almost occurred on my way here this morning so she is thanking god [Applause] amen and uh brother also sends his gratitude for the praise of the saints he's doing a lot better and he's thanking god for that so do continue to blame in prayer but he is doing much much better by the grace of god so also we want to remember in prayer another prayer request for sis from sister vivian i'm requesting prayer for teddy kwame for an operation that he has to take on wednesday for prostate cancer and for the salvation of his soul also from barry o'brien for his grandson elijah holder he's having trouble breathing and we also want to remember brother anthony o'brien and his family in prayer not feeling well so let's just bow our heads and if there's anybody who wants to show a raise of hands maybe you have a need for you maybe it's a need for a family member a loved one you didn't get to put in it uh put it in via prayer request but you have a burden in your heart this morning shall we approach the throne of grace one more time our gracious heavenly father lord we have stood behind this sacred desk and saw it seen so many prayer requests become notes or praises lord as your will and your power and your grace and your love is unfolded to your children as your taught us healing as a children's bread and father we come lord father get a piece of that bread this morning lord we come this morning to taste and see that the lord is good father we come this morning with needs in our hearts for situations that have been written and expressed and those that have not been written and have not been expressed but lord you know every knee this morning father we want to bring brother barry's grandson elijah holder before your throne of grace right now lord that the angel of the lord would step into that room right now where he is and touch him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet may he have immediate relief in the name of jesus christ father lord we pray for teddy kwame father lord that the angel of the lord will visit him right now lord and before the doctors could even operate their healing would already begin to move through his body lord with this prostate cancer situation and may he experience lord not just a miracle of healing but the greatest miracle for his heart to be turned back to you father god may you touch him now in the name of jesus christ lord for your son the lord your servant your minister brother anthony o'brien his wife and his children lord they are all not feeling well but many angels of the lord pass by that street right now open the gate open the door open the house and walk into each of them in the name of jesus christ may the angel move through that house and heal each one in the mighty name of jesus christ lord and for our precious pastor who's at home resting lord you've already touched him but lord we pray for lord of speedy and complete healing and touching his body from the crown of his head to the sword of his feet may you touch us to ann marie may you anoint our pastor in the name of jesus christ and lord every request that was expressed or not expressed father for your people in different situations there are so many conditions lord that i pray there god that he would minister to each one in the mighty precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen amen you love the lord this morning amen so if you have your bibles would you turn with me to one portion of scripture i'd like to read from the book of colossians chapter three certainly welcome one and all in the precious name of jesus christ those that are here those that are connected online as well uh let's have church amen certainly appreciate the convention uh last weekend how many were blessed by the convention last weekend certainly thank god for his unfolding of his grace and his love to us as we near our departure from this this existence to what we are really called to do so we're going to read three verses there in colossians uh colossians three reading from verse one if ye then be risen with christ so this this scripture here is not addressed to everyone it's only expressed or addressed to this specific designation if ye be then risen with christ it means there are those who are not risen with christ but if it's a conditionality it's conditional if ye then be risen with christ then i have an expectation or a commando and instruction seek those things which are above where christ sit on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning and i have a title this morning seek those things which are above seek those things which are above and it's a simple message i'll have a little almost a little bible teaching insider here as well because i believe this colossians 3 is a really powerful scripture to look at because so many times and we have to embrace the truth of the fact that we are constantly in a battle and we cannot take for granted if it's one thing that you see through the word you cannot take for granted your past experience with god as your present battle you can use your past experience to build your fate but it doesn't mean you won't have a new battle this morning a new battle tomorrow a new battle on wednesday a new battle on friday a new challenge and a new situation and all of the things that happen to us i believe are for distractions to keep our eyes away from what's most important and it's so easy to lose sight of what's most important so we want to reinforce this morning to seek those things which are above and to set our affection on things that are above not on things on the earth now bearing in mind paul is speaking to those who are risen with christ so he's also reminding them that it's easy for your affection to get set on the things on the earth but he's encouraging them here in this scripture to set and that set is a decision to make it's a choice to make it's a consciousness that you are making you're making it in the morning you're making it at lunch time you're making it in your home you're making it at a church you're making it when you feel the fly off the handle you're still remembering there's something higher that's going on right now i'm in a situation at the bank but there's something more important that's going on right now there's a situation in my family but there's something more important that's going on right now whenever you you get distracted and you and you fly off your handle and you you lose your temper and you get all upset and you have oughts and grudges and these things that will get it in the scripture it meant you have taken your eyes off of what's above and you are now focusing on what's lower than what's above but we are not called to operate in this existence we are not called to operate on our level we are being challenged to go a little higher so by the grace of god this morning we want to go a little higher because when you go higher all of your perspectives begin to change once you could break past the sound barrier and come out of this existence your worship changes your understanding changes your revelation changes your focus changes your desires changing what's your desire this morning what are you here for this morning what's your desire this week what's your focus this week how did you find yourself lost along the way somewhere you need to check what you are looking at because what you look at is what you're going to see hallelujah when you look what you're going to see this morning it depends on what you're looking for if you come here looking for mistakes you're going to find mistakes if you're looking for falls in yourself you're gonna find fault in yourself up you're gonna find fault in your brother you can spend all day looking at somebody else up but if you change your focus from the falls and the mistakes and the issues and the problems and all of these other things and focus on above then everything else begins to disappear hallelujah hallelujah seek those things up i'm not saying don't go after a house i'm not saying don't go after a car i'm not saying don't go after a better job but make sure in all you're getting you don't lose sight to seek those things which are above oh too many of us spend our daily living seeking to sort out the natural things and not enough focus is spent on seeking the things that are above oh hallelujah it is not something impossible to attain but it requires focus it requires dedication it requires commitment that's why paul could say to the church if you are risen with christ if you are identified with his resurrection if you are identified with why he came if you are identified with the fact that he died and he rose again and you know that you died with him and you are identified with calvary and you identify with when he was buried and you identified with when he rose from the dead now your work begins to seek to ask to knock to press to do something to cut things off to add certain things to adjust your position to change your attitude to change your focus oh hallelujah it takes effort to smile when you should be upset but that's part of seeking the things that are above us because on that side when things are above there is no sadness there there's no depression there yes you have to deal with the flesh but the bible says mortify that flesh mortify your feelings this morning mortify your body bring your body under subjection bring your emotions on the bring your feelings on the subjection bring your attitude on the subjection oh hallelujah hallelujah you have to forgive me this morning but i'm tired of living lower than my station i'm tired of living under my privilege that's what brother branham said the church of the body of christ is one of the sickest bodies on the face of the earth because we are living under our god-given privileges we should be living higher we should be flying higher we should be in a different realm we should be in a higher place oh hallelujah no wonder god could tell john come up hither come up higher he was in the spirit and god said there's still more they're still higher they're still higher whatever is the greatest experience you have ever had in the supernatural there's still more because it's an infinite god oh hallelujah you cannot figure him out up you he is distorted higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than always he said as the heaven is higher than the earth so am i taught above your thoughts but only those things which are revealed unto us they belong to us they are things that god has not unfolded to you yet but the mysteries of what we need to be changed that's revealed to us what are we doing about it what are we doing with it i'm tired of living is anybody this morning tired of living up and down tired of living under your privilege tired of not knowing where you're going and you have a revelation you know but there's something pulling you back and it's a constant battle and it's supposed to be a battle but you have to know that one day you're gonna break past this sound barrier it's a level of resistance hallelujah when a plane is trying to take off it has some trembling going on has some tremors going on it has some shaking going on until it break pass up so if you're strumbling this morning if there are tremors in your life if things are being shaken don't stop keep climbing higher come up hither this morning come up hither in your home come up here in your church come up hither fly higher on your job come on come on you eagles fly above your coworkers fly above your family you don't belong you're not a chicken you're not in a chicken in the pan yeah fly above your family if they don't want to go you fly higher [Applause] fly higher fly above your bills yes fly above your sickness hallelujah because the higher you go the sickness can't follow you oh come on somebody help me oh come on fly above fly above your sin fly above doubt fly above fear [Applause] somebody help me this morning do you realize that not all birds can go to certain altitudes not all planes could go to certain altitudes the higher you go certain things that weigh you down can't follow you oh you don't hear me this morning anybody wants to go higher this morning the higher you go the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life you can take it with you when you want to go higher the higher you go this whole body start to want to change hallelujah and because it's a seed in you that is able to be changed or anything now when you go higher this body wants to put on immortality or you make me feel like preaching this morning higher than depression higher than frustration higher than animosity higher than malice higher than lust higher than pornography higher than that girl on the job higher than that boy on the top higher than that co-worker higher than the argument higher than the government higher than the gas price up higher than the economy higher than the world system higher than sports higher than the gym higher than everything else you are born to fly oh hallelujah how else you gonna make the rapture you are higher than that sin that's trying to hold you down you come from a higher place that sin cannot go up there climb higher this morning you may be seated no wonder brother branham said how could you have faith for the rapture if you barely have fit for divine healing you need to start a practice flying higher you need to let certain things go that normally where you town do you know how much work it is to hold a grudge you know how much work it is to lie and to remember your life you know how much work it takes to stay angry at somebody you know how much work it is just to worry about your bills it takes effort to worry but if you put down the worry the bible said cast your cares upon him oh hallelujah seek ye first the kingdom of god i told you i don't have a complex message but i'm tired of seeing people who know the word and they know the message weighed down with situations don't you have faith that god could provide for you don't you have faith david said i'm young once i was young and i'm not all but i've never seen the righteous forsaken don't you have faith in this god that you serve that you fly higher he could take care of your situations that you could never figure out don't wait until didn't get bad no fly up this morning mama eagle the holy ghost itself that mother eagle is hovering over the church this morning looking to catch anybody who is willing to break past their self-imposed limitations break past the limitations of their past break past the limitations of yes i don't care about yesterday i'm talking about no no faith is this is the beginning of the rest of your life i don't care about yesterday i don't care about last month i don't care about last week [Music] this here right now is all i know there's nothing you could do to change your past you cannot change it there's nothing you could do there is nothing you could do to change your passive you only have power today today today to worship power today to praise god power today to flap those wings and care how long you've been in the barnyard i don't care how long you thought you was a chicken i don't care how long you've eaten chicken food and played in chicken places [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated when you go for a job what a job ask you for is your resume your job wants to know your history your job wants to know your background your job wants to know your experience to be employed by god he don't care about your resume he don't want to know where you come from he don't want to know your experience he don't want to know your qualifications to be employed to be part of this body of christ it has all to do with your destination not where you come from it has to do with where you're going do you know where you're going because my bible tells me we are called for something higher and because you're plain your body your heart your soul could go to higher altitudes that's why god called you you could rise above your situation you could rise above it hallelujah no wonder the brother branham said when you lift your hands you defy the laws of gravity it might be simple but just that act alone just that act alone is an act of faith and that's why i always say you may be seated we bring a sacrifice of praise it's a sacrifice because it costs something because there are times in your life you don't feel like it read the psalms david and many times he didn't feel like it there are many times david felt depressed and frustrated but somehow when you read it he'll find a way to work himself back into something many are there that rise up against me that's the part when he's he's looking at himself and looking many a day that say of my soul there's no help for him in god that that's what he's seeing but then another gear throws in and he remembers that he is born to fly and he said but thou o lord are a shield for me [Music] can you throw in another gear in your spiritual walk can you throw in another gear despite what's happening with your family can you throw in another gear despite what you're dealing with in your home yes i know they are home issues yes i know there are challenges but that's how god allowed it to be for your maturity for your perfection to force you to fly because if you if you get too comfortable you'll stay in the barnyard so god is coming this morning to shake up your barnyard for you to recognize you're not a chicken but you're an eagle and you're born to fly to receive the holy ghost to have your personal revival to have a new walk to have a new ho oh come on now [Applause] so i thank god for the situations i thank god for the child i thank god for the interruptions and the disruptions that's god's way of starting a revival in your soul it has nothing to do with anybody else i don't know what's going to happen this morning but i want somebody to break free to break loose to break out to break from to break towards hallelujah it's a great escape hallelujah if the devil can keep you in a barnyard he would if the devil can keep you tied up he would if he could keep him in bondage he would but you have the power this morning come on johnny crow let's fly [Applause] let's fly let's fly higher hallelujah i was looking at the study two studies i saw say if you take a baby elephant by the cliff and you tie that baby elephant to a pole and they do it for circus training that baby elephant when they tie him to the pole he learns to walk around the pole and he's tied to the pole they say no matter how much he grows and he gets bigger even when you cut the rope and you put him back near the pole he start to circle it again because he's been conditioned in his mind that that pole and that string even though he has the strength but a punch to break out he doesn't break out what's holding him back it's not the rope he's bigger he's stronger with one move he could rip out the rope but he believes that that rope that held him as a young baby is just as powerful as when he was young and he couldn't do it he didn't even realize he was growing he didn't realize the relationship between his growth and his ability to break free and you have to realize that as you grow in the world even though you're struggling with certain things don't underestimate the value of what every service does to you don't underestimate the value of what each word does to you because you are stronger and that's why the devil's job is to try to really mess up your mind and to reconnect your mind to your pastor your mistakes your failures but if you can just realize this morning that you are out listen you older and the devil you now i've preached it before you have seniority you know before the angels were created you when god oh do you know who you are and you had a representation when lucifer was kicked out [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah so catch a revelation this morning of who you are seek those things which are above how many people have lost themselves seeking the natural things and no matter how much money you have how much wealth you have how much of whatever you have there comes a point when it matters not listen to anybody who's on a deathbed anybody who is who is transitioning anybody and and they will tell you what they wish they had more of and what they would have done differently and it has nothing to do with the acquisition of more things that are of these nothing to do with it don't let the devil fool you with what's important don't let the devil take up your time over the last few days i was doing some research and i saw somebody speaking about how old and i mentioned how all the technology is rewiring our brains and there's a chemical part of it that the body of brain releases dopamine every time there's a short-term pleasure so you see a short-term video or whatever it is and every time it keeps you in this cycle of new things so that you're never bored and you always and people and young people in particular spending hours and hours and hours on social media and they're chasing this high this elusive high it's like taking a drug you know and people are addicted to technology addicted to all kinds of things and and it's becoming more difficult to focus to meditate to really understand and and it sounds simple but the reality is it affects your work because when you when it's time to pray your car pray you can't spend a half an hour an hour two hours or three hours in prayer no you can you spend 30 seconds because your brain has been trained to do things in 30 seconds sprints when the world says meditate on the word day and night let this be your source it doesn't say when you have a chance you know it's it doesn't it said seek those things seek is a active word it means you get up in the morning and you're seeking it means you're doing your job but you know you're seeking you're you're on this constant mission that doesn't ever turn off you're doing your job you're doing your work you're talking to family but in your heart you want to make sure that you're keeping your focus on the things that are above and that consciousness makes you adjust what words you use that consciousness makes you adjust who you spend time with that consciousness because you cannot be seeking the things that are above and watching movies that are taking you to hell anybody with me this morning don't tell me you're seeking the things that are above and you're spending time listening to music that is not going to take you above don't lie to yourself don't lie to god if you're really serious about seeking those things are above then the bible for you becomes a new book it doesn't become something you refer to in a service it becomes something you realize is the road map to get out of here [Applause] is not a ritual it is not a suggestion it's not a recommendation but it's a part of your life you don't know how you're going to live without it all of a sudden the spoken word books take on a new meaning because it's the currency to take you out of here hallelujah god help us this morning i don't know who is going to help but i want us to be reminded and to leave here with the whole focus it adjusts your prayer life is it just your approach how much time you lose yourself when you fly out of your hand when you get upset and then you end up in situations that you wish you didn't end up in and if you're really honest with yourself and look back at how i got there you'll realize you know if i was conscious of god's presence and my desire to be with him i wouldn't have said those words or wouldn't have said it that way or wouldn't have spoken about that person in that way or would it have acted that way or wouldn't have done that thing we have said it we can't change the past so it doesn't make sense going there but from this day forward i challenge you i encourage you let's press higher let's climb higher let's walk different oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah as we move towards a transformation because this whole scripture seeking things are above for a year dead and your life is hit with god in christ with with with christ in god is a transformation a transformation of your mind your heart your desires your everything until people know you're a christian you don't even need to tell them because your life has said you are dead all of a sudden we're about with now that's the same brother who used to be that way but how are you you're really different and it's not a show it's not an act it's very difficult to act for a long time you know but it's so real you can't help yourself i preached this in a message for the convention your hand that didn't want to shake somebody's hand all of a sudden you find yourself shaking their hand because it's a different life working through you is it from behavior looking to you because you have climbed so much higher that all are your petty feelings about brothers so-and-so or sister so and so can it's not compatible with that level of altitude once you go that higher level those petty things don't matter anymore all you know is love because only perfect love could oh come on now all you know is love it is simple principles friends it was the love of god for god so loved the world that love that existed and that level was so great you know you better than i know you i know me better than you know me and god's love looked at all of us and say that one i want that one that one i want that one that one i won that one and we find ourselves on them looking at this one that one this one that one and their situation not realizing that the same love that is for them is what came to us found us met us overlooked our fault overlooked our situations and that's why i have hope for everybody here this morning i have faith for everybody here this morning i believe for every single one here this morning that you could get the holy ghost you could be changed you could be transformed oh hallelujah somebody give the lord a shout out praise everybody feeling fine [Applause] [Music] seek those things which are above you need to take control of your time church you need to take control of your time everybody here have the same 24 hours in a everybody in the world have you seen 24 hours every day i was in the barber shop yesterday and somebody was talking about is struggling with something some business idea or something and it just came back to my mind and say i'm listening to them struggling just listening just over here in the conversation and i'm saying the same time they have it's the same time during the day that businessmen who are 5 10 20 five business self so the time is not the issue you know it's how you use the time i heard somebody say some time ago people complain about this complaint about this and he was speaking about somebody who reached out to him and he said complain how his business did well he asked him what are you doing right now he said well it's sunday evening i'm relaxing i'm watching some netflix he said you ready not worried about your business because if you're really worried about your business you wouldn't be spending time on us you you actually have time to relax because if it was really an issue then you would take it off and you would get down on your pen and your paper and write what are the problems what ideas do i have what can i implement what are the priorities what is it and that activity might take you 15 minutes 20 minutes or what to do but you would be further down the road to progress than spending two three hours on netflix saying well you're so stressed out you need a break i'm not saying you don't have time to rest and take a break and and the prophet you went went to the forest or relaxing but there are certain things that you must do but that comes to you making a choice because this scripture is active seek those things and then verse two set your affection set is like you go to the microwave and you set it nobody can do it for you you know you have to program your affection set your affection on things above not on things on the earth how have you programmed yourself this is not god doing it for you can we talk about this this is not god coming and and force you to behave a certain way or force you to forgive or force you to pray where have you programmed and set your affection because wherever you set your affection or where your heart is that's who you are but that's something you need to set your father can't set it your mother can't set it your brother can't set it and as it is is in the spiritual isn't it in the natural so your parents had to beat you to study for school young brother young sister go and study now go on sarina so you don't want to study you don't want to succeed you don't want to be able to provide when a bible say a man who can't provide me families worse than an infidel i scripture too so it's not even to please your parents you know that's scripture so if there are certain steps to take how are you programming yourself why are you programming yourself for entertainment [Music] and entertainment in in in its broadest sense simply means spending time doing unimportant things for pleasure you're finding time because you see listen it's easier for some of us to relax and to confront issues to fix you're complaining well i don't have enough point to do this i don't mean you know i'm going to do that have you set a budget have you looked at the expenses do you have a plan for the month oh you're just taking there and go on and you take a complaining never have sold anything yet uh i could show you for every person who has a complaint there's somebody else with the exact same situation who has a different mindset a different approach a different attitude and living life differently and most of them not even in church but what are they they are prepared to confront the reality of their situation and make the changes in their lives why you're not praying every day what is your excuse what is your affection is the news in the morning in the evening more is that what the affection is you love to know what's going on well know what's going on straight into hell is that any kind of jump for joy message you have to forgive me you know but i am taking here what paul is teaching and trying to remind us with some clarity of what is our work what is god's responsibility what is the responsibility of the ministry but every individual has to make their calling and election sure and if they have things that i need to do to fix it i want to know and i want to do i don't just want to know what you know i want to do it because plenty people know what to do but they're not doing anything if you really want change you have to know and you have to do be not hearers of the word that's scripture but doers people hear any word here in the world and they don't want to fix the issue how long you'll hold oats and grudges and not forgive and not let go really in 2022 after you hear it for years you're really struggling in 2022 to forgive you really strong in 2022 is that people who not even christians don't understand talk about the law of attraction and forgiving and all kind of thing and you hear any message for all these years i know the virtue of the age is broadly kindness and can't forgive me it's a rebuke to some of us who's supposed to know better you know anybody with me it are people who consistent in the world with their morning affirmations their declarations i am a conqueror i'm gonna make it i'm gonna have a great day and and they spend they don't miss it for the morning and that is their version of their prayer but they are consistent with it and when they finish they feel the right to conquer the world what are you feeding on what is your affection on and for those of you who say well i am praying every morning well pray more push a little more because he could always go higher you can always go fly higher john said i was in the spirit on the lord's day and the word said come up hither come up higher let me show you the things that must be thereafter oh hallelujah somebody say man what are we talking about all of this friends is to turn you into a new creation you know that this old vile wretched body mind everything could be put under subjection and a new you started sharing out that god could use and tabernacle himself can the church say amen in the message and exposition of the seven church ages nine the laodicean church age he said but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as a spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by mary that would have been sinful man producing her body so you hear what brother man was bringing out here that the sperm and the egg in mary was all created by god mary had nothing to do with it that is how much involvement god wants in transforming you till it is not you at all but god is doing something in you so the life that's being produced in you is the seed of god being made manifest and if you could just get out of the way and climb higher automatically that seed oh come on now somebody help me the moment you get into the spirit that seed can't help itself because the cheese of that seed is god himself hallelujah it's not your father it's not your mother it's not your grandfather it's not your grandmother but there's a seed in you that is unstoppable there's a seed in you that cannot die there's a seed in you that can only produce the life of jesus christ there's a seed in you [Music] but if you stay at this level all the time this carnal humanistic realm that seed can't do much but if you like the lily you press past the muck you press past the mire you press past the situation and you peep your head up to get a little higher then all of a sudden the sun could shine on that seed and that seed could only produce after its kind and we'll know what kind of seed it is because it'll show what type of life what type of fruit it is can the church say amen seek those things which are above that would have been sinful a reading against sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was a law a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary but ireland said provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth he was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation hallelujah he was of the new creation because it wasn't the germ of man involved at all it was god who provided a sperm it was god who provided the egg and that made him of the new creation hallelujah [Applause] man and god met and joined and listen to the prophet he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ you heard the scripture you read in colossians we don't want being in christ if any man be in christ i don't care what your pastor says i don't care where he was born i don't care much money you have but if any man be in christ not your foot alone not your head alone not in christ on a sunday not in christ on a wednesday but all of you hid in christ if any man no limitation no restriction for anybody who climbs higher if any man be in christ he is a new creation automatically you connect to that new lineage that spirit walk that spirit talk that defying of your old nature anybody want to preach back to me this morning [Applause] [Music] hallelujah all things have passed away behold all things have become new there you can see in that that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ i'm reading a prophet he has become the new creation of god hallelujah ephesians 2 10 4 we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works ephesians 4 24 and that he put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation listen to the prophet is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is it is a new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh hallelujah that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe a nation he has purposed a new creation is this what you're looking for is this what you're hoping for is this what you need in your life he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man but now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose oh somebody give the lord a shout of praise and this purpose better brandon said took form through election that is why i'm reading he can look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of god friends if he is the author and he's the one writing this new creation and he put my name down as part of this new creation no devil no demon no situation my mistakes my past my failures nothing past nothing present nothing to come could change this fact because he is the author of this creation of god [Applause] his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation you hear but the words the prophet said by his decree when a king or a lawmaker makes a decree it is settled you know i decree hallelujah that you are in this body i decree that you're gonna be a church without spot or wrinkle i decree sin will not be able to live in your members i decree that you are going to overcome i decree you're going to be in the rapture [Music] but a man said by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation so i don't care if they're outside the church right now i don't care if they're backslidden right now i don't care if they're drunk somewhere i don't care if they don't want to hear about god they don't want to hear about church if god has decreed brother you that they are part of this new creation the devil has no power to even stop what god has decreed and declared to be made manifest it is going to come to pass there's a cow now that's going on hallelujah the clock is running because when the god decrees he sets a time he sets an appointed time he sets an appointed season i will return unto you according to the time of life and that promise for you and your family will be made manifest hallelujah by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass time and time again god has never lost one you know god has never lost one never ever ever ever ever lost one hallelujah in every age he found a way he made a way he created a way he opened the door hallelujah my god don't help me oh somebody help me her in every age no matter the situation hallelujah and god had a way of bringing things together to work out hallelujah god could have destroyed the whole of jericho but there was a lady named rahab who was a prostitute who he needed for his long-term plan god could do what he wanted sovereign so he organized it that those spies that he sent had to go and meet rehab and they told rehab when we come back just hang this cord outside of your house and bring your family into this place hallelujah because god has a work for you rahab don't know what about to happen she don't know her destiny she don't know her part to play or somebody help me hallelujah but because she was on the book because she was written in the plan because she was known by the author hallelujah and the author knows how to write the story do you understand that the author writes and however you write it don't ever change from how he writes it oh come on somebody help me this morning hallelujah he knew what day you were going to be born you may be seated rahab didn't know she was going to marry one of joshua's officers and out of that line was going to lead all the way to ober to jesse to david a prostitute in jericho hallelujah god could have done anything and he could have chosen anybody but he wanted rehab because that's how we wrote the story and god is all about this story it's the best story that you could ever write is the best story you could ever tell and it's the only story that we know the end and we know the beginning we oh come on now come on now hallelujah we know how this story ends and that's why satan is so mad [Music] because we can have confidence that we shall reign on this earth hallelujah hallelujah god already see you walking on this earth you realize that god already see you delivered and transformed god already see this take place you know when god looking at rahab he really seeing jesus you know because out of the aligner david house was jesus you know and every rahab wasn't sorted out in her prostitute condition and just think about it friends i preached this before gorkada chose a nice little sister but he find rehab how he can figure out god but but god why you choose do you hear read read rehab resume it oh you could do that i said thank god that it wasn't us because i make rehab go to all kind of things god had to be working on all sides because joshua blessed the marriage of rahab and one of his lieutenants and out of that marriage no time they open and jesse and they don't even know what is happening but god already unfolding and you don't even know how much generations gone past that god really thinking about you you know your great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather somewhere doing something do something and you don't even know when god moved them there somewhere in the world it's really you he was getting at you know you will never know the whole story hallelujah and that's why we have we will have things to talk about when we get to the other side because you don't know the story of how i got here oh come on now but it's the author because he know every piece of the story [Music] we can look back in scripture and make sense out of it because we can look back but at the point in time when these people were living their lives out they had no idea what was happening but they were walking by fate and they were listening to that still small voice and for abraham he was seeking a city whose builder and maker was god his was seeking things that were above he had cattle he had family he had situation even how he dealt with his with his nephew lot spoke to his focus on things above because he said listen lot don't let your men and my men fight i really trying to seek the things above i keep getting interrupted with all these stories about my men and your men fighting you pick east-west notes out and take your people and go you're going with my blessing because i too focus on things above to get interrupted with this argument every tuesday morning every thursday morning and lot goes his way and abraham is focused on things above and it's because he is focusing things above when god comes and visit him and say how shall i hide from myself on abraham what i'm about to do hallelujah i have a man on the earth who seeking things above and because you're on the earth i'm not going to do anything without talking to you so i'm letting you know about to go down to sodom and bring judgment to sodom because if anybody look into things above is you so i letting you know before i had a time whatsoever to happen and because abraham's heart was not done why not do that boy that was real stupid on him and no he was that was in he had any family no he said lord if brad mentioned my ass your wanting and when you read the scriptures it's as if it's as if iran is coming across i don't want to step above my bones eh but let me ask you if it would have 50 righteous would you would you spare them and god say well yes you say well overstepped my bones every time dirty right just would you what what it was in abraham's heart to forgive to love to see just to see reconciliation to see his family in order he said good for autumn i told him to keep praying no no no no he said he's hyper adventure because he's seeking things that are above you can't be seeking around buff and you're walking around grumpy and sad you have to look up your redemptions right now you know i don't care what's happening around you you're supposed to be the happiest people but the man says so you supposed to be happy as you're gonna face idiots [Music] [Applause] happiest people on the face of the earth every day you should be getting a better smile bigger smile every day a bigger bigger smile every day you're getting happier because you know your redemption draenei you're looking up because you know your redemption right now every service you're looking up anybody feeling fine could you take a little more i am on ph one pretty much of this message this morning but if you are you enjoying the word are you being challenged to reprogram your life friends it comes back to decisions and choices you know decisions and choices this whole message this whole gospel is about choices you know jesus said come follow me and those who he called had a choice they had a choice you gonna stand do what you're doing or i cannot follow but thank god they made the right choice you know life and your whole life is about decisions your decisions in life to this point is why you are where you are in every area of your life there are people who save consistently a small amount of money and when they look is the product of the decision to make that that's that one decision and people who consistently support kfc consistent whatever you do you are the sum total of all the decisions you know decision to maintain relationships and friendships and phone calls and contact and support decisions and that's why you can't look at anybody in any kind of way you know because everybody is responsible for their decisions the real question is isn't it time you made better decisions isn't it time you made better choices the bible said choose you this day whom you will serve but rather you're hot or you're cold rather your heart or your cold but you see that warm in between thing all that is a choice you could choose to be hot or you could choose to be cool god isn't saying i will set how you behave for you no what are you going to choose and it shakes me to my core how much of this journey god keeps to himself and how much he leaves to us in our daily living of what we make important years ago so many young people here might remember when i preached a new service i saw all this speech about opportunity cost an opportunity cost is what you give up to do anything else so you have one hour and you have two choices if you're in school you could take that one hour to study your schoolwork or it could be one hour to go and play football it is your choice yes i am saying don't play football and i'm not saying study every single hour of the day but it is your choice the outcome that you get after that decision made over and over and over and over again equals the result you're going to get because for everybody you say my parent held me to study there's somebody who had no parents at all who study for somebody who said i had no electricity study there's somebody with no legacy do you have a scholarship that's it for everybody who has an excuse about something there's somebody else with the exact same situation or worse who made up their minds to do something about it how many orphans became extremely successful at business they had no mentor they had no person they went through the orphanage and they struggled through life but they made a list they might say i am not going to have to be depend and they made a choice a few years ago in brazil or something there's a young boy caught in a picture studying under a street light it went worldwide one of the magazines picked it up because he said he had no electricity at home and while people could be sitting on and complaining about it something within him whatever it was led him to sitting on the street light and study what is different about him and somebody else who accept the situation say well i have no current you know and how is that as much in a natural as amount in the spiritual how much complaining so i want to challenge you i've preached before stop complaining find a solution find a way make a way god put man on the earth to have dominion god will come in the cooler the evening to find out what adam did but adam had a choice of what he named what he did during the day and he had to figure it out and life as a journey in the natural and in his spiritual is figuring it out and we have no excuse because all of the information is there in the bible in the revealed world and test there's courses on everything else you can't cook you could learn i could tell i could make some of the best meals on the planet if you give me the recipe i could challenge the best chefs just give me the recipe give me their secret ingredients huh tell me what you love with herbs and spices the secret ones huh and i could challenge anybody if you know the formula if you're doing the formula you could do anything you know if you could follow instructions and i might tell you do this do this do this do this do this do this do this you'll be able to build x y and z and friends you don't have to remember everything you know you just have to understand how to follow instructions because that's what a recipe is i can't remember every recipe you speak to anybody you can't remember every single recipe but as we have a recipe book maybe it's your grammar book maybe it's your mother book we have a book and you follow because you know that things how much essence and make sure it's just so much essence and it's make sure to add this only in at this time the skill you are displaying is the ability to read and follow instructions as he's saying what he wanted though if you're meditating on this word day and night and you keep going through this word and you look in this word for solutions to your situations and you follow it step by step by step when you need a recipe to deal with your children go to the word and find the recipe that's what the bible is as a guide simple but i am really big on living life as a christian i'm not hearing word word word and can't translate this thing into dealing with your boss and in situations on your neighbor and you're a christian any message you know but you and your neighbor arguing it out shout out to the top of your lungs that can't be christianity to me there has to be a better way there has to be a way to live that people say no that is christ that's christ living out of there i challenge you friends your neighbors must know you're a christian i'm not saying you're you're you're taking abuse so you're taking no no but they must know you're you're christian because you're flying higher you're not caught up in these things can the church take some more this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought to the past by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience that's all knowing and omnipotence that's all power he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his bridges if he did not make sure that's brother branham all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who work in all things after the council of his own will aren't you glad that you belong to him can the church say amen hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer with you in the message feature home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride i'll be changed from this creature that i am when that day comes from going to that city i'm bound for that beautiful city i feel the redeeming power in my whole heart now if this isn't so then i've throwed my life away i've taught others this suitful thing but when i look down and see that the promise he made of this day and see it vindicated and look at this 1500 mile square congregation set here an elect that's been called from the nominations and races and creeds and things gathered together as i see the word vindicating itself i know beyond one shadow of a doubt the jewels of my crown will outshine everything in the world at that day there will come a time people we're not gathering here foreign we're only waiting for that time it is very very late but jesus is still very very near and his glory it's wonderful his name shall be called counselor hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord you appreciate the lord this morning oh hallelujah john in revelation 4. he said after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne friends we need to take our focus our gaze higher above the natural and simple things to look higher into that throne room to look higher into the tapestry and the plan of god to look at the unfolding of the plan of redemption to look at what john saw what paul saw what brother branham saw because we have a place reserved for us at the throne that we didn't work to get it was not by our merit but by the grace of god he allowed it to be so that we as his children could be predestinated hallelujah from before there was a world before there was a time hallelujah and although john was in prison on the isle of patmos as it were he was not looking at the situation but he was caught up looking at things above when the cry went up come up hither above your situation he could have said i'm in prison and i'm not depressed and i don't know why i hear and why me and poor me but he didn't look at his situation hallelujah he didn't look at the situation he just responded come up hither he wasn't looking at his natural imprisonment he wasn't looking at how what he was eating he wasn't looking at what he was going through yes responded to the call to come up hither and it's the same call i'm making this morning to look higher to come up here to look at your redemption to look at the promise to look at your family the way god sees your family delivered shouting worshiping having the baptism of the holy ghost and fire oh hallelujah hallelujah oh brother branham said now tonight with the fourth chapter we're leaving out now john had spoken to the laodicean church age and in this layout of cn church it was the most messed up church age of all the rest of them and we found the most pathetic thing in the last part of the laodicean church jesus standing on the outside of his own church where he had been put out knocking at the door trying to get back in is not sinful i think that's about one of the most pathetic scriptures that i've ever read jesus standing outside of his own door his church had put him out and he was trying to get back in to save them any man i will open let me back in my own house he said i stand at the door i knock you know the scripture i'll support him and he with me isn't it pathetic the god of heaven put out of his own church by their creeds and denominations the way they are doing put them out and accepted it hallelujah immediately after this on the isle of patmos how many remembers hallelujah how can anything happen to a christian without it being for the best god but the enemy is speaking about about john on the isle of patmos he says so what did god get him out there alone in the island for to give us this book of revelation see god just could pull a world over the devil's eyes sometimes so what is better what is brother branham saying here that john's whole trial on the isle of patmos was to pull wool over the devil's eyes your whole trial your situation your confusion whatever you're going through it's pulling hole over the devil's eyes you know hallelujah but everybody said i just love him because i don't have to be smart see if i had smart i tried to forget all about it because i no one could be as smart as him whatever i got i surrender myself to him just do what he says to do that's all sometimes it's very contrary to the way i think it is but i know if he's leaving it he's smart he knows what he's doing i don't so i just let him do it you see that's it hallelujah he's the one knows what he's doing so i just don't try to have any great big flowers and things i just humble myself hallelujah we're getting ready to close out now after this i looked and behold a voice was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were trumpet talking with me saying come up here and i will show these things which must be here after we're going to take it first by first i've got a lot of scriptures written down here i'm just going to touch a few of them as we close out i don't know how far we're going to get into it may the lord lead us after the church and all of this from here after now will be pertaining will take place on earth after the rapture the church see after the rapture this is going back now to pick up israel after the church age after the ages of the church and the church never appears again until revelation in 19th chapter so but the branham is laying on that tapestry here listen to how this scripture we say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and fine linen and clean and white for the fine line in his righteousness of sins and he said unto me blessed that day which are called to the marriage sup of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saiyans of god but there's going to be a meeting in the air one of these days in that sweet bye and by just stay ready keep yourself ready purge your heart from all evil thinking this is in parallel with similar scriptures we have just read friends you have to be seeking the things above you have to be looking for his coming you have to be getting away from the evil thinking have faith in god no matter how dark it looks how many laughs and makes fun and says you've made a mistake keep right on living holy and living for god just keep moving on the hour will arrive the hour will arrive she appears again now in revelation 19 after these things after he had seen the church after these things i looked and behold the door now remember john is still in patmos after he had seen all the church ages go through i looked and beheld a door was open in heaven a door what is the door revelation 3 8 i know that i worked behold i've set before the unopened door that no man can shut it can't shut and no man can open he is the door christ is the door he said i'm the door to the sheepfold oh hallelujah no wolf can't come in without waking him up or sheep can't go out without coming over him oh how safely the sheep feel because the shepherds lay down in the door only one way only one way that goes into the body of christ there's only one door to the church of the living god and jesus is that door i am the door i am the way the road that leads to the door i am the daughter of the sheep for he said to this church each i've set before you an open door he said that to the methodist church aj turned away went informed organization but i've set before you an open door after they receive sanctification i'll put the open door which is the holy spirit by one spirit we are all baptized into one body which is christ why are you saying all these things but isaac because i want to keep the focus on these spiritual things i want you to keep focused on the holy ghost focus on the rapture focus and leave in here focus on things above focus on what your objectives should be focused on getting away from the distraction oh hallelujah harley louie i'll skip some of this and pick it up some of the time oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory glory oh i just want to close out you could begin to play something softly we're just reading through this scripture in colossians not going to spend too much time on it but we read it if he be then risen with christ colossians 3 verse 1 seek those things with our above where christ set it on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth that chapter that verse two there in the amplified set your mind you know i i use the reference of using like a microwave and you're programming you're setting it in the am device has set your mind and keep focus habitually so it must be a habit it must become a habit it must become something that's normal for you it is who you are is what you do prayer is what you do worship is what you do reading the word is what you do it it becomes a habit set your mind and keep focused habitually on the things above the heavenly things not on things that are on the earth which have only temporal value for you are dead and your life is hidden with christ in god in the amplified for you die to this world and your new real life friends there's a real life you know your whole life is on the real one but only when you die out to the old life you can have a real life is hidden with christ in god chapter four when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him and glory and paul is now billion mortified here for your members i've taught this in bible study mortified this is on you in seeking the things that are above this is all part of that teaching mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth which in the amplified so put to death and deprive of power the evil longings of your earthly body that's a choice that you make to kill it put the debt and deprive of power the evil longings of your earthly body which it sends you all self-centered instincts don't tell me you're not dealing with it it's the truth of this body but to win means you make a choice to mortify or kill self-sentencing immorality impurity sinful passion evil desire and greed which is a kind of idolatry because it replaces your devotion to god how many of our young people how many people they're going they're walking they're walking they're walking walking and not realizing that it's an idol you're so exhausted you have no time to pray so exhausted you have no time to spend time thinking about god mortified there for your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness in order to affection evil conscience and covetousness which is idolatry for which things take the wrath of god comment on the children of disobedience so paul is saying these are the reasons these are the things because of these sinful things the divine life of god is coming on the sons of disobedience those who fear to listen to god's word greed you didn't realize greed itself is bringing judgment you say well i'm not fornicating but is there greed and when you look at your life you're so trying to succeed and accomplish and acquire and grieve is what has eaten you up anything that replaces your devotion to god friends set your affection on things above seek those things that are above verse 8 but now he also so beyond these things that paul speaks about put off all these anger are you an angry christian you find myself always upset you're always angry just angry are you ready to put it off and drop that anger sitting in a message for years ago and angry angry at your parents angry at whatever angry at your boss angry at your job angry at your past put off these things you can't carry it with you you know friends put it off nobody quit it off for you you know you have to choose i'm not going to be angry anymore like that song said i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm no longer sin a slave to sin i'm no longer a slave to anger friends you could know the whole message anger cannot go with you it doesn't make sense you know any message and you're carrying this anger because this anger even though you know the message will prevent you from going where you want to go so you have to put it off you're angry with your wife you're angry with your children can you let it go today can you drop the anger you say brother isaac i don't have any odds to do but of course i just upset that just angry can you let the anger just go and let that dark feeling of anger just come out your body out your mind on your heart wrath rat is rage [Music] when you lose control you get so upset that you lose control you throw stuff around the house young brother young sister you're so upset you don't understand why your parents tell you something and you break something you do something you mash up something here are you ready to live higher are you ready to seek the things which are above malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth do you realize that your words that you speak will judge you your very words is what will judge you friends put it off lying not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds you remember the time brother branham was coming over the border into the u.s and he had access children and yeah at the customs border they asked him if he had something and not so whatever it was i can't remember what it was and to the best of his knowledge he knew he didn't have it not realizing one of his children had it and on the way driving when he was a witner but you made me tell them at the border we didn't have it but random turn around his car and that wasn't a christianity documentary that that was a border you know but because your words have such power it was not deliberate lie but it was not true brother branham wanted it corrected and here paul is speaking to believers because this whole scripture here is the you know how it started if he began rising with christ this is the believers and now paul is finding himself coming back to believers lying not one to another seeing seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds if this thing be true that you have really put the old man away make sure and put a witty lion and i've put on a new man which is renewed in knowledge like this service this morning is renewing your knowledge renew their knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian skitty and bond nor free but christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of god so paul is saying put off certain things and now put on certain things as brother branham when he was preaching and put on the whole armor of god he said you have to take off your stuff to put on the armor don't try to put the armor on on top of your stuff so if you're putting off these things then let me tell you what to replace it with put on therefore as the elect of god how many are identified with the elect of god you put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering for bearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you also so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the witch also you are calling one body and be thankful so paul this is a powerful message paul is preaching in is one chapter you know he's telling you what to take off what to put on how to treat one another how to be how to live how to act let the peace of god rule in your heart what's ruling in your heart be thankful are you thankful let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs that's why we have our worship and our song services and these things singing with the grace in your heart to the lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed whatsoever you do on your job in your school to your family whatever you do in word or deed in what you say or in your action do all in the name of the lord jesus can you do everything in the name of the lord then it makes you really think of what you're doing right makes you think of what you're saying because you have to do it in the name of the lord giving thanks to god and the father by him why submit yourselves unto your husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord is a gospel here in this one chapter for everybody fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants obey and all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fear in god and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance so you're not working on your job and you're a christian and you're working and you're working with a man that is against scripture you're under the man walk that's not scripture whatever you do do it unto the lord knowing the lord will give you your inheritance hallelujah for he served the lord christ but he that do it wrong shall receive for the wrong which he had done and there is no respect of prisons may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads a word of prayer heavenly father this simple message this morning lord and to seek those things which are above to remind us through your word and to your scripture and to your prophet's message and true lord these words of encouragement that we have to climb so high that these petty things can't go with us lord help us to break past the sound barriers in our lives lord and to realize that we have much more room to climb and much more land to be taken and father may you bless your
