[1:22:15] now from all the sixth ah there was this
[1:22:18] darkness all over the land under the
[1:22:20] $9.00 about the ninth hour Jesus cried
[1:22:23] with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama

[1:22:45] lies will come to save him and Jesus
[1:22:49] when he had cried again with a loud
[1:22:50] voice yielded up the ghost and behold
[1:22:53] the veil of the temple was rent and
[1:22:56] praying from the top to the bottom and
[1:22:58] it did quake rocks rent the graves are
[1:23:02] open many bodies of the saints which
[1:23:04] slept arose and came out of the graves
[1:23:07] after his resurrection and went under
[1:23:10] the holy city and appeared at the many
[1:23:11] now when the Centurion and they that
[1:23:14] were with him watching Jesus saw the
[1:23:16] earthquake and those things that were
[1:23:19] done they feared greatly saying truly
[1:23:21] this was the son of God
[1:23:24] hebrews chapter 10 we were misled 11 and
[1:23:32] every priest and that daily ministering
[1:23:34] and offering of times the same sacrifice
[1:23:36] which can never take away sins but this
[1:23:39] man after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:23:42] for sins forever sat down on the right
[1:23:45] hand of God from henceforth expect him
[1:23:48] till his enemies be made his footstool
[1:23:50] for by one offering he had perfected
[1:23:54] forever them that are sanctified we're
[1:23:57] off of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:58] also his witness to us for after that he
[1:24:02] had said before this is the Covenant
[1:24:05] that I will make with them after those
[1:24:06] days saith the Lord I will put my laws
[1:24:09] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:24:11] will I write them and their sins and
[1:24:13] iniquities will I remember no more
[1:24:14] nowhere nowhere remission of sin is
[1:24:18] there is no more offering for sin having
[1:24:20] therefore brethren boldness to enter
[1:24:23] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:24:26] by a new and living way which he had
[1:24:29] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:24:31] is to say is flesh
[1:24:33] and having a high priest over the house
[1:24:35] of God let us draw near with a true
[1:24:38] heart in full assurance of faith having
[1:24:41] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:24:43] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:24:46] pure water let us hold fast the
[1:24:48] profession of faith without wavering for
[1:24:49] he is faithful
[1:24:51] that's promised and let us consider one
[1:24:54] another to provoke unto love and to good
[1:24:56] works not forsaking the assembling of
[1:24:59] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:25:01] is but exhorting one another and so much
[1:25:03] the more as we see that they approach it
[1:25:06] our last script of immersion 10 reading
[1:25:09] from verse 8 and the voice which I hid
[1:25:11] from heaven speaking to me again saying
[1:25:13] go and take the little book which is
[1:25:15] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:25:17] standard upon the scene upon the earth
[1:25:19] and I went into the angel and said unto

[1:25:23] me take it heat it up and it shall make
[1:25:25] thy belly bitter but it shall be 9
[1:25:27] multitude as honey and I took the little
[1:25:29] book out of the Angels hand and eat it
[1:25:31] up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and
[1:25:33] as soon as I've eaten it my belly was
[1:25:36] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:25:38] prophesy again before many towns and

[1:43:40] because the rapture is in you oh let's
[1:43:53] go where Adam sinned by hidden to his
[1:44:04] wife's reasoning instead of holding the
[1:44:07] godswood that is what made Adam sin his
[1:44:10] wife reason with Seaton and then
[1:44:12] produced a product Adam I don't turn
[1:44:15] loose the word and sold out he lost also
[1:44:18] his inheritance when he lost his
[1:44:21] fellowship and right to life so he lost
[1:44:26] everything his right to life his
[1:44:29] fellowship and as inheritance he lost
[1:44:32] everything
[1:44:33] and Satan waiting for the book because
[1:44:35] Satan know it have a deed it has some
[1:44:40] legal authority considered old because
[1:44:43] he is a squatter because he got kicked
[1:44:46] off heaven so he looking for some place
[1:44:48] at himself so he wanted always to be the
[1:44:52] Prince of the power of the air
[1:44:53] he wanted me charged he trial and skull
[1:44:56] up in heaven he had a lust in his heart
[1:44:58] to be like the Most High
[1:45:00] he wanted to have access to power and
[1:45:03] authority that was Satan wanted so when
[1:45:05] he form a cool and get some other
[1:45:07] bastard ninja with him to try to
[1:45:10] overthrow the throne of God Michel
[1:45:12] Fortin attacked and forth and then he
[1:45:14] got boots then he fell and he hurt and
[1:45:17] the back of angel became the back of men
[1:45:19] so he was always an agony looking at
[1:45:22] even know how godless man even when I
[1:45:24] was in spirit form in Genesis one Satan
[1:45:27] didn't Camaro Satan never come around he
[1:45:30] never come on Adam original spirit but
[1:45:33] when in Genesis 2 he formed man of the
[1:45:35] dust of the earth he push out on inside
[1:45:37] Allah and silla come along but when he
[1:45:39] Pilate by-products call Eve I went to
[1:45:43] work
[1:45:44] until the soil there come that slip
[1:45:46] devil talking to Adam life and that is
[1:45:49] hold the whole business either come
[1:45:51] inside idea that's all mine fell because
[1:45:53] Adam loved his wife and the whole
[1:45:55] tuition cell with him but God purpose to
[1:45:58] restore full access do you believe that
[1:46:08] hallelujah
[1:46:09] my God my God hallelujah praise God
[1:46:14] remember accesses permission Liberty
[1:46:18] ability to enter to approach pass to off
[1:46:22] from a place or to communicate with a
[1:46:24] person or thing so I have this written
[1:46:26] and I read this on Wednesday night and
[1:46:28] appendices on the issue has always been
[1:46:30] accessed upon Authority Lucifer he
[1:46:33] wanted to be like the Most High
[1:46:34] attempted a coup in heaven and even got
[1:46:37] some angels to make an effort a system
[1:46:39] to be in a position of authority that he
[1:46:41] can be worshipped and when the Battle of
[1:46:43] Angels fell on the earth man was no
[1:46:45] longer a spirit being as in Genesis one
[1:46:48] but now the spirit man was now in flesh
[1:46:50] as in Genesis two Lucifer's job was to
[1:46:54] get access to the main and place wisdom
[1:46:57] and knowledge ahead of the word
[1:47:00] hallelujah he did that to Eve a
[1:47:02] byproduct of the original and true Eve
[1:47:05] Adam took a bite and fell the devil
[1:47:08] don't have to hit you direct he can use
[1:47:10] others to get to you man fell from the
[1:47:13] sixth sense of faith the five senses of
[1:47:15] the flesh be ncts touch feel and smell
[1:47:19] and of the spirit imagination memory or
[1:47:22] conscience affection and reasoning the
[1:47:24] sixth sense was the only sense given to
[1:47:27] contact God to relate to God see it anew
[1:47:31] if we could break the connection man
[1:47:34] would no longer have access and he
[1:47:36] Lucifer would remain in charge of the
[1:47:38] earth forever Roman as the Prince of the
[1:47:41] power of the air once he could break the
[1:47:44] connection man would no longer be online
[1:47:46] with God but man will be pushed into
[1:47:50] offline mode
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] to be on his own in five senses so
[1:47:58] access to heaven was no denied the ease
[1:48:01] of access that Adam had was no longer
[1:48:03] there he knew he once had it he was
[1:48:06] number one Laura this fit was an atom
[1:48:08] was give Adam access to God and the five
[1:48:12] senses give Adam access to the earth but
[1:48:14] God's purpose was to restore defeat back
[1:48:18] to the sons of God to give us full
[1:48:21] access so he sent the Prophet Malachi
[1:48:24] for William a young man to turn our
[1:48:27] hearts back to the fit and the fit is
[1:48:30] the key to gain access or get the Lord

[2:26:45] with you it was like a sheet of
[2:26:49] blackness fallen from heaven it
[2:26:52] literally paralyzed the earth
[2:26:54] it showed every creature of bondage of
[2:26:57] God's creation at the bondage man was
[2:26:59] under bondage of debt sickness troubles
[2:27:03] sorrows if Adam only know that
[2:27:07] investment he made in the bite of that
[2:27:09] Apple
[2:27:10] he might that change he - I invite in
[2:27:12] Latin because it brought out sickness
[2:27:15] sorrow death every trouble earlier today
[2:27:18] Adam for doing what he did and every
[2:27:24] creature on earth was subjugated
[2:27:25] everyone born it were savages so it had
[2:27:27] to come from someplace where there was
[2:27:29] no sin therefore when man realized he
[2:27:32] was separated from his God he become a
[2:27:34] wanderer they wept they cried they
[2:27:37] toiled they wander to mountains to the
[2:27:39] desert seeking a city whose builder and
[2:27:41] maker is God for him knew if he could
[2:27:43] ever get back in the presence of God he
[2:27:46] could talk it over with him but there
[2:27:48] was no way back so he was lost

[2:51:20] price
[2:51:20] suddenly Christian music on please but
[2:51:23] he did that that we could follow him
[2:51:25] what must be do the first thing I wanted
[2:51:28] you to see is this Jesus never live for
[2:51:30] himself his life was spent for others
[2:51:33] that is perfectly tuned their life when
[2:51:35] you see you go to church and you do good
[2:51:37] things and that's fine
[2:51:38] but when you live your life to yourself
[2:51:40] you haven't eaten life yet the eternal
[2:51:42] life is living for others and it proved
[2:51:44] it when it comes the Lamb of God and
[2:51:46] lift it up someone said how can you
[2:51:48] stand and let anybody call you bad names
[2:51:50] you don't lift yourself you live for
[2:51:52] others that you might redeem that man
[2:51:57] you are taking Christ's place you are
[2:52:01] sons you don't live for yourself he said
[2:52:04] all my I hope this helps this tabernacle
[2:52:06] and all the people has got to and so on
[2:52:08] or praise the name of the Lord
[2:52:11] I'm gonna close the greater works was to
[2:52:15] have the power in the church not only to
[2:52:18] heal the sick by prayer or cast out
[2:52:21] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[2:52:24] life to believers the Holy Ghost was
[2:52:28] coming and given into the hands of the
[2:52:29] church to impact life that is what
[2:52:31] Calvary meant by given the Holy Ghost to
[2:52:34] obediently delivers men who owns
[2:52:37] unbelievers they made believers and
[2:52:39] impart spirit in their life
[2:52:41] so listen don't you see what the great
[2:52:43] thing is that's the greatest thing you
[2:52:45] could ever happen was to impart it in
[2:52:47] their life the people are closer to
[2:52:49] school I won't stop but I leave it alone
[2:52:52] this is super important
[2:52:56] listen close as we close that he's losin
[2:52:57] to something at Calvary God came down
[2:53:04] and took the body of his son in which he
[2:53:07] had lived he ripped it apart at Calvary
[2:53:10] his bleedin wounded cut the spear
[2:53:14] running there ripping apart his blood
[2:53:16] gushed out he said father into thy hands
[2:53:19] I commend my spirit he pulled his head
[2:53:21] and the earth shook lightning flashed

[2:53:32] from sack the others are the high
[2:53:34] priests of the memorial secondary

[2:53:37] and he sent the spirit that he taught
[2:53:40] all of that body right back down on the
[2:53:43] church and that church will have to have
[2:53:48] the same spirit that was in that body or
[2:53:52] it won't deal with it in the
[2:53:54] resurrection so the same spirit faithful
[2:53:58] to knowledge temperance patience called

[3:24:53] over this morning was epic that's the
[3:24:55] only word I could find this morning was
[3:24:57] epic you know so I truly believe that we
[3:25:01] have turned a corner but random said
[3:25:03] anybody could build a straight wall but
[3:25:06] it take a real stonemason master Neeson
[3:25:09] to turn the corner and I believe as we
[3:25:11] come in on to the end of this season we
[3:25:13] have turned a corner and as we turn this
[3:25:15] corner I see the finish line right ahead
[3:25:17] because we don't have too much time left
[3:25:20] hallelujah and we have the access to get
[3:25:23] everything and we need to finish the
[3:25:25] rest of this journey can the church
[3:25:26] shame and hallelujah so we have some
[3:25:31] notes of praise I mean some prayer
[3:25:33] requests from Andy and sister Victoria
[3:25:36] and sister palm from mourning scenes
[3:25:38] after a wonderful service last Sunday
[3:25:40] Seaton tried to steal your joy by us
[3:25:43] being involved in a car accident on our
[3:25:46] way home but Satan is a liar he is
[3:25:49] defeated no one was hurt
[3:25:50] so we tangoed for life and faced mercy
[3:25:53] over our lives that's up that's a reason
[3:25:56] to thank God that's a reason to thank
[3:25:59] God hallelujah hallelujah and that's
[3:26:03] what a devil tries to do you know try to
[3:26:05] cut you off try to cut off Moses at the
[3:26:08] cutoff of Jesus but he can do it he
[3:26:13] could try but he can do it hallelujah
[3:26:15] hallelujah hmm another note of praise
[3:26:18] from Adam Michael Williams Tang in God
[3:26:20] after prayers was offered up for Jared
[3:26:22] Forbes last Sunday he's out of the coma
[3:26:24] home and doing well tank in the church
[3:26:26] and scenes for answered prayers
[3:26:30] still a prayer answering God never
[3:26:33] change never field seemed yesterday
[3:26:36] today and forever
[3:26:37] and whether Branham said it the same
[3:26:39] conditions are meant like wasn't a day
[3:26:41] of Pentecost it'll happen again if he
[3:26:44] did it for the sinner he could do it for
[3:26:46] you if he did it for the sick he could
[3:26:48] do it for you it doesn't matter what you
[3:26:51] did
[3:26:51] it's he doing the work and the church
[3:26:53] same and so as we approach the throne of
[3:26:56] grace we have prayer requests here for
[3:27:00] Josiah for DES there's a son of Berta
[3:27:03] Stephens friend who is severely ill is
[3:27:05] it Crohn's disease with Crohn's disease
[3:27:08] please fear for a total and complete
[3:27:10] healing and better Stephen says he
[3:27:12] believed that all things are possible
[3:27:13] through Christ and we know this to be
[3:27:15] the truth
[3:27:16] and nothing nothing but the truth and
[3:27:19] from sister Jonah who is leaving to go
[3:27:22] back to st. Vincent on Friday asking God
[3:27:24] for traveling mercies and if there's
[3:27:26] anyone in the house this morning that
[3:27:28] you didn't get to put a request but you
[3:27:30] have one in your heart that you want to
[3:27:32] show by raise of hands as we approach
[3:27:34] the throne of God collectively together
[3:27:37] this morning the Bible says if two shall
[3:27:41] agree touching anything so we come in
[3:27:43] agreement become an agreement as a
[3:27:46] church this morning no word has already
[3:27:48] gone forth and the word itself is power
[3:27:50] but this gospel is not in word only it
[3:27:53] is also in power and demonstration so
[3:27:55] we're looking for the word to be
[3:27:57] demonstrated this morning
[3:27:59] can we borrow here so we're afraid our
[3:28:01] gracious Heavenly Father we are so
[3:28:03] humbled Lord to walk in your presence a
[3:28:06] presence that we did nothing to deserve
[3:28:08] we did nothing to earn father every
[3:28:11] attempt that we have made to do right
[3:28:13] Lord has been a failure because without
[3:28:15] you we are nothing
[3:28:17] law we've thank you that Lord we could
[3:28:19] not even keep ourselves but you have
[3:28:21] been keeping us you have been holding
[3:28:24] our hands you have been guiding us how
[3:28:27] to walk where to walk when to go how to
[3:28:29] go in our moments of weakness Lord you
[3:28:32] are our strength because you taught us
[3:28:34] that your strength can only be made
[3:28:36] perfect
[3:28:37] when we are weak so we thank you for the
[3:28:40] mountains and we thank you for the
[3:28:41] valleys we thank you for the trials and
[3:28:44] the testings that you and your wisdom
[3:28:46] Lord send our way to build a character
[3:28:48] so we could be perfect and you could
[3:28:51] walk before you perfect as you said to
[3:28:54] Abraham Lord so many hundreds of years
[3:28:56] ago we thank you for this service this
[3:28:59] morning and how you use your man's
[3:29:01] servant Lord and the anointing Lord I
[3:29:04] was under word because the anointing
[3:29:06] itself is what makes the difference any
[3:29:08] man can read the structure but it takes
[3:29:11] the Holy Ghost up bring it to life a
[3:29:13] spiritual food in due season so we thank
[3:29:16] you for the spiritual food Lord that has
[3:29:19] been shared out this morning Lord from
[3:29:21] the banquet of heaven father we are full
[3:29:24] this morning and our cups are running
[3:29:26] over this morning
[3:29:27] Oh God but before we leave father we
[3:29:30] have requests that Lord have been
[3:29:32] presented to your throne for you to look
[3:29:34] over them and decide how to do father
[3:29:37] let me bring Josiah for before you Lord
[3:29:40] severely ill with Crohn's disease Lord
[3:29:42] and Lord every single disease he brought
[3:29:45] before you you had a remedy for every
[3:29:48] disease and even when Lazarus expire and
[3:29:52] tied up you were able to bring him back
[3:29:54] father so Lord as where the Stephens
[3:29:56] head we stand believing this morning
[3:29:58] that all things are possible through
[3:30:00] Christ we pray that angel of the Lord
[3:30:03] will find your side wherever years may
[3:30:06] you walk into the room where he is and
[3:30:08] may you touch him from the crown of his
[3:30:10] head to the soles of his feet Lord I
[3:30:12] made this request become a note of
[3:30:14] praise and unexplained note of praise
[3:30:17] Lord because it'll take the
[3:30:19] miracle-working power of God but
[3:30:21] transform things father me you step into
