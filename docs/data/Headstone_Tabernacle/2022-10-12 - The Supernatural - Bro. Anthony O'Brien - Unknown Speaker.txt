just get this real quick want to read from amen let me just set this up quick amen so St John 4 scene John 4 and verse 21 to 24 thereabouts we want to uh read for scripture amen just for sort of short exhortation tonight praise God to stay on the firing line amen praise God so Saint John 4 21 and it says Jesus saith unto her woman believe me this is Jesus speaking to the woman of the well right he said Jesus sent that a woman believe me the hour cometh when he shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour coming and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him and verse 24 says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth may God blessing to the Ring of his word let's just bow heads one more time Heavenly Father we've read your word tonight and we thank you for it Lord your word that has Lord been Everlasting throughout all ages father and Lord is still true tonight Lord your word will never fail us and so father we thank you Lord father for revealing yourself to us in these last days we pray tonight for a few moments Lord as we lord as we uh as we as we dwell on these scriptures tonight Lord your presence would come and speak to your people o god father Lord have a small tort here tonight but I pray dear God that your anointing would come and make it alive Lord Father Make It present tense to your people Lord that Lord will Quicken you will tell us father Lord for these last days that we're living in power Lord father and fill us with all of you and more more of you tonight Lord Founders you wait upon you tonight granted almighty God we pray and ask it in Jesus name amen and amen praising him the Lord let me have your seats here amen praise God so I have a thought here tonight my thought is the supernatural that's my thought amen the supernatural praise God and he said I've taken my context straight out of verse 24 where Jesus speaking he says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth praise God Hallelujah the supernatural amen that's my thought tonight and that's a thought that just kind of was dwelling on my mind and begin to think about how God is a spirit praise God he's not your friend around the corner he's not someone you know he's not a man that he would lie but he's a spirit praise God he's not a natural thing it's a supernatural thing praise God it come from a supernatural place the word of God comes from a supernatural place doesn't come from man's not man's idea it's not man's opinion it's not what we think about it but it is the thoughts of God Express into the word of God and that's what brought us here tonight not a natural man not a natural thing but a supernatural car doing a supernatural thing in our lives age to age he has remained the same and he is the same tonight oh we serve a supernatural God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and that's what just keep rooting on my mind because you know you hear it and you talk about it and you you've said it so many times before but when you really dwell on it begin to realize that this world is not your home this natural behavior this natural thing that you're accustomed to this is not where you belong you belong somewhere else and God himself is a supernatural being he always was he always is he is tonight he exists tonight he can hear you tonight he can hear your prayer he can hear your cry he can hear your plea he can hear the desire of your hearts and nights he's just alive tonight as a person son sitting next to you as a person standing in front of you or just as real as we are here tonight God is real and he is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirits and in truth not in your flesh or not in your feelings not in your emotions but in the spirits oh John Heard a Voice said come up hither I have something to show you come up out of your flesh come up out of your atmosphere come about where you come from come out of your neighborhood come out of your friendships come out of your circles break out of the natural and get into the supernatural where all things are possible where the sick and be healed what a blind can see where the cripples can walk where the gospel is preaching is power that's what the Supernatural is oh somebody say man somebody say hallelujah oh I'm so thankful that hey I'm so thankful tonight Hallelujah glory to God to please believe in this Supernatural God because this natural world can't do it for me when this natural rule run all the answers when they run out of ideas when there's no more hope left when there's no more answers for the world left what will you look to David said I look into the hills from winds come in my help my Help Cometh From God might have don't come from no natural source my help comes from a supernatural source of Jacob's will could never do but I could draw from this well and if you drink from this well tonight you'll never tell second because it's supernatural there's every Power every anointing every presence in the Supernatural to heal the sick to raise a dead to open the blind eyes to make the cripples walk oh you are limited in yourself but With God all things are possible all things shall be made known oh Hallelujah [Applause] amen you believe it tonight God is a supernatural being Supernatural person he's not a natural person I know we hear it but I want you to dwell on it just long enough for it to saturate begin to understand is not natural he's not an animal he's not an object he's not a thing he's a spirit he's a real person but in a world where you can't see or you can't see with your natural eyes oh but you gotta have faith tonight to know that he is there that he is listening to you when the prophet was given his testimony about the squares he was talking to the Brethren sharing them the power of God and the awesomeness of God and sister happy right was there listening she was listening to what he was saying and then all of a sudden she rise up and said that's the truth and all of a sudden hot God touches prophets and say whatever that lady asked for till I give it to her oh so you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me tonight God was right in the room listening to Sister how do you write or he heard when she said he heard what she said that's the truth part of random oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and I tell you God is listening to you right now you might not feel him but he is there you might not be aware of him but he's very aware of you and everywhere you go in and he thinks that you're doing the secrets of his agents is on the earth now looking for a bride to be positionally placed and you're going to be placed by your car knock your character your behavior how you could conduct yourself a Mr trials that he and his wisdom sends your way when you speak and say though he slay me yet I trust him the secrets of his agents the Supernatural is taking notes all behind the glass oh hallelujah hallelujah they're taking notes looking at you to see your action to see your behavior to see how you conduct yourself in the trial if you're gonna fly off the handle or if you're gonna conduct yourself like God if you're going to have the godliness if you're gonna have probably kindness if you're going to have the temperance in the midst of the trial when people curse in your face when people call you a talk where people say this against you that's against you when they try to cut you and destroy you and assassinate your character you can stand there like a Son of God and say don't enslave me yeah [Applause] [Music] like and then God takes dose of that and he goes back to the father and he says you won't believe what your son just said you won't believe what your son just did oh Hallelujah he did this I did this to him I did that to him and he still rise up God is a good God God is faithful and he's true he said that's wonderful he's coming on give him some more trials give him a little more time good huh give them a little more season it out Joseph before his work came the word of the Lord Tried Him try Joseph Holly Joseph knew God don't show good just the end of the vision but what Joseph don't know is the time and the season when it will be fulfilled he just had a hole on my pitch and believed that what God revealed to him by a dream would be manifested in time and season but he don't know when that is so he just had to wait there he has a gift he has the anointing he has the ability to do what God called him to do but yet God put him in time make him sit down in a prison make him wait make him question could it be make him stay there wait upon the word I mean all his reason and fell away the only thing that remained was a word was a vision that God had given him and I tell you tonight when all the humanists pulled away when all of our thoughts all of our cares all of our ideas get dried out the only thing that will remain is this word that the prophet caref there shall be a pride there shall be oh Hallelujah a manifestation or oh Hallelujah Glory of these seven unknown Turners to wake her up again he will send it he will promise it that's the only hope we've got that's the only hope the church Got Tonight is a Dynamics to the mechanics it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's the only hope that young people have tonight is the Holy Fire of God to come down in the soul and break Lucifer and break demons out of their hearts chains of Darkness will be broken by the power of the Living God there will be a visitation to the young people don't you forget that oh hallelujah praise God oh it might not happen yet but it shall be because it's not natural Supernatural oh you know what I'm saying today do you know the god it's God Supernatural that spoke the word in the beginning it's not right so therefore the word itself didn't come from a natural place I'll say that again the word itself the word are we preaching tonight now we'll be leaving on tonight now we've been believing all these years that word didn't come from a natural place that wasn't written on some Scrolls somewhere that wasn't some guy fought it up that wasn't some imagination or some affection or some human reasoning that was a word of God spoken through a prophet that prophesied let there be oh Hallelujah and I tell you tonight oh we are Standing on the Promises of God we are standing on oh we on the perch of it we are on the verge of a mighty or pouring of the Holy Ghost and Fire one night the world has never seen before it will rock it will shake this world it will rock it to its core oh because it's not just one Thunder it's seven Thunders banging one two three four five six seven banging right close together oh another Ephesians or one more Church there have been Brides brides churches churches but there must come one that will slap the devil in his face there must come one who will be victorious there must come one who will raise up the dead in Christ and then she'll take a flight to the skies it must come one oh Hallelujah glory to God oh you're gonna have to help me preaching that amen wow it comes from a supernatural place spoken by a super natural God it's not right but a Brandon said here on the message called the supernatural 1956 he says we're all hungry for the supernatural you met at this Brethren are hungry for the supernatural I got a message here with me he said that he's hungering and thirsting for the supernatural he said you Baptist it's called a lot of different groups now she said you're hungry Supernatural too yeah all of them are he said now surely if God is still God then he is still Supernatural he said do you believe that he's got to be am I he said no we're trying to place God in some prehistoric uh some historical God in other words a god of the past a god of what he's done a god of the testimony it's not right people love to talk about brother Branham and the Miracles I'm dead and how he healed the sick and how would Abraham did so many things and it's not right Hallelujah they were Witnesses of that that's good Hallelujah but God is doing something right now typical man is always looking at what hey God has done looking forward to what God will do God will do a Rapture that's right go to the carry bread home that's right but question what is God doing right now what is God doing in our midst what is God doing at us tonight a handful of people in Trinidad and Tobago but conquer two sorry oh we might look like much but if God be with you then you shall be able to drive out the Philistines in your life the Philistines in your home the Philistines on your job the Philistines wherever you can meet the devil on any ground he comes upon because he got something within you that's holding the range oh I know demon can stand before you 100 000 Devils to ten thousand follow my right side they will say I shall not be moved oh hello because it's not natural what call you to this message is not natural what call it to the church tonight is not natural oh I fought you Devils to get here tonight oh I'm not going to go back the same no no I gotta get one inch closer gotta get one foot closer gotta get one step closer gonna claw my way to the promise of God I come too far to turn back now I need a holy ghost I need a burden inside my soul I need a fire I need a presence to go with me on the streets in the bank wherever I go let his Spirit follow me that's what I want tonight his spirit is Supernatural being Supernatural presence when you walk in the hospital oh hi all the demons begin to shake why because what's around you is Supernatural oh Hallelujah that's our promise God wants us to live in a supernatural had a taste of it you know the blessings of God oh you know the drippings the blessings but you don't know the power of God you don't know when that God packs you out somewhere in a room and he said for days he's telling the anointing you have to pinch himself he had to try and figure out if he in a dream if he in our vision or if he in the real world right now with his wife and children he don't know first the power of God over him so he anointed over him so that's the supernatural that's what the Supernatural is when the Revival gets ready to break out the window when the mothers can't even wash your pots such the anointing flowing people praying and breaking out in tongues Holy Ghost and Fire take over the house when they came out of the upper room they were like drunk men they were staggering they didn't know what their name was they didn't know how they came there they can't remember they walk and they take a donkey cart if there was on a horse they can't remember all they know is that they caught up in the Supernatural and that's how I want to get to night I wanna get so drunk I forget what my name is all I know is my name is written in the last book of life and he sealed my soul with the fire of God and I can't be the same and I can't stay silent oh somebody shouting man [Music] Hallelujah Glory well I believe it's gonna happen one of these days oh then this church will be packed there will not be enough room here to fill the people when they come hungry and assisted looking for a supernatural looking for reality they talk on the ground oh God whatever you have I want Jets whatever you have I need it I need it I need a holy ghost I need a power I need an anointing upon you I see that presence oh you better make sure when that time comes the door isn't already shut because God will anoint the church then when the door is shut when no blood flash could be safe that's when the anointing will strike home so get in line tonight huh okay all right well I lost my place okay all right some historical goal right he say what what the good does it do a historical God for today what benefit is God of Elijah to a man today if he isn't the same God it's got to be the same God today right as he was back then people talk about what the prophet did but people failing to see that God is getting a church ready today to do what that Prophet did to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast our Devils he's getting a group to get up now to fulfill that to fulfill this pyramid here or to have all these virtues in her that's what he's preparing our pride for now to do the same thing cool same word slave same life same signs same wonders same Miracle same power same Supernatural presence that's what's promised us tonight amen and I just want to also focus on that for a few minutes amen while we got this over here tonight amen oh my what are you learning about him in a seminary for well if he was some historical fact and not the same today then you'd better be you it's better you learn agriculture or something professor you wasting a Time basically is what he's saying he said if he's not the same God today if he can't do the same things he did yesterday or the day before if he's not consistently God then his best way golden agriculture or something or something that would help somebody is that right some kind of psychology or something right he said you'd be better off if you learned your children to be an architect instead of a minister if he's a historical God if he's not the same today what good does a god of Moses do Tom Hunt today if he is in the same God today oh but we know tonight he's the same God today he's the same yesterday he's the same today and he's the same forever oh he's the same God I walk with Moses he's the same God I walk with Jacob and Joseph who spoke to his servants throughout the ages age to age he's still the same just imagine Luther or had a church with people in it and they believe God for the age and that was so many years ago you could look back and look at Wesley and the people at their time and they had a Revival and that was so many years ago but they stood for God in their age oh what are we doing here tonight what are we doing here in this church we are standing for God in our age oh we are standing for God in our time in our season and the devil is very scared oh hallelujah what are we going to become because this is the final age there's no more ages to come so therefore this is the final age then that means this is a great Crescendo this is a great climax this is a great epiphany of all the ages of all the things that have been manifested before God's Gonna culminate God's Gonna gather them all together oh that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ what did he do what did he do somebody answer me tonight he pours it into the church or other church tonight is made up of individuals one over here one over there one over there one in norima one in San Diego one in chagones one in colupiah one in San Fernando there is my spirit flowing freely one in South Africa one in Nigeria one in North America South America wherever oh God has its seeds out oh that time is coming soon we Randall said God like to let the message run down until it become common until people relax and they get along in the message they get all days and Duty praise God and begin to say oh Lord you let it come in then they got to get into our atmosphere with his heart clown at one another and evil surmising and back Python and whatnot huh he gets so accustomed to not having the spirit of God a myths around them that they don't even know any disappears because they never had it to begin with but there is another people in the land tonight who under their under their messenger would be the final voice to the final age they're gonna live they're gonna be influenced by the supernatural the supernatural will walk with you it will come out of you it'll heal the sick he will make himself known to your family to your friends to your loved ones they're going to know a new difference they're gonna know when you talk different they're going to know when you walk their front even the devil will know when you walk different he said Paul I know Peter I know and he's going to say you I know also you gotta testimony that you please call and you have this in your being walking on two feet God will know when you've got that he'll try to squeeze it out but it'll be too late amen there'll be one more amen oh man I'm trying to get through this all right I had a little portion here I want to read from a guy by Dr Francis Collins and he's a big scientist guy and they had an article in him on PBS but he's also a Christian so he's great High intellectual scientific guy but he's also a Christian and this is how he describes I just want to read something they thought I'd Inspire he just this is how he describes the difference between God and science or between God and the natural he says if God is who God claims to be he said and who I believe he is then he is not explainable in natural terms he said he's outside of our natural world outside of space and time he said so if God listen to this he said if God choose to intervene from time to time in our natural world by allowing the occurrence of miraculous events then I do not see why that is an illogical possibility in other words he's saying I don't see how it's impossible for a God who dwells outside of space and time for every once in a while when he has the need to he could step into your natural world and bring divine intervention and to cause things that happen and bring miraculous events and then step back out and watch the scene unfold you don't see how that's impossible because he's higher than us the Bible's head is ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are high and our thoughts our thoughts will perish in a day but God's thoughts are Eternal but God thoughts the Norris remain thoughts one day God spoke his thoughts and those thoughts became my word and that is what we have here tonight so when he says I am the Lord that he let all thy diseases when he says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption that's not man's thoughts that is God's thoughts being expressed that is him intervening in your life when he chooses to when he has needs to he will step in and he will step back out and watch a scene unfold oh somebody praise him tonight I'm so happy I'm so glad that I'm not leaning on man I'm not leaning on my own understanding but I'm leaning on the understanding of God I'm leaning on the supernatural I'm leaning on a being because God is a spirit and they don't worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth I'm not worshiping him my flashlight but I have an understanding he has opened our understanding to the scriptures to understand who he is what he is Who We Are Who The Devil is and what our promises in this heart oh I can't settle anything less God has already revealed himself and to whom much is given much is expected tonight Hallelujah yeah oh who do you say this is foreign Look what comes Sunday who shall I sell unto the hill of the Lord and who shall stand in his holy place he that had Clean Hands and up your heart then if he's a supernatural God then question what is your approach to the supernatural God what is your attitude how do you come to church what is your mindset what is your spirit like what is your attitude what is your behavior oh what is your desire he is a high and lofty one that dwelled with him that had a contrite hearts and a broken Spirit he's looking for a contrite Hearts he's looking for a pro-conspirator now you gotta break yourself when you come into the presence of God John Jacob job said I am home myself in a retired repentance and Ashes that's the attitude that God is looking for or he don't want no high and mighty the proud he resisted or the proud look he pushing down a far off he don't know what that is that disgusts him all the proud looks in the message all the proud religious people come into church thinking that the holy thinking that they could do it for themselves what a play would be able to be in when God died for all of us when all of us was in sin all of us wasn't filled all of us was up to our necks all of us was about to drown in the river or that the devil had set for us oh but he raised me up so I could stand on mountains he gave me a foot to stand on he gave me a promise he gave me a rock and a rock is Christ the reason I'm here tonight is because of Jesus Christ and nobody else and nothing else there's no power in it that can help me only God can help me and in my hour of need he is there in my hour oh Hallelujah when I've run out of options he is the answer oh he's the entrepreneur today he's the answer for every Circumstance the answer of every situation the answer for everything that you desire in your heart he can fulfill it tonight he can water you he can bless you he can fill you give your asses higher your satisfying Porsche oh Hallelujah Supernatural when Moses come down of the mountain the Bible said there's countenance was different you could tell that the man had been somewhere that affected him greatly Beyond nature whatever Moses was before they put in Bush experience he was different after that whatever Behavior he had before the burning bush he was completely changed after that he spoke different he spoke as one having an authority he went straight up to pharaoh he grew up with him fellas he wasn't always any wilderness he grew up in in Egypt in Pharaoh Palace he know all of them all them who their thing only quotes holy Judicial System the judges the lawyers when he went back to Egypt you see people who take care of him he's here so much years later he familiar with all of them in a natural but in the Supernatural well that Spirit was over him he spoke as one having an authority he said more is that he said Pharaoh let my people go I have a word from the Lord he spoke as if he were God he said let my people go [Applause] a man who was playing card just a few years ago but look what God did see change how come Supernatural right it's a presence okay so the guy was saying hey he said you don't see always any logical possibility once ones accept the idea that there could be something outside of our natural he said then Miracles also become Possible Oh Hallelujah I'll say that again once one accepts once you are able to accept the idea that there could be something outside of our natural he said then Miracles also become Possible Oh hallelujah hallelujah so Miracles are not impossible once there is a God healing is not impossible once there is a God miracles

a little time left he knows that this is the last age you know that the devil is not stupid as people think the devil also believe and tremble but he's also angry because he wish he had what you had

missed God Peter couldn't even sign his own name and he had the keys to the kingdom of God given to him by Jesus Christ he said Prophet said we're looking to education he said education is fine that's taught in the school houses he said but church is the place oh and it ought to be the place tonight to know of God and to learn of God and in the Supernatural and he said God is the Supernatural is the same yesterday to them forever it's not right and he said no and we want to see and place this before the audience that that God still is the same that he ever was oh you have to have faith

faint he says he said but God covers all space all the time everywhere Prophet said he's omnipresent so he's everywhere and he always has been everywhere he always will be everywhere oh Hallelujah he covers all times in space there's times when he makes his presence known his active presence then he comes in then it comes in like the prophet says you you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him then he comes pray then his active presence he causes himself to become hallelujah praise God your healer your deliverer or the angel of God sent from the presence of God to do the work of God on the earth he sends his Angel behold I send my ninja to testify these things to the root churches I am the root on The Offspring of David I am the Brighton Morning Star worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and we've had the spirit of Prophecy for over 50 years on this message all prophesying Let There be there shall be there shall be but there's gonna come a time when all is natural it's gonna switch over to the supernatural when once more this world will hear direct from God oh oh and all we've been doing is just laying a short Foundation for a quick message show a quick message and I'll shake the whole nation oh honey you're just like a prophet said amen amen y'all was coming closer down what do you see amen all these things that take place isn't that right what we're doing is just laying a background for a shortcut message that'll shake the Nations what will it be natural no Supernatural got on the move he said I'll ride this Trail one more time oh

I'll ride this Trail one more time oh my glory all right let me get on here now hurry up time's going my let every man okay oh Hallelujah all right uh okay you got one please want to call there's the atmosphere right I'm going to get this part here now so that's the reason he said he said but it's the attitude of people that brings the results right he's he's everywhere so we said already he said he he's everywhere he's everywhere he's only present right but here what it is that is the attitude of the people that brings the results so he's there he's in the atmosphere he's all around but it's your attitude that brings him to the Forefront isn't that it's your attitude that brings him to the back bench wherever you are you could pull the Holy Spirit apart the Holy Holy uh pillar fire with your attitude with the right mental attitude in here tonight that will make the results happen the word of God must be mixed with faith or in order to achieve the chemical reaction praise God that we're looking for which is the supernatural in your midst it comes forth when the word is mixed with faith oh Hallelujah under that chemical reaction take place then it brings on the supernatural then the sicker here the blind see the Walk The Gospel is preaching his power praise God if you could only get the two together spread and Truth amen and amen hallelujah glory to God amen amen all right that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got in one place I'm going to call it see he said it's the atmosphere that brings the results you believe that he said let every man and woman in this building this morning and I say tonight boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus here and he said but I believe that he's standing present right now he said if you could get into that place isn't that right he said what do you tell the prophet he said he totally Prophet if he could get the people to believe he said not even cancer will stamp in your prayer if you could only get the people to believe oh how to raise their faith up to the point where they could believe God for everything and anything or not even cancer would stand in there in your way man is not right Mine He's a little remind woman but get everything from their minds and believe believe what that he's standing present right now he said and you will see something happening he said that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning oh that's right pray Express Guardian news they will be reporting the pillar virus took place in Sunny around here if you could just get every man every woman every child in the right atmosphere in the right mental attitude oh you want to take place he says that's right he said it's the atmosphere oh the presence of God his atmosphere is evidence of the supernatural amen isn't that right and it takes Faith to believe in the Supernatural it's not right not our thoughts not our emotions it's not right the only thing God ever gave to the supernatural the con uh the only thing God gave to the individual tonight to contact the Supernatural is faith that's what he gave Pastor contacted isn't that right he said Divine Healing and sanitation the powers of God he said watch this the prophet said is here it's a Divine Healing sanification and the powers of God is as long as your faith lasts in it wow and I believe just before that he was talking about how uh people come into a prayer line or they sit in the audience and the Holy Spirit is working and then he speaks to a certain person said you'll come here with a certain sickness and so on stand up receive a healing right and they get healed and then maybe a year later they get back in the same condition he said why is that he said because as long as your faith lasts in it praise God that's how long it'll last but if you're getting the wrong atmosphere the wrong things begin to happen it's not right Divine Healing sanification he says it's as long as your faith lasts in it he said when your faith fails then your experience is gone see he said it's it's based that way simply on the finished works of Christ at Calvary amen no wonder God told Peter I pray for you that Peter that your Faith Hill not oh and I thank God tonight that throughout all the years of faithful not of faithful not in this promised word or faithful not in this Bible We Believe to put the things that are written in this book father let the Firefall of faith is still standing on the promise word of God through every trial through every test through every Peril though this one fall away and that one Fall Away something within my soul oh God is holding on holding on holding on to faith in his promised word oh that's what brought us here tonight that's why we're still standing oh hallelujah it's according to you faith in you being tested and trying oh our time-tested oh Hallelujah that's what the bride gonna be in the last days amen and they believe that praise God oh my God oh my he stretches it out in time you love to do that just stretch time way out on it see what people are gonna do see what their attitude is going to be that's a real test it's easy to come and read a Bible easy to come and say God sent a prophet wonderful Prophet heal the sick raise the Dead all these great Miracles see too much fall off the necks of people and fall down on the ground and roll on their foot and all these kinds of things Maniac people get healed in the living and stuff like that it's easy to talk about that stuff but it's a different thing to hold on to the reins even though the storms are coming oh even though the storms are coming every stone I think keep thinking about brothers I go with message amen pray faith in the midst of your storm to every storm and trial that comes your way oh there's a faith in you that's got to stand a test because that's what's being tested amen amen I'm a bit of a cool hair

finish your work that he assaulted in you he's able to fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he's able to deliver your children he can deliver your children yes he can oh don't make the devil make you believe otherwise he can do it he's only testing your attitude to see if you are willing to go all the way does if you're willing to get in that water to get in that Prince Turing of the pool he wants to see if you'll come every Sunday everyone's day I believe I believe I believe I believe until one day you strike that Jordan and all that you're praying for all that you're hoping for will be

your system in your heart and your soul he will overwhelm you he will overcome your all every spirit there's nothing God can't do he's only been testing you all this time testing you're testing it see

Unseen World and with the supernatural oh you're walking on it you're talking with it oh Hallelujah my God he said no wonder people can't believe in those things he said it's because they never come in contact he said they've got nothing in there to believe it with he said but when the Holy Spirit oh come on comes into the hearts quickly he becomes a twofold being the prophet said one of the lips to die in his flesh and he said you become one in heaven to live a hallelujah oh no wonder Romans 7 Paul said I would I would I would not I find that there are two Spirits fighting within me but when we get over to Roman H he said there's then on there for now no condemnation the time that are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but who walk after the spirits the spirit of God will bear
