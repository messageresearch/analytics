the morning on Wednesday the 10th of April 2024 dad woke up healthy happy and in a pleasant mood overall he was very healthy very fit and had no underlying health issues later that afternoon he had spoken to a number of family members he had driven to London and came alone to the church to meet with a photographer as usual dad was working in his office and had some online meetings the photographer was surveying the building and left dad alone it is believed that Dad got up from his chair and had received an unknown form of internal trauma uh to um his body causing an instantaneous end of life as a life left his body he's collapsed without reaction all reflex suggesting an immediate halt to the brain a superficial cut was seen to the eyebrow and the nose causing a a bleed soon after the photographers located dad and called for help CPR was administered and an ambulance was called all attempts for restoration of Life were made without success the police have attended as a matter of procedure the detective sergeant in charge of the scene confirmed um to me and the family that there was no criminal element as there were no signs of a Breakin struggle or theft this has been verified by Witnesses and CCTV the police remained at the scene as per procedure to afford the family their privacy the peacefulness of Dad's appearance and the surroundings were restored ahead of the family seeing him all Brethren who came to show their respects remained outside uh where they prayed and sang brother Gerard um has prayed with the family prior um prior to the private ambulance his arrival the family are in contact with the coroner's office the family wish to express their gratitude for the well wishes and for respecting our privacy at this difficult time thank you the following statement is made on behalf of the family um Reverend Peter Chandler it is with great sadness we announce our beloved husband father and grandfather has been taken to Glory the suddenness of his passing has come as a great shock to us all he has left as he um as he was fit and healthy man with no known health conditions on the morning of the 10th of April 2024 he drove his wife and mother-in-law from Kent to London where he dropped them at his wife's sister's house in strattam he said goodbye to his wife and drove to the church to do several repairs and to meet a photographer coming to take pictures of the church at 2: p.m. he left the photographer to take pictures upstairs and went into his office several minutes later the photographer came down and found him collapsed on the floor a pass by was called in to assist and an ambulance was phoned and they came quickly accompanied by the police the presence of Emergency Services on the street alerted a neighbor who was able to identify him she called a member of the church who alerted his wife his wife called his phone and the ambulance crew informed her of the situation whilst they were trying to resuscitate him his wife arrived and the police allowed her to enter the church to identify her husband then asked her to leave as they were treating the scene as a su as suspicious until the forensic unit was satisfied that there was no suspicious circumstances his family arrived and were told of his passing the police then allowed only the immediate family access at the request of the family the police also granted access to a minister of the church to pray with the family we know his loss will be deeply felt by countless people worldwide whose lives have been touched during the 46 years of his ministry we feel comforted and blessed by the respect dedication and deep affection shown by the members of LCA during his life and now to our family during this period of mourning and change we are grateful for the respect shown towards our request for privacy while we we grieve the loss of a cherished Pastor loving husband much Lov father and grandfather God bless you the chantler [Music] family oh God bless you I don't have to introduce myself I'm sister Monica and I'm up here because as the prophet says when God call a man called his wife we were together from the beginning I'm his first convert he preached to me and 62 empty chairs and we both see everyone who came into the church so I think it's only fitting I know exactly what he would like and I just needed to express to everyone our make you comfortable about how I see things my husband when um brother cumi came here he preached twice a message about Redemption by marriage I couldn't understand why he preached that twice but when he preached it had never left me and that is my story Redemption by marriage hallu I was a young Pentecostal girl looking for the truth and almighty God brought him into my existence and he's become my pastor and my husband Hallelujah okay so for 46 years we've worked the whole of South London giving out tracks and Witnesses everything we are quite well known and we we we've seen a lot and we have served a old generation because we have been in this for over 40 years which complet a generation so let's go back my son and my daughter has told you about it for from my experience he my husband rose up in the morning he said I've got this appointment that appointment and I need to leave home at 10:00 I got my mom ready and we left the house I gave him a good breakfast he he has certain way how to eat I made him fruit salad just like he likes it and he made up his healthy cereal and I gave him a cook breakfast I say to him you need to heat well because you'll be there too long so we drove up happily the traffic was very calm and we arrive in stret him and he Pat me on the back see you later Pat my mom on the back say see you later mom and afterwards I was meant to join him here at church I was at um my sister's house when I got a call from a member of the church to say I don't know what's going on but I heard that brother Peter collaps I made it as quickly as possible to the church I came here and the whole road was blocked off with police and it was a crime scene anyway I came and know before that sorry if you can bear with me yeah yeah before that when the the the the member from the church called me and told me this and I'm I want to know something so I rang my husband's phone and then somebody picked it up and they said who are you and I told them who I am and they say to me oh I've got your husband here um he's collapsed but I'm afraid he's not responding to our treatment well as my background as a nurse I know those languages so when I came what I expected is what I've seen he was lying on the floor in the in in the lobby and they say to me come in I just want you to identify that he him and I want his date of birth and they wanted some question don't touch anything don't touch him so I came in and I looked I said yes and I gave them all the information and they asked me to get back outside and while I told my children what happened and they start to make their Journey here so we had to wait out there a very long time and then the deacons and few people start to arrive and we had to wait until they did their checks etc etc until they were very happy to let us in as a family and while we were there and everything we thought well the you know the the the minister because this is what is would be expected the minister is there and we need a closure we need prayer no let me go back my son and I did a lost office they allowed us to do a lost office and my husband to remove all his um watches and his valuables we could take that and we did a what we call a lost office to get him presentable to send him off then the rest of the family came in and joined us and they pay their respect to their dad then we asked um if the minister would come in and just pray with the family and they allowed it and they took my darling husband away when I came in and I saw him and I had him to myself I thought I won't be happy unless I test my fi Lord I don't know if it's your will but I am going to call him back in the name of Jesus Christ because he did not say goodbye to me so I called him back about three times and then I looked at his face and he had a look at I know him I know him when he's asleep I know him when he's tired and I looked at his face and I saw something beautiful when he is working on anything like he's because he's is's very good with his hands when he is working and something's really and he digs and he digs and that look when he managed to get it out or break that rock or if he's got a pleased look on his face face he looked you know and I looked at him and he's got his little nickname for me and I looked at him and what I've seen on his face was Pokey I made it that is exactly that is that is exactly that is exactly the look he had on his face when I saw that how could I call call him back I wish him back he's achieved something that's right you see so that is um that is my husband that is what happened on the day and I want to say a very very big thank you to LCA thank you for choosing LCA as your church and him as your pastor if I can just I know I'm taking time but I won't have this opportunity again so I am telling you he was genuine that's right a very genuine person my husband he was brought up in a privilege situation those of you from Zimbabwe might know the kind of life in prosperous Risha or Zimbabwe at the time he is never wanting for anything he grew up quite privileged what he's done here he's done it absolutely from his heart and he's done it from a calling he could have done anything he he is a humble man he's got more title than just pastor but you would never hear it you he'd never use them he kept them very private he wasn't you know he doesn't flaunt anything you wouldn't know it what you see is what he is and that is the honest truth he he W he weren't doing this for fame he wasn't doing this for popularity or for position it was a job to be done and he did it and that is how he is a lot of people did not understand him but in my little opinion you couldn't have gotten a better person than that who has got no other interest more than the kingdom of God and that was his interest that was him to a te it does not thirst for popularity he does not thirst for fashion or riches or anything like that yet you you know if that was what he working for he could have had it and he had it am but he kept real humble Hallelujah and that is why I'm very grateful and very thankful to almighty God for his ministry to me he is my pastor he was just going through job and explaining things for me it it it's just wonderful and where is my strength coming from the Lord and again I'll finish on this what made me able to come here today or stand here today was a message preached by precious brother Dill is also late Christ remain so my husband has flown with the Eagles but Christ remain God bless you the bridge let's all stand across the bridge there's no no more sorrow across the bridge there's no more [Music] pain the sun will shine across the [Music] river and we'll never be unhappy again oh across the r there's no more sorrow

there's no more pain my Lord the sun will shine across the river and we never be unhappy again sometimes I ask my wife wife I say is but Peter really gone you know something else we had so much a great time together and um he was a genuine genuine Son of God genuine person one thing I could say about about him all the years I've known him I've never heard him say one evil thing about anyone just like Brother zigma P BR just like brother Michael M never one I was telling about a brother who kind of Mischief maker always in people business always in churches business and brother Channel tell me he said busy he just said busy when I when I came home I tell my wife about it I said all he said was busy we don't talk that way he was a Class Act he was a classy person and I certainly would miss him greatly and so now we want to go into two messages he preached he preached a message about uh bride material uh bride material and he also preached as it is in heaven it's not long but

morning happy to have you here with us okay service continues this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. live here at the Tabernacle this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. we encourage you to make every effort if you could be here in the house of the Lord make every effort to be here on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. and certain ly if for some reason you cannot be here make sure that you are connected to the service so that you are part of what's Happening uh in this season also this coming Friday we have our Zoom prayer meeting at 800 p.m. make sure that you are present for our Zoom prayer meeting at 8:00 p.m. this coming Friday and of course this Sunday we are happy to be back in the house of the Lord to give worship and praise as we count down can the church say amen amen amen amen wonderful good to see you brother mvin God bless you happy to see brother mvin back he was out for a bit and we happy to have him back in the house of the Lord maintenance team uh group one please meet with brother popwell after the service and next week Lord willing group three is CED to serve and that's Brother Andy Henry's group so church we are on the countown we just about three months there abouts from the convention so it's all hands on deck in every way that you could support be it in your time your effort your financial resources your prayer your encouragement there's a lot of work to be done the word says the Harvest is plentiful the laborers are few so we really want to put our shoulders to the wheel in whatever way we can to create an environment and an atmosphere uh through our consecration our sanctification our dedication our financial support our physical support we appropriate so that we could prepare both this physical place and our hearts and the atmosphere uh because we know the minister could never bring the Revival it takes the people to create an environment that the minister can't even Minister because they are in a spirit of worship and expectation and they could pull from the angel so we want to encourage you for those who have made your pledges that you um continue to support that and those who have not yet made their pledges for the convention we encourage you to do so so that we could maximize what we're able to do for the upcoming convention both in terms of the Ministries that we'd like to be here as well as all of the other parts of the puzzle that need to come together for the whole picture to be complete so may the Lord richly bless you may the Lord continue to keep you during this season and I want to encourage you to practice the presence of the Lord so make it your business every single day to be in the presence so may the Lord richly bless you brother Anthony amen and amen you love the Lord today praise God let's get ready to leave amen as
