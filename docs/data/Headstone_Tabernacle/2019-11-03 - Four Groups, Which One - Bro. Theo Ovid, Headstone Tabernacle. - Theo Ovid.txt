and I know what Isaac and Ghana had a tremendous time also when it's time come he will share with you but we had a real tremendous time in Argentina I want to thank on Brunton II I didn't get to get a message for the last Sunday service true seed of the world last Sunday and I thought you were really blessed inspiration the Lord look upon the heart and in Argentina I have no words and the testimonies were so very encouraging just want to read maybe just two for you but it's you I want to give you my personal testimony of the meetings in Argentina I hope this message to my brother last night I could hardly sleep because I was meditating on the messages that Holy Spirit brought this weekend and certainly what is mature we have received power in our souls our understanding was open to see the world in the present tense and God wants us to take us deeper into revelation but God has placed in my heart that we should give the importance to life and the right spirit I my brother met the Lord and I will never be the same I believe it out a doubt that your ministry will be powerfully occupied in this last ride the Holy Spirit has focused me to stand firm on the world in these meetings we could see a channel flowing free of anointed and Commission interpretation I encourage you to move forward looking only to Jesus we must give the true importance to our Lord Jesus Christ I appreciate you much of a servant of Christ for the building of us as Hispanics I think I will see you very soon I'll be praying for a ministry the family the church but a Joshua from Chile [Music] and I get this testimony this week here and the chasm money without standing one of the Deacons that were standing by when you walk up to the pulpit on the last message he said as you pass by the presence of the Lord came upon him that his knees started to shake he was asking the Lord what was done but after the service he can't stop with disinterred people he has already won five souls for the kingdom oh praise the Lord amen amen [Music] well this morning we have a tip you like to put on before but before that I want to have a time of Prayer a small time of Prayer I felt that we after Friday permitting and all the time but a Stephen for hung in India for the permitting services requested Oh Stephen some real tremendous time on Friday we had a tremendous time in the Lord I was back on Tuesday but we are there for Friday permitting but this description read this from musica chapter 9 and Daniel I was understood by books a number of years where of the word of the Lord you see if you don't take time off to as I echo up here if you don't take time off to go into the world to look at what is happening know you miss the whole thing you live in a normal like eating drinking going to work coming back home like if nothing happening this day what not to take you wanna where's we spoke a message the day of the Lord everything God gives you and released into your life it's a civil matter let me say that gave me everything that God has given you and released into your life is just even better not to get further away from God but to get closer to God every single thing your husband your wife your children your family your job your money your time whatever it is God give you is to get closer to him [Music] the devil job is to get you further from God because the devil don't want you to come to perfection because a devil knew his time is short so he going on more like a roaring lion seeking a to get you trapped in the churchianity because I got bright material they chose spirit and you have to come and fight that and look to God look to the angel looked at the Spirit of God looked at the power of God look to you meeting God looking for your personal picture coming together burden Alleluia and the problem if people don't have a burden I put in for service I've been for the things of God a boon for the real Bible you have to get the burden I set my face on the Lord to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and support and ashes and I prayed on the Lord my God and made my confession and said O Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the covenant and mercy to them this is only had a pre and these are things yet to show you how to pray how to pray not just bring your own take Lord God and thing and you just go in your own Mary we because you

Z but unjust confusional faeces as of this day to the men of Judah heart of Jerusalem and all Israel that are near that are far off to all the countries where that I was driven them because they had trespassed they have trespass against don't trespass against God to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness do do we have rebelled against him neither have we obey the voice of the Lord our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets ye all Israel have transgressed thy law even by the pattern that they might not obey thy voice therefore the case is falling upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him he had confirm his words but he speak against us and against our judges that judges by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven had not been done as I've been done upon Jerusalem as written in the law of Moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God that we might turn for my iniquities and understand that truth dear for the Lord watched upon the evil brought it upon us for the Lord what is righteous in all his works but she will do it for your bid not his voice and now O Lord our God that was brought by people for out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and got me renowned as of this day we have sinned we have done wickedly Oh Lord according to all I righteousness I beseech thee let her hunger and I fear we turn away from thy city Jerusalem a holy mountain because of our sins and for the iniquities of fathers Jerusalem my people are become a reproach to all that about us now therefore O Lord God hear the prayer of thy servant on his supplication oh my oh my god incline thine ear in here opening I shall be whole our desolations on the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies O Lord hear all Lord forgive Oh Lord Hockman Duke defer not for their own sake o my god for a city and people have a call by name and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my god here while I was speaking in prayer even a man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about a time of the evil ablation and inform me and talk of me say no Daniel I am NOT comfort to give this skill and understanding at the beginning of ice application the commandment came forth and I have come to show thee for thy word greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision or praising in the Lord after Daniel had that burden a prayer oh my the Spirit came upon Daniel praise God to speak to Daniel to reveal things the Daniel you have to get into that spirit of Prayer you must want that spirit of prayer amen the tip that we have isn't long but I want to have a time a prayer a small time a prayer I just want it you should connect the body I believe that connect with what happened on Friday night cause something took place on Friday night oh praise it listen Oliver Graham says and remember at that great day of judgment your prayers will be counted just as much in that revival as my efforts would be to bring them there are people like free things everything free long-stem mentions may be your motive free free things yeah Calvary cost Jesus a revival cost there's a price for Brit truth there's a price to victory that is why character is not a gift it's a victory it's not so free so don't come philosopher no free ride don't look for anybody else to make the effort and you wait in the ride and jump in the anointing but you're praying you're not seeking God then that is why your will be able to take it with you in your know the Old Testament on the law when you pass through a cornfield you can pick off the corn is not your field if you're hungry you can pick and there's no sin to that no the court opinion last any but I said funny thing when the revivals begin to break out if you didn't put in you can't get it out you know oh you mean daddy issue with the foolish virgins that's right they didn't take the enough will to turn the spirit to be the extra oil in them because the world is spirit and life and the extra oil is what the wise virgin have received and when that would turn inside of you the fluids really could never get it because they never had it you have to have it inside of you because the rapture is not outside in raptures inside out cuttlefish Maxima compared to me somebody I will say again the rapture is not outside in it is inside out you have to have the laptop to go into the rapture come on give the Lord a show maybe another day that way before maybe let us see that where before but you have to have it in you because he not have it in him he couldn't even share it with

which one you belong which one you want to be in which auditing you're part of you would fill in the blanks for groups which one Daniel chapter 7 we want to reform for his name and I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame its wheels as burning fire fiery stream issued came forth from him thousand thousands ministered unto Him and ten thousands tank ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened much it up to 25 we read one to four and then we go down to his 31 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps went forth to meet the partner five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them but wise took oil in the lamps with their with their vessels with their lamps we go to verse 31 of that same chapter when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the tool of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats he shall set the sheep on his right hand the goats on the left then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked and he clothed me I was sick you visited me I was in prison you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty or give thee drink when so he a stranger and took me in and naked and clothed he or when saw he sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you and as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me then shall ye see unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels if I was hunger than you give me no meat I was to steal you gave me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked you clothed me not sick and in prison you visited me not then shall this answered and said Lord when saw we thee and hunger and a strange and naked sick o in prison did not minister the deep then shall he answered saying verily I sent to you in as much as you did it not to one of these least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous under life eternal our script final scripture Revelation chapter 13 verse 8 and all dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord I really wish I fishes on a Sunday I don't know why I'm purchase tonight but this really feels like a Sunday message this is not heavy but with but Branagh so this is a title for groups which one to be really identifying for groups so I want you to coffee huge masks you're not in headstone tabernacle take out your message mask yeah no message you're a believer take up holy religious mastic take it off and just come and see what they would say tonight and receive what it would see tonight so it's not groups it's not it's not churches there's not any message and I believe on a brand no is not that is what God said in this hour Jana remember the kingdom of heaven is like none to these virgins five were wise five were foolish which group you in the wise got oil the foolish did not get oil what in what group you want to be because some point two times somebody had to get people are get desperate you must want to know that they line up with the scriptures the people either say what side you're on what good hook you in what church you in this is not this is different a bit different now he said you know if we live in the land time is the age that the churches are going to come together and as even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the World Organization of Churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you would lose all now these are weighted words tonight they say you would lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the file manure of church orders will be physically bereft there will be presented to them a great temptation to give him preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give into the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy but the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment Day they will be found naked they will not be given microbes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in spotted garments of the world holding their hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up and hear the voice of God crying come out of her organization religion and my people that you be not partakers of her sins God is speaking son the religions of this world like a Sunday plague leave off walking with the world and make a garments white by repentance and the better than do it no for tomorrow might be too late Oh glory to God he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of the book of life hallelujah let's continue the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have nearly drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those born again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of the ribbet and if for any reason that may must be removed the space on the record will simply be blank as it was before a name will be placed there this is 100% opposite what the wood actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world after we pointed out shortly it's not a question of simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive it in a life where when one group received it and had their names placed on record and the others who refused it did not have their names replaced we will actually show by scripture that multi-tools were not even born again will point it in a life aha that's a big one multitude will go on that are not even born again and get eternal life always a big thing tonight this is not schemer tonight right we will also show that there's a group of people whose me haven't been placed on that record before the phone in the world cannot under any circumstances have those name removed and we will also show that another group whose names are on that record before the foundation of the world will have their name removed to begin with there's no basis for the claim that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the Lance book of life or Christ book of life or even died book or the book of the living only names are written on it and the scripture he says quote revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 20:12 2:15 I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll but delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to works and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death many people don't even know there's a second death the first that is easy but every man that has died will be resurrected to be judged Oh hallelujah oh yeah tango tonight for the blood you thank God for Jesus pin and accept in your judgment and my judgment and take upon himself dying on the cross that we could go free tonight that's why you should worship Him that's why you should give Him praise that's why you should never come in the hopes of God with herself but the frong with any bad attitude or glory to God hallelujah you can see that door there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book container names it has caused the Lamb book of life or the book of life then where is this book located scripture looks ten seventeen to twenty four hundred centimeters with Joyce in Lord even the Devils are subject unto us should I name he selling them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding and this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your name are written in heaven or glory the Gordon that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that I was hid these things from the wise and the prudent and as we filled them unto babes such as well Alleluia even so father it seemed good in thy sight or give the Lord a shout hallelujah so this book of life is located in heaven and will appear the white throne judgment in these verses jesus said the names were written in heaven they were written in the book don't rejoice because they were subject unto you but rejoice because your name is in heaven that's why if you know your name is in heaven if you know your name as written every survey should be rejoicing just to have the opportunity do not worship in the beasts you're not worshipping some false prophet you're not worship in this world system or give the Lord a shout no wonder he said random seven thunders come forth then you'll be worshiping the Living Christ you're moving in and out among us but are we are fighting for every promise that God promised in this hour all glory to God amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God praise God no notice hallelujah Childress was one of those who were cast no Devils in Jesus name and we know that he was a devil son of perdition and Jesus said he that watcheth need not wash his feet but it's clean every whit but you are crema not all but you who would betray him therefore he said you another were clean I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen and the study scripture might be fulfilled these are it had bread with me I lifted up his heel him against me now if language means anything we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet he was not clean Oh glory to God hallelujah Judas was also given to Jesus by the father hallelujah notice that given is the exact parallel as the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau the east on Pharaoh a buzz for known they were predestinated a rat portable repres hallelujah and elect even to them but stumble at the word being disobedient Judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a pact with them in the ministry previous the Pentecost or glory to God so those sites on a ministry site to being a bride come on give the Lord a show get the Lord on show this everybody should be caught up about that go faithful ministry try to be prophetess bride [Applause] because we're the Ancient of Days haul em closers ten thousand thousand like the bride Oh glory to God with the demon forget the loss now Jesus and his bride or glory that God let's continue my acts 117 men on bridge in descriptor much-needed fulfill wish the Holy One by the motor of the image speak and he was numbered with us and an obtained part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained among the twelve and then lost was neither inferior to the ministry of the other level no was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected among the ministry of the others so he was anointed and commissioned okay the Lord I shall do you feel like moving on tonight that he may take part in this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas had ever lost a court given Holy Ghost ministry and kill themselves and went his own place his name was even in the book of life his name was blotted out there are four groups or glory the God you have to be identified with one you have to be connected at one there's a word pride that is wise version or glory to God as the foolish virgins second resurrection for that there are the people that are good that will get it to the life at the white throne judgment or glory to God and there are those names who was never in the book okay the Lord a show or glory that caught you have to belong to one or Gore either gotta make your name is on that book he an opportunity yes even letter put it in tonight that name was put there I will get a lot of soap before the foundation of the world before you had a problem before a condition before your felon soon before your fail but remember you all right to shout y'all all right to sing the praise your God hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah hallelujah The Seagull up there dead I saw the dead small and great stand before God think about it on my you unholy gongs tonight you are privileged tonight all them people who never stand a chance some of them gone some of them wish they could reboot and kick and get out the hell and sit in church to say give me one more chance just one more chance give me another chance [Applause] just continue there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment these righteous will not be the bride for the bride system and judgment stop rewind but over the mean the bride will be part of the judgment yes he have a scripted faith first corinthians 6:2 two and three do you know the scenes adjust the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that you shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life mother scripture relation 321 table overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame an Isetta what my father is strong see the bride is written in and strong and she is to judge the world she wants to be sitting in judgment that's what Daniel saw or glory to God hallelujah and he caught descriptively red I beheld until the trauma cast down and the angels of these did sit whose garment was white as snow or glory to God hallelujah so you are a big statement to make now only the bride alone qualifies for the first resurrection or glory of God bless her that day that comfort in the first resurrection only the bride all the bride electors go along in the ground they come into the first resurrection everybody has have to wait for the second resurrection but there's to be a little bride coming forth in the first resurrection all glory to God on you asleep okay the Lord a show he's not excited tonight is another exciting tonight there is going to be a resurrection oh Lord I want to be in that number when the saints call my champion or give the Lord a shout when the saints go marching in hallelujah hallelujah was continued the question now arises why are these righteous ones in judgment there is no other place they can come in but they are not - they are just for two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come in the second resurrection on the judgment so the second resurrection is a resurrection of the judgment not the first one because the bride already judged in Christ Jesus the bride will not be judged the bride cannot be judge she will be with the judge okay the Lord a shout is justified did you hear that the bride is justified as if she never did it in the first place hallelujah study Muslim beliefs and resurrection the ones who qualify for the first resurrection is the bride and I'm not in judgment and he could have scripted for at the back that up change and 524 fairy lights unto you he that heareth my voice i believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life which is I believe a recipient of eternal life he is a possession of it right now and shall not come into judgment hallelujah but is passed from death unto life so Jesus must have yet another in mind a certain resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at that resurrection not having previously as a member of the bride and to prove that he ever scripture for that John 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is coming this is Jesus in which all data in the graves shall hear his voice all all and shall come forth neither have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation but all putting it at voice and to thankful to God tonight that you hearing the voice of God in the last days or glories of God you hear in his voice no you hear in a word of the Spirit no God speaking to you no because the electrons the ability to hear from Cork give the Lord a shout you I see you have the ability here from God or plural of God you are hearing from God tonight because God is the word unless you hear the word and receive the way again from God that's the ability like what put in the lake Alleluia we all know that John 5:20 that 29 is not the rapture I just have to be just read for only the dead in Christ shall arise on the graves at the time along with the Living bride who still sits on the earth let's read back the script that we just read Marvel not that this for the always coming which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come for deal of good on the resurrection of life till have done evil unto the resident damnation that's not a rupture the know the rapture the rapture is 1st Thessalonians 4 for the Lord Himself shuts in for me with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we wish our life and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air Oh hallelujah Amen hallelujah let me get a shot again because you wanna be caught up to meet him you are gonna be changed in a moment and I I believe that I'm gonna preach that oh praise God praise God hallelujah you may be seated we now face the question as to why this should be given eternal life at the judgment since the epistles seen the conclusively point out that one must possess the Spirit of Christ or perish though it seemed us we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly says forth that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general direction or after it Paul does not evade this truth for it clearly says in Philippians 3 level it by any means I might attain the resurrection of the dead now this statement is very peculiar we all know and we are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so Paul could hardly be seen if by any means I might attain a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he's not seeing that the literal realness if by any means I might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the opinion to the general or several second resurrection but attend to the first resurrection and which he said blessed and holy is he who had part in the first resurrection on such the second death no power or glory to God hallelujah praise God don't you feel inspired tonight all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God let's continue he said no but they should I be like priests of God and Christ shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of a thousand years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forward to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death no we do not need to guess about those who were in the second resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they are being kind and good to the Brethren this is something worthwhile noting a long time I've heard this but this is sometimes something with Van Noten we are told it is given to them underground they have been kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast a lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the bedroom or test the Lord I show which group are you in which group you will because um everybody's gonna be in a group everybody gets on a group Oh give the Lord a shout if you never heard that before just having it now Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah since this is the word of the Lord we simply accepted there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact we read the scripture when Jesus fasted eternal life he said when I was hungry you feed me when I was naked they clawed me and they said but when we do that he said when you do did little to little Lisa them you tease it on to me Oh hallelujah or glory to God hallelujah praise God the rest was the direct opposite let's continue the further clarify notice specifically go on I like that porn the words as Matthew 25:31 246 which is what we read it does not see that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time why turn judgment the sheep are already in his fold they heard his voice they followed him they already have eternal life and he are not come into judgment but these do not have eternal life they are in judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds to the enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have this life as does the bride but they receive it because it was time to his brethren they are not his brethren that will make them join us with Jesus they are not asking anything but life they share not role except over him their names must have been in the book of life are not removed but because of the love of the people of God they are recognized and saved oh man so no you know who you are I know you know people gonna treat you based upon who you are I will be saved and receive eternal life because of who you are okay the Lord a shout it's the death know who you ask you better know who you are tonight Oh glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ okay the Lord I show scallywags in her somewhere he put your name on the book he said mark I thought to call you out [Applause] let's continue because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and save no doubt these save that help the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in a time of trouble it's this seem smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked and not restored but tuned into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed within the book of life also but they were blotted out because they fail to honor the people of God who are the Living manifested word living epistle for their day oh you mean the bride could be the living manifested blood for this day your meal is that walking wrong with a book and escape and say what you believe but it has to be the winner living in the individual or give the Lord a shout seven living voices my god I believe that you know or you have to accept the other group if you don't want to accept that you have to become the Word made flesh then you have to find the next group you never said I know my group keeps spinning and see if you find a group it's only four it's not 24 you know just for so you could pick which one that's what they want I like that so which one now let's be clear here these are not Nations being judged and going to the Millennium because they have habit and at the Jews this is very clear because of the conclusion of these verses that these the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment but the righteous into everlasting life there is no record of two judgments set whether we get a cast on a lake of fire only the beast and the false prophet at the judge at the end of the Great Tribulation this is the white throne judgment and they are judged according to what's written in the book in the second recollection that's the souls under the altar that's in the fifth seal them coming second resurrection the carbonyl Lord voice how long Lord how long does not judge and avenge our blood these Jews under this altar we know that note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not like Antipas who were slain for holiness fascist name these are not born again one but it's in life as their possession they come in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying for vengeance they cannot be bright material that speaks volume nail them Jewish Canon for vengeance he said Tecna back material so any person in this message sign of a vengeance you know we're on it you know who being right they're not in this bright group because the bride don't call for vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repair the break Oh contact the bride will turn the other cheek give the Lord a show [Applause] [Music] the bright the bright turn-the-other-cheek they have to because they are they have to watch so these Jews aren't born of the Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is Messiah but they were blinded by God for the Gentiles seek God gives them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him they were truly faithful to all the world the new and died under Stalin and Hitler and yet they will die it is the second resurrection where in the five foolish virgins to come up oh my goodness this five foolish virgin immunization they not denomination let's continue they they did not have the Holy Spirit so they miss being the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being separated God loving people trying to abide in the world according to what they knew of it and I help in the work of the Lord will come at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is more important and wonderful than we ever taught I believe though that they here at this all I want to miss it that cumulative a big banking downstairs and you go at home to drink water and tom says have all seven course menu layout here and you go in to drink water tribulation and water and a thesis dear it have a wedding supper you know and a millennium honeymoon this is more wonderful he said then we could think or imagine you don't want to miss it which group pool in there or give the Lord a shot in the house hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid that's an alligator glory to God you could imagine no when you hit that scripture his wife a kid is that ready when you come into the church nobody could touch you no more because you in our atmosphere all by yourself because you know who your husband is you know who you worship your know by your worship oh my let's continue Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all these people are their names in the book of life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be tools whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire so let's go to another step he said let's review our case thus far let's review these four groups one first of all we know assuredly that the purpose of God stands in the election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to prefer to people like unto himself that would be a word bright so that break a missive for nothing because God purpose it that is God intent to have a word bright no Bishop could stop it no conjugal stop it no Prime Minister no president no message Pope or Roman Pope it has both hallelujah not only Pope's any message or alter the message could stop this world present coming for no false anointed no unintuitive hello we are not dead preacher nor denying preacher nothing gonna stop this bride or I feel good tonight God's war he's far by himself seven thunders trottle voices oh go get that bride [Applause] going to break the silence over your life like he broke the Silence of the seventh seal or glory to God Amen let's continue hallelujah she was chosen this bride before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth to many ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and he had never come in to come right all day here just now if I continue so I will cast a problem I won't be able to continue preaching this thing this thing's sweet tonight did you hear what he just said here did you hear that or give the Lord a shout he hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit is speaking tonight he said she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her like singing no no I feel like dancing hallelujah where's the scripture for that Romans for it blessed is the man to whom God the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of our members was written in the search of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's group number one that's you that's the word right Rosamond him before the song in the world before your smoke your first cigarette before you tell your first life before you commit adultery and fornication before your backside before all that put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life or get the Lord a show that's why I found you just so I could find you're not bad in a rum shop anybody could find you the cure what's the truth living before much man and what that I not that you wouldn't see any see don't wanna be wealthy he passed in some area he's no her name is on the book he had to call she out and Annie fine huh he sent his disciples away I'm waiting for that woman or glory she I even know she is being waited on she's waiting

though when I leave the phone this review and the morning satsang together and the sons of God destroy that's that group that's nothing shouted for joy hallelujah gonna be ceases hallelujah let's look at the second group another class their names were also in the book of life but they will comp in the second resurrection such as the foolish virgins and the righteous are spoken much 25 in this class those who do not worship of beasts or become involve an antichrist system but die for their faith even though they're not not in the bride Oh hallelujah Oh God having been born again they will come in the second resurrection unto eternal life thirdly there are the borderline Christians such that we saw Israel's Coronel Egypt these had their names in the book of life and their works written in the books these haven't failed to obey God being void of the Spirit - even the signs and wonders among them will have their names removed from the book of life among them could you find us entirely void of the Spirit religious will have manifestation in their lives although the books were not elected in him such as Balaam will be in that group and the fort will be finally boys whose things have never been or never will ever be written in the book or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory to God thank you Jesus hallelujah oh my let's hit the home stretch now you did very well I'm amazed how we get you here Oh glory to God you can imagine written this without the anointing Oh dry and like Crick's biscuit you have to take it on try and put some water behind it but when the Shekinah is upon this wall where this will just come alive so smooth it will take a teacher for hours to preach what we appreciate about 45 minutes I'm telling you with audio 19 various hallelujah hallelujah we will perish without this anointing can make the anointing make the difference the anointed press the yoke the Spirit is just a big revelation for you which group hallelujah hallelujah so all the more awesome crutches we'll keep using in hallelujah praise God God forgive them and didn't want to forgive nobody which single group of God said if you can't forgive neither will I forgive you or glory they go Daniel to choose I'm going on next group well get the Lord a shout but the bride will be like Jesus when he was under closes and Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they know not what they do that's the bride or give the Lord a shout because it is based on forgiveness [Applause] somebody must be wrong hallelujah maybe she said a little but the bride could handle wrong because you're once wrong to say somebody wrong you you could forgive them I don't know what to do to you you have to forgive them if you are part of this bride you have to be able to say I forgive you okay the Lord I showed them let it go let it go [Applause] [Music] it's either be below zero but they are not being tested you are doctors from a sauna maybe season they are not a bride you know the body bridesmaid right assistance bright healthy garment and not so it or know where it is but bride is from saying I do or give the Lord a shout you have fallen into pillow bridesmaid in this thing you know this is bride and groom stuff or glory energy also called the middle bridesmaid he's going to be part of this bride I'm the spirit and the bride say come if I said Brian bridesmaid

frustrate to do but just passed my plantains in the Pops book the coconut booboo and porn and quarter and Jesus say yeah I think seen how thick it with all rock so taking a dry street taking it Street my name Jesus Rena of course not but Jesus well you could do that not you real Jesus that I my name by Jesus Oh hallelujah maybe by Jesus mother Jesus Oh hallelujah praise God so his ping it let's continue let's continue sis took to good hallelujah yes a little more since this portion of the word is hard for the human matter grass all this profit is good oh my goodness is this this is good it must be accepted and believed by feet some will be offended by what I have set forth because they fail to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is God and because He is God one cannot defeat his concerts or thwart his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all our fears and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore Paul said if God should take one lump of P and make that seem love one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonour who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do on the crumbs of creation alone we cannot deny yet he went even further according to Roman's 14 sin 9 we have the irrefutable proof that Jesus paid the purchase price of the whole world therefore you can do as you will with his own hallelujah and none of us liveth to himself Norman died himself but whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's okay the Lord I show you are being purchased you are being bought with a price do you get that tonight you are not your own he paid for you listen listen when the angel crowd who is worthy who is worthy and no man was from worthy and the landscape thawed bloody bleeding he said I died for them I come for the book I pay the price I come to bring back this inheritance from the earth from my wife all glory of God you don't like a show tonight I can't restaurant tonight I can't worship tonight when the lamp broke the book no wonder John says all in heaven on the earth [Applause] Oh glory to God hallelujah we have enough crazy Wednesday night service tonight Oh Gloria tell somebody about it so listen is that this M Christ both died and rose and revived but he might be the Lord pour out the dead and the living yes yes revolution yeah he said ownership not relationship is meant Ian he is Lord over the river and the dead not relationship relationship with his bride but ownership over all that's all any speak every man-jack coming up all go be raised from the dead to be judged what proof I will be in or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost done the quote Ephesians that's in the dispensation of the fullness of times he by Kara together in one all things in Christ both which have done even him in whom we are obtained inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will thus if God so designed that there are those whose names are pleased in the section of the book of life that cannot be raised for the other names of his bride then we must accept it also states that there are those whose names are placed in the record but in the foreknowledge of God they were to fail and have those name removed we must accept that and if there are those who name up there was those whole names with never placed on the record we must accept that also Oh hallelujah or glory dub God my God my God let's continue to understand this subject raise a cup of it even more clearly it will be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages remember sometime I'll talk about conversion and people do want to convert and digest again things literally if you go to Mexico you can't use TT dollars the other converted to pieces so if you want to build the house the materials called building materials but around call them virtues building materials if you want to go into the King's presence they become steps you're not building material on meet the king you have seven steps to go up to the king because he's only seven step isn't that right if you want to see to the edges you need eyes so all of a sudden you have seven eyes everyone changes here one seven horns so is the currency of the conversion to what effect that you want now you can't preach spirit to preach the world and it would tell in the spirit now there are three Bibles the zodiac this physical Bible in the pyramid but you're capricious Oriya you can't preach pyramid but you can preach it with and if this will come into you you have the pyramidal you you have to Bible or glory love God so brother Branham taking the book of life now and he bringing a different reference on a point to bring clarity for all what I said of these four groups are you ready just a little more again another finish let's go that's what yeah what is he now to understand this now we want to consider not even Fisher now but the groups represented in the church to do this we would like the church through the ages told plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself to a certain process and during a certain period of time that single seed will die and in time the light that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or they carry of that life which is to come back to originality and multiplied form Jesus the great warrior see he died the massless one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church of all seven Church ages given his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end that this very life will be repetition bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is active resurrection that the Royall seed will see many royal seas that contain self so this is not really it the real glory will be ready at the resurrection where we shall see him like he is and we shall be like him okay the Lord I show this miserable fresh body I like him but in that resurrection we are going to be like him or give the Lord a shout glory to God this man put on immortality this corruption put on interruption and be a change or glory of God let's continue we shall be like him no that is what John the Baptist was referring to that Jesus will gather the wheat into his gonna that was the resurrection where the reteamed who had been elected to life came in know the record of this wheat plant here we go whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multi-platform is the book of life so he is converting it be holy plant gijin are you getting it is the book of life are you with me I repeat the history all record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a path of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is conventionally seen by examining the wheat plant a seed is sown sunna play the scene that is not to eat yet it grows into a stalk that is not a week yet life is dear but not to eat then at the end of the stalk is a little spike that's another tassel still our wheat plant but no bit yet then the plant is pollen eyes we see the child grow it looks mighty and the wheat but has not yet seed then forms a wheat in the husk it is now back to what is all originally know the ripen wheat is harvested Jesus died almost finish to bear with me and anybody sleeping just gave a big shock there's just no sleeping right now we're almost done all right so Jesus Christ died he give his life that life was to come back upon the church here we go and bring many sons like unto himself unto the glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed have to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied with seed even so it had to be a church which would be a carrier of the life of Christ the blade stop tassel husk were the carriers for the seed but not to see the self so the church cooperate truly ages have been at area of the true seed told not to see the self that is why we can say the book of life is the whole wheat plant or just a lot of show till you catch it tonight let's go over it again here is the original seed that was planted it produces a bleed that wasn't it if it is a store not at either he had come husk we to form the tassel appears then the pollen falls on something on those pistols part of that plant is quickened something of the original seed came to the rest of the plant turns in the seed why didn't the whole pan go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because that path of the wheat plant is eternal life wheat do you see it all the other processes carriers but that part of come back to eat is the original grill that's the bad old Chloe don't cut he sent the Prophet the timer's back original faith the original seed the original light all let's finish off you know all glory to God he said you have a perfect type Israel even Egypt they came out two million strong all escaped the sacrificial blood all about ties on the Red Sea all came out of the water and join holy Smith manifestations all angel food all drunk of the rock yeah except for few they were not but carriers all Israel is not Israel all but a tiny minority and their names are blotted out of the book of life we have the same thing right in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blood another book of the eternal life for that is another record that contained in the book this is the record God had given us eternal life and that life is in his son he's hot the Sun hot the life oh my god breaking you could come oh my you're being a tremendous audience tonight you applaud my mind I thought this might be too much for tonight but praise God praise God praise God hallelujah in concluding in concluding this for this time let me put the statement that I made in the beginning when I said that not one scripture spoke of the Lord presently compiling a record of names that is indeed so Oh hallelujah oh my talk about a roll call he said the rapture is not the only roll call the rapture will be a roll call Oh glory to God I waitin to hear that voice Oh glory when he speaks you can take their advice or glory no good be shocked about Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God a man or my mind my mind the rapture is not the only world called there's a second resurrection of the white throne judgment will namesti confess before the fallen angels and I've been told by those who know that the sweetest song to a human ear is the song of that person's name how people love to have their names before the public how they love a clean but no earthly voice will ever strong your name as sweetly as well the voice of God if your name is in the book of life and remains there to be revealed before these holy angels what a day that will be when we are Jesus a father they confess my name before men in the days of the earthly pilgrimage no I will confess their names before thee and all the heavenly angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches once more the Spirit has spoken once again we have reviewed a record of what the Spirit set another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by it must fulfill exactly as he said it would be what a consolation that is to us who hope to be in the last day bright for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform every promise if he was faithful and true the toes in his audition age then he will be just as true now age if they're by His grace and power will receive the commandment by him so will we let us go therefore to perfection and meet the Lord in the air and we forever be with him let's all stand and worship the Lord tonight [Music] I am I see that I can have my say Oh [Music] my face [Music] I've been here Martin Oh Oh take my clothes and follow [Music] oh Jesus where he leaves me good far well he beats me for well Meah if I alone with him or

em you want what - sweetheart tonight speak that you could walk right speak I think a top right that you could live right oh yes low speaking I'll answer law send me oh my oh my oh my poor glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah just one last thing lighter read he said Jesus Christ was planted he died that the life that was in him came up to the wheat plant on his rep reducing itself in modules of wheat seeds listen having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit the origin not by letter Bella class but by spirit so it has to come back to them 7 proof
