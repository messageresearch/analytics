[28:36] there which is your personal faith or
[28:39] glowing of God the resurrection feet and
[28:42] that feet have to be on the earth and

[29:30] the acceptability of the Lord and that

[29:51] do you believe that - Oh glory to God
[29:53] hallelujah so tonight I'm going forward
[29:59] and preaching we be doing some
[30:01] reflection on the Azusa revival that
[30:04] came in the Azusa Street 1906 we'll be
[30:07] looking back again and summarize what
[30:09] happened back there because something
[30:10] supernatural happened back there and God
[30:12] brought the atmosphere before he sent
[30:14] the Prophet he made the atmosphere
[30:15] trouble 1906 become profit was coming
[30:18] and I probably have to bring the world
[30:20] in the atmosphere and the Pentecostal
[30:22] revival the Brico back you know 6 it was
[30:24] God sent it must call ordained it was
[30:27] got inspired and up to know it
[30:29] influenced the entire world
[30:30] Oh glorious God and God took one man can
[30:33] use that man in such a mighty away Oh
[30:35] glory they've all gone using for looking
[30:37] for many that he could use in a mighty
[30:39] way Oh glory to God so when God called
[30:42] him out he provided my lamb he provided
[30:45] a manna from heaven he provided a rock
[30:47] to drink from they were thirsty
[30:48] he provided a brass serpent to heal them
[30:51] when I was sick I would all an act and I
[30:54] never even discovered I know discover
[30:55] something they wanted a theological
[30:57] experience I never realized the ology
[31:00] could give them experience Oh hallelujah
[31:02] jail of a theological experience another
[31:05] Holy Ghost experience
[31:06] a geologic experience is an intellectual
[31:08] experience whoa girl when your mind gets
[31:11] stimulated go glory that God the Holy
[31:13] Ghost experience is your destiny little
[31:15] more glory to God so watch they wanted a
[31:19] theological experience so they could
[31:21] have something to fuss and organize and
[31:23] break themselves up so this is what the
[31:25] teal as she does I better than Hugh
[31:27] Amerasian and you I see in industry you

[42:05] speaking in other tongues equipment
[42:07] power who was all over them it was
[42:10] equipment power they were saturated with

[42:49] tonight my Jesus
[42:52] but about say whether we make our
[42:54] mistake like Israel did we couldn't get
[42:58] along going away the Holy Spirit was
[43:00] leading us we have to add something to
[43:03] cause unbelief to comment if Israel
[43:06] would have went ahead following the way
[43:08] the Lord was leading within two weeks
[43:10] they had been in the promised land two
[43:14] weeks ten to forty years
[43:17] they almost did
[43:18] just two weeks and the in the land and
[43:22] because unbelief came in God sender
[43:25] forty years not only seven forty years
[43:27] you know judge them that they're not
[43:29] going to hear it and the people that
[43:31] came out going on 100 you're winning on
[43:33] your children not you God put judgment
[43:38] on a whole generation and say your seed
[43:41] have to use what go cross wrong not one
[43:44] of you to learn Mexico I say the same
[43:46] God that brought two million people of
[43:49] the symbol that church them I told a
[43:51] Mexico his sink or the pink note in this
[43:53] mess if you touch this message seemed
[43:55] quarter this message not a different one
[43:57] hello the same one another different one
[44:00] on the bring my mother Egypt and he
[44:02] touched them and when Jesus came on the
[44:05] scene they said our fathers if my
[44:06] levelness Jesus still live and dear
[44:09] everyone dead and that dead means
[44:13] separated from God somebody sent me a
[44:20] quote about people ministers and
[44:22] different not even saved not even saved
[44:27] nice people good people not even saved
[44:32] they come into church I come with the
[44:35] church I come to church this is the
[44:38] calling of God this is the election of
[44:42] God the predestination of God the hearts
[44:46] has subdued something and if the
[44:47] Pentecostal church would have move on in
[44:49] the spirit the way God or dealing to go
[44:51] and had already proved that he was in it
[44:53] we work we would have been living in the
[44:55] Millennium
[44:56] and he said the Bible Corinthians says
[44:59] these things happen for in examples
[45:01] whom the end of the wolves are coming
[45:03] now we could learn from these guys learn
[45:06] from their failures mean from the
[45:08] attitudes leans on the arrogance and
[45:10] pride that we don't follow their way
[45:11] then that's what we here for to learn
[45:15] from them that we don't do what they do
[45:17] because God touch them what happened to
[45:22] this group we couldn't go on being led
[45:25] by the spirit in a group of believers we
[45:26] have to have something to talk a name
[45:27] unto us we wanted to make an
[45:29] organization they have formed and made
[45:31] it somebody got a revelation that
[45:32] somebody only baptized any man Jesus
[45:34] Christ in Jesus instead a family goes
[45:37] what happened they make an organization
[45:38] called a pee-pee JC and different ones
[45:42] one coming on a horse one coming on a
[45:44] cloud and that's where you make your
[45:45] mistake that is where you're horribly
[45:47] sin why didn't you leave it alone if
[45:51] that's named Jesus and all the things

[50:43] pour out your spirit upon you the
[50:46] progress that no church could hold the
[50:47] Holy Ghost but individuals or catalana
[50:50] show individuals that all individuals
[50:57] can hold the Holy Ghost you can feel it
[51:02] you could have it you can receive it it
[51:05] could come into you that's your promise
[51:11] you won't have somebody that half PhD we
[51:15] have some of these great titles and so
[51:17] forth to make us somebody to look up to
[51:19] now the rest of the presidency where
[51:21] they fuss and fighters chew out of the
[51:24] corner of the feather of the hat it's a
[51:25] disgrace it brings unbelief the Bible
[51:27] said and butter brown I'm going back to
[51:29] the wood now watch how it goes to the
[51:30] Scriptures the Bible says how can you
[51:33] have feet when you are regards one to
[51:35] another how can you do it when you try
[51:38] to say that this trip man is in we have
[51:40] to listen to him the bishop is in we
[51:43] have to listen to him the first picture
[51:46] is in we have to listen to him trying to
[51:49] be somebody in your organization you
[51:51] can't do it and have faith in God
[51:53] because they have to look down man let's
[51:55] look for some kind of headquarters but
[51:57] when you're connected to this power
[51:58] source of the Holy Ghost you have to
[52:01] look down on man you're looking to the
[52:03] leadership of the Spirit because the
[52:05] spirit is sent to guide said the Spirit
[52:08] of Truth won't leave you
[52:11] and gave you into all truth particular
[52:16] Asha it's not the spread of air it's the
[52:21] spirit of truth it was released it was
[52:24] sent to guide you into all truth
[52:27] all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[52:32] my mom said I often made this remark I
[52:34] find out two classes of people in the
[52:36] world
[52:37] that's Pentecostal for one unfunded
[52:39] mental think about just to the
[52:44] fundamental people positionally know
[52:46] what they are in Christ by the promise
[52:50] of the Bible but they haven't received
[52:53] the Holy Ghost to know to have faith
[52:58] so they have acknowledged the
[53:00] information that it consciousness but
[53:03] not the faith
[53:06] now we take faith to produce an
[53:08] atmosphere because take fate our
[53:10] expectation when will reveal the Simeon
[53:13] given an expectation he's old man they
[53:16] say if he slip under fixed in a fallen
[53:19] grief I just making an expression here
[53:21] he has there already but God revealed to
[53:23] him you shall not see death until you
[53:25] see the Christ so you can tell about God
[53:28] I could almost hear let me go and buy a
[53:31] coffin for you you can see we won't see
[53:34] me and not enough
[53:35] see man I get an frightened Grim Reaper
[53:38] didn't wink I hope my buddy hope scholar
[53:41] whatever it is he has nothing to do with
[53:42] that because God told him you shall not
[53:46] see death so he pushing that aside until
[53:49] I see the Christ I can't even talk to me
[53:51] that I even come near me until I see the
[53:54] Kranks he could swim through that he
[53:56] could cross over that he could jump over
[53:58] that because God said you have to see
[54:01] the Christ and every day going to the
[54:03] temple waiting on the same Holy Ghost
[54:06] that came upon him that revealed after
[54:10] him until in the expectation when Mary
[54:11] passed the Holy Spirit
[54:17] so that's the one I see one that's the
[55:07] one
[55:08] spirits talking right there Mary is
[55:10] there and to confirm it is right blind
[55:12] manner she can't see nobody no he see
[55:14] that you spirit leave him come on did
[55:16] the Lord of song visit this for sure is
[55:17] called a blind woman she's coming
[55:19] through she's brain and she stopped
[55:20] right binary God could lead a plane
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:28] oh my god I feel inspired tonight
[55:32] Oh bloggers will be talking about going
[55:34] to lead a blind woman keep her promise
[55:36] on the hour
[55:37] did you know what I said coralina blind
[55:40] person to the promise of the Messiah
[55:43] will come suddenly to his temple what if
[55:46] he comes tonight one of the Holy Ones
[55:47] come to you tonight be ready to be
[55:57] fundamental nor the promise of who they
[56:00] are but if I receive the Holy Ghost to
[56:03] have faith the Pentecost our people
[56:06] receive the Holy Ghost but it renewed
[56:08] yeah so like a man got money in the bank
[56:11] and don't know how to write a check any
[56:13] other one could write a check and hasn't
[56:14] got no money Demark if you could get you
[56:19] two together money and signature then
[56:22] you can withdraw Oh hallelujah
[56:26] so then let's continue if the
[56:29] Pentecostal people could settle
[56:31] themselves I said last night I actually
[56:33] believe with all my heart the
[56:35] Pentecostal church was in a better
[56:37] condition in those days you all's
[56:40] retreat meetings that you speak of so
[56:42] much I've read books of the early
[56:44] Pentecostal church 30 40 bucks years was
[56:46] in better condition for the common of
[56:48] the Lord than right now they rarely was
[56:51] right down to good Christians they lived
[56:54] it and they believed it they lived it
[56:59] and believe that we don't have the
[57:03] old-time Pentecostal that used to die
[57:05] out and really come true with God that
[57:08] real genuine feat they just got act
[57:10] called monument or no went on so forth
[57:12] today God can come down and shame said
[57:15] miraculously right among the people
[57:17] everything and I say well I just guess
[57:18] like this very well you know Graham says
[57:21] you know you had too much teaching
[57:25] I never taught us out that I never even
[57:31] knew had that much it taught so well
[57:35] that is taught of the feet so the common
[57:37] did know what taught it unknown another
[57:39] would become ever more towards you say
[57:43] you have too much teaching looking for
[57:45] new light so afterwards you same promise
[57:48] this fine piece of steel so then they
[57:51] want new revelations studied manner to
[57:54] bring up all connecting and then
[57:55] afterwards they get a connection a line
[57:58] connected to be pit I'm no see I'm mushi
[58:03] first after bring up some things on here
[58:04] boy and if you don't watch it and you
[58:07] know what's that word your figure is God
[58:09] but just Lucy with his tricks again
[58:12] bringing up revelations normal knowledge
[58:30] listen to me sis it's in here's a factor
[58:35] so the shake so you see you anymore you
[58:39] have anymore teachings and all she was
[58:43] to see it was God said she don't eat of
[58:47] that tree potential and what shall I
[58:49] concept so he said the daily eat the day
[58:52] we die hallelujah I ain't touching that
[58:55] tree get behind me Satan Paul said if I
[59:02] angel come down from heaven
[59:04] I'm preach any other gospel Paul went
[59:07] and see I come back and preach something
[59:09] different than I preached originally you
[59:11] say forget it let me be accurst
[59:13] or give the Lord a shout in the house or
[59:16] glory to God we have to stay with the
[59:18] original women because the original word
[59:20] is arisen on season and that is what the

[1:03:03] to receive the spirit the preachers are
[1:03:05] the priests of bigness spirit because a

[1:17:54] gonna do if he had begun so God make
[1:17:56] sure eat the gun not yet so then
[1:17:58] something came over him takeaways here

[1:18:07] evening did you hear that he is gone
[1:18:12] where is he back in evening just like

[1:18:42] don't normal normal normal
[1:18:43] any person normal oh man you know he has
[1:18:47] to come back in manufacturing experiment
[1:18:53] afterwards I remember I was in South
[1:18:59] Africa which is a local church here
[1:19:39] because in this period you want to say
[1:19:45] what is this you know what you do it all
[1:19:48] the demons have doped
[1:19:52] before imagine whoa but God put the feet
[1:20:00] inside here to believe it will be done
[1:20:05] hallelujah so I believe my commission is
[1:20:10] dying inside of here what God want me to
[1:20:11] do God send us another Church tell me
[1:20:13] for the end time that the power of the
[1:20:17] Holy Ghost can come unto her in the
[1:20:20] demonstrations of the Spirit and this is
[1:20:23] preaching the gospel not teaching and
[1:20:26] explaining unrevealing because
[1:20:29] revelation can come to is it become by
[1:20:32] written it will be who you are I am the
[1:20:34] Prime Minister on this that's written
[1:20:36] that's what I revelation is personal so
[1:20:38] they posted if I'm mr. Kazama say I am
[1:20:40] he
[1:20:40] what is I am II so it have words have
[1:20:43] manifestation always the revelation but
[1:20:45] this is specific that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:47] come in the church with the
[1:20:48] demonstration of the spirit mark 16 can
[1:20:52] follow the church acts 2:4 which is the
[1:20:54] refill in 38 which is the fill it all of
[1:20:57] it will be followed right along in the
[1:20:59] church signs and wonders accompany the
[1:21:02] Apostles
[1:21:03] what churches accompany apostles and
[1:21:06] teachings are come signs and wonders was
[1:21:09] part of the pitch that Wendy with the
[1:21:12] apostolate Church if we are going back
[1:21:14] sure we have to have that I wanna say it
[1:21:18] again we have to have that to vindicate
[1:21:21] we have been turned back to that because
[1:21:24] that is where the faith must express
[1:21:26] which is expressed if we go back to the
[1:21:30] theater the forest where are the works
[1:21:31] the father's did put the air shout today
[1:21:35] on that it's not the teachings of the
[1:21:38] father's is the faith of the fathers and
[1:21:40] works express faith
[1:21:46] show me the works then is a great signs
[1:21:54] of the his resurrection accompany them
[1:21:56] while we in person surely God is growing
[1:21:59] a crop somewhere for that last great
[1:22:01] kill maybe you my Christian friend here

[1:23:51] Amen Alleluia if they didn't want to go
[1:23:54] free then they were taken to the temple
[1:23:56] and was bought all in the air and then
[1:23:58] it could never go free again
[1:23:59] oh my so we find out many of us in these
[1:24:02] last days this pattern I got to this is
[1:24:03] important okay in the last days in our
[1:24:07] organization of Pentecost we have come
[1:24:10] in and organized ourselves and rejected
[1:24:12] the lesion of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:24:14] wisdom of groups of people instead here
[1:24:17] we go this is instead of having
[1:24:19] fellowship one with another
[1:24:21] it's divided us separated us into
[1:24:24] several different organization of people
[1:24:26] and in doing so it has blue
[1:24:27] Oh inheritance he is seeing inheritance
[1:24:32] get break up by the divisions and kind
[1:24:35] of a set of foolishness these walls
[1:24:38] inside if we ever get wall into a place
[1:24:41] where we can't accept the wooded and the
[1:24:43] holy spirit and after take the Creed's
[1:24:45] and so forth of a church instead of the
[1:24:47] power of the Holy Spirit that you really
[1:24:49] will never mean nothing to that person
[1:24:51] no matter how much you can say a mother
[1:24:53] left you inheritance daddy that your
[1:24:55] inheritance and whatnot he said but
[1:24:57] accept dogma that was injected into your
[1:24:59] fellowship
[1:25:00] instead of being free in Christ letting
[1:25:03] the Holy Spirit lead us along back in
[1:25:05] the age when it will be church was
[1:25:07] getting together immediately they have
[1:25:09] to go to organize in and when they did
[1:25:11] there was afraid that somebody else
[1:25:13] would be a leader but getting a little
[1:25:14] group dad issues that came in and then
[1:25:17] they had to organize these issues if
[1:25:18] they are left alone let the Holy Spirit
[1:25:21] read out and bring out and lead in and
[1:25:23] put in the church will be far too
[1:25:25] advanced let the Holy Spirit I mean
[1:25:28] every heavy inspiration and I'm teaching
[1:25:30] and things not right God but listen God
[1:25:34] is Guardian abortion God removes people
[1:25:37] off the ER tenem Boris if things are
[1:25:40] wrong enough for his purpose in whatever
[1:25:42] plan you know listen the Lord Himself
[1:25:45] descending in first Thessalonians for
[1:25:46] you to get this right you know you think
[1:25:48] he will let some man man and his wife
[1:25:50] not this Jesus I'm talking about the
[1:25:53] Lord Himself this time with a shout for
[1:25:56] them playing with at them for someone
[1:25:58] she could only hold church members they
[1:26:00] will never hold a bride and if they have
[1:26:02] to cry the bride will come out or
[1:26:04] blowing up or without key shepherds in
[1:26:07] the last days or glory that God himself
[1:26:13] no one man and his family could go back
[1:26:16] to the original Helen returns if they
[1:26:19] hear the jubilee trumpet song and know
[1:26:22] what it meant to them if they heard a
[1:26:24] priest on the trumpet the minister that
[1:26:26] trumpet is the gospel they had a
[1:26:27] privilege to come and receive again
[1:26:30] their heritage
[1:26:31] what your loss you go back to it oh my
[1:26:35] what we lost what they have a Pentecost
[1:26:38] we going back to Oh inheritors let me
[1:26:41] read it you see one can especially from
[1:26:42] the hour of Jubilee okay our Pentecostal
[1:26:45] experience years ago we find we have
[1:26:47] walled up ourselves away from that so
[1:26:48] far that we got to hear what somebody
[1:26:50] see instead of Gloucester the Lord and
[1:26:52] you can hear the word of God say no is
[1:26:55] the hour of Jubilee go back come back
[1:26:58] the way is affirmed come back to your
[1:27:01] original heritance to the real Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost again remember he could go free he
[1:27:08] didn't have to be nothing didn't have to
[1:27:11] do nothing just get up and go just just
[1:27:14] think about it you could get up tonight
[1:27:15] and go free go and sin no more
[1:27:17] son of man set free is free indeed
[1:27:22] cleany asleep IKEA sleep what if he knew
[1:27:26] the song of the trumpet but he had to
[1:27:27] know the song on the trumpet for thee as
[1:27:29] sons of God no faith come by hearing
[1:27:31] here in the Word of God when we hear
[1:27:33] that we are free and refused to act upon
[1:27:36] our freedom then we shall be sealed away
[1:27:38] from God to receive the mark of the
[1:27:40] peace for to hear is to receive when we
[1:27:44] hear we are free
[1:27:45] then we can accept it oh my when the
[1:27:49] here at the Jubilee song and he didn't
[1:27:51] want to be free sealed away from the
[1:27:54] kingdom he said today in celebration of
[1:27:56] the Holy Ghost revival that we used to
[1:27:58] have musician how a piece I hear or
[1:28:00] father's talk about or the Indians came
[1:28:01] down and sang in the meetings and the
[1:28:03] power of God taken over the Saints were
[1:28:05] born again and things happen and it come
[1:28:07] from an old-fashioned sky blue cynical
[1:28:09] and preaching all Sassafrass type men
[1:28:11] did not know the ABCs but a note Christ
[1:28:13] I've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:15] and that is what we hunger for today is
[1:28:18] an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy
[1:28:19] Ghost and a pouring out of God's
[1:28:21] blessing back to the old line again if
[1:28:24] the devil has took you captive it is
[1:28:27] Jubilee time it is time to come back to
[1:28:31] the OL experience again back to the
[1:28:33] old-fashioned Bible back to the place
[1:28:35] where we can feel the power of God
[1:28:37] Church true that will call heaven
[1:28:40] to the altar that will make them stay on
[1:28:42] your face all night long and pray to God
[1:28:44] and seek for deliverance what a time
[1:28:47] what we need today is a color note I'll
[1:28:49] pull it out I'll pull it out jubilee
[1:28:51] old-fashioned revival is what we need or
[1:28:53] are we painting to Calvary what we need
[1:28:56] is to revive what's exactly what we need
