been good to us so this Alice ball has gonna pray Heavenly Father we need your Lord and we need your touch and I pray father for the family that you would visit them and minister to them in your own special way God you are seeing a portion of my family my loved ones and the others dear need to hear from you and I need a touch from you father may heaven drop down Lord and minister to them father and just as we testified and preached that even though somebody going on their prayer is not in vain is not lost an adult man would have prayed for our children and our grandchildren and the family father may you hear an answer pray O God has has been bottled up and stored up O God we thank you for your lovin as we approach your wit tonight come on us and speak to hearts we are here to finish this work the finishes we commissioned father a bright prepared for the for Jesus Christ have your we I pray in Jesus I ask it you love him designed amen god bless you and welcome if of your Bibles I like you to turn to Acts chapter 19 I wanna read verse 1 to 6 I want to read Matthew chapter 5 1 verse 4 6 and also much you chapter 25 really fumbles wanted to team first country-region tonight reading from acts 19 verse 1 came the pass while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper course to came to Ephesus and finance certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since he believed and they said to him we have not so much as what did there be any Holy Ghost he said unto them until what then were you baptized they said unto John baptism and then said Paul then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance seen and unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied so this Holy Ghost that came upon him was an experience that they received it was an explanation it was not teaching it was not edification and tried to show them what inside of them it was an experience that they receive and from Matthew 5:6 he said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled our last scripture from chapter 25 of Matthew then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them Elias five of foolish D that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried and the oil slumbered and slept at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered and said see not so at least they're not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and did our poor ready they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and a door was shut afterwards chemo so the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the Lord yasur always a privilege for me to be in the house of God for us to come into God's presence and we looking forward to see what Lord will do for us tonight our title tonight bright material wise virgins strange combination of words but which see what will or will do bright material wise verges have a contact Scripture and this is from Acts chapter 5 eat a reading from verse 5 Acts chapter 8 from verse 5 then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them what did he preach Christ unto them and the people with one Accord give heed unto those things which Philip speak hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crime but a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with policies and that will lean were healed and there was great joy in that city so this was hopeful it was preaching the gospel this is all the word was being confirmed this is all the acts 16 was getting into accent oh praise got another scripture we harvest from sin John 12 verse 22 24 and there were sitting Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of the taste of godly and desired him saying so we would see Jesus and Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered them saying they always come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I sent you except a corner we'd fall into the ground and die it abideth owned but if I died bringing forth much fruit oh praise God so I ready to smoke tonight ok let's go no this is from so you see Jesus where I'm saying some stuff he said knowing that there was some God somewhere told many Greeks and they had thousands of them that they worshipped the head of a historical quad that none miracles and among the Hebrews and I also heard that this God that you said be a miracle book in Hebrew God was over here in the land with them again so it attracted the attention so they came to see Jesus now notice usually the way people want to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him a leader or one of his servants is do we define him here we go so Jesus if he ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him because it is his purpose to serve the people now they brought unto his presence and I guess into his presence these Greeks Philip they consulted Philip and Philip said no here is someone that wants to see our Lord so it wouldn't be just right for me to have the honor to introduce these Greece to my lord I'll go get aren't you to go with me so they went got Andrew Andrew and Philip boat came and presented these Greeks to Jesus now here is a greeting and a text that's unusual just as soon as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself now this is big Ian hood like I know your nose already but this is what Jesus did not point to himself nor did he make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus in that way Jesus is known in that way we see in the scripture that when these Greeks brought brought up to Jesus and won in his presence it looked like Jesus could have said well I am the Messiah of Jewish race has been predicted by the prophets by inspiration don't do the cemeteries and I am here now and I am born of Nazareth I'm a Jewish of a Jewish mother my father is God I'm here to make myself known to you Greeks no that would be more like the 1961 version of this but look as soon here we go as they are brought in his presence that's the main thing get the people in his presence and as soon as in his presence jesus said except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and die it abideth on what an unusual thing instead of accepting the introduction the thing he done was to point them to the place where they could find him except a corner weight falls in the ground and die it abides alone what did he do here he pointed them to that great truth how to see him they could not see him in the way of eternal life just stand-in there though he was he was a man but he pointed them dear in his presence Christ pointed them to the truth he said to see him was to go to the cross that is where it is at the cross except a corner with falls in its Abbes alone and if he did not die he would have to abide alone himself if he did not die but him being the corner weak that fell into the ground and then if it falls into the ground he said it will bring forth abundance it will fall into the ground and dies first it had to be a zoomit eyes green or glory to God what he meant is watch if I live my alone and died this week I just live my life alone well then there'd be no food after me here we go I already but if I fall into the ground under the will of God I will bring forth a new bullet and that new bullet will bring forth another new ability and another new birth until the whole world will be missionary and gospel preached so he was pointing them that the cross will produce the new birth because his water blood and spirit so the cross will release the ingredients to produce the new build or glory to God and the new birth spreading from one to another who glory to God so that is why Parker asks the question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe because you're supposed to receive it after you believe or glory the God not when you believe after you believe you receive something to confirm you have faith in what you have received as belief or do you leave that glory to God so listen to this now so if we ourselves in our ministry you know what thoughts are in our life if we are bad as we are we can do no good we got to also die at the altar or we will live alone we will live to some Organic denomination or some Creed we will live to some organization but if we die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit here we go will be spread for everywhere by our lips we have got to die all glory to God what happened Peter wins at the house of Cornelius while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word and they were baptized where the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was coming out in man mount out of the lips by the word of God being spoken so the world coming out a man mount and gore taking a word and trapping the spirit straight long into people's heart being baptized by the Holy Ghost this is what God promised in the last days we believe that all right so we must realize Oh Chloe aah we must realize that we have got to die in order to bring forth new life this not read this book what book Emma dinner isn't the tape and press on play Dino Dutton this is different this is you understand that you have to die you have to die - what you think - what you feel though your opinion and the ideas you have to get rid of that and say Lord kill me get the self that tell your human spirit die hallelujah you have to come to the spot where your hunger and intestine after righteousness you can't stand the world no more because it's it for something higher and to even get there you have to be blessed not everybody have that blessing you know if you are hungry for God tonight you are blessed you actually men dysley blessed and this hour here with all them Devils loose out the hell binding the people up and you free to be hungry and thirsty for God you shall be filled you have no question about it you shall be filled or glow lit up god bless her that day that hunger and kiss after righteousness it means you are empty note it means you give in room and space for God Oh hallelujah you can be filled with your thoughts and filled with the Holy Ghost - still with you always and filled with only goes to your always that they can boot out your process or get boot out your ways as they get boot out and then there's a space inside a deer for that white light to pass through your being or glory Nikora leave a portion of himself inside a deer [Applause] know what I said you have no ready for that white light the past true you wish and drop a spark inside idea Oh hallelujah let's go now so he must realize that we have to die in order to bring forth the new life he said so much in this if you want to see me you must die you'll come to this Tabernacle no joint Church you have to die to see him or glory to God says you want to see what he passed all Jesus we want to see Jesus and Jesus pointed away you will see him at the cross Oh glory to God you see people people want a priest because they don't

a heart of flesh that corrupt gotta have this wicked you know you have a heart to watch me what have to give your operation and change your heart to give your heart towards him you ain't ready yet

doctrine oh yeah that is it I know tomando under live as long I'm on make-believe as now I'm talking about the saved church and in deceived church have two classes why is vision and foolish vision so we're not talking about Pope room I will say Putin Russia Catholic Church me not talking with them we love my Pentecostal doctors we talk about the message people [Applause] some staying back to assist others in the Tribulation Period and some going up yonder you have to decide which you want to join or wish you want to get involved with if you will become bright material because where they will cut your cloth until is the right kind of cloth you [Music] have to become right material I only get the break materials you can lay it out and then bring the scissors because you're dropping no room you know you're just wrapping yourself in some more color it is the bustling show you have to get cut this material will be cut so if you think you will sit down intact as you are in your human spirit so perfect and so normal as you complete your dead wrong that are working [Music] [Applause] [Music] now I notice is that they cannot go for people like but is the entire evangelism is shaping spawns because the spawn is a confession as soon as a rock not your hammer realization that's a wrap but they have to be cut to be fitted in God's program to be fitted in the pulley go short or give

Schine you know mr. China's Jesus was led by the Holy Ghost after he was filled with the fullness of the power of God the spirit led him into the wilderness he wasn't doing nonsense and stumbling to the wilderness the spirit say go so he said no one else President Ilham straight into the wilderness because gotta be table Lucifer you have to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life before power is released him from ministry [Applause] we say something tonight did you get what I'm saying before he could get power from ministry he opposed to overcome self not overcome in a group [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what is he a man of this will you know when he came to Satan the Bible says he returned in the power of the Spirit hallelujah to find a structure to manifest the word for yahwah okay the Lord a shout he can't just Manny says anything you have to find where it is written the Spirit is upon me and it was all glory the corner we have a promise revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride before the baby comes to word identify well Gloria's got the spirit leads the bridal to the wilderness to overcome Lucifer or glory we have to overcome Lucifer because he set his kingdom on this earth oh yeah and we about to preach the kingdom of God before we have to have Bacchus on the kingdom and the kingdom must be within you and the kingdom is not a word [Applause] or get the Lord a shout the kingdom is nothing word the kingdom is in power and you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost come upon you honey tend to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers to do what to bring down the Holy Ghost or give the Lord a shout the object of the fitness to do I have a nice church no to bring down the Holy Ghost [Applause] so butter Baron says them disciples before they did anything they took these Greeks into the presence of Jesus I like that in the presence but in the teaching and the presence I had a doctrine in the Bible book if you Rosita's DC new fellowship they many presents yet they have not body missing by day but not presence Oh hallelujah you see what I'm saying that is see Mussina possible they seem as in a pastor Creed that's the same as saying Hail Mary and to our Father that make a Catholic does he seem I seen all of that God wants you to come into his presence not the presence of the posture his presence the pastor has to get in his presence I'm not hearing you tonight everybody after coming to his presence Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to God let's go watch and they took these Greeks into the presence of Jesus and if he's the same Alabama if he's the same yesterday and forever he will have to act the same today if you are brought into his presence disciples today is so much different today they bring you to some other place to some church some organization some doctrine laws we believe it so watch but never get you into the presence of Christ there we go almost done this afoot in part a real true disciple would bring you right straight into the presence of Christ are you ready and from dear Christ would show you what you had to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright let's cut you know so we could get you here question but a Balam are the five foolish virgins on March 25 counted as the Gentile remnant I understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but have to go through the Great Tribulation Period is this correct if so what will be the final destination could there be the sheep that was divided from goats and Marty 25 Brum said a pretty good to theologian you see he said now that they are the remnant the civil version is the remnant spoke of in Revelation of the woman's seed that keeps the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ a woman will take a piece of goods Claud unlived on and she takes a pattern and leaves anywhere she desires which way she's going to cut that and then when she has the left over is called the remnant but she chooses to cut it from a certain place by our own free thinking but what is left over is called the remnant and if you notice that they were five foolish and five wise virgins all of them was virgins made out of the same material but by election here we go God chooses bride by election before the foundation of the world hallelujah put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life slain from before the from visible before the world ever began the day in the funeral that I did Somali I was talking about considering the end he said the Bible said that at the end of something than the beginning hallelujah and to consider the end in your decisions and actions consider the endgame where you want to end up what the end will be is not where you start because because Joseph started kick totem and and shun by his brothers but he ended up as the right hand of Pharaoh Oh glory to God David was a shepherd boy that's when he stopped but he ended up in king of Israel it's not my dear status not where you are as very gonna end so you have to consider help me turn on my DS I got on my end but God will start from the beginning he stuff on the end he know that's why he gets a only four new eco Lori called justified origin he know where you're going already that's already glorified so he finishes already and then come at the beginning and start the story then Satan is trapped because he don't understand it's finished already okay the Lord has shown because he starts at the end or Gloria already in the Millennium you already knew city you already have a new body everything is covered already already glorified and you come and I can roll back the tape here and put you to trouble so God is not rolling dice and so quad I hope you make it I want to look tonight not because a way they behaved last night no no God not that kind of frightened mode God know the end from the beginning or glory to God if Israel were to consider their behavior they never they never said we can take it or glory does caught it in under saccade bring them out the same father brought him out judge them because it wasn't considered the end and the Bible said teasing happen for examples for whom the ends of the will have come or glory the caution learn from their behavior learn from the attitude not God is a good god all the time that's a phrase what is the core of the word Oh hallelujah okay the Lord a shout praise God praise God hallelujah glory to God is not he who starts if you finishes these are sprint is a long distant race yourself well Korea don't have patience with God have patience with yourself pace yourself this race is not for the Swift but him nothing go on to the end all glory to God be in for the long haul [Applause] that's right be not tired dice why be not weary that's why we could start an after the promise of God to on the leaf but stronger than praise for God because we in this thing for the long haul we're not looking for shortcuts there are no shortcuts you have to die to yourself oh - oh we don't want a shortcut I believed if I have it as a shortcut nice nice Baptist doctrine in glorified mode hallelujah as a Baptist doctrine on turbo when you believe it you have it when they receive the message daddy holy goes I could Baptist doctrine Paulette preach that but is that what Paul preached he said hardly received since you believe they say we are know what is Holy Ghost in you're talking about we have no more this fire we are no more this power via no modesty Munchie sense and killing heaven high hell hot or Kobe and over this kind of thing is a yeah yeah yeah we have it you have to get it Oh plural of God and they were filled with the Holy Ghost celebratin we'll be sitting so tell me something Legion fill with a Thousand Devils because you have no limit with them Devils could take you away if a man could be filled with Devils should be suddenly kid once a Mac we see stuff like a fella with poor Depot's then they will see the man doing all kind of stuff the kind of stuff Jesus did because you see the same most I do shall you do also when you have my spirit inside of you dino game thing board fella Mahmud is Holy Spirit hallelujah demand not talking talking talking Philip wasn't talking Philip and the new miracles he cast out Devils He healed the sick he wasn't asking them ministers Association permission to preach the gospel with signs one of the miracles the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe the Bible said the Lord Himself when everywhere with them confirming the word with signs not man doing that God doing that or give the Lord a shout because God was working with damn whose dance the early church the alpha church or glory of God the book of Acts church the church he sent the professional hats back to order the Lord showed a no no's modern singer all glory that's why I say get on fire or glory no God bring your fire with you I come and fire every time I come here as fire coming bring yours Oh hallelujah you either wonder what mines you bring yours when yours when your fire go either God hallelujah hallelujah my glory said the bride is it it shows my election it's not right so then the fullest version was the one who did not have oil in their lamps the happy box the heavy tapes the happy preachers they have the ministers they have for 50 years but no oil so the oil is something different then if the butcher is oil and as the oil just piles in the business stuff it in your clothes sleep on it a would wrestle undress with just this book one book and wrap yourself up in it and another stick would make a wave hat it cannot be that he's talking about but something is your preaching the word is the word you're preaching we can't pre Saturn and Venus and Mars even though there's a Bible up there you have to preach the word

spirits upon a bride do you understand the bride is and be the one forty seven and the church is second Timothy four heavy and high-minded Emily's you spirits the bride spirit is full to knowledge temperance peace that's the bride ear that's the bright materially well glory there go that's what God cotton just remembers heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers God chief because in the church Liars in the church it was English that chalice people in the church back biters in the church wreath disrespectful in the search [Music] [Applause] [Music] a great solution came to me early and said I believe God it was imputed on differences I said that is true he said what more can a man do by belief I said that's all he could do he said but didn't where do you go with this Holy Ghost stuff I've said that that no you know he was about this he said where do you go with his Holy Ghost if a man believed the minute you believe you poverty really goes I said no no you make a contradiction in the Scriptures the scriptures no contradict themselves Paul asked them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I said it's true Abraham the father of faith he a promise of collaborative God it was imprisoned him for righteousness but he give him the seal of circumcision as a sign that he had received his fate and if he have never sealed you with the Holy Ghost yet he has never received your faith in Him you've got some loose places you might believe but there's a lot of loose places but when you get all the pop news places back right then he sees where the holy goes until the day of your Redemption that is God's confirmation that he has received a faith that you possess in him professing him oh my the church will see where that Dogma this is not good this is not good when God gives you the Holy Ghost it is settled you know where you stand you know what happened you are sealed all the day totality of your Redemption your destination on this earthly journey that oughta make anybody does have faith and believe God and rise up in the power of the Spirit now these versions did not get the Holy Spirit the only thing the last was all in their lamps they had the books they had the mysteries they had the knowledge they had all knowledge but not the oil they had the best dishes but the greatest revelations but not the oil [Music] some bring any oil is a different ingredient and yet the word is spirit and the spirit is life you know either couldn't get the oil because the word of the Spirit is what they rejected and last service I quoted it for you my voice has gone I didn't have it here tonight to see it back but he says the church the bride that rejected the head pact of the bride would have to suffer it if that be so then the thunders capped the pyramid then the seven thunders is the head part of that the seven thunders is in the Holy Spirit slot beneath that is the seven churches but God put that slot there and LOV is Christ's corporate body coming down and then only there's this spirit coming you have to be caught up into this spirit so lowers you are you have to be magnetized not by teaching but by the Holy Ghost the teacher has to become spirit in you then you become magnetized so when the brain love Divine magnatum it can pick you up take you up it's not coming for you it's currently the same material you are thoroughly magnetized to the headstone magnet capital paper magnet capital wood magnet capital plastic it could only pick up the metal that is money as I say it so whatever whatever inside of you your flash' wrong it is have to go through so when God come you've got to be raptured because this power it's inside of you that's why I said a rapture gonna be in you you're not going to the rapture who glory bells got the rapture will be in you you'll be changed in a moment what's on the inside gonna change what's on the outside no church to give it let's continue you see they were back in the church age there were some of them there was good people but it wasn't in this night they with with with the wick dipped into oilmen it was out it was gone out they had separated themselves Paul said and he give a scripture for that he said they separate themselves from us seemingly not have benefit so when they walk out and they turn on defeat and you know what give it right seven thunders give it seven thunders the word right so they will hurry from the faith and they don't understand they will hold from the channel to access the oil they love the prophet they love the message they love the books in love what they hear and they love the Brethren but they do have any oil not make them off foolish virgin certified people nice people people to hug and laugh and fellowship with all night long but no

we don't believe this mental intellectual message ting Baptist doctrine that they have on steroids [Music] we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not by a mythical intellectual conception of the Scriptures but by an experience that's the oh no no no if the one can know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch all your life patterns after that and it will tell the kind of spirit coming to you because spirit is coming to people or glory to God I can't tell you how that brings God you got to know and you'll see the life you live a stake at the experience but that experience is a must not going to intellectualize it what I want to explain to you you sit in his soul and as your real king and Holy Ghost not the real thing go no come with that you have a coming up with a revelation and that like that Lucifer all over again trying to intellectualize this experience have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that is the Holy Ghost and real Holy Ghost it's the

mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you would walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you will not do see that's the way it has to be all believers they are mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus live in a world nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them he said they use riddles you see so when a man here we go lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance faith so he's bringing it that you were getting the reality of it live by faith walk by faith then he
