you have here i'm going to explode oh hallelujah oh praise god amen we're not here just to educate we're here to motivate we are to inspire we are to make you rise up as i'm going to fight i'm going to press i'm going to overcome i'm going to stand i'm going to live for god that's what we're here to do all scripture is given by inspiration is profitable for rebuke and corruption and instruction in all righteousness the scripture is there to do something for our lives it didn't benefit israel because the word wasn't mixed with fate so they just press on in inertia straight line same beat day in day out no change whatsoever same attitude no expectation but you see inertia is interrupted by an external force i will be your external force so your feet will be interrupted in this church you will not continue the way you come you're gonna be transformed something but to change you i interrupt your feet i'll interrupt your walk i'll interrupt your attitude that is what i'm here for oh get the lord praise his people don't even tell me your all because while abraham was whole the bible said he's tagged not at the promise of god don't let me start preaching here i want merely but for strong giving praise to god so i wonder all men and yeah give god praise i want the young men and you give god praise and you young men don't sit there back sitting i call you young man because you are strong don't even tell me you're tired don't tell me you're weak don't tell me the camera kept because he called a young man because you are strong you could test your trials you could face your mountain [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah you know what they call this day palm sunday you know what happened today everybody was in jerusalem everybody had an expectation they didn't know what was going to happen and all of a sudden a donkey came riding all of a sudden a man was on that donkey he was the messiah the king came right in lonely that was our king riding humbly that was our dynamics that was our power that was our reign jesus come riding into jerusalem and the people begin to shout again to worship the hosanna hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord you better bring your worship and the people got so terrified they said stop them for worshiping he said if i stop there the rock's gonna cry out i can't stop when the time comes for the people to worship if i stop the rock's going to cry out this message is alive god is not dead he is still alive still alive he's still in the healing business the delivering business the restoring business the anointing business and the thing i love about him you may be seated is that nobody could keep you from receiving your blessing oh hallelujah nobody could hold back your your blessing from you oh hallelujah oh he he's the lovely one this morning oh have we are blessed to be in this age this is the last stage saturday is the last age hallelujah that's good this is the last age we don't have another age coming we're going to close this age up with a shout we're going to leave this world with a shout out we wouldn't leave this world scratching our head like lot's wife looking back to see what we're leaving back no this bribe olivia shouted we'll be saying goodbye world good morning glory that's what we're going to be saying goodbye world good morning glory that's what people will be saying we're going to be changed you know about change we ought to be changed right now on the inside and then the body is going to be changed we'll be changing the very atoms in a moment in the trick of an eye and we will not be here we have a scripture a man named enoch remember to see that he walked with god and was not for god took him but before god took him you see there's so much people like to talk about what god allow it's almost like if there is no devil what god allowed and god allowed the devil to afflict me and god allowed this and stop studying with god allow and start to study what you have a right to you see because god gave promises inside of here that we have to take the kingdom is preached and every man pressed their way into it and those who understand who they are they could take it only those you see you see when those fighters they were taking some land i think we read it already joshua tell them he said listen we want some food for men we're going to take the kings of this this one and that king head off and that king all and the king was the guy said what happened you know you're going to do that what are you talking about they don't want to get them he said when i come back i'll go beat you because when god said to take that then fellas are saying how do we have enough men do we have enough sword do we have enough ability that was not the question the question is if god said it we just do it we execute it so these guys were so positive they said we're going to take them king's head off we need food we are hungry farmers should give us food the man said they want to get them food you say when they come back we'll deal with you man they take them king's head off handle the whole thing and come back and put licks because that is what they say they want to do so listen we are hungry this morning this evening we have we have some battle to do this evening are you with me are you going to fight this even let's all stand for the word deuteronomy chapter 8 amos chapter 3 and revelation chapter 10 for the word remembering me on prayer on wednesday i'm on my way to every course the easter meeting and i request i'm expecting a great time over there in the lord next month supposed to be cameroon praise god so let's deuteronomy chapter 18 of verse 1 all the commandments which i command it is the shall be observed to do that he may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shall remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would have keep his commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffer due to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord that man live amos three we want to read from verse seven and eight and next we read revelation 10 8 11. read the names 3 through 7. surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion had roared who will not fear the lord god had spoken who can but prophesy revelation 10 you want to read from verse 8. and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again saying go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standing upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter shall be nine more to this honey i took the little book out of the angel's hand ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me though must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings that's about his father we have read your word blessed speak may they hear your word from your mouth your voice in jesus might ask it amen and amen you might be seated the title i have this evening is the word from the mouth of god on subject living by the word title again the word from the mount of god jesus said it when the devil tempted him to turn the stone into bread he quoted the scripture man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god and i'm talking today about the word from the mount of god now there are billions of people on the earth millions of mouths on the earth men and preachers on the earth it's wanting for words to come at the mouth of a man or men but is another thing for it to come out the mouth of god when god brought all the children of israel and they came to the mountain and fire came upon the mountain and the mountain began to shake and earthquake and so on the people said don't let god speak let moses speak and god say okay i'm going to let moses speak he going to be my mouthpiece isn't that right so then the mouthpiece of god are his prophets and amus said surely the law will do nothing except he revealed the secrets unto his servants the prophets so therefore when adam fell god continued in his creation to try to find a man who would live every word he tried to find a man that would live the word for his age and we find out that satan caused adam to fall by that one word by saying you shall not surely die and god continue on in his creation to try to find one man that would live by every word his first man feel and this man would live his time his age living now there are different ages that god prophesied from the beginning which would take place all down and that's the reason he could tell the end from the beginning what if moses had brought noah's message it wouldn't work what if jesus brought moses message it wouldn't work so we can't bring a methodist message or a baptist message or a pentecostal message it wouldn't work isn't that right so we've got to find out what the scripture says for today that's why jesus said in this way he that believe it on me as the scripture had said amen in other words it has come right back to what's written in the scriptures isn't that right so god excuse me is going to judge the world by the church which one catholic six hundred and sixty something you know foreign is going to judge the world by jesus christ because in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and brought among us god and the word is the same and this is god in print [Applause] this is god in print i want to say that again this is god in print so that's why the devil don't want you to even read the bible because this is god in print but jesus said it is written it is written it is written oh give the lord some praises [Applause] so the word of god is god on print brethren god on print here we go jehovah printed on a book i'll give the lord some praises jehovah printed on a book isn't that right here we go he has got to judge a church by some standard and he cannot judge it by the standard of any system that we have made so they are churches and they are systems built around the churches how they are humiliate the deacons or how they jam the trustees or how they press the ushers and how they do this or how to do that how they straighten their members out they have systems around the world systems are built around the world but it's not the word the word is always god [Applause] so when jesus came he came amid systems pharisees scribes sadducees he seens he met systems and he was the word so he was bringing the present tense reality of truth but they had the systems that was built around the truth which was spot santan's gospel hand washing gospel thou shalt not and do this and do that and he came and bring the word and when he brought the word it was rejected because the word is always rejected because the world can't handle truth and system is built off of the world because system is always man-made but the word is god [Applause] church is man-made but revelation upon this rock i'll build my church that's [Applause] god and he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it fight with it wrestle with it come against it so when god put a tick on your life before the foundation of the world no man can x you off only eight i will say it again when god put a tick on your life a green tick on your life before the foundation of the world nobody can x you down here come on now come on rory [Applause] the woman in the well she had a tick on her life before the foundation of the world but then earth they put the x on her and jesus came to tell her you have a take-up csa woman don't bother with those men i come to tell you you have a green tick you are all right you are fine oh i want to hear a bigger shout than that [Applause] okay so watch because every one of our systems and my need and listen it has to be judged now if you want to disagree and say no i believe you're wrong there but branham i believe ours or the other fellow would say well always is where then which one is right then there are 900 different systems of it so god could not judge the church by 900 different systems there will be one and that will be god will judge the world by jesus christ and christ is the word so that is why every church is suffering and you cannot take the standard of one church and show it in another church the standard is the word regardless of where that church is this is the standard not race not color not here not skin just the word because this written word is what became flesh in the person of jesus christ he was this word made alive i want to hear your ride with me this evening so when they asked john the baptist who are you he said i am the voice of one crime in the wilderness he was quoting the written scriptures he was quoting the word himself because the scripture is the word from the mount of god [Applause] oh hallelujah and when the mouth of god speaks something nothing could stop it he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that i sent it to accomplish [Applause] you don't know how i feel this evening glory so jesus knowing the scriptures knowing what david said i shall not suffer my soul that soul and corruption not leave my legal soul in hell my holy one he knew david spoke speaking about him by prophecy because men of all were moved by the spirit and spoke the prophecy and when jesus read that scripture he could wrest his soul on it because that was the word from the mount of god he said destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up myself jesus was relied on the word from the mouth of god that was spoken to david come on same and somebody they were so convinced that it was from god they could hang their soul on it jesus said destroy this body never a man speak like fat man never a man speak like that man [Applause] do you do you understand daniel daniel said i read my books and i understood the time that was at hand and i began to seek the lord because all these brothers understood that the word from the mount of god cannot fail man's word will not stand but this word one time jesus have not will pass away but my words will never pass away he was so convinced of where he come from and what he was he could say my word will never pass away come on are you going with me now oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah so we are coming back that we could live by the scriptures live by the word oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated let me just share a few scriptures with you matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in the city of nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene matthew 13 34 all these things take jesus unto in them unto the multitude and parables and without a power speaking out unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world matthew 27 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of by the prophet they parted my comments among them and upon my vested cast nuts mark 7 6 he answered them and said well how isaiah's prophesy of you hypocrites for it is written these people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me so you begin to understand that jesus was living the word and identifying scripture being fulfilled because he knew every word that came out from the mouth of god it can't fail it can't lie it's the truth you shall know the truth and the truth gonna set you free we need to hear a word not any word but the word from the mount of god hallelujah [Music] and jesus john 12 when he had found a young ass on saturn thereon had it is written fear not thought of zion behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass a cold oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah you see i recognize people don't know the scriptures oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah they know what preachers say but they don't know what the bible say hallelujah this time i think i'm gonna read this scripture what do they represent i think i'm gonna go ahead and take it from matthew chapter uh 21. i'm gonna read it you could find it if you want chapter 21 and when the june 9 of jerusalem which will come of best page onto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples oh listen this is beautiful saying unto them go this is jesus go into the village against you and straight where you shall find an ass tied and a cold with her loose them and bring them unto me now now if this not handled right these guys could be arrested for theft if this is not handled right you could call the authorities because they didn't own that jesus didn't raise that and jesus told his disciples he said go and you're going to find these animals there just loose them and bring them to me now hear the subtext if any man say unto you ye shall say the lord had need of them listen that's not all and straightway he will send them this is not a mean man this is not a stingy man this is not a selfish man this is a man that has the ability to surrender to the will of god straightway [Applause] now what i want to point at you is this when the season changes for the scripture to be fulfilled they have to lose that cult [Applause] we are coming for the cold you don't hear what i'm saying you are not hearing what i am saying and no man going to ask what we want with it because the lord has need of it oh give the lord some praises people i'm saying the lord i mean of somebody inside of here brother the devil got to take his hands off of your life could we give the lord some praises so could you imagine those brothers going straight and loosing the coat the man said wait wait wait wait he said the lord a little bit he's okay go ahead man you should be screaming you understand what happened there your healing coming your deliverance coming it's luke your victory how many feeling lose the radiance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what's what's all this about this was done watch what this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold i king cometh unto thee me sitting upon an ass and a colt on a fool of an ass watch and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought her ass in the cold and they put in them clothes and let them sit there on now the thing about it all the time jesus telling people don't say anything don't tell nobody don't announce anything amen that's how jesus was just keeping quiet inside but this was different this was this was going to be a eruction the whole jerusalem this is going to affect everything because this was a nonsense whole new turn of his ministry now this was going big public big time all the people came along to celebrate and so forth this was this was big this was really big and a very great molecule to spread their comments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strain them in the way because normally when the king come in you lay a carpet you live a robe you do something they will lay in things so what kind of mad people is that who am i and the molecules that went before them cried hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved the whole message was moved everybody was moved who is who was moved and god is about to produce a move that going to shake a short quick message that going to shake the whole nation it's prophesied it's promise oh hallelujah when the cd was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved singing who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all of them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changes and the seats of them that sold doves and said of them it is written by the football he said it is written my father's house shall be called a house of prayer and you have made it to dinner thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and healed them and when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple saying hosanna of the son of david they were so displeased if you think people will be pleased with signs wonders miracles with the worship you were wrong they were so displeased who was this please religious people scripture bearing people book reading people tape listening people they would be pleased that's why you can't please man you have to please god you have to listen to the word coming from the mount of god oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] luke 4 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit in the galilee they went to the fame of him showed all the regions round about and he taught in the synagogues being glorified of all he came up to nazareth where he had been brought up as it was his customers he went in the synagogue on a saturday and stood for to read and it was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and he found the place where it was written the spirit ah you see it now so he wasn't just living a flat life a flimsy life a shallow life he was living by the word he found the place not even the scripture being read was a random scripture it was a chosen scripture it's a scripture he found to effect a season change and time and purpose he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recover into the sight of the blind to set that liberty them to the bruce to preach the acceptable year of the lord he closed the book he gave it to the minister sat down and all the eyes of them that when his synagogue were fastening him and he began to say unto him this day is this scripture fulfilled oh glory to god i wonder what you want to see i wonder what the bride gonna say you're waiting for a healing so long but you're gonna say this damn this scripture is fulfilled i was reading about the prophet pray for a woman i think she had some stomach conditions she could need and he prayed for her and she was so sick and for three weeks she going through pain and struggling and whatnot praise god and people mocking her and scuffing her because she was just believing god and trusting god and after a while she just failed to eat something she eat one thing she eats something else and afterwards she recognized she was healed she ran out praising god the prophet said the angel of god listen listen he said the word of healing what happened god said thus saith the lord you shall be healed and that's dusty lord is the word coming out from god when he had thoughts here the lord can't feel for three weeks she is struggling she is looking like she is all sick and after three weeks he said the angel of the lord passed by her neighborhood and fulfilled what god had spoken three weeks before so don't you give up you passed through that prayer line last sunday don't you doubt one moment praise god they shall lay hands on the sheep and they shall be healed [Applause] glory glory to god amen hallelujah praise god you believe that let's continue now in order to have faith faith have to have a basis you can't let faith be loose and wild faith has to rest not upon the shifting signs of man's reasoning but faith is based on the solid rock of god's word so once you have the word the word becomes a platform to rest your faith on it's got to rest on something isn't that right that's why jesus could rely on david's words that's why daniel daniel all these prophets could rely on one another word because they know where the source is they know where it come from it came from the mouth of god so this word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word it is exciting to me it is thrilling to me to know we are called to live by the scripture itself i'm expecting this world to be activated in your spirit to be activated in your soul i expect you to connect with your scripture i expect you to have victory from this day forward so faith is based rest on god's word so faith can float faith after rest i want to say faith can float you have no floating fate it has to rest oh hallelujah on something isn't that right and it must rest on the word so you need the word you need a word from the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god jairus was a secret believer he couldn't confess he really believed the messiah because he was going to kick him out the synagogue they was going to press him out from his special position in church and gave him a backseat somewhere and smallify him that's not a word that doesn't reduce him he's not put pressure on him but jairus is he god has forced the issue his daughter got so sick that jairus couldn't be silent anymore private anymore or secret anymore he know the word was made flesh and it was alive and quickly but healing virtue power for service flowing freely out of the body of this man called jesus so tyrus glory [Applause] straight to jesus and say lord god is sick while he's yet speaking somebody said yes do you even bother with him i saved all the embarrassment she's dead sick dead sick dead from sick to dead from bad to worse and that didn't remove jesus sometimes things go from bad to worse and you move oh and all the emotions shaken up but jesus he stood still he said go wake up come she's sleeping come come okay let's let's go let's go do something about this situation we have here listen let's do something about come on now praise god you boxing that that's no problem we're gonna bring you right back you said that's your problem we're gonna see you here come on now you know that's no problem we're gonna get you up we're gonna get you up okay the lord i shout glory [Applause] god going to force the issue for all those secret believers he's going to push them out yeah you're going to want a testimony you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah when jesus come instead of coffee and biscuit and wailing and weeping he said just get them unbelievable to here get them i don't want that anointing because that does bring a spirit that does bring a negative atmosphere just get that out of here bring faith with me bring virtue with me bring knowledge with me bring an atmosphere with me bring temperance and patience bring bring people who want to worship bring people who want to praise bring people who want to see a reality bring people who want to see the supernatural oh do we have do we have such a people yet tonight little lady rice give her something to eat get some chicken and chips or some hot dogs give her sandwich she rolls up right there that's the cheese we serve and guess what he's the same yesterday today and forever that sounds good i'll say it again he's the same yesterday today and forever if he healed before he's the same yesterday today and forever if he did never before he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the jesus we are preaching glory hallelujah hallelujah first peter 411 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god second peter 2 1 21 for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals his secrets unto his servants the prophets now listen to this from now this into a change he said they have gotten away from the word they are lukewarm about it for seven out of seven ages i've seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mind so at the end of this age i'm spewing you out of my mouth it is all over revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin the song the mystery of god which shall be finished as he declared that they saved the prophets here it is here we go he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost two thousand years listen to the kind he is sending someone who is far from organization education the world of religion that has joined the baptist and elijah of all he will hear only from god this last day prophet he will have thus here the lord and speak for god he will be god's mount peace [Applause] who will be god more peace he this prophet according to malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah the prophet not elijah the prophet coming behold i send you not a man come and say i am the elijah no behold i send you elijah the prophet and he's got a job to do but i am sending him to you because he is going to be my pope peace and out of his mouth will come my word come on simon somebody and man shannon by bread alone but by every word come on now that proceed out of my mouth peace the bible said in his hands have seven stars or seven messengers seven spirits acting reverse the one spirit working on the will of god in different generations so watch he is holding them it didn't say eight stars 92 stars a hundred stars seven stars and a fivefold star it didn't say that it's a seven stars not seven a quarter not seven or eight just seven because there are only seven ages so god just needs seven stars stars means it's night time stars mean they come to shine light in the time attacks that's when stars has come out because it's all dark so he needs times to shine to show us the light for you it shall be light in the evening time come on give the lord some praise as people oh glory to god hallelujah in his right hand you know what right away they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of god the authority of god not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what paul said it takes the authority of god and the power of the holy ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of god in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the holy ghost they all stood up to the world they were full of god they were sent or authorized by god not by self or other men so this is what man said an old man this is god send an old man that's different jesus said here we go this is powerful you got to listen carefully jesus said that when he went away he would send his spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is a world system show me a world system church that is full of the holy ghost i want to see it you will never see it he said if i can show you if you can show me such a church you are finding a mystic in the word not one of these messengers was organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization you hear about the sin of adultery and fornication organizations but there's a sin called the sin of organization where men rule men and men they cater men and men anoint themselves crown themselves lay hands on themselves their hands and others that's denomination that's organization that spirit of man where man bring inspiration for the rest of say the same inspiration that is organizational stuff but these men were different they were hearing direct from god the word of god they brought the revelation of god as god gave it to them they spoke it out man shattered by bread alone but by everybody that proceed out of the mouth of god and god mouth was unfolded through seven ages so two seven ages he had seven men that would release a portion of his word [Applause] oh are you with me on this age he sent william marion branham a 20th century prophet as his mount peace to release to the entire edge every mystery that was sealed from the foundation of the world oh give the lord some praises people are you with me hallelujah and in revelation 10 the mighty angel came in with his book open every mystery reveal every mystery unfolded the book was open it was sealed with seven seals no man could look on it no man could touch it but the lamb died and take the book and lose it on the earth and the prophet was there to catch it because the word of the lord comes to a prophet the word of the lord comes to our prophet the word of the lord written voice word comes to a prophet it must be in the book it must be written that's why i said the seven thunders after a while you're gonna find where it is written [Applause] you might be seated so revelation 10 8 the voice said go to the angel with the book and eat it because you have to live by it man channeling my bread alone but by every word of the open book so once the book is open you can eat it you can't eat the seal book you have to eat the open book and once the mystery is revealed you can eat it because the secret things belong to god but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children that we may do the whole works of the lord so once it's revealed that's ours that's mine give me my mountain come on now church are you getting it are you seeing it to these men either they were put out got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization how can the holy spirit possibly be in an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and the nomination take the place of the word remember organization is dead [Music] if the world takes over the spirit departs here we go yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the true church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had of pentecost by experience it is a pentecostal church there will be tongues interpretations prophecy healings god will be in the midst of her god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has and he will she will be unorganized don't forget that we have some more to say so sit at the edge of your seat and listen carefully now we see that jesus christ is revealing himself through the ages by his spirit in the messengers they are as moses was to the children of israel he had the revelation for his day here we go so each messenger has god's revelation and ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power it is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was standing again among the seven golden alarm stands no it is even enough here we go there's a ton there's a bomb here now is it enough that we see the fivefold ministry of ephesians 4 apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors for in each age the church goes astray but it is not just a laity but the clergy group that bunch so-called fightfolder he said the shepherds are wrong as well as the sheep so when you hear the church go straight it's not just a bunch of laity go on the street it's shepherds and she then god brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth [Applause] or give the lord a praise offering [Applause] [Music] so religious men spiritual men pastor revised them what not the start of god in the world afterwards the backsliding tyrant and they formed church big steeple i always see medini and gordon send some men to bring the word luther wesley columba all and bring the word to them these men bringing light for the age isn't that right isn't something else seven churches set forth if ephesus murder program is for the left lauder he said he had an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the ages to the churches notice here that jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to one person relative to the word for that age here we go are you ready listen to his statement only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say for that age one messenger receive all for the entire age [Applause] [Music] one man in the age receive all for the entire age so the aid stands stretch strands 400 years what he says is this time for 400 years because the word for the entire age one man a man sent from god a man in his right hand one of the seven stars one of the seven voices one of the seven messages one of the seven messengers every single one had the entire revelation of god for the entire age and in the last day every mystery revealed the book opened god sent a 20th century prophet with the entire revelation of the entire age [Applause] oh can we give the lord our worship do you see that now man shall everybody alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of god now watch therefore any man coming after that prophet can only be an echo of what the prophet said no man could bring a further revelation a new revelation a stimulating revelation no additional revelation to what the prophet has brought because the prophet brought the entire [Applause] i feel like dancing when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart and i'm going to dance like david dance [Applause] i'll say it again any man coming after the prophet could only be an echo can it be a messenger can it be another voice it's the same voice it is one voice let me bust on you the spirit only have one voice [Applause] the spirit only have one voice [Applause] and that what's meant that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speak for god by revelation to the churches both true and false the message is broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who here are not getting their own private revelations oh hallelujah glory to god amen hit the ball out the pack hallelujah those who here are not getting their own private revelation nor is the group getting the collective revelation each person is hearing what the messenger has already received from god now give the lord a big shout glory oh this is good this is good this has got you may be seasoned after 110 years somebody want to come and check out noah's service to find out what's new noah comes behind the pulpit i say my scripture for the day is it will rain my word for today is it will rain my subject today as it will rain my inspiration it's still going to rain i am prophesying from what god told me it's going to rain but no i heard you talked that 110 years before he said wait there's a more time coming but it's still going to rain you won't see it yet you ain't feel it yet it didn't interpret yet it's not fulfilled yet but it's coming because once it is spoken it's got to come to pass and the manifestation is the interpretation we don't know man to interpret what the prophet already took it for us we don't need no man's spirit to be loosed among us we reject that we cast that out we challenge that we come against that one messenger for revelation for the entire edge behold i sent you elijah you shall live by the word oh glory hallelujah hallelujah you are going to live by the word itself [Applause] maybe see the what word husband love your wife that's the word [Applause] come on now come on go hold back now wife respect your husband that's the way in other words you can't pick what you want and choose what you like listen to it again man shall not live by bread alone but by some words no known by every word that proceeds out the mouth not man man can say what you want and so men speaking in this last day oh hallelujah listen to this think it not strange paul set this pattern under the hand of god paul alone had the full revelation for his day as evidence yet by his confrontation to the other apostles not believers in him paul was so good he's a person paul had nothing to do with that he smoked peter out openly and ugly but publicly wallet holding back you know because paul you see you see this is what i want i was talking about anthony what does loyalty means to you are we going to talk about lord loyalty i said there's a problem you know people are loyal to church when a man dies a loyal soldier loyal to what the church that's what we don't want loyal soldiers the part of the building the party furniture the dead party church they're not part of god loyal soldier let the mass the flag fly half mass loyal soldier we don't want that we want your commitment to the word if i go off the word run [Applause] i want you to have the word you see once everyone is committed to the word man we are sharp we are mighty army all we want to see the word living no excuses no excuses no excuses [Applause] listen when moses died go to jefferson moses my seven is dead no take the people over god didn't take a microphone and say people and a light shine over joshua and everybody see glory and

gate you can't just go in a situation you have no small plastic door you knocking knock knock can i come in get close certain time open a certain time joshua sends spies to find out what is the temperature of the city he said they're shaking they because they're hearing that the lord is doing things amongst the children's israel they're hearing a move they're hearing a rumbling you see god promised an invincible army that's an army that cannot be defeated that's an army that cannot be stopped and when that army starts to roll you better roll with it or it will crush you you better be part of the shaker or part of the shaking you can't be bought come on now there are some people they are wondering what is happening there are some people they are watching what is happening but there are some people here today that going to cause something to happen i am part of that bunch that causing something to happen because action is caused inertia could just happen oh hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] no it's not that josh i have experience and taken wall cities the quality of jericho he never seen nothing like that that was like a wonderful world at that time and you think joshua frustrates it god tells joshua no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as i went with moses as i was with moses as i was with moses i'm gonna be with you i will not fail

send my messenger before my face he couldn't come be in front of the messenger you have to wait for the messenger to know it's his time to step forward now we have to wait until god give the signal as when to operate and so on so when the seven day walk seven times he shout the shout the wall fell down because they had a loud voice no you think their voice you know god said so so if god says shout you shout it's gonna happen one time brother brandon there was a young woman she had a young wife she had a husband who's to get epilepsy and baram said when he get it jump on him and snatch his shirt and chew it in the fire and say decide in the name of jesus christ she was a tiny woman but when her husband played the dick spirit there's nothing just kidding they're living their lives over here she jump on them because she wants them delivered and she just obey take it off and show it in the fight this side during the name of jesus brother over could you explain that to me no i can't explain that to you i just believe it [Applause] there are many things i can't explain lepers came to jesus he said go and show his head to the priests why did jesus say that why didn't jesus lay hands upon them you'd only hand up on leprosy's people you're still far from that you say go and show yourself to the priest don't even come one step further go and show yourself to the priest along the way they were healed and one came and worshipped and jesus said where are the rest you think he didn't know that's what we're talking about oh my my mind oh could we take a limo are you in the world tomorrow's a holiday no let's settle in and let me drop some bumps inside of here i'm flying over target hallelujah hallelujah want to blow the devil broad unbelief broad negativity so much people negative it's so sad they see life from a negative posture this is going to work out they're not working or they're fed up they're not happy it's sad when that christian is happy i want to share some with you happiness it doesn't consist of the abundance of things some people have abundance things still unhappy and you know what they say one more things they'll learn from that yet no because the devil playing games with your mind this is gonna get you a little happiness they're gonna have some people got a vacation and they're still stressed out because they stress out in their mind so the beast see everything oh it's what time they come because they're stressed inside so when you come to church you come to get distressed stress is like heavy grease in your system you can make it degreased so that you can get the flow of things yes you gotta get come and cover that they could get free those guys they cut branches you know yeah and trees on the ground they were cutting down trees you know god knows where the trees come from god know who you are they're cutting trees from but they were chopping down trees and balling hosea hosanna sorry there was your tree in front there everybody want to be part of the acts then that's when they get involved you want to hail messiah you want to give king lamb worship you want to honor god with your faith you want to show that you are really believer and he is your god because god is the object of worship and when you can worship him by god heaviness people think heaven quiet heaven was only silent for half an hour but i don't know there's a lot of noise you know holy holy lord god almighty isn't that right heaven have a lot of noise you know or whenever crisis are wrong they have to have noise if the people don't worship the rock on the crowd praise god you must be that worshiper jesus said that our command now is where the true worshipers going to worship the father in spirit and in truth well the truth that was lost to seven ages is now open to you then you could truly worship you understand this last age [Applause] glory israel under pressure they want to know what iran will do what america do with the negotiating nuclear stuff they have their bombs ready amen putin have his bombs ready everybody set you know you know who they're waiting on deeper right you waiting to put it no you waited on putin putin waiting on us when we make our move then they may go move ah give me a scripture god came to abraham and said shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do [Applause] dink revelation says stop the wars stop everything until i seal my servants [Applause] forget the outside news come and church and hear the real news glory to god what news the news of the angel from the east having the seal of the living god the seal of god is the holy ghost you'll be seated praise god man amen don't you know the last says there's two marks it's not 27 marks it's not a tattoo all over you it's just two marks it's the seal of god or the mark of the beast and every man who is not named not written gonna worship the beast so if you're not worshiping these who are you worshipping if you're not worshiping god if you're gonna worship the bees all that baloney earth shall worship the beast except those who names written in the lamb's book of life so when you come to service you come to hear your name become the blessed god for your name your name is the catholic your name is that baptist your name is not brandonite your name is that is not your name glory hallelujah hallelujah do you understand that satan went in god's eden and messed things up do you understand god covenant satan eden to give him one last kick i'm excited because the mount of god already spoke words concerning this bride becoming a super church a super race as she nears the headstone actually near as a headstone when you're far from the headstone you are you come on now but as you join in you are not you you you come in more like him in his very image in his very likeness you come in just like him same works same signs same power as you near the headstone oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory [Applause] now watch in every age we have the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger here we go in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught so the messenger brings the light and from that light others draw to preach but of course here we go all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember paul warned the people to say only what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord what came the word of the lord from you or came unto you only they added here they take over there and soon the message is no longer pure the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice here we go for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god even paul said he couldn't change what he had said he said if we or an angel come down from heaven and preach any other thing let him be accused [Applause] paul said i can't change what came out from the mouth of god do you not hear what i'm saying when god spoke to his mouth he can't change it this is real you are going to be delivered [Applause] glory listen to this he didn't he had an alien here with the spirits in the churches in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you are christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word for this age every messenger to every age will preach the word every fresh here we go are you ready every fresh and true revelation will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age the cry of every age is a rebuke you have left the word of god repent come back to the word from the first book in the bible genesis to the last book of revelation there's only one reason for god displeasure that is leaving the word oh blessed be the name of the lord he said these men he said they they were denounced by um by organization now it is not hard to stand up and keep true to a creed it is easy for the devil is right behind all that but it's something else to stay with the true word oh praise god could you what we all i'm going to hit the home stretch now let's look at uh jeremiah chapter 23. you'd have to find it but if you want to read with me i want to read some scripture to show you god's thinking god's thoughts god mine considering pastors concerning sheep let's look at jeremiah chapter 23 we read war beyond to the pastors wow is that real i thought all pastors are lovely men saints of god men of the cloth and god said woe unto the men of the cloth pastors that destroy scattered the sheep of my pasture sea of the lord therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastor to feed my people ye have scattered my flock driven them away have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doing said the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries when i have driven them i will bring them into their forums and they shall be fruitful and increased i will set up shepherds over them that would feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord behold the days come share the lord and i will raise up david a righteous branch and the king shall reign and prosper shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and right and israel shall dwell in safety and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord or righteousness therefore behold the days come say the lord they shall no more say the lord liver which brought up the children of israel or the land of egypt but the lord lived which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country from all countries whether i have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land my heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake i'm like a drunk man like a man whose mind have overcome because the lord because of the lord and because the words of his holiness for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourn it the pleasant place of the wilderness are dried up their course is evil when their force is not right for both prophet and priests are profane yeah in my house i found a wickedness here the lord wherefore their way shall be unto them are slippery ways of darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation that's what people don't know say at the lord i have seen the folly in the prophets of samaria prophets now they prophesy in baal and caused my people israel to earth i have seen the prophets of jerusalem a horrible thing to commit adultery walking lies listen they strengthen the hands of the evildoers that none return from his wickedness the all of them unto me as sodom and an inhabitants of gomorrah therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with one wood and make them drink water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem it's profane it's going forth all the land thus here the lord of hosts listen here we go hack not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say they say still unto them that despise me watch the lord said he shall have peace and they say unto everyone that walketh in the imagination their own heart no evil shall come upon you for who had stood in the conscience of the lord and perceive and heard his word who had marked his word and heard it behold a whirlwind of the lord has gone forth and fury in my grievous world when it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord shall not return until you have executed till they have performed the torts of his heart in the latter days he shall consider it perfectly i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied but if they had stood in my counsel and it caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from the evil ways and from evil doings am i a god at hand saith the lord or a god of heroes can any hide himself in secret places and i shall not see him seared the lord do i not fill heaven on earth see at the lord i have heard that what the prophet said that prophesy lies in my name i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets the prophesy lies yea they are prophets of deceit of their own heart which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which should tell every man to his neighbor as their fathers i forgot my name for their the prophet that had a dream let him tell a dream he said that my word let him speak my word faithfully what is chuffed the wheat saith the lord is not my word like a fire said the lord i like a hammer that break the rock in pieces dear for behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words everyone from his neighbor behold i'm against the prophet saith the lord that used their tongues and said he said behold i'm against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to er by their lies and by their likeness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not prophet these people at all say the lord may god bless his word i read that to you to let you know how god sees things is not as man sees it it's as god sees it we need to get back to the word from the mouth of god because when god speaks it's got to come to pass isn't that right i'm about to close i want to ask you something bro i'm saying joe witness is loyal to what they believe the baptist is loyal to what they believe why can't we be loyal to the word to the word i want to ask you something you say well brother mannam how do you know they are not now if those pharisees and sadducees and leaders of that day museum come please that would have got away from their creeds and their dogmas and listen to what the word said what jesus was telling them just exactly but listen this part they taught so much of their leaders it wasn't batman they wouldn't lie still cost anything like that they wouldn't do that they wouldn't come adultery certainly not they would witness why they were good men but the only thing there was a spiritual man oh hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm closing a momentary consideration of the church history with proof god sent the word in looters day luther spoke for god at that time they organized again pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma increased the not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley he was the voice with the word in that day the people who took his revelation from god became living epistles read alone of all men for their generation when the methodists failed god raised up others so it has gone on through the years until again there's another people in the land who under their messenger that same one messenger will be the final voice to the final age here we go are you ready the church is no longer the more peace of god it is own more peace so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god and look as i close samuel eli rather old priest isn't that right samuel a young man the priest saw all in the message at that time he couldn't have the ability to hear from god so god find this young man samuel begin to speak to him because samuel and his sons were doing evil in sight of god and so on isn't that right and he said no the work has been done he said and today one reason that the church is in the condition it's in is because there are so many voices so many voices attract the church from the voice of god so it's very doubtful that many would even hear the voice of god though it spoke right in the midst the past wouldn't even understand it there are so many voices on the earth today that is absolutely a hard thing because it deadened the voice of the supernatural oh my there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual and in that intellectual condition they even shake nations they are not overnight prisons but they shake nations and it will bring confusion and so forth and their voices raise up and it causes the voice of god to be placed somewhere the truth from the true voice of god and the voice of god they say how will we know is the voice of god because today it wasn't a vindicated prophet now today how do we know is the voice of god are we ready because it's a manifestation of the prophet's word this is god's prophet and a true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god with a supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word that's the voice of god may the lord richly bless you oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god praise god thank you jesus [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen let's all stand on worship as well as steve will come oh glory to god and sing some songs and worship and praise the lord you love him praise god man channeling
