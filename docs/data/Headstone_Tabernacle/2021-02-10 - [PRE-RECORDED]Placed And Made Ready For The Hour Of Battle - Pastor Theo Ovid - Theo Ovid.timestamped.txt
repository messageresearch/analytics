[16:20] morning
[16:21] father come down in our midst and come
[16:24] and speak to our hearts
[16:25] come and confirm your word with signs
[16:27] wonders and miracles
[16:29] we ask in jesus name amen and amen
[16:33] so this morning we understand as we want
[16:35] to go into the word
[16:37] joshua chapter 11
[16:40] matthew chapter 24 ii timothy
[16:44] chapter 3. i want to read from verse 1
[16:47] to 8 of
[16:49] first we read joshua 11 19-23
[16:53] matthew chapter 24 24. god bless you
[16:55] brother collins in the states
[16:57] praise god and all those connected to us
[17:00] we say welcome
[17:02] amen and be blessed amen
[17:19] joshua chapter 11 verse 19
[17:22] there was not a city that made peace
[17:25] with the children of israel
[17:27] save the hivites and the inhabitants of
[17:29] gibeon
[17:30] all other they took in battle
[17:33] for it was of the lord to harden their
[17:37] hearts
[17:38] that they should come against israel in
[17:41] battle
[17:42] that he might destroy them utterly
[17:46] and that they might have no
[17:50] fever but that he might destroy them
[17:54] as the lord commanded moses
[17:58] and at that time came joshua and cut off
[18:00] the anakims from the mountains
[18:02] from hebron from dbu from anab
[18:05] from all the mountains of judah from all
[18:08] the mountains of israel
[18:09] joshua destroyed them utterly with their
[18:11] cities
[18:13] there was none of the anakin's left in
[18:16] the land of the children of israel
[18:18] only in gaza and ghat and ashda they
[18:22] remained
[18:23] so joshua took the whole land
[18:28] according to all that the lord said unto
[18:30] moses
[18:32] and joshua give it for an inheritance
[18:34] unto israel
[18:35] according to the divisions by tribes
[18:39] and the land rested from war
[18:44] matthew 24 verse 24
[18:48] for there shall arise false christs
[18:51] false prophets
[18:53] and shall show great signs and wonders
[18:55] it's so much
[18:56] that if it were possible they would
[18:59] deceive
[19:00] the very elect second timothy chapter 3
[19:04] verse 1 this also
[19:08] this know also that in the last days
[19:11] perilous times shall come for men
[19:14] shall be lovers of their own selves
[19:17] covetous
[19:19] boasters proud blasphemers disobedience
[19:22] to parents
[19:24] unthankful unholy without natural
[19:27] affection truth breakers false
[19:31] accusers incontinent fierce
[19:35] despisers of those that are good
[19:38] traitors
[19:38] heady high-minded lovers of pleasures
[19:42] more than lovers of god
[19:44] having a form of godliness but denying
[19:48] the power thereof from such turn away
[19:51] for
[19:52] this is the sort
[19:55] for of this sort a day which creep into
[19:57] houses and lead captive silly woman
[19:59] laden with sins led away by divers lust
[20:02] ever learning
[20:03] never able to come to the knowledge of
[20:06] the truth
[20:07] now as janice and jambres which stood
[20:10] moses
[20:11] so these men resist
[20:15] the truth men of corrupt minds
[20:19] reprobate considering the faith
[20:22] let's pray father we thank you for your
[20:24] word we thank you for sending our
[20:26] elijah prophet with eagle eyes to look
[20:29] deep down into the age
[20:31] to speak to us in prophecy of the times
[20:34] and seasons that we're living in
[20:36] and how as we see signs all around us
[20:39] lord we want to
[20:40] wrap ourselves in the gown of the
[20:42] promised world
[20:43] waiting for your coming because we know
[20:46] dynamics is about a strike
[20:48] to start this great battle have your own
[20:51] way amongst us we pray
[20:53] in jesus name i ask it amen and amen
[20:56] you may be seated blessed be the name of
[20:58] the lord
[21:00] our title this morning placed
[21:03] and made ready for the hour of battle
[21:07] pleased and made ready
[21:11] for the hour of battle
[21:14] another inspiration it takes a word
[21:17] bride
[21:18] to defeat the enemy a word
[21:22] bride to defeat the enemy oh blessed be
[21:25] the name of the lord
[21:26] you love him this morning i'm looking
[21:29] forward for god to really
[21:30] bless us in the word this morning oh
[21:32] praise god these are some things that
[21:33] god put upon my heart
[21:35] that i want to share with you and this
[21:36] evening are some things upon my heart
[21:38] also
[21:39] praise god it's so strange how you get
[21:42] inspiration and messages
[21:43] assuming i wanted to preach this morning
[21:44] i just couldn't get to it and this is
[21:46] what was given so i have to just do what
[21:48] i've been given you know
[21:50] what is this address but i know that god
[21:52] going to speak to us
[21:54] because we are speaking the word
[21:57] from the wheat our fellowship god
[21:58] intended this fellowship
[22:00] so what separated what keeps man from
[22:02] having that direct talk like adam did
[22:05] i've often taught that adam out in the
[22:07] garden of eden knowing no sin
[22:09] eve is white beautiful leo the lion
[22:11] would come up
[22:12] tiger great beasts of the field even the
[22:15] beast didn't have killing about them
[22:16] there was no death nowhere here we go
[22:20] the devil is what make wild animal wants
[22:23] to hurt you
[22:25] here we go listen if you can produce in
[22:28] your heart
[22:30] the right kind of a love towards the
[22:33] most horrible beast there is in the
[22:35] woods
[22:36] or the desert that beast won't harm you
[22:39] i know it by experience but you can't
[22:42] pretend it he knows whether you do or
[22:45] not
[22:46] the beast knows so you can say i fear
[22:50] not
[22:50] no no no the beast knows
[22:54] he wouldn't answer you he will bite you
[22:57] he knows now watch
[23:00] you can't pretend it he knows whether
[23:03] you do or not
[23:05] there is something about him that he
[23:07] knows it
[23:08] but if you're really not afraid i have
[23:10] never seen anything will hurt you no
[23:12] matter a lion
[23:13] whatever it might be he will walk away
[23:16] from you
[23:17] but if you run or act like you're scared
[23:19] then you'll get killed
[23:21] so you can't make it up you've got to
[23:24] really know it in your heart you're not
[23:26] afraid
[23:28] oh glory hallelujah
[23:31] so this litmus test this intellectual
[23:35] preaching and books and tapes to face
[23:38] the lion
[23:39] and the bee and whatnot that's a
[23:41] different thing altogether it has to
[23:43] have something on the inside
[23:45] because the lion will know that's why
[23:48] you said the virtues you wouldn't have
[23:49] to fight
[23:50] up the devil make you proof
[23:52] [Applause]
[23:53] every one of them hallelujah
[23:57] you wouldn't have to put a red flag to
[23:59] say you have this and you are distant
[24:01] show your muscles you don't have to do
[24:03] that
[24:03] god going to arrange the test it's
[24:05] coming that these things could come out
[24:07] of you
[24:08] to manifest itself give the lord a
[24:10] shadow back now
[24:12] faith gonna come out first you're gonna
[24:14] come out
[24:15] knowledge gonna come out what about
[24:17] temperance what about patience
[24:19] what about godliness what about
[24:21] brotherly kindness what about the love
[24:23] of god it's got to come out
[24:25] and god has to create the environment
[24:27] for these things to come out
[24:29] the test for these things to pull
[24:30] outside of you
[24:32] oh hallelujah so god sent two people in
[24:34] the church making love
[24:36] and but around begging them stop it stop
[24:38] it stop it all of a sudden the spirit
[24:40] drop down
[24:42] whatever you say they say blind they'll
[24:43] be blind they said they'll die
[24:45] all of a sudden you see no one happened
[24:47] god is testing him
[24:48] god is creating an environment to see
[24:50] what he will do all of a sudden he said
[24:52] i forgive you
[24:54] and the holy spirit fell because the
[24:56] holy spirit was pleased
[24:57] this is not my mother's son he's acting
[25:00] like his father
[25:01] oh glory to god he's acting like god
[25:04] isn't that right he releasing
[25:06] forgiveness
[25:07] oh hallelujah he do have this
[25:10] self-righteous indignation
[25:11] against him oh hallelujah he's not
[25:14] self-righteous isn't that right
[25:16] oh blessed are you with me this morning
[25:20] amen amen
[25:24] that's the trouble with man tonight
[25:26] that's what the trouble with people
[25:26] tonight you're scared
[25:29] that's the biggest curse of the full
[25:30] gospel people or any other people
[25:33] is because they're afraid god has made
[25:36] the provision
[25:37] but you are afraid to take his word for
[25:40] it
[25:41] if you wasn't afraid tonight you would
[25:43] take your healing
[25:44] and know that god promised it and that
[25:47] thing will go plumb away from you
[25:49] i have noticed and that's the reason i'm
[25:51] such a believer in healing
[25:52] i know if you can get away from the
[25:55] scare
[25:56] and get love in this place something is
[25:58] going to happen
[26:01] so the prophet was trying to bring
[26:03] certain principles that people could
[26:05] access
[26:06] their redemptive rights amen
[26:10] amen because you have rights but as if
[26:13] you want to access it
[26:14] we talk about kingdom and citizenship
[26:17] and so on
[26:17] and if it have the ambulance if it have
[26:20] facilities that the government have
[26:22] it's there our citizen is your right to
[26:24] access it
[26:25] it's if you want to access it it's up to
[26:27] you well healing is there
[26:30] deliverance is there breakthrough is
[26:32] there
[26:33] victory is there what about joy is there
[26:36] get back your prayer life it's also
[26:38] there you don't have to be
[26:40] dumb and dull and depressed no
[26:42] overcoming it's there also
[26:49] now we talk about kingdom and sizzling
[26:51] and king but i have more news for you
[26:53] you're not even a citizen you are son of
[26:56] the king
[26:59] you are sons and daughters of the king
[27:02] hallelujah hallelujah dear lord i get
[27:05] the glory on that
[27:10] and you come to church to hear about
[27:12] your royalty they come to church to hear
[27:14] about your inheritance
[27:15] you may be seated praise god hallelujah
[27:18] hallelujah oh glory to god
[27:21] calculation says a child even though
[27:23] he's a heir remain under tutors and
[27:26] governors
[27:26] until the time appointed by the father
[27:29] so you don't know all things
[27:31] as a young child they have to get a
[27:33] tutor to get some history
[27:35] when your father owns all of this
[27:39] [Music]
[27:40] and you are the heir and you are a son
[27:44] and you have to walk right you have to
[27:46] talk right you have to act
[27:48] right because you have to sit on his
[27:50] throne
[27:51] come on team and somebody no you have to
[27:54] learn
[27:54] several languages no you have to go to
[27:57] class
[27:58] no you have to look at equations
[27:59] behavior and attitude and so on
[28:02] because when you walk instead of the
[28:04] king's son coming when you walk like the
[28:06] king daughter is coming
[28:08] you are not just ordinary angels have to
[28:10] escort
[28:11] have to go in front of you because of
[28:13] who you are
[28:15] come and see him and somebody oh
[28:18] hallelujah hallelujah so god
[28:22] have to transform your mind into
[28:24] kingship
[28:26] into headship into a consciousness
[28:29] that you come from god and you're going
[28:31] back to god
[28:32] and no weapon form against you could
[28:34] prosper
[28:35] so when you walk you walk fearless
[28:38] you're not walking as scared and afraid

[28:42] of the shadow of death

[43:00] the good fight of faith
[43:02] but you're going to find out what this
[43:03] battle is about second peter 147
[43:06] at your feet virtue knowledge temperance
[43:11] patience godliness badly kindness
[43:14] and charity that's the brain
[43:24] that's the bride
[43:28] watch her nature watch her behavior
[43:32] notice i didn't see teaching yet
[43:36] i'm talking about nature because the
[43:38] script we read in second
[43:40] timothy talk about a different nature
[43:43] heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures
[43:47] more than lovers of god
[43:49] haters these are not unbelievers
[43:53] this is church people yes these are
[43:56] people who
[43:57] christians want to be
[44:01] matthew 24 false prophet these are the
[44:04] fivefold on the other side
[44:07] and second timothy is the church members
[44:10] of the church of these
[44:11] so-called fifo on the matthew 24 24
[44:16] false anointed ones they're going to
[44:18] release on the earth
[44:20] demonic activity that will cause the
[44:22] people to behave like that
[44:25] heavy high-minded posters
[44:29] that is the spirit of the church do you
[44:32] want that
[44:33] but the spirit of the bride is fit
[44:35] virtue
[44:37] knowledge temperance patience
[44:40] guardiness you have to live something
[44:43] that's the thunder
[44:44] [Applause]
[44:47] that's
[44:51] not the doctrine it never was doctrine
[44:56] it was always the spirit the life
[45:00] and i could prove it because in the
[45:02] beginning was the word but before the
[45:04] beginning
[45:06] [Music]
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:08] was the spirit what give the lord a
[45:10] shall they pray
[45:12] in the beginning what's the word but
[45:15] before the beginning what spirit
[45:18] so the word only come in the beginning
[45:20] and satan was created in the beginning
[45:22] but we were before the beginning
[45:26] therefore we have to reconnect back to
[45:28] the original
[45:30] which was before oh hallelujah so when
[45:32] you connect back to the attribute gene
[45:35] thought spirit of before no demon could
[45:38] stop you
[45:39] and trouble you oh glory to god amen
[45:43] hallelujah you believe that so there are
[45:46] two
[45:46] faculties that govern the human one of
[45:49] them is fate would bring results
[45:51] the other is fear which has no value
[45:55] in it at all faith is of god
[45:59] fears of the devil fear makes you wary
[46:03] fear makes you wonder amen
[46:07] if i'm going to die in the morning what
[46:08] god will do to me to get chewed up about
[46:09] it
[46:11] what are you going to worry about what

[46:55] forget about this not even your child
[46:57] god give you a loan praise god forget

[47:17] and tips
[47:18] no no it's more than that oh glory to
[47:21] god hallelujah
[47:23] hallelujah so i was thinking about it
[47:26] i was thinking you know like a job i
[47:28] have a job
[47:29] and the job qualification is a master's
[47:31] degree or degree or subject or whatever
[47:33] it is
[47:33] i have 20 people with the same
[47:35] qualifications
[47:37] but there's something called an
[47:38] interview
[47:40] to separate who you want from who you
[47:42] don't want
[47:44] so all the books and tapes everybody
[47:45] have them
[47:49] everybody listen to brother branham
[47:51] listen to books and taste but you have
[47:52] an interview
[47:54] they have certain things they look for
[47:57] in the interview
[47:58] and i got a document i wanted to share
[48:00] something with you can the candidates do
[48:02] the job
[48:03] will the candidate fit into the
[48:04] company's culture is it the best
[48:07] candidate
[48:08] for the position my my mind
[48:12] so the interviewee is awarded a score if
[48:15] they have demonstrated full
[48:16] mastery or did not demonstrate the
[48:18] ability to be competent in
[48:20] every area customer relations
[48:22] communications
[48:24] i hear this one self management
[48:27] management of oneself the taking of
[48:31] responsibility
[48:32] for one's own behavior and well-being
[48:34] there are some people
[48:35] love to blame is she is he come like a
[48:38] little girl

[48:58] professional skill
[48:59] organizational awareness business acumen
[49:02] team
[49:02] work and leadership this part is
[49:05] interesting
[49:06] the interviewer is trained to pick up
[49:08] the following before and during the
[49:10] interview
[49:11] these are some of the reasons a person
[49:13] can be passed over for a job
[49:15] late to the interview
[49:18] lack of manners lack of confidence
[49:21] theoretic eye contact
[49:22] sloppy appearance inability to express

[50:39] employers i like that one
[50:41] but i was working for what is it so
[50:43] wicked
[50:45] and only by talking all the employers
[50:47] there before well that company will know
[50:49] if they believe here they go back to us
[50:51] too we don't want that
[50:53] so you have to have the control i'll
[50:55] just give you some tips here
[50:56] or this will work for you who will for
[50:58] interview maybe this week i don't know
[51:02] indefinite response to questions lazy
[51:05] oh how do you see that boy interview how
[51:08] long have you ever last i don't even
[51:09] know
[51:10] but they could pick up a lazy spirit
[51:11] afterwards the interviews be sharper
[51:13] they could pick up people right away and
[51:14] another one another one another one a
[51:16] treat to determine out of
[51:18] all right indecision doesn't seem
[51:21] honest and direct when giving answers to
[51:23] questions
[51:24] we listen to what is said but most
[51:26] importantly what is not said
[51:29] so sometimes they ask you where you fit
[51:31] in the family i don't know where the
[51:33] governor
[51:34] you stand the middle child all right and
[51:36] then it acts about the first child on
[51:38] the second side but they have an
[51:39] objective behind that to see what you're
[51:41] going to how you respond to that
[51:42] lack of the lack of direction and career
[51:45] merely shopping around in tolerance
[51:47] inability to take criticism
[51:52] some people don't like you to tell them
[51:54] nothing
[51:55] just leave me as i am you want me to job
[51:58] or you don't want me
[51:59] we don't want you it's that simple
[52:02] you have to be able to take criticism
[52:05] criticism is
[52:06] healthy
[52:09] [Music]
[52:10] let let criticism be a motivation for
[52:13] you
[52:14] for you to do better for you to improve
[52:15] you don't want to be good you want to be
[52:17] perfect come on now
[52:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[52:22] and once an employee is selected to fill
[52:24] a vacancy they have a probationary
[52:25] period
[52:26] four to say six months and then
[52:28] depending upon given
[52:29] so that probationary period now is to
[52:32] see if there are hidden things they
[52:33] didn't pick up
[52:34] in the interview that you will manifest
[52:36] in that four to six months
[52:37] so you interview early by your late bird
[52:39] because you see yourself as a late bird
[52:41] you're late you're born late whatever
[52:43] that was from services like you're born
[52:44] late
[52:45] he's always coming late late is his
[52:47] thing
[52:48] you know what i mean you know what
[52:49] brother actually said that that's why he
[52:51] is late
[52:52] so you know he feels a natural thing
[52:54] he's a bit it's a placement of late
[52:57] but but but but but that's not true it's
[52:59] a late spirit on them
[53:01] because all you have to do is to get two
[53:03] hours up early and then get here on time
[53:05] and then you could shout and feel
[53:07] comfortable
[53:08] to be in the spirit because you come
[53:09] here to get your battery charged
[53:11] you don't want your battery hour charge
[53:12] you ever plug in your phone in your
[53:14] phone get a little charging going out
[53:15] how stressful that is because you know
[53:17] your phone gonna conk out
[53:18] you want a fully charged phone so when
[53:21] you leave here you don't want your
[53:22] battery quarter charge
[53:23] never slap you up monday morning you're
[53:25] looking for a recharge and all kind of
[53:27] things like that
[53:27] you coming for a full charge this
[53:29] morning this charge should take you to
[53:30] the next service
[53:31] and the next service until it until you
[53:34] become the very battery itself
[53:36] you don't even need her to be charged
[53:38] you have the charger
[53:40] you walking with the charger come on
[53:42] same as somebody
[53:44] hallelujah hallelujah you come here to
[53:47] plug in this morning or
[53:48] plug in you're plugging in something the
[53:50] current goal you can get a good charge
[53:52] but once you are here make sure you get
[53:53] the battery charger
[53:55] don't we don't go we have plenty calls
[53:57] to make this week you can't let that
[53:59] cell phone run out
[54:00] they can't let god phone run out come on
[54:02] say hi man somebody

[54:11] you better tell him what you want oh
[54:14] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[54:17] name of the lord
[54:19] what am i saying i'm saying the dynamics
[54:21] is about to break
[54:23] or forth the dynamics break for the
[54:24] battle now begins
[54:26] it's like food whistle blow battle no
[54:28] start
[54:29] hallelujah drama no start here come the
[54:33] true anointed ones
[54:34] because brother branham said they will
[54:36] be anointed first
[54:38] i'm not hearing you the true anointed
[54:40] comes forth
[54:42] the true anointed comes forth and then
[54:44] afterwards the others get the anointing
[54:46] after because the original dollar has to
[54:49] be first
[54:50] but they make some photocopies of it or
[54:52] for that they counterfeit it
[54:54] but they got to have an original that
[54:56] they could copy after
[54:58] so god have to bring a space between the
[55:01] bride
[55:02] and the false between the true and the
[55:04] force and that's what he's gonna do
[55:06] bring the anointing upon the bride
[55:08] because the spirit have to anoint the
[55:10] bride

[55:14] spirit and the bride say come
[55:16] oh you told me that anointing gonna
[55:17] strike the earth oh look at pepper
[55:19] francis
[55:20] pope francis gone then america swooning
[55:22] over him almost fainting

[55:49] baby was a girl

[55:56] and kissed the baby and so on and then
[55:58] you poke mobile and every smile is
[55:59] anything

[56:02] man
[56:03] wandering after this beast saying do
[56:06] this
[56:07] do that do the other first time the man
[56:10] stepped in united nations
[56:12] said the devil is going to come down the
[56:14] united nations to anoint them
[56:16] with their dynamics and he is speaking
[56:19] not just as a religious head
[56:21] but as also a head of a state because
[56:23] the vatican is also a state
[56:25] speaking as a politician it's political
[56:27] demon and religious power a triuncard
[56:31] you have a three-stage ministry false

[56:44] hour of battle
[56:46] that lays just ahead of us this is no
[56:49] game
[56:50] perilous time shall condition no blame
[56:52] people have been deceived outright
[56:55] the bible said all that dwell on the
[56:57] earth shall worship the beast
[56:58] whose names are not written in the
[57:00] lamb's book of the life that's why you
[57:02] should bless
[57:03] god god send a prophet messenger to
[57:06] bring
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:10] clarity
[57:13] hallelujah all these preachers hiding
[57:16] with false doctrine
[57:17] hiding it on the hidden mysteries bunch
[57:20] of foolishness
[57:21] when god tell habakkuk right division

[58:08] after his ministry
[58:10] res in his resurrection ministry he came
[58:13] amongst them
[58:14] to open their understanding and to make
[58:17] play in the scriptures

[58:24] they were looking for
[58:26] they knew what to expect nobody would
[58:29] come and teach them
[58:30] and explain to them and reveal anything

[1:13:48] you know when i come into church today
[1:13:50] something come to me
[1:13:50] the whole object of ministering and
[1:13:52] preaching is to get out of the way
[1:13:54] i don't have to have a certain message
[1:13:55] and you know have certain things but the
[1:13:57] objective could god get this man out of
[1:14:00] the way
[1:14:01] that he could minister to the people
[1:14:03] that speak and get the needs
[1:14:05] met could we see that
[1:14:08] could we expect that that we said that
[1:14:11] we have to say this and say that and i'm
[1:14:13] trying to say this here
[1:14:14] is that god could take that man out of
[1:14:16] the way
[1:14:17] what would peter know what to preach
[1:14:18] when he went to cornelia's house he was
[1:14:20] just speaking testifying
[1:14:22] witnessing and why he spit these words
[1:14:25] the holy ghost fell upon them that
[1:14:28] heard the word why he was speaking the
[1:14:31] word
[1:14:32] he wasn't in charge he was
[1:14:35] an ambassador of the kingdom oh
[1:14:38] hallelujah he had the words
[1:14:40] from the king and when he was speaking
[1:14:42] the word of fire
[1:14:44] from the king fell upon the people peter
[1:14:46] was stunned
[1:14:47] because he recognized this holy ghost
[1:14:48] thing it's not only for the jews
[1:14:50] it's also for the gentiles come on same
[1:14:53] as somebody
[1:14:55] and we have a holy ghost thing
[1:15:01] it's holy ghost this holy ghost is not
[1:15:04] for the foolish version
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:08] that some people like to study late when
[1:15:10] they have exams
[1:15:12] whole year they're not studying two days
[1:15:13] before they cram in the cramming
[1:15:14] cramming to pass
[1:15:16] don't do that with the oil in them
[1:15:20] don't go for last minute oil

[1:15:27] but the spirit is the word get the word
[1:15:30] now
[1:15:31] wake up when the world and the spirit
[1:15:32] your bottle your oil falling over
[1:15:34] you have extra because you take the word

[1:15:45] that
[1:15:46] how many believe that that the word is
[1:15:48] inside of you
[1:15:56] tough times ahead hard times and it's
[1:15:58] time to be locking with the word

[1:16:02] maturity and then he could descript it
[1:16:03] when i was a child i speak like a child
[1:16:05] honestly the child
[1:16:06] and i like this part when i became a man
[1:16:10] i had just become a man because you

[1:26:58] and just say which one was righteous

[1:27:46] the devil

[1:28:42] i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you
[1:28:44] that's why the true hebrew boys are so
[1:28:46] powerful
[1:28:46] this is what god is able to deliver us
[1:28:48] but if he doesn't deliver us
[1:28:50] we still will not bow down oh hallelujah
[1:28:53] they will rock on their own testimony
[1:28:55] they rock back on their own faith they
[1:28:56] were fearless
[1:28:58] but abraham said wormwood wanted to come
[1:29:00] now and pour water
[1:29:01] and what the angel for water want to out
[1:29:03] the fire god said no no no no i don't

[1:29:10] no angel going down to join the young
[1:29:12] guys i want to shake their hand
[1:29:14] for their faith and their testimony
[1:29:16] amidst fiery trials

[1:29:26] child god want to come now because
[1:29:29] of your faith and your testimony i won't

[1:29:42] hallelujah praise peter jesus it's going
[1:29:45] to be the virtues
[1:29:46] versus every other thing every other
[1:29:49] pure spirit of faith
[1:29:51] and red and orange and green and all the
[1:29:54] virtues all the colors
[1:29:56] it could be that pure color that gonna
[1:29:57] be christ christ in the form of
[1:30:00] evangelist christ in the form of a
[1:30:02] pastor christ
[1:30:03] in the form of apostle christ we have to
[1:30:05] see christ christ have to be in these
[1:30:07] men
[1:30:08] that is why there's a fifo ministry yet
[1:30:11] as much as people want to say it have it
[1:30:12] now
[1:30:13] that's not true it takes dynamics to
[1:30:15] produce
[1:30:16] a fifo ministry it take the interview
[1:30:22] because that is god's selection but
[1:30:24] abraham said when the son is born
[1:30:25] the holy spirit is sent as a tutor and
[1:30:28] the holy spirit here we go
[1:30:29] reports to the father your behavior
[1:30:32] not the doctrine your behavior so based
[1:30:35] upon your behavior
[1:30:36] how is he coming along father asked the
[1:30:38] question he's like a chip off the old
[1:30:40] block
[1:30:42] then the holy spirit the father said
[1:30:43] give him some more years
[1:30:46] not some more days drop some years on
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:50] you see because time disproves a lot of
[1:30:52] things
[1:30:57] young people jump up and say they
[1:30:58] believe after 10 years
[1:31:00] they believe not
[1:31:05] so god is through time hallelujah
[1:31:09] put time over things and see how you
[1:31:12] make out
[1:31:13] see how you mature show your right and
[1:31:15] sell your girl
[1:31:16] in a youthful day just say things they
[1:31:18] should not not to say act away or
[1:31:20] to act as they grow mature you get more
[1:31:22] sense
[1:31:23] get more wisdom at least you're supposed
[1:31:24] to
[1:31:26] some do some don't at least you're
[1:31:28] supposed to if you don't well you're in
[1:31:30] trouble
[1:31:30] because let him that lack wisdom ask god
[1:31:33] who give it
[1:31:34] liberally i don't know why people are
[1:31:36] asking god for things
[1:31:37] ask for great things acts of big things
[1:31:41] i don't know why people just chinks and
[1:31:42] jinxing
[1:31:43] that come like say a mouse in egypt
[1:31:45] taking one grain at a time and say you
[1:31:47] think i should
[1:31:48] think i should eat some more i have a
[1:31:50] whole
[1:31:51] big thing and the most chinks and chicks
[1:31:52] do chings you got plenty food
[1:31:55] amen hallelujah eat and be satisfied
[1:32:00] eat and be filled with plenty people
[1:32:03] just want a little drip let your cup run
[1:32:04] over and ask god
[1:32:06] stop asking for blessings and the things
[1:32:09] in your glass say god
[1:32:10] let my cup run over
[1:32:12] [Applause]
[1:32:15] some people are so selfish all they want
[1:32:16] is for the self all they see is about
[1:32:18] themselves that's
[1:32:18] all because you feel that
[1:32:23] you would you would lose see look in
[1:32:25] this stuck up
[1:32:26] you feel you wouldn't have
[1:32:29] but when you're coming to your
[1:32:30] selflessness and to serve god you give
[1:32:32] and god could put your cup to run over
[1:32:34] so much that you have so much so much
[1:32:36] more than you have
[1:32:37] that you could afford to share with
[1:32:38] whoever you want and begin to give and
[1:32:40] the more you give is the more god give
[1:32:41] you
[1:32:42] because god love a giver
[1:32:45] god loves a giver and he gives you that
[1:32:47] you could give others because you can't
[1:32:48] give what you don't have
[1:32:50] god i have to give you that you can give

[1:40:21] ages fought for truth fought for truth

[1:40:26] sanctification
[1:40:27] we got to do the same thing oh
[1:40:29] hallelujah
[1:40:30] praise god look at mystery babylon
[1:40:33] leading people by denominations
[1:40:34] with a cup of iniquity of man-made
[1:40:36] doctrine pulling them away from the
[1:40:38] fountain filled with blood
[1:40:39] where the power of almighty god was free
[1:40:41] to manifest jesus christ
[1:40:42] that's true but he will come when he
[1:40:45] comes when that come to pass the word is
[1:40:46] finished
[1:40:47] there's only one thing left another
[1:40:49] seven thunders we don't know but it
[1:40:51] would not have thundered in vain
[1:40:52] go on don't do something just to be
[1:40:54] plain we play and act silly
[1:40:56] but not god everything with god is a and
[1:40:58] a he doesn't just fool
[1:41:00] he doesn't kid he means what he says and
[1:41:02] seven thunders right in the revelation
[1:41:04] of jesus christ is some mystery
[1:41:05] does not the bible says the revelation
[1:41:07] of jesus christ there is some
[1:41:09] hidden mystery then of it what is it the
[1:41:11] seven thunders have it
[1:41:12] for john was about to write and he said
[1:41:14] don't write it put it in the box of the
[1:41:15] book
[1:41:16] it's got to be revealed it's the
[1:41:18] mysteries these little organizations i
[1:41:21] think
[1:41:21] i think god has been in it the whole
[1:41:23] thing but because we are different each
[1:41:25] man sees different each person sees
[1:41:27] different no two minds is exactly the
[1:41:28] same
[1:41:29] no two people is exactly the same no two
[1:41:32] noses no two thumbprints we are made
[1:41:34] different
[1:41:34] we should have different groups we
[1:41:37] should have
[1:41:38] different groups god always work with an
[1:41:42] individual
[1:41:43] he don't save you because you're
[1:41:45] methodist he doesn't save you because
[1:41:47] you're baptist
[1:41:47] he doesn't save you because you're
[1:41:48] pentecostal he saves you because he has
[1:41:50] dealt personally with you
[1:41:52] and you are saved on that basis and you
[1:41:54] have accepted it so therefore god could
[1:41:56] deal with you
[1:41:57] he doesn't deal with you in the order of
[1:41:59] his church he deal with you
[1:42:01] as an individual therefore when god sent
[1:42:04] forth prophets
[1:42:05] his messenger of the testament he spoke
[1:42:07] to one man
[1:42:09] and that man had to bring the message
[1:42:11] others
[1:42:12] went from him everywhere
[1:42:15] bringing the same message but they had
[1:42:18] to have one headquarters
[1:42:20] god has always had it i'm thankful he
[1:42:23] has got it tonight
[1:42:24] and that's the holy ghost
[1:42:28] the headquarters is what the holy ghost
[1:42:30] not some group
[1:42:32] amen but the holy spirit is god
[1:42:35] headquarters
[1:42:37] that is god's messenger of the hour like
[1:42:39] some ministers feel like co-pilot
[1:42:41] because some brother want people to
[1:42:43] connect to them him
[1:42:44] and if they're not connected to him
[1:42:46] you're not in the bride and by
[1:42:48] that connection they're screwing up the
[1:42:49] sovereignty of the local church
[1:42:52] and the people having less respect for
[1:42:53] their own local minister because they
[1:42:54] believe connecting to this brother or
[1:42:56] whoever brother is connecting to the
[1:42:58] bride and the faithful ministry which is
[1:43:00] foolishness
[1:43:00] amen but abraham said that he didn't did
[1:43:02] not say that
[1:43:03] he said we are we are desperate as
[1:43:05] individuals we should have different
[1:43:07] groups isn't that right
[1:43:08] and the holy spirit is god headquarters
[1:43:11] that's god
[1:43:12] messenger we are so we're not supposed
[1:43:14] to be hearing horizontally from this
[1:43:16] minister
[1:43:16] and this church no we suppose he ain't
[1:43:18] vertically coming from heaven coming
[1:43:20] from above and as we hear from god we
[1:43:22] give it out to the people
[1:43:24] flesh and blood had not revealed it unto
[1:43:25] you but my father had revealed it
[1:43:27] upon you isn't that right hallelujah
[1:43:30] glory to god but abram is it true that
[1:43:33] every jew born since christ shall be
[1:43:35] saved
[1:43:37] no nothing will be saved only those
[1:43:41] whose names are put on the line book of
[1:43:42] life
[1:43:43] jew or gentiles the book holds the
[1:43:45] mystery and the book is only unfolding
[1:43:47] it now
[1:43:48] not each one's name but what the mystery
[1:43:50] of the book is
[1:43:51] while it is calling its names the book
[1:43:53] doesn't say level is to be saved or omar
[1:43:55] neville
[1:43:55] it just shows the mystery and we by
[1:43:57] faith believe it i want to finish
[1:43:59] get to this year then i'll wrap up from
[1:44:01] the fourth seal
[1:44:03] we had in coming last night the great
[1:44:04] sword we find out he gets and killed
[1:44:06] with the sword too
[1:44:08] he said wait till them seven thunders
[1:44:10] utter the voices of that group
[1:44:12] who can really take the word of god and
[1:44:14] hand the deal
[1:44:15] it will slice and cut they can close the
[1:44:17] heavens they can shut this do whatever i
[1:44:18] want to do
[1:44:19] he will be slayed by the word that
[1:44:21] proceeds from his mouth it's sharper
[1:44:23] than a twitch sword
[1:44:24] they call for a hundred billion tons of
[1:44:25] flies if they wanted to whatever they
[1:44:27] say is going to happen
[1:44:28] god uses man here we go listen to this
[1:44:31] now we find out this satan after being
[1:44:35] kicked out of heaven
[1:44:36] incarnates himself in the beast
[1:44:39] no he's a beast antichrist
[1:44:42] false prophet no beast and given the
[1:44:46] name of death
[1:44:46] and hell follows him fully satan on his
[1:44:49] throne
[1:44:50] he is satan's representative on the
[1:44:53] earth
[1:44:54] he is now head of the kingdoms of the
[1:44:56] world
[1:44:58] the very same kingdoms he offered the
[1:45:00] lord jesus in matthew 4
[1:45:02] satan now becomes full king now this
[1:45:05] happens later on
[1:45:07] listen to the prophet he is false
[1:45:09] prophet now
[1:45:10] he will become beast after a while
[1:45:14] when he breaks the covenant with the
[1:45:16] jews
[1:45:18] notice he will be given a heart
[1:45:21] of a beast at that time and satan will
[1:45:25] incarnate himself
[1:45:26] because when the church goes up satan is
[1:45:28] cast down
[1:45:30] so that is for the tribulation and that
[1:45:31] is for the remnant
[1:45:33] of the people who miss the bride they're
[1:45:36] going to be facing that beast system
[1:45:38] so the nice man is nice now but at that
[1:45:41] time
[1:45:41] he'd be given a heart of a beast
[1:45:45] oh hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:45:48] and i am thinking that the great enemy
[1:45:51] of the christian society today
[1:45:53] is organized churches amen i do believe
[1:45:56] in all my heart
[1:45:57] it will finally form me to the mark of
[1:45:58] the beast which i can think and prove
[1:46:00] you see once this is organized it's
[1:46:02] human hand in it
[1:46:05] it's not spirit covenant then the
[1:46:08] ministers can't preach what they feel
[1:46:09] like to preach
[1:46:10] they have to preach what despite to them
[1:46:13] so some man telling them what the
[1:46:14] inspiration is
[1:46:15] what they should say what they shouldn't
[1:46:17] say what they should preach
[1:46:18] what they shouldn't preach that is human
[1:46:21] so man is no longer led by the spirit
[1:46:23] he is led by another human who thinks
[1:46:26] he's some king somewhere
[1:46:29] so watch every time that man made an
[1:46:33] organization
[1:46:34] the spirit of god left it never did
[1:46:36] return
[1:46:38] it grown in members but never now
[1:46:40] weakness in the spirit
[1:46:42] the battle started in heaven but it will
[1:46:44] be finished on earth
[1:46:45] in the form of armageddon now let's
[1:46:48] watch it unfold here we go
[1:46:50] this mysterious rider this is the pilot
[1:46:52] rider 14.
[1:46:54] opposes refuse to repent
[1:46:58] and go back to the original blood word
[1:47:02] amen the word become blood and flesh
[1:47:06] he refused to go back to it it is
[1:47:08] antichrist
[1:47:10] the true word bride he opposed the true
[1:47:13] word bride
[1:47:14] takes his own bride he takes his own
[1:47:17] bride
[1:47:18] and brings her to him in the form of
[1:47:19] religion called creeds and dogmas
[1:47:22] and now seeing the holy bride he's
[1:47:24] against her he forms his own bride
[1:47:26] called antichrist by antichrist teaching
[1:47:28] which is contrary to christ notice
[1:47:32] the antichrist refuses the true by his
[1:47:33] doctrine take his own bride
[1:47:36] and they don't they don't say they
[1:47:37] belong to ch
[1:47:39] and they don't say that they don't
[1:47:40] belong to church you talk to the
[1:47:42] national person
[1:47:42] sure i belong to church are you a
[1:47:44] christian question
[1:47:46] i belong to church that don't have one
[1:47:48] thing to do with it
[1:47:49] we ask people in a message are you a
[1:47:51] christian no i believe this i believe
[1:47:53] i believe the same thing i didn't answer
[1:47:54] if you believe the same thing are you a
[1:47:56] christian
[1:47:56] a christian is to be christ-like and if
[1:47:58] you're not christ like as a christian
[1:48:00] you find yourself hooked up in second
[1:48:01] timothy tree one to eight eddie
[1:48:03] high-minded
[1:48:04] lovers of pleasures bad behavior hateful
[1:48:07] bad attitude and you're in church with
[1:48:09] books and tapes saying you believe
[1:48:10] brother branham
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:17] so watch he said those are lodges you're
[1:48:19] only one church that's the mystical body
[1:48:20] of christ
[1:48:21] you don't join that you're born in it
[1:48:22] i've said i've been with a branham
[1:48:24] family 53 years and never to join it
[1:48:26] i was born into it so every sign
[1:48:29] every wonder anointed man prophecy
[1:48:32] all kind of things going forward all
[1:48:34] kinds of signs all kind of wonders how
[1:48:36] are you going to tell the difference
[1:48:37] watch the word for this hour
[1:48:41] watch moses how we could have told bayla
[1:48:44] what's
[1:48:44] my car how you know he was right the
[1:48:47] word
[1:48:48] before him had prophesied that for her
[1:48:51] and people don't want to go back to
[1:48:53] brother branham's message
[1:48:54] but that is the word the prophet word
[1:48:57] for the hour
[1:48:58] that's the only way we could judge
[1:48:59] things to take it back to the world
[1:49:01] people not supposed to judge me by who i
[1:49:03] associate with they're supposed to judge
[1:49:05] me by how
[1:49:06] i stay with the word hallelujah
[1:49:10] not where i go but how i stay with the
[1:49:13] word
[1:49:14] isn't that right and the word before us
[1:49:16] prophesied
[1:49:17] these organizations for this day and
[1:49:19] this curse upon them
[1:49:20] and the thing that would take place his
[1:49:22] truly anointed church will have the word
[1:49:24] a word bride
[1:49:25] here we have here it is today just the
[1:49:27] way it is
[1:49:28] so watch the antichrist spirit is
[1:49:30] heading up
[1:49:31] to a head the word bride is heading up
[1:49:34] to the person of the word of god
[1:49:36] made manifest it means so much to us
[1:49:40] to see our selves positionally placed
[1:49:44] in christ jesus okay could take a little
[1:49:46] more
[1:49:47] i'm going to wrap up now paul said that
[1:49:49] the word came in power as well as voice
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:53] the word preached actually demonstrated
[1:49:56] itself
[1:49:58] like a flaming cotton sword it went to
[1:50:01] the consciousness of men
[1:50:02] like a sailor's knife it cut out
[1:50:05] diseases
[1:50:06] and set kept us free everywhere those
[1:50:09] early believers went they went preaching
[1:50:11] the gospel word
[1:50:12] and god confirmed that word with signs
[1:50:14] following the sick were healed devil
[1:50:16] were cast out
[1:50:17] they spoke with new tongues that was the
[1:50:18] word in action
[1:50:20] the word never failed in the mouth of
[1:50:22] believing christians and in this last
[1:50:24] age
[1:50:25] it is here stronger and greater than
[1:50:27] ever in the true word bride

[1:51:04] of god in the sun
