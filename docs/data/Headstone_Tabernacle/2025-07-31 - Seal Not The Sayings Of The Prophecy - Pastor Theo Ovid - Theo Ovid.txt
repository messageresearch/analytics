Would you like to turn to Psalms Psalms chapter 126 for a scripture reading as we as we want to read the word of God and pray commit the service into the hands of the Lord. Psalm chapter 126, it says, "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dreamed. Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing. Then said they among the heathen, "The Lord had done great things for them. The Lord had done great things for us, whereof we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams of the south. They that sew in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheav with him. May God add blessing to the reading of his word. Let us pray together. Almighty God, we thank you, Father, to be in your presence tonight, Lord. We thank you for your your word, Lord.

Bless the songs as we would sing and worship and create an atmosphere tonight, Lord. We pray that your word would come to us tonight, Father, and speak to our hearts, Lord, and shake us, Lord, Father, and stir us up, Lord. Inspire us and ignite us, Lord, Father, in a way that, Lord, only the spirit can do tonight. We just yield ourselves to you, Lord, and the work of your mighty hands. We pray that you you'll bless this service tonight to our hearts and bless those that were hooked in tonight, Lord, those that will be listening in even afterwards.

In the Old Test where the Old Testament was dead to go in, now it's dead to be outside of your presence. And we thank you that in your presence of life, in the presence of deliverance, in the presence of breakthrough, I pray you release more of your presence here tonight. Speak to us by your word and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. I ask in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Before you take your seats, I'd like you to go to Bibles to Revelation chapter 10 want to reverse from read from verse 8 to 111. And the voice which I heard from heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel and said unto him, give me the little book. And he said unto me, take it, eat it up. It shall make thy belly bitter. It shall be thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was my mouth sweet as honey. As soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. He said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." May God bless his word. You may be seated. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I have something to share with you tonight. I have a special tape, short tape I like to play with you, play for you tonight that I know that will bless and help. But tonight I want to strike this word, go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel. &gt;&gt; And we know who the angel is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it here. The Holy Spirit today, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel &gt;&gt; trying to get the people back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the Holy Spirit will only vindicate the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now if the mighty angel that came with the book open, the way the angel he saw the angel with the stretch back wings with the seven thunders throwing the voices out. If that book is open and a voice come and said go and take that book &gt;&gt; and eat that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what going to happen afterwards? It going to be sweet in the mouth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it going to be bit in the belly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's when we have to live it. &gt;&gt; That's when we have to die out. that we have to stand and testify that this thing is real and true. &gt;&gt; It have truth. It's nice. It is sweet in the mouth. It is sweet to say it back. It is sweet as revelation. But as life as living something that's something different. &gt;&gt; It's bitter when we begin to digest it and recognize it have a cost that goes with this book. &gt;&gt; There's a price that goes with this book. &gt;&gt; It's an effect of this book. It's not only sweet in the mouth, but it going to be bitter in the belly. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the effect of digesting this book is prophecy coming out. &gt;&gt; And we have the testimony of Jesus by having the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; So tonight we have mechanics and dynamics. And the dynamics is here in the form of the spirit of prophecy because dynamics is always spirit. &gt;&gt; When the time is not yet, the anointing of prophecy has to come. &gt;&gt; Now God in the beginning, he has to speak his own word. Let there be light. Let there be this. Let there be that. It have to come out his mouth. You have to prophesy for it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; And that same God &gt;&gt; who spoke his word in the beginning. &gt;&gt; He put a word here. Go to the angel and don't beg for the book. But take the book and eat the book, digest the book. And any man that take that book could only speak what is in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He can't add to the book. He can't take away from the book. That's why he said the spirit, the prophet, and the bride say the same thing. And what they say will already be said in the word. So a man cannot take this book and come up with his own revelation. He cannot take the book and come with his own inspiration. He have to prophesy the same thing. I am not a prophet but the lion have roar. Who can but fear? The Lord God has spoken. Who can but prophesy? I am not a prophet but the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. And God has called us to prophesy. Prophesy your healing. Prophesy your deliverance. Prophesy your breakthrough. Prophesy your victory. Prophesy your overcoming. Prophesy your adoption. You have to prophesy. You have to speak it. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So shall my word be. It shall not return to be void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish the purpose. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said it for listen now. But God bless you. I want to tell you something. One thing. I know I'm holding long. I just want this one thing. I know. I want you to remember there's something fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember, I told you that &gt;&gt; there is a step up &gt;&gt; coming in the church now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while. &gt;&gt; Something is moving. &gt;&gt; I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ. Everyone in our doctrine and our baptism we have come to a place but there is some key &gt;&gt; that will unlock something here &gt;&gt; now he saw the book seal on seven seals and Daniel saw the same and when the seven thunders uttered the voices he don't write and that was in the scripture but it revealed in the last days &gt;&gt; we are at this time &gt;&gt; we are kinish now here a few nights ago I went to brother Vivitz over in Kentucky crossing to Evansville and brother Boswell was with me and I said that day it kept burdening on my heart. I know that something God has promised on the opening up of the power &gt;&gt; yet I'm waiting now for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he was preaching the thunders he said is this the mystery &gt;&gt; of the thunders that will bring back a power into the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A key to unlock &gt;&gt; the power of God to come among the people. This key had to have a hand behind it &gt;&gt; and the hand have to have faith in it &gt;&gt; to turn that key to unlock the power. But the power has to come into the church &gt;&gt; because national force will put the church in the work of the churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We on the verge of something brother. Somebody come from Canaan. The grapes are good. It's our land. God give it to us. We can take it. God said so. Didn't God said we is ours. We are living in the last days. In the last days, I will send out the rain in abundance like that. Both former and latter rain will fall in this day. &gt;&gt; What they had back there, plus &gt;&gt; what God will give us right now is at hand. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. What they had back there, plus &gt;&gt; we have what they had there back there, plus. &gt;&gt; We cannot get what they have. what we have plus no going back there because it t our lives back to the faith of the fathers to pick up what they had back there. We have to pick up what Peter had, what Paul had, what the disciples had. Nothing short of that. We have to go back and pick that up. Plus, we give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you're talking about the I'm I'm going to wrap up here now. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the the the miniac. the maniac of Gadara, man with a thousand devils and so on. How the devil make him so strong and people can hold back the man. And he was talking about the same. Then he said said this, when a person is crippled, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit gets a hold of them. &gt;&gt; If the devil got that much power &gt;&gt; to make a man three or four times his human strength, &gt;&gt; that's why when you see them under the demon power, you can hold them. So take four or five people to hold on somebody. The demons acting up, right? He said, "If the devil got that much power to make a man three or four times his human strength, how much power &gt;&gt; can God put in a man?" &gt;&gt; And that is what comes upon him to make him walk. &gt;&gt; That's how a man can walk &gt;&gt; because a super strength. &gt;&gt; It's God himself coming down. &gt;&gt; Just as the devil empowers somebody to be four times the strength, God empowers somebody. Two little piece of foot could run &gt;&gt; because of the strength of God. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; That's what come upon him to make him walk in the strength of God. They have been crippled for years. His bones come out straight. His hands go straight. He walks like a young new man because the power of the Holy Spirit is on him. &gt;&gt; Almost done. And these were so evil they wrapped the man in chains and he would break them. &gt;&gt; Then he plucked them aunder. There was nothing could bind him. He was really a bad case because he had a legion of demons in him. &gt;&gt; Jesus crossed over from Gada and he was so evil. Not the man. The man was all right. &gt;&gt; Let's go. It's not the man. When you see a person like that, don't never think that it's the man. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that's in the man. Now in that man was some of these spirits that was cast out of the swine gadara. Some of those poor people are out in the inant institution beating their heads against padded bars. Remember devils never die. Devils always live. There will always be a time when devils will have to die. They will be completely totally anniated. But now they are alive and they work from generation to generation upon human beings. Some of them in the form of cancer. Some of them in the form of epilepsy. Some of them in the form of tuberculosis. They get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they can get into a person. &gt;&gt; They have to operate through a person which brings to another thought that the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; covers the earth and is almost helpless until it gets into you and me. &gt;&gt; God is dependent on you and I. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the earth is full of the spirit of God, but it's poured out. It cannot operate until it comes into us. We human beings to operate. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Final quote. The Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else there is in the world. &gt;&gt; Your prestige, your life, your job, your anything there is. You should not cease until you have it. &gt;&gt; You must receive it. If the most I am afraid, they will of my work. I'm afraid of my husband. Don't be afraid. Let that be first place. Let everything else go. Let that be first. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Well, I expect it one of these days, brother. Not one of these days. This is the time. Let it be first before I go and do anything else. Let me have it now. Desperate. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Could we all stand as we want to go straight into this little tape I want to bless you with tonight. Praise the Lord. The message is um praise God. Seal not the scenes of the prophecy for the shame. Praise the Lord. Give the Lord some praise. Somebody say yes Lord Jesus may. Hallelujah. Oh yes Lord Jesus like me. Go and give a love that is fil with a love. Oh, and make me more like I Oh, with all your heart. Come on, sing, oh Jesus make me more likely. [Music] Jesus be more like.

Anoint your people, Lord. Oh hallelujah. Fill this place with your presence Lord with your power Lord and make me. [Music] Oh Jesus [Music] love me. Give me your heart is filled with your love and to be more like me. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for that desire in our hearts to make us more like you to be formed with that word image, Lord. And I pray come on tonight in this special service, this special communion service and speak to our hearts and change our lives. Father, be more like you. Grant it, Father. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you and welcome. We want to turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 22 and Revelation chapter 19. Two scriptures this evening. Revelation 22 7-12. And we read Revelation 19:9-10. Revelation 22:7. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. And I, John, saw these things, and heard them. When I heard them, and seen, I fell unto worship before the feet of the angel, which showed me these things. And he said unto me, "See thou do it not, for I am a thy solo servant, and of thy brethren, the prophets, and of them which keep the scenes of this book, worship God." And he said unto me, "Seal not the scenes of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still. He which is filthy, let him be filthy still. He that is righteous, let him be righteous still. And he that is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be. Revelation 19:9-10 it said he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saints of God and I fell at his feet to worship him. He said unto me see it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. May God bless his word. You may be seated. Just a little thought this evening. Seal not the sayings of the prophecy. And I have an inspiration. The time is at hand. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. We read a quote this morning. As Daniel heard the seven thunders and was forbidden to write, John heard the voices and his book was sealed. The mystery of God would be finished. In other words, God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person. The mystery of God will be revealed. I hear the part now. And when that was completely revealed, then the seven mysteries would open to the church. He's talking about the seven thunders. Uh because in the church prophecy would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and among us. Living among us, we are then worshiping the living Christ that among us. So friends, your faith itself must be anointed. &gt;&gt; This currency of purchase, which is this faith must be anointed. &gt;&gt; There has to have an applied faith, an attitude of faith. Uh God, brother Brandham uh was told the people uh God told him, if you could get the people to believe that even cancer will stand in your way. So we have something, but I don't think we understand the value of what we have. That faith is a purchasing power. &gt;&gt; Shout out purchasing power. &gt;&gt; Purchasing power. &gt;&gt; It's like you have a currency. It's like you have money. It's like you could you you need the bread. You can't eat the money. You need to get the bread. The money is the purchasing power of the bread. &gt;&gt; If you could get to the bakery, you're going to get the bread. &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, you have the purchasing power. &gt;&gt; You could rejoice. You could praise God. You could worship. You're hungry. Yes. But you could be grateful because you have the purchasing power. You have faith as a believer. You have the purchasing power for your deliverance, for your breakthrough to get out of whatever you're in. You have the purchasing power. All that you are, all that you ever will be be is based upon faith in his word. You have to have faith to believe that God going to break you out. That God going to bust you out of what you're in. You have to have faith to believe that you're going to be healed. You have to have faith to believe that you're going to get a breakthrough that God will lift you off that depression and that frustration. You have to have faith to believe that. &gt;&gt; Not that crying and tears. Faith to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does thou believe? Can thou only believe? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, do you believe that it's promised that he'll be moving in and out among us? &gt;&gt; Can we worshiping the living Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John was worshiping the angel. The angel said, "Don't worship me." &gt;&gt; One of your prophets. Amen. Don't worship me. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hallelujah. They have Christ to worship. &gt;&gt; So, we have no man to worship. &gt;&gt; We come to worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When we begin to see Christ, we come to worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So your faith has to be anointed &gt;&gt; to activate dynamics. Not just a dry faith. It's a resurrection faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Praise God. Amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So God, Praise God. Now listen to this. We read this on Thursday. I'm reading back again. I've tried I've been studying I told before the congregation. I've been studying the early church and I watched the way those anointed men prepare the house of the Lord and the order of the Lord's worship in the house. And it struck me real good and I preached about it sometime ago the subject I will restore. And I begin to study on what these men did and the way they take care of the church that God have left them to overseer. Now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it about 5 minutes to see what they did and then I can show you listen the vision that I have for the future. Now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen 12 and one of them had fallen and they had to choose Matias &gt;&gt; to take his place. Now here's the point. Here's the point now. And the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it come. &gt;&gt; Understand this. Judas was not off. &gt;&gt; He hung himself. &gt;&gt; All right. So it was 11. They had to have 12 for it to happen. &gt;&gt; Now Paul was ready the 12th man &gt;&gt; that God was going to find. &gt;&gt; But for dynamics to strike, they had to have 12. &gt;&gt; So they had to pick somebody. &gt;&gt; It have no book of Matias. It has nothing about Matias. They choose Matias. &gt;&gt; And Matias make up the number 12. And then it was ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was set. &gt;&gt; Fire could fall now because everything is in order. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Give the Lord a shout on that one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now these are not my words. Now this is a prophet's word. God waited &gt;&gt; until they get matas in position &gt;&gt; for the fire to fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now this is border man. Now he said the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it can come. They had to choose the bishop prick of Judas that fell by transgression to fulfill scripture. And I believe here we go that all these things has a time of lingering. &gt;&gt; Amen. waiting but it is waiting for the time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right everything is in order waiting &gt;&gt; many times like a child we get impatient we have great anticipation and jump way ahead and that hinders the work until the work get caught up we must move reverently have a purpose in heart to say if the Lord's will and so forth like that if he desires to use us in such and such a way but wait until he makes an opening David had to hear the rustling of malberry tree. He had to know God is going in front of him. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So the dynamics is here today. &gt;&gt; Dynamics is here already &gt;&gt; in the form of the spirit of prophecy &gt;&gt; which is the testimony of Jesus &gt;&gt; and we have that today. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy that give us the authority to know every devil have to go on the run. to give us the authority to say the sick, you're going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blind going to see, &gt;&gt; the deaf going to heal, your family will be delivered &gt;&gt; by the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; That can't return void. We take authority by the word to prophesy from the book. &gt;&gt; The book is already open. We have the authority to go into the book and prophesy. Devil, time up. &gt;&gt; We serve your notice. &gt;&gt; Get out our property. Get off of my land. Give me my mountain. Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, you have to go forward now to pick up the authority you have in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To claim your mountain &gt;&gt; and to claim your inheritance and stop accepting the estate to where you're at right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. So we can only prophesy according to the vision loosed by the spirit of prophecy. Oh my. So Abraham received the word and anything was contrary to the word he called it. It wasn't. In other words, everything was a lying symptom. &gt;&gt; Sarah age, Sarah state, Sarah body was lying to him. As far as he concerned, he not even counting. The Bible said he's staggering at the promise of God through unbelief. &gt;&gt; Listen, he had frustrations. He had upsets ups and down like everybody else, like what you would have, but not at the promise. because he was convinced. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was fully persuaded, &gt;&gt; fully persuaded that God was able to perform &gt;&gt; what he promised. &gt;&gt; Tonight, you got to be fully persuaded. &gt;&gt; Got to be convinced. &gt;&gt; If your body don't feel it, that's not having to do with it. &gt;&gt; I give your foot not feeling it, your eye not feeling it, your heart not you're not feeling it, it's not feelless down this, it's believe this. My God. And believing is a substance that create the faith. &gt;&gt; I want to say that believing is a substance that create the faith. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. So Jesus. So brother s back the faith. He introduced the Messiah and revealed all the mysteries of God. And I want to bring back this one. The appearing and coming is another quote different from the one I say this morning. It's two different things. The appearing of the Lord is now the appeal appearing among his people. We see him in his same works, the appearing his holy spirit. But his coming, here we go, will be his physical being &gt;&gt; to catch the church up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the trump of God. His coming, his actual coming. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Won't be long with you. So there are five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order. &gt;&gt; Apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors, those are called offices by God. Then in the local congregation there are nine spiritual gifts that work among the people &gt;&gt; which include prophecy, tongues, interpretations, wisdom, knowledge, gifts of faith, gifts of healing, all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in these offices and places in the offices you hear from the apostle his ministry. You hear from the prophet his ministry, from the evangelist, from the teacher, from the pastor. Each has a separate ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So no man packing all five. either here claim a man claim to have all five liars &gt;&gt; because that's not the scripture it's a separate ministry and that is why God divide the land everybody can have all the land God here Judah here Ephraim here the land is divided &gt;&gt; the land got to be divided &gt;&gt; pastor here prophet here teacher here evangelist here apostle here land divided &gt;&gt; to do what set the church in order from the pastor you hear from the apostle you hear from the prophet you hear from each ministry Because he's ministry of a work to bring you to that perfection. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It's not a ministry for ministry. It's a ministry for work. &gt;&gt; What work? For the perfecting of the saints. For the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body till we all come into unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So then in these offices and places, you hear from the apostle and so forth. Each has a separate ministry and their ministries of God. God had set them in a church for this purpose. Then God comes down in the form of the Holy Spirit among his congregation to speak with tongues. Another one interpret tells a certain thing to do and so forth. Then there are gifts of wisdom, knowledge, interpretations. All kind of gifts go in the church. But the first way it has got to come first by the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you see the message, nothing has mattered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need a next interpretation, a next idea. You see the core thing &gt;&gt; that you have to be formed into the word image. You have to get the word inside of you. You're not a lesser son and somebody's a higher son. It's sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Placed in different positions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You getting God in you is the same God in this one and that one. The same God. But say you have enough God in you, you can speak the next world into existence. &gt;&gt; God who have little parts and strong parts and weak parts. God is God. &gt;&gt; You have a small light, big light, is the same light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you get a content of the ocean in a little bottle is just as much material as what in the entire ocean. &gt;&gt; If you go and get a little bottle of ocean water, everything in that little bottle is what the ocean have in it. &gt;&gt; What you have there is a measure. And you have to come into the measure of the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; But everything is inside of here. All the power is inside of there. All the glory is inside of there. Hallelujah. All the power is inside of there in your measure. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Do you see you have everything that the ocean has? &gt;&gt; Do you see you getting your measure? [Applause] That's why Elisha had the faith to ask Elijah, "Give me a double portion." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't I better what I ask him for. I better ask small. &gt;&gt; He said double. &gt;&gt; And then you ask a hard thing. &gt;&gt; It's not an easy thing. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, this young man call about double. &gt;&gt; See a big man crossing over. He want to leave. He said I want a double what you have. &gt;&gt; It's double trouble I have to deal with. So let me take the double one time. It's double trials. It's double testing. I must get some double for my trouble. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Say amen somebody. Don't ask for nothing less than your double. That's why I say your cup must run over. &gt;&gt; You're not asking enough. &gt;&gt; You must trouble God. &gt;&gt; Say it's me again. &gt;&gt; Okay. The Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Don't get tired. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he's not weary. He can't get tired. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may be see sometime people call the pastor didn't mean to disturb you. But that's what he's there for to be disturbed. &gt;&gt; And sometime you think that thing to God. You don't want to disturb God. So you got some time. Time for what? He not in time. &gt;&gt; You giving God time. What you want time for? &gt;&gt; Jacob wrestled with the angel. He said he said I leave now. You getting breaking deck. He said what you talking about? &gt;&gt; You can't leave yet. I ain't changed yet. I I ain't get the breakthrough yet. Where you going? You ain't going nowhere. It's lock neck, lock hand, lock foot.

No he playing limping &gt;&gt; that time that man chain &gt;&gt; new walk &gt;&gt; new talk &gt;&gt; for you going Jacob I'm fine I go and meet my brother &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; hallelujah got be frighten you know but now he's a man &gt;&gt; that wrestling with God &gt;&gt; have a name change that nobody know but he himself &gt;&gt; his name change from Jacob &gt;&gt; to Israel he could beat anybody he could be the challenge anywhere Anytime, any place, under any condition, he can face the challenge now because he met the angel. And when you meet the angel, blow away to man. Praise God. Give the Lord a shout. Man can stop you when you meet the angel. Oh, hallelujah. Seal not the scenes of the book because the time is at hand. What time? Time for victory. Time for dynamics. Time for deliverance. Time for revival. Time for your home to be delivered. Time for the supernatural to break in the church. The time is at hand. Oh, glory to God. Glory. Glory to God. You ain't see power yet, but you're about to see power. Power like you have never seen before. Oh, we're going to write another book of Acts. I am Alpha and Omega. If that branch, if that branch put back another original branch, they will get original fruit. It had grapefruit, it had lemon grafted them, it had Portugal grafted him, all kind of spirits grafted him. But we pushing out another original branch, another book of Acts, Acts 16. Hallelujah. Praise God. Mark 16 in action rather. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You may be seated. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to wrap up. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; At least I want to think so. &gt;&gt; But the fire is here. Now those seeds watch. My God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. The Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ. This big bump. You are a predestinated seed just like Christ was. Amen. &gt;&gt; That amen is not good. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said you are &gt;&gt; a predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; You have to believe that &gt;&gt; just like &gt;&gt; Christ. I say it again. You are &gt;&gt; you. I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; You this morning. You &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; don't look around. You You are predestinated. The devil is a liar. You are. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel. I'm not talking to your feeling. I'm not preaching to your feeling. I'm preaching to you. &gt;&gt; The seed in you because you are not the believer. The word in you, that's the believer. The seed in you, that's the believer. Come on you believers, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Okay, now watch. Get this. May be seated. &gt;&gt; So you are predestined just like Christ was. And when the rain falls &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; on the seed. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The life produces itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit falls. &gt;&gt; So you're trying to do your best. And you try &gt;&gt; you succeed sometime you flop sometimes then know what we talking about you trying something you try a little thing &gt;&gt; Peter try a little thing too after you he draw a sword and cut off mans &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; because he find people come to take Jesus but later on when he really see in trouble to Christ &gt;&gt; but in the garden of Gethsemane Peter draw sword &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and Jesus will pick up the man ears and put it on &gt;&gt; amen and I tell him Thursday when the man went home and tell you Pet is and and Jesus come to put it back on and wife said I do believe it it have no blood it have no signs of cut but Jesus you see that's all that's that's the that's the omnipotence we talking about &gt;&gt; a brother cut off a man ear &gt;&gt; a Christian brother &gt;&gt; a follower of Jesus &gt;&gt; cut off a man ear with a sword and Jesus had to stick back that man ear and say brethren don't move like If you live by the sword, &gt;&gt; you will die by the sword. &gt;&gt; That is not the sword to use. The sword to use is the word. &gt;&gt; Don't bring I am business and so on. That man was healed &gt;&gt; instantly. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He wasn't a Christian. &gt;&gt; And God sticky ears out. &gt;&gt; Stick his head back. Okay. Now, watch here. The part I want to get to. &gt;&gt; When it fell on those seeds, he chose them, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were predestined seed. They hold themselves up in the upper room. All right. &gt;&gt; These seeds, are you ready? &gt;&gt; The word was laying on deer without life in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the secret? &gt;&gt; The word in a bride. &gt;&gt; So listen to this, Gideon. They went up in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without life in the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed is there. &gt;&gt; Word is there. &gt;&gt; They're dry. &gt;&gt; Dry seeds. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Waiting for water. Yeah, &gt;&gt; water is spirit. &gt;&gt; Try seas waiting for water. &gt;&gt; If the devil could disconnect the sea from the water, nothing happen. &gt;&gt; But once water hit that sea, there's trouble &gt;&gt; because it mean life have to manifest itself. Life can't help it. It's an automatic law. &gt;&gt; It's the law of God. Once this water hit the seed, it has to it must it is necessary. It is compulsory for that seed to produce itself because the law in Genesis say every seed must bring forth after its kind. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you you are different kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're different kind of species. &gt;&gt; They have serpent seed on the earth. &gt;&gt; They're looking like humans, &gt;&gt; but there's not. &gt;&gt; They are vipers. The family of snake and serpent and evil and whatnot. They can't help it. They automatic with it. And if God put the law in the fish and the fish don't run down and say, you know what, I feeling let to fly this evening. The the fish will die &gt;&gt; because God put no law in fish to fly and the birds are going straight down and diving and taking a a deep dive, the bird will die. The law in the bird is to fly. The law in the fish is to swim. The law is a law in a Christian. What you think that law is there for? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. There's a law inside of you. The the law in the fish, it's not outside. The fish don't take out a fish mantle and say he put on fins. &gt;&gt; He go and put on fins to go and take a swim. The fish doesn't wear spins. He have that built in. The birds go say and buy some wings. You're going to check out BWIA to find how the planers fly. The bird not in that. The bird have the winds built in. And the Christian, you the believer have said Mark 16 that built in these signs shall follow them that believe. This is built in. When you leave here and you go back to your home, you're going to speak them demons completely out of your home. This is built in. This is warfare. This is taking back what the devil took from you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is taking back. This is taking the authority in my name. They shall cast out devils in my name. They're going to speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; I say that time is at hand for Mark 16 to be in action. &gt;&gt; Time for miracles, time for signs, &gt;&gt; time for wonders. Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they were there. My God, just have about a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; They were there dry seats &gt;&gt; in the upper room and all of a sudden, he said, "Watch." All of a sudden, as the waters begin to begin to gush down, it actually filled the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow. &gt;&gt; It begin to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; So, friends, you have not seen me manifested yet. All you've seen is prophecy. All hearing is prophecy. What we have had all these years has been the testimony of Jesus. What we had all these years because we went and take the book from the angel's hand. He said thou must prophesy again. And we are prophesying again of a revival of a breakthrough of the appointment of the Holy Ghost of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire. We are prophesying again. In this time of lingering, we are being tested. But we're not waiting for this clouds to prophesy rain. When there is no clouds, we say it's going to rain anyhow. The problem is not the rain. The problem is the seed. Because rain coming anyhow. Nobody going to stop this rain. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Remember &gt;&gt; Genesis said, "Every seed will have to bring after it kind." &gt;&gt; Remember the earth is full of seeds and the rain makes it bring forth after its kind. &gt;&gt; So God throw out the seeds. You don't know who is who but the rain coming &gt;&gt; to prove no matter &gt;&gt; and when the rain come is no longer to prophesy. There's no need to prophesy. &gt;&gt; All the time they prophesy Messiah coming, Messiah coming, Messiah coming. But when John said, "Behold the lamb of God." Prophecy finished. &gt;&gt; It finished. Now it went from John the prophet prophet to the prophecy the fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So Christ was the fulfillment of the Old Testament. He cap off the Old Testament. Become the cornerstone of the New Testament where he built his church that was going to add seven ages. And during them ages, we fell down into the ground. Up come Luther, he's bringing up something. Up come Wesley, he's bringing up something. Up come the Pentecost. They're bringing up something. Here come. Hallelujah. With the entire mystery of God, the full word, the open book to bring back sons back upon the face of the earth. The devil in a ride. &gt;&gt; Not this time. Not this time. This bride is not like evil. She going to be the word. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. I feel the anointing of God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. My God. &gt;&gt; Brother, leave all the chemicals in different books and tapes. &gt;&gt; Men just playing. This is oxygen. &gt;&gt; This is nitrogen. They playing a tape with nitrogen. They bring a tape with oxygen in it, sulfur in it, sodium in it. But God will have some spiritual scientists that they're going to take from here, add here, take from here, add here, shake it here, pour it here. My God, God, spiritual scientist. And you will hear an explosion. You're going to create a revival. He said, "What we see should make a church." Praise God. Should make a what we see. We're supposed to do something. Make a church where a revival break out. And we're going to say the seven thunders that's not being written is being made manifested because God has spiritual scientists in this last day of the mind of God to know how to put the word together for the fire to fall. Your faith this evening is being anointed. You're going to pull on the fire. You're going to pull on the Holy Ghost. You're going to pull on the power of God. We're going to have a revival. Listen to this. The seed must have seed water &gt;&gt; before it could grow. &gt;&gt; It must have water to fall before the seed has planted to grow. Now remember the word mor u r e h morin's teaching for marine morin's teaching and it have l rain &gt;&gt; have teaching rain &gt;&gt; and l rain is to s the seed is reveal all the mysteries when that is over &gt;&gt; when that seed get dead ripe &gt;&gt; seed down dead ripe &gt;&gt; ripen seed &gt;&gt; ripe and grain &gt;&gt; there's only one thing left &gt;&gt; where is the Lord God of Elijah with one thing left rain. &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy. We unsealing it this evening. Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book. &gt;&gt; My God, I got over no other church, but fire going to fall in this place. Rain going to fall in this place. My God has already started. We are anointed. You are anointed. The anointing is upon you. When you go home, open your mouth. When you open a door, speak it. Say, "The anointing is upon me." Walk in with the anointing. Believe the anointing is upon you. Whatever you touch going to be anointed. Oh, glory to God. It was in their hands. It was in their feet. It was in their tongue. It was all over them. Oh, it going to be all over you. Fire was upon them. Fire of the Holy Ghost. Oh, give the Lord some praise this people. How many of you inspired this evening? How many feel anointed this evening? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will be seated. &gt;&gt; Almost true. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Prophecy. &gt;&gt; The latter rain &gt;&gt; is fixing to fall. &gt;&gt; He was talking about God telling Abraham, Sarah, I'm going to visit you &gt;&gt; according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; You're going to have that baby you waited on. &gt;&gt; The latter rain is fixing to fall. You held that seed in there &gt;&gt; long enough. &gt;&gt; Believe him. &gt;&gt; You're looking for a coming son and he is coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You're pregnant with God. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you didn't hear me this evening. You didn't hear me this evening. You are pregnant with God. You have the seed of God inside of you. You're going to produce Messiah. Messiah going to live. Messiah going to walk in Trinidad. You know what the Messiah is? Anointed word. When the word is anointed, it produces Messiah. The word is a seed. You are that seed. The anointing will come upon you. Sit down a minute. Sit down a minute. What did Jesus say when he went to the temple? He found Isaiah 61. What was Jesus words? The spirit is upon me. Oh, hallelujah. Did you get that? He was the full seed and he had to come and say, "The spirit is upon me for he had &gt;&gt; anointed me." That's what we talking about. You have to be anointed. You will say what Jesus said. The spirit is upon me for he hath the Lord himself. He hath anointed me. Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. You are coming into your anointing. You are coming into your inheritance. You are coming into your authority. You're coming into the witness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "You see why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed that he planted for the body. &gt;&gt; The rain is going to fall pretty soon. &gt;&gt; The real rain. &gt;&gt; But it has to have seed to fall on. If the rain fall and there's no seed, you got landside, &gt;&gt; you get floods, &gt;&gt; but God have to put in a seed. &gt;&gt; Is the seed inside of you this evening? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, what is that gospel light? What does it do? The Holy Spirit, what does it do? It ripens the crop. And in the last days, the Holy Spirit will pour out in time in the last days to bring in the latter rain, &gt;&gt; the real rain. &gt;&gt; My God. First you have to have the rain where we still planting the knowledge seed and bring forth unbelief and so on. But then why every seed but after his kind. God made man in his image and of his kind and his to be his word on the earth. He expressed it in Jesus Christ. What was it? God was in Christ. That's a man after his kind. God made man in his own image after his kind. His kind is what the word. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then watch. What are we to be sons of God with the express word in the church carrying on? That's the mystical body of Christ carrying on the same works. God is longing when we could carry on the same works. Sitting in a pew is not carrying our works. Thousands of church people sit and go in churches and so on. That's that his works is his life flowing through us. &gt;&gt; When we become a pipe, dead, emptied out, turned upside down and there's no hindrance to the flow of the spirit. And God must say, "There is my spirit flowing freely." Friends, I'm closing. Musician, come on, please. I believe in my heart that we have turned a corner. I believe that something is about to break forth. &gt;&gt; I believe the time is at hand. &gt;&gt; Now, I can't only believe that. You have got to believe it also. &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, then you must act on it. You must act upon what you believe. If you believe the anointing upon you, don't be afraid to pray. If you're throwing the word prayer with the eye open, pray for them when the eye closed. &gt;&gt; But pray. Pray over them. Pray around them. Pray in the home. Pray in the kitchen. Pray in the drawing room. Pray on the street. Praying when you're traveling. Do like you're talking on your phone and and you're talking like you're talking to nobody. But praise God. But you're praying. You're talking to God. What you doing? You're keeping the atmosphere. The devil want to break the atmosphere. That's why you want to have confusion between husband and wife, mother and daughter, father and son. You want to create disturbances to get you out of the atmosphere because once you're out in the atmosphere, the channel is cut, the pipe is cut. It's broken. But we just ste the atmosphere. They want to carry on to throw you off and you're holding your peace. Better keep a tongue. Keep your tongue still. Don't say nothing. Hold your peace. Keep the atmosphere and watch that snake. Once you keep quiet enough, you're going to see the snake moving. And once you could see when he moving, don't don't wh him. Just time him &gt;&gt; and then cut the head off. &gt;&gt; Take that head off. Don't wh that snake now. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you wh him, he might run and hide somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let him walk. Let him walk like in the ceiling. You're watching him. You're watching him. &gt;&gt; Just have the cut lash ready. &gt;&gt; And when you when you see him in a good spot, take his head off. &gt;&gt; Cash that serpent. Stamp on his head. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God bless you. Seal up the sins of the prophecy of this book. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise. Hallelujah. Give him praise this evening. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh, give him a shout. Give him a worship. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a message tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Anointing will fall on me. Oh, anointing. Oh, let it fall on me. Oh, let the power of the Holy Ghost fall on me. Oh, anointing fall on me. Oh, let's lift our hand and sing. Oh anoint. Glory. Hallelujah. Oh let it fall on me. Oh anointing. Let it fall on me. Ooh let the power of the Holy Ghost fall on me. Anointing fall on me. Oh, one more time. Hallelujah. Anointing.
