[7:53] next few minutes Lord may you speak lifp
[7:56] to air to your people in the precious
[7:58] name of Jesus Christ Christ and the
[8:00] church says and the church says am amen
[8:04] well this evening we have our communion
[8:08] service and uh before we do that how
[8:11] many appreciate the service this morning
[8:13] appreciate our pastor Restoration in the
[8:16] time of
[8:17] judgment amen what a message what a
[8:20] masterpiece what an inspiration to us
[8:23] this evening and um God's Prophet
[8:26] brother bam believe that it's it's
[8:28] really critical it's important to start
[8:30] the new year with the Lord's Supper in
[8:32] fact uh brother Bram sometimes would
[8:35] have communion service for his old years
[8:37] night on New Year's Eve service and it's
[8:39] very striking to me as I've been
[8:42] meditating on the word that the very
[8:44] last message that brother brandham
[8:46] preached before he went on to be with
[8:48] the Lord was communion you know and I
[8:51] said God doesn't make mistakes but God
[8:53] could have had brother brandham to speak
[8:54] on anything but he led him to speak on
[8:58] communion
[8:59] um as his parting words to us so today
[9:02] we want to just speak a bit about
[9:04] communion before we
[9:06] approach this sacred ordinance this
[9:09] evening so if you have your Bibles would
[9:12] you turn with me to 1 Corinthians 11
[9:16] verse
[9:18] 23 certainly want to greet everyone this
[9:21] evening happy New Year and greet all on
[9:23] the
[9:28] internet
[9:43] so 1 Corinthians 11 verse
[9:47] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[9:50] which also I delivered unto
[9:54] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[9:58] in which he was betrayed took
[10:00] bread and when he had given thanks he
[10:02] Breo it and said take eat this is my
[10:05] body which is broken for you this do in
[10:09] remembrance of me after the same manner
[10:12] also he took the cup which he had SED
[10:15] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[10:16] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[10:20] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[10:22] of me for as often as he eat this bread
[10:25] and drink this cup he do show the Lord's
[10:27] death till he come
[10:30] wherefore whoever shall eat this bread
[10:31] and drink this cup of the Lord
[10:33] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[10:35] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[10:37] examine himself and so let him eat of
[10:40] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[10:43] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[10:45] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[10:48] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[10:51] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[10:53] and many sleep for if we would judge
[10:56] ourselves we should not be judged
[10:59] but when we are judged we are chastened
[11:01] of the Lord that we should not be
[11:04] condemned with the world wherefore my
[11:06] brethren when you come together to eat t
[11:08] one for another and if any man hunger
[11:11] let him eat at home that he come not
[11:13] together unto condemnation and the rest
[11:15] will I set in order when I come shall we
[11:17] pray once more heavenly father as we
[11:20] prepare to approach this sacred service
[11:23] Lord and father may you bless the
[11:25] reading of the word and bless the
[11:27] hearing of the word father for the next
[11:29] few minutes to set the tone for Lord
[11:31] this first communion service of this
[11:33] year Lord may you speak to every heart
[11:35] and may such a sincerity and honesty
[11:39] father sacredness dropped down here
[11:40] tonight to realize that what we're about
[11:43] to do is a very serious undertaking
[11:45] father may you bless your people may you
[11:47] bless those that would participate may
[11:49] you bless the Lord God the ministry and
[11:51] the Believers Lord in the precious name
[11:53] of Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[11:56] and amen you may be seated so just for a
[11:59] few minutes before brother Steven comes
[12:01] back to lead us in communion I have a
[12:04] thought this evening do this in
[12:08] remembrance of me you know Memories We
[12:12] we all have memories good memories bad
[12:15] memories short memories long memories
[12:18] happy memories sad memories one thing we
[12:21] all have in common our memories but this
[12:24] scripture raises some spiritual alarms
[12:27] because it suggests that somehow we can
[12:30] live our lives and forget about Christ
[12:33] we can come to church and forget about
[12:36] Christ we could sit in the message and
[12:39] forget about Christ but here it is in
[12:42] this passage of texts Jesus is saying do
[12:45] this in
[12:48] remembrance of me having a bad memory
[12:52] may have its advantages because some of
[12:55] us or all of us we may have things that
[12:58] we would rather forget but there are
[13:00] times when having a bad memory can have
[13:03] serious
[13:04] consequences one of the great fears in
[13:07] scripture for a Christian is
[13:09] forgetfulness not the Casual type of
[13:12] forgetting your keys or forgetting
[13:14] something but the kind of forgetfulness
[13:16] that can get you killed the kind of
[13:18] forgetfulness that creates problems with
[13:20] God it's a
[13:22] forgetfulness of the Lord where we
[13:25] forget the purpose forget why we are
[13:28] here
[13:29] sometimes we forget out of panic things
[13:32] in our lives may be going in so many
[13:34] different directions that it seems all
[13:37] that we could do to survive is focus on
[13:39] the present situation and how we going
[13:41] to get out of the problem and in doing
[13:43] so we forget about Christ on the other
[13:46] hand things might be so good so blessed
[13:49] so powerful you so get caught up in what
[13:52] we eat and drink and work and succeed at
[13:55] the end result of it is we end up
[13:58] forgetting Christ one time Paul says to
[14:01] Timothy remember Christ Jesus or
[14:04] remember Jesus Christ this message would
[14:07] not be necessary or this encouragement
[14:09] or this word would not be necessary if
[14:11] we
[14:12] always remembered Christ and the real
[14:16] deeper question this evening is how can
[14:18] we forget the one who called us how
[14:21] could we forget the one who took us out
[14:23] of the Miry clay how could we forget the
[14:25] one who saved us how could we really
[14:28] forget the one who called us and loved
[14:31] us when we were lost and in the
[14:32] condition that were we in but yet it is
[14:35] Jesus is saying to his disciples do this
[14:39] in remembrance of me it is amazing how
[14:43] easy it is to forget the most important
[14:46] things in life sometimes you spend so
[14:49] much time focused on the insignificant
[14:51] things until there is no strength to
[14:54] deal with the significant things and if
[14:57] we would all admit it to tonight the
[15:00] truth is all of us are guilty in some
[15:02] way of forgetting Christ the mornings
[15:06] you woke up and forgot to pray the
[15:09] mornings you got up and forgot the
[15:11] scriptures the days you got up and
[15:13] forgot to pick up a spoken word book the
[15:15] days you forgot to acknowledge that you
[15:18] are
[15:19] alive because of
[15:24] him the truth is we forget about Christ
[15:27] sometimes and to think in scripture when
[15:29] Jesus was here Mary and Joseph one time
[15:32] the Bible said they went to a feast and
[15:34] they got so caught up in the feast
[15:36] brother Powell that they forgot
[15:39] Jesus they were so caught up in the
[15:41] feast that it took three days before
[15:44] they realized that Jesus was not with
[15:47] them they got so caught up in the
[15:49] tradition of doing what they did that
[15:52] they assumed that Jesus was with
[15:54] somebody else in the crow and they had
[15:55] to retrace themselves and it was only
[15:57] then they found Jesus was in the temple
[16:01] expounding on the scriptures they had
[16:03] forgotten
[16:04] Jesus the truth is if we are really
[16:07] completely sold out to God we would
[16:09] spend all day all night talking about
[16:13] him thinking about him am looking for
[16:17] him amen but I thank God for this Most
[16:20] Holy reminder today do this in
[16:24] remembrance of me we remember songs we
[16:28] remember remember scriptures we remember
[16:30] words but do we really remember Jesus
[16:34] but for the next few minutes I want to
[16:35] present something here it is Paul in the
[16:38] book of Corinthians he is writing to the
[16:40] Corinthians and he's saying Jesus asked
[16:43] all of his followers to participate in
[16:45] this Holy Communion this special meal in
[16:48] remembrance of him and I'm sure those
[16:50] words would have sounded foreign to the
[16:52] Corinthians as they might to some of us
[16:54] today because how could you remember
[16:56] somebody you never saw
[16:59] how could you remember somebody you
[17:01] never talked to how could you remember
[17:03] somebody you never listen to because
[17:05] Jesus never went to
[17:07] Corinth the Christians they had only
[17:09] heard of him how could Jesus say do this
[17:13] in remembrance of
[17:15] me like today just as it was in Corinth
[17:19] the Christians had a lot of issues in
[17:21] that day the Christians in that
[17:23] Corinthian Church had many issues some
[17:25] like Apollo some like Paul some feel
[17:27] Peter should come and preach
[17:29] and Paul in the midst of that in that 1
[17:32] Corinthians chapter 11 Begins by talking
[17:35] about follow me as I follow Christ amen
[17:38] and as he begin to address certain
[17:40] issues of what was taking place in the
[17:42] church he brings them to a spot where he
[17:44] says I am giving you something the same
[17:46] way God give it to me and he begins to
[17:49] tell of what Jesus did and he presents a
[17:53] context because for you to understand
[17:56] the context of what Jesus was saying of
[17:58] of of do this in remembrance of me you
[18:01] have to understand the scenario at the
[18:03] time Jesus was at the end of his
[18:06] ministry he had finished all of his
[18:08] altercation and clashes with the
[18:10] Pharisees and the Sadducees and they
[18:12] were out to just get him and here it was
[18:15] he was about to participate in the Feast
[18:18] of the Passover Hallelujah with his
[18:20] disciples this was no strange Feast this
[18:23] was a feast that every single Jew was
[18:27] used to particip ipating in because this
[18:29] was the one time of the year they would
[18:31] remember what happened when they came
[18:33] out of Egypt Hallelujah GL Moses had
[18:36] commanded them always remember this day
[18:39] how God took you out of Egypt and how
[18:41] the death angel passed over you and they
[18:44] would celebrate with a feast that's
[18:48] right some of you may know that during
[18:51] the Feast of the Passover it's a
[18:52] tradition so there are certain things
[18:54] that must take place and and among the
[18:56] things that take place brother the
[18:57] popular is the youngest child would ask
[18:59] the oldest person in the room in every
[19:02] house under Feast of Passover they would
[19:03] ask the question what makes tonight
[19:06] different from every other
[19:09] night what makes this meal different
[19:13] from every other meal I'm not going to
[19:16] meet too long with you we're about to
[19:17] prepare for communion what makes tonight
[19:20] so special and what is amazing is the
[19:23] oldest person in the room has to say it
[19:26] a certain way and if there's only one
[19:29] way to say it you cannot say I want to
[19:32] tell you what happened to them when they
[19:34] came out of
[19:36] Egypt according to the Jewish law it has
[19:40] to be a firsters recollection so you
[19:44] must say this is what the Lord did for
[19:46] me when he took me out of Egypt that's
[19:49] why this night is special and that is
[19:53] the situation the backdrop of what was
[19:55] taking place that night now understand
[19:58] understand this the disciples did not
[19:59] know what to expect that night they were
[20:01] just expecting a usual Passover feast
[20:06] but here it is something different is
[20:09] taking place it was their custom to have
[20:13] unleavened bread it was their custom to
[20:15] have lamb and to have wine and bitter
[20:17] herbs because that's what Moses
[20:18] instructed them to do years ago but this
[20:20] time was different because here it is
[20:23] Jesus Takes the bread and breaks it and
[20:25] said this is my body
[20:29] Lord do this in remembrance of me and
[20:35] the same wine that they would have as
[20:36] their custom he said this represents my
[20:40] blood and I wonder what was happening
[20:43] that night that was so different from
[20:45] every other night it was supposed to be
[20:47] different but this night was another
[20:50] kind of
[20:51] difference Jesus before their very eyes
[20:54] was
[20:54] redefining the Passover he was red
[20:58] refining their understanding of what
[21:00] that night meant because whereas many
[21:03] many years before they had slain a lamb
[21:05] and the blood was put in the door poost
[21:07] here it was the lamb was in the room
[21:09] with
[21:10] them and as he spoke of his body being
[21:13] broken they didn't even realize that
[21:15] just a couple days later his body was
[21:17] going to be broken for
[21:20] them it was a
[21:23] different kind of night prise God he
[21:26] said this cup that is poured out for you
[21:28] is the New Covenant in my blood he was
[21:31] bringing something serious to them
[21:33] something
[21:35] different communion feet washing and
[21:39] water baptism are three ordinances given
[21:43] to us in
[21:45] scripture water baptism only needs to
[21:47] happen once when you are baptized in
[21:50] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:51] Christ that just needs to happen once
[21:54] but God instituted a way to always
[21:58] remember him by saying do this in
[22:02] remembrance of
[22:04] me tonight we stand here or today we
[22:07] stand here just like the Corinthians who
[22:10] did not know Jesus after the flesh we
[22:13] never saw his feet when he walked on
[22:16] this Earth we never saw the hands that
[22:18] comforted the weary we or the eyes that
[22:21] could see through your life and see
[22:22] what's going on in the depths of your
[22:24] soul amen but we must remember him
[22:27] Hallelujah we never heard when he said
[22:29] the words peace be still or when he
[22:31] cried Lazarus come forth but yet we are
[22:33] required to remember him Hallelujah we
[22:37] cannot speak of how he smiled or how he
[22:40] dressed or when he rebuked the Pharisees
[22:42] for we do not know him after the flesh
[22:44] but we know him as the word and we know
[22:46] him after the spirit tonight and in the
[22:49] same way we can know him as much as
[22:51] Peter Paul or John knew him because when
[22:53] you have an experience with the Holy
[22:55] Ghost you have an experience with Jesus
[22:59] amen hallelujah do this in remembrance
[23:03] of me brother brandom in the message
[23:05] communion as he ended his ministry he
[23:07] spoke of
[23:08] how people brought the ordinances of God
[23:12] as
[23:13] tradition where it just became something
[23:16] to do and that's why I really want to
[23:18] caution the church tonight to really
[23:21] take this and bring it to life in your
[23:23] heart in your mind in your very being
[23:25] that as you do this it's really an
[23:27] opportunity for us to really remember
[23:30] Jesus to remember the pain the Suffering
[23:33] The Agony the tears the cries remember
[23:39] Gethsemane remember the battle of wills
[23:41] as he had to yield his will to say Lord
[23:44] father not my will but ding be done
[23:48] hallelujah if you could picture for a
[23:50] minute the drops of blood that were at
[23:53] Jesus's feet because the Bible says his
[23:56] sweat turned to blood
[23:58] this was not the blood of a wounded man
[24:00] this was the blood of a man who was yet
[24:01] to be
[24:05] wounded but what manner of love it was
[24:07] that he would stand there for us and yet
[24:10] he requires us this evening to do this
[24:12] in
[24:13] remembrance of
[24:16] him with the random in the message
[24:18] communion I'm almost getting ready to
[24:19] close out he says what are you you are a
[24:22] Christian you live before everybody as a
[24:24] Christian and if you take this talking
[24:26] about communion and don't live as a
[24:27] Christian you're not Discerning the
[24:29] Lord's body you're putting a stumbling
[24:32] block in somebody else's
[24:36] way now in other words don't just come
[24:38] and take it as I said a while ago but
[24:40] what the Jews had sacrificed it was
[24:42] wonderful but it got to a place where
[24:44] they didn't do it in sincerity in
[24:47] reverence and in
[24:49] order it became a Sten in Gods
[24:53] knows now the same thing is by our
[24:56] coming to take the Lord's Supper that we
[24:58] must come knowing what we are
[25:00] doing just like when you go into the
[25:03] water to be baptized in the name of
[25:05] Jesus Christ this is the prophet you
[25:06] know what you're doing you putting on to
[25:08] the church what God has put in you
[25:10] Christ and when we take this it shows to
[25:13] the church that I believe every word of
[25:15] God I believe that he is the bread of
[25:18] life that come from God out of Heaven I
[25:21] believe every word that he says is truth
[25:23] and I live by it to the best of my
[25:25] knowledge God being my therefore before
[25:29] my brothers before my sisters I do not
[25:32] swear I do not curse I do not do these
[25:34] things because I love the Lord and the
[25:37] Lord knows it and bears me record
[25:39] therefore before you I take the pel of
[25:42] his body to know that I am not condemned
[25:44] with the world see there you are then
[25:47] it's a blessing the musicians going to
[25:50] come up I'm about to close as but deing
[25:52] is ready to come but I challenge you
[25:54] this evening before we even switch over
[25:57] over to begin to pray in your heart the
[26:00] scripture said t one for
[26:03] another
[26:05] meditate on Jesus when you do this
[26:11] remember he died for you amen remember
[26:15] he called you remember he elected you
[26:18] remember he sent a prophet for you
[26:21] remember he revealed every mystery
[26:24] that's why he says do this in
[26:26] remembrance of me do this in remembrance
[26:30] of me because I am Alpha and Omega I am
[26:34] the beginning and the end do this in
[26:36] remembrance of me because even though
[26:38] you see me and you know I'm going to die
[26:40] I'm not going to stay dead I'm going to
[26:41] be raised from the dead I'm not going to
[26:44] leave you comfortless but do this in
[26:46] remembrance of me because the same works
[26:48] that I do you are going to do also
[26:50] Hallelujah do this in remembrance of me
[26:53] to jolt you back into the reality that
[26:55] this is a serious undertaking
[26:58] amen you do show the Lord's death until
[27:01] he comes we have come to the spot where
[27:03] we don't even acknowledge that he died
[27:05] for us and church has become such a
[27:08] tradition if we just come and shout and
[27:10] put our hands up put our hands down and
[27:11] go back home and there's no change in
[27:13] our Behavior that's all right
[27:15] but tonight I see as a night of
[27:17] refreshing Amen to really remember where
[27:20] he is supposed to be in your life in
[27:22] your heart in your mind in your being
[27:25] and to forget everything else
[27:28] if the choice is to remember your school
[27:30] or remember Jesus we have to remember
[27:32] Jesus remember where you live or
[27:34] remember Jesus I rather have Jesus
[27:37] because if you have Jesus that's all
[27:39] that you need it's amazing the things
[27:42] that we spend on times trying to acquire
[27:44] to learn and to remember and somewhere
[27:47] Jesus ends up on a shelf or we just know
[27:49] it as a Bible on the Shelf somewhere and
[27:51] there is no attraction there's no Focus
[27:53] there is no attention but I thank God
[27:55] tonight that he gave us something to
[27:57] remember
[27:59] him that whenever we gather together to
[28:01] take the Lord's Supper it's a moment
[28:04] when we could look into the mirror of
[28:05] the word and ask ourselves the question
[28:08] Lord am I doing all I can do to remember
[28:11] what you did for me because I didn't
[28:13] deserve it Lord there's nothing I could
[28:14] have done to deserve it amen when I was
[28:17] at my lowest point you reach down and
[28:19] peel me up you can be here today if it
[28:22] wasn't for his grace if it wasn't for
[28:24] his love and all he is asking you today
[28:26] is to do this in remembrance of
[28:29] me don't do this to impress anybody
[28:32] don't do this because people expect it
[28:34] of you don't do this because it's a
[28:36] tradition to do it don't do it because
[28:38] it's expected to do it but you're doing
[28:40] it for a purpose that you can
[28:41] acknowledge that he's the same yesterday
[28:44] the same today the same
[28:49] forever doing it because if it was not
[28:52] for the grace of the Lord where would we
[28:55] be but the B I'm use that very statement
[28:58] in the message if it had not been for
[28:59] the grace of the Lord where would we all
[29:01] be this evening because we were born in
[29:03] sin we were shaped in iniquity and
[29:05] that's why sometimes we forget him
[29:08] because we get so caught up in the
[29:10] attractions and the distractions but God
[29:12] said when you come to the spot of the
[29:14] Lord's Supper forget everything else and
[29:17] remember
[29:18] me amen hallelujah you could take the
[29:22] whole world but give me
[29:24] Jesus you could have all the money in
[29:26] the world but give me Jesus you can have
[29:29] all the education in the world but give
[29:30] me Jesus
[29:32] amen amen one of the most solemn of
[29:36] ordinances that we could raise beyond
[29:38] our feeling our emotions our fears and
[29:41] come with sincerity saying Lord I'm
[29:44] putting you back in your right place in
[29:46] my heart right place in my mind I've
[29:49] I've been distracted amen you haven't
[29:51] been remembered I got up every morning
[29:53] this week and didn't pray I got up every
[29:55] morning this week and didn't read the
[29:56] Bible I got up every morning this we so
[29:58] caught up in life and work and
[29:59] distresses that really I I never
[30:02] remembered you Hallelujah I didn't spend
[30:04] much time thinking about
[30:07] you it's an honest
[30:10] question how much have you remembered
[30:13] the Lord
[30:14] lately we read books and we don't
[30:16] remember Jesus we listen to tapes and we
[30:19] don't remember Jesus but as we approach
[30:22] this Psalm you can begin to play
[30:23] something softly do this in remembrance
[30:27] of me can we bow our heads in a word of
[30:30] prayer our gracious Heavenly
[30:34] Father Lord
[30:36] this Lord exhalation to set the
[30:39] communion in
[30:40] order Lord to search ourselves Lord the
[30:43] scripture says let every man examine
[30:47] himself Lord your prophet in that
[30:49] message communion on December 12th 1965
[30:53] he said Lord the worthiness is not
[30:56] because of our our worthiness but you
[30:59] are the worthy
[31:00] one when we should have been dead you
[31:03] took our place and Lord we are so sorry
[31:07] to have forgotten
[31:09] that Lord when we should have been dead
[31:11] a long time ago we have life today
[31:13] because you live we are
[31:15] alive and Lord some of us have forgotten
[31:19] that we have held on to church and
[31:21] traditions and we have forgotten the
[31:24] real meaning of what this is all about
[31:28] that Jesus you are the reason for
[31:32] everything oh God help us today Lord
[31:36] forgive our past bless our
[31:40] future Lord may you reach into the
[31:42] sucket of every
[31:44] heart Lord as we search and examine our
[31:47] own lives Lord our commitment our Zeal
[31:50] our prayer lives our meditations Lord
[31:54] the way we wake up in the morning the
[31:56] way we go to bed at at night do we

[32:01] the world is caught up in their music
[32:03] and their Styles and the news and the
[32:05] Fashions we can't be caught up in that
[32:07] world because we are not of this world
[32:09] Lord help us to remember you oh God

[32:16] sacred moment father Lord God may you

[32:29] Lord as we approach this communion and
[32:31] wash one another's feet with humility
[32:33] just as you taught us to do Lord and
[32:36] your prophet he brought it so clear
[32:39] father Lord that this is something that
[32:41] we must do because father you said if
[32:43] you don't eat my flesh and drink my
