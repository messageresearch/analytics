out amen praise the lord amen uh trust how many appreciate the friday night's exhortation for returns i want to put that back up that you could hear it if you haven't heard it it's a tremendous blessing and i thank god for that so if you have your bibles this morning i'd like you to turn to two portions of scripture matthew chapter 20 we want to read from one to 16. and hebrews chapter 13 verse 8. so you want to read from matthew chapter 20 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that says as a householder so that is he's in charge of an estate which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vinya and when he had agreed with the laborers for penny a day he sent them into his vineyard and he went out about the third hour which is about nine o'clock and saw others standing idly in the marketplace and said unto them go e also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give it to you and they went their way again he went out about the sixth hour which is about noon and the ninth hour which is about three o'clock and did likewise and about 11 hour which is about five o'clock he went out and found others standing idle say it unto them why standing here all the idol note the object is to get them into the field and labor okay verse seven they say unto him because no man had had us he says unto them go also into the vineyard and whatever is right that shall he receive so when evil was come the lord of the vineyard says unto the servants call the laborers and give them the higher beginning from the last unto the first and when they came that were hired about the 11th hour they received every man a penny when the first came they supposed that they should receive more and they likewise receive every mana penny and when they received it the moment against the good man of the house saying these last have wrote but one hour and that was made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and the heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend i do no wrong this thou not agree with me for a penny take that time is and go that way i will give under this last image and disease it is is it that lawful for me to do what i will with my own is that an evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's pray father we thank you for your word and i pray that you break the bread of life to us take me out of the way that i be fully yielded to you and that you would speak what your people need to hear may they hear thus saith the lord this morning in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated go praise god such a blessing to have all of you here again and we say welcome oh blessed be the name of the lord and i think thank you for that inspiring song service so this morning [Applause] this morning of a title title is same holy spirit that's the title same holy spirit of an inspiration jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever another subject one word that's a subject i never had a one word subject before listening and this would seem it means as a synonym co-equal duplicate equal identical indistinguishable unchanging unchanged changeless on varian on varied constant consistent that is what this word c means so when we want the same it means just that to seem nothing less than the scene we read a parable when they talk about the cmp hallelujah that the first book has received is not something so let's continue let's start but abandon how beautiful it is on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell down from heaven he said our manner after we come to the blood we have been saved being cleansed from our sins and the holy ghost fell peterson on their pentecost it is for you and for your children and for them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call are you ready now and every person that enters into the baptism of the spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of pentecost not a different kind same same kind he said i believe to be god's truth not something that looked like it but the real thing the same kind of holy ghost that fell back there falls now the same kind do you believe it that's a question you have to answer do you believe it the holy ghost bring forth the same kind of evidence and proof that they had back there comes with the same holy ghost then brahms says hallelujah how good you see i like this yes i feel it right now that's right it's real it's just as real as it ever was to me that's right the same holy spirit that fell back there on the day of pentecost ocala real calvary jesus blessed and died for me then he tore the soul of his own son separated a covenant he throwed a body into the ground it lay there for three days and nights it rolls up for it is not possible that my holy one shall see corruption neither leave his soul in hell and his soul was a spirit that ascended into hell he rose god did pick up his body and give him life he took the body of jesus set it at the right hand in glory and send back the holy ghost as a covenant there you are so when jesus died soul went under hell to preach the soul in his prison isn't that right then god take the body put it up and release the spirit as a covenant are you ready don't fall short of that brother without the baptism of the holy ghost you are lost you won't have to worry about getting to heaven if there is nothing in here supernatural the doors can't unlock so to approach heaven's door you have to have something in you that is supernatural and that's the holy ghost oh praise god do you believe that the promise is not the joint church the promises to receive the same holy ghost that the early church received that's why god sent a prophet in the last days not foster books and tips and say we believe a prophet but to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers to turn our hearts back to what they had back there because they were on their way to eden they were adopted sons they had god in them they had the image of god inside of them that's why peter could say silver and gold have i known such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ they were fearless they believed god they had signs they had wonders they had miracles and the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word and we are promised as an alpha church he is going to be an omega church the same holy spirit same holy spirit to come back upon the sons and daughters of god in the last days to bring back that same ministry that he had when he left oh give the lord some praises this morning glory glory his soul went to god god blessed him then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify to clean up the mind to clean up the heart and leave a portion of the holy ghost and there so when the spirit sweeps through you clean up your mind clean up your heart and as it passed you leave a portion oh glory to god it leave a portion glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i know the enemy fight in my voice but that's okay we're gonna pump this world anyhow or give the lord some praises my god something gonna sweep through you clean up your mind clean up your heart and leave a portion how many won that portion today he promised to leave a portion inside of you a portion of himself in the upper room everybody got the lick of fire you're gonna have your own lick of fire you don't have to borrow fire from your husband you don't have to ball fire from your wife you're gonna have your own lick you don't have to barf high from the preacher you're gonna have your own lick you don't have to borrow fire from the elder or the deacon you're gonna have your own lick the same holy ghost the same fire the same power the same anointing here's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he does not change he is unchanging he is unvaried he is the same oh give the lord a shout in the house oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so let's say it again his soul went to go on god blessed him then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify to clean up the mind to clean up the heart and leave a portion of the holy ghost in deer here and here and when the holy ghost is given out the same holy spirit that brought the body of jesus out of the grave will rapture so this rapture is not a kind of imaginary thing it's what's inside of you is what going to be raptured your body going with that once the magnet of the holy ghost comes upon you and you have that magnetism of the holy ghost in you you have to go it is impossible not to go if you put magnet on the wood and where they're going no way but put the magnet on metal or nail or it have to stick up to it so that's what the holy ghost coming to do to pick you up that ufo coming to pick you up or give the lord a shout there'll be no way out all the bombs line up in russia already oh glory don't worry listen the material for world war iii they already have it they're not making it for world war iii it's coming armageddon coming famine coming pressure coming they they're locked down and closing them coming too they will close on the churches they're coming too but so is the rapture oh give the lord a shout in the house or give the lord some praises oh all kind of dreadness coming and may not feeling for fear for the things that coming on the earth but there's going to be a rapture let's continue so the same holy spirit that brought the body of jesus over to the grave with rapture and that covenant has the dovetail as he tore there and give the body and went back to god the spirit came back on earth here we go this is the path are you ready then your spirit will have to be the same kind of a spirit or it will miss that place of going together not because you make yourself not because something but because something the love of god has swept in your soul and tore every earthly idol out so it's not a question you stop smoking and stop drinking and stop running young woman is that that you know you stop doing this or you stop lasting no it's not that what you stop that you stop that but it's when this love when this spirit went this supernatural so we're not talking about joining church you go baptist methodist catholic church any church you want to go to but if something supernaturally happen you are the same person if you're not inspired out of what you in you are the same person you always was you something have to happen outside of you the bible said it this way and when the day of pentecost was fully come there when one man and one accord all of a sudden there was a song from heaven as a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting had no man inside a deer had no bishop inside idea it had no human interference inside a deer it was a song from heaven as a russian mighty pin and it filled all the house where they were sitting and tongues of fire came upon each and every one of them and they were filled somebody said film they were filled with the holy ghost they were filled with something oh glory to god hallelujah jesus already opened the word to them jesus already opened the understanding to them they needed more than that more than the opening of the word more than the understanding being opened up there needed something more than that he said wait and tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you hear where that power coming from that poison from your pocket that power isn't from your money that power isn't because you're old and your gray hair that power comes from on high that is coming from no pastor or no preacher that is power from on high this is the promise oh give the lord a shout this is a promise [Applause] not because you make yourself but because something the love of god has swept into your soul that throw every earthly idol out there it is and there is something breeds and calls to god it's your soul in here calling out to the heavenly father there you are that gives you a feet and you becomes the seed of abraham you believe god promised like abraham did do it lingered yet you believe it faithful abraham's talking about the promise of god true unbelief but was strong given praise to god praise be to jesus isn't that something tonight question brother branham i want to know the place where i can tie down and say this man has the holy ghost because he did this or this woman has the holy ghost because she did that question answer there's not a way in the world for you to know it that's right there's not a way in the world for you to know it god is a judge we are not to judge just preach the gospel a fellow came to me here long long ago i was preaching about what i said the other night he come to my house and said brother branham i wanted to get rid of my sins i want to be a christian he sat on my porch i heard about a great man the man saying this an internationally known man by the name of billy graham and i went to his meeting he said all that wants to become a christian hold up your hand accept christ as your personal savior so i raised up my hand i said no all stand we have a prayer i stayed and prayed just as sincere as i could be and that didn't do me any good he said when i went down to aura was meeting he said i heard of him and i heard they had all such joy so i went to orr's moral agency he went from billy graham to all of us now i asked him what must i do to become a christian he said you get back in here i told him i held my hand at billy graham he said you stayed there in that inquiry room in there until you are so happy till you speak in tongues i went in there i pray till i spoke with tongues i come out didn't do me no good he said when i went to another meeting they told me i hadn't been sanctified yet i have to get sanctified and get happy and shout get enough joy so i prayed and prayed and i shouted still i said brother this is barbara now every one of those things are correct every one of them are good hold up your hands speaking in tongues shouting i believe in every bit of it but yet that's not the thing it's accepting the person christ jesus these things are attributes shouting speaking in tongues running shouting crying praying whatever that attributes that follow the first thing is to accept the person christ jesus so there's no evidence that we could say because a man cries i've seen man cry and cried crocodile tears he's still just as a big sinner as he could be jesus like not says sheep is not right the shepherd knows his sheep anybody here a goat cry well brother you better be a shepherd if you're wanting a different dream a goat i'll go to a christ just exactly like a sheep let a little bitty goat get hung up there somewhere little sheep there that's the same i've heard them down on the altar crying crying oh god there's somebody like that oh god and i go to all the time this is the prophet talking about crying goats that's right shouting i've seen them shout till they run across the floor and jump up and down and shout you say brother madam you don't believe in crying don't take me wrong sure i believe in crying but i'm saying that is no evidence because they both cry i've seen them shout as hard as they could shout just carrying on like that and there's a long way you know what i'm talking about i hear them speak with tongues and go and live any kind of life just do anything that's no sign but you say you're against it no i am not i'm speaking in tongues it's god's gift to the church if i take it out i'll take all part of god out if i take my tongue my tongue with my body here i will have a complete body the body of cross of the body of jesus christ has tongues in it the body of jesus christ have tongues you take it out that's taking part of christ but it's accepting the person christ jesus and these other things come right on in and they fit together here we go let every member in this body this morning let this little group of people if we could pull the curtains down along on each side and every person in here received the peace in christ jesus listen there will never be a fuss there will never be no argument there'll be a perfect love yet you will still believe this and believe that each one accepting the person of jesus christ so then you'll be ministering from within that person that operational prison you will treat your brother right you will have no preference you prefer this one and your blood take this one and your blood can't stand this one you have no blood you have the blood of jesus flowing through you god so loved the world he loved sinners he loved prostitutes he loved drunkards he loved all of them praise god in that same love is what going to be working in you oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god i'll give you my estimation of what i think that's the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a christian than anything i know of you know what it is you say it's a travail of soul a person that is always so hungry and tasting for god they can't stand it simply dear night they've got to do something for god they got to do what something for god they are full of love they just soul travel travailing all the time he that go at fought in tears with doubtless return again bringing his she's behind him so i trust that this this answer this question and answer would help you praise god is it accepting the person of christ jesus amen so then he saw what intellectual fate you got to like your feet you believe the word and you mix it and make it suit your theology but once you come into the kingdom of god through the blood of the lord jesus meeting upon the shed blood brought through the testimony the public testimony of the you know you don't hear much blood preaching because people know the knowledge and so on but there's something else when you understand and they sing that song i know it was the blood one day when i was lost jesus died upon the cross understand not because you're handsome you're tall whatever god god call you no because the blood we only hear this morning because of blood a price was paid to give us this opportunity to hold on to our lifeline all also we in hell and loud this year we held in some kind of church somewhere but because of blood because of calvary calvary is still relevant the blood jesus chad is still relevant oh glory to god thank god for the blood oh praise god hallelujah praise god so let me go let's go let's go he said now watch you are here in fellowship may god can bless you that's through the blood you can shout and praise the lord and the powers of god working why it is god himself his own body the mystical body of the lord jesus christ here on earth operating here we go upon the basis of the shed blood that's why he saved the power of goddess to hit the church it wouldn't mean the prayers of the people it will be the grace of almighty god and if it recognizes grace for you and grace for your life you would recognize the grace for others oh give the lord our praise glory to god hallelujah because as soon as we get something we try to gouge the eye of somebody else out because we feel we saw right we feel we so on but you have to be careful that you have to recognize the same grace applied to you you have to apply to others praise god so it's not upon the basis of methodist or pentecostal church or any other church not upon the basis of water baptism though it's good it's right but not upon the basis of church joining joining church is good but it's upon the basis of the shed blood so when you strip it down now all the church joining baptismal that is external connections because somebody could go down will you go dry sin and come over with one after the woman wanted the same sinner because it says he basically shed blood and then holy ghost coming to to change your life and change your work because you know this is right and the fate that first come to you is intellectual faith because you're hearing the word you know that this is true the man was telling about him i want to be a christian you're not he want to be a devil you want to be a christian you don't want that temper with you you want to be a christian you don't want to be answering back your husband you want to be a christian you don't want to be a bullhead the politicians and christians are the same thing you want to be a christian you want to be a loving husband a loving father a caring person a person that have a compassion you want to be that kind of a way oh glory to god when that man woke up at five o'clock and said brothers what are you doing out here they're lying they idle you say what are you doing here there's no work to be done come on i'll go pay what is right oh glory to god god don't want an idol at least foolishness idea is killing time god over here wasting your time everybody at the same 24 hours what you do with yours oh glory to god he said come on work come on labor you will get paid pay time come now he said let the last let me get them out first praise god give them a penny praise god have a heavy then we start in the beginning started they expect them the expectation growing now they say they say two penny four penny ten penny will be my penny and when they come to the same penny somebody shout out saying oh god is saying penny they start to complain no they start to say oh god oh we see all the heat of the day we labor in long time i started here was black looking here looking gray and somebody just coming saturday and getting blessed and power of god striking them and hitting them he said oh god you can't judge me i choose to do this thing i say same pay the same what the apostles have we're going to have say saying pay what peter have we gonna have same pay it has to be the same i want nothing less than that don't tie me down to no churches say i'm some church member i want the same thing they had backed here that's what god's gonna profit for or give the lord a shout shout don't see him you want the same thing there back there this church going to appreciate till we have it oh glory to god hallelujah you hear me you hear me ministers praise god but isaac brothers praise god but anthony we're going to have the same thing don't drop shorter that don't preach less than that oh glory to god make sure you preach the same thing you say what the temps say don't throw it across because it's not me saying it it's the holy lord speaking it oh give the lord i shout glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to god and through the blood you may be seated you become part of him into the same cell he came out of and the very presence and path of god comes into you and by future purchase it that same holy spirit that was in the lord jesus christ comes into you then you are sons and daughters of god by the lord adopted by the lord jesus that's why he is the firstborn he

what he asks for is a heart thing he says the heart thing you know it's a big deal i have one person you ask for two you're greedy he's not greedy is he faith in his soul he needs a proportion we need an abortion too you know we need something for our body and something for your soul to leave here we need that too the mountain devils we had a fight we need we need two double portions we need plenty portions you know is that back line of war we in you know and then death is not easy then devil's waiting to contest you and to fight you and to battle you and you have to fight back [Music] [Applause] fell to the earth and the battle of angels became the battle of men and we still fight him the fight and sickness the fight and depression the fight and frustration you fight a lot of demonic activity by your neighbor house around your house or glory to accord in front of you behind you in the schools on the job is demon powers you have the light upon you and your co-workers upon them it's a battle is a warfare you're walking to hell on the earth but god is with you oh give the lord i shout in the house [Music] [Applause] maybe seated so look look at this you as a christian you with the light on you and every devil is spiritual i'm seeing that light on you and your co-workers and neighbors and family have devils on them they have darkness on them they're walking as spirits on them and you're talking to them as just flesh and blood and human but that's not just flesh and blood that's people on the influences and them spirits want to influence you to get you off of the light and to throw you into darkness but we said that devil is a liar and the house of hell after gives way to the name of jesus christ president you're fighting for your life i am fighting this morning to see the same holy spirit that was in the early church come back in this church we are fighting for revival we are fighting for your pouring we are fighting for praise god dynamics to the mechanics luther fought roughly fought the pentecostal fight and we are going to fight william branham fort you can sit there with a package message and have it easy come on fight for your life [Applause] when you're not worshiping you're not fighting when you're not worshiping you're not fighting oh glory to god when you start the praise god like abraham i miss your condition if i'm getting praise god when he got isaac he prays god for 25 years oh when isaac couldn't be seen touched or handled oh glory to god help me preach somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] could imagine elijah keeping his eyes off elijah that's what's our problem today with the church we got too many people that's got their promise you shall receive the holy ghost but they keep one eye on the world and the other one on god you're sure to fall take your eyes off one or the other i advise you to take your eyes off the world off your neighbor off your association and keep your eyes single with christ elijah kept his eyes on elijah and while the child of fine horses came long elijah stepped up on it and went up as he went up he pulled off his mantle and he struck the jordan to make the path to death he sent back the mantle and all this was in type listen that yeah the same holy spirit that was upon him fell on the church he said the things that i do shall you do also so elijah and elisha was an anti-type of christ and the bride so as the mantle fell upon eliza and elisha did what the same works elijah did he take the mantle hit jordan jordan open up he did what elijah did well christ released the mantle on the holy ghost upon the church that your church could do the same thing do you believe that do you see what we call to do praise the name of the lord my god a double portion of the same holy ghost does upon christ is upon the church watch and the people today who claim to be filled with the holy ghost and is afraid to trust god for to take brother cross children get on the other side a double portion of the holy spirit was upon christ jesus was sent back to the church to minister and to carry on the work until we come so we are sent by god to carry on the work till jesus come not just to minister in the preaching of the word but to the same works that he did do you believe that he was raised from the dead and in in his church tonight in spiritual form given to you every bit of powers he had when he's here on earth he's handed over to the church to use and you're afraid to use it i wonder if you took that last step have you really crossed jordan this is brother brown no watch praise peter jesus so then god took his son at calvary right throw him apart he took the body to heaven sent dong on his right on the right hand he sent the holy spirit out of him and the holy spirit back on the earth and here we go and the same holy spirit that was in jesus christ will have to be operating in his church to make them coincide together at the rapture holy spirit has to be what operate and shout out britain oh yeah i mean they can't just be ministered preaching no have to be operated every gift have to be back in the church tongues prophecy interpretations healings all of that discernment every gift let me say it good every gift will be operated in the church before we leave here is there no pastor preaching and we're just going to the rapture they're going to the tribulation they're preaching the tribulation saints i call them you see if we don't say this you wouldn't expect this and you'll be deceived you will think you're okay and you're by yourself and truly to be taken um i'm tuning back wanting one left and you're going you're going straight to the tribulation you have to understand god's requirement god's requirement is that christ come back in the church the same self same spirit so you have to want that when you come you're not coming to look for who come who are tall who changed their clothes from last week and who were in the same dress this week do you not come here for that i could wear this jacket all week whole month all year that i have nothing to do while we preaching i'm not coming here people close i come here to see a holy ghost pour out i come in and see the minister can't stand the minister because the glory of god filled the tabernacle glory glory to god i'm not coming here to explain to you all i study last night how nice it is and whatnot paul said my preaching is not with enticing words of my wisdom i come to preach in a way that you'll have faith in the power of god that could change and transform your life because what is the use of coming to church are you not being changed once you are coming to church you're not improving you're not being transformed your faith not being anointed [Applause] maybe seated think about anthony preach about our defeat is a journey and he's correct it's not their fate today and a change and tomorrow you're unchanged it's a journey paul said

god a whole difference will come you have the same 24 hours others have and there are people doing magic with the 24 hours the same holy spirit that was in jesus will have to be operating in his church his church which street that is does he change he says upon this rock i'll build my church what church is that that's revelation rock upon you so that means his spirit has to be operated in you i could give you a word he said by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised by and true hallelujah by and true he will take the bride and use her oh give the lord a shout you are going to be the temple of the holy ghost you are going to be god's operating center when god went to you somebody he finds you look at the lord i shout how many sees that this morning not called the

they have word open to them and they have the understanding open but now they have something called them staggering it's powerful and high have them staggering is not to take a tablet and have some side effects upon them they will stagger him because the holy ghost get him out i praise god and experience a fire a power coming to them is this striking home is it hitting anybody inside of here that you have a promise this is not a promise from the pastor this is a promise from the word [Applause] but i'm saying same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation is some glory to glory praise god that woman cover baby and don't know praise god she must go through some kind of experience hallelujah think about it now i'm a baby i don't know a baby something kind of wrong maybe another baby you have is a dolly praise god is something different but you have an experience of god you have to feel something you have to know something praise god but i'll say you know what i'm waiting on waiting on something all of a sudden the atmosphere changed he said he is here he is here the angel is here i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god and here praise god among the people every doomed devil on the run they're looking to be cast out they're looking to be called out he know he is a son in possession well give the lord some praises this morning hallelujah glory my god if the christian church today could believe the gift that god sent them the holy ghost the holy spirit is a gift to the church and the church turns it away and shuts it off from our doctrines our theologies and things our mind migrates what do they say is it exercising church we're going up and down from them we're making much of noise he'll have noise having noise we are making enough noise that people are standing here still they have dead amongst all this noise how much is you going to change with no praise and no worship i went to one already you know stone dead you know all these are funerals they need some catholic comics i'm smoking them smoking smoking just need a priest to come and do something than i smoked them out hallelujah i ain't signed up for that i am no catholic i was in the catholic church i signed up for no pre-smoking something you have a debt ceiling anything like that i ain't signed up for that i signed up for the excitement of this glorious gospel many wise men wouldn't like to be here but theo is here oh give the lord a shout glory oh hallelujah many prophets and sages would like to be in this age and some of you like a squingen like a sorry god saying yeah baby best thing to be in there's plenty thunder and plenty like no no plenty voices do you know oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god praise god praise god listen to this the devil got licks in every agent every every age you got blows you know by the elect caught a hood not the oil and the wine when they come up with this he bring the ox anointing he bring the man anointed he bring the land anointed he bring the eagle anointing to withstand us and sort of the devil on his last day god of a secret weapon the bride of jesus christ the devil don't know who she is where she is he's looking looking looking he's a church member church member he conquering churches demon powers conquering ministers conquering believers but there's going to be a pride and god put that pride in the silence he covered up for years but god going to rip the veil and unveil that pride oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah pull the veil off for your life praise god he said we shut christ out don't let the holy spirit come in no miracles no shouting no speaking with tongues no praises of god is not messages like that you know not our praise of god in that church if you say hallelujah people look back and say who's saying that if the holy spirit done that in the book of acts it will do the same thing today because the book of acts is not the acts of the apostles is the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles and it's the same holy spirit in the church today it would act the same way and give the same results why accept a substitute when the skies are full of reveal pentecostal power i don't want to shake and i want the holy ghost power come upon my life when that fire it moves and so god say take off your shoes mr man the place you own is my place that's holy grounds you're on go glory to god you can't do what you want and i'm telling you i'm going to rock this church that when you hit them doors you will come and you're humble they will come in here listen to instructions and recognize this is not your grounds this is not your house already a house of god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god praise god so when god send on the spirit back upon the church was to do what continue the work so the church that goes to be the bride of jesus christ will be baptized into that same spirit with the same sign same wonders no dry church leaving not that church leaving oh glory to god brother abraham said that pride will leave you shouting [Applause] time to leave daniel bright you don't even know where you're leaving to go home hallelujah the private leaving you're shouting you think elijah had any issue if you see me go because i leave him oh glory to god hallelujah he know he selected elisha put up left because you know the mantle will pick up the bride he said this message will fall upon the predestinated and that's who you are here this morning oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] so watch he was called the messiah because he was anointed with the holy spirit and any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah yet a little smaller god and someday when this body is resurrected i hope before that god can get a hold of a bunch of people and i love this quote that will manifest his power in every dimension that is supposed to be in let me study a little bit the prophet prophesied that missing limbs will be restored and he is praying he's saying that i i hope that god gets a whole bunch of people that will manifest his power in every dimension could imagine you missing a kidney and give unto you a kidney when you check the doctor you had one kid know here too hallelujah glory to god missing limbs could be restored i hear any amen light another i guess that is impossible when moses had to make a choice that god god said i make my mosaic he said i'm in charge of that you know i didn't want to develop devise him out i could twist your mouth i could open him out i could lose your tongue what else you have to complain about i am the designer i'm the original creator of these things so whatever you're talking about miscellaneous small thing what's up this era hallelujah she's an old woman that that them limbs are missing you know she entire body was transformed that she could come into her monthly cycle again because she was past the asia childbearing that is more than missing limb abraham was transformed sarah was so good-looking that our king tried to make taclocera he's getting interested to her wanted to drop down in his house and said restoring to my servant his wife the king saber he told me is his sister he said i know but i come to tell you every woman in your house is shut up until they restore back my servant his wife oh glory to god i know you're hard of hearing i come and talk to you hallelujah but i don't pray with my servants i suffer them to do no wrong when they were few saying touch not my anointing do my prophets know him glory to god i will take care of my sons oh glory to god oh give him some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to god he said the holy ghost you may be seated that in this day of intellectual conception that he might be the same holy spirit proved to us that he's still the messiah the same yes since then forever now the question is do you care what do you think about it it's been proven over and over do you care enough to believe do you care enough to confess your sins that you are wrong confess your unbelief and accept it do you care enough to accept that he cared enough to die and rise again to bring it to you do you care enough to accept it oh my we ain't got time to get to all it all but you see that he cares he died that you might care that you might have a way he brought that way oh my blessed be the name of the lord amani christ has a sharp sword and watch it comes from his mouth and here is the bomb the living word so we have the written word and we have the living word which is the spoken word like he said the moses go stand there and hold the second call for flies and there was flies whatever he said he done it it come to pass his living word god and his word is the self same person god is the word and you know we keep saying that but really and truly how many people really believe that that this written word is god in print god put himself in print form called the bible as a written word and you could have faith in that written word and see god manifest himself so they could look back at scripture dania said i read of books that daniel wrote and i saw how much years to be delivered to babylon so he could refer back jesus can look at sea ice and shall not suffer my holy sick eruption or lead his soul in hell he can look and see what david wrote that's the written word and he could take the spoken word the living word and says destroy this body and treat this i'll raise it up and he is saying that based upon the written word that his body cannot see corruption it takes about three days for your body to be to get corrupt so he can take the written word and prophesy based upon what the word is written because the word is god and god can't lie oh give the lord a shout we know in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word made flesh and dwelt among us therefore god and his word is a self-same thing it is god in print form hallelujah and i believe there's bible to be the word of god it's god in print form then if it is god in print form you can receive it into your heart and then the holy spirit waters that seed and brings forth exactly what this promise and any kind of seed you know why because every word is a seed once it's common god's mouth is a seed so you could listen to confucius do you see us whatever any philosopher that's not god's word that is man talking philosophers and plato and socrates and whatnot that is philosophers and we could even tell it about putin in the part of our simon that is not god talking like socrates and plato and them fellas talking but you see when god speak and you receive his word that's a seed solomon is the sower and the seed is the word and once you get it out of god's mouth the spoken word that's original seed because it comes to the mouth of god and if god said you'll be delivered there is no definite hell to stop your deliverance i don't care what you have done i don't care where you have been i look at what sins you have done let god say your time has come your time has come nothing could stop that listen to this now so watch any kind of seed you sow it's a big word of a crop exactly we have sowed in this great revival a lot of intellectual seed we got an intellectual crop that's right if we were so gospel seed we would have a gospel crop we need to get back to the principles and the bible teachings back to the bible back to the holy spirit upon the word that makes the word live for the prayer now we see these signs as we see the ministry from christ beginning to narrow up now to the complete ministry in the fullness of the holy spirit homa under luther it was the same holy spirit justification the baptismal spirit now notice when a baby is born his three things contin consider but we know water blood and then life and the same thing that constitutes a new birth water blood and spirit the elements that come from his body is what make up the bride now let's not beautifully bring this in here now blood water blood spirit justification to believe in water sanification through the blood the baptism of the spirit now he's going to hook him to the baptism of the spirit and these are the words now this last great step what is he talking about the baptism of the holy spirit this last step must come into the perfection [Music] so he's pulling the baptism out of 1906 out of the pentecostal ensuring this thing called the baptism of the spirit has to come into perfection what is he saying it has to add the certain things it has to go up into charity full to your knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness right that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly so we can't get away from it no no man until somebody says again fix and somebody get upset and set up politics and again fight and you get them fight and fight and fight take a fight home this is not a place for that kind of fight this is what we have to have here that the holy spirit has to live in the church so perfectly it will make the head and brother body unite together that's the body he's the head oh my praise god so he said you know the grain seed in the original phillips nicer isn't that right now the life come out of the original grain come to different processes and turns back to its original condition so when you put on a seed a corn seed up comes not a corn you see a stalk and that begins to grow and you see leaves and you see growing stronger and stronger now the seeds have a life the life unfolds through processes but it's going up to bake a reproduction of the original in multiplied form so you plant one seed but you see in the growth process you can't say that the seed you have a leaf you have a stalk if you cut it you have no fruit to get you have to let it go through the process god's process for seven ages seven seals that is the bible but when it comes to the turp it get back a corn it have a shock along it it have green thing around it but in that hub have seeds and when they leave it long enough they get back a reproduction of the original grain in multiplied form oh glory to god so what god did on the day of act book of acts under their pentecost he plant the original seed on the day of pentecost and that seed went to the ground and that's he began to unfold itself first church age second church age third church age four churches fifth church eight six churches seven aged and here we are we push past the number seven and we are the bright age and in this bright age you're seeing a reproduction of the original grain in multiplied form same life same signs same holy spirit same yesterday today and forever oh give the lord a shout do you see it today oh glory to god and he said one went to make the other justification made away for certification certification made a way for the baptist holy ghost and the baptist holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself oh give the lord some praises my lord my lord my lord my lord my god we are teaching rain seed sowing rain but the word of god has been sown also mushroom seed have been shown and hear the prophecy and always bringing this back and don't fear that stale you know this estelle to me you know because god still promised it he said when the spirit of god begins to fall the word of god will live in the people oh give the lord a shout the secret is the word is and the bride we are pumping them promises into you we are prophesying into you we rented the angel we took the book we eat the book we are prophesying from the book i'm giving you prophecy of the prophecy of the prophecy is if you're going to receive it and get the word inside your soul get your word inside your heart don't let no birds take it away don't let the light choke it or give the lord a shout about your water with your praises when the spirit of god begins to fall listen then we'll be living the people right here what else is going to happen in the spirit falls when they spread forwards they'll come and move among the people them the normal nationals will swing together just as certain as i'm standing in the pulpit and the church of god will be ousted so the anointing that comes not only come for it to live in you but it coming upon to enforce the mark of the beast the shortening of the churches that preach this kind of message it will be christ reproduced it could be joseph again rejected it will be christ again rejected god's masterpiece in the bride hallelujah do you believe that watch remember there will come such a international gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together in this federation of churches and this kind of church will be put out of our operation as far as they know so closing down this building doesn't mean they're closing on us they can't close young the bride which is christ in you because wherever you go christ is going to oh glory to god hallelujah so they will close us down as far as they know all right it's at that time that jesus will appear and he will show which is by them which is not and remember christian friends i'm a man i can make mistakes but god being god you cannot make a mistake all the words have been written must be fulfilled and jesus said so this must be fulfilled that is one thing this boycott to come it's a boycott coming right but before this boycott has come before it come of the market of the beast there's got to be a seed sown so god could take a church out of it so god couldn't take the pentecostals because they rejected the word and they didn't have the seed so god sent a prophet to reveal the son of man the sower of the good seed to put seed in you because the seed in you is what god coming back for oh glory do you see it by the jesus christ before the boy could come you may be seasoned before the closer is done before they shut us down and say okay i preach we have to have a seat soon to get the bride out oh glory to god they have to have a wrapped in faith seat so because i take more faith than normal to leave here isn't that right so before this boycott can come of the marking of the beast there has got to be a seat shown for god to take the church out brother continue now almost done music on please now remember malachi 4 the message come to terribly of the lord right that never happened with john okay now watch he is going to take the faith restore the fate of the children back to the original pentecostal tree that the canker won't eat up roman conqueror caterpillar all the denomination creates it down god said i'll restore it again in the last days and it will be restored god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted words that will restore this part is important and but the parents talk about it in the promising exhortation he couldn't send the holy ghost the person of the holy ghost upon the pentecostals because they didn't have wood [Music] i like how the terminology used here upon planted wood now you could have corn on top of this dessert right now in a bag and you know how the plan is going you know you're putting in the back pocket how the plan is going you know dino planted corn nice corn in your pocket that's corn in a bag until that corn going to the ground it's just gone the other day sometimes they find some corn or something from egypt hundreds of years old and they planted it and grow so you could have it in storage and remain intact with the life inside of it so when he said planted wood this thing have a people to receive it this would have to come in you so all these years you have to preach this word which is precious promises you're fighting up you're struggling but we preaching that word the word was in the disciples you say father they have received that word and peter was going deny him dice human spirit and mess up things but the word wasn't peter peter couldn't be he can't be undiscipled he's no longer disciple he's a denier i don't know him at all say but you look like you when the church up there are churchill i think i saw you they even welcome you on sunday morning and welcome you to the church said i i don't know i don't know about you i don't know i never went there and when the third time when they called pete out he said the curse then he said no he can't be a christian christian then peter wept italy peter went bitterly because he couldn't handle it but you see jesus getting licks he's injurious going crucified he said i can't handle it when peter time comes he said don't let me close the valley tell me upside down you ready to face the music now why you power him and god promised you that no no no not yet that same shout out god promised you that same power not another kind you know same kind power to strengthen you power to be the inner man but when they beat you and try to stop you you can still come to church power and rain falling you can still personally come to church and don't use that excuse rain falling they can't come to church no no no no use a dry weather question what kind of question is that put on a coat put an arm below whatever you had to do get the church oh give the lord some praises don't stay human backslide get in the church glory to god hallelujah let's go national force will put the church in the world conquered churches but the power of god will put the people in the pride do you want to be in a bride i'm going to close but seven asian messages to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same pay so we could be viewed as the people that got a five o'clock offer to work for one hour and when pay time come simply jesus taught it he said there were some people went into the harvest they were hired early in the morning to receive time a penny for the day that is what they up what they accepted the contract was i accept to work for the day for a penny right and at noon time someone has come in went to work then we left our last hour of the day because after that hour five six darkness you know it can't work in the dark it's like the final all these these guys come who was lying who was idle they wasn't there when the children were built he was they wasn't there before they leave all he had said now and they come in last watches and so perfectly what does someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they had at the first holiday it was so perfectly how the first hour messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth they came into their pentecost and there was a dark age that blocked them out at the middle of the day luther wesley and them came in and then there's to be an even time message to receive the same thing that he did at the beginning the evening time message is to restore back again to bring back the same thing again hallelujah and the prophet said oh my praise god thank you jesus know how the church has said some in the church to the libertines how they get tremendous sometimes when a church has grown in under the persecution of the outside world believing in the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was to pentecost how they grown and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists and given today are speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of healing all kind of miracles what must you believe in that the holy ghost is just as real as when it had at a pentecost it's the same holy ghost don't let no man preach otherwise to you than that promise may the lord bless you praise god i love you praise the lord amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] do you
