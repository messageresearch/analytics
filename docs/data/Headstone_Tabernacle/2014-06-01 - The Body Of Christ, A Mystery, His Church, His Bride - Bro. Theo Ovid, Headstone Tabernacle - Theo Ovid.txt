prayer father god we thank you for your presence lord your presence we are absolutely nothing lord we love you we thank you for first loving us and given this opportunity that we could respond to your love you have loved us before the foundation of the world are we thank you for your grace and your mercy and your blood that give us this opportunity as lord time fades into eternity as we see the closing of our age the closing of the era the closing of time itself people our hearts tonight people our hearts today to receive from you speak to us we wait upon you then jesus and we ask it amen you may be seated hallelujah we want to uh welcome yvonne and all right god bless you welcome head son tabernacle invited by our brother michael williams we say welcome to the headstone tabernacle well it's good to be here about three weeks a long time i think this is the longest i've been away from the church into cameroon and then uh i wasn't there for the last service because i slip out to go to pennsylvania and what a what a time i really want to thank the brethren who invited me the burden from indiana pennsylvania new york i have some meetings in pier uh last weekend there was really some that was inspired of the lord and to me just supernatural and what was powerful to me is what unfolded after the meetings that they don't know yet but they'll know today because the lord really dealt with me and uh give me something to share that is very important both for the morning service and the evening service so after the second service there'll be no communion we have the evening service three o'clock but there'll be no communion but i preached this morning and this evening also both services are very very important i believe uh is kind of mind-blowing when i saw what i saw um cameroon was mind-blowing and a tremendous blessing thank you for your prayer one particular message that stood out for me was a preacher about loose ends and abram came to tie up all the loose ends it was really really powerful like no certain message just tap the loose ends and you need the loose ends to tie up so that the power could flow in because man was once powered by the power of god there was no loose ends he was he was complete and the power was resident in man then the devil come and and and started breaking things up and all the power just leaked right out so either tie up the loose ends that the power could come back because god don't want that power to leak back out so he brought it from the word and then he brought it to your personal life that you have some loose ends to tire and the loose sense is where the devil gave you all those punches and so on and once you tap those loose ends then god could pour his life his spirit his power into you so that was such a tremendous blessing amen and by god just about to contain a mighty way in the military of the spirit so we really appreciate those meetings and trust then i don't have the dvds but as we get them we will be able to play some of them and put them on the website and also uh pennsylvania also but we have the meetings in pennsylvania and i know it would be a tremendous blessing i was inspired to bring something to them about another people in the land i got the scripture from ezekiel chapter 24 and it says thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he had done shall he do and when this cometh he shall know that i am the lord god and thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters for he that escape it in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall the mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb thou shall be assigned unto them and they shall know that i am the lord and i spoke about the escape ones the group in the last days the escape on the overcomers escape the corruption that is in this world true loss you have to be an escape one escape the church system except your neighbors escaped false anointed escape the pope the beast the roman system excrete the world the things of the world you become an escape one in this last day when you begin to see how you have escaped then you could shout and praise and glorify god remember peter said having escaped the corruption that is in the world to lust that's lust for anything not just sex that's an over desire for money for popularity for fame for power you name it once that lust is there you have to escape all of that so you have to see yourself as an overcomer because the prophet said many groups gonna stand but there's only one group gonna remain the bunch of overcomers praise that's not a certain church that's individual it's not going to be in that group oh glory to god you believe that hallelujah praise god and i got a bomb and i never saw before and studying preparing could always ask the lord what to say i really don't just drink i'm not a topical preacher this kind of topic i'm preaching it i preach what god lay upon my heart and i feel his present tense to the people and i got a bomb from brother branham and he's in mind he was saying bob america being finished i wouldn't read it here but he says this message shall go to another nation and another people i never saw that before blow my mind out you know title was another people in the land praise the name of the lord who are they the escape ones oh glory to god hallelujah that's how i feel i feel about escape they almost hold it but i'll escape hallelujah hallelujah glory to god how many know they have escaped this morning hallelujah you gotta escape now devil almost had you but you cut out you broke out praise god a big jail break the devil tried to bang you but you broke out oh hallelujah blessed be name of the lord praise the name of the lord and those who can't break out we're going to break them out house of hell gonna give way to the name of jesus christ there are those that can't break this heave out we're going to boss them out we were raised up for this purpose oh give the lord i shout i pray are you free this morning i feel that you are free this morning oh glory hallelujah oh glory to god amen and the second message that priest was in stone the bill is rejected oh hallelujah praise god and identify these escape ones all the escape ones they had to be rejected by the church the church have to kick them out cut them out excommunicate them because the stone the bill has refused they have to refuse it first before you become the headstone they have to reject you first they have to reject your mechanics they have to reject you for who you are doesn't protect you from where you come from come on save and you come from god you're going back to god but you are the bride oh glory to god oh you talk about the revival coming praise god hallelujah didn't see nothing yet we only about to get started oh hallelujah glory to god amen you may be seasoned identify joseph joy the perfection the capstone word mounted upon a bride rejected who is joseph the word that he can work through rejected or give the lord some glory and you are the word he can read what through oh hallelujah you were channels of communication for the spirit to flow fairly that's who we are that's who you are that's what you call for oh glory to god as joseph was rejected jesus was rejected the bride will be ejected but the stone the bill has refused hallelujah god said this is the day that the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it because god set us up that way oh give the lord some glory people i feel his presence in the building oh hallelujah oh glory it's wonderful it's wonderful it's wonderful it's wonderful amen and amen and amen well this morning i'll give it a title first this morning uh the title is the body of christ a mystery his church his bride this evening the title is the body of christ a mystery individuals the individuals that's first and that's how the lord show me to do it split it the church and individuals and when i saw what i saw i blessed the name of the lord god of israel all the things i taught was church is not church oh you're going to find out what the real church is this morning could we stand and give the lord a shout first of all thank you jesus i just want to thank you thank you lord let's sing that song before we go into the world that you know lord i just wanna thank you one more time praise your prayer praise praise you jesus hallelujah i just want pleasure praise you praise you now you praise him in your own way hallelujah hallelujah glory i'd like to turn your bibles to chapter 4 colossians chapter 1 and first corinthians chapter 12. first scripture reading read in ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 to 16. and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the early fine of the body of christ till we all come in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man unto the measure of the status of the fullness of christ that we hence what we know more children tossed to and through carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slay of men and craftiness whereby the lying way to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is ahead even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplier according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body onto the edifying of itself in love colossians 1 reading verse 16 to 18 speaking about jesus and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have oh sorry uh from 16 so i'm sorry first colossians 1 16 for by him were all things created that in heaven and that an earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and last scripture from first corinthians chapter 12. i want to read verse 13 it says for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we bond or free and i've been all me to drink into one spirit let us pray father god we thank you for your word and i pray you will interpret it to the hearts of the people father god you know what you place upon me and i pray that you give it to me that i give it to them may you bless it and confirm your word with signs wonders miracles and deliverances and jesus might ask it amen amen you'll be seated praise god hallelujah and my inspiration is from matthew 16 when jesus asks the question who do men say either son of man and then he asks his only disciples who do you see that i am and peter said that what the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered this is verse 17 of matthew 16 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are those i'm about jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee the dog peter here we go and upon this rock i will build my church okay i'll backdrop but a brand name for a message called life the cars in that day will be shaped like an egg running back like this form here and it'll be controlled by some kind of power that won't even have to use the steering wheel at times just set her and go like that see before the annihilate the annihilation you remember that that's on record a woman will take over woman will take over i've always said it will take the united states right here the worship of a woman from 17th week of daniel now the fifth thing brother branham 1933 had seven visions which he said must come to pass before jesus come again he's talking about the fifth vision the sixth vision is the woman the seventh vision is when america was bummed up and smoke and so on listen to the fifth vision science will progress in such a way until they will make a car that will not have to be guided by a steering wheel and the cars will continue to be shaped like an egg until the consummation the end time i seen an american family going down the road in a broad way riding in a car with their backs turned towards where the wheel should be it looked like they were playing checkers or cars he says it's controlled by a remote control by radar they won't even have to have any steering wheel in it just set your dial like you dial your phone your car takes you right on to it it can't wreck or nothing no other cars the magnets keep the rest of them away from you see they got it i predicted this 30 years before it happened and the reason i'm reading this because this week passed about four days ago google who have been working on uh driverless cars cars that you don't need to drive and so on they just released a prototype and they had demoed it it's just like an egg just like the prophet said just curved like like an egg and they said it's like that shape so it have no blind spots and they dismiss the steering wheels they say they don't need any steering wheel there's no pedal they don't need no brakes you just because they're the computer and the the reader whatever and so on will control the whole thing now google have been doing this for a couple of years now and they have a car chalked up seven hundred thousand miles a lot of miles without one accident the car could stop at the red lights move on no a child is wrong all the sensors are there in other words you don't need to drive it and it's safer than human beings who looking on the road and so on i'm saying this because brother branham said this going to be before the confirmation or before the annihilation it's already here they don't need the steering wheel and i saw it the person was driving it that a blind person or somebody else and it just pressed it just one up the press you set where you go in the press and they say your phone will be to call the car bring the car to you so it's impressive what the prophet says it's kind of mind-blowing so i said i'll drop that in you and this is what the news said if you're on an easy of this is just about two three days ago at the idea of rising in a vehicle that drives itself just wait till you see google's new car it has no gas pedal no brake no steering wheel google has demonstrated its driverless technology for several years by retrofitting toyotas lexuses and other cars with cameras and sensors but now for the first time the company has unveiled a prototype of its own cute little car that look like a cross between a volkswagen beetle and a golf cart they won't have any steering wheel accelerating pedal or brake pedal because they don't need them google said in a block spot unlike previous models these cars won't have human drivers monitoring them all the time google says the cars can detect objects up to 200 yards away in all directions adjust their speed tune and break in accordingly no driver no brakes so god send a profit and it doesn't matter how long it takes to come to pass whatever that prophet said it's going to come to pass because the prophet goes up in the spirit goes into the future comes back and ball does say at the lord he's not telling you what's not going to happen he's telling you what already happened because he seat by vision praise god it got to come to pass and that prophet said i believe the bride is called he already see you called i believe i am sealed into the kingdom of god you already see you sealed oh glory to god how many believe that this morning hallelujah praise god that means that you're you are going to be delivered oh glory to god amen hallelujah say inspiration i will build my church the rebuilding of the church by the spirit in the last days but the brand i'm praying dear god one by one we are called one by one we have to meet the challenge to walk down through the valley of the shadow of death it's due to every one of us as mortals but tonight you have offered us your petition that if you would believe on him and be baptized in his name you will take us in then in this body the body of christ not in church but in the body of christ that body has already been judged it will not have to come to judgment god poured out his rat upon that body and that body is free from sin and being in him puts us free from sin by his atonement that died for us and in deer we have fellowship one with another while the blood of jesus christ god's son keeps us clean from all sin and judgment god at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation may the waters from the altar of god gush down upon this morning upon your church and water it lord for the season just about finished give it life the waters of life that it might be able to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened for your great ghana father i pray for them but this talk must dry so i cannot pray for it it must die so it is dead but i pray for the wheat lord that's forming into the body of christ god grant that the fresh waters of god will keep its cheek bait with tears of joy and understanding until the combined comes to take it home in jesus name i commit to you the results is yours amen and amen oh what a prayer oh hallelujah can't pray for the stalk he can't pray for the shock but he can pray for you the seed that the water will gush upon you as the body of christ is being formed you mean the body of christ be informed yes oh hallelujah choosing a bride brother branham and we find out what he said now notice a nun in the catholic church that woman to become a nun i'll be going good it takes a last veil she's absolutely so low to that church soul body spirit property of that church she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last veil no mind of our own no will of our own you see how satan make them bogus the true church of christ the bride is so sold out in him and his promised word till the very mind that was in crisis in you that's how the bride have to be oh praise god we find out today that the modern church modern world church the modern world church and also the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to sons are you with me we're going somewhere this morning oh hallelujah praise god so they are pregnant both churches one of them is that the nominational birth is going to give one of these days to the world cultural churches and will produce the antichrist true denomination that's exactly the truth i may not live to see it i believe i will but you young people remember that you heard the minister say that it will finally wind up that the mark of the beast when she forms that world comes to the churches she will give birth to her son the antichrist the other by the word of god will bring forth the body the finnish body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that oh hallelujah glory to god so you get the title now praise god the body of christ his church his bride hallelujah and god going to bring forth that body oh give the lord some praises people how many knows that he said a man and a woman is one ah here we go christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again oh man like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word oh praise the lord hallelujah supporter brown and blue paints he said now the message is to bring the word malachi 4 bring the people back to the word watch a bird is to be she is to be delivered of a new bird according to malachi 4. in the church world today there are two systems working not three not four not five just two it's either god or that ever a time no in between it has no in-between man it's god on one side and the devil on the other side i look at the devil holds the bible and wear a tie praise god god is the word and the devil is anything author of the word come on say him and somebody there is no in between heavy church there is no in between oh give the lord some glory go hallelujah hallelujah our religious spirit is from hell amen when paul was saying i want you to put up a line and put up with this he was not talking to unbelievers it's jewish people he's talking to let him that sees stole no more do this do that it's not unbelievers he talking to it's church people you're talking to oh hallelujah when he rebuking is that unbelievable he rebuking church people oh come on come on don't don't just watch me no say amen say amen somebody now watch we all know it listen i want you to get this it's the word of god and the nominational system there are two systems at work esau and jacob one after the spirit and the other after the flesh and they are fighting one another it's been so denominational and the word and then he said no it's always been that way and the reason they are bearing pains because there's a fight in her there's esau a man of the world very religious good fellow clean moral but he don't know nothing about the birthright he's born that way and jacob i don't care what he is what he wants the birthright he's the spiritual one and two today is in the womb of the church that's the great big system trying to be formed called the world council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming for two children the word here we go must deliver the word bright church come on now you mean baby coming baby coming i i i'm not hearing you oh i am here a baby is not coming you're not pregnant but the baby is coming i've been waiting a long time babe in the womb a long time oh hallelujah hallelujah let's go here we go them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out on the wood that they come to put that they come out on like your feet coming out to your head she gets greater the more you have as the body grows up so the body of christ grows up and then finally the head will come to it and it's all linked to the head the head does the pulling so what i want to say to you today is this where i'm standing on this platform let's put this platform as the top of burglary kindness there that means we are on the top of the ages that means the majority of bride that makes up the body is already cold come on now come on now god is not now getting a list and say i better start to make up the body this is finishing the body this is finishing of the seventh seal this is finishing he promised to gather all things in christ both in heaven and earth so let's look at it now the majority of the bride is below it was so bad that god allowed the prophet to put a little light to represent the bride in the last days christ is the head let's say this is the head coming down here now so the head is coming down we are in between which will put us in the rainbow the holy spirit slot with the head coming down and the bride below the majority of them then we have to be stones called out to be fitted and by the bomb set it this way to make the headstone that he could come into it making day below without us they can't be perfect because we complete them glory to god hallelujah hallelujah my god oh glory to god when i begin to see this in the spirit realm when i begin to see the magnitude of what god was doing all along how we called the jews as a people and he came unto his own his own receive him that so he had to tale from the jews and go to the gentiles and paul was an apostle to the gentiles and he said the cross break the petition between the jews and the gentiles and now by one spirit we are baptized into one body the body of christ his church the same boat in the same field water by the same water same sunlight one is the word one is not the word and the two are fighting they have been fighting since the first reformation they are still fighting there we are there you are what system are you in hallelujah oh glory to god just imagine now if you would have lived back in the other day under the jolting of god's prophets and words that come forth what side would you want to be on back there you got the same choice today she is fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for a word bride and as a woman is part of a man taken from him so the church would have to be a word abiding church every word of the bible not systems not dogmas no watch they build so many systems around the world until when the prophet comes it shakes them notice whenever god comes on the scene it rocks the system that people are custom worth because god has like a oddball to shake things up different kind of style different kind of preaching different kind of blast and bastard shaking they will hate such a man but when a man hears from god god give him vision god give him purpose god give him ambition because he hear from god you may be seated no watch so when the prophet come she had birth pains what was it back to the world back to the life systems doesn't have a life it's only god's word have life systems are built around it it doesn't have life so if the system say everybody else falls and you not system then you see everybody as false if the system say everybody blue then you see everybody blue because the system said that but what does the word say then people who in the system have questions about the word but the bride have no questions because as a husband i made the reveal where once the word is revealed that's your husband you want to kiss him you want to hug him you want to hold him because that is your husband come on say him and somebody oh give the lord some glory give the lord some prayer so watch came unto his own rejected go to the gentiles what do you think happened this last day read revenge chapter three behold i stand and don't knock what they do they kick out christ he's outside he says let me man hear my voice not church now individuals oh glory to god oh hallelujah we're going to deal with that in the evening service if any man hear my voice and open up i'm going to minister to him oh glory to god he will open his mouth to the escape once oh hallelujah oh glory why why why because they're going to come on famine in the last days for the hearing of the word of god then god going to speak direct from god you're going to hear direct from god god will open his mouth to the escape ones not to the deceived ones no no escape ones escape the reception oh hallelujah oh glory they're gone so therefore systems are built around the life but only the word that give life watch something a little group will come out and believe in noah's time there's eight people god rock the remnant and destroy the rest of them to rock away but the brandon preacher message called five definite definite identifications of the true church of the living god and when god opened up certain things to me i didn't know it was spoken so it was a real excitement to find where the prophet spoke it whole glory to god listen to brother branham he said the word church and in this case i want to speak to you what is the church who set it up what is its message how do we become a member of it and can we get to heaven without being a member of it and that's how we approach this message and we just go along now the first place the word church itself means they called out now israel was not the church as long as they were in egypt they were the people of god but when god called them out of egypt they become the church of god so god was always interested in having church in his program of vision of church because they would have called out now that still remains the same today the word church means called out ones those that have been called out separated made different now when the old testament the church was known as the kingdom of god i love that saul is king and david is king and kingdom means king over domain that's where i get kingdom king ruling in the domain king was the head the people were under him when it switched to the church christ is the king and he is the head of the body the church but in the church he become the cap to you the pyramid come on now then the bride becomes his body oh glory to god are you with me so the bride is not just the bride the blood is not just saved people the bride is the body of christ my my mind and that body is a mystery hallelujah that body that we are preaching about today is a mystery let's continue now watch in the old testament church was called the kingdom of god i'm talking from the colonies of the bible old testament the church was called the kingdom of god in other words god is a king the church is his domain and in the new testament it is called the messiah empire he said i like that messiah in other words where the messiah rules and reigns no denominational buyers or nothing the messiah rules in his empire is not wonderful the messiah uh empire therefore the church here we go is not an organization let's go down deeper now the church is not a gardener people the church is the people of god that's been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom oh hallelujah this centuries member scattering the silverware in another kingdom that's why jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me but my kingdom is not of this world oh give the lord some glory give the lord some praise as people and we belong to that kingdom hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my god my god as i travel around the world i find every nation has its own spirit all nations are controlled by the devil all governments are ruled by the devil pick anyone i want to repeat that all nations are controlled by the devil governments are ruled by the devil the bible said so they fight the war and they will till jesus come is one king demon who in charge of this nation fight the next king demon in the next nation and they're fighting his demons having their own show that has nothing to do with our kingdom oh right now russia making a move and china making a move and japan saying this and north korea trying to serve this and we are heirs of the whole earth what are you saying you are possessors often seen and unsealed what are you saying you are called the possessive case of the enemy what are you saying you are called to be overcomer what are you saying let's go when you go into germany you find a german spirit you go into england you find the english spirit you're going to sweden you find a sweden spirit swedish spirit you go into france you find a french spirit you come to america you find an american spirit but when you're born of the heavenly spirit their spirit is no more come on now no more american no more german no more swedish no more french it's by one by one spirit baptized into one body there is one lord there is one faith there is one baptism and there is one body the church his bride that's a mystery oh glory don't call him man are you in the church triumphant are you when the savior's pride come and be baptized into the body oh hallelujah hallelujah many thought that they were in the body till the holy ghost had come church jesus had a failure right in front of me i see two side of theory i see the kingdom i see the people of every nation every tongue every people baptize into the body no man could control let's not go there oh glory oh they could control church but not the body come on say man somebody oh not that woman that jesus woman that's jesus bride that's jesus church oh hallelujah she won't be manhandled oh hallelujah watch they are born of a heavenly spirit their spirit is no more americanized it's no more germanized it is heavenly lies but i'm saying that the new word it is heavenly lies for the kingdom of god because we are in another kingdom a kingdom of god where decency holiness and power exists we have access to our king we have an interview with him whenever you want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but one man christ jesus so we are living in a kingdom it is called the messiah kingdom in other words where the messiah rules in every life in his dominion rule in the lives of his people are called out people from every walk of life gather him together in a group that he calls it his church his called out ones it's a beautiful thing so israel was the people of god until they were called the church of god isn't that right and now the church of god today is the same thing called out of everything of the world called out of a religious cult called out of every religious denomination call it of every religious organization to walk with god not being governed by a bishop but being governed by christ in this messiah kingdom that we live in christ is the king now christ here we go is the head of this so when you don't want headquarters you know what you're talking about now right he's head in the headquarters christ is the head of this christ is the head of this messiah kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which christ is the head i want to have a bigger amount on that you cannot organize a kingdom on which christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which christ will govern he is not a ceo he is not a cfo he is not a manager he is not a director he is the king of his domain of his kingdom even the messiah empire oh and we shall chronic king of kings and lord of lords oh you are free this morning my god you're free this morning i feel the freedom in here this morning oh glory to god it's a great thing to be free no chains binding you nobody holding you down nobody holding you back we have no enemies on the outside no church keeping us back no man keeping us back oh glory glory glory glory glory let's go therefore you cannot take the intellects of a man and make an organization to which christ will govern therefore here we go buddha brown any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god is going contrary to the king and if they're going to contrary to the king it will be against the king and if it's against the king it would be antichrist what abandons it that's pretty rough if i had a little more voice we would make that clear it is antichrist or antichrist however you want to say it it's the same thing oh can we give the lord some praises and if you will bear with me a few minutes i'll prove it now we talk about two birds right one is the word i wanted any guy spirit true organization no organization in the spirit but branham an antichrist spirit tries to take the people and call them from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of god now people have always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there i am striking at it's the dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people the people think that but there's a mystery of the body of christ that they miss completely because you don't join that you are baptized into that so people could put you out of the company out of their churches out of their circles but they can't put you out of the body brother branham god's people is a call-out people i believe they are in every denomination they could be catholic they could be protestant they could be jewish they could be any kind of church but the real church there we go is the mystical body of jesus christ come on now come on now we getting down into business oh hallelujah upon this rock i will build my church and the kings of hell that's why we are standing because god has given us a rock a revelation oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah peter heard from heaven you may be seated that's the problem right there people hearing from men people hearing what this brother say what that minister say that one on tape say this man another convention say that's hearing men but when you hear from heaven jesus said peter flesh and blood flesh and blood what you heard didn't come from flesh and blood what the reveal was on flesh and blood had not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven let me be seated woman with a bloody issue if she had taken a husband she never went to jesus if she had taken associates her friends or cheap tea party friends mitten and so in friends you should take them on a cake keep making friends if you take them on she was gonna go to jesus because her small church noise rebels rosa set up fishermen prostitutes all kind of characters hanging around this messiah he's talking about my kingdom is another world and you have heard in all times i sent you love your enemies this man has to be half crack and she said if i could just touch the helm of his camera i'll be made whole hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you let me see that that woman was so persuaded of money right now there's a money some of you your money to run out praise god you're stuck up and puff up because you have a tingling in your pocket praise god hallelujah it's ringing some coins knocking inside your pocket and having with some ungodly pride but when that money ran out she knew she had wants to bend down low and get on different to get what she had need of and when you are stripped of your pride strip of your envy and jealousy shipped of who you think you are you are ready for god to minister to you you are ready for something to break up on your life some of you need to break out inside of here some of you to get out of yourself get out of your shell give your god some glory let me see this you cannot organize the mystical body of christ you are a member of that body when you are brought and baptized into this mystical body it's not methodist it's not baptist it's not pentecostal it's not nazarene parolus not catholic but the body of christ we'll pick it up a little deeper he said now watch the body of christ is the church now he likened it in many parables like husband and wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer the bragging was no longer two people they are one she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and then when a man and woman is called to the mystical body of christ by the holy spirit i love how we please these words i'll say it again when a man a woman is called and i trust that this service will give you a burden a hungering to be in that body to be into his church he'd have nice pentecostal church nice message church my all kind of nice churches fine people go there but that's not the real church that's not the church that's gonna raise you have to get into him that body is already judged so you being in him god there's no judgment for you because he already take judgment for you you are free in christ you are delivered in christ oh you are fine in christ the work is finished for you in christ you have a rest in christ christ is your victory he's your salvation he's your joy amen oh hallelujah then they should love him serve him with all your heart now watch he said when a man a woman is called to the mystical body of christ by the holy spirit they become a full member of his body when they are filled with the holy ghost because god took the spirit out of christ raise up his body place it on his throne and send back listen the holy spirit to make up the mystical body of christ which would be united at the marriage supper at the coming of the lord you cannot organize it and here we go it is a mystery so how are you going to organize your mystery holy ghost reigning mystery you're looking at the mystery look to your left right look behind you look at some mysteries around you i caught you i caught you you thought i'm the only mystery here you had a mystery hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the mystery of god coming from god as the word of god and god put your name on the lamb's work of life as a mystery in the blood section oh hallelujah glory so then you know you're predestinated who you follow he called we call it justified even never did it all god asks you is to get cleaned up they don't want to say amen on that one they jump and jump for everything else but to get clean up they want to say amen i'm not going to milk you from no amen you have to get cleaned up god they're coming to clean you up that's baby stuff you have to get diaper diaper wipes you have to lift the baby and clean the baby that's baby's tough bible said when i was a child i walk as a child i talk as a child but when i become a man i put away a childish thing you gonna get your sword out and run them fell inside order your life order your mind out of your home order your family out of your house you got to get out your lazy self stop sitting on the premises and get up and fight get up and do something hallelujah praise god hallelujah somebody had failed inside of here making me feel to preach hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh yes yes yes yes yes hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen oh hallelujah church members they only come in the beginning but you are from the back side of the book don't let the church member mess you up step over them shift from there you are bright church members white throne for them give me eternal life for behavior towards the bride and so on but the bride elect four known the predestinated blood section seven thunders back of the book that's who you are that's who you have to know you are because the devil came in the beginning he is clueless about before the beginning so the mystery that was hid from generations unto generations being made now known to the saints what is the height what is the death what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among you gentiles which is christ in you hope of glory hallelujah sealed into you spoken into you where does husband problem come into this where does his wife probably come into this i don't have a job i don't have a wife i don't have a girlfriend oh better come into this we focus in on what god will is for your life because paul said what can separate me when that vision became the brick upon paul he said what you have to give up anyhow the man with the most money of the leader behind the fanciest car have to leave it behind that pocket book you like so much you got to leave it behind that hairdo you're going to leave behind too that face is saying long to power it up you're going to leave that behind too oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah wrinkle is going come gray

talking about just an understanding now because he talked about the intelligence coming down and i was thinking about the word intelligence intelligence is not knowledge because blackberry had business they had phones that knowledge but they didn't have the intelligence to see how it was unfolding because they was going to do they must research to bring out their phone to give the iphone a run for the money but when steve just finished with them everybody had to be scampering because he brought up something better different that they was not thinking about he was seen ahead by vision that's what vision make you do make it do things others don't think about others how to pick up afterwards it makes you lead others have to follow that's the bride come on say i mean somebody i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you you don't have to ask permission to declare who you are glory to god you don't have to ask for confirmation of who you are the bible said whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by which every joint supplier the effectual working of every part in other words this body will have no schism sit down a minute could you imagine my air having a fight with my nose could you imagine my eye her fight by the tongue i wouldn't want that fight because my body will be in trouble so i want my eyes to be ready ah my eyes feeling like to go in the back where you going you want eyes in the back i don't want you in the back i want you right there i want to see them fellas in front of me come on say i want a seagull i want to see when i take his head

follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me not suddenly not every thursday not when you feel like it no daily god that's your husband that's your lord that's your lover that's your king that's your master he's the alpha he's your manga oh that's the rosenstein that's the little valley that's the bright and morning star that's the fairest of ten thousand oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the one we are living for that's what one we are pressing on to brother branham god great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they don't understand it satan don't understand it none of them the rest of them understands it just those who are predestinated understanded how god and christ are won now watch secondly the manifested christ in you the hope of glory manifested god in christ now christ manifested in you look there's some christians of god reveal what was once god great secret here we go great mysterious secret that some preachers want to make it more mysterious than god himself you know god was so mysterious he he wanted to reveal himself and he come down in simplicity but some men take this mysterious thing and make it more mysterious that they have to break it down and break it down and god lord when a dog you'll say yeah boy you could really break it down break it down break it down break it down the car say table that i see atop four legs unmuted but there's a table but they want to hold the mystery themselves but i said the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the mystery of christ so it's sad to see people having itchiness keeping until deserved teachers when the more of god that you get is the more simple you become you you could talk to the bull you could talk to the bees an intellectual man is a complicated thing they even think about communicating with bull but when you come closer to god and you get the love of god and you connect with the dominion of god that was in genesis 1 26 when cosine let that man of dominion and the bull come say bull i'm a servant of god go back and lie down and that bullet to push breaks mode because that bull coming down that way but that bullet the press breaks to stop in front of the prophet oh hallelujah so simple you may be seated you could talk to a dead fish i said little fishy i'd give you back your life so simple you could talk to a tumor before the doctors and touches my wife tumor dung hallelujah he don't have to be in the hospital room just speak the word speak the word just speak the word because we belong to another kingdom in this kingdom of power and the power comes by the word if we speak it gonna happen because my word shall return forward praise god i'm taking the thoughts of god to speak the word of god oh 420 i believe it is the kingdom of god is not in word but in power but the problem is people sit down in this message so long it come like johnny crew tie to the tree so long now when they call get cut johnnyco is still making circles the other person said johnny let's move he said move away you notice about the elephant let's put the elephant on a stake from small so if i know he can't go far because it's take down until when i get big i still believe it's stick is there so everything is saying i'm going back to the jungle you seen right there nice twist member staying right here do you know a master will be taking on you as the lord leave it yes let him say that he said i'm saying here prophet told me to stay here some stay out there stomp say a jericho stomps there better want to continue to do what they've always done they love it because that's what they're customized never venture never stepped out they're afraid to fail they're afraid that god wouldn't show up that's why they don't want to step out because they don't have faith to believe god will show up because god has made you put yourself on the line god has let your faith go out on the line to see if you're going to believe it oh our god is able to deliver but if he doesn't deliver i am not going to power down i'm going to step out and fade into the fire oh hallelujah gloria come on now feel the rumbling the camp you may be seated so when your neighbor come around and the neighbors say oh god i'm feeling sick say neighbor do you believe that jesus christ seemed yesterday forever say neighbor jesus said these signs shall follow them put the word ahead do you want me to pray for your neighbor my heart have no condemnation and there is no therefore not no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and i believe if i pray for you you'll be healed do you believe it then if two would agree touching anything we could have what reacts come on now somebody help me somebody oh glory to god oh we are in the world now hallelujah called want to baptize you into that body the head showed up in that church the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them he as the head was demonstrating himself among his own people confirming the word with signs one of the miracles it wasn't just a preaching service it wasn't just a teaching service it was a service in which the angel of god was there present to vindicate and to manifest that the world was god hallelujah we have to come right back to that but iran said you know what i'm waiting on oh glory to god what is he doing he's putting himself on the line he doesn't even know the angel would come all of a sudden he said he is here i take every spirit why he's here then if he's here i've got the power to do whatever i want to do whatever i say i'm going to do because he is here and if he's here i'm an ambassador of the throne i mean the throne is here it means the king is here and i belong to a kingdom and the kingdom of power the kingdom of authority come on same as somebody oh hallelujah the kingdom is nothing word only so what was god great mysterious in his mind is now put in the heart of the believer that is the body of christ what was god once great mystery in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest god's great mystery watch has now been unfolded in jesus christ given down to his church what was not once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the girl you're going to marry you love her so much you tell her secrets she get next to you and love you and everything you know it is that's what god christ is doing the church he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these floaters i mean his wife by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of god comes to god's people and paul said in the last days there shall be people heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god truth-breakers false accusers and continent despises of those that are good heady high-minded high in a form of godliness led away by divers lust never able to come to the none of the truth these men resisted janice and jambres was able to produce a church produce a group of people but their folly will be made manifest when jesus take his bride and set her up there this is her their folly shall be made known so there are those who follow you remain known right at the very end my look at having the revelation of this secret made known to them his grace oh blessed be name of the lord and now you can see the end time message why is rejected it's no denomination the revelation of his mystery no denomination look god in his body christ christ in his body the bride god made manifest in christ christ made manifest in the bride and god took from the body of adam the woman and christ main manifest in the bride god took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word bringing a bride that won't fall by the nomination no sir she's coming back with pure unadulterated word of god being manifest i hope every man hears this tape and every woman she is a second eve she is not breaking and swollen skirts of purity and holiness to a husband she will stay with his word listen regardless what anybody says and when the holy spirit told the prophet pick up a pen and write he says no man can make them do otherwise they can't be persuaded otherwise as i told him in africa i'm standing by the world but over you're not with his brother and a brother no no no i'm with the word if anybody with the word we're going to meet because we can only meet in christ paul was 12 years with the word and when he met peter they were saying the same thing paulie called people peter here what this person is i will tell you go and preach that nice paulie new pope hallelujah but no pope and tell paul what to preach paul said by revelation was it made known to me and i want to speak to you about my knowledge of the revelation of this mystery oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god he come by revelation you cast up a man with revelation that's impossible that's the rockies billy's church on oh hallelujah got it people didn't like john you have to love jen oh john come and bring our message he said listen know i am the waymaker i come to cut down mountains i come to cut root then people get i get baptized and normally in the intellectual thank you for coming thank you for coming

churches that are members of the mystical body of christ and every time we see him when the bird sings see him when the sun rise and when it sets hear him in the songs watch him in his people see him vindicate his word oh lord you our god early will be called upon you lord we are at the end time i see the doors will soon be closed the doors of opportunity and while it is daylight i can still get to some of these places lord help me to go i'm getting old give me strength renew my youth lord help me that i might do something out there now that i'm waiting for this great time to come that will be here help me lord as i go out that i might be able under some way to catch that last predestinated seed that will bring back the lord jesus aha the last predestinated seed and ram said maybe the last maybe in africa but when that seed come to redemption the book is closed it's finished then dynamics being in full effect people say i see it it's too late the door is shut the ark is closed rain is falling and you can't get in the ark was the body to be baptized into the message was 120 years come into the ark come into the body come into christ press your way the kingdom is preached and every man pressed their way into it hallelujah barack saw the plagues he said we are striving to get into the kingdom of god before the plague strike the plagues coming on come on strike one day when it strikes everything is set 50 50 still righteous righteous still holy holy still in pennsylvania i asked the brother there for a plumb line a plummet and i held it up to the people a plummet gives a thick footicle the weight connects to gravity you could go crossways and off-key with levels and so on but i plummet perfect every time so the building is leaning the problem exposes it the problem speaks for itself you don't need to say plummet when you think about that no just hang it and it speaks for itself you can't shift the problem and say let's move me left because my building shape left right so so move a little bit so the permit doesn't shift for pastor prophet teacher evangelist apostle nobody he promised god and inside twenty they say righteousness i will lead to the plummet when i heal re when i was then i wash away the refuge of lies the hiding behind lies i'll wash it away hallelujah oh yes truth will always come forward hallelujah not knowledge truth not you shall not have knowledge you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free oh howler the truth brings out the reality of the matter oh hallelujah praise god that plummet that promise is the word i have to line up with it you have to learn about it all man jacqueline put it we don't twist the plummet we change ourselves to deployment probably is a perfect vertical that's what god's going to judge everything by russians i relate to the plummet oh hallelujah i love the word of god word of god is pure word of god is true he is no respecter of persons i have no eyes as you come on now give the lord a shout on that one let's stop making excuses let's believe the word for what it is if god said so god said so for example brother branham said when russia go down to get that oil and i know i always knew the quote so i know when russia next premier i said no something in there checking to find out where is the oil oh in the final oil is in the sea so now that russia take cremia russia gains so much of sea space and in that species they say if creamer was held by ukraine ukraine was going to be oil sufficient because all the oil and you see russia already have it already because russia are next crimea according to the prophet's vision then if that come to pass if google released a coward or sharing that come to pass annihilation will come to pass everything that prophet said will come to pass what about the bride revival now hear the bomb hear the bomb what we see so do what make a church that going to make come on now so you know no man it's like a big revival so you voo you hallelujah going to make the church fairly please oh hallelujah you're going to make a church hallelujah they're going to make a revival you may be seated then you have to get a revelation of being the church you have to get a revelation that you are seed of god could you take some more because i am loaded this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah my my my my man hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise be to jesus oh glory to god notice the vindicated word in his body is the very victory and reason of his death the vindicated word in his body the body is the bride but branham said now watch he said no i'm a member i am this you're not a member of our nice organization i'm a member by the grace and the body of christ i'm your brother i have no selfish motives my motive to achieve anything personally i am only zealous for the lord god and i see this with all my heart the very thing that you were called out of you have gone back into it again as they're so good of wallow and a dog against this vomit the vomit made the dog sick in the first place why if organization and the creator has got the people so bound up and god has quality by free people and you turn right back is a sin to you notice someone sampson had them doing tricks to entertain them that's just about the way it is he says it got instead of the holy spirit and when someone raises up and gets arrogant the holy spirit is obligated to god to shut that thing up oh praise the name of the lord they can't be original if watch he said that's the way the churches can't be let one church get something not in the city the other just can't stand it until they get it they're not original anymore god word is original it's the word it has to bring forth it's kind it's kind in its season how do we get into this church by one spirit we all baptize into one body oh my soul would cry hallelujah to god oh praise god amen when i think that god puts in his church the best that he can find god takes his children and tests them with acid tests then he places them into the body of christ because they are tested come on i expect you to run that one hallelujah that's the plumb line amen i said test he said they believed they went through trials they had the experience they are witnesses of his they know what they're talking about not just intellectual conception but they have been born again of the precious holy spirit and time tested and tried until their soul set like flint towards calvary yes they are time tested they are witnessed on his power oh glory in the last day revelation the seven seals revelation six in the last day revelation we find out loudly said the last messenger during the time of his prophecy the seven seals will be open the seven mysteries the sevenfold mystery will be left off to every age and so forth but we are promised according to revelation 10 malachi 4 that there will come an ephesians to this what does he mean he's going to come to one lord one fate one baptism one body and when you see that body you're going to be part of that body being here in the church is nothing what if the main thing is to be in the body this church here is to get that you could get the word that something will come upon your life that you could get desperate and say lord baptize my soul put me into heavenly places hallelujah let the white light pass through my being leave a portion of yourself in me fill me with your spirit oh glory to god amen so ephesians is not the local church ephesians is the bride body international oh hallelujah the fifo ministry is not just the local church the fifo ministry is for international it's for the bright body the bright body not churches not conventions the bright body all the body of christ oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah amen brother branham almost through here this is quitting real good but about christmas god reveal christ is revealing one word if anybody misinterpret jesus christ in the bible of not being god himself make him the second person he says that this will upset every word in the entire bible it will break the first commandment though shall have no other god but before me he said now watch for jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible and he is made manifest in the age that the part of his body is being made manifest so even though he's a word we have to connect with what part of the body is being manifested because the feet and the legs and the chest is already taken up we come like the neck part and he is the head part and all the rest of the body is underground waiting for the voice of the resurrection even the trump to call them from the dead but i say that the voice of the archangel which is promised to come upon the bride which will bring on the intelligence to bring us to a place where you could see it because you have to see it before you possess it come on say amen somebody you have to see it before you possess it in other words you may be seated they didn't have the full seat all along and you can't bury pot seed saluta had part wesley had part all them fell as that part but a branham came to gather all the parts to present a whole seed which is the word so by the time he come on the scene son of man ready to unveil himself and the son of man is the sword of the seed but the seven areas gonna turn it come from eternity to guard up all this scattered wood all the loose ends and tie it back into the world to bring down the holy ghost but the holy ghost couldn't come out as holy ghost the holy ghost coming as promises and peter said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world to lust so for the escape ones we have these virtues to fight for the contempt for to press for oh hallelujah by one spirit we are baptized into that pyramid body amen oh my god i'm gonna finish missions can't please you don't receive the holy ghost to become seed brother branham because you are seed hallelujah oh my my my mind hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah so listen to this it struck my soul about the body the body of christ people could put
