christ is in our souls if it wasn't for him you know the the christ that that walked this earth he he promised he'd come back again and not just in a physical form but in his spirit manifested in each one of us in our lives you don't have to have a title to have the christ the the life of christ in you to manifest him you know you're just just being a christian like what albert was saying last night i really appreciated that he said i don't have to be a minister to be a christian that's right that meant so much to me because that that is my testimony but i have to be you know you can be anywhere you just live your life and and christ will manifest himself through each one of us and he said you know you don't have to be we've never been this way before we're we're in a brand new season don't be afraid to make a mistake that's what christ's blood is therefore can you make an honest mistake and you repent and you move back that blood is there to cover us we move forward and i really appreciate brother ovid coming up and the uh his messages uh we've been hearing him since uh a little bit august there when he came back from africa and i was telling him on the phone the other day and said i feel like there's a the level of anointing has increased just my personal testimony but we're in a new season we're stepping up it just we're climbing that pyramid coming up into that holy ghost and it won't be us anymore friends i just would like to welcome brother over to the pulpit this morning and having him share what the lord has on his heart with us let's sing that song amazing grace how sweet the sound because it was god's grace it saved a wretch like me like is amazing grace foreign too many dangerous toys that's jesus hallelujah see gross darkness covered in earth we see across darkness cover the people you see nations and kingdoms and kings and presidents they don't know what to do a time of trouble or upon the earth break the sluggishness break the deadness bring the coldness out of us sanctify us lord lord we thank you for the specials oh god that the portable work on us the lord that the alabaster to worship king lamb father bless the singers lord bless the worshippers your father for your long for the people to worship you in spirit and the truth come into your word and speak to our hearts in jesus name you want to go to isaiah chapter 61 isaiah 28 revelation 22. isaac 61 102 28 already from fourteen to twenty two average 61. spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord had anointed me preach good times unto the link yet assembled openhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives was 14. ourselves therefore saith the lord god behold in zion for a foundation of stone a dried stone the precious comes to a sure foundation he that believeth shall be like judgment also rarely and your covenant with death shall be disarmed and your agreement with hell shall not stand shall pass over by day and by night it shall be of excession he shall be wrought as an invalid given that he may do his work his strange work and bring the past his act his strange part now therefore be nothing release your hands remain strong for have heard from the word of god and the spirit and the blessing come that he will hear it see come let him when the things come and whoever will let him take the word of life last night i kind of stumbled into your second message preaching germany last year when you were identifying the ministry of jesus christ quite inspiring and when you made the remark that they have been coming up on my heart lately there's a 5-4 the same if you will stand after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian and act like a christian so this ties in perfectly with what he said make yourself a christian and act like a christian if you will put your faith in god's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your god will let the the brother says this quote takes away complacency and premature self-appointed pleasing making all to keep striving and to behave ourselves i'm just in love hallelujah hallelujah in other words we have not attained we press towards the map hallelujah hallelujah said not that i have a team i pressed towards the mark and the coach he called it was from an adoption time 1983 i think his 12th of november 11th in december uh the lord's messenger was in the lord's message you can't separate it and when that messenger stays in that message that message becomes part of him and what's the bride's message seven living voices when that becomes part of you then the anointing is with you charity is with you and can't know minister paul and i said this yesterday can't no minister put this into you unless it's already anointed in him it can't be there we had 40 years of that we are talking about something different that's right hallelujah we're talking about future power men empowered by god to be channels of communications there is my spirit flowing freely to begin with so what he can't point into you by revelation he's got to point to you by experience it's got to be something that he has silver and gold have i none such as i have i give it unto you then you'll have to take note that that man has been with jesus oh he's not wonderful praise god this is from a message called inheritance preach june 20th now you mean omnipotent speaking yes and the miraculous does confirm it not just taking all the quotes and scriptures and putting them together perfectly more than that it needs here we go the miraculous to confirm or the for it to make it come to pass to vindicate and to confirm it so nobody can get that confirmation i know he's among you not me i don't have to be here for him to move in all right i will say it again i don't have to be here for christ who is oh come i'm not saying coming i'm listening to spirit in the brain subject restoration and judgment and uh oh it's a tough one but god [Music] you have to click the refresh button experience to break and napoleon and effective these promises i couldn't stand here in front of you today i couldn't have the resentment and inspiration vision that here we go these messages are not directed to any certain individual and we wouldn't want people to think that we are sort of clan or a bunch of fanatics that they gather ourselves together to separate ourselves seemingly not having defeat or serving ourselves against anyone or against god or against the church we are for the church but we are only trying to point out by the holy spirit and himself the reason for this segregation that we have today [Music] which that we have all separated out we believe that it should be together as one great united group of the body of jesus christ now that's a different thing now you say body of jesus christ okay waiting for that glory is coming they should not be separated at all and what separates it there is born to be some basic reason that we are not together and in studying it i realized in studying it it's not the colors of our skin because yellow black brown and white all separate in different organizations it's not the kind of food we eat we all eat the same food we wear of the gospel each man and they ought to be some way to definitely show which is right and wrong and the only way you'll ever do it is not to put an interpretation to the word but read it the way it is and believe it that way each man put in his own interpretation makes it see something different and brings it back to the original organization of the catholic church which the catholic church believes that god is in the church and the word has nothing to do with it god is in his church now we may think about jesus but what we have in mexico is the same thing that's right because when you give people the word they don't take the word they say no we believe this but god is the world in the beginning was the word it was with god and the word was god so this is brother branham we protest and we find revelation 17 all of them together that the catholic church was the mother of organizations and we see that the protestant organization blindly has the same nature of the catholic church the bible called the catholic church and called the protestant church and that the was the mother of hearts and that is people that is ill-famed woman who doesn't live true to her my referrals we all claim to be the bride of christ and yet so untrue what would make the untrueness by living here we go not by talking by living contrary to the discipline that god has laid out for his bride to live by that's my own opinion the bible and his informal word of and therefore we find out that the protestant church in order to have an organization separate itself even from the scriptures to make our organization ministers or they will hold to those things and they come do i'll be begging bread in other words he's getting a salary from the church and he can't make a stand because if he'd make a stand he'd get cut off and he'll be begging bread now watch i've got a ministry i've got to get to the lord i've got to get to the people i have no backing up do you realize that christ is our backing up the bible is our backing up then you see the protestant church is exactly the same thing that cognitive is praise the name of the lord oh this is what is happening today praying in the name of the lord but a random testimony will eternal god he's praying what else could we expect of judgment when the mercy is overstep then judgment must come and god i pray that you enjoy your people together with the chords of love and bind your hearts together that soon when gabriel walks to that green baptist my friends in the air he said your church come together and go up to meet him in the air before the great judgment shall blast the earth with the graces of god oh god have mercy he said there are many here tonight have the last opportunity grant lord that they will be saved tonight and filled with thy spirit very simples we need be healed tonight drunk lord and little scream go up lord until tomorrow that i seek to be awakened with great testimonies anoint yourself and then if i fall with you lord i pray you senator portion tonight that i will not i will not be speaking but let the holy spirit speak oh blessed be the name of the lord let's continue from revelation chapter four that garden the tree of life and he's talking about i want you to notice that he said that they are interested in keeping the tree of life he said they kept the tree of life and that's the way of life now i want to show you a link this is an altar business he expressed so jesus was the expression of god so god wanted to reveal himself that was one of his goals were to keep that and grant that to get back there you know always the only way you can get back by the altar it must be covered altar was a judgment seat in eden it was not a mercy seat it was always a judgment scene but the blood on it [Music] on earth is what make it a mercy seat so we only have mercy because there is [Music] and the truth is but if we confess ourselves he is faithful and just to forgive us from our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness [Applause] reveal himself in christ in her bride to take her back to eden let's say it again god so mysterious elohim reveal himself in christ then come to a bride and take her back to eden listen to this the only thing will enter into this gate of eden will be through the blood of jesus christ so to get back to either you have to come to the altar you have to come to the blood there is no other way but the fire oh give the lord some praise people oh hallelujah amen and paul told timothy in 2nd timothy 4 he said preach the word be instant in season out of season rebuke reprove exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure song doctrine but after their own lust shall he unto themselves teachers having eaten ears and they shall turn away their heirs from the truth and shall be turned on the fables but watch them in all things and draw do the work of the evangelists make full proof of your ministry you know if you split when the church gets away from the world it will believe anything amen anything all right this is what we see today now i just want to kind of dig back into listen's message and not even really complete it but i was talking about a goal that you could pursue and we're going to talk about the mechanics all that we could do praise god exodus 3 2 the angel of the lord appeared him in the film of fire out of the midst moses exodus judges the angel appeared to roman manual speaking [Music] god sent an angel unto jesus to destroy and as he was destroyed the lord be held and he repented him of the evil and sent to the angels it is enough stick your hand so when god commissioned an angel there is no such thing as a holy oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me glory matthew 28 2 angel the lord son of heaven came and rolled back the stone and sat upon it luke 28 and they were in the shop country shepherds a buying field keeping watch and an angel and the age of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were so afraid and the angels unto them fear not for behold i bring to you good tidings of great joy isn't that right hallelujah on watch acts 5 17 the high priest rose up on which of the set of the sadducees and the laid hands on the apostles and put them in common prison but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors brought them out angel doesn't come just to come and say the angel is there the angel come to pull you off the prison come people want a man again they want some church again they want some headquarters again they want something to connect to when you're supposed to be connected to the headquarters which is a headshot is the holy oak which is god himself hallelujah go away with god or when herod could have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two shoulders listen to shoulders around peter born with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the age of the lord came upon him and shine right in the prison he smote peter on the side raised him up saying arise quickly and his chains fell off his hands and the angel said unto him great thyself and bind on my standards and so he did and he said cast thy comment about and follow me that's the angel oh hallelujah praise god this is the amplified and when they had passed through the first guard and the second they came to an iron gate which leads into the city of its own accord the gates were moving and they went out and passed on one street and at once the angel left him israel 1947 and when the age of the lord spoke to me last time speaking by the way night before last i see them again in the room for the first time for about six months i'm trying to do something i try to do something do you think the holy ghost wasn't with the prophet i have to put around preacher word he said you know what i'm waiting on [Music] what the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can get started god will do this yesterday praise god amen and god keep his word and when you say to the scriptures and say to you history find out martin luther john wesley calgary knox finney sankey whoever it might be just look at them how they come out from among these things and stood alone upon the convictions god servants and sometimes even your own family you have to stand alone sometimes your mama your partner will disagree with you sometimes auntie and uncle sometimes your large member will disagree with you if it's god's will you're standing on steam if you stand alone on god's word for every man that ever moaned into a hill of beings stood on god's word with a testimony sometimes you have to stand alone mama might not breathe father might not breathe but you have to stand alone somebody in five minutes here message why cry speak and then they ask me do you believe that's the prophet i said yes i believe that the prophet god knew what i was talking about i didn't know i said i believe that's a prophet how something clicked inside i heard it was an evil to evil power at the catholic church hallelujah that's what you're here for when you worship it shows that you he is god is the object of nature hallelujah praise god all right what is the holy ghost there's a vast difference between a christian and a holy ghost filled christian all right now we're going to get this on the scripture and visit exactly the scripture the first place is a christian that professed to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he is only in the process of becoming a christian he's a professor believe it he has woken to it but god has not yet given him this spirit of the holy ghost he has not yet reached that glory with god so you've got to press the kingdom is preached yes the holy ghost is your possession speaking about this woman perseverance blood issue woman she had many hindrances and if you happen to think about it a faint didn't have any she had a promise and she had a determination this was the last chance and mommy ran out and she got to something she began to push and there was a big tall guy standing there she said excuse me amen he said no i don't believe that man preaching i don't care what he's a baptizer he can set you free he is a winner he's the same yesterday forever her faith had no hindrances fate doesn't know him like the cell phone you have a nice cell phone it's nice it's the latest it's big it's broad and everything else but if it's not activated you might as well use them all thank you just like that yeah because that can't call anybody they've got to get it activated get activated if to achieve anything you've got to set a goal that's right all right to open up the eyes of the prayer jesus come the scripture and today the bride will find the scripture to declare the offendings of allah is going to be restoration and judgment that's why it will not the brand they're going to be a call from revelation 2017 a call of blood a call of mercy but flip that over the bride will pick up the avengers the path of jesus your goal is to come in the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man into your measure of the stature of a perfect man brother branham said this is perfection now this is always random talk about perfection from products he couldn't stay there you see once a turn into [Music] they want to speak to him john said there is one standing among you he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and that's what we want in our churches also is [Applause] see woman moving under the power of the holy spirit if something is done wrong they will quickly come and confess it before the spirit got ahold of it amen praise god that's the truth of the world oh my poor heart is getting old i've been wrong i've changed like that perfect works of god without sin oh hallelujah jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that's why the work was done he was the incarnate god do you believe that god the father which is the father of jesus the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in jesus christ which was the tabernacle of god so jesus was god's talent [Music] he is the head of the body who is the church so when he's at church we're talking about a body when we say body we're talking about one spirit we are baptized into the body and he becomes your head not headquarters in this church or some man in your head jesus is your head he becomes your headship he's a headship over the body he's a great magnet to connect with you and then when you become perfect he connects with you and we raise the dead you're going to fall out from the prayer we're going to pull them off from the grave because you are going to become the magnet stay without now listen and the word was invisible listen close the world was invisible until it was made flesh then the word become there he visible forward now truly sacrificial death recovery and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual right all right [Applause] amen coming to the individual and make the world visible i wish my church would get that if you could see it friends the invisible god made visible then we could say sirs we will see jesus so friends do you understand your message amen the invisible god was the word ministry of the words now it's made visible by the ministry of the spirit hallelujah so always god is invisible when it's just worth it but when the music of the spirit which we are moving into you will see that invisible becomes visible which we are not breaking into it oh hallelujah hallelujah what spirit the spirit is upon me not looter not wesley not pentecost but the spirit itself comes upon our brain underground the spirit upon the prayers glory to god in heaven hallelujah [Music] here we go to that perfection of the son of man here we go when husband and wife will be the same self persons right amen but explain what he means by that right after himself persons god will be so manifested into his brain his church they will be the same that's right oh glory hallelujah they are one now you see where we are at praise the name of the lord praise god seven rainbow and always looking for the money position when he says but he was not speaking about jesus yes oh oh in the united states would run around the gift that god has given us that is the holy ghost god's gift and if all the children would break down their barriers when running around the great gift of godly love and the baptism of the holy spirit it would be the greatest defense this nation could have right on all the scientists and atomic bombs they could invent so what god wants us to do all of us all right in our different denomination he'll keep on listening this is the winner yeah there isn't what says and see how much we believe this i'm not talking negative i think but i'm just still working this is what god wants us to do is to recognize one another as brothers and sisters rallying around this great great gift of god which is the holy ghost that comes with power and manifestation and demonstration of his presence right notice he didn't say quotes all right and teachings and mysteries and revelations you're not talking about that he's talking about rallying around the holy ghost that comes with power and manifestation and demonstration of his presence then there would not be one cruel word spoken against any move of god we will all be one in one great bundle of godly love and listen that is what it's going to take for the church to go to rapture so we are not going anywhere i am not going anywhere if i am separated from my resume something got a something got to take place we have got to have a reminder [Applause] and we are going to have a relay [Music] [Applause] heal the sick they are afraid to offer a gift i had great meetings great evangelical citizens and one souls jesus from wonders from those things many will come to me in that day and say lord i'm gonna cast out devils in your name in your name it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than joining church and takes the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls and unite us together as one christian body moving from one objective and one goal it takes the holy not ghost not books not to believe it the way others preach it it takes the holy ghost what did every minister preach this what if every man said break take this spirit and preach it to the tell the congregation it takes the holy land [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't want to be anybody because you have to have faith in what god blessed you all you are this is the way that i am this is my calling this is how i preach i pray for the faith that god does i pray for the messenger i pray for the grace of god and when god made you he's the one of you oh give me the lord you are free this morning you are free to shout you are free to praise the living god oh hallelujah oh glory to god so it takes [Music] one purpose he wanted to achieve the entire bible amen is that right praise the lord and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been entitled expressing what god great goal is and now in the last days he reveals and shows it now you can't make the world contradict itself because in the beginning of the world the world was but when christ here we go he's identified in you identify himself then you are christ's life amen christ identified in you then you are christ's life which the word christian means to be christ-like there is your identification oh praise god not i believe this you are christ's side you see because somebody is christ like and let's say the belief is wrong when somebody show themselves i'm praying for you will give up on us foreign in order for them and the duck's gonna have fellowship [Music] [Music] from is the world because now once there's a word the word becomes a conductor of spirit so elohim thoughts the word the conductor of spirit but the spirit becomes through the world to make it visible oh [Applause] i that was his own inspiration let him lift the seal you are in [Applause] secondly to have the preeminence in a body of believers that it is bright that he could take us back to either to restore the kingdom isn't that right so god is the word is not right away from the prophets the word spoke to israel is not right blessed be [Music] they will live in all righteousness is not right we will live in all the world without even knowing it isn't unrighteous he can take some garment and cause a whole messenger because i will die and that the later on in his ministry he said he was just testing me for when you're going through the pressure on earth character is not a gift character is a victory the cut to come true had to groan i wanted to disappear i wanted to hide i wanted to give up ministry i want to do so many different things to get out of here oh yes but when i look back there's a test oh hallelujah [Applause] if that is what you want me to do i'll do the exact opposite when the devil want me to sit i will stand yeah i need every woman to keep silent hallelujah i am a son of the king oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord so brother branham said this last great step must come to perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church you see what we emphasize in the dynamics spirit we emphasize mechanics too much we have got to emphasize that makes no sense you have to receive the spirit yes [Applause] god is ready if he's not doing it now he's going to call a church perfection by his word jesus christ tie me up i'll never get tired of that don't fool me did you ever tell the lord but you couldn't see the thing you said no you blessed that man look at that kind of look at his family look at the money [Applause] nice you have to say the writing to your wife i know i know i know i know and i shall see you for myself and do this kingdom destroyed this body i'm going to see you there's a pride in pennsylvania and he was a sign of deliverance to israel and a sign of judgment even [Music] the very waters that choked the world drawn the world was the notice jesus he said is the inclinity of vengeance when jesus read the scripture but within that judgment of being right now there is a mercy under revelation 2017 you see if i am not in i can still come in so you can't shake me [Applause] oh you are free this month oh wonderful wonderful israel there we go after 400 years remember what kind of promise to deliver right but here what happened after phone visible and god never reveals himself and shows himself until his people is ready to receive what he shows it is so it shakes you off from being complacent it shakes you from being lazy it shakes you from being just you know accepting god said it will come to pass no no no no no you're going to press reveal oh praise the name of the lord god will never meet with man unless but under the blood when you turn the blood down then your meeting place where god has been taken away god first decision in the garden of eden that man will only worship him under the shadow of sacrifice and that's the only place that god will meet man then and that's the only place god ever meets with man and the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice you see i don't care if you're messing this baptist presbyterian if you can forget your differences roman catholic whatever you might be i will come under the shed blood glory meet with both of us that is where we can all meet and fellowship on receiving grounds but otherwise he will not meet you because you are a methodist he will not meet you because you're pentecostal he will meet you under one condition how many believe that did you believe that in this message when you believe with them or you join their organization or join their group or join their church is as if god has been privatized because he's going everywhere and the blood is always with him and therefore he can only see you through a chapter your white is snow when you confess your sins otherwise you're not then you can't fellowship that's the reason you don't see things happen in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the plan to get to the blood of the word and there is only one we go with one of that word you will never say sound you can't do that the only way you can do is under the messages of god oh praise it right now from the indictment thee who is that the truth that they they found fought with the man who was the word is that right they fought forth with the man who was the world no defined for with the word working through the man now this is his ministry and god is working through him and people have rejected it and he will bring an indictment to each other stands across the world or abandons his word jesus lawyer has brought a indictment this is not me being elected okay so watch it for all of us so you say watch he said watch they fall forward the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through the man which is the person the holy spirit will get through is called vindication here there it is today it strikes maybe some little man when it went off had a call of god he felt he went to some seminarians and creed he must live by that creed or give up his fellowship he is blackmart nobody else would have him because once he belonged to something else no he don't belong to it they figure there is something wrong with that man they will not have him in the congregation and when the congregation's only looking for one side here it is then the congregation only came on one side that is if he believes what they believe that's the only way he accepted him not if he's a minister like one time when iran went to a service and they heard oh it's not something else you say what they're doing today they're trying to push by the spirit they call for revival everywhere holy revival when the world itself can't go through the people how are you gonna build a platform here that they crucify him that jesus christ was the person man god here we go he was the manifestation of god he was god in body form to reflect the word for that age to make that ac growth for me for that age and the holy ghost today is the same thing it's the spirit of god upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself do you understand what this means amen it's the spirit of god to come upon you that's right therefore this written word must become you then the spirit come upon you the pride is not the spirit it's the spirit and the brand is the word and the spirit comes upon the brag oh it's do you see it now jesus was the example son jesus said the spirit is upon me he had anointed me the bride will do the same thing therefore the spirit will drop on the brain and she will say the spirit is upon me [Music] i can know it is okay 4. he would raise up to turn the house of return back to the pentecostal fathers now i condemn you guilty and challenge you and indict you before god with wicked selfish nomination you have crucified the word of god before the people i call you guilty ready for judgment i call the same thing that peter did he called for repentance of that generation i call repentance to this generation repentance towards god come back to the original truth of the word come back to the faith of the fathers come back to the holy ghost because god cannot change it my god and if i can stand and sit trying to challenge my precious minister and brother to come back to the holy ghost come back to the principles that we fought for for 40 years lived [Applause] you're trying to do the answer first five-fold preach mystery fighter reveal mystery so the more gracefully you really get your fight
