[1:02:05] you with us in fellowship this morning
[1:02:08] amen so if you have your Bible the
[1:02:11] lights go straight to the word just one
[1:02:14] portion of Scripture this morning
[1:02:17] reading from the book of Revelation
[1:02:21] chapter 10 and just reading verse 7
[1:02:28] revelation 10 and verse 7 just one
[1:02:32] scripture reading
[1:02:39] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:02:42] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:02:45] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:02:48] finished as he had declared to his
[1:02:50] servants the prophets my lord and a
[1:02:53] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:02:55] may be seated this morning amen
[1:02:59] we'd also like to welcome Samuel James
[1:03:02] and Cheryl James invited by brother
[1:03:04] Alexis welcome to the head Sun
[1:03:06] Tabernacle this morning and also
[1:03:08] Kristiana arendelle in right away
[1:03:10] brother George Mahone welcome to the
[1:03:12] headstone tab on this morning we're
[1:03:15] happy to have you with us so I have a
[1:03:18] title this morning the unfolding of the
[1:03:22] mystery of God the unfolding of the
[1:03:26] mystery of God because it is a mystery
[1:03:30] it has to be unfolded because a mystery
[1:03:33] unless it isn't full it will remain a
[1:03:36] mystery but God cannot unfold it all at
[1:03:40] once so it takes time to unfold it but
[1:03:43] before I touch the text this morning I
[1:03:45] want to remind the church that brother
[1:03:47] Branham said in every church there are
[1:03:49] three kinds of believers he said they
[1:03:51] are unbelievers he said they are make
[1:03:54] believers and they are true believers
[1:03:56] this is just the encourage of fear this
[1:03:58] morning in a message the Queen of Sheba
[1:04:00] brother Branham said now some people
[1:04:02] look at their symptoms my pastor prayed
[1:04:07] for me last night but my hand is no
[1:04:09] better but everyone said that has
[1:04:11] nothing to do with it
[1:04:13] if you are really a believer then you
[1:04:16] don't even look at that it's already
[1:04:18] settled forever God healed you what if
[1:04:21] Abraham would have looked that next
[1:04:23] month to see if Sarah was going to have
[1:04:25] the baby he never noticed that he just
[1:04:28] noticed what God said and any true
[1:04:32] believer looks to the promise not what
[1:04:35] the symptoms are around them they look
[1:04:37] at what God said and that's an
[1:04:40] encouragement to you this morning
[1:04:41] because if you want to find sometimes
[1:04:44] you'll find symptoms but they're random
[1:04:46] said when you come to church if you want
[1:04:47] to find problems you'll find problems
[1:04:50] but if you're looking for Jesus you'll
[1:04:52] find Jesus so I'm not here this morning
[1:04:55] to accentuate the problems and the
[1:04:57] symptoms and the troubles and we can
[1:05:00] spend a whole service talking about how
[1:05:02] rough things are and how much pressure
[1:05:04] we had this week and what didn't work
[1:05:07] out and what you who are disappointed
[1:05:09] you and what expectations you had that
[1:05:12] didn't seem to work out because when all
[1:05:14] service talking about nobody knows that
[1:05:17] trouble I see them and maybe there are
[1:05:20] times we could spend time talking about
[1:05:22] it but this morning I want to focus on
[1:05:24] the promise this morning I want to focus
[1:05:27] on what God said this morning I want to
[1:05:30] be a true believer I want to forget the
[1:05:33] symptoms I want to forget the past I
[1:05:37] want to forget what went wrong I want to
[1:05:40] forget what happened yesterday I want to
[1:05:42] forget what you disappointed with I
[1:05:45] wanna forget about it this morning and I
[1:05:48] wanna look power power ever blackwood
[1:05:51] never he has brought us too far to leave
[1:05:54] us the problems you'll always have the
[1:05:57] problems but I have seen this morning
[1:05:59] that greater is He that's in you than he
[1:06:02] that's in the world it's time to put the
[1:06:05] problems of and the symptoms and the
[1:06:08] doctors reports and what your neighbor
[1:06:10] said and and what it doesn't matter this
[1:06:13] morning Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah
[1:06:19] and I'm also this morning I'm not
[1:06:21] preaching to everybody
[1:06:24] Oh hallelujah but the Branham said and
[1:06:28] the father said the gospel will be
[1:06:29] preached and then the end will come
[1:06:32] but the preaching of the gospel is
[1:06:34] really to the true believers will always
[1:06:37] have made believers will always have
[1:06:40] under leave us but in every age there
[1:06:43] always be a true believer somewhere and
[1:06:46] the true believers they are minority or
[1:06:49] they are few but for the Planum said in
[1:06:52] every age they were true believers and I
[1:06:55] believe in this day in 2018 they are
[1:06:59] still true believers they are still
[1:07:02] believers who will stand on the promise
[1:07:04] of God they are still true believers of
[1:07:06] who will hold on for their families hold
[1:07:11] on for their loved ones hold on for
[1:07:13] their children hold on for their
[1:07:15] husbands hold on for their wives
[1:07:18] hold on for the church there tarry until
[1:07:21] this heap our deal tarry until every
[1:07:25] word comes to pass up deal hold on
[1:07:28] you're not gonna give up you're not
[1:07:30] gonna see and nothing is happening
[1:07:31] they're gonna hold on to the promise of
[1:07:34] God until the promise is manifested
[1:07:37] until the promise is real
[1:07:41] Oh hallelujah Oh all true prophets in
[1:07:51] the message my kinda prophet all true
[1:07:54] prophets all true Christians all true
[1:07:58] believers stay with that word no matter
[1:08:01] what anybody says you stay right with
[1:08:04] the world when they see the days of
[1:08:06] miracles has passed don't you believe it
[1:08:09] for the Bible said he's a see me
[1:08:11] yesterday today and forever that's why I
[1:08:14] say all the time I'm tired of church up
[1:08:16] because church has become a formal
[1:08:18] ritual I have to get up on Sunday
[1:08:21] morning but that's not what I came for
[1:08:23] this morning I didn't come to have
[1:08:25] another service I came to see this Bible
[1:08:29] come alive I can't see this message
[1:08:31] because I'm a true believer and I will
[1:08:34] wholly go to the world not one of these
[1:08:36] days this mortal will put on immortality
[1:08:39] that one of these days the headstone
[1:08:42] will unite with the body one of these
[1:08:45] days your son your daughter he could be
[1:08:48] in the bar they could be a prostitute
[1:08:50] but a word will find them and the word
[1:08:53] is better than any police officer the
[1:08:56] world will arrest them
[1:08:57] the world will lock them up the Word of
[1:09:00] God will bring them to the house of God
[1:09:03] deal come whether they want to or not
[1:09:05] because once the word of God goes forth
[1:09:08] that what cannot return for
[1:09:12] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:09:16] oh brother Clarence good kind of even
[1:09:19] take back his word if you wants to the
[1:09:22] moment it's spoken it's like an owl it
[1:09:25] cannot come back up and every time God
[1:09:28] shoots up he never misses the target
[1:09:31] whenever God shoots up into take time if
[1:09:35] you take a season but it's gonna hit the
[1:09:38] target and God has shot from glory a
[1:09:42] promise of revival yes shot from glory a
[1:09:46] promise of restoration he has shot from
[1:09:49] glory a promise of deliverance and no
[1:09:54] devil could stop it no demon could stop
[1:09:57] it your makeup can't stop it your pants
[1:10:00] where it can't stop it you're cutting
[1:10:02] your hair can't stop it because all of
[1:10:04] that is in the flesh but yes blood
[1:10:08] yes not for the seed in your soul I'm
[1:10:10] not looking at the symptoms I'm looking
[1:10:13] at the circumstance all hell is supposed
[1:10:16] to be against you what all heaven is
[1:10:19] with us just smaller
[1:10:24] oh we serve notice to that demon of
[1:10:28] sickness we serve notice that that demon
[1:10:32] of cancer we serve notice to that demon
[1:10:35] of female condition we serve notice our
[1:10:38] eternity Manasa we serve notice to your
[1:10:42] posture we serve notice to condemnation
[1:10:45] we serve notice to ungodly spirits we
[1:10:50] serve notice to every foul spirit we
[1:10:54] serve notice to every holder that the
[1:10:57] enemy wants to have in your house up in
[1:10:59] your life yes
[1:11:01] power in the blood yes power in the name
[1:11:04] of Jesus to break every chain to break
[1:11:07] every shackle
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:13] halleluyah halleluyah time up double
[1:11:17] time up double Oh hallelujah Oh glory
[1:11:22] glory glory you may be seated for a
[1:11:26] minute when Jesus I love to preach about
[1:11:29] this because it broke the routine it
[1:11:32] brought the expectation when Jesus said
[1:11:36] let us go to the other side
[1:11:39] I love preaching about it because it was
[1:11:43] the other side it was not decided it was
[1:11:46] expected that Jesus would be on it was
[1:11:51] the other side it was not where the Jews
[1:11:59] congregated because the Jews didn't
[1:12:02] congregate where the pigs will what are
[1:12:04] the other side is where the pigs were
[1:12:06] when the prodigal son left his father's
[1:12:09] house to go to far away he was the
[1:12:12] living among his people because his
[1:12:15] people didn't have pigs among them so
[1:12:18] Jesus had to go and find that man where
[1:12:20] he was he had to find a prodigal where
[1:12:23] he was Jesus himself said he that I well
[1:12:27] have no need of a physician we didn't
[1:12:30] come this morning because we are all
[1:12:31] right we came this morning because we
[1:12:34] need help I don't know about you but I
[1:12:37] need help I need Jesus today more than
[1:12:40] yesterday somebody helped me this
[1:12:43] morning I need strength to breathe I
[1:12:46] need strength of walk and he's trying to
[1:12:48] preach and in strength of worship I wish
[1:12:51] I had more energy I wish I had more of a
[1:12:54] voice up because when John saw dilemma
[1:12:57] he said all in heaven
[1:12:59] or near to all an idiot because the lamb
[1:13:04] was don't worry I wish I had a voice of
[1:13:07] some this morning
[1:13:09] because I want to shout I wanna sing I
[1:13:12] wanna worship
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:18] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:13:21] oh I'm not trying to work nobody up
[1:13:24] that's not what we're about this morning
[1:13:27] but when something changes in your soul
[1:13:29] we just trying to wake up the sea that's
[1:13:32] inside of you that's what we tryna to
[1:13:34] wake up the seed that's already inside
[1:13:37] of you because if there's no seed you
[1:13:39] could never see this thing let me say
[1:13:43] that again if there's no seed you don't
[1:13:45] stand a chance but if there's a seed
[1:13:48] even if you're backslidden you're coming
[1:13:50] because the seed must bring forth after
[1:13:54] its time the seed has got to produce you
[1:13:59] may be seated
[1:14:00] Oh hallelujah
[1:14:04] and God knows about how the law of
[1:14:08] reproduction works so when you want to
[1:14:10] plant the seed it can you put manure but
[1:14:14] stuff on it and all this stuff in your
[1:14:17] life when the devil thought he was
[1:14:19] destroying you it was only cleaning an
[1:14:21] environment for God to work through the
[1:14:24] cedar because he will share his glory
[1:14:26] with nobody he will share his honor with
[1:14:30] nobody
[1:14:31] he is the one to bring you into a
[1:14:33] manifestation he is the one to call you
[1:14:36] from the world call you from your family
[1:14:39] call you from your situation call you
[1:14:42] from your chest
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:48] you may be seated
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:55] hallelujah so I don't know what the
[1:14:58] mission he came in here with but
[1:14:59] something happens when God is here no
[1:15:05] matter what type of entity it is when
[1:15:08] God is here there's a response when
[1:15:15] Jesus crossed to the other side
[1:15:17] the man didn't know who Jesus was but
[1:15:20] the spirits that were upon him knew
[1:15:24] immediately because the Bible says he
[1:15:30] ran and worship he ran that man didn't
[1:15:36] know who Jesus was but those spirits
[1:15:38] recognize that the maker of the wind and
[1:15:41] maker of the sea and the one who made
[1:15:45] the sixteen elements together to make
[1:15:47] man had dropped down the sim thority
[1:15:51] that created the Sun the same authority
[1:15:57] and one of these days this mystery of
[1:15:59] God will be unfolded because you are not
[1:16:03] even what people see
[1:16:09] when people look at you they see
[1:16:11] burnished in and they see by the mic and
[1:16:13] they see better Alexis and the devil
[1:16:16] wants to keep it that way
[1:16:19] even Moses when people when people saw
[1:16:22] Moses he say Moses but the Bible said
[1:16:25] that Moses refused to be called the son
[1:16:29] of Pharaoh's daughter the moment he
[1:16:31] realized that he was not what they were
[1:16:33] calling him for all of his life they
[1:16:35] were calling him Pharaohs that's the son
[1:16:37] of Pharaoh's daughter that's Allah
[1:16:39] that's a son as Moses a son but when he
[1:16:41] got a revelation there passed and he
[1:16:43] refused to be called the son of
[1:16:47] Pharaoh's daughter don't call me that
[1:16:50] don't put that name on me don't tell me
[1:16:54] I'm not gonna make it no no no no don't
[1:16:57] tell me I'm gonna miss the rapture don't

[1:17:12] was but now that I know who I am
[1:17:15] I refuse to be called the son of
[1:17:18] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:17:19] I reject my past because my past on this
[1:17:25] earth is not a real me I come from God

[1:19:47] he may be seated I'm gonna get to the
[1:19:52] text another manager but anybody knows
[1:19:55] who knows me I love to talk about the
[1:19:57] Navy SEALs it just amazes me because
[1:20:01] Navy SEALs part of the US Navy and at
[1:20:04] any point in time they're on average 1
[1:20:06] million sailors in the u.s. Navy and on
[1:20:11] average they're about 300 Navy SEALs 300
[1:20:15] out of 1 million as part of the training
[1:20:19] but a popular to become a Navy SEAL
[1:20:22] there's a bell that hangs in the middle
[1:20:26] of the training ground and they tell you
[1:20:28] don't stress yourself out if you don't
[1:20:31] have what it takes go ring the bell and
[1:20:35] if you ring the bell it's no problem you
[1:20:36] could go home we're not forcing nobody
[1:20:39] to be a Navy SEAL but if you clap what
[1:20:42] it takes you gotta be able to survive
[1:20:45] you're not able to fight if you are the
[1:20:48] only man left you got a complete the
[1:20:50] mission because you are the best of the
[1:20:52] best
[1:20:53] there's no other soldier like you but if
[1:20:56] you can't take it going the bell and
[1:20:58] many times when the Navy sees tell their
[1:21:01] stories he was anywhere on the edge of
[1:21:04] they almost couldn't make it and the
[1:21:07] instructors would tell him don't worry
[1:21:08] ring the bell
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:13] we will laugh at you ring the bell giver
[1:21:17] but those who make it that given up can
[1:21:21] stick giving up is not in our vocabulary
[1:21:25] backslide and listen the problem is not
[1:21:33] backsliding on the problem areas theorem
[1:21:36] and they don't get back up but these
[1:21:38] guys you have to go on the water yes sir

[1:23:36] the 11 mosquito and spider I'm big
[1:23:43] butterfly when I see you lying there
[1:23:46] like lord have mercy I was any better
[1:23:49] I never sequel i waver faint but every
[1:23:52] trial every test is to bring out the
[1:23:55] attribute in you that caught but there
[1:23:58] you didn't put it there is your
[1:24:01] responsibility is to keep the atmosphere
[1:24:06] some the very appearance of evil be in
[1:24:10] the word so that you would know to
[1:24:12] recognize the devil at every one of his
[1:24:14] tricks because he's not gonna come to
[1:24:16] you that you will see devil come in
[1:24:18] devil come and ever come in he don't
[1:24:22] give out of advance warning look at me
[1:24:24] I'm a devil I want to talk to you you
[1:24:26] would run it's you and fall for that but
[1:24:31] he has to finally had to use your friend
[1:24:34] use your beretta use your school friend
[1:24:38] use the teacher and you could use
[1:24:40] anybody at all never could use anybody
[1:24:44] here's fine his way and if you don't
[1:24:48] recognize it
[1:24:49] look at Jesus Matthew fix 16 pizza can
[1:24:52] revelation to her Christ and after that
[1:24:55] Jesus had to open the revelation to them
[1:24:57] this is what's gonna happen is what's
[1:24:58] gonna happen
[1:24:59] Peter I said no no it's not true see
[1:25:01] fide Jesus a boy with no I don't know
[1:25:03] how to break it to Peter and the off you
[1:25:06] would on this one Jessie just get behind
[1:25:08] me Satan
[1:25:11] know plenty people can have a lesson
[1:25:13] because how do you think bit of you five
[1:25:16] minutes for mighty testimony
[1:25:18] five minutes later glutes Academy hi
[1:25:20] miss Eton
[1:25:21] so if you take a recognize he still
[1:25:23] missing something
[1:25:24] despite the revelation where the random
[1:25:27] said a supernatural element
[1:25:29] she still remained that's the prophets
[1:25:32] world so despite the fact that Peter had
[1:25:35] a revelation of the Christ he was
[1:25:36] missing a supernatural experience to
[1:25:40] teach him something deeper than the
[1:25:42] revelation he had something that would
[1:25:45] sustain him how many I would carry him
[1:25:47] something that he could share with other
[1:25:49] people something he could demonstrate
[1:25:55] he's not what you want it's not what
[1:25:58] you're looking for
[1:26:00] hallelujah this gospel is real friends
[1:26:04] you say there's gonna talk a little bit
[1:26:06] before I start about to preach I was I
[1:26:08] was speaking I was speaking on Tuesday
[1:26:12] night and they go Martin I was speaking
[1:26:14] about Noah and you know I said the
[1:26:18] mystery of God is so fast that if every
[1:26:21] word is to be written we would never be
[1:26:23] able in our human life to read it it's
[1:26:26] too much so God had to choose what he
[1:26:30] wrote so by faith Noah that's it by fate
[1:26:36] and within those few words speaks up and
[1:26:38] sums up Noah's whole life so I was
[1:26:41] preaching about getting into the act of
[1:26:43] safety but the man said Christ is the
[1:26:45] Ark of safety but I was bringing it
[1:26:48] because I love to see the God's will
[1:26:50] become real to people because a lot of
[1:26:52] people come to church they come to
[1:26:54] service and they're disconnected they
[1:26:57] hear intellectually but they haven't
[1:27:00] identified with it so even the process
[1:27:03] of the lamb and the sacrifice was for
[1:27:04] the believer to identify with the
[1:27:07] sacrifice he couldn't be detached from
[1:27:09] it because he would not be remorseful
[1:27:11] and repentant because it was just
[1:27:13] another lamb being sacrificed it became
[1:27:15] casual because they couldn't identify
[1:27:16] with him
[1:27:18] so I was speaking about Noah and I moved
[1:27:21] from Noah to Noah's family because I
[1:27:25] said listen God spoke to Noah he didn't
[1:27:28] talk to know why he didn't talk to
[1:27:30] Noah's sons he didn't talk to Noah's
[1:27:32] daughter-in-laws and I asked the
[1:27:36] question I said imagine I am sure Noah
[1:27:39] had family relatives people who went to
[1:27:43] school it people who would have known
[1:27:44] him next on me but even if he didn't
[1:27:46] talk to them he know them I said Noah's
[1:27:49] wife would have known people Noah's sons
[1:27:51] would have known people know as
[1:27:53] daughters-in-law would have known people
[1:27:55] and not one of them was able to convince
[1:27:58] anybody to get into the ark for all the
[1:28:12] years I've no appreciate
[1:28:22] because nobody acted on it
[1:28:27] I'm sure Noah did all he could do to
[1:28:31] tell people this thing was coming
[1:28:34] because but the Branham said for you to
[1:28:37] be concerned you must be convinced
[1:28:41] convinced and concern that's how he
[1:28:43] preached it so I'm challenging my spirit
[1:28:48] because I'm asking myself have me done
[1:28:50] enough for our families for our friends
[1:28:56] because when the class boom went out in
[1:28:58] the days of Exodus in the days of Moses
[1:29:00] it was a loan for a house and the Bible
[1:29:04] said if your house was too small team up
[1:29:06] with somebody else but in other words
[1:29:08] make sure you get into a house where it
[1:29:10] was blood the gospel has never change
[1:29:15] the message has never changed it has
[1:29:17] always been to get into the safety get
[1:29:23] into the ark get out of Solomon get away
[1:29:26] from it get into the hub's with the
[1:29:29] blood how convinced are you because when
[1:29:38] you are convinced your life begins to
[1:29:41] reflect it your walk begins to reflect
[1:29:44] it your talk begins to reflect it it's
[1:29:48] not to have knowledge but the brother
[1:29:50] said there was no difference between the
[1:29:53] Egyptians and the Jews except that the
[1:29:56] Jews were given a way out they were
[1:30:01] given a way of escape if an Egyptian had
[1:30:04] done the same thing he would have had
[1:30:06] the same result because cause would is
[1:30:08] consistent it wasn't only because it's
[1:30:10] you if you do this no that's why if the
[1:30:14] Jew did not do it he was dead because a
[1:30:17] death angel wasn't asking what tribe you
[1:30:19] are in who told you about it was not it
[1:30:26] and all of this is the mystery of God
[1:30:30] that was unfolding because was a type of
[1:30:33] the perfect lamb that would come and
[1:30:35] that blood would be applied on our lives
[1:30:38] as a life that people must see
[1:30:41] until said in the last days I poured my
[1:30:44] spirit upon all flesh and he goes and
[1:30:46] then he said my people shall never be
[1:30:48] ashamed never be ashamed and I shared
[1:30:54] with them on Tuesday that never be a
[1:30:56] shame as a powerful thing because too
[1:30:59] many of us were ashamed because I said
[1:31:07] to display the blood on your house it
[1:31:11] was a public display most of us who want
[1:31:14] to live a private Christian life we
[1:31:17] don't want nobody to know we don't wanna
[1:31:20] buy to ask us any questions we want to
[1:31:22] be secret Christians and when God's
[1:31:26] requirement is that when the world looks
[1:31:28] at you they must know that there's blood
[1:31:33] so I gave the believers in big amounts
[1:31:36] in homework two weeks ago if your
[1:31:39] neighbors don't know you're Christian
[1:31:41] there's something wrong if your
[1:31:45] coworkers can't tell you a Christian
[1:31:48] there is something wrong if your family
[1:31:52] cannot tell you are Christian there is
[1:31:54] something wrong I don't care how much
[1:31:55] books you read I don't care how long
[1:31:57] you're on your knees if there's no
[1:31:59] display of a life that could persuade
[1:32:01] somebody that your pen with Jesus you
[1:32:04] need to go back the father is all
[1:32:09] that's the kind of preaching people
[1:32:11] don't like to hear because we would like
[1:32:15] to be comfortable but the reality is
[1:32:20] this they took note that they had been
[1:32:22] with Jesus the inspiration of this
[1:32:28] convention we have coming up is apply
[1:32:30] the token because by the branham's of
[1:32:33] the evening time message is supplied a
[1:32:35] token and the token must be on display
[1:32:38] you can talk about display until you've
[1:32:41] applied it and you have to apply it a
[1:32:43] certain way well well I want to put the
[1:32:47] blood on the back of my house I don't
[1:32:51] want nobody see but tell our tele angel
[1:32:54] check the back I didn't find it was much
[1:33:00] in with my colors my house is white
[1:33:02] white enough that's irrelevant but over
[1:33:13] preach the message last week about the
[1:33:15] ceiling angel and a seal of God it's a
[1:33:20] painful thought friends to think you
[1:33:22] want to make it and you don't make it
[1:33:24] because you took something for granted I
[1:33:28] have a burden this morning the burden is
[1:33:32] not to preach the book is a sigh and cry
[1:33:36] until there's a change in your soul I'll
[1:33:41] tell it'll change with how I speak to
[1:33:43] their husbands change with her husband
[1:33:46] speak to their why as a cheat with how
[1:33:48] children speaks to your pair you can
[1:33:50] tell me there's blood on your house and
[1:33:53] you're disrespecting your parents that's
[1:33:54] not what the blood is supposed to
[1:33:56] produce the Holy Ghost life must be a
[1:34:00] Christian everyday in every situation in
[1:34:04] everywhere there are no exceptions
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:14] it is either we want the reality or we
[1:34:17] want a kind of a gospel and the brother
[1:34:22] said judgment begins in my sanctuary in
[1:34:25] the house of God he's not judging
[1:34:27] outside it begins at the ancient men who
[1:34:33] know better - ah - establish the prayer
[1:34:37] altar in the house even if the whole
[1:34:41] family don't want to come to the altar
[1:34:43] you are there having a testimony that
[1:34:46] the altar has been re-established in the
[1:34:49] house no excuses no excuses even if you
[1:34:59] don't know the prayer long still kneel
[1:35:00] there as a testimony Lord I wanted
[1:35:04] establish I don't have to burn any yet
[1:35:07] but I'm doing a sign of I'm doing
[1:35:09] something because we cannot go on the
[1:35:12] way we have been going
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] knowing all the mysteries knowing all
[1:35:29] the quotes knowing having all the books
[1:35:31] and the tips and your life can't even
[1:35:34] match up to a pentecostal who just loved
[1:35:36] the Lord and God hasn't opened their
[1:35:38] eyes of this truth but you don't mess
[1:35:41] with their prayer you can't mess with
[1:35:43] the in sanctification you can't mess
[1:35:46] with what they understand they're a
[1:35:47] hundred percent and God by His wisdom
[1:35:53] didn't show them this and this and what
[1:35:56] they know God will treat to them
[1:35:58] according to what he revealed to them
[1:36:00] but you are brought a higher calling
[1:36:03] because in the days of the voice of the
[1:36:06] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:36:08] sound the mystery is finished and his
[1:36:11] expectations of us are higher
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:23] Oh somebody help me this morning bring
[1:36:27] back the altar bring back to reality I
[1:36:31] don't know where I'm gonna get it but
[1:36:34] I'm depending on him this morning I
[1:36:35] don't even know I'm gonna go back to the
[1:36:37] notes but as chorus I'm feeling himself
[1:36:41] when Jesus came he said in vain do they
[1:36:44] worship Ritchie was teaching the
[1:36:52] commandments as if this is anything and
[1:36:59] it sounds crazy
[1:37:00] Noah's message became boring enough
[1:37:04] everybody knew was Noah's preaching
[1:37:06] before he pissed at the bridge for you
[1:37:11] to even come and sit there every Sunday
[1:37:12] if you were coming you know you're
[1:37:14] coming here DC message because your
[1:37:17] messages is gonna rain and with the
[1:37:20] banner plays such an importance on the
[1:37:22] message a token we could spend time
[1:37:26] talking about the vials and the plagues
[1:37:28] on the walls and it's it's all there but
[1:37:30] where the Bremen said their seeds for
[1:37:32] the bride what good is it - no but the
[1:37:35] plagues and the fires on the wars if
[1:37:38] you're not gonna make the rapture what
[1:37:43] good is it to know all of this if the
[1:37:46] whole purpose of the message of the hour
[1:37:48] is to turn the hearts of the children
[1:37:51] back to the faith of the father and we
[1:37:53] miss that
[1:37:55] because we are so busy with the cares of
[1:37:58] life we are so busy with our cell phones
[1:38:01] we are so busy with the news we are so
[1:38:04] busy with social gatherings we are so
[1:38:06] busy with staying up-to-date on the
[1:38:09] politics and government and the wars and
[1:38:17] when there's no cry there's no sign but
[1:38:22] I said why can you preach was to shout
[1:38:24] and jump what good is it the shout and
[1:38:26] jump if there's no crying even so come
[1:38:29] Lord Jesus
[1:38:30] there's no desperation in your soul
[1:38:33] there's no you have becoming used to
[1:38:36] living tano how much minutes did you
[1:38:46] pray this morning did you even pray if
[1:38:50] you pray yesterday did you pray today
[1:38:52] before how do you grow as a christian
[1:38:56] radio by when i'm praying every day
[1:38:59] there's no debt amidst other tears you
[1:39:01] miss attendance that is a Miss Britton
[1:39:03] and I've read in sadena try it now
[1:39:10] and as this flesh depends on oxygen your
[1:39:15] soul depends on the Word of God your
[1:39:20] soul depends on the relationship with
[1:39:22] God you looking for a break you in your
[1:39:25] house you look at if I break you in your
[1:39:27] life you're looking for a break you in
[1:39:29] your marriage you looking for break you
[1:39:30] on your job I'm gonna say and seek me
[1:39:33] first and everything else will fall in
[1:39:35] place
[1:39:36] that's real gospel
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:40] [Applause]
[1:39:43] you know what people miss God will make
[1:39:46] all your efforts feel deliberately he
[1:39:52] will crumple your business if it takes
[1:39:56] you away from him he will destroy it
[1:39:59] again and again and again and again
[1:40:04] until you realize that it's not your
[1:40:07] efforts and he is the one to provide if
[1:40:10] you put him first he will open doors you
[1:40:13] never fought it open that's how much
[1:40:22] he's interested in your soul because
[1:40:24] this flesh has a time limit on it but
[1:40:26] your soul is eternal so he will put this
[1:40:30] flesh into whatever it has to do that's
[1:40:33] why that's why the promise that if love
[1:40:34] doesn't get you desperate then
[1:40:36] conditions will we need to be more
[1:40:43] sincere we need to be desperate I asked
[1:40:49] the question all the time if God were to
[1:40:51] come right now to grant the desires of
[1:40:53] your heart
[1:40:54] what is that desire it's going to come
[1:41:00] to Grand the desire of your heart
[1:41:02] what is that desire when since the
[1:41:05] haughty right was speaking to the
[1:41:06] Prophet the Prophet was testifying of
[1:41:09] the experience he had I believe it was
[1:41:11] with the squirrels and when Cincinnati
[1:41:16] right said that's nothing but the truth
[1:41:18] the angel of the Lord was so pleased and
[1:41:22] he said whatever you asked for you could
[1:41:25] not get it the Prophet said if you act
[1:41:29] some money you get it and she said then
[1:41:37] say I want the salvation of my two boys
[1:41:43] do we have Christians like that I want
[1:41:51] the deliverance of my soul I want my
[1:41:53] family to be under the blue that one
[1:41:56] I want two revival in my children that's
[1:42:02] more important than anything else if you
[1:42:13] don't have the Holy Ghost friends you
[1:42:18] should be so desperate so desperate
[1:42:23] above all else let everything else fall
[1:42:26] apart because you need the token but if
[1:42:33] I said we are lost without it we are
[1:42:36] gone without it all the church calling
[1:42:40] is in vain if you don't get the equal
[1:42:42] sign though I know all mysteries do I
[1:42:49] speak with tongues do I give my body to
[1:42:50] be burning and it equals that if I don't
[1:42:53] have charity I am nothing all of this is
[1:42:58] to bring an equal sign some time ago I
[1:43:02] said I want to preach a message called
[1:43:03] the equal sign because we add up
[1:43:07] everything in life and we hope that the
[1:43:09] equal sign it will echo something good
[1:43:13] we hope it will equal good good score in
[1:43:16] life well lord I do distance what I do
[1:43:18] that when the Bible says people come and
[1:43:21] say but lord I did this in your name and
[1:43:22] you say well depart from me you worker
[1:43:24] of iniquity because all of it left an
[1:43:27] equal sign where you still living like a
[1:43:29] rascal still living like a devil still
[1:43:32] disrespecting your husband your wife
[1:43:34] your children the house of God live in
[1:43:40] any how you want and want to come to
[1:43:41] church because pretend the season
[1:43:45] changes and people didn't realize there
[1:43:47] was no longer pizza but angel had sat on
[1:43:51] his throne and the pillar of
[1:43:53] was there so because the new pizza and
[1:43:56] everybody knew everybody he said you
[1:43:58] haven't lied to me a lie to you holy
[1:44:00] goes it's out of my hands and Friends
[1:44:07] every day that passes we're getting
[1:44:09] closer to the rapture so we ought to
[1:44:13] walk more carefully now than yesterday
[1:44:16] we ought to be more desperate now than
[1:44:19] yesterday we ought to be more sincere
[1:44:21] than yesterday even the Prophet core
[1:44:25] told him you have to be more sincere
[1:44:26] what about us
[1:44:27] oh lord help us can the church say man
[1:44:31] so can I strike my text a little bit
[1:44:40] remember it over it said he really wants
[1:44:42] us to have a time of prayer time I
[1:44:45] crying out I turn my sign he said if you
[1:44:50] don't make the time we'll make the time
[1:44:52] here in the house of God because the
[1:44:56] Prophet said we could sing too much we
[1:44:59] could preach too much we could dance too
[1:45:01] much but we can never pray too much just
[1:45:08] to remind you church Matthew 24:40 then
[1:45:13] shall two be in the field and one shall
[1:45:15] be taken and the other left two women
[1:45:19] shall be grinding at the mill the one
[1:45:21] shall be taken and the other left I want
[1:45:24] you to recognize what this scripture it
[1:45:27] is not as if they were two in the
[1:45:29] physical church this is a type of normal
[1:45:31] living as in you're going about your
[1:45:33] life but then the hour comes that you
[1:45:35] didn't expect it what's there for for
[1:45:39] you know not what hour your Lord that
[1:45:41] come the Bible makes it very clear but
[1:45:45] notice that if the Goodman of the house
[1:45:47] had known and what watch the thief would
[1:45:50] come he would have watched I would not
[1:45:52] have suffered his house to be broken up
[1:45:55] therefore be also ready for in such an
[1:45:58] hour as you think not the Son of man
[1:46:00] cometh
[1:46:02] a reality check friends are you ready if
[1:46:13] the rapture were the take place is
[1:46:14] evening are you ready
[1:46:28] so God had a purpose and a hidden
[1:46:30] mystery and that's what we're speaking
[1:46:32] about this morning that's the prophets
[1:46:34] words the hidden mystery of God that he
[1:46:36] had in his mind before the world ever
[1:46:38] began and how that it's unfolded itself
[1:46:41] right down to this present hour that we
[1:46:44] are living in then you will understand
[1:46:46] clearly then I believe what is being
[1:46:49] done and I've spoken on this many times
[1:46:51] how scientists are trying to figure out
[1:46:54] and the world's gonna figure out and how
[1:46:57] this God if God has read of God it's not
[1:46:59] real and this and this and and God over
[1:47:01] time because he was too big he was too
[1:47:04] powerful because he couldn't be captured
[1:47:06] in any way he had to unfold himself over
[1:47:08] time he didn't want to be complicated he
[1:47:12] wanted to be accessible he wanted to be
[1:47:15] accessed he didn't want to be
[1:47:16] misunderstood he didn't want that you
[1:47:18] have to have a degree to talk to him he
[1:47:21] didn't wanted you have to go through
[1:47:22] somebody to get to him so he had a
[1:47:25] mission to bring himself to the people
[1:47:28] that they can relate to him personally
[1:47:30] and individually he could do it in
[1:47:33] Genesis or or in the early part of
[1:47:35] scripture so it's a time for him to
[1:47:37] unfold himself that he gonna fellowship
[1:47:40] with individuals the same way he have
[1:47:43] fellowship with Adam in the cool of the
[1:47:46] evening and when Adam fell he
[1:47:48] disconnected that relationship with God
[1:47:51] I knew that every evening God would come
[1:47:56] to fellowship with him I didn't have to
[1:47:59] worry about his condition because the
[1:48:01] Bible said he was naked not ashamed he
[1:48:05] had nothing to hide he had nothing to
[1:48:08] defend he didn't have to prepare because
[1:48:10] God was coming in the cool of the
[1:48:12] evening to talk with him he didn't have
[1:48:13] to get psyched up and let me get ready
[1:48:15] because he's coming because sin was not
[1:48:19] in a picture he was in a condition that
[1:48:21] he could commune with God but the moment
[1:48:26] sins chapter the picture and I'm
[1:48:28] recognized that he was not in a
[1:48:30] condition for God to see him that way
[1:48:33] so he went into hiding until God see
[1:48:36] Adam where are you
[1:48:39] not his physical location because God
[1:48:42] knows his physical location he said why
[1:48:45] are you not in the position I left you
[1:48:47] in a position of power a position of
[1:48:51] authority a position where you were not
[1:48:53] ashamed now you didn't have to hide from
[1:48:55] me you didn't have to hide in the church
[1:48:57] you didn't have to sit there wondering
[1:48:59] what was going on because you were
[1:49:01] covered by the word you were protected
[1:49:05] by the word you were living something
[1:49:07] but all of a sudden you have ventured
[1:49:09] where I told you not to go and now
[1:49:11] you're feeling ashamed and now you're
[1:49:14] hiding what sure is all unfolding of the
[1:49:18] mysteries when Peter undernea Pentecost
[1:49:22] said this is that which was spoken by
[1:49:25] the Prophet Joel where my people will
[1:49:29] never be ashamed and I'll poured my
[1:49:31] spirit the Holy Ghost comes to remove
[1:49:35] that shim to remove your floors and your
[1:49:39] mistakes and not to cover it up prints
[1:49:41] but through the blood it dissolves your
[1:49:45] sins your mistakes your pass and
[1:49:46] restores you to a spiritual being with
[1:49:50] eternal life that the devil can't even
[1:49:53] touch you because the scene in your soul
[1:49:56] is activated by the Spirit of God and
[1:50:00] that's why the great mystery could be
[1:50:03] Christ in you the hope of glory and
[1:50:07] that's what the devil wants to stop by
[1:50:09] sending all kinds of situations your way
[1:50:12] can the church see me hallelujah so the
[1:50:17] attributes of God that he had himself
[1:50:20] that he demonstrated through the ages
[1:50:23] those same attributes are to be
[1:50:26] demonstrated by his children in this day
[1:50:30] because he says that in this time you
[1:50:33] won't have to lay hands and see in Jesus
[1:50:35] name but his name will be in you so you
[1:50:38] could command another bility to command
[1:50:41] the devil is just like your father or
[1:50:44] just like your husband however you wanna
[1:50:46] put it it's the same thing because you
[1:50:48] are him and he is you the same works
[1:50:51] that I do you shall do also because you
[1:50:54] are united with him can the church
[1:50:56] Shaymin and that's cause desire to see
[1:51:00] your life reflect feet virtue knowledge
[1:51:04] temperance patience godly bills not
[1:51:08] animosity jealousy envy your flex in the
[1:51:11] morning you don't want to pray you're
[1:51:13] tired you know Lord let these virtues
[1:51:19] live in me
[1:51:20] it's my prayer live or die sake or drone
[1:51:24] if I can't in my family let me maintain
[1:51:27] Christ Oh hallelujah hallelujah whoo and
[1:51:35] we are counting down friends you are the
[1:51:37] mystery of God you are the mystery that
[1:51:40] caught held secrets in the back part of
[1:51:43] his mind when Daniel and Abraham all
[1:51:46] wondered how this will come to a great
[1:51:48] end how this will come to a final climax
[1:51:50] could imagine they all wondered how this
[1:51:53] will work itself out and God kept this
[1:51:56] secret mystery locked up through all the
[1:51:59] ages how this thing will come to a
[1:52:03] climax how the headstone will unite with
[1:52:06] the body what people will be the people
[1:52:09] who would have the voice of God in these
[1:52:11] last days to think we are that people
[1:52:18] hallelujah you are mystery to your
[1:52:21] family I'm taking my time I'm not done
[1:52:24] yet I'm taking my time people watch
[1:52:26] movies for our two hours you do all kind
[1:52:28] of nonsense we're gonna take time this
[1:52:31] morning because we have a rapture to go
[1:52:33] to so buckle your seatbelts strap on get
[1:52:37] ready because we are gonna give the
[1:52:40] devil a knockout punch don't let the

[1:52:48] give me your soul because that's what
[1:52:51] God is gonna pull this motor will have
[1:52:53] to change to immortality but we shall be
[1:53:00] changed
[1:53:01] Christ was a mystery in his day and you
[1:53:04] are a mystery that's why young people
[1:53:07] you could never enjoy the world because
[1:53:10] there's too much of God in you you could
[1:53:16] never enjoy it
[1:53:17] we could try we could never fit in
[1:53:20] because there's too much of God in you
[1:53:26] so take it out your mind what you wanna
[1:53:29] do who you want to be friends with what
[1:53:32] you want to achieve get rid of it it's
[1:53:34] never going to happen
[1:53:36] God is not gonna allow it to happen
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:43] you may be seated look at Jonah caught
[1:53:47] that you are now closer than ever you
[1:53:49] know it this is a young people service
[1:53:51] you know Gordon never no see I'm Johnny
[1:53:54] I'm not going
[1:53:55] see if I'm good do what you want all
[1:53:57] right young people do what you want do
[1:54:01] not born in next week he hadn't straight
[1:54:03] down to what every party effect whatever
[1:54:05] the correct they life whatever he taught
[1:54:08] was gonna take him away from where God
[1:54:11] tell him to go because Jonah thought he
[1:54:16] had some kind of control he thought he
[1:54:19] could have decided his destiny surely
[1:54:22] didn't realize his purpose had already
[1:54:24] been written Jorah didn't realize if his
[1:54:29] life story had already been written and
[1:54:33] listen what Jordan realized is that part
[1:54:36] was also written
[1:54:39] Oh Jonah would spend some time trying to
[1:54:42] find himself Oh Jonah will come to an
[1:54:47] existential crisis of who he was in
[1:54:50] Gordon and Hojo no attorneys black and
[1:54:53] all of that is written because he is the
[1:54:56] author and the finisher is he allowed it
[1:54:58] to be written and that's how we can
[1:55:00] predestinate based on what is going to
[1:55:03] happen somebody give her a shout of
[1:55:07] praise
[1:55:09] [Applause]
[1:55:15] so Jonah take the ship - it attaches how
[1:55:20] many of us have our own touches oh yeah
[1:55:26] I am Anita - it's not because I have to
[1:55:27] go to tosha's and they've all got a
[1:55:29] different definition of time today I can
[1:55:34] make this I can make this prayer meeting
[1:55:35] because after what the transition they
[1:55:38] can't testify but a good is a look I'd
[1:55:40] have to go to Tarshish they're doing
[1:55:42] good presentation in school when I can't
[1:55:43] tell anybody jesus loves you and Jonah
[1:55:49] get a nice boat a nice room any boats
[1:55:54] resting comfortably any boats until God
[1:55:58] say well here's what I already know hole
[1:56:00] is holding plain old SATA shake the boat
[1:56:02] we know I love about Jonah and that's
[1:56:04] what God loves about you when they said
[1:56:06] to go wrong do they say no one knew who
[1:56:08] it is boy I don't know I wonder I wonder
[1:56:12] why it is happening I wonder I wonder
[1:56:14] why it is happening
[1:56:15] Jonah get off his bed when she the man
[1:56:17] say fellas here's what I'm the problem
[1:56:21] throw me overboard Rapunzel you done
[1:56:24] know any problem throw me overboard and
[1:56:27] Jonah didn't even know that his subtle
[1:56:31] resistance was all part of God's plan
[1:56:34] because those people in the never had a
[1:56:36] respect for some fish good so when Jonah
[1:56:40] pull up in a fish limousine 10 people
[1:56:46] say well this this had to be God and
[1:56:50] Jonah could preach a message repent and
[1:56:53] the whole nation change so young people
[1:56:58] God could have chosen anybody for this D
[1:57:00] but he picked you
[1:57:03] not to be a practice EPO just a casual
[1:57:07] onlooker this is not a easy one looking
[1:57:09] this is the ears for action four sons of
[1:57:13] God to give the devil a final knockout
[1:57:16] punch so all of your training all of

[1:58:47] hope of glory shining force that gives
[1:58:49] you the Holy Spirit and when these
[1:58:52] things take place time shall be no more

[1:59:09] what you are tonight
[1:59:10] there wouldn't be a feeble person in
[1:59:12] here in the next five minutes
[1:59:15] whoo let's get in such an atmosphere
[1:59:17] friends in the beginning and ending of
[1:59:21] the Gentile dispensation but the band
[1:59:22] said what is it the mystery of God God
[1:59:25] in you the hope of glory shining forth
[1:59:28] the baptism of the Holy Spirit then he
[1:59:32] said when these take place time shall be
[1:59:34] no more
[1:59:35] they'd have no their courts settle in
[1:59:38] the last days many shall run to and fro
[1:59:40] knowledge shall increase but didn't know
[1:59:42] their God shall do exploits in the last
[1:59:45] days he shall do exploits see we come
[1:59:49] out of eternity we was before there was
[1:59:51] a world we have said this but I said
[1:59:53] having the prophets age did you know
[1:59:55] that God made man in his own image where
[1:59:57] was you he said to German job thought he
[2:00:00] had some wisdom where was you when I
[2:00:02] laid a foundation on the world before I
[2:00:05] laid it when the sons of God sang
[2:00:06] together and the morning star shouted
[2:00:09] for joy so when you go to school friends
[2:00:14] that's part of the mystery on your job
[2:00:16] that's part of the mystery you have to
[2:00:18] live something and you are not even a
[2:00:21] believer the Prophet said the word in
[2:00:24] you that's the believer so you didn't
[2:00:26] come to church this morning because you
[2:00:28] you felt comments as we're over would
[2:00:30] say but you came this morning because
[2:00:32] the scene in your soul was looking for
[2:00:35] something looking for reality looking
[2:00:38] for an experience looking for a change
[2:00:41] that mystery in you of who you are is
[2:00:44] trying to express itself
[2:00:48] pull on the same way didn't know who
[2:00:51] Jesus was it's the same way you don't
[2:00:53] know who you are Jesus is going to
[2:00:56] church normal normal until they called
[2:01:00] Jesus to read he thought it was just
[2:01:02] another service he thought I was just
[2:01:04] another reader this it was just another
[2:01:06] scripture until Jesus said this day the
[2:01:08] scripture is fulfilled and then you
[2:01:11] realize something was different and one
[2:01:13] of these days you will come to church
[2:01:15] and the scripture will go forth and with
[2:01:18] a Branham said one day the right words
[2:01:20] will be spoken and we could dash into
[2:01:24] the presence of God love what trucktown
[2:01:28] maybe one of these days friends maybe
[2:01:31] today that the Wrightwood would be
[2:01:33] spoken
[2:01:34] then we conceived this day this
[2:01:36] scripture is fulfilled oh this day it's
[2:01:40] a manifestation Oh hallelujah
[2:01:46] could you imagine brother Clarence Jesus
[2:01:48] in church because the Bible said as was
[2:01:50] his custom so he was in a temple all the
[2:01:52] time people shaking Jesus hand people
[2:01:55] saying god bless you afterwards the
[2:01:57] Jesus Jesus going home Jesus walking
[2:01:59] around and nobody know who he is he's
[2:02:02] just like everybody else but in the
[2:02:04] season change and the same prophet
[2:02:07] effort was just another brother was not
[2:02:10] just a different brother this was the
[2:02:11] Messiah himself
[2:02:13] how could Almighty God come under cover
[2:02:16] slip into the tabernacle and eat bread
[2:02:19] with them I didn't even realize who it
[2:02:21] was but when the season changed the
[2:02:24] season changer and when your season
[2:02:26] change friends you can never go back the
[2:02:28] way you were before when you break free
[2:02:31] when you break out when God delivers you
[2:02:34] you can never go back to where you were
[2:02:36] before
[2:02:40] hallelujah brother branham preach he
[2:02:44] said when our chicken is about to break
[2:02:45] on the egg you cannot help it
[2:02:47] he said if you help it you kill it but
[2:02:49] when that chicken breaks out you try to
[2:02:51] put it back in the sugar
[2:02:52] you try to put it back on it could never
[2:02:55] go back and the devil is trying to keep
[2:02:58] you in this shell the shell of no
[2:03:00] worship this shell of no praying this
[2:03:02] shell of no praises his cello if you're
[2:03:05] not gonna make it and you're doing if
[2:03:07] you're gonna make it but when you break
[2:03:09] out you can never go back
[2:03:12] you are persuaded fully persuaded I'm
[2:03:15] going to the rapture I'm gonna be healed
[2:03:18] I'm gonna manifest seven living voices
[2:03:22] nor devil nor demon nor tiredness no
[2:03:25] sickness no black pain no acquaintance
[2:03:28] could stop you because you are broken
[2:03:31] free you are broken loose and who the
[2:03:34] Son of man set free is free indeed
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:42] she made me see that hallelujah that's
[2:03:47] why you have to be so careful because
[2:03:50] how the brother next to you or the
[2:03:51] sister next to you is now it's not how
[2:03:55] they'll be when their season changes you
[2:03:59] don't know who sitting down next to you
[2:04:01] different thing altogether right on it
[2:04:04] might look ordinary but let the spirit
[2:04:06] take a hold of them oh forget it it's a
[2:04:08] different person you could be sitting
[2:04:10] down next on apostle right now you could
[2:04:12] be sitting down it's a preacher you
[2:04:15] could be sitting down next to somebody

[2:04:24] and Peters shadow PETA's mama never told
[2:04:29] him people would be healing your shadow

[2:05:05] brand of reason what is the Holy Ghost
[2:05:08] given for is it gives you power to pray
[2:05:11] power to speak power the level holy life
[2:05:16] that's not mental that's not you making

[2:07:05] somebody help me respond Oh hallelujah
[2:07:12] listen even the Prophet didn't even know
[2:07:17] what he was going to live out because
[2:07:21] God only shows things in part until the
[2:07:24] time comes to reveal it in its fullness
[2:07:29] [Applause]
[2:07:32] you've ever seen it so when the fish was
[2:07:38] dead
[2:07:39] it wasn't the prophets idea to speak to
[2:07:42] the fish the Lord told him speak and all
[2:07:48] of a sudden he realized he could have
[2:07:50] done something he didn't know he could
[2:07:52] have done before
[2:07:53] oh come on church so I want to tell you
[2:07:59] this morning there's stuff in your life
[2:08:00] that you don't even know you have right
[2:08:03] there you're struggling and you're
[2:08:04] struggling and you're struggling and you
[2:08:06] know if you don't know how you don't
[2:08:08] know when you don't know why but that's
[2:08:10] trust in you that the devil cannot stop
[2:08:13] but one of these days the Holy Ghost
[2:08:15] itself not a bus but the Holy Ghost
[2:08:20] itself
[2:08:28] oh we want to break free this morning
[2:08:33] you want to break free this morning
[2:08:35] freedom time Liberty time because the
[2:08:40] Prophet said when you get to know you
[2:08:41] are
[2:08:42] you'd be an invincible army unstoppable
[2:08:46] cannot be defeated Devils run from you
[2:08:51] [Applause]
[2:09:05] hallelujah
[2:09:07] you may be seated you see radiation and
[2:09:13] certain types of bombs and stuff they
[2:09:16] give off a certain signal that you could
[2:09:18] use cameras to see that's all if you go
[2:09:20] to the airport but something is gonna
[2:09:22] pick it up but as a bomb is about to
[2:09:24] explode as radiation gets more intense
[2:09:26] they get brighter and brighter and
[2:09:27] brighter so you know it's about to
[2:09:29] happen
[2:09:29] but Jesus before the spirit with gesture
[2:09:36] would when he waited in the wilderness
[2:09:38] The Devil's arena picked up a signal
[2:09:42] that warranted a question if they'll be
[2:09:46] because it Ares to brightness yet for me
[2:09:50] to know for sure but if thou be then do
[2:09:53] this now because I'm familiar with these
[2:09:57] signs because Moses and even and fls was
[2:10:00] showing signs but and I look up all of
[2:10:03] them but I do I want to look you up
[2:10:04] early and Jesus Jesus to play with what
[2:10:09] he'd ever ask you to do something go do
[2:10:10] it they talk about well the devil asked
[2:10:15] me to pray sir what what devil actually
[2:10:18] to Jesus a man channela by bread alone
[2:10:22] and and he the devil ball in devil and
[2:10:25] she's just part 4 6 it is written never
[2:10:31] try again he's written double trying it
[2:10:37] is also written
[2:10:39] and with a random city devil left for
[2:10:41] seasonings yes I think our less let's
[2:10:49] take a break you see that was come come
[2:10:51] back down and say listen fellas I've
[2:10:52] gone on a vacation do know what that is
[2:10:59] never met a man like this before he not
[2:11:03] trying to impress somebody nothing to
[2:11:06] look at that you would desire him he
[2:11:09] just different I offered him power
[2:11:12] because it filled offer I was if you're
[2:11:15] borrowing to me I give it a whirl at him
[2:11:16] he's he first honey devil make that make
[2:11:18] that offer to anybody he said know who
[2:11:20] this man is
[2:11:21] but it's mine refused you whole world
[2:11:24] but he didn't understand that this man
[2:11:27] came to claim the whole world he didn't
[2:11:31] come to get it ever permission for the
[2:11:32] world he came to clean me that his own
[2:11:38] what the devil didn't understand is when
[2:11:41] it noah's d because the devil is not
[2:11:43] privy to this mystery so when Noah came
[2:11:49] it was water all of Noah's experiences
[2:11:52] must bring this type of water to wash
[2:11:55] the it it's only afterwards no one could
[2:11:59] look back and say boy wait a minute
[2:12:01] all them trials and testings was just me
[2:12:03] being used B instrumentally time for for
[2:12:07] you to be baptized what Oh glory if I
[2:12:09] don't even known but it was a mystery
[2:12:12] being unfolded and it never didn't
[2:12:16] understand the mystery of even Jesus
[2:12:19] because if he caught it right there that
[2:12:21] blood was about to fall blood for man
[2:12:29] blood for redemption blood for
[2:12:32] restoration not for power blood for
[2:12:35] salvation blood for deliverance if the
[2:12:38] devil understood that when he lived and
[2:12:41] continues he made sure no blood put them
[2:12:44] in the incubator but wrap him up in
[2:12:45] something catch every droplet one drop
[2:12:48] for
[2:12:52] but God is a strategist he knows how to
[2:12:55] do things he knows when to do things he
[2:12:59] knows what to do in your life to make
[2:13:01] sure you get the Holy Ghost
[2:13:02] Oh glory
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:18] friends if your whole life is revealed
[2:13:22] to you in advance there'll be no mystery
[2:13:29] listen Abraham go to the ring you you
[2:13:32] won't have a son oh just make sure this
[2:13:33] sticks you can have a son in court to
[2:13:35] Libra Abraham in 25 years
[2:13:37] no you know you were if God had told me
[2:13:42] about him in 25 years you're gonna have
[2:13:44] discern what you wanna do don't do Toma
[2:13:56] Abraham's first respond maybe Lord 25
[2:14:00] years in no no two years oh no it's not
[2:14:08] you yeah this is no no listen when God
[2:14:12] told Abraham another son Abraham's
[2:14:14] expectation was nine months later it
[2:14:19] Remora little time against him and Sarah
[2:14:23] what God waited on but god unfolding a
[2:14:29] mystery and you know what the Bible says
[2:14:34] abraham staggered not at the promise so
[2:14:40] Iran and Ola and I thought if he stopped
[2:14:45] evey stagger physically and but is he
[2:14:47] promised don't mess with Abraham and not
[2:14:52] promise his resolve Abadi promised in
[2:14:56] year one was as strong and as in here 24
[2:15:00] because by a year 24 Iran said well this
[2:15:03] thing had to be closer
[2:15:05] this one has to be would you wait
[2:15:10] [Applause]
[2:15:13] so you can imagine when the Sun comes
[2:15:16] and Abraham rejoicing in this and when
[2:15:18] God's a tender offer be son you could
[2:15:21] imagine Abram would feel but I love and
[2:15:26] somebody as I say yesterday and it's
[2:15:28] really true and that I sing it to my own
[2:15:30] self the certain was I want to stop
[2:15:32] singing because we here let the weak say
[2:15:35] I am strong let somebody see yesterday
[2:15:37] I'm so tired and I say I need to stop
[2:15:42] seen it because the Bible says to
[2:15:47] community that are not as though they
[2:15:48] were let the weak say I am strong
[2:15:50] because when you see a time you are
[2:15:52] solidifying it at is you know even Gary
[2:15:53] Tanner's an opportunity to to be
[2:15:55] resolved because you know I am this
[2:15:58] becomes that that I am is powerful that
[2:16:01] I am construct is what God told Moses to
[2:16:04] tell people who he was so how you finish
[2:16:08] that sentence is very important
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:16] how are you doing I didn't want to say
[2:16:20] it I am sick oh you could finish that
[2:16:22] sentence when Moses the different of God
[2:16:27] I say who shall I see sent me is it tell
[2:16:30] them I am I am that I am finish that
[2:16:34] sentence I am whatever you need I am
[2:16:36] healing so when people ask you how
[2:16:38] you're going I'm getting stronger I am
[2:16:42] getting better I am going to make it I'm
[2:16:45] gonna be here don't tell me you're sick
[2:16:48] you defeated your tire
[2:16:53] let the weak say I am
[2:16:57] [Applause]
[2:17:07] and you watch your life let the poor say
[2:17:10] I am we say I'm poor I'm poor I'm Eunice
[2:17:14] anointing is anointed and I'm just I'm

[2:17:22] your Chinese already if you know how
[2:17:24] sick your over bah bah bah mean when I
[2:17:36] tell it's not normal and Chinese there's
[2:17:38] no normal
[2:17:39] different what what spirit in what I
[2:17:44] have it been a new anointing this thing
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:53] when you said the change will you talk
[2:17:56] the devil said that that's what
[2:17:57] confusing devil because the sacrifice of
[2:18:06] praise is when you go oppositional this
[2:18:08] sacrifice means it is not normal for you
[2:18:10] to give this phrase it's not expecting
[2:18:14] that you give this phrase but the praise
[2:18:15] itself becomes a sacrifice because it
[2:18:19] goes against what is expected
[2:18:22] so I may not have money but I praise him
[2:18:25] anyhow my buddy I have to be careful Oh

[2:25:23] of the printer to this day and at that
[2:25:24] time the mystery of God to be finished

[2:25:31] people don't know the mystery of God why

[2:25:56] the Holy Ghost listen to the Prophet

[2:26:07] expectation that's my hope that's my
[2:26:11] promise God in this last days does the
[2:26:16] Prophet is going to draw true hearts
[2:26:19] from everywhere no matter how much
[2:26:21] counterfeit and Schaaf the devil has God
[2:26:24] will rise his church right out of it
[2:26:27] it'll be a ceiling for sure as I'm
[2:26:30] standing on this platform and the hour
[2:26:32] is at hand the coal and the formal is
[2:26:35] weaning away the Evangelic on and the
[2:26:38] social gospel and all these other things
[2:26:40] are born the fantastic side is going in
[2:26:44] such a radical fanaticism till anybody
[2:26:46] blank and see it but God is pulling his
[2:26:49] church out Lord I want to be pulled out
[2:26:54] the Prophet cause unlike the great
[2:26:56] waterlily
[2:26:57] the little tiny seed born way down in
[2:27:01] the bottom of a mire II mucky dirty
[2:27:05] frogs come upon and it winds its way up
[2:27:08] through the darkness through all the mud
[2:27:11] and all this scum and becomes the finest
[2:27:13] thing that you ever looked into the face
[2:27:16] of with a radiance like the sunshine so
[2:27:19] is the Church of the Living God that's
[2:27:21] being born down in the muder fanaticism
[2:27:24] and chaos but she's wound her way should
[2:27:28] a crime until she's on top of the thing
[2:27:31] just waited for her wings for the flight
[2:27:34] many shall run to and fro and the people
[2:27:38] that know their God shall to exploit set
[2:27:42] still little flock positionally stay
[2:27:45] where you are
[2:27:46] that's what's hauling back the coming of
[2:27:48] Christ now and the great millennium is
[2:27:51] this great supernatural power that
[2:27:55] really is dormant in the church
[2:27:58] the Prophet said is here he said after
