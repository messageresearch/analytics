let's give the Lord a shout of praise tonight Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name amen amen amen thank you Jesus what a mighty God we serve what a blessing it is to be here tonight I know something good is about to happen and something great is in store amen amen amen thank you Jesus hallu at this time I just want to switch over so the word portion of the service amen you love him tonight amen thank you Jesus and just a a little thought I have to share tonight and I know I know that it'll be a blessing amen so if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn with me to a very familiar scripture from The Book of Matthew reading chapter 19 vers 16- 22 we'll read for now when you get it say amen and this speaks of the what we funly call the Rich Young Ruler amen and reading from verse 16 it says and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou wil enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shallal love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions let's just bow our heads and pray once more oh Heavenly Father Lord we thank you once again when we pause at this time lord as we've read your word Lord I pray that you would breath life into it Lord that you'll open our understanding Lord that that you will speak lip to air to your people tonight Lord I pray that you would take me out of the way and have your perfect will tonight in Jesus name amen you may have your seats you know and I read that portion of the scripture and and hope hopefully we would continue in a little bit reading some more but for a title I want to speak on the main thing right the main thing that's it just the main thing we don't want to deal with too much sides shows and go around in circles we want to talk about the main thing want to address the main thing amen can you for a second just imagine if somebody says you know I want to I want to bake a a bread I'm not much of a baker but if been bacon bread and they say you know what I have the Oren the Oren is preheated to whatever temperature the preheat ovens and they have everything laid out there you know the bowls the I don't know water salt baking powder probably yeast um whatever else you put in bread and they have it there and they say well I going to make bread if you were to see that you should either warn them run away or be horrified because they're missing the main thing the main thing is flour right so in the absence of that you're not make bread you're saying you're making bread but what you're saying not really lining up with your actions and what you want to actually achieve and accomplish amen so we want to focus like that so we don't want to end up like like like like that scenario in which we are trying to say we doing something or trying to do some something and we miss the mark because we missed the main thing you know I I could recall when Jesus was in the temple speaking and Mary and Joseph went away for 3 days and 3 days later they realize they left the main thing back they left him right where he was 3 days before speaking to the the elders and and the Learned men and they had forgotten the main thing at that time and we don't want to be like that you know and in another context I want to ask you know if you had the opportunity to work to work hard you really had to to sacrifice time effort energy resources to work hard to attain say say pay some money you you you earned it through hard work and you saved it up to buy something that was of significance or meaningful to you how you think you'll approach the store when you're going to buy it you think you'll just go and just pick up one and walk out and say you know what I save for this and I'm go on you think the way you'll approach it no you think you'll be careful and you will watch it and you'll sit down and you'll Ponder and say you know I deserve this you know because I work hard for it and this is what I want I don't want that one with the scratch you know I want this one because it's seal and look perfect I want the one that looks like what I believe I save towards and what I work towards and that's the way that God is he wanted a bride to be perfect amen he wanted it so bad that he paid a price with his only begotten son so after paying this price which was significant his only son you think he want a halfway bride you think he want any old bride no you see you're looking for a particular type of bride not any kind of bride you know he wants this bride that he chose before the foundation of the world to be perfect to be just the way he expected and to do so what he did he gives some guidelines he gives some instructions he gives some requirements he gives some you know these attributes that he looking for you know if you don't know what you're looking for you'll never find it so he give these things and he say you know if you could match up to this this is what is perfection to me amen not what not anybody else says or your opinion or what you feel this is what he has outlined as as to what he's looking for amen so going through the scripture I went and I discovered and I know you know it it's nothing new it's nothing I created or invented but I was looking at if God wants a bride in this hour in this age in this evil age in the end time what he looking for and you know he left the attributes for us plain and simple that we could read you don't have to find it but in second Peter 1 vers 5-7 you know what he says he say add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so he really want those virtues to be in his bride Hallelujah he want those virtues to live in his bride because when he looks at that that's the image he's looking for that's the image he's coming for he's not coming for talk that's the main thing when all is said and done that is the main thing that you add that so if you're missing Hallelujah you're missing the faith The Virtue the knowledge Temperance patience godliness broadly kind you're missing those things you're missing the main thing but listen he went further in 1 Corinthians 13 Hallelujah from verses 1 to 10 here's what he say he describ his bride in this way he said listen though his bride speak with the tongues of men and angels if you don't have charity you become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol because you're missing the main thing that's it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity you're missing the main thing because you're nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feel the poor and though I give my body to be Burns and have not charity it profiteth me nothing Hallelujah so after all that after you featured on on on wherever you're featured and everybody talk about you and they get the accolades and awards if you miss the main thing he still don't want that it goes on to say charity suffereth long and is kind amen amen so you can't be rude and rough he say Envy it not vaunt it not itself and is not puffed up so he's still looking for humility in this bride these are the attributes he laid out you know this is what he looking for he said rejoice it not in iniquity sorry in verse five do not behave it self unseemingly unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think it no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoice it in the truth bear it all things believe it all things hope it all things endure it all things charity never faileth that's the main thing we talking about that's the main thing but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come he's still looking for Perfection know not no halfway bride not what halfway Church Halfway Christian no he looking for Perfection that's the main thing but he say that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away amenallah so that's what he looking for he wants a Perfect Bride that could love him that's a bride who could be humble kind loving loving your neighbor loving your enemy loving the boss loving that employee that you know don't like you that's it he wants you to be wise not not foolish obedient to his word am caring am trusting him and his word having faith to believe that he who made the promise is able to complete it by himself with or without you he don't need your help or support that's the kind of bride he looking for that's the main thing that's it he wants that you stay with the word hallelujah not run off and do your own thing he want you to stick with the word because he said listen prophecies will fail knowledge will vanish away but his word cannot fail it will never fail it's the same yesterday today and forever hallu thank you Lord like I said Jesus is coming for a Perfect Bride so what he did he dropped some time right so he give the bride the ability to to add these things because he want the bride to get ready you know in in Noah's day you could have do what you want but you see when the time came it was only one thing was important you know if you're in the ark if you was out the ark it didn't matter how long you went to church how much books you read or if Noah was your cousin it didn't matter the main thing was you had to be in the ark to be saved Amen in Moses day it didn't matter if Moses was your longtime distant cousin because when he was in Egypt you did a favor for him it didn't matter what he wanted is that he wanted something on the doorpost when I see that blood I will pass it didn't have favors and because it's you and be real good and it's long time no it didn't matter as matter of fact he say when judgment come you want to start from the ancient men come come down no respect to persons it didn't matter how how long you're there how long how how much you help and how much you contribute and how much you give of yourself it didn't matter because when we check the attributes there if you don't have love and love for his word hallelujah this is not mandated and and he will beat you to do this no because you love him and because you respect him then you're obedient to his word so you will honor him and you will do the things that is pleasing to him and the things that he want done amen it that's the main thing that's it so it's no longer about you but it's about him that's it that's what he's coming for you know hallelujah what he want is he want his Spirit to dwell in you so when he look at you he could say there is my spirit flowing freely yes when he look at you you leaking Faith virtue leaking out it it it it running over yes all them virtues that you love just because you don't even know why where where the world feel that you should hate and you should condemn you just love because that's not you know that's Christ in you that's the word being in the bride and when the word is in the bride you have no choice it's innate there's a word in English called innate it mean building it's not putting on a Sprinkle a little bit and you get a little bit and you know what you have patience today no it's in you so it's the only thing that could come out of you amen that's how he wants us he wants his word to be in us so when we walk you could see Jesus amen when you open the Bible every chapter every verse every line you see see Jesus when you speak you speak Jesus when you you you you have interaction with somebody else they know listen this is not you there's Christ in you that's what they see it's no longer about you so you can't take glory in that so you reflect him amen that's what he looking for he want the word to live in you he want to dwell in you thank you thank you Lord now from from a message a paradox paragraph 168 where Bram said now Pentecost was a paradox all right how that God chose a bunch of illiterate fishermen that didn't even know their ABCs there is soul that Peter couldn't even sign his own name huah the Bible said he and John in Acts for was ignorant and unlearned but yet yet they take notice you know what they took notice of that they've been with Jesus so once again that that eliminates intellect it it eliminates your Academia and and your qualifications and and how worthy you are and how long you wrong and you study the Scripture it eliminates all that because yes when you've been with Jesus you know what say he say that's the main thing that is the main thing in a message leadership paragraph 36 and I want to stay here a little bit all right you you know what before I go there all right let let me read the rest of that scripture all right I stopped at at verse 22 so I just want to go on from verse 23 to 30 amen so that's Matthew 19 verse 23-30 and it said then said Jesus unto his disciples now this is after he spoke to the Rich Young Ruler and he went away very sorrowful amen because he had great possessions right in verse 23 then said Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you yes that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven all right and again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle and for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven so you're making sure you understand the point yes in verse 25 he says when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved because if the Rich Young Ruler who was here before who who obey all the Commandments and he is not rich because because he wants to be rich he he is Rich because he has followed everything that he's supposed to do and the world will call him a successful guy right so when you tell us that it's hard difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven who then can be saved and and in verse 26 Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible then answered Peter and said unto him behold this our testimony now we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and then he gave the answer that the Rich Young Ruler had asked him initially by this time he was gone but he was given the disciples the answer in verse 29 and everyone that had forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake my name sake shall receive and H hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life but many that are first shall be last and last shall be first amen hallelujah now it's very clear that the Rich Young Ruler came and asked what do I need to do yes to inherit eternal life what has to happen what what are not doing what are doing wrong because when I check checklist I take off everything that a Believer supposed to do and in a message leadership paragraph 36 Hallelujah the prophet said because remember you're going to you're going to die someday and either be translated into heaven and if you die before his coming you'll be raptured first did did you know know that did you know those who are dead if Mama and Papa dies before you and Jesus doesn't come in our generation do you know these Mama Papa and Mama will come forth first glorified before you see the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them we'll be changed like that we've got to remember that's the main thing in life he said you understand now that's the main thing in life we got to do is to get ready to meet God Amen so after all is said and done after all the scriptures after all the sermons the messages and you share a thought the main thing is you have to get ready to meet God Amen now it continues Hallelujah in paragraph 37 and he says now just religion won't work see the young this one Young Ruler here said good Master now remember before I say it he had been taught to walk right so this is not a hooligan this is not somebody who pretending to be good yeah this is not somebody pretending to be a success he had been taught to work right he had a good education he had been taught business he was rich he was a ruler and had religion but he was confronted with another problem and it confronts all of us all of us eternal life Hallelujah because we know the main thing is you have to get ready to meet God Amen am so this is the issue he had religion doesn't give us eternal life coming to church don't give you Eternal Life Fellowship don't give you eternal life singing on a morning to give you eternal life religious is a covering but it don't give us eternal life and yet him taught with the best teachers there was he was yet lacking something and the young man knew it because he said good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life now you you believe Jesus as God don't you so he knew the thoughts of the young man so Jesus knew what he was thinking Jesus could have addressed him immediately he knew his thoughts Hallelujah but he said keep the Commandments he went right back to his religion to see what he would say about his religion all right he said now in other words keep your religion yes he said I have did this since a boy little boys like you my mama and papa my priests taught me religion but I know in my religion that I still don't have eternal life see you can be good don't steal don't smoke don't don't lie don't lie to Papa and Mama don't tell the first lie because when you tell the first lie it's easy to tell another one see but you mustn't do it don't tell the first one Prophet said in paragraph 41 did you know your body is not made to lie we're not created to lie chemically scientifically we were not created to lie he said why because lie is such a horrible thing the body wasn't made to lie it's such a horrible thing till it upsets the whole nerve system when you lie upsets like that will give you ulcers fungus growth it'll kill you and then a li is a Bad Thing C see you're not supposed to lie to steal to do any of these things so this young man had probably been he hadn't lied died he never stole he was conscious that he needed ever eternal life that's what he needed he was aware of that so he said what can I do to have it and Jesus is showing here that religion won't do it so being present on a Sunday and a Wednesday and in Zoom prayer meeting on a Friday is not good enough amen that won't do it you know you have to be able to focus on the main thing yes and know the main thing and what is important to you and to God Amen Hallelujah so he knew he didn't have eternal life so he said if you would enter into life eternal life want to be perfect then if you want that you need to go sell all you have see now it's all right to have money see it's all right to be rich to be a ruler all those things are right yes the challenge with him wasn't because he had money you know wasn't because he was a young fell wasn't because he was a ruler but he had another challenge and the prophet here he said that's all right but it's the way you act after you become that see so when he said go sell what you've got and give it to the poor them people that hasn't got anything then come follow me and you will have Treasures in Heaven but the young man had so much money till he didn't know what to do with it now he was very popular that young man he was very well equipped for life the way his father and mother and the priest and all of them had equipped him but he still know he lacked something now I'm talking to the adults he know he lacked something and he didn't have eternal life he knew it religion wouldn't produce itlu form sensation you feel some something you get scared you feel something crying GL that still ain't it all right you're confronted with eternal life so now we digging a little deeper into what this main thing is right we don't just want to live and operate and have religion and go to church and say we believe and we trying to be good but we need to seek out those things that we lack the things we need amen don't worry I I wouldn't be long so in a message Harvest time yes still speaking of the main thing paragraph 108 he said now notice God in the beginning we're going to back to the word the very first thing he gave his children to live by was his word now we find that is the truth amen then in the middle of the Bible we hear Jesus come and say man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen and then in revelation 22 Jesus himself speaking again said I testify of these things if any man shall add one word to this or take one word out this book word of this book out his part will be taken from the book of life now see it's not our good living that's just something that goes with it it isn't our church loyalty that goes with it but the main thing is staying with that word don't eat nothing else but that word stay with it he is that word that's what you want you want to stay with that word that's the main thing because the word is what's going to prepare you to meet God the word is what's going to clothe you with that wedding garment the word will give you the guidelines and the instructions in order to fulfill that role as bride because he paid a price not just for for any old shabby thing he want a perfect Brad who could handle his word and could slice and cut and stay with it and say this is the main thing and I staying with this and I have faith and I believe this word and I trust this word and I stay in with this word amen that's what he wants that's the main thing that's it in the message of Absolut and absolute yes paragraph 19 he say it's nothing nothing so mysterious he say it's finding God right earlier on we say Peter and they their testimony that was that they've been with Jesus in this case you say it's finding God to getting yourself out the way and letting the Holy Spirit use you to do whatever he wants to do that's it he said that's the main thing of any gift is getting your own ideas away and let Christ be in charge he must have control he say then what what he said if you want to know whether it's Christ or not if it's just a sensation leave it alone but if it's just an emotion leave it alone but if it's written in the word then it's godu if you could find it in the word then it's God he say always judge everything it doesn't matter who presents it judge everything by presenting the word test drop the word test on it and see if it could pass that if it can't pass the word test it fail am it fall it it it's of no use we want to stick with the main thing and the main thing is it must match the word the main thing is you have to stay with the word the main thing is it must line up with the word line upon line it must be found there Hallelujah you say if you don't do do do that you're lost you know if you don't do that you're lost thank you Lord hallelujah in a message token paragraph 131 he says and I tell you today brother it ain't how you comb your hair or what you do hallelujah or what kind of clothes you wear what kind of PhD you got I if I hear that God is among you that's the main thing that's the kind of church you want to be in a church with God walking moving yeah it doesn't matter how how intelligent you believe you are how much degrees you think you have hallelujah how much suits your we if it's a three piece or a two piece or no none at all at the end of the day he say the main thing is that God is among you whether you have a suit or a tie or not God have to be among you he has to dwell among you amen amen he said want to know where God is among this look at the organizations Hallelujah today I said look at the churches look at groups where are they going to is God among them is if not they being led straight to the Council of churches straight on a straight pathu it doesn't matter who the pastor ISJ if God is not among them they have a problem that lead straight back to the mark of the beast God is not in that God is in his word for he is the word that's exactly I have heard the faith listen Faith cometh not by hearing the counsel or the opinions of men you know Faith don't come by listening to some some nice motivational speech you know Faith come by his word amen and his word creates Faith amen hearing the word this seen this and they knowed she knew it was the truth she asked for Mercy going back to to to to Joshua and they there she say she asks for Mercy watch for both her and her family she asks for her and her family just like they did in Egypt notice there was given to her a token a red token that a Scarlet string she let the people despised down out of the window and that string was to be a token in her time that was the thing that's the thing she needed to have God would not destroy an angel would not come near her as long as she had the token but what if she say oh I let them down I done a good deed so now to keep anybody from criticizing me seeing the Scarlet rope hanging out here I'll pull the Rope back what what what if she was like that Hallelujah the judge the Judgment Angel would have never passed over her house Hallelujah she had to have the token displayed it had to remain there so you tell me in this age how does that line up when we look at the word is there a token for this age that we need to have if we don't have the token on display yes what the Judgment Angel have to do they can't Passover because listen here rules Hallelujah is not dependent on you it's not dependent on me it's not dependent on History it's one thing they looking for they're looking for the token that's the main thing that's it the main thing is you show the token so you show the ticket you show the pass so you can pass outside of that you get lick up outside of that there's no hope outside of that you're lost outside that you fail if you don't have the token on display which is the main thing in this hour you have nothing you could give to the poor you could sing in the choir you could have a Poe and contribute in whatever way you believe if you don't have what a destroying Angel looking for that is the token that's the main thing that's it he have no choice but to execute judgment because that's the instruction to look for the main thing he not coming to see the the color the clothes you wear he not I'm going see the style your here he coming for the token that's the identifier that's the mark you looking for that's the main thing and if you have that then you could Rejoice tonight then you could shout then you could be in Revival because you know you're striving for for for for perfection because you're striving to ensure that you have the main [Applause] thing it wonderful hallelujah amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah we winding down you know we're winding down because at the end of the day I think it's clear God's word hallelujah is so simple yes that you don't need a master's or a doctorate you don't need you know some great Theologian to come to explain Hallelujah he said listen this is what I'm looking for right I am willing to pay I'm willing to sacrifice I'm willing to give the best that I have because I value this bride so much Hallelujah that I am willing yes to send my only son sacrifice him born of a virgin to be tested and tried on this Earth just like you and I listen because he realized at the end of the day the bride he looking for is special he don't want any old bride he want a bride that can not be deceived amen a bride that will put on the full armor a bride that could represent and reflect him a bride that could be Jesus Christ on two feet Hallelujah a bride where the virtues could be running through and leaking out because they love him so much that they trust his word and apply it to their life that's what he looking for right he don't trust anybody with his bride so he set the guidelines it's not man determining this he said this is what I want I want you to love me I want you to serve me I want you to worship me I want you to pray I want communion with you I want fellowship with you listen I want you to love your brother and your neighbor cuz when you do that you do it unto me I want you to work when you work you work unto me I want you to have the right attitude because the right attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass he leave promises that are very specific very specifically geared to his bride and he said listen all you have to do is do do do these things you know follow these steps just add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness add charity so he gave a guideline and you say listen this is the main thing so when I come essentially imagine as a father you walk out your house and just before you leave you say son here what I want when I reach back here I want you to clean up your bedroom all right all right and you walk out and leave now you know what the instructions are the instructions are clean up your bedroom so imagine you as the son hearing the instruction and you know what you decide I go in and do a painting for daddy boy I go and paint a picture of Daddy and I decide here are going and and craft some mural or something for daddy cuz I love daddyy so much and you know what else are going and do I feel I going to make a sand castle in the house for Daddy because daddy like to go to the beach no no no no no so here's what happens in that scenario when the father returns he sanca look nice the mural look nice the painting look nice but what's the main thing the main thing is he give an instruction that that room must be clean yes so if he come on the room dirty and God forbid they get licks there's a consequence for not being able to present the main thingu because his instructions were very very clear it wasn't complicated and listen it was listen God is not in the Treasure Island he is not in the I forget long time they used to have a thing where you get a clue here and you go here and you get a clue there and you run down so and you find the next clue God is nothing in that God is God in Simplicity he gave clearly defined instructions that even the uneducated and illiterate could understand these fishermen that couldn't sign the name was able to understand he said in that time T in Jerusalem wait in Jerusalem just wait until you be indued with power from on high so his instruction is always simple he didn't say listen I want you to go down there and make a left and count 10 steps and walk backwards flip on your head no no no no no he said very specific Noah here what I want you do build an ark and you building your own Ark I giv you the guidelines I giv you the instructions he said Moses here here what I want you to go to Egypt but don't just go because at the end of the day God want the glory so he don't want you just go he say this is how I want you to go I want you go and you be me all right and Aeron will be you all right I want you to go and don't want you just set them free and say Let Let My People Go I want you to bring them from there to a mountain to worship on the next side very clear instructions in Joshua time he say listen I want you to walk around once every day Hallelujah and on the seven day seven times in Gideon case he said listen every man that lap in the water like that only choose them leave everybody else alone and when you go these are the instructions you have a picture you have a lamp you break the picture very very specific so he don't want to he don't want you to mess it up you knowall I I remember one time my brother he he he showed me a concept and he he he taught me a concept he said he learned that a guy said listen when you want to make sure your business works well like a well oil M machine you need to make things stupid proof when you don't want mistakes and you want quality and you want the same result every time you need to make sure it's not open to random interpretations so in doing so God real careful with his bride he don't want anybody manhandle his bride so he give very specific instructions that every individual could understand because he said listen at the end of the day I coming for the token are coming for the main thing and I want you to know in advance not everybody will listen so he say one will be taken and the other will be left because he gives Specific Instructions and not everybody could be humble enough to be obedient enough to be able to apply that instruction to their life as we close there's a message of testimony upon the sea paragraph 103 brother brandham said and listen now he said it'll make you get in a mess that's what's the matter with people today they don't like the new birth Hallelujah they try to make it something else they want to shake hands and say I believe in God Almighty the father I believe in in this case Holy Roman Catholic Church communion of his Saints and I I take him for for for my savior and Born Again uh-huh no no no no no he said listen brother the new Birds more than that listen I want to tell you some something any birth is a mess and let me tell you the new birth is nothing less it's a mess you'll scrl and ball and wash all the paint off your face with tears but you have to die but it brings new life he said that's the main thing it'll bring new life and you'll be a different creature H he want to get rid of of the old heart you have the old Behavior the old you he want to take he want his Spirit dwell in you he said you'll be a different creature it'll make a mess out of you but you have to do that to be born again you have to be messy see but it'll bring new life hallelujah amen that's the main thing amen you know let's just stand hallelujah hallelujah let just stand as weu as we closeu let's just bow our heads at this time oh Heavenly Father
