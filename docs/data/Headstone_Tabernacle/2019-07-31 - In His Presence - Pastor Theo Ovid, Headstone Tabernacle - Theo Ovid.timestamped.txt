[16:13] to eat wanna go just in John chapter 12
[16:16] when I read from verse 20 to 28
[16:21] Isaiah chapter 6 beat him for this one

[16:42] not in vain we didn't chapter 6 of
[16:45] Isaiah in the year that King Uzziah died
[16:47] I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne
[16:50] high and lifted up his train filled the
[16:53] temple above it stood the Seraphim each
[16:57] one had six wings with twain he covered
[16:58] his face between he covered his feet
[17:01] between it it fly one cried unto another
[17:04] and said holy holy is a lot of hosts the
[17:06] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[17:09] post of the door moved at the voice of
[17:12] him that cried and houses for which
[17:14] smoke then said I o is me if I'm undone
[17:18] because I'm a man of unclean lips and I
[17:21] dwell in the midst of a people of
[17:22] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[17:25] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[17:28] the seraphim's unto me having a live
[17:31] coal in his hand which he had taken from
[17:33] with the tongs from of the altar and he
[17:36] laid it upon my Mountain I said lo they
[17:39] said our lips and then iniquity is taken
[17:41] away and I stand purged and I hear the
[17:45] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[17:47] send and who will go for us then said I
[17:50] here am I send me
[17:52] our last scripture fobs in John chapter
[17:55] 12 we didn't for verse 20 and there were
[17:57] certain Greeks among them that came to
[17:59] worship at the feast the same came
[18:01] therefore to Philip which was of
[18:03] Bethesda of Galilee and desired him
[18:05] saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip
[18:08] comment and telleth Andrew and Andrew
[18:09] and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered
[18:11] them seen they always come but the son
[18:14] of man should be glorified fairly very
[18:16] light unto you
[18:17] except the corner wheat fall into the
[18:19] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[18:21] it die it bringeth forth much fruit he
[18:23] that loveth his life shall lose it he
[18:25] that hated his life in this world shall
[18:27] keep it under life eternal if any man
[18:29] serve me let him follow me
[18:31] away I am there shall also my Stephen be
[18:33] if any man serve me him will my father
[18:36] honour now is my soul troubled and what
[18:38] shall I say father save me from this
[18:41] hour but for this cause came I unto this
[18:43] hour
[18:44] father glorify thy name then came their
[18:46] voice from heaven saying I have both
[18:49] glorified it I will glorify it again
[18:52] let us pray father we thank you for your
[18:54] word tonight come into it Lord and bring
[18:56] us into your divine presence Lord and
[18:58] have the preeminence is Lord we love you
[19:01] tonight we thank you for this way that
[19:03] you have made for us and it's
[19:04] opportunity that you have given to us to
[19:06] access your Greece to access your love
[19:09] to access your presence granted father
[19:11] that your presence will be so will fill
[19:13] this place so much Lord that the people
[19:16] would leave there but change lives and
[19:17] change hearts change minds change
[19:19] attitudes transform souls granted father
[19:22] in Jesus and we ask it amen and amen
[19:24] you may be seated who praise the Lord
[19:27] hallelujah love him tonight it's always
[19:32] good to be in the presence of God
[19:34] tonight our title three words in his
[19:39] presence in his presence that's what I
[19:42] got tonight in his presence but Obama is
[19:45] saying that there was some I'm talking
[19:47] about these Greeks and they worship all
[19:49] kind of the gods and so on
[19:51] so Jesus attracted the attention and
[19:53] people that want to find Jesus is to
[19:56] find somebody who knows how to take them
[19:59] to him so that's why they came to the
[20:01] disciples because recycle is supposed to
[20:04] know whether to take care to isn't that
[20:07] right so a leader or one of his servants
[20:09] is the way they find them I want to read
[20:11] it again what usually the way that
[20:15] people want to find Jesus is to find
[20:17] somebody who knows how to take them to
[20:21] him a leader or one of his servants is
[20:24] the way define him
[20:25] so Jesus here we go if he ever chooses a
[20:28] servant he always chooses somebody that
[20:31] will bring the people to him what yes
[20:35] bring the people to who to him because
[20:38] it is his purpose to save the people
[20:40] now he find that they brought his watch
[20:43] that we find that they brought into his
[20:45] presence these Greeks Philip they
[20:47] consulted Philip and Philip said now
[20:49] here is someone I want to see our Lord
[20:51] so it wouldn't be just right for me to
[20:53] have the honor to introduce these Greeks
[20:55] to my lord I go get Andrew to go with me
[20:57] so they went and got Andrew and Andrew
[20:59] and Philip came and presented the Greeks
[21:02] to Jesus now there is a great thing
[21:04] that's the text that's unusual there's
[21:06] as soon as these Greeks are pointed to
[21:07] Jesus Jesus did not point to himself he
[21:11] did not make himself known to them
[21:13] because you cannot know Jesus in that
[21:15] way
[21:16] Jesus is known in that way the Greeks
[21:19] brought up that Jesus was in his
[21:21] presence it looks like Jesus would have
[21:24] said well I'm the Messiah of the Jewish
[21:26] race thus predicted by the prophets my
[21:28] inspiration down to the centuries I'm
[21:30] here now
[21:31] I am the board of Nazareth I'm a Jewish
[21:33] mother my father is God I'm here to make
[21:36] myself known to you Greeks that's sort
[21:39] of like holding modern ones this do
[21:40] today with the flag on VHS and show
[21:43] their muscles right but that's that
[21:45] would be more nineteen nineteen sixty
[21:47] one version of it program as soon as
[21:50] they brought in his presence that's the
[21:53] main thing get the people in his
[21:57] presence you see the object of this
[21:59] message is to bring people into presence
[22:02] not just information not just revelation
[22:06] but the word is supposed to bring you
[22:09] and I into presence or give the Lord
[22:12] some praises hallelujah get the people
[22:17] in his presence and as soon as as in his
[22:20] presence Jesus except a corn of wheat
[22:22] falls into the wrong and die it abides
[22:24] alone what an unusual thing instead of
[22:27] accepting the introduction the thing
[22:30] that he done was pointing them to the
[22:32] place that they could find him
[22:34] Oh glory to God hallelujah the place to
[22:37] find him yes some church some wait no no
[22:39] no he's pointing them to please
[22:41] except for corn or wheat fortune of
[22:44] growing and Danza but what if every
[22:46] pastor preaches is Donnelly what every
[22:50] minutes every elder point to people to
[22:51] Christ
[22:52] what are we finally gonna have it what
[22:56] the husband point the wife took Christ
[22:57] the wife pointed the husband to Christ
[23:00] your behavior is in Christ
[23:02] hey Jesus go behave like that how you
[23:03] behave and so ocher could imagine that
[23:06] could you imagine a husband telling my
[23:09] wife Jesus oh you people do even just
[23:11] like Jesus oh god I love you even more
[23:13] and the white tail in the husband that
[23:15] is just how Jesus was gonna be you and
[23:17] the children telling the parents that's
[23:19] og Livie here I'm the parent selling the
[23:21] chair that's how Jesus that's all now
[23:23] you're supposed to be here you know okay
[23:34] what did he do here
[23:35] he pointed him to that great truth how
[23:39] to see him they could not see him and
[23:42] the way of eternal life just standing
[23:43] there like he was he was a man so if we
[23:50] if it's so hard to see what the Prophet
[23:53] say we could talk and explain listen to
[24:03] what it is you know if we ourselves in
[24:06] our ministry in our thoughts in our life
[24:11] so he's talking about me pulpit to the
[24:14] Pew if we abide as we are we can do no
[24:19] good we have got to also die at the
[24:23] altar or we will live alone we will lift
[24:29] the some denomination or some Creed we
[24:31] will lift us some organization but if we
[24:33] die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit
[24:38] will be spread forth
[24:41] everywhere by our lips
[24:44] oh the mean enough to come back to that
[24:50] you mean the Holy Spirit was spread by
[24:53] the lips of Peter in the house of
[24:56] Cornelius because Peter was in the body
[24:58] and life was coming from the body the
[25:02] Mende returning to that while Peter yet
[25:04] spake these words Peter brought them
[25:07] into presence he then brought them under
[25:10] the anointing it wasn't just the
[25:12] breaking of the word was spirit and work
[25:15] together or get a lot of shock don't you
[25:19] want to see that don't you want to
[25:21] experience that or hallelujah you must
[25:25] want that tonight if we die to ourselves
[25:28] then the Holy Spirit will be spread
[25:31] forth everywhere by our lips we have got
[25:34] to die so many today we must realize
[25:39] that we have got to die in order to
[25:42] bring forth new life so he said so much
[25:44] of this if you want to see me you must
[25:46] die to yourself and then you will bring
[25:49] forth a new life but if we want to see
[25:52] him if you ever expect to see him you
[25:54] will never see him by joining a church
[25:56] some books of laws you keep some crease
[26:00] of yourself you will see him when you
[26:02] die when you come to Calvary and a
[26:06] crucified to yourself then you will see
[26:08] Jesus we would see him first before he
[26:10] said anything he pointed them to the
[26:12] place to find him like all Gentiles of
[26:15] all people you find Jesus a cross where
[26:17] you are crucified with him today we
[26:20] tried to fight him in everything find a
[26:22] fundamental choice building California
[26:24] mental domination can define him by
[26:26] saying some Creed we try to find him by
[26:28] keeping us sitting days or being certain
[26:30] rituals and I'd find him till become to
[26:33] Calvary dear we are crucified fall into
[26:37] the dust of the earth and died ourselves
[26:40] then reborn again then we find Jesus so
[26:43] many tried today to hold themselves and
[26:45] maintain their ideas I've got my way of
[26:47] it I believe this
[26:49] you see that is bad I believe this and
[26:52] if I believe this you know believe like
[26:54] me you off
[26:55] oh gee is that no matter that's it this
[26:58] is belief I believe and you believe and
[27:01] it's unbelief where's Jesus Jesus
[27:05] another belief this is a person I pushed
[27:08] me after meeting Harlan I want your
[27:11] meeting here same two days I look me
[27:13] here no he said let me cross you're
[27:16] gonna find me when you go dear
[27:18] hallelujah when you recognize you have
[27:20] to die and they come at the presence and
[27:22] you're gonna find out the sake of
[27:23] presence and the responsibility of
[27:24] presence you talk about that tonight
[27:26] okay the Lord some praises you right
[27:29] over me tonight
[27:30] alright so watch that is so many try you
[27:33] cannot find Christ to watch watch so
[27:35] many try to do to hold their selves
[27:37] maintain your own idea I've got my way
[27:40] of it I believe this but you cannot find
[27:42] Christ until you died yourself accept
[27:43] him the word then you find like that's
[27:46] why I say that the people have no
[27:47] disease in men actually who your posture
[27:49] is first or what you should go to then
[27:51] according to what you see then you see
[27:53] well you know oh ho and then the
[27:55] antennas go although you see but if that
[27:58] discernment they don't judge you by what
[27:59] church you go to or who your pastor is
[28:01] they're judging by what spirit inside of
[28:03] you or give the law some praises so we
[28:06] have to come at a genuine Holy Ghost
[28:08] scriptural discernment where you have to
[28:10] listen when somebody whether they have
[28:12] old clothes or new clothes it doesn't
[28:13] matter be closed its spirit a male it's
[28:16] what spirit like behind me whether you
[28:18] call me over here call me that will make
[28:20] them a Christian or come on I'll say
[28:22] Amen somebody Oh hallelujah whether
[28:24] their shoes have a hole in it that
[28:26] doesn't make him a Christian the kind of
[28:27] a hole in your shoes or glory to God or
[28:29] not you're still a Christian Alleluia
[28:32] you could be me models and still be a
[28:33] Christian because the Christ you will
[28:35] make you a Christian that Mattos is
[28:36] mental or glory to God you could lose
[28:39] your mind it doesn't change what inside
[28:40] your heart or give the Lord as you get
[28:42] there are some praises - one thing on
[28:45] heart is one thing or glory to God
[28:48] hallelujah praise God got to see what's
[28:51] inside that deal it and say he's a man
[28:53] after my own heart

[40:29] hallelujah you in the same shape
[40:31] something have to happen hallelujah
[40:33] praise God and you can look to yourself
[40:36] you look to the Lord to inspire you
[40:39] yourself have to come under the
[40:41] inspiration you yourself have to be
[40:43] inspired just appreciate to get
[40:45] inspiration to bring his message you
[40:47] have to get inspiration as a believer
[40:49] believers inspired you know it's a peace
[40:52] sign shall follow then I believe you
[40:53] know that scripture for believers you
[40:55] know you don't have to inspire you you
[40:57] have to be annoying table design
[41:00] shall follow them that believe you have
[41:03] to take that upon yourself as your
[41:05] scripture they shall lay hands upon the
[41:08] sick and they shall recover and my name
[41:10] is shall cast out devils if they drink
[41:12] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[41:15] or glory that one why because you are
[41:17] believer and cocolonia we'll true
[41:20] believers so God will test what you
[41:22] really believe or glory that God may be
[41:27] the true disciple of Christ he believes
[41:29] that a cross oh praise God so the reason
[41:36] they didn't accept Jesus because they
[41:38] were living in the glare of the law and
[41:40] when Jesus came he was contrary to the
[41:42] law but he come to fulfill the law they
[41:45] couldn't accept him because his message
[41:47] wasn't exactly the way they had tweeted
[41:49] it out it wasn't in the tradition they
[41:53] come like chemistry in that here they
[41:55] have the only local taste of holy
[41:58] messages to be presented and if you
[42:00] don't come according to local teas it's
[42:02] a problem now I ain't talking Yankee and
[42:05] I ain't talking American I ain't talking
[42:06] English I talking just obvious talk here
[42:08] but this is a different approach because
[42:11] this is bringing these promises from
[42:12] this year and some people don't like
[42:14] that they like if any preacher could
[42:15] explain things and talk things and just
[42:17] talk just killing time talking and just
[42:19] making up some time but this is the word
[42:21] here watch they couldn't accept him
[42:24] because his mission was exactly the way
[42:25] they had it all cleared out and it
[42:27] wasn't called it was ten call traditions
[42:29] didn't come according to their
[42:30] traditions he didn't keep the traditions
[42:32] and really he upset it and toy top don't
[42:36] think that was contracted in so much
[42:38] that they thought he was breaking up the
[42:39] churches but they couldn't receive him
[42:42] because of his message and we know today
[42:45] he's come exactly in line with God's
[42:47] prophecy and didn't know them and it
[42:49] could happen again and we wouldn't know
[42:51] it I imagine if he would actually appear
[42:53] tonight it would be so contrary that
[42:55] what we gotta figure in our chance no
[42:58] they have chance okay no chance I know
[43:01] school and things that I see when they
[43:02] make the chance it has to come up on to
[43:04] the job because they make it up
[43:07] Oh Harlan but God common tickets would
[43:09] and interpreted and he will begin the
[43:11] tickets with know what you're gonna
[43:12] begin to see you will see Court
[43:14] interpreting the would in your own life
[43:16] that's is what you want begin to see now
[43:18] God beginning to interpret the word in
[43:21] your own life
[43:22] oh praise God hallelujah but a Branham
[43:27] he said no watch the look we get in
[43:30] slothful the churches get them so
[43:31] worldly so indifferent their mind so
[43:33] muddled up with television we love Suzy
[43:35] and you can't tell them these things are
[43:37] wrong and they think you're crazy what
[43:39] is it
[43:40] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[43:41] God he said the greatest pleasure I know
[43:44] of is to pray until I can realize that
[43:48] I'm in the presence of God and recognize
[43:51] it I team that oughta be the chill of
[43:53] the church is the presence of the Holy
[43:56] Spirit
[43:56] seeing the God that made a promise
[43:59] standing among us and to feel his
[44:01] presence and to see his word under see
[44:04] it finding it ought to give faith to
[44:06] make the cripples walk the blind see the
[44:08] Deaf hear the dumb speak all glory to
[44:12] God so when we come into the presence
[44:13] you've commented the supernatural
[44:15] you're coming under the expectation but
[44:16] God to do miracles among you listen
[44:18] biblical sit there intellectual with no
[44:20] expectation forgot to move or glory to
[44:23] God is sitting there for information
[44:25] this isn't if a revelation and
[44:27] understanding but when you begin to
[44:28] understand you have to come into
[44:30] presence then is beyond the man behind
[44:32] the pulpit or God is beyond eaten and
[44:35] illidan and laws of the church he won't
[44:37] be on that Oh hallelujah
[44:42] understand this the woman with the blood
[44:45] issue example she came and Paula self
[44:50] touch to him of his garment she wasn't
[44:52] coming to a man he was coming to a bank
[44:55] she was coming to make a withdrawal she
[44:58] had coming to see Jesus the imine stand
[45:00] in the air and speak in words she had
[45:02] come to hear no words she was Marian or
[45:04] Sherman he has come to touch the hem of
[45:07] His garment because she recognized power
[45:09] was resident in that man or glory the
[45:13] corner what he have to lose out what he
[45:18] she had said to pull it out there where
[45:20] everybody was around him everybody
[45:22] touching him and bouncing him and they
[45:24] get in that pain but this woman well
[45:27] Cory got this woman well hallelujah push
[45:30] she crawled she move along until she get
[45:33] to touch him
[45:34] then she withdraw from that bank of
[45:36] power or glory there go easy who touched
[45:38] my clothes because everybody touching
[45:41] her he said no no no no no this touch
[45:43] was different Oh glory to God somebody
[45:46] with draw somebody pulled on the power
[45:48] somebody pull up anointing somebody pull
[45:51] out virtue power for sinners somebody
[45:53] joy it out or give the Lord a shout
[45:55] then Jesus knew who would draw he said
[45:58] woman died maybe hole he didn't say my
[46:01] power or my virtue the fate Oh glory to
[46:05] God and what did whatever I was sent to
[46:07] do he said to tune your hearts back what
[46:09] to the faith of the Father success what
[46:12] the fitme success see it say it again
[46:16] your faith was like that power will give
[46:19] the Lord a shout so you have to know
[46:21] tonight that you have what it takes to
[46:24] pull down the power of God now if I
[46:31] don't speak this you wouldn't know you
[46:32] have it and you wouldn't expect it they
[46:35] will expect me to bring word wood wood
[46:37] I'm telling you we have to change over
[46:39] under the expectation for the power of
[46:42] bottle ricochet to the church when that
[46:47] glory came knowing Solomon dedicated a
[46:50] temporal the minister could not minister
[46:52] because the glory of God came and sell
[46:55] the whole house but was so pleased but
[46:57] the wisdom of Solomon and the burden of
[47:00] Solomon to bring a temples of God and
[47:02] this is a temple to be built and live in
[47:05] hate living with you live in knowledge
[47:07] this touch of a perfect man and living
[47:10] host a living brain Squad monument of
[47:14] the God's plan in place and when that
[47:16] homes is built I could see the glory I
[47:19] could see the power I can see the
[47:21] anointing coming up on that house
[47:26] [Music]
[47:27] what with the strong that holds my glory
[47:32] hallelujah when he is not recognized
[47:38] this power is not revealed when he is
[47:42] not recognized no matter how much God is
[47:45] standing present you have got to believe
[47:47] it you know I took my woman and they
[47:49] were caught behind the country we do one
[47:50] more blood issue but Ron T when he is
[47:53] not recognized this power is always not
[47:56] revealed so if you want a revelation of
[47:58] his power if you want to loosen his
[48:00] power you have to begin to recognize
[48:01] they're not coming to church you're
[48:03] coming into presence his presence not
[48:07] the presence of pastor his presence okay
[48:10] the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah
[48:13] what happened this little woman had an
[48:15] issue of blood and she heard about him
[48:17] and when she come down there we go so
[48:18] anybody said she recognized who it was
[48:20] if I could touch him of his garment
[48:22] order standing there might have been
[48:24] sicker than she was but you know what
[48:26] she recognized his presence so that's
[48:28] deep enough not only must you come in
[48:31] but you must recognize his presence and
[48:33] when you recognize his presence you have
[48:34] to act upon what you recognize you're
[48:36] just bored Isis presence is present no
[48:38] act upon it do something in it or glory
[48:42] to God act upon it Lord heal me now but
[48:45] your hand away you're sick do something
[48:47] Oh God fill me now hallelujah deliver me
[48:50] now let's continue if we could only
[48:59] realize that he's appearing to us in
[49:02] these meetings for one purpose one
[49:05] purpose that is to release our desires
[49:07] that we have in him to us but we have to
[49:11] recognize its presence so you have a
[49:14] desire for deliverance of your family
[49:16] that's inside your heart hallelujah and
[49:19] you come here with one purpose for him
[49:21] to release that desire that you have for
[49:24] your family and his presence coming
[49:26] among us and you recognize the presence
[49:28] and I'm not anointing I clean them
[49:31] I claim a complete deliverance every
[49:33] demon to come on my house my home my
[49:35] family hallelujah I came a complete
[49:37] deliverance I plead the blood of Jesus
[49:39] Christ
[49:40] Oh glory to God you're claiming that
[49:42] clip us nothing and 19 you're claiming
[49:44] your healing you're claiming your
[49:46] breakthrough you are playing your feet
[49:48] you're not sitting on here in here in
[49:50] here and now you're acting upon what
[49:52] you're hearing because we are teaching
[49:54] you the keys Oh glory to God to access
[49:56] the spirit Oh hallelujah oh praise God
[50:01] so how how you recognize his presence
[50:04] it's been the promise word for this age
[50:06] is read manifest not the promise would
[50:08] have Moses age or any other age a
[50:10] promise would of this age Oh glory to
[50:12] god that's why brotherly kindness ought
[50:14] to be manifested but the kind of sad to
[50:15] be vindicated it's not to have evidence
[50:17] of brotherly love not just I forgive you
[50:19] but the spirit of brotherly kindness
[50:21] have to strike the truth to strike you
[50:24] as individual people sitting up with
[50:26] anger in church bitterness in church
[50:28] hatefulness in church having odds in the
[50:33] church God forgive him the church and
[50:36] put around prophesy he lost almost all
[50:38] the coins but when the church finds his
[50:41] Brotherhood or glowing equality lawsuit
[50:44] you have to find it we'll give the Lord
[50:45] a show give the Lord a show if the
[50:48] lawsuit has to find it and to find it
[50:51] you have to look for it or get the Lord
[50:54] a show he said she had a whole screening
[50:56] time she swept the walls she swept the
[50:59] floors she swept the walls she swept the
[51:02] cobwebs
[51:02] she says her neighbors could see the
[51:05] dust fly no that is what I want for this
[51:10] church just not to be flying out let
[51:13] other churches laugh let me warm up and
[51:15] let them up and say what they want to
[51:17] see that's a business but you have to
[51:18] clean up gotta clean out to find a coin
[51:22] that you was lost
[51:27] remember pizza and James and general M
[51:30] is a story of us we once had this coin
[51:33] we had once had this power those
[51:35] brothers represented us in the Alpha
[51:37] Church they were us they are our story
[51:45] we went back to that we find in the
[51:49] presence of God God man recognized
[51:52] himself to be sinners so hope somebody
[51:57] could claim and the arrogant and CD that
[52:03] is impossible let me say it again
[52:08] that is impossible a man cannot be
[52:11] arrogant and claim to be in God's
[52:13] presence because you're why we find out
[52:17] in the presence of God man recognize
[52:20] themselves to be sinners we may feel
[52:23] pretty good when we are open different
[52:25] places and feel like we are pretty good
[52:27] people but when we ever come into the
[52:30] presence of God then we see a little bit
[52:33] yeah then we realize how little we are
[52:36] when we realize how great he is and how
[52:39] close we come in the common of the
[52:41] presence it is always showing a great
[52:42] effect upon people who come into the
[52:44] presence of God I have seen the time in
[52:47] my ministry where you would see the
[52:49] presence of God comment in such a place
[52:51] that it would bring a person up and
[52:53] reveal the life to them call all their
[52:56] sins and all kinds any moral acts and
[52:58] bring it as such holy hush among the
[52:59] people till they will drop out of the
[53:01] prayer line before they ever come to be
[53:03] grateful run to the altar and get right
[53:05] with God before they come into his
[53:07] presence there is something about coming
[53:10] into the presence of God it causes
[53:12] things to happen I've seen people in
[53:15] cuts and stretches we have to fight for
[53:20] that you have to sweat for that Oh glory
[53:23] to put it gonna happen again yes you

[1:02:26] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:02:30] Jacob supplant the deceiver run all his

[1:03:18] that's the one to be changed that way
[1:03:20] you know you have to want the stretches

[1:03:40] the much Sun up man chord yeah we go
[1:03:43] back hungry God managers are we to get
[1:03:46] men in deep in his presence then they
[1:03:48] make the decision
[1:03:49] some of them run from him some of them
[1:03:52] run to him so whenever presence coming
[1:03:54] is to direct in the guru you could run
[1:03:56] towards the presence or run away from
[1:03:58] the presence hallelujah you know what
[1:04:01] Jonah did right a man running from the
[1:04:05] presence of the Lord
[1:04:07] collision hallelujah Oh pray Psalm 16:8
[1:04:12] I accept the Lord before me
[1:04:14] this is hold even begin the practice
[1:04:19] practice I have set the Lord before me
[1:04:25] so he could not be confused about it he
[1:04:27] wanted to be listen listen he wanted to
[1:04:30] be conscious of his presence so David
[1:04:33] said I have set the Lord all before my
[1:04:35] face I David I've set the law before my
[1:04:39] face always to be conscious of God's
[1:04:41] presence would not be a good lesson for
[1:04:43] us tonight set the law before our face
[1:04:45] watch.watch so we can be conscious of
[1:04:48] his presence put him first
[1:04:50] put him first wife then you won't sin
[1:04:52] when you are realized that constantly
[1:04:54] you are in the presence of God when you
[1:04:56] realize God is all wrong you'll watch
[1:04:58] what you say you will watch when you do
[1:05:00] you will watch where you go because you
[1:05:02] are conscious you have to set back no
[1:05:05] Emma you have to set that if you have to
[1:05:13] work to achieve a goal like you have a
[1:05:15] yearly goal
[1:05:16] I know same with me a yearly goal or
[1:05:17] five-year goal you want to have thousand
[1:05:20] dollars or whatnot you could break that
[1:05:21] down in two years what months what I've
[1:05:27] been in weeks what I mean in days if
[1:05:29] you're making it by the day you reach a
[1:05:31] goal if you're not making what you're
[1:05:33] supposed to make you but not reach a
[1:05:34] goal well the same thing in God what's
[1:05:36] your goal in going you want that live in
[1:05:38] Fayetteville it won't achieve that by
[1:05:40] your days not by your months by your
[1:05:44] days every day daily depression is you
[1:05:46] have to be committed to prayer every day
[1:05:48] you have to be committed to is praising
[1:05:50] him every day you have to be committed
[1:05:52] to that is a responsibility to move up
[1:05:55] into the presence of God or glory to God
[1:05:58] hallelujah listen listen I have put the
[1:06:01] Lord all before me that's a good thing
[1:06:03] no wonder God said he was a man after
[1:06:05] his own heart man will do anything when
[1:06:07] he think God is near but when we realize
[1:06:10] that God is near did you ever notice a
[1:06:12] sinner let her godly person walk up them
[1:06:13] quit cussing because your presence bring
[1:06:16] conviction on his cousin spirit so our
[1:06:19] SS cousins
[1:06:20] but you just coming up because some
[1:06:23] company Kristin come in when we come
[1:06:25] into his presence we are changed never
[1:06:27] to be the same
[1:06:28] look all to the edges every walk of life
[1:06:30] when well the change life is just for
[1:06:33] ministers no no no this bar boundaries
[1:06:36] again the change life is for the
[1:06:39] minister
[1:06:39] oh no the change life is for everybody
[1:06:45] he's a preacher he's strong he's getting
[1:06:50] most of the blues you know because every
[1:06:51] day they're trying to out him think
[1:06:55] about the thing about this think about
[1:06:56] it now smite the shepherd the sheep will
[1:06:58] scatter never keeps alone he come to
[1:07:05] steal to robbing to kill Oh hallelujah
[1:07:08] are you with me
[1:07:09] so now watch something please let's
[1:07:11] continue so after coming to the presence
[1:07:14] after these things you have seen it and
[1:07:18] coming to his presence you are
[1:07:19] responsible for the message to get to
[1:07:23] somebody else you cannot sit still with
[1:07:25] it you must take it to somebody else how
[1:07:31] much people really come into the
[1:07:32] presence because the presents have an
[1:07:34] effect enough for you any message
[1:07:36] everybody rapture which approach
[1:07:43] presence it's a very fact upon your
[1:07:45] burden comes upon you then you live in
[1:07:48] for God you want to witness you want to
[1:07:50] testify you want to invite people to
[1:07:52] service you want to tell them or the
[1:07:54] Lord because what God has done for you
[1:07:55] somebody testify to you somebody call
[1:07:57] you somebody invited you
[1:07:58] somebody witness to you who are you
[1:08:00] witnessing to them say if you don't give
[1:08:02] God praise and testify your friends have
[1:08:04] bastard in one day it's not the way but
[1:08:09] there is something about it when you
[1:08:11] find Christ you cannot hold your peace
[1:08:12] any longer the rest of your days you are
[1:08:14] changed pushing for when life and life
[1:08:16] comes together it makes a bright light
[1:08:18] and then when the bird connects with the
[1:08:20] wire is a correct bulb it's got to give
[1:08:22] light and when the current and the bug
[1:08:24] gets together there's nothing to
[1:08:25] scuttlebutt right Oh

[1:13:27] epilepsy and that's a devil it's a devil
[1:13:29] that's what it is
[1:13:30] doctors don't know what it is but the
[1:13:32] devil I mean hot clothespin and a rag
[1:13:34] wrapper on it and when he would get
[1:13:36] these fits they were shown in the boy's
[1:13:38] mouth cause he would chew his tongue so
[1:13:40] they brought the boy up he was having
[1:13:42] his fit right on the platform course
[1:13:45] when they get the least bit excited they
[1:13:47] will go into one so while you were
[1:13:49] fixing the pray for the boy I said will
[1:13:50] everyone bow their heads in reverence
[1:13:52] and I preached him the Spirit will not
[1:13:55] leave the boy like this things this way
[1:13:58] you know I look along I see a little
[1:14:01] group sitting there in the place I said
[1:14:02] would you bow your head I said you must
[1:14:04] obey I said that was the Commission if
[1:14:07] you get the people to believe me
[1:14:09] then you be sincere when you pray would
[1:14:11] you bow your head and they laugh at me
[1:14:14] so I turn I wrong and it would not leave
[1:14:17] the boy I know this was hundreds of
[1:14:19] people five times what it is here
[1:14:21] tonight they claimed there was twenty
[1:14:23] eight thousand people there and I said
[1:14:25] he said and then I said I wouldn't do

[1:14:29] dimensional church that was just simply
[1:14:31] laughs a divine healing doesn't believe
[1:14:33] in such a thing I look along the poor
[1:14:35] boy is poured out his mother trying to
[1:14:37] holler crying like that the boy trying
[1:14:39] to swallow and going on I said Heavenly
[1:14:40] Father

[1:14:44] suffer for that guilty group I said this
[1:14:47] is your word I've been honest and told
[1:14:49] him and so many of the epileptics have
[1:14:51] been healed at the meetin I said don't
[1:14:54] let this innocent boy
[1:14:55] have to suffer the mother and father
[1:14:57] brought him here
[1:14:58] for Missy and then I turn and I said in
[1:15:01] the name of the Lord Jesus by faith by
[1:15:04] my commission given to me by Almighty
[1:15:06] God
[1:15:07] this devil cannot hold this boy you are
[1:15:10] at liberty so he's talking to the devil
[1:15:13] you you at Liberty see if the
[1:15:15] disobedient will be disobedient then you
[1:15:17] have Liberty to go to them but come out
[1:15:19] of that boy and I saw 28 people with
[1:15:25] their pasta fall into epilepsy right or
[1:15:29] wrong and I'm wrong I'm wrong and I
[1:15:30] wrong in the floor like that as far as I
[1:15:32] know they still got it here is the

[1:15:39] things then people affect this boy
[1:15:41] hallelujah devil you have to go and if
[1:15:44] the goal you have to go so you're free
[1:15:47] to go so but you have to go because that
[1:15:49] spirit have a destination if if those
[1:15:52] people Reverend it goes straight out
[1:15:55] hallelujah but that ereference brought
[1:15:57] that spirit straight upon them every
[1:15:59] man-jack
[1:16:00] got including pasta that coming back you
[1:16:03] know because it could be caught again on
[1:16:05] this scene you know or Gloria could that
[1:16:08] coming back you know what glory to God
[1:16:10] the manifestation will be the
[1:16:11] interpretation you know going to
[1:16:13] interpret his own work you know go up on
[1:16:14] the vindicate his sons is that man
[1:16:17] chosen is God chosen let's continue
[1:16:20] glory to God hallelujah one time they
[1:16:24] bought a mantle to hypnotize me I guess
[1:16:28] many of you remember that they would
[1:16:30] take him out take army camps take these
[1:16:31] soldiers and hypnotize them make them
[1:16:33] back like a dog and they was going to
[1:16:35] have some fun out of me so I was in the
[1:16:37] auditorium and they brought this man and
[1:16:39] I felt when the prayer line started
[1:16:41] there was an evil spirit somewhere you
[1:16:44] can always pick them and that doubt they
[1:16:46] think they don't it was you could feel
[1:16:48] it it's different so then I could tell
[1:16:50] where it was cut but I couldn't see just
[1:16:53] where the man was and after a while so
[1:16:56] he in the spirit know after what I found
[1:16:58] it
[1:16:58] I seen what it was i watch the darkness
[1:17:01] haggle over him say see in watching
[1:17:03] normal people and he's looking he's
[1:17:04] courting me wonderful where that man is
[1:17:05] what what you different level here now
[1:17:10] looking for Tennessee doctors hanging

[1:17:14] spirit know that you do t have that this
[1:17:16] happen over Neely let's continue and I
[1:17:22] didn't want to say that but just turn
[1:17:23] around payments it child of the devil
[1:17:25] see why he has the devil put in your
[1:17:27] mind to do that because he's done that
[1:17:29] something was saying it to me they will
[1:17:31] be over here and he is still paralyzed
[1:17:38] still paralyzed letter after letter come
[1:17:43] to him I said the only thing I know is
[1:17:44] repent see I had never did that
[1:17:46] that was your ereference before god no
[1:17:49] don't you do that
[1:17:50] oh my hallelujah praise God now we come
[1:17:53] times that people think that this
[1:17:55] holiness before God is some kind of
[1:17:58] mockery or some kind of bunch of people
[1:18:00] that doesn't know some kind of cult or
[1:18:02] plan but let me assure you brother there
[1:18:04] may be a lot of mockery I don't see that
[1:18:06] isn't I can't say that I'm just a man I
[1:18:08] ain't no judge I just come to preach but
[1:18:10] there's a genuine Holy Spirit they are
[1:18:12] genuine a Pacific Paul the Holy Spirit
[1:18:15] and in foreign countries witch doctors
[1:18:17] and things rise up them Devils the
[1:18:18] challenge if I'll break my subject here
[1:18:20] that could I tell you about those things
[1:18:22] I've seen on an Holy Spirit never one
[1:18:24] time fall into a praise God no they put
[1:18:27] for the wings humility we and we don't
[1:18:30] like the bow ourselves we want to think
[1:18:32] we are somebody nobody want to humble
[1:18:34] themselves everybody wants to keep this
[1:18:36] self you know I am this I am that nobody
[1:18:39] want to say I'm sorry I'm wrong I missed
[1:18:41] a turn I need to get back on track this
[1:18:44] is what God wants the thing of it is
[1:18:46] people brother sister and friends it's
[1:18:49] the be conscious of your littleness
[1:18:52] don't be conscious of how big you are
[1:18:56] because just hold it you are you are
[1:18:59] small we are all that we God can do
[1:19:02] without us but we can't do it on him all
[1:19:05] glory to God God isn't trying to find
[1:19:07] one person he can get in his hands you
[1:19:09] always try to do that unit is all along
[1:19:11] to the Bible he just got to give you
[1:19:13] just got to give you all to God your
[1:19:14] reference your respect everything you
[1:19:16] are just be nothing and Co little you
[1:19:19] can
[1:19:19] and what God wants to do first that's
[1:19:21] real humility that's the way the surfing
[1:19:23] zionist presence you see their thesis
[1:19:25] reference the feature members you know
[1:19:27] terribly they could fly there are two
[1:19:28] wings and that put them in action God is
[1:19:30] showing his profit here
[1:19:31] what kind of servant he has prepared
[1:19:33] reverent humble and in action that's the
[1:19:38] real servant that God is looking for Oh
[1:19:41] hallelujah
[1:19:42] oh my own home stretch you know since
[1:19:46] John 14 2000 fathers worshiped in this
[1:19:48] mountain and you say that the New
[1:19:50] Jerusalem is a place that men ought to
[1:19:51] worship this is a woman at the well
[1:19:53] talking to Jesus and Jesus said woman
[1:19:54] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[1:19:56] neither in this mountain nor yet to
[1:19:58] Jerusalem we should the father you
[1:19:59] worship you know that what we know what
[1:20:01] we worship for salvation of the Jews but
[1:20:03] I our commander now is when the true
[1:20:05] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:20:06] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:20:08] seeketh such to worship Him no we
[1:20:10] couldn't do that why because the truth
[1:20:12] was lost to seven ages so course send
[1:20:14] the Angels to Cana all these scattered
[1:20:16] word the tide back in the world to bring
[1:20:19] along the Holy Ghost that's what the
[1:20:20] seven seas was all about Dakara all over
[1:20:22] to bring down the Holy Spirit that we
[1:20:24] could have mechanics and dynamics we
[1:20:26] could have word and spirit but we can
[1:20:28] correctly worship God no we have the
[1:20:30] truth we need a spirit to have the word
[1:20:32] truth and spirit word and spirit
[1:20:35] hallelujah the father seeketh such or
[1:20:38] give the Lord I show you meaning this
[1:20:40] message Almighty God looking for two
[1:20:42] worshipers or glory to God hallelujah
[1:20:45] brother branham mechanics in what runs
[1:20:48] the automobile is the dynamics of
[1:20:49] run-ins the mechanics don't run the
[1:20:51] church is the dynamics the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] that gets into this world it is not
[1:20:56] seminary that teaches you all the
[1:20:57] theology and Greek interpretations but
[1:20:59] it's the dynamics of the Holy Ghost in
[1:21:02] there to set that afire and bring it to
[1:21:04] pass and to make it live exactly what
[1:21:07] the promise Wofford is are not the
[1:21:09] mechanics the dynamics it takes the
[1:21:11] mechanics and dynamics the word of the
[1:21:14] Spirit they are the one that gives life
[1:21:16] or glory to God what God promised for
[1:21:19] this hour look for it to be fulfilled
[1:21:21] what what God promised you after know
[1:21:25] what God promised don't look for it to
[1:21:27] be fulfilled
[1:21:29] you can't expect what you feel to be
[1:21:31] fulfilled it's what God promised if God
[1:21:33] promised a seventh on the revival just
[1:21:35] one marries ival not seventh under
[1:21:37] talked seventh on the revival Oh glory
[1:21:40] to God hallelujah sorry the cornea and
[1:21:43] let's continue until the church becomes
[1:21:47] what mechanics and dynamics and the
[1:21:50] Spirit of God that moved him do the same
[1:21:52] things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders
[1:21:55] sober the bride for he said in Saint
[1:21:57] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[1:21:59] works that I do shall you do also I will
[1:22:01] give him a charge of my dynamics in his
[1:22:04] mechanics and the world will not be able
[1:22:07] to withstand it you hear about the
[1:22:10] clients we become cross mechanics I'm
[1:22:13] caught bring a charge it have you let
[1:22:20] your cars right no yeah the plug is in
[1:22:21] look at that charge way to go if you
[1:22:24] don't plug it in you have nowhere to go
[1:22:25] you have a whole night
[1:22:27] you take a brand new and it's not
[1:22:28] charged up you only person taking
[1:22:30] pictures you will go nowhere when you
[1:22:33] plug it in anger be charged then your
[1:22:35] car could go right this bride she's
[1:22:38] mechanics and dynamics is the charge
[1:22:40] I mean longer you stay anymore chat on
[1:22:43] your battery or glory that God God and
[1:22:46] charge up the brake battery we want to
[1:22:48] leave you and smoke him smoke in the
[1:22:50] devil's face or glowing avoid smoking
[1:22:54] hallelujah smoke coming from the bride
[1:22:56] never get confused because of pride
[1:22:59] leaving your Shelton or give the Lord of
[1:23:01] princes people it will only work watch
[1:23:04] watch watch watch
[1:23:06] that's the Easter message mechanics and
[1:23:08] dynamics together the mechanics with all
[1:23:10] dynamics no good neither is dynamic soil
[1:23:12] mechanics you can scream and shout and
[1:23:14] jump up and down all you want and the
[1:23:16] 90s word you will do no good you're
[1:23:18] cranking along the Pistons it will only
[1:23:20] work as they come together so one will
[1:23:22] set still and the other one will go up
[1:23:24] Oh glory to God that's the only thing
[1:23:26] there is to it they might look like both
[1:23:29] came to be churches both tend to be
[1:23:30] bright but one has mechanics
[1:23:33] Oh glory to God is that your expectation
[1:23:35] tonight to see a church with mechanical
[1:23:38] dynamics or glory level it won't move no
[1:23:41] matter how good the mechanics is until
[1:23:43] dynamics come and when the dynamics come
[1:23:45] that fire is mythical equity octane in
[1:23:48] the gasoline and when that explored it
[1:23:51] caused a combustion and that combustion
[1:23:53] moves every motion every move for he the
[1:23:55] same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:57] that is the resurrection that is the
[1:23:59] real power of God mechanics and dynamics
[1:24:01] it is the spirit of quick left Oh glory
[1:24:04] to God hallelujah
[1:24:06] and look all the profit time dynamics
[1:24:08] and mechanics with worship and earnest
[1:24:10] love this almost on the home stretch yet
[1:24:11] Romans 8:11 if the spirit had raised
[1:24:14] christ on the dead being you it will
[1:24:16] quicken your mortal bodies if the split
[1:24:17] and really is on the dead it will be in
[1:24:19] you and we're cooking on water bodies
[1:24:21] quicken it what does the word quick
[1:24:22] means it means to be brought to life
[1:24:24] after death and there is the gift of
[1:24:26] worship worship in spirit and in truth
[1:24:29] mechanics and dynamics together so
[1:24:32] genuine worship comes when we have
[1:24:34] mechanics and dynamics together almost
[1:24:38] done Gideon comedy piano hallelujah or
[1:24:41] glory to God or glory to God hallelujah
[1:24:45] or you enjoy the word tonight as Daniel
[1:24:49] the seven thunders and forbidden to
[1:24:51] write John heard the voices and this
[1:24:53] book was sealed and the back of the book
[1:24:55] receiver seven seals but in the days of
[1:24:57] these scenes will be open listen the
[1:24:59] mystery of gotta be finished in other
[1:25:01] words God would be known to his church
[1:25:04] not in three people but as one person
[1:25:07] the mystery of God would reveal and when
[1:25:10] that was completely revealed remember
[1:25:13] what we said some couple of semester
[1:25:14] back we have been living in a time of
[1:25:17] the revelation of these things being
[1:25:20] made known but after the time of the
[1:25:23] revelation of these and be made known
[1:25:24] God gonna come to dynamics to bring the
[1:25:27] manifestation of the things that have
[1:25:29] been made known Oh glory to God so watch
[1:25:32] now he said God will be known to his
[1:25:34] church not in three people but as one
[1:25:36] person the mystery of God revealed and
[1:25:39] when that was completely revealed then
[1:25:41] the seven mysteries would open to the
[1:25:43] church because in
[1:25:45] yeah we go the church would be living
[1:25:49] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:53] him moving in and out among us show any
[1:25:57] signs of being alive living among us and
[1:25:59] them we are worshiping the Living Christ
[1:26:02] that's a mirage that is what you have to
[1:26:06] look for him moving in and out the Holy
[1:26:09] Spirit
[1:26:10] Oh glory to God last coat and I'm done
