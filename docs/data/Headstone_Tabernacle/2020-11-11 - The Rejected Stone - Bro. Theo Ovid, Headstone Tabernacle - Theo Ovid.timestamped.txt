[29:32] like to read isaiah
[29:34] chapter 28. we want to read from verse 5
[29:37] to 22.
[29:38] we also want to read from acts chapter 4
[29:42] i want to read 1-21
[29:46] reading from isaiah chapter
[29:51] 28 verse 5
[29:56] in that day shall the lord of hosts be
[29:59] for a crown of glory and for a diadem of
[30:03] beauty
[30:04] unto the residue of his people and for a
[30:08] spirit of judgment to him that sitted in
[30:10] judgment
[30:11] and for strength to them that turn the
[30:13] battle to the gate
[30:15] but they have also have heard through
[30:18] wine and through strong drinker out of
[30:21] the way
[30:22] the priest and the prophet have heard
[30:26] too strong drink they are swallowed up
[30:30] of
[30:30] wine they are out of the way through
[30:32] strong drink they er
[30:35] envision they stumble
[30:38] in judgment for all tables are full of
[30:40] vomit and filthiness so
[30:43] that there is no place clean whom shall
[30:46] he teach
[30:46] knowledge and whom shall he make
[30:49] to understand doctrine them that are
[30:52] weaned from the milk
[30:53] and drawn from the breast for precept
[30:57] must be upon precept
[30:59] piece upon precept line up online
[31:02] line up online here a little dear little
[31:04] for his tamarind lips another tongue
[31:07] will he speak to this people to whom he
[31:09] said
[31:10] this is the rest rarity may cause the
[31:14] weary to rest and this is the
[31:15] refreshing yet they would not hear
[31:19] but the word of the lord was unto them
[31:22] precept upon precept
[31:24] precept upon precept line upon line line
[31:27] upon line here little dear little
[31:29] that they might go and fall backward
[31:33] and be broken and sneered
[31:36] and taken wherefore
[31:40] hear the word of the lord these countful
[31:42] men that rule this
[31:43] people which in jew is in jerusalem
[31:46] because you have said we have made a
[31:49] covenant with debt
[31:50] and with hell are we at agreement when
[31:53] the overflowing squad shall pass through
[31:56] it shall not come unto us for we have
[31:59] made lies
[32:00] our refuge and under falsehood have we
[32:02] hid ourselves
[32:03] therefore thus saith the lord god
[32:07] behold zion for foundation a stone
[32:11] a tried stone a precious corner stone
[32:14] a sure foundation he that believeth
[32:17] shall not make haste
[32:19] judgment also will i lay to the line
[32:22] unrighteousness to the plummet and the
[32:24] heel
[32:24] shall sweep away the refuge of lies and
[32:28] the water shall
[32:29] overflow the hidden place and your
[32:32] covenant with death shall be dishonored
[32:35] and your agreement with hell shall not
[32:37] stand
[32:38] when the overflowing scourge shall pass
[32:41] through then he shall be trotted on by
[32:42] it
[32:43] from the time that is going forth it
[32:45] shall take you
[32:47] for morning by morning shall it pass
[32:49] over by day
[32:50] and by night and it shall be a vexation
[32:52] only to
[32:53] understand the report for the bed is
[32:56] shorter than a man can stretch himself
[32:58] on it
[32:59] and the covering narrower than that he
[33:00] can wrap himself in it
[33:02] for the lord shall rise up as in mong
[33:05] perism
[33:06] he shall be wrought as in the valley of
[33:08] gibeon that he may do his work
[33:11] his strange work and bring to pass his
[33:13] act
[33:14] his stranger now therefore
[33:18] be not mockers least your hands be made
[33:21] strong for i have heard from the lord
[33:24] god of hosts
[33:26] a consumption even determined upon the
[33:29] whole earth
[33:31] in acts chapter 4 and this is after
[33:35] the layman walked through the power of
[33:38] god flowing through peter
[33:41] and this is uh chapter four verse one
[33:43] another they spake unto the people the
[33:45] priest
[33:46] the captain of the temple the sadducees
[33:48] came upon them
[33:49] being grieved that they taught the
[33:51] people and preached
[33:53] through jesus the resurrection from the
[33:55] dead
[33:56] and to lay hands on them and put them in
[33:58] whole for the next day
[34:00] for it was now evening time how be it
[34:02] many of them which heard a word believed
[34:05] and the number of men was about five
[34:07] thousand
[34:09] and it came to pass on the moral that
[34:11] the rulers and elders and scribes and
[34:13] annas the high priest
[34:15] and kaiphus and john and alexander and
[34:18] as many as of the kindred of the high
[34:20] priest
[34:20] were gathered together jerusalem when
[34:23] they had set them in the midst
[34:24] they asked by what power or by what name
[34:27] have you done this
[34:29] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[34:32] said unto them he rulers of
[34:34] the people and elders of israel if we
[34:38] this day be examined of the good deed
[34:40] done to this impotent man by what means
[34:44] he is made whole be it known unto you
[34:45] all and to all the people of israel
[34:48] that by the name of jesus christ of
[34:50] nazareth
[34:51] whom he crucified whom god raised from
[34:53] the dead even by him
[34:55] that this man stand here before you
[34:57] whole this
[34:58] is the stone which was set at note of
[35:01] you builders
[35:02] which has become the head of the corner
[35:04] neither is there salvation in any other
[35:06] for there is none other name among
[35:08] heaven given among men
[35:10] whereby we must be saved now when they
[35:12] saw the boldness of peter and john
[35:15] and perceived that they were unlearned
[35:17] and ignorant
[35:18] men they marveled and they took
[35:21] knowledge
[35:22] of them that they have been with jesus
[35:24] and behold in the man which was healed
[35:26] standing with them
[35:27] they could see nothing against it but
[35:30] when they had commanded them to go aside
[35:33] out of the council
[35:34] they conferred among themselves saying
[35:36] what shall we do to these men
[35:38] for that indeed is a notable miracle had
[35:41] been done by them is manifest to all of
[35:43] them that dwell in jerusalem and we
[35:45] cannot deny it
[35:46] but that it spread to unfold among the
[35:48] people let us straightly threaten them
[35:51] that they speak henceforth to no man in
[35:54] this name
[35:56] they call them and commanded them not to
[35:58] speak
[35:59] at all or teach in the name of jesus
[36:02] but peter and john answered and said
[36:04] unto them
[36:06] whether it be right in the sight of god
[36:09] to hack unto you
[36:10] more than under god judgey for we cannot
[36:13] but speak the things which we have seen
[36:16] and heard
[36:17] so when they had further threatened them
[36:19] they let them go
[36:20] finding nothing how they might punish
[36:22] them because of the people
[36:24] for all men glorify god for that which
[36:28] was done that's about his father we
[36:29] thank you
[36:30] for your word tonight interpreted to us
[36:32] lord take me out of the way and speak
[36:34] liberty to your people
[36:35] in jesus name i ask it amen you may be
[36:37] seated o praise the name of the lord uh
[36:42] that scripture we read the first
[36:44] scripture from isaiah
[36:46] that verse 22 now therefore be muckers
[36:49] at least your hands be made strong
[36:51] for i have heard the lord god of hosts
[36:55] a consumption even determined upon the
[36:58] whole earth
[36:59] and the amplifier that reads now
[37:01] therefore do not be scuffers
[37:03] least the bands which bind you be made
[37:06] strong
[37:07] for a decree of destruction
[37:11] have i heard from the lord of hosts upon
[37:13] the whole land
[37:15] and upon the whole earth a decree of
[37:17] destruction tonight
[37:18] our title the rejected stone have
[37:21] inspiration
[37:22] the spirit of christ operating in our
[37:24] bodies
[37:25] that's a title the spirit of christ
[37:26] operating in our bodies
[37:29] now we know the prophet prophesied a
[37:32] woman would be in power
[37:33] president or vice president before the
[37:35] annihilation
[37:37] or or destruction this was prophesied by
[37:40] vision
[37:41] since 1933 ms also said maybe the
[37:44] catholic church
[37:45] he also said this woman would be cruel
[37:47] in heart
[37:48] now we know with the election as it goes
[37:51] as far as we know um
[37:53] with kamala harris and joel biden we
[37:56] know
[37:57] that uh november 11th
[38:00] praise god when the war was stopped by
[38:02] the four angels of revelation
[38:04] seven standing at the four corners of
[38:06] the earth it was holding back
[38:09] the destruction holding back things
[38:12] until deceiving angel could come from
[38:14] the east to seal
[38:16] the 144 000 jews and before
[38:19] the ceiling angel reached them he has to
[38:21] reach the gentiles
[38:23] to close off the gentiles dispensations
[38:26] so your ceiling is guaranteed the cap
[38:29] coming to you is guaranteed
[38:32] praise the lord amen it's very
[38:34] interesting
[38:35] that uh
[38:38] this calling madame harris or vice
[38:41] president-elect
[38:42] has broken the ceiling for women in high
[38:44] office being the first one
[38:47] so the congdon the destruction is on
[38:50] a decree of destruction it's interesting
[38:53] what she said her mother told her
[38:56] her mother told her she said that she
[38:57] will be the first in many things
[38:59] but don't be the last and she yourself
[39:02] said i may be the first woman
[39:04] to be in this position but i am not
[39:06] going to be the last
[39:07] so that is very interesting you know
[39:10] when god
[39:11] promised this deliverer to come in
[39:13] genesis
[39:14] it took three stages actually higa
[39:18] sarah and then mary and then the christ
[39:22] so we are seeing the beginning of a new
[39:24] season a new time
[39:26] breaking upon us isn't that right now
[39:29] 1914 the world went to war
[39:31] they have never been on peace since
[39:33] constantly swinging this is the prophet
[39:35] swinging
[39:36] they are doing the very same thing yet
[39:37] and what was they doing
[39:39] holding he said oh god have mercy hole
[39:40] holding that great thing that i saw
[39:43] in the vision the whole thing becomes
[39:45] the destruction
[39:46] holding the atomic holding the wars that
[39:49] they don't destroy themselves until
[39:51] the thing come to destroy it until
[39:53] israel returns back and gets itself
[39:54] together
[39:55] and then the message will go to israel
[39:57] and she'll be sealed
[39:58] with the seal of the holy ghost which is
[40:00] what are we talking about
[40:01] for the uh what do you call it the long
[40:03] pentecostal feast
[40:05] oh hallelujah the long time of pentecost
[40:08] oh glory to god that covers seven
[40:10] churches
[40:12] oh glory to god do you believe that
[40:13] hallelujah and then the messiah will go
[40:15] to israel
[40:16] and she'll be sealed with the seed of
[40:18] the holy ghost see
[40:19] after the gentiles is called out the
[40:21] people for his namesake will be called
[40:23] out
[40:23] which in this age right here their call
[40:26] and
[40:27] israel receives a three-year and
[40:29] six-month
[40:30] message hallelujah
[40:34] all right so let's go tonight
[40:37] praise god he said now we come here this
[40:40] morning to gather hopes new hopes of
[40:42] what we
[40:43] are here for and what is the purpose
[40:46] and i think this is a wonderful time to
[40:47] think on the hopes that god has given us
[40:50] now we want to draw this first into our
[40:52] mind that there is not
[40:53] one thing that can destroy us until the
[40:57] purpose
[40:58] of he who created us has been fulfilled
[41:01] so you'd rather be worried and fearful
[41:03] and destruction and no
[41:05] no no no you're the capital you have to
[41:06] study the purpose
[41:08] that you are here for remember the jewel
[41:11] there is no we are made for purpose this
[41:14] church was
[41:15] built here for a purpose this foundation
[41:17] was not dug and the cornerstone laid and
[41:19] the blocks laid in the building and the
[41:21] roof on the interior was not put yet
[41:23] just to be seen
[41:24] it could be done it was put here by a
[41:26] purpose
[41:27] your home that you live in is not just
[41:29] accidentally put there and somebody just
[41:31] wasting some time
[41:32] your home was made for a purpose to
[41:34] serve a purpose
[41:35] you didn't drive here tonight with your
[41:37] automobile that automobile
[41:38] not made to see if it could be made the
[41:40] materials was not wasted by man
[41:42] it was put you for a purpose to serve a
[41:45] purpose the clothing you wear was not
[41:47] just to see somebody could fashion
[41:48] something
[41:49] it was our purpose the food you eat was
[41:51] not grown on earth just to see it grow
[41:53] it was made to silver purpose
[41:54] and god did not have to make just a tree
[41:57] just to be a tree he made a tree for a
[41:58] purpose
[41:59] and god did not make you and i just to
[42:01] see if he could do it
[42:02] he made us for a purpose therefore there
[42:05] is a purpose of us
[42:06] all being here you are not here just to
[42:08] be another human being
[42:10] you are here because god made you for
[42:13] some purpose
[42:14] you are not here just to eat food that
[42:16] god growed
[42:17] you are not here just to live in a house
[42:19] that man made
[42:20] or to wear the clothing that someone
[42:22] fashioned you are here for a specific
[42:24] purpose
[42:25] and no matter how little you are or how
[42:28] big you are
[42:28] how important you are how unimportant
[42:31] you are
[42:32] you are here to serve that purpose oh
[42:35] glory to god
[42:36] just as my fingers here for purpose the
[42:38] nail on my fingers for our purpose my
[42:40] eye
[42:41] every part of our bodies is a silver
[42:43] purpose it was not put here
[42:45] just to see it could be look what it put
[42:47] here but it was put here to service
[42:48] purpose
[42:49] it was god's divine plan to do so and if
[42:52] we are here
[42:53] put on god's purpose there is nothing
[42:55] can destroy us
[42:56] until god's purpose be fulfilled nothing
[42:59] can harm us
[43:00] until that purpose that god has put us
[43:02] here for has been made
[43:04] manifest no matter how much trouble we
[43:06] have how much heartaches and sorrows
[43:08] we go through all these things have a
[43:10] reason and there's a reason for it we'll
[43:12] give the lord some praises
[43:14] oh glory to god your life is no mistake
[43:17] your life is no accident your life is
[43:20] for our purpose
[43:21] oh god the hell you have been through is
[43:23] for our purpose the disappointments
[43:25] the heartaches the sorrows it's for our
[43:28] purpose
[43:28] but we know in romans 8 28 that all
[43:31] things will work together for good
[43:33] to them that love god to them what he
[43:35] called according to his
[43:38] purpose
[43:41] in the time of solomon he said they
[43:43] floated
[43:45] the cedars far from chopper hall them
[43:48] and the ox cat
[43:49] they cut all these stones around the
[43:51] world and when they come together it was
[43:53] such
[43:54] perfect missionary in 40 years
[43:57] building of the temple there wasn't a
[43:59] buzz of a saw
[44:00] of a song of a hammer every stone went
[44:03] one was cut this way
[44:05] one was cut that way one was cut back
[44:08] this way
[44:08] but every one of them went together no
[44:11] man could come and cut the bride
[44:13] oh and say i had to look like this one i
[44:15] have to preach like this one
[44:17] i have to teach like this one i have to
[44:18] follow this one that's nonsense
[44:21] when god will cut him he do the cutting
[44:23] and then he going to arrange and fit the
[44:24] stones together
[44:25] or give the lord some praises isn't that
[44:28] right that's to build the temple of god
[44:30] so watch every stone when one was cut
[44:32] this way that way they started laying
[44:34] the thing
[44:34] putting the building up and getting
[44:36] along fine and they found a funny
[44:38] looking stone
[44:39] and they didn't want that thing they
[44:40] said that that don't belong here
[44:42] they kicked it out show it in a weed
[44:44] pile come to find out
[44:46] they built on and on and on i come to
[44:48] find out the very stone they had
[44:50] rejected
[44:51] was the chief cornerstone and jesus said
[44:54] so
[44:54] and today the methodists the baptists
[44:56] the lutherans the pentecostal everywhere
[44:58] wrong
[44:58] if you want to watch our friends the
[45:00] real cornerstone you are rejecting it
[45:03] and the cornerstone in the building of
[45:05] this spiritual house
[45:06] is the holy spirit you're afraid of it
[45:10] you're afraid of fanaticism i know we
[45:13] have a lot of scarecrows and mockery why
[45:15] if there wasn't that it wouldn't be the
[45:17] real one but there's a
[45:19] genuine article of the holy spirit in
[45:22] baptism we'll give the lord some praises
[45:23] tonight
[45:24] and that's the way it's going to be in
[45:26] the coming of the lord jesus pure
[45:28] heart pure in heart shall see god and
[45:30] the reason
[45:31] we builders are not getting anywhere the
[45:33] same way they did back here
[45:35] the chief cornerstone was rejected
[45:38] and that's the matter today with the
[45:39] methodist and the baptist and the
[45:41] pentecostal all the chief cornerstone
[45:43] which is jesus christ is rejected we
[45:44] have all our theology and things
[45:47] we speak of this what our church
[45:49] believes
[45:50] what our watchers don't believe we teach
[45:52] it in
[45:53] pump it in everything like that but the
[45:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[45:56] and the power of god to let freedom in
[46:00] amongst the people is rejected
[46:03] i want to read that part again he said
[46:05] what we
[46:06] we we could teach our teletheology what
[46:09] our church don't believe what
[46:10] what we believe we teach it pump it in
[46:12] everything like that but the baptism of
[46:14] the holy ghost and the power of god
[46:16] to let the freedom in among the people
[46:18] you know why the ministers don't want
[46:19] the spirit
[46:20] because it takes power from them
[46:23] that is why they don't want the spirit
[46:25] because when the spirit comes
[46:26] they lose power because the spirit does
[46:30] take over
[46:31] they can't do their own thing and play
[46:32] politics behind the pulpit
[46:34] and preach this and slam this one and
[46:36] blast just wanna do this and do this
[46:38] because they're doing it
[46:39] that's not the spirit doing it
[46:41] hallelujah peter told that ana zafara
[46:43] you didn't lie to me you liked the holy
[46:45] ghost
[46:45] wasn't peter doing something and trying
[46:47] something he was the spirit was there
[46:50] the fire was there the power is there oh
[46:53] glory to god hallelujah
[46:55] so this is what it does but the baptism
[46:57] of the holy ghost and the power of god
[46:59] to let what
[47:00] freedom in amongst the people so what
[47:02] the ministers do to bind the people to
[47:04] themselves by fear
[47:06] oh glory to god that's the binding power
[47:08] that is you know yeah the preacher with
[47:10] the power the power of fear
[47:12] not the power of the holy ghost the
[47:13] power of fear so the people are born
[47:15] but a jubilee time coming for all who
[47:17] want to go free
[47:19] in the jubilee oh glory to god so watch
[47:22] and that's the very cornerstone that
[47:24] build the church that will go home
[47:26] to meet jesus the cornerstone was kicked
[47:29] out in a bunch of ways they built their
[47:31] church they built their church
[47:33] come to find out the place where they
[47:34] left undone the cornerstone fit right
[47:37] into it and today where all the power
[47:39] signs and wonders is being left undone
[47:41] you find out the holy ghost fits right
[47:42] in there for he
[47:44] is the one who brings the power of god
[47:47] into the church
[47:48] who is the one he is the one that's why
[47:49] a minister can bring a revival
[47:51] it takes the holy ghost to bring a
[47:52] revival oh glory to god the stone
[47:55] that has been rejected as the chief
[47:56] cornerstone you builders of these
[47:58] denominations remember that
[48:00] the rejected stone is the chief
[48:01] cornerstone and brother say he is here
[48:03] tonight

[48:06] that he is present

[51:47] you remember when the servants of the
[51:48] bible say the lord delay is coming
[51:50] that's why they can fight one that was
[51:52] the
[51:53] revolution that they have but the true
[51:55] church all over the world
[51:56] has shipped down to a place that there's
[51:59] come
[52:00] a ministry among it just exactly like
[52:03] the ministry of jesus christ
[52:06] see this is what is coming along too the
[52:09] true church has to have this ministry
[52:11] in it smith now watch what they got
[52:15] here what they got what they got they
[52:16] got their thing in condition now what's
[52:18] the next thing the rejected stone
[52:20] of the pyramid cut out of the mountain
[52:23] without hands
[52:24] god centered do you see the rejected one
[52:27] the rejected stone is the head of this
[52:30] is the head is the capstone and the very
[52:34] one that they rejected through the
[52:35] gentle age is christ
[52:37] and christ was not cut and put there as
[52:39] a vicar
[52:40] or son of god or some great dignitary in
[52:42] the church he is
[52:43] the holy spirit and the cap of the
[52:46] pyramid will be christ coming
[52:48] do you see it so on top of brotherly
[52:50] kindness is what
[52:52] holy spirit and then afterwards is
[52:54] christ's corporal body they kept coming
[52:56] but the holy spirit is christ coming to
[52:59] you
[53:00] to see the pyramid of your life yeah he
[53:03] is
[53:03] this is him to be daniel christ is that
[53:06] stone
[53:06] he wasn't born of man he was born of god
[53:09] he's coming for a church that has been
[53:11] reborn again by the spirit of god
[53:14] because the strength of that headstone
[53:18] runs through the church like a magnet
[53:21] and was shaping up all these things and
[53:22] all these scrap playing there
[53:24] and they you talk about the place where
[53:25] and they swept out and a big stone come
[53:28] and picked it up and all that big magnet
[53:31] stone that pick up all of it because it
[53:32] was magnificent
[53:33] more than a company some place where
[53:35] they have all this crap metal and the
[53:36] big magnet come and pick up all the
[53:38] metals and so on like that
[53:39] he said because it was magnetized and we
[53:42] have got to be magnetized to that
[53:44] headstone
[53:45] not magnetized to the pasta not
[53:48] magnetized pancakes to the preacher
[53:51] magnetized the headstone which is the
[53:53] holy spirit
[53:54] which is christ
[54:00] hallelujah
[54:03] so to watch the headstone is the holy
[54:05] spirit and every one of us that got the
[54:07] magnetism of the holy spirit when the
[54:10] stone
[54:12] that daniel saw caught the hands of man
[54:14] strikes the image the church would fleet
[54:16] it back into glory
[54:17] she'd be taken up the rapture of the
[54:19] saints
[54:21] so how could somebody go with all the
[54:22] magnetism of the holy ghost
[54:24] the head high with knowledge and
[54:26] mysteries and revelation and information
[54:27] and whatnot
[54:28] and they do have the magnetism of the
[54:30] holy ghost
[54:32] oh my lovely culture you have to have
[54:33] the evidence of that
[54:35] let me say it again not just claiming
[54:37] that you know you have to have the
[54:38] evidence of that you know
[54:40] peter didn't just claim it you know he
[54:41] said silvan go i don't have
[54:43] but i have something and what i have i
[54:46] can give
[54:46] and he release it and the man walked and
[54:49] that shook up whole
[54:51] the testimony of a resurrected christ in
[54:53] their midst was bringing people to the
[54:55] lord
[54:56] and we have very read five thousand came
[54:58] to serve the lord
[55:00] this chief priest and the pharisees that
[55:02] were forming the council to bring press
[55:04] upon them not because they have a book
[55:07] and they're talking about jesus
[55:08] but because the man walked and the
[55:10] miracle could not be denied
[55:12] oh give the lord a shout no pressure
[55:14] coming because we have books and tapes
[55:16] no pressure coming because we're
[55:17] teaching this and teaching have endless
[55:19] teachings all over the world
[55:20] the press will come when christ the
[55:23] rejected stone
[55:24] is being made manifest he said this is
[55:26] the stone that was set at north at you
[55:28] builders
[55:29] this is the stone that the billy refused
[55:32] he is quoting
[55:33] praise god psalms 1 18 the stone that
[55:36] the bill reveals
[55:37] has become the head stone of the corner
[55:39] they knew those guys was ignorant and
[55:41] alone
[55:41] but the spirit would bring back king to
[55:43] their memory he will lead them to all
[55:45] truths and guide them
[55:46] they were ignorant learned but the
[55:48] spirit knows the word
[55:50] and the words that's coming up oh glory
[55:53] to god
[55:54] so we're in the homeland the jews are in
[55:56] the homeland

[55:59] the rapture the rapture comes the church
[56:01] goes up
[56:02] we are caught up to meet him in the air
[56:04] oh praise the lord
[56:05] and the stone was cut out of the
[56:07] mountains ready to come at any time
[56:09] when it comes what does it do it does
[56:10] away with the gentile age
[56:12] so the coming of the stone comes off
[56:14] this entire dispensation
[56:29] and debt mourning my morning with
[56:31] terrorism

[56:34] do his mysterious work

[56:55] when that stone come what does it do
[56:57] it does away with the gentile age it's

[57:22] pastor your father is the elder your
[57:24] father is a deacon he takes the church

[57:29] the church the holy ghost filled
[57:30] go give the lord some praises tonight
[57:34] i'm still reading what's the filthy

[57:42] virgin is filthy
[57:44] yes he said he's that that does he
[57:46] filthy
[57:48] oh hallelujah we'll get out and so on
[57:50] like that
[57:51] i'll skip that now if you have been in
[57:53] egypt you will know the great pyramid in
[57:55] egypt
[57:55] you all speak about so much he said now
[57:58] watch
[57:58] uh the stones were put up there together
[58:01] the cap there would
[58:02] have to have a perfect stone or he said
[58:04] they'd have a symbol of prophecy
[58:06] then they had someone rejected just like
[58:08] the chief cornerstone the bible was
[58:10] rejected now
[58:11] we're getting closer and closer and the
[58:13] spirit of god here we go
[58:15] has come from justification
[58:17] sanctification
[58:19] baptism of the holy ghost that church
[58:22] will have to be so close and the spirit
[58:25] of god
[58:25] so perfect working in that church
[58:29] wow when the headstone comes it will
[58:33] cap together and the resurrection will
[58:35] come and away will go to church
[58:37] now you say that's just here say but i'm
[58:40] trying to
[58:40] show you a point that the church
[58:43] has to come to a place to have the
[58:46] spirit of christ
[58:47] in it the spirit of christ operating
[58:51] in our bodies just like it operated in
[58:54] the body of our lord
[58:56] i'm not hearing you tonight oh give the
[58:58] lord a shout
[59:00] or you on the internet yet give the lord
[59:02] a shout
[59:03] this is this is target tonight we are
[59:05] missing tonight at all this is dead on
[59:07] target
[59:07] oh this is not nice you know no no no no
[59:11] no
[59:11] no no no i'm trying to show you a point
[59:14] that the church has got to come to a
[59:17] place
[59:18] to have the spirit of christ in other
[59:20] words after they add up all these songs
[59:22] after he had mysteries and revelations
[59:24] and inspiration it's equal sign
[59:26] you have to be the spirit of christ
[59:27] operate the total
[59:29] you dance here your dad your flip here i
[59:32] call that verbal
[59:33] gymnastics you flip it here you flip it
[59:36] here you twist it here
[59:37] you stretch it over three hours here you
[59:39] still have more to say here
[59:40] at the end of it it has to equal the
[59:43] spirit of christ
[59:44] operating in the church the spirit of
[59:48] operating our bodies just like
[59:52] that's the operating word
[59:55] no no claim christ openly understands
[59:58] you're talking
[1:00:09] 50 years gone he's still opening
[1:00:15] leave it open all that opening
[1:00:17] understanding opening your mind opening
[1:00:20] you're the word all that opening is on
[1:00:22] top purpose
[1:00:24] just like we read everything is our
[1:00:25] purpose that understanding is to know
[1:00:28] wide in the upper room because if they
[1:00:30] don't understand by revelation why
[1:00:32] afterwards some people led they'll leave
[1:00:34] their problem until they won't get coke
[1:00:35] and get drink
[1:00:37] and they go missing their pentecost and
[1:00:38] when somebody breathe and move
[1:00:40] everybody follow them too like peter we
[1:00:42] go fishing i go fishing all them go
[1:00:44] following peter too
[1:00:45] so the word doing that for them they
[1:00:47] can't move
[1:00:48] they nail in the upper room this they're
[1:00:51] stuck there
[1:00:52] they have to carry until they don't even
[1:00:55] know when he's coming
[1:00:56] they don't know when the revival will
[1:00:58] break him it could break tonight
[1:00:59] you just have to wait until we don't
[1:01:01] know we've been walking into
[1:01:03] something supernatural tonight that will
[1:01:05] change the course of any everything
[1:01:08] oh glory to god you don't know oh
[1:01:10] hallelujah
[1:01:11] they have to wait until because he told
[1:01:14] them tarry and the jerusalem until
[1:01:17] no glory there god will nobody talk you
[1:01:18] out there until
[1:01:20] you want it now you want it now you
[1:01:21] gotta wait
[1:01:23] until because the vision is always
[1:01:26] for an appointed time we'll give the
[1:01:28] lord some praises
[1:01:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:32] i think i want to read this thing again
[1:01:34] this thing was so sweet tonight i'm
[1:01:35] trying to show you a point
[1:01:37] that the church has got to come to a
[1:01:39] place to have the spirit
[1:01:43] of christ in it the spirit of christ
[1:01:46] operating in our bodies
[1:01:51] so he's not talking about the anointing
[1:01:52] or church
[1:01:55] operating in our bodies in other words
[1:01:57] the word made flesh
[1:01:59] the invisible become invisible it's
[1:02:02] operated in you
[1:02:03] you know you are powerhouse you know
[1:02:05] you're anointed
[1:02:06] you know you are charged you know you
[1:02:09] are monetized
[1:02:11] because the spirit is operating in you
[1:02:15] oh glory to god let's go the tree is
[1:02:18] perfection
[1:02:20] the ministry comes to its of perfection
[1:02:24] when it reproduce
[1:02:28] christ again in natural
[1:02:31] among human beings that's how you know
[1:02:35] the ministry come to perfection
[1:02:36] any mind exhausting and you're trying
[1:02:38] that thing and manipulating and sharing
[1:02:40] any word
[1:02:41] no no the ministry maturity
[1:02:46] maturity of the ministry
[1:02:49] is reproduction of the original grain
[1:02:52] christ
[1:02:53] reproduce here's why that is guaranteed
[1:02:56] it's like a sign of this is guarantee
[1:02:59] because the wave sheath which is malachi
[1:03:01] 4
[1:03:02] is the first one that comes to maturity
[1:03:04] that's the first one that god accept
[1:03:07] as a sign of the rest that will come
[1:03:10] so god took william branham and harvest
[1:03:13] him in front of us
[1:03:15] with all these signs all the wonders all
[1:03:16] the miracles all the turtle
[1:03:18] manifestation
[1:03:19] and that is something to god i think the
[1:03:21] son of man was waved
[1:03:23] prophesied let others go in and come we
[1:03:26] coming
[1:03:27] oh glory to god all that's going to come
[1:03:29] it's a sign
[1:03:31] it's an anchor it's assurance it's a
[1:03:33] surety that order is going to come
[1:03:36] because one has been clipped oh glory to
[1:03:39] god do you get it now
[1:03:42] you can't clip a corn and the whole
[1:03:44] field is gone
[1:03:45] and when again you're getting rice or
[1:03:47] you can send some kind of plum or apple
[1:03:49] something like that
[1:03:50] the reason you cut the corn is because
[1:03:51] this is the first corn
[1:03:53] that come to maturity you're cutting
[1:03:55] from the corn field
[1:03:56] you cut it to say you know what the rest
[1:03:58] coming they might be small and growing
[1:04:00] in power and stature because remember
[1:04:02] when when when when ramsay's going in
[1:04:04] power who is it going in power too you
[1:04:05] know
[1:04:06] when ramsay's getting in position
[1:04:08] hallelujah moses are getting position
[1:04:10] you know
[1:04:11] oh glory to god and the world comes to
[1:04:13] churches can be ahead of us you know
[1:04:14] come on now come on now they can't be
[1:04:17] ahead of us
[1:04:18] i'm not scripted for that and have no
[1:04:20] scripture for that
[1:04:22] we have to be ahead of them god always
[1:04:24] ahead of them
[1:04:25] god was the head of goliath because
[1:04:27] david went through being lying
[1:04:28] look at the lord i shall go like i
[1:04:30] didn't know what hit him
[1:04:33] glory to god goliath didn't even know
[1:04:36] what hit him
[1:04:39] but david wasn't in the fightful
[1:04:43] the army fall he wasn't qualified inside
[1:04:46] there
[1:04:47] hallelujah actually trying to ridicule
[1:04:48] and embarrass him
[1:04:50] because he's not in the in the in
[1:04:51] directing but he saw sword in the armor
[1:04:53] and what not dvd you know i mean
[1:04:55] it being lying yes i deal with them the
[1:04:57] god that delivered me from the being
[1:04:59] i'll take all god oh hallelujah
[1:05:02] oh my i love it i love it i love it i'm
[1:05:05] enjoying it
[1:05:06] god wait for satan's eden to unveil this
[1:05:09] bride there's going to be unveiling of
[1:05:10] the bride of jesus christ
[1:05:12] oh he will take the veil off of that
[1:05:13] bride nobody knew the writer is
[1:05:15] oh people claiming and making all kind
[1:05:17] of claims and so on but
[1:05:18] god going to do his mysterious work
[1:05:21] hallelujah
[1:05:22] okay now watch so this so then he said
[1:05:25] you know
[1:05:26] um no that was the cornerstone
[1:05:29] not what it was rejected and the
[1:05:31] cornerstone of hell the building
[1:05:32] is the keystone now you know what the
[1:05:34] keystone is right that you want that
[1:05:36] like this and an arch the one that locks
[1:05:39] it
[1:05:39] that's the keystone how many knows what
[1:05:41] a keystone is when the arch is built
[1:05:44] then the keys don't hold it together the
[1:05:45] cornerstone is what holds up the
[1:05:47] building is that right
[1:05:48] and the cornerstone in the pyramid was a
[1:05:49] capstone was a keystone
[1:05:51] held the rest of it together now the
[1:05:53] keystone was rejected so the keystone is
[1:05:55] the same as the cornerstone the same as
[1:05:56] the capstone
[1:05:58] hallelujah rejected isn't that right now
[1:06:01] what did that represent when enoch built
[1:06:03] it
[1:06:03] here it was taking place it was like a
[1:06:05] gospel church now it was way down white
[1:06:07] like the pyramid
[1:06:08] i'll skip down a little bit john wesley
[1:06:09] priest sanification the church become a
[1:06:11] minority
[1:06:12] and then the pentecostal restoration of
[1:06:14] the gifts what is it
[1:06:15] way down in here way down from the looks
[1:06:17] of the head down there
[1:06:19] is closer to the head up here is a
[1:06:21] little closer and that's got to be
[1:06:23] absolutely to fit with the rest it's got
[1:06:25] to be honed
[1:06:26] so you see on the bottom is wide as you
[1:06:28] go nearer nearer as you go higher you're
[1:06:30] going to the head right he said to fit
[1:06:32] it has got to be honed
[1:06:33] so you bring in a different terminology
[1:06:36] to show you this thing going deeper
[1:06:38] it's going further it going sharper
[1:06:41] hallelujah in order to fit
[1:06:43] is not church member business as in the
[1:06:47] bible that's nice that nobody's simple
[1:06:48] the simple
[1:06:49] they're foolish as foolish and they're
[1:06:50] not going into the wisdom they're in the
[1:06:52] middle
[1:06:53] in a way they're kind of foolish just
[1:06:55] want to say simple
[1:06:56] this is the word called honed and horn
[1:06:59] is what you do with metallurgy metallic
[1:07:01] is it's fine uh to find measurement
[1:07:05] honed measurement so listen what he said
[1:07:06] you know so watch
[1:07:08] so then now it's got to be honed so then
[1:07:10] you say in that pyramid
[1:07:12] you can take a razor blade and you can't
[1:07:14] run it between them
[1:07:15] rocks where the water was it fits so
[1:07:17] together
[1:07:19] god prophecy is taking the elect
[1:07:22] out to the pentecostal church that
[1:07:24] hybrid pulling it out
[1:07:26] and finish up the word and it's got to
[1:07:28] be so close
[1:07:29] until the word itself will blend with
[1:07:31] this word
[1:07:32] he use another word now he gone from
[1:07:34] horned to blend
[1:07:36] oh hallelujah i love it i love it this
[1:07:39] is not skim milk
[1:07:40] he takes honed and then come aboard
[1:07:43] blend
[1:07:44] blend with the wood here come the
[1:07:46] headstone crying grace grace the
[1:07:47] headstone
[1:07:48] there you are you see it's way wide down
[1:07:50] here that's the button pyramid
[1:07:51] and they're getting closer closer closer
[1:07:54] and looter justification and he comes
[1:07:56] with his identification
[1:07:57] here comes the pentecostal gifts but god
[1:08:00] is taken from deer and holding out a
[1:08:03] bunch
[1:08:05] holding out a bunch to make
[1:08:09] our ministry just exactly like that were
[1:08:13] there
[1:08:14] because it's got to fit with the word
[1:08:16] and there the right is taken up
[1:08:18] so you have to get a bond somewhere oh
[1:08:20] hallelujah praise
[1:08:22] god hallelujah a bunch isn't that right
[1:08:26] are we finding out that the message of
[1:08:28] life is the thought
[1:08:29] the fourth message brought back life so
[1:08:31] it's kankarwarm lucas palmer woman
[1:08:32] caterpillar
[1:08:33] and we know four messengers of debt and
[1:08:35] four messages of life
[1:08:36] he said justification he brought back
[1:08:39] the pulp
[1:08:40] some vacation brought back the back
[1:08:41] doctrine of holiness what brought back
[1:08:43] the leaf
[1:08:43] and the crystals what is many cultures
[1:08:45] clap their hands rejoicing
[1:08:47] and pentecostal so we have to have all
[1:08:51] we can't say that justification we can
[1:08:52] be justified like luther is no we need
[1:08:54] just vision plus
[1:08:56] you have to live a holy life with our
[1:08:57] whole life and sacrifice you're not
[1:08:59] accepted
[1:08:59] so the same addiction is also the
[1:09:01] pentecostal baptism that is also plus
[1:09:05] the word okay so what was the thought
[1:09:09] the thought was the word itself the word
[1:09:12] made
[1:09:12] flesh fruits of the proof
[1:09:16] of the resurrection sign that christ
[1:09:20] has finally after justification being
[1:09:23] planted
[1:09:24] sanification being planted baptism of
[1:09:26] the holy ghost organization died of
[1:09:28] christ has again centered himself like
[1:09:31] the cap of the pyramid
[1:09:33] first line justification sanctification
[1:09:35] personally goes then
[1:09:37] comes the cap what is it he's explaining
[1:09:39] all of that right here
[1:09:40] that holy ghost bunch being honed out
[1:09:46] outside of a holy ghost bunch what god
[1:09:49] wrapped her in
[1:09:50] you have to be part of the holy ghost
[1:09:52] bunch in order to be honed
[1:09:54] god can't hold a non-holy ghost bunch
[1:09:59] let me say that again god and cutting
[1:10:02] or honing a non-holy ghost bunch
[1:10:06] you have to become part of that holy
[1:10:08] ghost
[1:10:09] bunch in order to be honed and the
[1:10:12] horning
[1:10:12] is to fit you to take it to rapture oh
[1:10:16] glory to god this is sweet tonight
[1:10:18] i know about you but this is food for my
[1:10:20] soul tonight
[1:10:22] hallelujah watch
[1:10:25] watch that holy ghost bunch being
[1:10:28] honed so that he can fit
[1:10:31] with the same kind of a ministry he had
[1:10:35] when he went away when he comes back it
[1:10:37] will catch the whole thing in the
[1:10:38] rapture
[1:10:39] where the justified sanctified the
[1:10:42] background only goes
[1:10:42] that pyramid will live again the house
[1:10:45] of god
[1:10:46] will live again oh give the lord a shout
[1:10:49] i will restore saith the lord hallelujah
[1:10:52] all glory on christ was manifested to
[1:10:55] destroy the work of the devil isn't that
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:57] hallelujah he was born to be that to
[1:10:59] destroy the works of the devil
[1:11:00] his body is to do the same because the
[1:11:03] body and head is together
[1:11:04] oh glory to god you see what we coming
[1:11:06] for to destroy the works of the devil
[1:11:08] it had no devil castle in the old
[1:11:10] testament no scripture the closer it was
[1:11:12] david playing the harp and the spirit
[1:11:14] leaving soul temporarily
[1:11:15] but devils had to cast out when they
[1:11:17] come to the new testament
[1:11:18] and when jesus said he said my name the
[1:11:20] first thing jesus said you've got castle
[1:11:22] devils
[1:11:23] you're gonna let them devils know what
[1:11:24] kingdom you are from oh
[1:11:26] glory to god let them know what power
[1:11:28] source is behind you
[1:11:30] oh glory to god because lucifer was
[1:11:32] kicked on the earth
[1:11:33] and the first authority and power god
[1:11:35] gave his disciples was over devils
[1:11:38] oh glory to god and there's an invasion
[1:11:39] of devils or
[1:11:41] in the churches and homes and family
[1:11:42] lives we've got to back them up and we
[1:11:44] will back them up
[1:11:45] oh give the lord a shout because jesus
[1:11:48] raised up to destroy the work of the
[1:11:49] devil
[1:11:50] and his wife will do the same also oh
[1:11:53] give the lord a shout amen
[1:11:55] hallelujah but abandon we try to build
[1:11:57] it up on education
[1:11:59] we try and sponge scholarship upon the
[1:12:01] nomination and everybody want them
[1:12:03] to follow them follow them like give
[1:12:04] this one right this one it's messiahs
[1:12:06] this one is a mini on a man this one is
[1:12:07] major prophet minor prophet this one
[1:12:09] claiming all kind of thing messenger
[1:12:11] half messenger quarter messenger
[1:12:14] oh i'm looking for some kind of
[1:12:15] attention followers
[1:12:17] but we try education
[1:12:22] denomination all these things will not
[1:12:23] work as long
[1:12:25] as we have not accepted this odd stone
[1:12:28] this peculiar stone
[1:12:30] but as the building begin to materialize
[1:12:34] they realize that the hole that was left
[1:12:36] the odd stone
[1:12:37] fitted to the dot that is where the
[1:12:40] spiritual bill is today
[1:12:41] and that is why the bride building of
[1:12:44] christ is not ready for the bridegroom
[1:12:47] it's because that the builders have
[1:12:49] rejected the chief
[1:12:51] cornerstone that was laid on the day of
[1:12:53] pentecost
[1:12:54] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:57] i know my words the rejected builders
[1:13:00] reject that
[1:13:02] what did god say i lay in zion for a
[1:13:05] foundational stone
[1:13:06] i tried to a special precious
[1:13:09] cornerstone
[1:13:10] a short foundation he that believes on
[1:13:11] me shall not be ashamed
[1:13:13] shall i make his oh glory to god is not
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:17] who am i he said it's been odd people
[1:13:20] act funny
[1:13:21] they don't want they don't come into the
[1:13:23] order of our psychology or educational
[1:13:25] or
[1:13:25] learning or creeds they don't fit in
[1:13:27] there and they kicked it out
[1:13:29] because it was too or too peculiar to
[1:13:30] disagree with them the plans as we as
[1:13:33] men had
[1:13:34] ideas of what the church ought to be
[1:13:36] that's the way
[1:13:37] god has brought his church from
[1:13:38] justification signification
[1:13:41] baptism of the holy spirit and now the
[1:13:43] ministry of the spirit which is what
[1:13:46] quickens the word
[1:13:48] oh hallelujah your being is a
[1:13:51] progression yes
[1:13:52] because it's not pentecost 1906
[1:13:55] pentecost
[1:13:56] so you say justification sun vacation
[1:13:58] but holy ghost and now
[1:14:00] the ministry of the spirit which
[1:14:03] is what quickens the world so once we
[1:14:05] step into that ministry
[1:14:07] you will be quickened by the spirit oh
[1:14:10] glory to god the word will be quickened
[1:14:12] to you it will come alive in you that's
[1:14:13] why brother branham said
[1:14:14] he could preach till he all is here full
[1:14:16] of his head until the word is inspired
[1:14:19] to you
[1:14:19] you're in the same shape oh hallelujah
[1:14:23] so the cap never did come because it was
[1:14:25] a cornerstone it was a headstone
[1:14:27] in the church it was a cornerstone in
[1:14:29] the full church it was the headstone
[1:14:31] it never did come it was rejected and
[1:14:33] watch
[1:14:34] and i believe when it's coming that the
[1:14:35] church will shape into a place
[1:14:37] from justification so in other words
[1:14:39] he's not talking about this message
[1:14:41] thing you have a church and you're
[1:14:42] chasing granny i have a church here in a
[1:14:44] tabernacle here he's not talking about
[1:14:45] that they choose buildings and stuff
[1:14:46] he's talking
[1:14:47] he's talking about the shaping now he's
[1:14:48] talking about getting down to the
[1:14:49] condition the church had to be in are
[1:14:51] you with me
[1:14:51] he said watch and it's coming what the
[1:14:54] church is such a minority
[1:14:55] and a ministry will be among those
[1:14:58] people until it'll be exactly the same
[1:15:00] ministry
[1:15:01] that jesus did that will bring jesus and
[1:15:03] catch
[1:15:04] the whole thing away and all those
[1:15:06] honest true
[1:15:07] looters presbyterian baptist methodist
[1:15:10] that's born of the spirit of god will be
[1:15:11] caught away with jesus
[1:15:12] when he comes i believe that hallelujah
[1:15:15] question
[1:15:16] was the pentecost situation noisy church
[1:15:18] back at the beginning
[1:15:19] when the holy ghost fulfilled was the
[1:15:22] pentecostal church a noisy church
[1:15:25] back at the beginning when the holy
[1:15:27] ghost first fell
[1:15:28] the virgin mary like she was drunk
[1:15:30] staggering on the power of god
[1:15:32] and all of them like that and the people
[1:15:33] they say they're full of new wine
[1:15:35] that's the way the church was ordained
[1:15:39] and that's the way every church is
[1:15:41] ordained every time
[1:15:43] god has a church it will be the same
[1:15:45] kind of church
[1:15:47] shout out same kind same kind i don't
[1:15:50] care what the bishops say
[1:15:52] what the word said that i know uncertain
[1:15:54] song

[1:15:57] bible where they
[1:15:59] ever received the holy ghost without
[1:16:01] having emotions

[1:16:05] praises
[1:16:06] of god and prophecies and manifestation
[1:16:08] they never did just wake walk up
[1:16:10] shake hand with the preacher and walk

[1:16:38] praises of

[1:20:41] that will make a revival that we will
[1:20:43] find from everywhere and say the seven
[1:20:45] thunders that not even written is being

[1:20:52] not talked not spoken
[1:20:55] manifested oh my hallelujah praise god
[1:21:00] hallelujah he was the living word of god
[1:21:02] because he was expressing god
[1:21:04] through himself aha not talking word
[1:21:08] living word why because you were
[1:21:10] expressing god
[1:21:12] to himself he was so completely
[1:21:14] surrendered to god
[1:21:16] the word till he and the word was the
[1:21:19] same
[1:21:19] and that's exactly what the church ought
[1:21:21] to be today
[1:21:23] what that the word of god is the same he
[1:21:26] said just as jesus was the church
[1:21:27] supposed to be
[1:21:29] god's want to work god hates a powerless
[1:21:32] religion
[1:21:33] it's got to be power certainly it's
[1:21:35] power to save a man from sin
[1:21:37] it is power that can do signs and
[1:21:38] wonders and miracles that jesus promised
[1:21:40] you know his power to take you out of
[1:21:42] the world you couldn't just walk all the
[1:21:44] way so
[1:21:45] you see no big light and glory and
[1:21:47] rainbow but there's a power snatch it's
[1:21:49] a pull
[1:21:50] oh glory the god of power pull you in no
[1:21:52] man can come except my father draw him
[1:21:55] it's a joy in power
[1:21:56] he was in your baptist church a
[1:21:57] methodist church but a power hit you
[1:21:59] without more than that it's a more where
[1:22:01] that come from
[1:22:03] oh give the lord i showed that power it
[1:22:05] had more
[1:22:06] where that come from that power doesn't
[1:22:09] make you do signs on one of the miracles
[1:22:10] too
[1:22:11] hallelujah see god wants to work in this
[1:22:15] church
[1:22:16] god wants to work in this church so
[1:22:19] god's strategy
[1:22:20] is to take empty vessels and shape the
[1:22:23] world with them
[1:22:24] oh give the lord a shout that's his gods
[1:22:27] i'm still reading these are my torsos
[1:22:30] god's strategy is to take empty human
[1:22:32] vessels
[1:22:33] and shake the world with them but they
[1:22:36] was all standing there with their
[1:22:37] vessels turned up and god took
[1:22:38] himself and filled them up and they
[1:22:41] shook the world he poured
[1:22:43] himself into them and that's the need of
[1:22:45] today that's what we need today's
[1:22:47] empty vessels so god can fill them up
[1:22:50] god has to get empty vessels we can fill
[1:22:52] them up
[1:22:52] elijah didn't say get some vessels and
[1:22:54] borrow a lot of oil
[1:22:55] or we receive we get a good sale price
[1:22:57] in it you just say get empty vessels
[1:22:59] that's all you need and that's what it
[1:23:01] was on pentecost they had empty vessels
[1:23:02] so god could fill them up
[1:23:04] on god and brother this day demands that
[1:23:07] this day you have got to have that we
[1:23:09] have that or perish
[1:23:11] i'm going to close now we've got to have
[1:23:13] that will perish
[1:23:14] you shall become a please tonight i'm
[1:23:16] going to close too
[1:23:17] but abram he said brother the lives come
[1:23:20] off a hell that sight
[1:23:22] streams of demon power is pouring from
[1:23:24] everywhere
[1:23:25] it conquered the nations it conquered
[1:23:27] politics still is so rotten to the core
[1:23:30] it conquered churches until they know
[1:23:32] nothing but denomination
[1:23:33] are you a christian i'm a messianist are
[1:23:35] you a christian
[1:23:36] i'm a pentecostal that don't mean no
[1:23:37] more i said the other day than being a
[1:23:39] pig or a hug or a horse
[1:23:41] that has nothing to do with it you are
[1:23:43] christian
[1:23:44] when you are born again and filled with
[1:23:47] the holy ghost
[1:23:48] not until that and he didn't stop there
[1:23:51] he had the next qualification saturday
[1:23:54] and you are
[1:23:55] yielded completely to the spirit if
[1:23:58] you are not yielded to the spirit then
[1:24:01] you are not born again you don't have
[1:24:02] the holy ghost
[1:24:04] so he he's saying not only must you have
[1:24:06] the holy ghost the holy ghost must have
[1:24:07] you
[1:24:12] when you could yield to the spirit isn't
[1:24:14] that right you see you might speak in
[1:24:16] tongue shiver jump up and down
[1:24:18] paul said i can move mountains with fate
[1:24:19] i can heal the sick i cannot have
[1:24:21] knowledge of the bible
[1:24:22] i can go to seminary and learn all this
[1:24:24] stuff and everything else i'm nothing
[1:24:25] yet
[1:24:25] but maya talk about laid off a kettle
[1:24:28] demons going around powers of devil
[1:24:30] under the name of christianity teaching
[1:24:32] for doctrines the commandments of men
[1:24:34] geological seminary doctrines
[1:24:36] leaving the bible alone to say the days
[1:24:38] of mercury is past we don't need the
[1:24:40] holy ghost they say that now you know
[1:24:41] not in so many words any message having
[1:24:44] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:24:45] power thereof
[1:24:46] like we don't suppose our power we're
[1:24:48] not supposed to actual power we're
[1:24:49] supposed to stay there
[1:24:49] and preach mysteries and preach long
[1:24:51] services
[1:24:53] the longer the better the longer the
[1:24:54] service is more spiritual it appears to
[1:24:56] be
[1:24:58] the days of america has passed we don't
[1:25:00] need the holy ghost who can tame that
[1:25:02] devil
[1:25:03] god we can't do it by denomination we
[1:25:05] can't do it by eclasical forces
[1:25:07] but there was a voice one time that did
[1:25:09] it he said you will do it when you empty
[1:25:12] up
[1:25:12] and become weak pulled of yourself and
[1:25:14] let the holy ghost come in
[1:25:16] and flutter every part of you and
[1:25:18] saturate every litter of your body
[1:25:20] that's the only way to do it we don't
[1:25:21] need an organization
[1:25:23] empty vessels is what he needs that's
[1:25:25] right a call out church
[1:25:27] a little minority that will receive
[1:25:29] god's power and blessing
[1:25:30] and his message he said get empty
[1:25:32] friends
[1:25:34] get weak deny your own ability
[1:25:37] and you out in radio that will hear
