[13:57] we thank you for this tremendous
[13:59] opportunity you have given unto us to
[14:02] connect a bit to heaven and to hear from
[14:05] you what to receive from you and to be
[14:07] blessed from evil when root was
[14:10] liberating God you're allowed from body
[14:13] to be there for her to glean Lord and I
[14:16] pay a drop somebody tonight we could
[14:19] lean
[14:20] green and seek your face clean and walk
[14:24] in the light of your promises because
[14:26] that's what we live by you said man
[14:28] shouted by bread alone but by every word
[14:30] that proceed us a word of God you send a
[14:32] prophet Messenger to release promises
[14:35] that we can live by these promises that
[14:37] we can live by your torments expressed
[14:39] in a word it's unboxing on teeth and
[14:43] Lord you promise a conjuration 10 8 11
[14:45] that the prophecies will come again
[14:48] spoken to the bride father we thank you
[14:51] for the ministry that you have placed
[14:53] Among Us the Ministries and father for
[14:55] the Ministries our own world that has
[14:57] been echoing these precious promises and
[15:00] we pray that it live from this is to
[15:04] make these men make more sense to it and
[15:07] I hope they bring these things to life
[15:09] the receipts begin to come to life
[15:11] tonight in this time of prayer that we
[15:14] will ask in Jesus amen and amen God
[15:18] bless you and welcome
[15:20] and before I read the scripture there
[15:22] will be tonight
[15:23] I just want to read something here
[15:26] from this is revelation book of symbols
[15:29] Angelic beans associate together I hope
[15:32] you get that that just dropped right now
[15:34] free look if you got the Holy Spirit In
[15:38] You
[15:39] then you are candidate
[15:41] for the association
[15:43] but the Unseen World
[15:46] and the supernatural
[15:47] no wonder people can't believe in those
[15:50] things they have never come in contact
[15:52] they got nothing in here to believe it
[15:56] but when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[15:58] heart quickly
[16:00] he becomes then a two full beings but
[16:03] you right one of the earth to die
[16:15] and his body he still has his Earthly
[16:18] contact with five senses and a spirit he
[16:21] has contact with God through the Holy
[16:24] Ghost and the angels of God visit them
[16:28] speaks with them and they are messengers
[16:31] sent to God to reveal and to bring
[16:34] messages from God to the individual
[16:36] he's out to get the first thing first
[16:38] and I'll just leave it right there amen
[16:41] praise the Lord so
[16:42] what
[16:44] we are seeing tonight is the holy Lord
[16:46] make you a candidate for the
[16:49] supernatural the Unseen World
[16:52] and the decision of angels it is not
[16:55] just a natural life it's not just going
[16:57] to work going home hearing what people
[16:59] are saying in politics the news and all
[17:02] what's going on it's a little more than
[17:04] that it is to give you
[17:07] a antenna uh Crystal or whatever that
[17:11] gets you a tune but things that is not
[17:16] seen uh things that is out of this world
[17:19] and that is what the word is the word
[17:22] actually is God and when we gather like
[17:24] this to hear get a little word to
[17:26] encourage us into prayer we want to
[17:28] really tap into what God will have for
[17:30] us amen so tonight if you have your
[17:33] Bibles
[17:34] I like it to go to a portion of
[17:36] scripture tonight
[17:37] see from Matthew chapter 6 one read from
[17:41] verse one to six Matthew chapter 6.
[17:43] verse one to six
[17:45] and um it's quite strange how he got
[17:47] this but this is what we have tonight to
[17:49] show which Matthew 6 1-6
[17:52] and it says here take heed that you do
[17:55] not
[17:56] your arms before men to be seen of them
[17:59] otherwise you have no reward of your
[18:01] father
[18:03] therefore when those thine arms do not
[18:07] summer trumpet before thee as the
[18:09] Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
[18:11] the streets that they may have Glory of
[18:13] men that will I say unto you
[18:17] but when now do his arms I can give him
[18:19] right let not thy left hand Know Thy
[18:22] right hand do
[18:23] thine arms may be in secret
[18:27] and thy father which isn't secret
[18:29] himself shall rewarded open so God is
[18:32] addressing the fact that as human beings
[18:35] we do things that impress each other we
[18:37] do things that others might see we we do
[18:40] things from our ambition or if we are
[18:42] who we think we are and everything else
[18:44] and you're saying you know what I want
[18:46] you to think that of your father who
[18:49] sees in secret so I don't want you to do
[18:51] like what others do it right
[18:53] now he sends his arms thing and then he
[18:57] dropped down and verse 5 and says bendo
[19:00] prayers that is where we are tonight
[19:03] window pressed though shall not be as a
[19:06] hypocrite are for the love to preach
[19:09] standing in the synagogues in the
[19:11] corners of the streets that they may be
[19:13] a scene of men they already listen to
[19:15] you you have
[19:17] dull
[19:18] and don't press enter into that closet
[19:21] and when now I shut the door
[19:23] free to like Father which is a secret
[19:25] and thy father which is a secret shall
[19:29] your body open me I want you to hold
[19:31] this last scripture tonight
[19:33] window prayers enter into that closet
[19:36] that's where you are tonight
[19:38] a window I shut the door free to like
[19:42] father with season which is in secret
[19:43] they follow it features a secret shall
[19:46] we body openly so now I want you to see
[19:50] that closet as a place
[19:53] okay not as a not a great if you have a
[19:56] physical place an actual location but a
[19:58] place in the spirit a place where you
[20:01] could talk to God and when you could
[20:02] read upon the place
[20:04] so tonight I have this thought
[20:07] I will meet you dear
[20:09] I will meet you India
[20:11] visions and prophecies and I was really
[20:15] blessed on Wednesday night
[20:18] um
[20:19] and you know vision and prophecy Vision
[20:22] sometimes is not prophecy because of
[20:24] vision God could go back in your life
[20:27] and give a vision as to what happened
[20:28] back deal why you are in the condition
[20:31] you're in maybe what happened way back
[20:34] that's Vision there's visions and
[20:36] there's vision of the future of visions
[20:38] of the succumb that is the vision with
[20:40] prophecy
[20:41] I want to go back into something we
[20:44] shared a couple of years about
[20:46] and this was a vision that the brother
[20:47] Brandon had
[20:49] the Lord was training him and teaching
[20:51] them
[20:52] and he found himself with a baby shoe
[20:55] and with some bitty eyelets and he had a
[20:59] eight of an inch hole in his eye luck
[21:01] and about a half inch string
[21:04] and he was just trying to push it in a
[21:07] hole in other words the hole was smaller
[21:10] than the string that he's pushing in and
[21:12] I was breaking the threads all over the
[21:14] string trying to push it through that
[21:15] like that and he wouldn't do it and the
[21:18] string was being broke up at the end
[21:20] so just then I heard someone say behind
[21:23] me this one you trust don't you
[21:26] understand you can't teach
[21:30] babies
[21:32] Supernatural things
[21:35] so in reality
[21:37] the promise of power
[21:40] Supernatural
[21:42] that is not for babies
[21:44] that means you have to grow you have to
[21:47] mature you have to anything you have to
[21:49] be tested you have to face the music
[21:51] because the Lord told him you cannot
[21:54] teach babies Supernatural things and I
[21:56] looked around it was behind me and I
[21:59] recognized that voice he said you're
[22:01] using the wrong end of the Stream
[22:03] and I look down at the end of the string
[22:05] line on the floor great power string it
[22:07] was at least down to the ninth eighth of
[22:09] an inch so it was to go through the hole
[22:12] I understand I reach up the string I was
[22:15] taken again so now he's being taken into
[22:18] different dimensions different levels
[22:20] right
[22:20] and then he was taken to another level
[22:22] when I come to
[22:24] handling
[22:26] by the side of a beautiful Lake
[22:28] it was pretty and green and there was
[22:31] some fishermen all around the lake and
[22:33] they were fishing and they were catching
[22:34] small fishes and I looked out to the
[22:36] leak it was beautiful rainbow there I
[22:39] said I know this is a vision but I can't
[22:41] understand those trucks but I said you
[22:44] know I believe don't in my heart I can
[22:45] touch those right pick up the string
[22:48] and instead of it being a string it was
[22:51] a fishing poor
[22:52] just then the one behind me said I will
[22:56] teach you to fish how to consider so you
[23:00] realize but Abraham had the trainer with
[23:02] him
[23:03] he had the angel he had the Holy Spirit
[23:07] he had the Lord working with him I will
[23:09] teach you to fish how to catch those
[23:13] so he said tie on the low and I shall
[23:16] snapped the low on he said I'll throw it
[23:19] way out into the deep when you know when
[23:22] the Lord think down first pull it slow
[23:25] oh that's a really Fisherman's technique
[23:28] he said then when you do now you'll feel
[23:30] something manipulated but don't tell
[23:32] nobody what you're doing
[23:34] keep it to yourself This was
[23:37] instructions from the angel
[23:39] don't tell nobody what you're doing keep
[23:42] it to yourself I said now when you feel
[23:45] it nibble again just pull it not too
[23:47] hard and then pull it away from the
[23:50] little fish and when this cutter that
[23:53] will attract the attention of the big
[23:54] fish and they will grab it that's the
[23:57] way I'll cut it and then they will back
[23:59] on the third time set your hook for the
[24:01] catch I said I understand he said but
[24:04] keep still don't tell nobody keep still
[24:08] and sometimes
[24:10] the other chapter
[24:12] sometimes you have to zip up sometimes
[24:15] you cannot see everything you have to
[24:18] know what you're seeing okay and who
[24:21] you're saying it too
[24:22] so I had the low in my hand
[24:25] and all these fishermen turned out to be
[24:27] ministers so no the vision is unfolding
[24:30] and they come around saying go to
[24:32] Branham I know you can't you can catch
[24:35] fish oh of course that made me feel real
[24:37] good I said yes I'm a fisherman
[24:40] I could kind of fish he said no here's
[24:42] the way you do it I said you threw it
[24:44] out
[24:45] and we we out into the deep water and
[24:48] said no those little fish are fine
[24:49] Brethren but we want big ones too I said
[24:51] they see when it sinks down and there it
[24:54] is and about where it should be them
[24:56] little fish I said now when it sits
[24:58] again I give it a great big joke but
[25:01] when I did
[25:02] I pulled a whole little out of the water
[25:05] and when I did I caught a fish
[25:08] and I wondered how he ever got to learn
[25:10] his mouth cause it looked like the skin
[25:13] was stretched over the lure about the
[25:15] same size of the like her own money
[25:17] and just them
[25:19] this one who they're talking behind me
[25:22] step around in front of me it was him
[25:25] the angel of the room he had his hand
[25:28] folded
[25:29] he looked at me and said plus what I
[25:32] told you not to do I said yes God is
[25:37] right
[25:38] he said you see that first pill was when
[25:41] you used to put your hands on the people
[25:43] tell them what was their trouble
[25:45] he said the second poll was when you
[25:47] know the secrets of the heart like I
[25:49] told you and said instead of you keeping
[25:51] that to yourself you try to explain all
[25:54] about
[25:55] tell the people when you did you didn't
[25:58] know nothing about it yourself how could
[26:00] you explain it isn't that something else
[26:03] the prophet is saying he didn't know
[26:05] about it himself or you could explain so
[26:08] in reality you cannot explain what you
[26:11] don't know
[26:12] you say and you cause you cause a bunch
[26:16] of carnal impersonations to rise up you
[26:19] see what you have done Lord I'm sorry
[26:23] oh I'm so sorry I don't know what to do
[26:26] and as I was pulling the line like this
[26:30] I was trying to straight my line out he
[26:32] looked at me and he said now don't get
[26:35] your line tangled up in these kind of
[26:38] times
[26:39] and I will exalt you tonight
[26:40] right don't get your line tangled up in
[26:45] these kind of times and I thought maybe
[26:48] he's going to give me another try and I
[26:51] said I should be careful
[26:53] which one in my line in and seeing it
[26:55] taking up all right and then when he
[26:58] said that I felt myself go higher way up
[27:01] so another level again and when I was
[27:04] sat down the I always be neat and
[27:06] standing up above a great tent
[27:08] never seen such a time I just made an
[27:10] older calls team like done at the altar
[27:13] when I was down there I looked and there
[27:15] were hundreds of people standing around
[27:16] the altar weeping because they had
[27:18] accepted the Lord Jesus and they were
[27:21] just weeping out loud
[27:23] and I said oh that's more like it again
[27:27] a real-time gentleman walk onto the
[27:29] platform while brother Branham is
[27:31] resting for a few moments we will call
[27:34] the prayer he said everyone with a
[27:36] prayer card beginning with a certain
[27:37] number stand over to the right and
[27:39] notice the prayer line seemed like it
[27:41] went all around the tent out down to the
[27:43] street such a prize I looked over which
[27:47] was to my left and there it was to my
[27:49] right I was standing on the platform and
[27:52] there was a piece of canvas Church there
[27:54] and behind this canvas was a square
[27:56] building for 12 foot across 20 foot long
[28:01] something like that
[28:03] I stood and looked at it
[28:05] and I seen them bring a lady up on a
[28:07] structure
[28:08] and there was a lady dear taking her
[28:10] name on people
[28:12] through there was someone come and got
[28:14] her and push her through
[28:16] and the next man come was with crutches
[28:18] I see them stuck little building and on
[28:22] the outside the lady come out screaming
[28:24] to the top of her voice pushing the
[28:26] stretcher and then there was another
[28:28] lady on the other side looked like a
[28:29] darker woman said what happened she said
[28:32] I don't know she's I couldn't tell you
[28:34] what happened she said I'll be in
[28:36] paralyzed for 20 years and look I feel I
[28:39] never would think and plus them overcome
[28:43] the man leaping and jumping with the
[28:46] scratches in his hand and I looked at
[28:48] that and just then there's something
[28:51] noticeable there's a difference between
[28:53] the angel of the Lord and that light
[28:55] because I heard something moving that
[28:57] does when it comes at the platform and
[29:00] like whoa whoa it left me which is a
[29:03] pillar file it went right down over the
[29:07] top of that audience went and stood over
[29:10] the top of that little building
[29:12] and then step along on the top of it
[29:15] and then when it did
[29:17] this one was standing by me behind me
[29:21] the same voice the Angel's voice said I
[29:25] will meet you
[29:26] India
[29:28] and this is the third problem
[29:30] but nobody will know nothing about it
[29:33] I said I don't understand why India why
[29:36] dear he said it will not be a public
[29:39] show this time
[29:40] I said I don't understand going into
[29:43] that closet like that and he said is not
[29:46] it written by our Lord when though yes
[29:49] we not plant the Hypocrites who would
[29:52] like to be heard before men but enter
[29:54] into the secret closet to pray to the
[29:57] father who sees in secret and he who
[30:00] sees his secret shall reward you openly
[30:03] it is perfectly to the scripture every
[30:06] time it is I said I understand
[30:09] then he took me to the place and sat me
[30:11] down in this room where I was and he
[30:13] told me what to do
[30:15] put it to the time
[30:17] all right you almost finished
[30:19] okay
[30:22] if you want something to happen
[30:25] now you have to take my word for this
[30:27] if I'm planning on doing something
[30:30] I know better than to tell anybody about
[30:32] it
[30:33] not that that person will tell it what
[30:36] Satan will hear it see he can't get it
[30:40] in my heart there
[30:43] as long as God College proves up at the
[30:46] Holy Spirit
[30:46] so between me and God he don't know
[30:49] nothing about it until you speak it
[30:52] then he hears it now I'll do a certain
[30:56] thing and watch the devil cut off every
[30:59] really continuing
[31:01] or beat me to it but if I can get to
[31:04] Revelation from God just don't say
[31:06] nothing about it then it's different
[31:08] remember
[31:09] Satan will try to imprison it he will
[31:12] try to impersonate everything that the
[31:14] church will do he's trying to do it we
[31:17] have noticed it through the Antichrist
[31:19] this is one thing he cannot impersonate
[31:22] there'll be no mimics to this because
[31:24] you don't know it there is no way for
[31:26] him to know it it's the third pill he
[31:28] just
[31:29] knows nothing about it he doesn't
[31:32] understand
[31:33] all right so then let's hear it back
[31:37] again I reflected yellow I seem to like
[31:39] leave me
[31:40] and go to that building
[31:42] and go in the building and a voice said
[31:45] to me I will meet you in India that will
[31:48] be the triple
[31:50] I said why he said well it won't be a
[31:53] publisher like the others
[31:55] and I want to share five things where
[31:57] the brand I'm identified as the turtle
[32:00] and all those things have a scripture
[32:02] connected to it
[32:03] the television
[32:06] when no prayers enter that closet and
[32:09] thou have shut the door pray to thy
[32:10] father waiting in secret
[32:12] and the father within secret travel will
[32:14] be open
[32:15] two spoken word we know the scriptures
[32:18] in Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you
[32:21] that whosoever shall see into this
[32:23] mountain be don't remove or cast into
[32:25] the sea and shall not doubt in your
[32:27] heart which I believe that those things
[32:29] which his fear shall come to pass shall
[32:31] have whatever you see I spoke
[32:33] King's sword so in John 57 if you're
[32:36] bothering me and my words abide in you
[32:39] you shall ask what you will and strap it
[32:41] unto you Hebrews 4 12 for the word of
[32:44] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[32:46] than any towards sword piercing it to
[32:48] devising that stand up was full and
[32:50] spirit of the joints and Marrow as a
[32:53] result of their portion in terms of the
[32:54] heart
[32:55] form the opening of the word the
[32:58] scriptures Luke 24 27 and beginning of
[33:01] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[33:04] unto them in all the scriptures the
[33:06] things consider themselves Luke 24 45
[33:09] then he
[33:12] open he the understanding that they
[33:15] might understand the scripture and the
[33:17] final one is souls in prison and that
[33:20] scripture is First Peter 3 18 for Christ
[33:22] also has once suffered for sins than
[33:25] just for the undressed that he might
[33:26] bring us to God being put to death in
[33:29] the flesh but quickly by the Spirit by
[33:31] which also we he went and preached under
[33:34] the spirits in prison which sometimes
[33:37] were disobedient when Once the
[33:39] long-suffering of God waited in the days
[33:41] of new are the ark Was preparing wherein
[33:44] few that is eight Souls
[33:49] brother Brown
[33:51] I did something
[33:54] he said I know that King James said
[33:56] greater but you couldn't do nothing
[33:58] greater more of more of it he was one
[34:00] person he's in the whole church now more
[34:03] than this shall you do because I go to
[34:05] my father
[34:06] if this is the third probe is a great
[34:10] ministry line ahead
[34:12] he says the first flight the second was
[34:15] white doves always been released because
[34:18] of the heart but the third fight was
[34:20] Angels not Birds that's the end time the
[34:23] only indictment he said media Comfort a
[34:26] Revival of the just this is prophecy
[34:29] Harry Potter of the just and Greek power
[34:32] come among the church
[34:35] just before it is going it's not too
[34:38] hard to pray that because you promised
[34:42] it and we are looking Lord for that
[34:45] people that we know will do great things
[34:47] in our minds then he says I am your I'm
[34:50] Yours Lord
[34:52] I lay myself on this altar I hope this
[34:55] is your prayer tonight just as
[34:57] consecrated as I know how to make myself
[34:59] take the world
[35:02] from alone
[35:04] take the things from me that's
[35:06] perishable give me the Imperial
[35:09] imperishable things the will of God may
[35:12] I be able to live that worship till the
[35:15] word will be in me and I in the world
[35:17] wanted the Lord may I never think from
[35:20] it may I hold that King so so tightly
[35:22] and perpet so proofly granted law I'm
[35:26] closing final one
[35:27] remember this
[35:30] the title that begins
[35:32] the Lord
[35:34] I I will meet you in the iso the Lord
[35:38] there's no man
[35:40] that is the Lord will meet you
[35:43] not the Church of the group not a bunch
[35:46] of people uh not the message world you
[35:49] the individual here here is where a
[35:53] place
[35:56] so I want to encourage you tonight to
[35:57] say this is Prisoner
[36:00] this is you you always because dog has
[36:04] chosen
[36:05] you have to make the decision
[36:08] a decision to go his way to do his will
[36:12] pray to your father
[36:14] in secret
[36:15] and he shall reward you openly
[36:18] religious people like to go to church
[36:19] like the atmosphere
[36:22] they like the Brethren singing
[36:25] Specialists but they're religious they
[36:28] don't want to subject yourself to the
[36:29] word they don't want to come and
[36:31] obedience they don't want no
[36:33] responsibility placed on them
[36:36] what they really want is a priesthood
[36:39] what they really want is like the
[36:41] Catholic Church you know the priests do
[36:44] all this stuff and they just come toward
[36:47] something and go home
[36:49] but this is not this message this is not
[36:52] the Bride of Jesus Christ the bride have
[36:54] a responsibility to Christ and to do
[36:57] good into prayer
[36:58] becomes a responsibility now if that
[37:02] little room or that closet is connected
[37:05] to the third pool and we need a tooth
[37:08] pull to get out of this place that means
[37:11] we have to have a genuine commitment to
[37:14] this
[37:15] this secret place
[37:18] this place of waiting this place of
[37:21] prayer this has nothing to do with the
[37:23] pastor
[37:24] this has nothing to do with the elder or
[37:26] the people or again a fight for this one
[37:28] fighting you this hola fighter thing and
[37:30] that's your human agreement that is what
[37:32] have to destroy
[37:34] this after you come into spiritual
[37:35] maturity to recognize
[37:37] this is you
[37:39] and God
[37:40] if you give arms and do your praying
[37:43] everybody know what you're praying I'm
[37:44] saying and everybody singing you have
[37:46] any word but that's not what you're
[37:47] talking about he say when you pray
[37:49] like you are right now in your own home
[37:51] maybe God arranged this maybe God set
[37:53] this thing all up set this up if we had
[37:56] a permission tonight maybe we might have
[37:58] 10 people I don't know but you are here
[38:00] tonight and you're not here by chance
[38:02] God is dependent upon your words
[38:05] even though the prophecy says to you you
[38:08] call prophecy says Moses like oh I'm RAM
[38:11] and Yoshi but he said that last that's a
[38:13] thing they knew that that's why it was a
[38:15] special child they still had to pray
[38:18] for deliverance they still never pray
[38:19] for deliverance even though the
[38:21] disciples Jesus breed upon them
[38:22] receiving the Holy Ghost they still
[38:25] harvest the go through the process of
[38:28] building up a room and praising God
[38:29] continually until the fire fell until
[38:31] the power comes you can sit back in your
[38:35] rocking chair in your hammock and expect
[38:38] things to work out because you know what
[38:39] God Said
[38:40] I know what God said to him and he will
[38:43] try to thwart this revival that is
[38:46] promising right
[38:47] and you have to be able to cry out for
[38:49] everybody in your own life
[38:51] and when you cry out God could do
[38:54] something special for you tonight I say
[38:55] tonight and you can come with that
[38:58] special thing to service on Sunday and
[39:00] God could even do that triple that and
[39:03] and give you a double portion upon that
[39:05] let us borrow his or whatever heavenly
[39:08] father thank you Lord I couldn't wait to
[39:11] share this with your people about this
[39:14] vision of the Prophet had and Lord you
[39:16] said I will meet you in here and many
[39:19] times they would hear me say about the
[39:21] pillar fire hanging on the building that
[39:23] is not far-fetched that is not
[39:24] far-fetched they're here tonight the
[39:27] pillar of fire actually came over the
[39:28] room and settled over it it could come
[39:30] down in it and Lord they are the
[39:32] rebuilding that you want to come and
[39:34] dwell and it's a clover when they come
[39:36] to the church they feel the anointing
[39:37] they feel the atmosphere sometimes they
[39:39] feel it in their home they feel it
[39:40] online but Lord you want that fire that
[39:43] presence that's anointed to be within
[39:44] them this is what the whole objective
[39:46] called above us caught with us in Jesus
[39:48] Christ now God in us by the Holy Spirit
[39:51] oh God come tonight in a special way
[39:53] come tonight and visitation come tonight
[39:56] come tonight and see them come tonight
[39:58] and be different come tonight in
[40:00] restoration come tonight and forgive
[40:02] this come tonight and refill it come
[40:04] tonight in Dynamics and pour it upon
[40:06] your people tonight May no one be the
[40:08] same after tonight Lord May there be a
[40:11] special Supernatural touch to the elect
[40:13] guarded in this little virtual room
[40:15] tonight May Fire Fall may they get the
[40:18] unction to pray may they not have to
[40:19] worry what which to see and I do not
[40:21] want to ask God but may you put seeds in
[40:24] their hearts words upon their lips that
[40:26] they can generally craft unto you and
[40:28] the prophet Lord when you hear them
[40:29] Weeping at the altar trying out allowed
[40:32] oh God when Anthony was striking a cry
[40:34] out to cry out Lord some point in time
[40:37] the people have to cry out that's how
[40:39] you set it up to cry out for what we
[40:41] have need of to cry out what we are
[40:43] testing for to see what we need of oh
[40:45] God made begin tonight let us spark off
[40:48] something in the people's heart I don't
[40:50] know how I don't know how you you bring
[40:52] this to me to share with them I will
[40:54] meet you in there they each one is an

[1:39:16] if the power is
[1:39:18] in the prayer but would be the grace of
[1:39:21] God but we are praying tonight we are
[1:39:23] praying for baptized before we are
[1:39:25] praying for the sick to be healed we are
[1:39:27] praying there be a Revival in the church
[1:39:29] to get the trash out we are praying for
[1:39:31] oh God and blister who brought to come
[1:39:33] into action we are praying just as a
[1:39:35] promise Lord what it mean
[1:39:49] it was great being here I'm great in
[1:39:52] God's presence you know I was listening
[1:39:54] and reading of um listening audio of of
[1:39:58] the most Revival you know the professor
[1:40:00] and his family was sick and the Lord
[1:40:04] revealed to him that his God's will for
[1:40:06] that man to be healed so he went and
[1:40:07] tell him you know
[1:40:08] um his course we should be healed so the
[1:40:10] man was glad to hear that he said he
[1:40:11] will talk to him about it
[1:40:14] and when he prayed the Lord told him
[1:40:16] that he'll be here at five o'clock on
[1:40:18] certain day and so like that and he
[1:40:20] began to testify what the Lord told him
[1:40:21] it was scary at first for the man who
[1:40:24] had prayed for him was like the
[1:40:25] intercessor playing on his behalf
[1:40:26] because he never had that before where
[1:40:28] to have a date that time but come five
[1:40:30] o'clock that very same day when he woke
[1:40:32] up 5 a.m in the morning he got off he
[1:40:35] couldn't walk or something like that he
[1:40:36] got straight off his bed and started he
[1:40:39] had to walk to the church and he got and
[1:40:41] he said why am I getting off the bed the
[1:40:43] devil tell him this just let us take
[1:40:44] just in case just in case and he said I
[1:40:46] was just the devil and he walked
[1:40:48] straight down to the church it was a two
[1:40:50] miles and whatnot and that caused a
[1:40:53] whole experience in the city The Village
[1:40:55] whether he's in because everybody knew
[1:40:57] what he's talking about the Lord told
[1:40:58] him but it was so real that what God
[1:41:01] said he can't lie he has to keep his
[1:41:05] word and I want you to know what God
[1:41:07] said about you about yourself
[1:41:11] you've got to keep the word to the
[1:41:13] second the minute or whatever he said it
[1:41:16] will come to pass this word we have we
[1:41:19] need to be trusted don't trust in
[1:41:21] yourself trust what
[1:41:23] this is what we hold on to God said it's
[1:41:24] gonna be a Revival dear God Revival PPA
[1:41:27] for it God said
[1:41:28] God said we want to be a victory dig me
