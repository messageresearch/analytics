[50:59] that's my title this morning
[51:01] the time of the latter rain and an
[51:04] inspiration occifer rain oh praise God
[51:07] you gotta have the acts for the rain
[51:10] yourself and that rain is coming for
[51:12] everyone grass in the field oh praise
[51:15] the name of the Lord blessed be the
[51:18] Lord's just all the time we last on a
[51:20] message about a word living with the
[51:22] word made flesh and this is the prophet
[51:24] from the comforter he says now watch
[51:26] what is our comfort today it's when we
[51:30] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:32] and the power of the Living God living
[51:35] in us and that's with the word of the
[51:38] Living God we stand and that word made
[51:41] flesh dwell among us now that same word
[51:43] that was made flesh and dwell among us
[51:46] has become our flesh he is with you now
[51:50] but he shall be in you know that same
[51:53] word that that prophet spoke that same
[51:56] word that was made flesh that same word
[51:58] dwells in the church and here the catch
[52:02] now therefore if we don't compromise
[52:05] that word and we stay right with it if
[52:09] we don't compromise it that same word
[52:12] living in you will produce the same
[52:15] thing that it did when he was made flesh
[52:18] because your flesh holds it
[52:22] so God made a way for your flesh to hold
[52:25] the world remember it has to come into
[52:27] your walk into your flesh and your feet
[52:30] isn't that right and that's the reason
[52:32] visions can break through the sound
[52:34] barrier that's the reason vision and
[52:35] brick to the Sun barrier does see at the
[52:37] Lord because it's the word coming forth
[52:39] from a spirit amen
[52:41] so here we go now are you ready so this
[52:45] is a vision that the Prophet had in the
[52:47] early years so we started with a vision
[52:50] this morning this is a vision
[52:53] two years later I've been praying in a
[52:55] cave where I would go to pray but a
[52:57] dusty in a cave
[52:59] one afternoon I walked out lead my Bible
[53:02] on a log on the wind blew it open the
[53:04] Hebrews the sixth chapter which said
[53:06] that in the last days how it would be if
[53:10] we fell away from the truth and renew
[53:13] ourselves again unto repentance there
[53:16] was no more sacrifice for sin how that
[53:18] falls and T cells which were 90
[53:20] rejection whose energy be burned but the
[53:22] rain commits upon the earth to water it
[53:26] to dress it and thorns and kissable be
[53:28] rejected but the wit would be gathered
[53:30] and I thought well it just had the wind
[53:33] blew that up well I lay the Bible down
[53:35] again and I thought well no and here
[53:37] come the wind and blew it open it
[53:39] happened three times seems pleased I
[53:42] said it strange and I raised up and
[53:45] thought Lord why would you open the
[53:48] Bible for me to read that when I get
[53:51] down to where Torn's and t-cells which
[53:53] is nigh on the rejection lose energy be
[53:56] burnt I thought why would you open that
[53:59] to me there and as I look across the
[54:03] vision broke now these visions come
[54:07] without pulling any gear it's just God I
[54:11] looked now don't know miss any words now
[54:14] just listen carefully I looked and seen
[54:17] an earth that was turning in front of me
[54:20] and it was all discs up
[54:23] I guess that is like when it have like
[54:26] to take a fork and fork it up like us
[54:27] till it up them this Cup
[54:30] there was a man dressed in white when
[54:33] the wrong showing wheat
[54:34] and after he went around the curvature
[54:36] of the earth around come a man look
[54:38] horrible
[54:39] he was just in black he was trying weed
[54:42] seeds over it the board come up together
[54:45] when they did the boat was thirsty
[54:48] because Irene was needed boat with this
[54:53] tea because Irene was needed each one
[54:59] looked like 3m with his little head bent
[55:02] over Lord Sandrine
[55:05] Sandrine no this is the vision and great
[55:08] clouds come up and the rain fell upon
[55:11] both of them and when it did the little
[55:15] we jump up and begin to say praise the
[55:17] Lord praise the Lord a little we'd jump
[55:19] right at the same set and what prison or
[55:21] prison log and then the vision was
[55:25] interpreted the rain falls on the just
[55:28] and the unjust the same spirit can fall
[55:31] in a meetin and everyone with Joyce and
[55:32] it hypocrites Christians all together
[55:34] exactly right but what is it by their
[55:37] fruits they unknown that's the only way
[55:40] it can never be known then you see how
[55:43] since Wild Oats wild wheat and grain
[55:45] sometimes impersonates genuine domestic
[55:48] great so close that it would deceive the
[55:51] very elect 'add I think we are living in
[55:54] a timely age that these things should be
[55:56] preached on and talked about so close in
[56:01] the last days that he could not depend
[56:04] upon a citizen churches separate them
[56:06] same Methodists or Baptists or pinnacles
[56:08] suffer so he sends his angels to
[56:10] separate them and angel is coming to
[56:15] bring the separation between right and
[56:17] wrong and no one can do that but the
[56:20] angel of the Lord and he is the one
[56:24] that's going to tell which is right and
[56:26] which is wrong God sent he sent His
[56:28] angels at the last times not angels
[56:30] don't you hear but angels at the last
[56:32] time and an angel is actually a
[56:34] messenger notice he said the foolish or
[56:38] world and also what the seed was so you
[56:42] have to identify this is a vision yet no
[56:45] he's gonna identify the shore and what
[56:46] the seed is
[56:48] because I have to know what the seed is
[56:50] and you're gonna know what seed is
[56:52] coming inside of you and what seed you
[56:54] already got oh praise Him a lot isn't
[56:57] that wonderful
[56:57] no the saw was he the Son of God who
[57:01] sent for went forth sowing seed the
[57:03] enemy came behind him was the devil and
[57:06] sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the
[57:10] right seed no he said the seed is the
[57:14] word of God and Jesus sent us in the
[57:16] place the word is a seed and every seed
[57:18] will bring forth of its kind
[57:21] now if the Christian the cheerin of the
[57:24] God has become the seed of God so you
[57:27] have to become God's seed like Noor was
[57:30] like Moses was like Abraham was you
[57:34] yourself have become God's seeded on the
[57:37] earth hallelujah
[57:39] now if the churn of God has become the
[57:42] seed of God they must be the word of God
[57:44] the word manifested in the ears are
[57:47] living in so God gave his promise at the
[57:50] beginning and each it had its seed its
[57:53] time and its promises when Noah came on
[57:56] the scene he was a seed of God for that
[57:58] age the Word of God when Moses come he
[58:01] couldn't come at Noah's message it
[58:02] wouldn't work he was the seed of God at
[58:04] that time when Christ come he could not
[58:06] come at nor on Moses age message isn't
[58:09] that right now we have lived to Luther's
[58:12] age Wesley is methodist age Pentecostal
[58:14] age each age has given a promise of the
[58:16] world and the people of that age that
[58:20] manifests not porcfest not not not not a
[58:25] doofus that manifests this the promise
[58:29] word is the seed of that age in other
[58:33] words the manifestation will be the
[58:36] interpretation little after wonder about
[58:38] it it's being manifested or do you
[58:41] believe that now all this happen under a
[58:44] church and who church on watch I'm gonna
[58:46] doing that you know this has to do with
[58:48] the word promised being manifested
[58:51] because when Jesus came is that
[58:53] Pharisees in that Sadducees a larger
[58:56] audience it had all kind of types of
[58:58] churches but
[58:59] he came according to promise all glory
[59:03] to God and the bride will come according
[59:05] to promise he promised a revival he
[59:09] promised a super Church he promised the
[59:11] people that know their God shall be
[59:14] strong so if you're weak you have to
[59:16] know your God it means you have to come
[59:18] forward not to get to know who you are
[59:20] is your God bigger than your problem so
[59:23] it'll also color with a heavy shoulder
[59:25] like that your God bigger than your
[59:27] situation you have to do con Yenny press
[59:30] you only get that ready for you don't
[59:32] know your God but your God open the Red
[59:34] Sea you're going to open the blinds I
[59:36] your God raise the dead your God heals
[59:40] the set your God
[59:41] costas your God your God is away may
[59:45] come that's your God I don't know what
[59:48] Nora God your God he's a kadhai mommy's
[59:52] he's a court of war Oh hallelujah praise
[59:57] God hey man so jesus said they are the
[1:00:04] children of the kingdom the
[1:00:06] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:11] operating to his children is the seed of
[1:00:14] the kingdom at that age not somebody in
[1:00:18] this group or somebody in that group or
[1:00:20] somebody said hey seed no he said he can
[1:00:22] try it he qualified the manifestation of
[1:00:27] the Holy Spirit operated in those
[1:00:31] children is the seed of the kingdom of
[1:00:34] God
[1:00:34] so Satan sowed discord or the seed of
[1:00:39] discrepancy
[1:00:40] he loves discord amen
[1:00:44] he was the one guilty of doing this
[1:00:46] horrible thing and Satan sword is see
[1:00:48] from the beginning when God places for
[1:00:50] his harvest of humans upon the earth
[1:00:52] Adam of course not had a knowledge of
[1:00:55] the truth and right and wrong but he has
[1:00:57] never come to that yet but we find out
[1:00:59] God gave his children his word for the
[1:01:02] defense we have no other defense than
[1:01:06] the Word of God that is our defense
[1:01:09] no bomb shelter there is no hiding place
[1:01:12] there is no Arizona or California or
[1:01:15] going to America there is no defense but
[1:01:18] the Word of God the Word of God your
[1:01:20] defense and it will defeat the devil any
[1:01:23] place anytime anywhere under any
[1:01:27] condition the word can never be defeated
[1:01:30] it is so powerful that Jesus said heaven
[1:01:34] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:01:36] could never pass away
[1:01:39] could we get my shot for the world and
[1:01:43] every word is a seed or a yummy season
[1:01:50] he's our only defense being in him we
[1:01:54] are safe
[1:01:55] Jesus was so confident of the prophetic
[1:01:59] utterance from the David's mouth I shall
[1:02:02] not suffer my Holy One see corruption
[1:02:04] David spoke that out jesus knew the
[1:02:07] scripture so he know he has the brains
[1:02:09] within three days he was so confident of
[1:02:12] the prophetic creative word that was
[1:02:15] spoken to the Prophet David he said
[1:02:17] destroy this body and the treatise I
[1:02:20] will raise it up myself
[1:02:26] Laurie Jesus wasn't imagining anything
[1:02:31] he wasn't hoping it gonna happen
[1:02:33] he no court shall I kill you that was
[1:02:37] not David that was the Spirit of God
[1:02:40] coming up on David ringing prophetic
[1:02:43] creative utterance and if that spirit
[1:02:50] come upon me today and speaks to you it
[1:02:55] can't feel because what Caroline or give
[1:03:00] the Lord are so Cano
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:06] hallelujah hallelujah yes yes yes may be
[1:03:12] seated
[1:03:12] we men know this harvest and at the
[1:03:17] beginning when God saw this seed upon
[1:03:18] the earth and give it into his hands of
[1:03:20] his children his family to keep that
[1:03:23] world that was the offense defense to
[1:03:25] keep the world
[1:03:25] here come the enemy broke the barrier by
[1:03:28] sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to
[1:03:31] the Word of God God told him you can eat
[1:03:34] of every tree in the garden but the
[1:03:35] trees in the midst don't touch that
[1:03:37] because they tell you eat that day you
[1:03:38] die Satan came to the serpent and ax
[1:03:41] what did God say the cold blood wasn't
[1:03:43] talking to him so you have to invite
[1:03:47] information and when Eve said because
[1:03:50] her husband was all to work and when the
[1:03:52] Eve
[1:03:52] where God say we could either go
[1:03:54] retrieve a dead tree in the midst
[1:03:56] we shall we shall surely that he said

[1:04:16] him and she fell with that and then
[1:04:22] given a husband piece of it later and he
[1:04:25] fell true but she was deceived because
[1:04:28] she thought she was right the husband
[1:04:30] wasn't received he went with her and you
[1:04:32] know he's wrong because you know what
[1:04:34] God said it's not right that's why God
[1:04:36] come to break the curse and that's why
[1:04:38] Kyra come to break the curse of sin and
[1:04:40] death so you have to study about cellnet

[1:41:06] God within the Bible is as water us and
[1:41:08] every promise has the same power of
[1:41:12] creation behind it that is God's Word
[1:41:15] data beginning if we believe it to be
[1:41:17] the Word of God it depends on where the
[1:41:19] seed falls if it falls into grown that
[1:41:22] can create a moisture and nourishment
[1:41:25] around the promise of God it will bring
[1:41:27] forth every promise the Bible me that is
[1:41:30] why we strongly emphasize worship here
[1:41:31] I'm praising God because Barham says the
[1:41:34] praising and worshipping is decreasing
[1:41:36] he water atmosphere for the seeds
[1:41:38] germinate and grew and so on I got an
[1:41:41] e-type it with Rebecca
[1:41:42] Elijah ill Ilyas I asked the Lord the
[1:41:45] damsel that watered my camel and give me
[1:41:48] water let her be the one VISAA okay
[1:41:51] everybody one husband but you see the
[1:41:54] other a certain behavior so Eli Lilly is

[1:42:04] every kind of caught and clothes he
[1:42:05] wearing you were looking for behavior he
[1:42:08] asks courts specific let the damsel that
[1:42:11] will give me water and water my camels
[1:42:13] if you know what come and have a big
[1:42:15] hump I don't miss gallons in this whole
[1:42:20] - and our buckets pull camel nice
[1:42:23] custody children say that but is he not
[1:42:27] knowledge - a technique that she's
[1:42:29] another watch the water cover all
[1:42:31] ancestors by some snobbish notions one
[1:42:32] who is that man the man who that man is
[1:42:35] I'm a nice man behind that man you know
[1:42:38] Batman Beyond a man is Isaac
[1:42:40] so watch Rebecca come she said to see
[1:42:44] can I water for you when it cometh
[1:42:46] Rebecca and think more no Isaac she's
[1:42:49] not thinking about that she sees
[1:42:50] somebody that she want the self
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:54] it's hot and have no um I like how you
[1:42:58] look

[1:43:02] we look my blood I take him he's not
[1:43:05] there for blood to take him on a
[1:43:06] particular it's a silver and was sent
[1:43:09] out on Eli and Rebecca knew nothing
[1:43:11] about that
[1:43:13] so here were the bottom said the same
[1:43:15] camera she watered the same candle
[1:43:18] teacher to Isaac I mean say the same
[1:43:21] word yet that you water with your
[1:43:23] praises but take it to the Holy Ghost
[1:43:34] so that's why I know if you're not
[1:43:37] prison and worshipping bored us doctor
[1:43:40] coming right yet so you don't know
[1:43:42] whether it was the Isaac or glory look
[1:43:45] go see if you want to see Isaac started
[1:43:49] coming right by giving the camera some
[1:43:51] good water because the camera presenter
[1:43:54] word which is a power to take it away
[1:43:57] after go but that word need water
[1:44:00] sadness Aaron
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:08] maybe season prophecy this time spoke
[1:44:13] original seed prophecy ah you enjoin the
[1:44:17] Lord this morning you've been trying to
[1:44:19] work this morning you in the spirit this
[1:44:22] morning listen to the prophecy remember
[1:44:25] there will be a denominational British
[1:44:28] government pretty soon it will be
[1:44:30] terrific they will bring themselves
[1:44:33] together into this Federation of
[1:44:35] churches and this kind of a church will
[1:44:39] be put out of operation as far as they
[1:44:42] know it's at that time that Jesus will
[1:44:48] appear and he will show which is random
[1:44:51] which is not remember Christian friends
[1:44:54] I'm a man I can make mistakes but God
[1:44:57] being God cannot make a mistake all the
[1:45:00] words has been written must be fulfilled
[1:45:03] jesus said so so we got things in the
[1:45:06] scripture that money fulfill and this is
[1:45:08] one of them this boycott is to come but
[1:45:12] before this broker can come of the
[1:45:15] mocking of the beasts here we go there
[1:45:18] has to be a seed soon forgot to take out
[1:45:21] a church out of it before the master of
[1:45:26] the beasts before the boy could come
[1:45:28] there has to be a seed sown to take the
[1:45:32] church out Oh
[1:45:34] glory to God so what to come here for to
[1:45:38] get seed
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:49] what's the secret the work is in the
[1:45:53] brain that mean the bride could see
[1:45:56] Donna she is pregnant with God all right
[1:46:06] let's go
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:09] the shock has to leave the seed to get
[1:46:14] the seed in the presence of the Sun so
[1:46:17] it can be ripened right now so we know
[1:46:20] the shock come like the Pentecostals was
[1:46:23] like a shell over the seed and when it's
[1:46:26] green the shock is green and the seed is
[1:46:28] dream but then here comes the Sun and
[1:46:31] when the Sun set the heat and trials and
[1:46:34] tests and tribulation and pressure
[1:46:38] people do like that you know pressure
[1:46:40] come to Jesus everything will be all
[1:46:42] right come to Jesus tool best to be
[1:46:43] stress is that right not just a sign on
[1:46:45] pipoca ignore that all that come to
[1:46:50] court must suffer persecution don't call
[1:46:53] me that
[1:46:53] too blessed to be stressed foolishness
[1:46:54] that not anything memorize this man
[1:46:56] figured I want to comfort this day self
[1:47:00] so after the pressure comes down side of
[1:47:03] heat the shock after dry and pull away
[1:47:07] for the sea to get right so when the sub
[1:47:11] shop drying Under the Sun at ripening
[1:47:14] seed she becomes more mature right okay
[1:47:19] so then in the revelation is the shock
[1:47:21] was only a carrier of the green all the
[1:47:24] plant life okay so I plant a seed alpha
[1:47:27] church it shoot up a bleed stalk tassel
[1:47:31] and it come back to original again to
[1:47:33] the top all this promoted life is as
[1:47:35] carriers it's a carrier of the life but
[1:47:39] all the life is got up in the seed when
[1:47:43] it come back in the seed the bride or
[1:47:45] the church or the elect have original
[1:47:47] seed with the life locked up in it all
[1:47:50] that serious and true is they get writen
[1:47:53] and then be buried because it cannot
[1:47:57] bury a green seed so that's why going to
[1:48:00] harvest you into rightness or glory to
[1:48:03] God as you can see the need to die out
[1:48:05] break out and reproduce the green Oh
[1:48:09] hallelujah
[1:48:11] what about him says Squatch remember
[1:48:15] there's no more seed promise to a woman
[1:48:16] after Mary so Mary had to see but she
[1:48:20] was like shocked the seed was Christ in
[1:48:22] Mary isn't that right there's no money
[1:48:24] nominations promised after Pentecost
[1:48:25] it's the rapture and the bride coming
[1:48:27] forth from here the seed the wood will
[1:48:30] manifest again okay here we go notice
[1:48:32] how close it is Matthew 24:24 the two
[1:48:35] spirits in the last days the church
[1:48:37] spirit of the church people it's a
[1:48:41] spirit now and the bride spirit of the
[1:48:43] pride people would be so close together
[1:48:45] till you see the very left as possible
[1:48:47] so the Church of aspirational do let
[1:48:50] them tire it's quite a Sunday you can
[1:48:57] tell horse the bright spirit bring to
[1:49:01] worship God because jesus said the
[1:49:03] overcome and the true worshipers will
[1:49:06] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:49:08] truth
[1:49:09] just members yet a hinder you untied
[1:49:11] upset you but you're the persona go
[1:49:15] remember we'd and week going together
[1:49:16] you know you can't separate a little now
[1:49:21] I carry bleak all the ways you can
[1:49:26] preach that if you can't speak that
[1:49:29] because I don't know who is who the
[1:49:32] Bible said leave them alone until time I
[1:49:34] harvest go chlorine argon so therefore
[1:49:38] Yaga rest within the stock remember God
[1:49:41] spoke to Abraham about Sarah bringing a
[1:49:43] child she adopted pass it on the Higa
[1:49:46] then he got on after three woman he got
[1:49:48] Sarah and Mary and then here come the
[1:49:50] manchild
[1:49:51] he said but Pentecost represent a Mary
[1:49:53] Mary the last teach of it she was not
[1:49:56] the seed yet the life of the seed was in
[1:49:58] her but it had matured yet
[1:50:00] it hadn't matured so when they like
[1:50:02] mature you have the pre-plea shotgun

[1:50:06] bane you stay there boy

[1:50:21] restoration of the gifts but the entire
[1:50:24] seed has to come forth and that is what

[2:05:27] speaking now the parable is this the
[2:05:31] seed is the word of God do it by the
[2:05:33] wayside I did it here then come at the
[2:05:36] devil and take it away the word out of
[2:05:37] their hearts Lisa should believe and be
[2:05:39] saved there on the rock a day which when
[2:05:42] they hear receive the word with joy
[2:05:43] these have no root for what for which
[2:05:46] for why believe in time of temptation
[2:05:47] following David fell among thorns a day
[2:05:50] which when they have heard go forth and
[2:05:53] a choked with cares and riches and
[2:05:55] pleasures of life and bring no fruit to
[2:05:58] perfection but that's on good ground are
[2:06:01] they which in an honest and good heart
[2:06:05] haven't heard a word keep it and bring
[2:06:08] forth fruit with patience there's Luke
[2:06:12] description Matthew description and 13
[2:06:14] treaty 11 says this and he spake many
[2:06:16] things unto them in parables saying
[2:06:17] behold I saw and for the show when he
[2:06:20] sowed some seeds fell by the wayside the
[2:06:21] falls came and devoured him up some fell
[2:06:24] upon stony places where they had not
[2:06:25] much as for 20 sprung up because they
[2:06:28] had no deepness of earth when the Sun
[2:06:31] was up they were scorched because they
[2:06:33] had no root they withered away some fell

[2:06:53] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[2:06:55] the kingdom of heaven but to them it is
[2:06:58] not given so the parable of the saw
[2:07:01] pictures the whole cost for this age is
[2:07:04] not right
[2:07:05] it shows the Word of God in different
