[13:17] it amen God bless you thanks for coming
[13:20] if you have your Bibles i' like you to
[13:22] turn to three portion of scripture
[13:23] Isaiah 59 1 verse verse 19 Acts chapter
[13:27] 4 we want to read read verse
[13:30] 23-31 and Ephesians 6
[13:33] 10-18 we want to look at
[13:36] Isaiah chapter 59:
[13:40] 19 so shall they fear the name of the
[13:43] Lord from the West and his glory from
[13:46] the rising of the sun when the enemy
[13:48] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[13:51] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[13:55] against
[13:56] him and reading from Acts chap 4: 23 and
[14:01] being let go this is after the Believers
[14:05] the the fathers were beaten Peter and
[14:07] all of them and being leted go they went
[14:10] to their own company and reported all
[14:12] that the chief priests and the elders
[14:13] had said unto them and when they heard
[14:16] that they lifted up their voice to God
[14:18] with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art
[14:21] God which ha made Heaven and Earth and
[14:23] the Sea and all that is that them is who
[14:25] by the mouth of thy servant David has
[14:27] said why did the hidden rage and the
[14:29] people imagine a vain thing the kings of
[14:32] the earth stood up and the rulers were
[14:33] gathered together against the Lord
[14:35] against his Christ for of a truth
[14:37] against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou
[14:39] has anointed both Herod and Pontius
[14:42] pilot with the Gentiles and the people
[14:44] of Israel will gather together for to do
[14:47] whatsoever thy hand and thy councel
[14:49] determined before to be done and now
[14:52] Lord behold their threatenings Grant
[14:54] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[14:58] they may speak Thy Word by stretching
[15:00] forth thine hand to heal and that signs
[15:04] and wonders may be done by the name of
[15:07] thy holy Child Jesus amen and when they
[15:09] had prayed the place was shaken where
[15:12] they were assembled together and they
[15:14] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[15:18] they spake the word of God with boldness
[15:21] our last scripture is from Ephesians
[15:23] chapter 6 reading from verse 10 finally
[15:26] my brethren be strong in the Lord in the
[15:28] power of His might and put on the whole
[15:30] armor of God that you may able to stand
[15:33] against the Ws of the devil for we Ras
[15:36] not against flesh and blood but against
[15:37] principalities against Powers against
[15:41] rulers of the darkness of this world
[15:44] against spiritual wickedness in high
[15:46] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[15:48] armor of God that you may be able to
[15:51] withstand in the evil day having done
[15:54] all to stand stand therefore having your
[15:56] loins good about with truth having on
[16:00] which is the word of God praying always
[16:04] with all prayer and
[16:08] supplication in the spirit and watching
[16:11] there unto with all perseverance and
[16:13] supplication for All Saints may God
[16:15] bless his word you may be seated oh
[16:17] praise God it's always a blessing to be
[16:20] in the house of God and to be in his
[16:21] presence where you can enjoy the Lord
[16:25] and enjoy and receive his word and get
[16:28] manner from heaven so we're looking for
[16:29] that fresh manner tonight that would
[16:31] feed our souls you love him amen oh
[16:34] praise the name of the Lord so Acts
[16:37] chapter
[16:38] 4 the amplifi said and they were
[16:40] permitted to go the apostles returned to
[16:42] their own
[16:43] company and told all what the chief
[16:45] priests and Elders had said to them and
[16:47] when they heard it they lifted up their
[16:48] voices together with one United mind to
[16:50] God said oh Sovereign
[16:52] Lord you are he who made the Heaven and
[16:55] Earth and the Sea and everything that is
[16:57] in them who by the mouth of for fathers
[16:59] David your servant and child said
[17:01] through the Holy Spirit why did the
[17:03] Heathen rage the Gentiles become want
[17:06] and insolent why did they rage and the
[17:09] people imagine and study a plan vain
[17:11] fruitless thing that will not succeed
[17:14] the king of the earth took their
[17:15] standing array for attack and the rulers
[17:17] were assembled and combined together
[17:19] against the Lord against his anointed
[17:21] Christ the Messiah for in this city they
[17:24] actually met and plotted together
[17:26] against your holy child and servant
[17:27] Jesus whom you consecrated by anointing
[17:30] both Herod and Pontius pilot with the
[17:32] Gentiles and the people of Israel to
[17:35] carry out all that your hand and your
[17:37] will and purpose had predestined
[17:39] predetermined should occur now Lord
[17:42] observe their threats and Grant to your
[17:44] bond servants full freedom to declare
[17:47] your message
[17:49] fearlessly while you stretch out your
[17:51] hand to cure and to perform signs and
[17:54] wonders through the authority and by the
[17:56] power of the name of your holy child and
[17:58] servant Jesus and when they had prayed
[18:00] the place in which they were assembled
[18:02] was shaken and they were filled with the
[18:05] Holy Spirit and they continue to speak
[18:08] the word of God with freedom and
[18:09] boldness and courage isn't that
[18:12] tremendous
[18:17] tonight that God could release such a
[18:19] power and this what we read tonight is
[18:22] our
[18:22] promise not just the acts two part but
[18:25] the acts four part the acts two was the
[18:29] filling but this year this is the
[18:31] refilling okay let's continue okay so
[18:33] tonight of a title when the enemy
[18:35] comeing like a flood the spirit raises a
[18:37] standard oh pray that's the word God can
[18:41] lie once any anytime the enemy come like
[18:44] a flood watch the spirit raise a
[18:46] standard amen so let's go the church has
[18:50] come through these schools she's married
[18:52] back y a long time ago and become a
[18:54] denomination but you notice the birth
[18:56] produced something else and now it's got
[18:59] to a place to where the Pentecostal
[19:01] church with the New Birth has been
[19:03] tested and tried now God here we go
[19:06] doesn't deal with the church as an
[19:12] organization God deals with the church
[19:15] as
[19:17] individuals each individual in the
[19:19] church so we can't put the church as
[19:22] this is something and this is it or
[19:23] whatever it is that's foolishness
[19:25] because God doesn't deal with church as
[19:27] a group
[19:28] he he deal with you as an individual he
[19:31] deals with Israel as a nation but you is
[19:34] an individual that me when you come to
[19:36] church tonight you're going to hear
[19:37] direct from God you you have to come to
[19:40] God to speak to you nobody else God
[19:42] talking to you what you have to do what
[19:45] you have to apply are you with me you
[19:49] deal with churches as individual each
[19:51] individual in the church now it's no
[19:55] secret we see it when a man proves and
[19:59] God loves him he takes him out somewhere
[20:03] to
[20:03] himself there in the front of angels he
[20:07] does something for him he lifts him up
[20:10] up there in the presence of God gives
[20:13] him fills him sets him out that's the
[20:18] age we're living
[20:19] in or you mean God going take men put
[20:23] him and call them by to
[20:26] himself give them fill them and send
[20:30] them out and when he sent them out it
[20:32] w't be word
[20:38] only you mean not the kind of we see now
[20:42] no not that kind let's say it again here
[20:45] now this is the age God will take men
[20:48] pull him pull them to
[20:50] themselves give them fill them send them
[20:55] out and when he send them out the Bible
[20:58] said the Lord himself went everywhere
[21:03] with
[21:04] them confirming the word that they
[21:08] preaching with signs with wonders with
[21:12] Miracles is not with a song service
[21:14] after the word preach it's not with a
[21:16] special after the word preach it's with
[21:19] signs it's with wonders it's with
[21:22] Miracles you mean that have to come back
[21:25] yes all this is part of what the father
[21:27] said yet all this is what the fathers
[21:30] had and whatever they had we going to
[21:33] have the same thing oh give the Lord a
[21:36] shout hallelujah the same holy spirit
[21:41] that saved the lutherans that Sanctified
[21:43] the methodists that baptized the

[41:44] they begin to pray and ask for they
[41:46] didn't ask for more word they didn't ask
[41:49] for more Mysteries they say oh Lord
[41:51] stretch forth your hand bring down some
[41:54] power that we could have Clarity and
[41:57] boldness to preach this message
[42:00] fearlessly and while they were praying

[42:06] fellowshipping while they were praying
[42:09] all of a sudden Lord Glory power Oh
[42:13] Glory my God I feel on fashion tonight
[42:17] my God I feel it for this thing tonight
[42:19] this is what is promise man you have to
[42:21] look for it we have to preach it for you
[42:23] to expect it if we don't preach it how
[42:26] you expect it if we don't say it how you
[42:28] going to look for it oh glory to God
[42:31] hallelujah praise God I am pointing you
[42:33] to what you is Promised for you this is
[42:36] your
[42:37] portion oh
[42:39] Hallelujah glory to God the spirit alone
[42:42] could bring Revelation that this will be
[42:45] your
[42:46] portion oh hallelujah praise God
[42:50] hallelujah am
[42:52] Hallelujah can I continue amen okay
[42:55] listen to this this is happened before
[42:57] Pentecost he give them power against
[42:59] unclean
[43:02] spirits so these deciples had power
[43:05] wasn't internal power wasn't resident
[43:09] power it was temporary power shout out
[43:13] temporary temporary so God can give
[43:15] temporary
[43:20] power who preaching
[43:23] that doesn't sound so nice
[43:26] because it ex it's exposing any
[43:28] temporary preachers right all right all
[43:31] right temporary
[43:35] fivefold what was promised was permanent
[43:40] power or resident
[43:44] power or aesan well power which is the
[43:49] power from within Jesus said it this way
[43:51] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[43:54] had said out of his belly shall flow
[43:56] rivers of Living Water this SP he of the
[43:59] Holy Ghost which they had not yet
[44:01] received come on now preach back to
[44:03] these are scriptures this is the
[44:05] scriptures this is the word of God so
[44:07] yet they were preaching yeah yet the
[44:09] kingdom is at hand casting out Devils
[44:11] they had temporary power but that is
[44:13] what was not promised because once that
[44:16] power move off them they backslid they a
[44:20] condition they in frustration they in
[44:23] tears they Under Pressure because the
[44:25] power is not yet within they have the
[44:27] potential but it's not yet within Oh
[44:30] Glory to God I will not leave you
[44:31] comfortless I will come to you this wild
[44:34] will see at me no more but you going to
[44:35] see me he's not talking about physical
[44:38] come on now give the Lord a shout he
[44:39] said the comforter is with you but shall
[44:41] be in you but I can't be in you like
[44:46] this it has to be
[44:48] converted he said if I don't go I be
[44:50] comforter can't come so don't try to
[44:53] hold me here I got to
[44:54] go
[45:01] so Jesus himself was pointing them to a
[45:06] dead
[45:06] end he was pointing them to the end of
[45:10] self because Moses came to a dead end
[45:13] and Joshua cross
[45:15] over Jesus came to a dead end and the
[45:18] Holy Ghost took them over see you have
[45:22] to come to a dead end because this is
[45:24] not the tree of knowledge where you try
[45:26] to intellectualize and figure out
[45:27] everything and explain everything
[45:29] Hallelujah it has to be the portion now
[45:31] where is the tree of life that crosses
[45:34] you into the spirit and as men as are
[45:36] led by the spirit of God they are the
[45:38] sons of God this is not a letter message
[45:42] this is from the bosom of the spirit of
[45:44] God the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[45:46] visited the church to reveal all Seven
[45:49] Seals and the Seven SE is to bring back
[45:51] the Holy Ghost itself back among God's
[45:54] people all everybody know God was with
[45:56] William brandham and God used William
[45:58] brandham but the Bible said he shall
[46:00] turn the hearts of the children back to
[46:02] the face of the father he had a job he
[46:04] did it he actually restored the faith
[46:07] what has to happen now that faith has to
[46:09] be activated in a bride to confirm the
[46:11] restoration of the faith we not trying
[46:14] to restore original the faith has been
[46:16] restored it has been confirmed by a
[46:18] prophet so now we have to get that same
[46:21] confirmation Oh Glory to God in other
[46:24] words we are identified with the message
[46:26] but the hour has come where the message
[46:28] have to be identified with
[46:30] us that's two different
[46:35] things that's two different things I
[46:38] love the prophet I love the message I
[46:39] love the word I believe the word all
[46:41] that is you love that and you believe
[46:42] that and you seeing that and you unfold
[46:44] that and you have reation of that that's
[46:46] good but when God said this is my
[46:48] beloved Son that's a different talk Al
[46:51] together there no message talk there no
[46:52] book talk that is the father Hallelujah
[46:56] Oh Glory to God the father's approval to
[46:59] call Sons and Daughters aside if you see
[47:02] that you could run tonight if you see
[47:04] that you could pray tonight if you see
[47:06] that nobody could stop you from reaching
[47:08] out in the spirit Oh Glory to God to
[47:11] pull down your portion Oh Glory to God

[59:33] spirit and not baptizing your soul am so
[59:37] the context of that is where you get
[59:38] that
[59:39] baptism so Peter and them didn't say I
[59:42] have you seed in my soul I don't need no

[59:56] run just as fast as when he Deni Jesus
[59:59] Christ because he will have he'll be a
[1:00:01] man who the world open to he understand
[1:00:03] open but he have no power so when them

[1:01:10] wonderful Revelation that you ever had
[1:01:12] in your life to see you must do it oh

[1:01:43] to raise up a standard of his own word
[1:01:47] against the enemy and the Bible said
[1:01:50] when the enemy come like a flood the
[1:01:52] spirit raised the standard what does he

[1:07:10] time so in other words the word has been
[1:07:13] restored but we have to come back to the
[1:07:16] Pentecostal part
[1:07:19] amen which is what is the
[1:07:22] original the cal part is the power part
[1:07:26] the spirit part 1906 they thought that
[1:07:29] was the
[1:07:31] Dynamics that was only a spiritual
[1:07:33] awakening amen hallelujah way in the
[1:07:36] womb that's why the Mysteries could be
[1:07:38] revealed to them he said because they
[1:07:40] were only begotten that mean the
[1:07:42] Pentecost was still in the
[1:07:44] womb hallu so William brandham was sent
[1:07:47] to reveal the very person of God which
[1:07:50] is the person of the Holy Ghost so
[1:07:53] whereas the Pentecost 96 had the birth
[1:07:55] he brought the very person and he
[1:07:56] revealed the person of Christ look at
[1:07:59] there compare it consists of seven Parts
[1:08:04] the very person of God and that is what
[1:08:06] has to come inside of you the very
[1:08:09] person of
[1:08:11] Christ so he said here now when come
[1:08:13] like a flood he raised the standard
[1:08:15] against it watch and Eden he gave them
[1:08:16] his word for their armor just the word
[1:08:18] spoke then the enemy came like a flood
[1:08:21] he took the word and made it flesh to
[1:08:23] dwell on among us a little stronger here
[1:08:26] he's walking on the earth going to call
[1:08:27] me Ho Holy anyhow first it was spoken
[1:08:30] with out yonder now here it is you could
[1:08:33] touch it it's made flesh and then when
[1:08:36] the enemy come like a flood he pour the
[1:08:38] word into the person Hallelujah be in
[1:08:40] the form of the Holy Ghost hallu so in
[1:08:44] Eden was just word the day you eat
[1:08:46] thereof that day you die just word stay
[1:08:47] behind the word then he raised his
[1:08:49] standard and bring the word to become
[1:08:51] flesh this is Jesus then he raise a
[1:08:54] higher standard and bring the word
[1:08:55] inside the people and to do that he had
[1:08:58] to convert it into
[1:09:03] spirit so word coming to you is not head
[1:09:06] knowledge it's not information it's not
[1:09:08] how much you know about the message and
[1:09:09] about the Peaks and about this and about
[1:09:11] the angels and how the angel wings s
[1:09:13] back and so on that's not that that's
[1:09:14] right that's not word in you that word
[1:09:15] you could
[1:09:18] talk that's what they can explain but
[1:09:21] when that word becomes Spirit that's you
[1:09:23] that comes into
[1:09:27] you let's
[1:09:29] continue he took the word okay let's go
[1:09:32] so first it was the spoken word of Y
[1:09:34] here it is you could touch it then it
[1:09:35] could become flesh and when enemy come
[1:09:37] in like a flood he poured the word into
[1:09:39] the person being the form of the Holy
[1:09:40] Ghost there you are 1 2 three
[1:09:42] justification sanctification baptism
[1:09:45] Holy Ghost so forth imperfection notice
[1:09:48] the spoken word God above us amen God
[1:09:51] with
[1:09:52] us then God in
[1:09:55] US God's Army marching on God's spoken

[1:10:28] it takes the hidden power of the spirit
[1:10:30] of

[1:10:35] like Peter he was good with his sword
[1:10:37] when Jesus got in trouble he pulled out
[1:10:39] his sword he could flop anywhere and cut
[1:10:41] the high priest's servant air off with a
[1:10:43] sword but when it come to real Christian
[1:10:45] Courage he didn't have
[1:10:47] it so with all what Peter had and Jesus
[1:10:50] coming and the the priest coming he draw
[1:10:53] a sword cut out in Priest ears Jesus to
[1:10:56] pick up the ears and put it back and
[1:10:57] heal it one time man unbeliever can heal
[1:11:00] one time yes instant
[1:11:04] Miracle but he didn't have the Christian
[1:11:07] Courage oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus
[1:11:11] Hallelujah so he failed right there why

[1:24:39] be an effectual wit of his resurrection
[1:24:41] he know it would take the Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] because man cannot do those things do
[1:24:46] those things not talk those things not
[1:24:49] preach those things do those things oh
[1:24:51] give the Lord some Praises
[1:24:55] Hallelujah course man can't do those
[1:24:57] things he he equipped his army with the

[1:25:03] promised you can't do that with any kind
[1:25:05] of a training you got to do it by the
[1:25:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost the armor of
[1:25:09] God and this is the even light to make
[1:25:12] Hebrews 138 a
[1:25:14] reality then it will take more than a
[1:25:16] training you can read words and read
[1:25:18] words and read words but it will never
[1:25:20] come to pass until you have the Holy
[1:25:21] Ghost there to manifest that I didn't
[1:25:24] say it he said it three times you could
[1:25:26] read words you could read words you
[1:25:27] could read words but it will take the
[1:25:29] Holy Ghost to take them words and make
[1:25:31] it bring it come to pass that's the
[1:25:34] light put on the whole armor of God not
[1:25:36] just a dress only and dress up and say
[1:25:38] glory to God I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:40] then splitting all the power out with
[1:25:41] whistle you're not doing no good put it
[1:25:44] into action put it in faith make it move
[1:25:48] make it do something put down the whole
[1:25:51] armor of God to go out and withstand the
[1:25:53] Ws of the devil Oh Glory to God you
[1:25:57] think I act funny maybe I am I've lost
[1:25:59] my mind to the world and found it in
[1:26:01] Christ let that mind was in Christ be in
[1:26:03] you it takes the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost the whole armor of God not just to
[1:26:07] shake hands with the preacher put your
[1:26:09] name on the book or take some kusher and

[1:26:31] to back it up oh glory to God he said
[1:26:34] I've got plenty more I ain't going to
[1:26:35] say brother the whole armor of God is
[1:26:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the
[1:26:39] word behind it if anybody says they got
[1:26:41] the Holy Ghost and and and and deny one
[1:26:44] word it's not the Holy Ghost because the
[1:26:47] Holy Ghost will accept and believe and
[1:26:48] confirm the word okay I'm finished now
[1:26:51] mus come up please
[1:26:54] Hallelujah now the big machine is
[1:26:55] setting up there ready to move the
[1:26:58] mechanics is already there they got the
[1:27:01] mechanical system of organization the
[1:27:03] United Nations the nations are united
[1:27:06] together it's United time I preached it
[1:27:08] the United Nations is nothing but a big
[1:27:10] rubber
[1:27:11] balloon that's carried about with every
[1:27:13] nation's wi of Doctrine it will bust and
[1:27:15] blow up at anything it can't work
[1:27:17] neither can the Council of churches work
[1:27:19] it's an organization by man contrary to
[1:27:22] the system watch the other great
[1:27:25] churches the Pentecostal Kingdom the
[1:27:27] Full Gospel people how can they forfeit
[1:27:29] the Evangelical teachings the very
[1:27:31] principles they stood for they will have
[1:27:32] to Forfeit their Evangelical Doctrine to
[1:27:34] walk into man who disagree with the
[1:27:36] principles of the Bible yes there you
[1:27:39] are that's the hour we have arrived at
[1:27:41] that's the big machine that's set up
[1:27:43] they have got the mechanics they have
[1:27:46] the mechanics so have we listen the only
[1:27:50] thing they have to have is Satan in
[1:27:52] there with the Dynamics to force the
[1:27:55] marking of the Beast what do we say
[1:27:58] about two Services back National Force
[1:28:00] with Israel in Homeland National Force
[1:28:02] will put the churches in the work and
[1:28:03] churches but the power of God will put
[1:28:06] the people in the bright not a minister
[1:28:08] not teaching not preaching but the power
[1:28:11] so the power is what is Promised Oh
[1:28:13] Glory to God do we believe that
[1:28:16] Hallelujah glory to God so now the only
[1:28:19] thing you have to have is Satan in there
[1:28:21] with Dynamics
[1:28:22] so brother it you being United Nations
[1:28:25] waiting for Dynamics to enforce the laws
[1:28:27] of course Dynamics going to bring to
[1:28:30] pass and make manifest everything it is
[1:28:33] when she is forced down then the
[1:28:35] Dynamics is working the mechanics is
[1:28:38] there they already got them let me say
[1:28:41] something too this uniting time to see
[1:28:43] churches uniting Nations uniting it's
[1:28:46] United time of God this bride too and I
[1:28:48] say this with reverence and respect I
[1:28:50] believe the bride of Christ is called
[1:28:53] she is sealed in the kingdom of God
[1:28:55] hallelujah so he is saying it and he's
[1:28:57] prophesying I believe the mechanics is
[1:29:00] there they are waiting for the
[1:29:03] Dynamics what the bride is waiting for
[1:29:06] what the bride is waiting
[1:29:07] for what the B is waiting for he said
[1:29:10] they are waiting for dynamics that will
[1:29:12] take her off the earth into glory and
[1:29:13] the Rapture I believe with all my heart
[1:29:15] we don't know how he's going to do it
[1:29:17] but he shall do
[1:29:18] it how why because he is the dynamic
[1:29:25] so you mean a bishop is not a Dynamics
[1:29:27] right a message a pastor is not the
[1:29:30] Dynamics he is the Dynamics we become
[1:29:33] members of the machine of his
[1:29:35] body forming ourselves into his image
[1:29:39] and see him uniting himself with his us
[1:29:41] with his works and his love gifts he
[1:29:44] this part as he hands them to us just
[1:29:46] before the wedding
[1:29:48] supper the church is reunited I'm
[1:29:51] finished last quotes the Dynamics of
[1:29:54] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:29:58] holy
[1:29:59] spirit that we have worked in a small
[1:30:02] measure while The Headstone is coming
[1:30:04] down to unite with the body but when the
[1:30:08] head and body unites together the full
[1:30:10] power of the Holy Ghost would raise her
[1:30:12] up exactly like that even the dead that
[1:30:15] dead in Christ 100 years ago will rise
[1:30:18] in the beautiful Holiness and take the
[1:30:20] flight to the skies the Dynamics is the
[1:30:22] holy spirit that's why I WR read acts 4
[1:30:26] the Dynamics is acts 4 acts 4 is
[1:30:30] possible because they had the acts two
[1:30:32] they were filled and then they had to be
[1:30:35] refilled the Dynamics of this church
[1:30:38] would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:42] before you refilled you have to be
[1:30:44] filled oh Hallelujah are you looking for
[1:30:47] that Filling tonight could we to play
[1:30:49] and just stand and just Worship the Lord
