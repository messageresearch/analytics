tonight as we go on to pray father in your precious name with Thanksgiving amen and amen praise God so God bless each and every one of you amen listen to our Bibles in John chapter 5. this is one to name praise the Lord amen amen praise God amen so let's go after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem nowadays A Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent Folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an Infinity 30 and 8 years and when Jesus saw him lie I knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made cool the important man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step it down before me Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took off his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath praise the name of the Lord father blessed with our hearts tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord even just a few words tonight amen so coming out from Brother Anthony's message when God stays it was a real blessing amen when God stays and we see that God moves in times when God moves and Seasons amen praise God and one time he said when the day of Pentecost was fully come and they were in one Accord then the Holy Ghost came amen so he waits till the time is right he moves when the season is right can we say Amen praise the name of the Lord and for example first of all sharing this here I have a mango tree and one time the tree is big there's absolutely nothing on the tree no mangoes WhatsApp but once the season sets in they are mangoes Galore every morning I have to pick up mangoes on the ground amen mango season has settled another example I was looking at the dry season and the rainy season and one day the sun is patching hot the the the the grass is brown and dry but the very next day when as the season moves in we get rain to cause flooding totally baffling it's all about this season and the time can we say Amen praise God I can't imagine in the UK and the North American countries and in other places when the winter time comes around you have to adjust you cannot say I want more summertime I am feeling to stay in the heat you will get wiped out amen so when the season changes you have to adjust you have to shift how you do things amen ready or not the season will change and nature Works in season and God has set it up that way amen can we say Amen praise God in Ecclesiastes chapter 3. we see that there's a time for all things to everything there's a season and a Time a time to born a time to die a time to plant a time to reap a time to break down a time to build up amen a time to weep A Time To Laugh everything goes in seasons and times praise God so all these things are in a natural but some of these laws apply to spiritual things as well amen God is a god of seasons there's a season of Revival there's a season of adoption are you looking for it tonight Hallelujah there's a Time of Deliverance there's a time for your healing how many ones you're healing tonight you don't have your mind healing of your body healing of your soul healing of your spirit there's a time of healing praise God Amen there's a time for your ceiling unto the day of our Redemption amen can we say Amen a time of sequence there's a time of restoration Hallelujah and we must understand that the times and Seasons exist and we have to work with them we have to work with the seasons and we have to work with the times amen and brother would often say that the anointing when it comes it is not just to say I feel the anointing or I feel good but it is a time of refreshing is a time for you to understand for you to enter in and receive your portion the anointing comes for a purpose praise God does not visit without a purpose can we say Amen can we say Amen when he comes look out you say you tell him speak Lord here I am praise God just look out when he comes hallelujah praise God Amen one songwriter says when Jesus comes the tempt us power is broken praise God hallelujah broken broken amen broken today Hallelujah he could break every chain tonight hallelujah amen when Jesus comes all fear is wiped away amen love pass away fear he says fear not to desire fear not little bride only believe amen when Jesus comes all fear is Cast Away only believe praise God when Jesus comes and maybe tonight he can visit us we can visit you wherever you are in your home in your situation each of you wherever you are you could visit you tonight when Jesus comes and may He raise us up into a higher place can we say Amen tonight hallelujah hallelujah praise God blessed be the name of the Lord don't look around he's here be sensitive because you can miss your visitation if you are not sensitive if you are not alert when he comes for example if the minister says stand up and receive your healing and you decide to look around or to go to the washroom you can miss your opportunity right there if the minister said raise your hand and give him praise and you say I'm not doing that I'm feeling tired tonight or I would do it when I feel too you can miss your opportunity right there amen why would you wait five years for your healing and when it comes you are not sensitive to the movement of the spirit simple instruction and you miss it and you don't obey you can miss your opportunity then we say Amen so we need to be alert we need to be sensitive to when God moves amen so help us Lord tonight when God stays when God moves we got to be ready we need to be a little amen you have a need but keep looking keep waiting stay focused because God is going to move God is about to stay but we have to be focused we have to be looking can we say Amen tonight oh glory to God yes Lord God will trouble the waters and you have to be alert you have to be looking for when the angel steals the water you have to be ready to dash in can we say Amen you have to be ready to dash in amen Elijah told Elijah if if you see me go you will get your heart's desire so I can see Elisha looking staring at Elijah focus on Elijah Oh Glory to God mosquitoes buzzing and biting but Elisha is not moving his eyes if you see me go he recognized he was in a season of the transfer of power Brothers I would say a season of the transfer of power so he stayed focused on Elijah so there's no time to play it's time to focus praise God if you see me go so you have to be looking you have to be alert when that angel comes to troubling water is the first man who enter and get sin so if you're not looking if you're not alert what will happen to you Jacob with the angel I will not let you go until you bless me he was in a time of Deliverance and he recognized the urgency of this situation it was now or never he had to do something he had to do something I need to get empowered to deal with what's coming next something is coming next a great Challenge and I need to be empowered and when the season comes you have to seize the moment you have to grab a hold of it don't let it pass you by so we are waiting on the season of Revival you're waiting on adoption be alert praise God put a mark on those who sigh and cry for the Holy Ghost put a mark and those who sigh and cry for the Abomination around you praise God waiting present amen glory to God Amen grab a hold of it amen so until that season comes beyond the expectation you look outfit and be focused Dash into that anointing to receive your portion Hallelujah it is not for the lazy it is not very thoughtful it is so get on fire forgotten I give you a lot of praise tonight get on fire for all let's get on fire for God tonight Hallelujah praise God praise God so Saint John chapter 5. at the pool of Bethesda a great multitude of impotent folk lay there what Abraham said crippled lame blind halt withered twisted up people impotentful diseased Folk one place he said hundreds of them gathered in the five torches around the pool laying there waiting on a season on a season yes a season waiting on a season lying there just waiting on a season at a certain season an angel would go down into the pool and Trouble the water still up the water and whoever went in first after the angel would be healed just one sick person would be healed in that season what a situation suppose you were the sixth year person in the line would you stay knowing that you don't stand a chance of getting it or would you go away suppose it was once ahead of the angel came to trouble the water what would you do see so when the angel came and the people and the person went in and got healed but Ram said it was a miracle once you get into that water first you would be healed it was a miracle of healing babram said in message expectation The Virtue from the angel went into the prison and they were healed then the people waited for another season bye-bye waiting on a season waiting on the season there's something about waiting on this season in expectation on the expectation waiting waiting for that angel waiting for that angel looking out for the angel to dash in you can imagine if you're waiting looking all around and you might miss the injury Bank come and pass you by and put this news looking well that will enter in maybe tonight the angel would stood up the waters around your life and give you a miracle what is it that you have need of tonight is it a great break breakthrough in prayer is it that you want some victory in your life is it that you want overcoming Grace overcoming strength what is it that you have need of tonight Hallelujah and the prophet carried away with him for years our heaviness in this Spirit whatever I'm saying as if he had done something wrong he asked God over and over he tried to pray about it he tried to make everything all right the best he knew how but it never left him until one day when he walked with God then it was lifted after years so God works in seasons and times don't underestimate it can somebody say hallelujah tonight praise God praise God praise God Amen not one thing can happen before the season comes and before the time is right so you got to have patience with God and you have to have patience with yourself but the miracle is on its way give the Lord a hundred praise tonight Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus the many men have patience with God have patience with yourself tonight from the message God and his people God and his people but Ram says he always works in a miraculous way with signs and wonders he promised them in these last days and we are living in the last days we got a right to expect them expect what miracles why he says to bring his people together to increase our faith praise God praise God so he's God still performs Miracles can we say Amen tonight can we say Amen tonight he is still a miracle working God Hallelujah I wish somebody would believe that today that God still works miracle and tonight we are believing for our precious brother Micah that God would work a miracle for him even in that hospital bed and Mount Hope tonight praise God and little Alex in the hospital praise God that God will do a miracle tonight because we believe in miracle and he's a miracle Wicked God Hebrews 13 18 is tell the same yesterday today and forever praise God amen hallelujah amen we are believing for brother Micah tonight glory to God so in closing off but tonight this is what I want you to see before we go down to pray I'm not sure if I can see it just right there were hundreds of people of impotent folk at the pool all of them would like to be healed all of them waiting to get into the pool when the angel troubled the water but this certain man he was a paralytic he had an infirmity for 38 years and there was no one there was no way he could get into the pool by himself broadly kindness did not apply there because everybody wants to get into the pool first to be healed when everybody waiting to be healed see everybody trying to get in first you can't say well you know that's what I said so beautifully brought out some time ago but he kept on coming very time maybe he stayed right there I don't know 38 years which is infirmity Lord could it be my time Lord I need a healing but there's no one to put me in the pool Lord It's 38 years I'm here help me Lord he told himself there it is he told himself I am staying right here because this is the place where there is a possibility that I can be healed I am still right here I'm going anyway because this is the place where there's a possibility for my healing is there a possibility tonight then I'm staying right here I'm not moving because this is the place where there's a possibility that I can be healed amen he had some kind of faith because the faith reached the father blind batimias cried out in faith I need help Jesus helped me tonight hallelujah what around says he cried out loudly but Jesus was so frightened could not have heard about tibia's it was his feet that reached across that Jesus prayed Hallelujah but this impotent man his feet touched the father his fate moved the father and the father sent Jesus to him Oh Glory to God Glory when the son of man cometh shall he find faith God is looking for faith it is faith that moves the hand of God it is faith that moves God so his feet touched the father and the father sent Jesus to him Here Comes Jesus full of compassion but going only where the father sent him doing only what the father showed him to do and nothing else full of compassion oh hallelujah praise God praise God here brother from the message the pool of Bethesda Jesus when he passed there he saw a great multitude he had all the power of God in him he could have healed every person there but he was a true prophet he only did what the father showed him to do instead of saying anything to them he healed one man not a but a man that had an infirmity for 38 years he healed him and walked away and left the great multitude of people laying there oh my God why did he do that next message they always come for LeBron Jesus passed by hundreds of people and walk right on by them because they didn't have the faith to be healed you see why he passed them he walked past the multitude and healed one man that had an infirmity so it's connected to Faith his faith reached a father and the father sent Jesus to him so tonight your faith can touch the father can we say Amen can we see him in tonight your feet can't touch your father Oh Glory to God glory glory glory glory this man's feet touch God that's God 38 years he held on believing because he stayed there he said there's a possibility I'm staying right here I'm going nowhere I can't get into the water but I stayed right here this is the place where the possibility lies this is the place where the angel troubling the water in this area right here and he's staying right there I can't get into the water but this is the place where the possibility is somehow he would get healed he didn't know how he didn't know him but he held on and his feet God honored his feet God honored his faith listen his faith and attitude was so outstanding that while the others were waiting in line to go after the angel in the pool his feet moved the father and instead of going to the angel deity came walking to him hallelujah praise God praise God praise God let me see that one more time while the others were waiting in line to go after the angel into the pool his fate movie the father and the father said Jesus directly to him and hundreds of people laying by the pool deity came to him the others were going to the age of the following the pool but God came to this man hallelujah hallelujah this man had Jesus come directly to him by passing all the others will thou be made whole will you be made whole one person you the individual do you want to be whole do you want to be healed tonight take up your bed and walk give him another person right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah party man thank you Jesus so this was his time this was his season of Deliverance this was his time for divine encounter his feet your fate tonight can move the hand of God we could see that tonight if we could see that tonight his feet according heaven and God sent his son to minister of virtue directly to him no glory to God not just blessed my heart so much amen others lining up doing the normal thing reaching for the angel to enter in his feet reach heaven and God sent the father send Jesus directly to him he didn't even have to go anywhere amen God came straight to him amen so tonight as we pray God can visit you directly and answer your prayer everything in the Bible is for Learning and for admonition and here it is we see this example this example that God can visit us directly and answer our prayer to me you will bypass all those without faith and come directly to you so it's connected to Faith faith is what moves the hand of God faith in God and my title tonight was God sees your faith and he will respond in the right time and season God sees your faith and he will respond in the right time and Caesar and tonight we say your season is come so as we go down to pray tonight say Lord This Is My Season as we pray This Is My Season Lord and He will surely visit us tonight praise God so God bless you tonight this is your season This Is My Season
