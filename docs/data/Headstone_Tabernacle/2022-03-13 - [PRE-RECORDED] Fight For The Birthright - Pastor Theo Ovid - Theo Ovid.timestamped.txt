[29:00] oh praise god
[29:02] revelation 2 8 and all that dwell upon
[29:04] the earth shall worship him who is him
[29:06] not christ
[29:08] that's the beast
[29:09] whose names are not written in the book
[29:11] of life of the lamb staying from the
[29:12] foundation of the world so everybody is
[29:14] going to worship
[29:15] all man jacques they say going to
[29:17] worship
[29:18] hallelujah they're going to worship
[29:20] something worship your wife worship your
[29:22] money worship your house worship your
[29:24] car you're going to worship something oh
[29:26] that fellaini are going to worship the
[29:28] beast
[29:28] except
[29:30] those names written
[29:32] that means there's a bunch of people
[29:33] that anger worship and no beast
[29:36] whatever form that beast coming
[29:38] no worship for him oh glory to god we're
[29:41] talking about all them fancy actors
[29:44] we're talking about all the presidents
[29:45] the popes the potentials all of them
[29:47] worship and the beast we talking about
[29:49] who is millionaire and building here we
[29:51] talk about who high who low pour burn
[29:53] free if the name is not written to
[29:55] worship the beast
[29:57] if your name is on the book who you
[29:58] gonna worship
[29:59] jesus told the woman well we know what
[30:02] we worship
[30:03] he said he our command always
[30:05] we're the true worshippers not just
[30:08] worshippers
[30:09] but the true worshipers
[30:11] are you are true worshipper
[30:13] where the true worshippers will worship
[30:16] the father
[30:17] in spirit
[30:19] and in truth
[30:21] all glory to god
[30:23] glory to god
[30:25] in spirit
[30:27] and in truth
[30:28] and jesus said my word the word that i
[30:31] speak unto you
[30:33] they are spirit
[30:34] and their life
[30:36] but when the church lost the word in the
[30:39] early ages the spirit couldn't come up
[30:41] on patwood
[30:43] the spirit couldn't anoint that word in
[30:45] that way
[30:46] the spirit was waiting until all the
[30:49] truth will come together
[30:50] all glory to god because the word and
[30:53] spirit is one so god was written all
[30:56] along for a prophet to come on the scene
[30:59] to gather all the scattered words to tie
[31:02] up all the loose ends
[31:04] that the entire holy ghost could visit
[31:07] the church
[31:08] oh give the lord a shout
[31:11] this is what this is about
[31:13] this is what this is about not
[31:15] explanation and interpretation this is
[31:18] for the entire holy ghost oh glory to
[31:20] god
[31:21] to visit the church
[31:32] the entire holy ghost
[31:36] that's why that's why the pentecostal
[31:38] signs and wonders but william branham
[31:40] had the fullness
[31:42] of signs and wonders
[31:44] that's a big difference all together
[31:46] hallelujah they never had a revival like
[31:49] azusa street because rosa street was for

[31:56] that was jesus christ coming back
[31:58] to reveal himself to elect
[32:00] shall i hide from abraham what i'm about

[32:05] entire world and wouldn't come to reveal
[32:07] to us
[32:08] his secret
[32:10] and we are heirs of the earth
[32:12] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[32:15] give the lord a shout in the house

[34:16] to iron and clay
[34:18] but then he saw a stone cut out without
[34:20] the hands of man
[34:22] and william branham came to bring the
[34:24] fate
[34:25] to catch that stone it would take a
[34:27] faith to catch that stone not an
[34:29] intellectual fate but a real fate and
[34:32] jesus a question when the son of man
[34:34] cometh
[34:35] shall we find faith on the earth not

[51:10] and i beheld another beast coming out of
[51:12] the earth you have two horns like a lamb
[51:14] and he speak like a dragon
[51:17] so don't watch the horn
[51:19] watch how he's speaking
[51:22] and he exercises all the power of the
[51:24] first piece before him
[51:25] and quarter the earth and them which
[51:27] dwell in the worship the first peace
[51:28] whose deadly wound was healed
[51:31] he do what great wonders
[51:33] so you make it fire come from heaven on
[51:35] the earth in the sight of men
[51:37] deceive them that dwell on the earth by
[51:39] the means of those miracles which he had
[51:41] power to do
[51:43] in the sight of the beast saying to them
[51:44] that dwell in the earth that they should
[51:46] make an image to the visa which had
[51:47] wound by a sword and did live
[51:49] and he had power here we go to give life
[51:52] unto the image of the beast
[51:54] hallelujah
[51:55] there's an image of the beast
[51:57] there's the image of god
[51:59] the prophet came to reveal the image of
[52:01] god
[52:02] that will be in our bride
[52:04] power have to come into the image of the
[52:06] beast
[52:07] for the beast to live
[52:08] power have to come to the image of god
[52:10] for that image to live
[52:12] that power is spirit that power is
[52:15] dynamic
[52:16] everything is written for the spirit
[52:18] because the spirit is going to bring up
[52:19] every seed because every seed must bring
[52:22] forth after it's kind even the beast
[52:24] seed
[52:25] oh give the lord a shout
[52:28] oh give the lord a shout
[52:30] do you understand this power that is
[52:32] coming is not just for you
[52:34] it's for every seed on the earth
[52:36] los angeles sinking as a seed
[52:39] so i have to fall on that seed for los
[52:41] angeles
[52:43] you are a seed
[52:44] fire the fall on you
[52:46] for you to produce

[52:54] going to bring order of the sky
[53:00] maybe season
[53:02] because at all
[53:04] all
[53:05] both
[53:06] small and great
[53:08] rich and poor
[53:10] free unborn
[53:11] to receive a mark in the right hand or
[53:14] in their foreheads that no man might buy
[53:16] or sell see if he had the mark or the
[53:18] name of the beast or the name of his
[53:19] name
[53:20] and here's the wisdom and so on 666. now
[53:23] remember
[53:24] it was imperial pagan rome that fell by
[53:26] the sword but she was healed of a death
[53:29] stroke when she joined the nominal
[53:32] christian church of rome and
[53:33] incorporated paganism and christianity
[53:36] and thereby became the holy roman empire
[53:40] so this matching room with swords and
[53:42] everything else by connecting with
[53:44] christianity became the holy
[53:47] roman empire
[53:49] which was to endure
[53:50] until jesus came and destroyed her
[53:54] but rome is not going it alone her
[53:56] daughters are right with her
[53:58] and she will take over
[54:00] absolute authority by the welcomes of
[54:03] churches
[54:04] listen this may seem farfetched to some
[54:08] but actually it is very plain for all to
[54:11] see because right now
[54:13] the churches are controlling politics
[54:16] and at the opportune time will manifest
[54:19] exactly how great is that control
[54:21] this economical move will end up in rome
[54:25] at the head
[54:26] even though the people did not envision
[54:28] it that way
[54:30] this is so
[54:31] because revelation 17 36 it states that
[54:34] the mystery babylon is seated on
[54:37] the beast
[54:38] she is controlling the last
[54:40] or fought empire the roman church is
[54:43] doing that with the world church system
[54:46] under her room will be controlling and
[54:48] this image or church system will be the
[54:50] obedient to rome because rome controls
[54:53] the gold of the world
[54:56] and you know but i'm already already
[54:57] prophesied they will go back to the gold
[54:59] standard
[55:00] does all the people have to belong to
[55:03] the world church system
[55:05] or be at the mercy of the elements for
[55:08] they cannot buy or sell without the mark
[55:11] of the beast in the hand or head
[55:13] this mark in the head means that they
[55:16] will have to take the doctrine of the
[55:17] world system which is trinitarianism and
[55:20] the mark in the hand which means to do
[55:22] the will of the world church
[55:24] with this great power the church system
[55:27] will persecute the true bride
[55:30] that's a prophecy
[55:32] so if you think you will sit down in
[55:34] church and think you will go in the
[55:35] rapture and body change i hear people
[55:38] understand that now body change
[55:40] and i only think about before the body
[55:42] change
[55:46] are we going to be perfect
[55:48] are we going to have a statue of a
[55:49] perfect man
[55:51] so if you think you're going to sit down
[55:52] there and everything will be just work
[55:54] out and come to jesus everything will be
[55:56] all right no something to the water
[55:57] something in the flood something to get
[55:58] tried but all go go to the blood
[56:03] are you saying amen
[56:05] i hope i hope you're saying amen to this
[56:07] you know
[56:10] i know when pressure said that when he
[56:12] said the turner people would say i ain't
[56:13] signed up for this well if you stand for
[56:15] this is half a room
[56:17] you sign up to worship the be system is
[56:19] either this or that
[56:21] if god didn't send our prophet we
[56:22] couldn't know this
[56:26] all also you're still in your baptist
[56:28] church catholic church pentecostal
[56:29] church look at this church you're
[56:31] stealing whatever church it was in
[56:33] but causing a message
[56:35] for you to escape
[56:37] you are an escape one you escape room
[56:40] you escape the pope you escape the beast
[56:42] system
[56:44] and you can shout
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:53] [Music]
[56:56] [Applause]
[56:57] millions were lost when god called you
[57:01] you are one in a million
[57:03] you are one in a million
[57:05] you hear me don't wait for your wife to
[57:06] shout you shout by yourself

[57:18] your name is on that book
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:37] with this great power
[57:39] the church
[57:40] systems
[57:42] will persecute the true bride
[57:44] the image this image
[57:47] will try to keep the bride from
[57:50] preaching and teaching
[57:52] her ministers will be for forbidden to
[57:55] give comfort and truth to the people who
[57:57] need it
[57:59] but around even prophesy they will shut
[58:00] down the churches
[58:03] and make them store houses
[58:05] know that looking far-fetched but that's
[58:06] going to come to pass
[58:08] because he has said say that because he
[58:10] predicted he see that because you see a
[58:11] vision of that
[58:16] but before the antichrist in person
[58:20] because like a great spirit at work
[58:22] before the antichrist in person
[58:25] takes over this complete world system of
[58:28] churches the true church
[58:30] will be taken away from this world
[58:32] to be with the lord god will cut away
[58:35] his bride for the great marriage support

[1:01:26] you have a book or not that's not what i

[1:07:03] in the camp and i want to bring us back
[1:07:05] this morning
[1:07:08] as it was to be the age
[1:07:11] in which the true church

[1:07:15] to being
[1:07:16] the bride she was at pentecost
[1:07:21] i want you to weigh every word that's
[1:07:22] been spoken
[1:07:24] the church break at the 20th century
[1:07:28] because it was the age to retain back
[1:07:30] the bride
[1:07:31] bride is pentecost
[1:07:33] after pentecost was just falling away
[1:07:36] so when we say bribe we talk about alpha
[1:07:37] church

[1:07:41] and the life is in between
[1:07:43] we should have a corn tree here i want
[1:07:45] to do some demos inside of here
[1:07:47] and have a look one plant here shooting

[1:08:02] god put a seed in pentecost and they
[1:08:03] pick out
[1:08:04] plus some what the but how do i come
[1:08:06] back to your original seed at the top
[1:08:08] so church ages is the unfolding of the
[1:08:11] life
[1:08:13] but i'm an alpha and omega
[1:08:16] seed in the beginning
[1:08:17] seen in the ending
[1:08:19] and all in between is the life unfolding
[1:08:22] the life doesn't stop the life is
[1:08:24] gathered into the seed
[1:08:26] the shock only the the the life you know
[1:08:29] what the husker around the corn
[1:08:33] as i'm here sometimes they'll still
[1:08:34] re-heal brown here you know the corn
[1:08:36] still young i need to wait till it dry
[1:08:39] then you know the corn is about ready

[1:08:49] hundred fold
[1:08:50] you don't want the plant to seed and

[1:31:23] listen to this man
[1:31:25] what seemed
[1:31:26] to be the answer
[1:31:28] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[1:31:31] and manifest gifts of the spirit
[1:31:33] it was then believed
[1:31:35] that this was indeed the long awaited
[1:31:38] restoration
[1:31:40] it was not
[1:31:41] for the lattering
[1:31:43] can only come
[1:31:45] after the former rain which is the
[1:31:47] spring or teaching rain the latter and
[1:31:50] then is the harvest rain

[1:31:54] the teaching rain had not come and the
[1:31:57] prophet messenger who was sent to teach
[1:31:59] the people and turn the house of the
[1:32:01] children back to the pentecostal fathers

[1:41:24] because once it got once once one said
[1:41:27] commodity kind of glory the fresh the
[1:41:28] intellectual manner
[1:41:32] now the word
[1:41:33] now first justification the water that
[1:41:35] sanctified vessel
[1:41:37] into service
[1:41:38] now the holy spirit puts it in service
[1:41:41] to the holy ghost now to put him into
[1:41:43] service oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:41:46] oh my
[1:41:47] i was talking to someone the other day
[1:41:49] they were very careful even many of the
[1:41:51] holiness group not called the holy ghost
[1:41:53] holy ghost
[1:41:54] because they identify themselves with
[1:41:56] pentecostals so they don't want to say
[1:41:57] holy ghost
[1:41:58] when they do that they say holy spirit
[1:42:03] he says see
[1:42:04] keep them from saying holy ghost because
[1:42:06] the pentecostal people just call it what
[1:42:08] the bible says holy ghost which holy
[1:42:09] spirit holy ghost is the same thing
[1:42:11] but but terminology become an issue i
[1:42:14] don't want to use that term because i
[1:42:16] use that term it could look like i
[1:42:18] identify with them
[1:42:22] wow
[1:42:23] and they're very careful about it they
[1:42:25] don't want to identify with them tongue
[1:42:26] speaking people that's the holy spirit
[1:42:28] itself see what happened when the enemy
[1:42:30] that went on the signification was
[1:42:32] washed out returned back i found the
[1:42:34] house not filled with holy ghost now the
[1:42:35] status yet is joined but the league of
[1:42:36] teachers is worse and look at the loudly
[1:42:39] central church after they receive the
[1:42:40] holy ghost with the knowledge and the
[1:42:42] spirit of god within it then the works
[1:42:44] of god is denied by it and call it an
[1:42:46] evil work what about that there is where
[1:42:49] christ is put out of his own church
[1:42:51] never show them in the church until they
[1:42:53] come to laodicea when he cut law this
[1:42:55] year he had been put into it trying to
[1:42:56] get back in listen to the part i want to
[1:42:58] get to
[1:42:59] you see
[1:43:01] justification never put him in
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:05] signification just cleaned the place for
[1:43:07] him
[1:43:08] but when the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:11] come
[1:43:12] it put him
[1:43:13] in the people
[1:43:16] you can't break that
[1:43:18] you cannot break that
[1:43:20] the baptism the holy ghost put him
[1:43:29] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:43:35] my my mind
[1:43:37] glory
[1:43:39] hallelujah
[1:43:40] do you want him
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:46] like you have to seek him
[1:43:48] not seek blessing you're seeking him
[1:43:50] you want to know him
[1:43:52] you want to get in contact with him
[1:43:54] you want to get in contact with the
[1:43:55] power source
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:06] from see now there were the shock
[1:44:10] she gave birth what kind of boot not to
[1:44:13] the word
[1:44:14] this whole on his heart but to
[1:44:16] organizational bit
[1:44:17] there's methodists baptist pentecostals

[1:44:35] pentecostal they all took the habits of
[1:44:38] their mother

[1:44:43] first message come forth but when the
[1:44:44] truth was presented to luther's age he
[1:44:48] couldn't take it
[1:44:49] when the baptismal holy ghost was
[1:44:51] presented the methodists they couldn't
[1:44:53] take it

[1:44:57] one fresh this one fresh fresh
[1:44:59] this one fresh with chicken on it yeah
[1:45:02] that's good
[1:45:03] when the baptism of the holy ghost was
[1:45:05] permitted
[1:45:06] presented to the methodist they couldn't
[1:45:08] take it but now
[1:45:11] when the sea time
[1:45:13] has produced a pentecost
[1:45:16] she can't take it
[1:45:18] so but obama is prophesying
[1:45:21] that there's going to be a sea tank
[1:45:23] and that sea tank

[1:46:48] predestinated seed
[1:46:50] though's name that was put in labor life

[1:46:56] you can preach the sun it's like water
[1:46:58] on duck back
[1:47:00] it falls off

[1:47:04] watch what happens
[1:47:06] why it is predestinated seated
[1:47:10] coming forward
[1:47:11] it's got to come
[1:47:13] and when that light
[1:47:15] the gospel strikes it
[1:47:17] they get it
[1:47:18] the rest of them will walk away it's not
[1:47:20] for them the bible said they were
[1:47:22] forwarding for condemnation

[1:47:59] brother that them had their own stories

[1:50:05] they thought that but it wasn't that
[1:50:07] because they see they come yet that's my
[1:50:09] point water on the ground
[1:50:11] hallelujah there's no seed there he
[1:50:13] wasting time almost but that only
[1:50:15] prepared atmosphere for the prophet to
[1:50:17] come on the scene because he had the
[1:50:19] seed because his son is the saw
[1:50:22] solomon was veiled in him so he brought
[1:50:24] the seed
[1:50:25] we have the seed now

[1:51:14] and to identify where he's talking about
[1:51:16] he said out of the non-national churches
[1:51:20] so he is not talking about pentecostal
[1:51:22] baptism he's not talking about methodist
[1:51:24] or catholic charismatics he's not
[1:51:26] talking about that
[1:51:30] he is prophesying
[1:51:31] in this message
[1:51:34] it will be released
[1:51:38] must be released
[1:51:40] it shall be released
[1:51:42] it's being released

[1:53:00] to you
[1:53:02] you got to have it
[1:53:03] i will not let you go
[1:53:06] till you bless me

[1:53:15] hallelujah
[1:53:16] glory to god
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:35] tonight we're getting together there's
[1:53:37] racing up among the groups kind of
[1:53:38] comparison somebody tried to act like it
[1:53:40] live a different life and drink smoke
[1:53:42] and watch television things of the world
[1:53:44] and still call themselves pentecostals
[1:53:46] they're trying to imprison it a genuine
[1:53:48] it's never been revealed to them when
[1:53:51] it's revealed it is glorious
[1:53:53] something that takes that out of you
[1:53:56] when you walk in there
[1:53:58] moses veiled he was the living word to
[1:54:00] the people and the people that are
[1:54:02] veiled at the same thing their written
[1:54:04] epistles read of all men
[1:54:07] the word made manifest isn't that right
[1:54:10] your life shows what you are
[1:54:12] oh glory one time there was a boy he had
[1:54:14] gotten some trouble he was a good boy he
[1:54:16] went to court the judge said i find you
[1:54:18] guilty i must punish you to life in
[1:54:19] prison he said i want to try my own case
[1:54:22] i want to go upon my record he's just
[1:54:25] said you have no record
[1:54:27] your record is what condemned you
[1:54:29] and that's the way it is today the
[1:54:30] reason the church is not advanced like
[1:54:32] it should is the record
[1:54:34] it's the life we must become more
[1:54:36] dedicated
[1:54:38] we must believe every word of god we
[1:54:40] must seek watch we must seek until that
[1:54:44] word is made real to us
[1:54:46] so in other words the day for coming to
[1:54:48] church to to them
[1:54:50] make people feel they're not backstage
[1:54:52] that's finished
[1:54:53] you ain't coming to church because you
[1:54:54] know where to go this sunday morning
[1:54:56] stay home
[1:54:58] come to church because you understand
[1:54:59] your name is on the book
[1:55:01] and you're here to let the devil know
[1:55:02] whose side you're on
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:08] you're looking for your breakthrough
[1:55:10] you come here for your deliverance
[1:55:12] you're coming because you're not a piggy
[1:55:13] alarm you always want alarm
[1:55:15] just type in the mud they come in they
[1:55:17] get washed they come in they get clean
[1:55:18] they come and get liver they come in and
[1:55:20] get free
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:38] i want you to notice another
[1:55:39] characteristic of moses when he came out
[1:55:41] he being a prophet being a great man he
[1:55:43] was when he came up with the word the
[1:55:46] people saw that it was changed
[1:55:50] something had happened to him
[1:55:53] watch and when he come out
[1:55:56] with the vindicated word of that hour
[1:55:57] the commandments he was a changed person
[1:56:00] and so will you be
[1:56:02] when you come from behind that human
[1:56:04] veil
[1:56:05] that would laugh at a meeting like this
[1:56:07] that man who would stumble at the divine
[1:56:09] healing and say the miracle past you
[1:56:10] have dropped from behind that human veil
[1:56:13] the traditional real and everybody will
[1:56:15] know
[1:56:16] something happened to you
[1:56:18] your testimony wouldn't be i rent a
[1:56:21] church that's not a testimony
[1:56:24] i believe the prophet that's not a
[1:56:25] testimony
[1:56:27] that's a belief
[1:56:28] even here lucifer testimony did he never
[1:56:30] believe in chapter 2
[1:56:34] so if you're trembling
[1:56:36] the same part on pardon
[1:56:38] david tremble
[1:56:40] he believed and tremble
[1:56:41] you're not even trembling
[1:56:43] but you believe
[1:56:45] but believers are good enough
[1:56:47] because believers have come to our life
[1:56:49] you have to act upon what you believe
[1:56:51] to show your true truly belief
[1:56:54] when the doctors dismiss abraham because
[1:56:56] he doctor don't want to check him up no
[1:56:57] more
[1:56:58] abraham really believes he said doc i
[1:57:00] come for checkup he said what for
[1:57:02] checking last month to check it last
[1:57:04] year check your last 10 years like like
[1:57:05] 15 years
[1:57:06] is the same story
[1:57:09] no baby
[1:57:12] she's a chick sarah
[1:57:16] was sarah sarah even worse because god
[1:57:18] talked to she
[1:57:20] so she was just watching the doctor and
[1:57:21] she she cared
[1:57:23] she has no reference
[1:57:25] god talk to abraham put abraham get the
[1:57:27] hole up for sarah too

[1:57:37] this 25 years thing give god a greater
[1:57:39] testimony

[1:57:47] going to pack up shop and rock in a
[1:57:48] rocking chair and say oh god
[1:57:50] you forget me abraham staggered that at
[1:57:53] the promise of god through unbelief but
[1:57:56] was strong in faith
[1:57:58] given glory to god because he was fully
[1:58:00] persuaded that what he promised
[1:58:03] he was able to perform
[1:58:05] abraham had one message
[1:58:07] isaac coming
[1:58:09] hallelujah he put it on a card he put it

[2:11:20] another water
[2:11:22] but god give the increase
[2:11:25] the sword

[2:11:41] hallelujah
[2:11:43] so don't think for one moment they could
[2:11:45] shelve the preachers
[2:11:47] the preachers are attained to water the
[2:11:50] word
[2:11:51] another quote for that you may be seated
[2:11:54] hallelujah
[2:11:55] when a church
[2:11:56] is grown in
[2:11:58] under the persecution of the outside
[2:12:00] world
[2:12:00] message world
[2:12:02] believing in the lord jesus
[2:12:04] that the promise of the holy ghost
[2:12:07] is just as real to us
[2:12:09] as it was the pentecost
[2:12:11] how they groan
[2:12:13] and cry
[2:12:14] let the entire message world laugh
[2:12:18] let them laugh
[2:12:19] we're gonna grow
[2:12:21] we're gonna try
[2:12:22] we're gonna call
[2:12:24] we've got the holy ghost
[2:12:25] just that's real
[2:12:27] what they had about there
[2:12:29] picking another day
[2:12:30] i found out i'm also
[2:12:33] i'm omega
[2:12:34] oh glory to god
[2:12:37] but the branham said
[2:12:39] when the revival strikes
[2:12:41] the sisters down wash the dishes
[2:12:43] is more than singing message songs it's
[2:12:45] more than having no more songs the
[2:12:48] sisters can't watch traditions
[2:12:50] why because holy ghost
[2:12:53] holy ghost
[2:12:54] holy ghost
[2:12:55] holy ghost
[2:12:57] poor legal
[2:12:58] this message needs it
[2:13:00] this message needs it
[2:13:02] yeah we need it
[2:13:04] oh get the lord that shock
[2:13:07] transform your life
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:10] how they groan
[2:13:12] and cry in their liver pain
[2:13:14] but when they are born and positionally
[2:13:16] born into the kingdom of god
[2:13:18] then the holy ghost are set in the
[2:13:19] church some apostles
[2:13:21] some prophets some teachers some pastors
[2:13:24] some evangelists ministers that they
[2:13:26] don't even know this quote
[2:13:27] they don't even know that the holy ghost
[2:13:29] after position replaced them
[2:13:31] positionally placed because we
[2:13:33] identified with the message but the
[2:13:35] message of identifying you except with
[2:13:37] us
[2:13:38] god have to say this is my son
[2:13:40] we can claim whatever you want to claim
[2:13:41] say whatever you want to say brother
[2:13:44] branham was called to do the work of an
[2:13:46] evangelist until he was placed
[2:13:48] positionally to be that elijah
[2:13:50] when he opened sex heals oh give the
[2:13:53] lord a shout
[2:13:54] when he opened six seals god vindicates
[2:13:57] his ministry as that elijah because
[2:13:59] christ is a seventh seal
[2:14:01] oh
[2:14:02] are you ready
[2:14:04] are you ready for some more
[2:14:06] do you want to put layer on top a layer
[2:14:08] that the devil have no room to move
[2:14:14] let's nail this down
[2:14:16] what the end time message
[2:14:19] is to get a bride ready and prepare for
[2:14:21] the rapture
[2:14:22] according to malachi 4
[2:14:24] is to bring back the fate
[2:14:26] that was once delivered to the saints
[2:14:29] bring them back to the faith of the
[2:14:30] fathers
[2:14:31] the pentecostal part
[2:14:33] in the restoration time
[2:14:36] so he is prophesying that there's gonna
[2:14:38] be a pentecostal part
[2:14:40] in the time of restoration
[2:14:43] we are in that park now
[2:14:45] we are in that slot right now
[2:14:47] oh glory to god what part
[2:14:49] the pentecostal part
[2:14:51] where we sign where are we crying where
[2:14:55] are we groaning where are we moaning
[2:14:58] oh glory to god
[2:15:00] hallelujah
[2:15:02] hallelujah
[2:15:04] this messenger of malachi 4
[2:15:06] and revelation 10 7
[2:15:08] is going to do two things
[2:15:10] according to malachi 4
[2:15:12] he will turn hearts of the children to
[2:15:13] the fathers two
[2:15:15] he revealed the mysteries of the seven
[2:15:17] thunders
[2:15:18] in revelation 10
[2:15:20] which are
[2:15:21] the revelations contained in the seven
[2:15:23] seals it will be these
[2:15:26] divinely revealed on the line e90
[2:15:29] mystery truths
[2:15:30] is what would literally
[2:15:32] turn the hearts of the children
[2:15:34] back to the pentecostal fathers that's
[2:15:37] what the prophet said
[2:15:38] that's the word we say amen that
[2:15:41] amen to that
[2:15:42] they finally reveal mystery truths
[2:15:45] supreme supposed to produce the fate
[2:15:48] to bring down the power faith is not to
[2:15:50] say i have faith faith have a production
[2:15:53] with it he said works
[2:15:55] is faith
[2:15:56] express
[2:15:57] you can't profit you have to produce
[2:16:00] faith
[2:16:00] [Applause]
[2:16:03] give the lord a shout
[2:16:05] give the lord a shout
[2:16:07] show me your faith
[2:16:09] without words
[2:16:10] i will show you my faith by my works
[2:16:13] that's what james said that was the
[2:16:14] bible said right
[2:16:19] now watch
[2:16:20] to qualify this statement
[2:16:23] that we just read
[2:16:25] literally
[2:16:26] turn the hearts of the children to the
[2:16:28] princes of fathers so from this quote
[2:16:31] here it looked like the more talk we
[2:16:33] have
[2:16:34] the more revelations we preach the more
[2:16:36] mystery please is the more faith in the
[2:16:38] people
[2:16:39] see it looks like that that's how it
[2:16:41] looks but that's not what he's saying
[2:16:43] here
[2:16:44] to say to take this here you have to
[2:16:46] take what else he said
[2:16:48] and this is what he said here we know
[2:16:50] the scriptures say that jesus is the
[2:16:51] chief on the stone
[2:16:52] he also is a headstone
[2:16:54] now watch in a few minutes the seven
[2:16:57] church messenger was to restore
[2:17:00] the faith of the children
[2:17:02] back to the fathers in other words
[2:17:05] rebuild the church again
[2:17:08] under the power of the spirit
[2:17:10] not by mind not by power but by my
[2:17:14] spirit said the lord not my organization
[2:17:17] not my denomination but by the holy
[2:17:18] spirit god will bring forth the church
[2:17:21] in the last days
[2:17:22] so this mystery truth is supposed to
[2:17:25] bring us
[2:17:26] back to rebuild the church
[2:17:28] in the power of the spirit
[2:17:30] do you believe that
[2:17:32] oh glory to god he said i'll restore it
[2:17:35] again in the last days it will be
[2:17:37] restored god shall send the holy ghost
[2:17:40] in such a way upon planted wood that it
[2:17:44] will restore
[2:17:46] so this restoration is not no
[2:17:48] intellectual taking notes thing or give
[2:17:51] the lord a shout
[2:17:53] it's the holy ghost to come upon what
[2:17:55] word in you
[2:18:02] listen church
[2:18:04] if you don't have the word in you
[2:18:06] and the firefall you are back in 1906
[2:18:08] pentecost
[2:18:12] because god was anointed men and doing
[2:18:13] men men was drinking and smoking or
[2:18:15] cutting and selling the power of god
[2:18:16] upon them
[2:18:17] because it was upon them there was no
[2:18:20] conduit for god to really use
[2:18:22] within them so god say you know what i
[2:18:25] will bring my word now
[2:18:26] i'm going to put my word in people
[2:18:28] and my word will be the conduct of the
[2:18:30] spirit
[2:18:31] because with that word i'll give the
[2:18:33] proving grounds of character
[2:18:38] with that word i'll bring tests
[2:18:41] to see the metal in the men
[2:18:45] listen
[2:18:46] it is supremely scary to applaud the
[2:18:48] character you know
[2:18:49] let's not talk about what he say talking
[2:18:51] about party
[2:18:53] just talk about the power without
[2:18:54] character
[2:18:56] we seasoned governments
[2:18:57] receipts and prime ministers and
[2:18:59] presidents and people with
[2:19:01] these normal men you know adulterers
[2:19:03] fornicating lion men but don't talk
[2:19:06] online
[2:19:07] the next thing by itself
[2:19:09] and they in charge of people and
[2:19:10] people's lives
[2:19:12] men without heart without compassion
[2:19:15] and they're in power
[2:19:16] same thing in churches too
[2:19:20] but god wants our wit
[2:19:24] [Applause]
[2:19:26] and every test is customized
[2:19:29] your tests have your name on it
[2:19:31] you can pick somebody's paper and do the
[2:19:33] exam
[2:19:34] when god say put your name god put your
[2:19:36] name he put every test
[2:19:38] every child he know what you could go
[2:19:40] through
[2:19:42] when god put you in the capsule of his
[2:19:44] pressure he know you want to be
[2:19:45] pressurized because you are more things
[2:19:48] coming
[2:19:50] so when god dropped the lion and david
[2:19:53] god no lad it's not he's not the lion is
[2:19:55] he testing him
[2:19:56] that's just an introduction
[2:19:58] god say hold up
[2:20:02] lion and beer
[2:20:04] david had a private experience
[2:20:07] that qualified for public exposure
[2:20:14] did you get that
[2:20:15] did you get that
[2:20:17] he had his private overcoming
[2:20:19] nobody was there
[2:20:21] his brothers was terrorizing him wasn't
[2:20:23] there
[2:20:24] as far as he concerned his sheep he came
[2:20:25] out it wasn't fair for the lionel his
[2:20:27] love for the sheep
[2:20:31] tell the lord i shall
[2:20:33] give the lord our show
[2:20:34] [Applause]
[2:20:38] stop looking at you
[2:20:40] love god
[2:20:42] put all your heart
[2:20:43] with all your mind
[2:20:45] with all your soul
[2:20:46] with all your strength
[2:20:48] when you look at you you will give up
[2:20:50] when you look at you you will mess up

[2:30:28] if the church only consists
[2:30:31] if the body of christ is only controlled
[2:30:33] by intellectuals theology mental
[2:30:36] conception then we are wholly dependent

[2:30:42] if i make that clear
[2:30:44] if the church only rests upon the
[2:30:46] intellectual how that man could set the

[2:30:56] we only need the intellectual conception
[2:30:59] of man we don't need the holy spirit

[2:46:49] because you know what
[2:46:51] when you're waiting
[2:46:55] you're going south and i don't see you
[2:46:56] going soon
[2:46:58] you head you get episode
[2:47:02] you ain't know where you're going you
[2:47:03] just get sick
[2:47:05] they say i go and show you a second also
[2:47:09] you don't know what salt is
[2:47:11] you have to get a map
[2:47:13] a watch
[2:47:15] if i don't i get in trouble
[2:47:17] and here we go
[2:47:19] there is no shortcuts in the kingdom of
[2:47:21] god
[2:47:25] you know we try to make shortcut we go
[2:47:27] to the end upon somewhere admired that's
[2:47:29] what we do and then we get off the old
[2:47:32] highway of god
[2:47:33] god
[2:47:34] made a part
[2:47:36] and a way
[2:47:38] when the children of israel come out of
[2:47:39] egypt they followed god's path
[2:47:42] it led them to the red sea
[2:47:45] it is strange that god would lead his
[2:47:47] part that way
[2:47:49] but his path went right through the sea
[2:47:52] and when it come time for the shooting
[2:47:53] and israel stood before the sea god part
[2:47:56] led across the sea so god looked down to
[2:47:58] the pillar of fire
[2:47:59] the sea got scared
[2:48:01] and moved back
[2:48:02] because when george john is drawing to
[2:48:05] bring them to the promised land it draws
[2:48:06] straight to the red sea
[2:48:08] they may see oh god plant this route but
[2:48:10] god planted straight to the red sea so
[2:48:13] when moses confronted the red sea the
[2:48:15] rest you have to open up because god
[2:48:16] already drew a line
[2:48:18] god draw that line already
[2:48:19] go there go into a room the red sea we
[2:48:22] going through the red sea
[2:48:23] i tell you the line to this holy ghost
[2:48:25] already drawn
[2:48:27] where are we going dead we go into it we
[2:48:29] go into it
[2:48:30] [Applause]
[2:48:36] he went right up to the wilderness into
[2:48:38] the spring of mara bitter water isn't it
[2:48:41] strange that god would lead his turn to
[2:48:42] beat the waters
[2:48:43] and them all along the road and when he
[2:48:45] was there remedy for the bitter waters
[2:48:47] moses cut down a tree and throw this in
[2:48:49] the water
[2:48:50] and the water did sweet again
[2:48:52] some through the waters
[2:48:53] some through the flood
[2:48:55] some to deep trials but all through the
[2:48:57] blood that's the way god leads his
[2:48:59] children
[2:49:01] that's god's provided way
[2:49:03] and if the children israel would have
[2:49:04] tried to bypass and go around they would
[2:49:07] got in trouble they had to follow the
[2:49:09] code of fire they had to follow the
[2:49:11] cloud and the church tonight if the
[2:49:14] church tonight will only follow the
[2:49:15] pillar of fire the holy spirit you will
[2:49:18] make canaan as sure as anything
[2:49:22] there are two ways a man can go his way
[2:49:25] or god's way and that's the right way or
[2:49:28] the wrong way and your way
[2:49:30] is always wrong
[2:49:32] god's way is always right
[2:49:34] you can't be in your way and in god's
[2:49:36] way at the same time so you got to get
[2:49:38] out of your own way so god can make
[2:49:40] history in you
[2:49:41] god makes a provided way
[2:49:44] oh glory to god
[2:49:46] hallelujah
[2:49:47] hallelujah let's separate the born of
[2:49:50] the water
[2:49:51] and of the spirit he will no wise enter
[2:49:53] his kingdom
[2:49:55] no wise
[2:49:56] no matter who's methodist baptist
[2:49:58] whatever he is he will not enter until
[2:50:01] he's born of water and spirit
[2:50:03] born means to be changed he has to die
[2:50:06] before he can be born and you've got to
[2:50:08] die to yourself
[2:50:09] to be reborn
[2:50:11] in christ jesus
[2:50:12] oh glory to god
[2:50:14] hallelujah

[2:50:18] but the one that does the will of the
[2:50:20] father

[2:50:28] race there is no shortcuts you must come

[2:51:37] jacob
[2:51:40] he got a birthright
[2:51:42] he's feeling good now
[2:51:44] he's still tricking people yeah the bird
[2:51:46] right
[2:51:47] listen to the prophet i forgot it
[2:51:49] he thought everything was all right
[2:51:52] because he had a right
[2:51:53] he talked the thing was subtle he
[2:51:55] counted his brother when he was hungry
[2:51:57] coming from the field
[2:51:59] he swear he got the bit right he said
[2:52:01] pentecost here is where you feel
[2:52:04] you thought
[2:52:06] because you were born of the spirit
[2:52:08] the birthright that settled it but that
[2:52:10] only starts it
[2:52:14] do you remember the message him how that
[2:52:17] child after he was born in the family
[2:52:18] become a son it had rights to the
[2:52:21] birthright but it had to be proven
[2:52:24] child trained
[2:52:26] then if it did not prove out to be an
[2:52:27] obedient child to the father's will
[2:52:29] it did not get become ear
[2:52:32] it had nothing
[2:52:34] yet it was a son
[2:52:35] he had nothing if he wasn't interested
[2:52:37] in the father's work
[2:52:38] so when the holy ghost fell upon the
[2:52:40] pentecostal people and they began to
[2:52:42] restore back the gifts that was in the
[2:52:43] church they thought
[2:52:45] because they were born of the spirit
[2:52:46] that settled it but you see there's a
[2:52:48] placing of a son
[2:52:49] and after the son has proven to be a
[2:52:51] real son then he's taken to a public
[2:52:54] place
[2:52:55] jacob thought
[2:52:56] because he had the birthright everything
[2:52:58] was made
[2:53:00] hallelujah
[2:53:01] so did the pentecostal people but the
[2:53:04] fussing and pulling one another proved
[2:53:06] that the token wasn't showing
[2:53:08] malice envy strife that's where it got
[2:53:11] to
[2:53:12] chica by the same thing
[2:53:13] but in fear one night
[2:53:16] of his own life
[2:53:18] desperation
[2:53:19] took a hold of him
[2:53:21] just across that river yonder my brother
[2:53:24] is waiting to kill me
[2:53:28] not have a hot dog waiting for me
[2:53:33] he said my brother waiting to kill me
[2:53:38] birthright he had gotten
[2:53:39] was the thing that was going to cause
[2:53:41] his death
[2:53:43] and sometimes
[2:53:44] the very thing you receive
[2:53:46] as the holy spirit
[2:53:48] is it is a born-again respiratory if you
[2:53:51] don't watch that same thing will condemn
[2:53:53] you
[2:53:54] at the end
[2:53:56] very same waters that save noah
[2:53:57] condemned the world
[2:53:59] jacob knew his life was closed at the
[2:54:00] end he had a messenger come and told him
[2:54:03] his brother and 400 armed men was coming
[2:54:05] to meet him
[2:54:06] he was on his road
[2:54:08] fear take a hold of him
[2:54:10] he sent a man head with ox
[2:54:12] with cattle
[2:54:13] sheep
[2:54:14] to make peace offering with esau
[2:54:16] after that he started another group with
[2:54:17] another stuff
[2:54:19] he started another group with another
[2:54:20] stuff trying to meet the first
[2:54:22] chinese tune his rat then he got to
[2:54:24] thinking that won't stop him
[2:54:26] because he's probably richer than i am
[2:54:28] he doesn't need it
[2:54:30] then he took his wives little children
[2:54:32] send them a cross that esau will see the
[2:54:35] little children in his wife
[2:54:37] surely
[2:54:38] on his own little niece and nephew
[2:54:41] he will not slay them
[2:54:42] then he still he couldn't do it
[2:54:44] god know how to get a man
[2:54:46] jacob crossed the brook
[2:54:49] goddard on his knees
[2:54:51] jacob mean a deceiver
[2:54:53] but there was something had to happen to
[2:54:54] him
[2:54:56] in desperation
[2:54:57] when death laid before him
[2:55:00] and there may be men and women here
[2:55:01] tonight death lays right before you
[2:55:04] and the only way you will ever be able
[2:55:06] to achieve the thing you're wanting

[2:58:35] jacob stayed there
[2:58:36] until something happened
[2:58:38] that make him walk different
[2:58:40] made him a different person because he
[2:58:42] stayed there
[2:58:43] until something happened
[2:58:45] he held on
[2:58:47] until he was changed
[2:58:48] jacob stayed there until the blessing
[2:58:51] came
[2:58:52] and changed his name
[2:58:54] from a deceiver
[2:58:55] to a prince with god
[2:58:57] all glory to god the results was
[2:59:01] because he got desperate
[2:59:04] about this thing
[2:59:05] and the next day
[2:59:07] when he met esho he didn't need any
[2:59:10] guards he walked right out and met him
[2:59:13] he had got desperation
[2:59:15] till he got the assurance
[2:59:17] if a duck
[2:59:19] had the instinct
[2:59:21] to lead the ducks
[2:59:23] out of coldness
[2:59:24] he said what about the holy ghost in the
[2:59:26] church
[2:59:27] it ought to lead us
[2:59:29] from all formalities and creeds and
[2:59:31] things
[2:59:32] into a glorious
[2:59:33] wonderful
[2:59:34] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:59:36] it brings virtue
[2:59:38] knowledge
[2:59:39] patience godliness and the holy spirit
[2:59:42] that is what the real guy
[2:59:45] would lead
[2:59:46] because you're going to breed nothing
[2:59:47] else
[2:59:48] but the gospel
[2:59:50] oh glory to god
[2:59:52] hallelujah
[2:59:54] and the way god is expecting us
[2:59:56] as individuals to grow
[2:59:58] is the way he brought the church to grow
[3:00:00] oh glory to god
[3:00:02] he brought his church up the same way he
[3:00:04] brought the church up the same way he is
[3:00:06] bringing people up peter said seven
[3:00:08] things faith virtue knowledge temperance
[3:00:10] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[3:00:13] then the love of god
[3:00:14] the holy ghost here we go christ
[3:00:17] in the person of the holy ghost
[3:00:19] comes upon you
[3:00:21] in the true
[3:00:22] baptism of the holy ghost and you got
[3:00:24] all these virtues sealed into you
[3:00:29] then
[3:00:31] god lives in that tabernacle
[3:00:34] called the building
[3:00:36] the living tabernacle of the living
[3:00:38] god's dwelling place
[3:00:40] and when a man possesses
[3:00:42] these kinds of things
[3:00:44] then the holy ghost
[3:00:46] comes upon him
[3:00:48] oh glory to god
[3:00:50] so now it don't belong to no
[3:00:53] denominational spree
[3:00:54] because it's time for the uniting of men
[3:00:57] and women of every race every color
[3:01:00] every creed everything under christ by
[3:01:03] the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:01:04] and back to the word
