[24:10] approach it in Jesus name we ask it amen
[24:13] and amen God bless you thanks for coming
[24:16] welcome uh will like turn our Bibles to
[24:18] Matthew chapter 16 we want to read verse
[24:21] 13 to 18 and we want to read Acts 2 1-4
[24:25] and 12-8 for scripture reading this
[24:30] tonight so reading uh Matthew 16 reading
[24:35] verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast
[24:38] of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[24:40] disciples saying whom do men say I the
[24:43] son of man am and they said some say
[24:46] thou John the Baptist some Elias others
[24:48] jeremias one of the prophets he said
[24:50] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[24:53] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[24:55] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[24:58] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[25:01] art thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and
[25:04] Blood had not revealed it unto thee but
[25:07] my Father which is in heaven and I say
[25:09] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[25:12] This Rock I will build my church and the
[25:15] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[25:19] it acts chapter 2 one I read 1 to 4 and
[25:23] then we go to 12 and when the day of
[25:25] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[25:27] with one Accord in one one place and
[25:29] suddenly there came a song from Heaven
[25:31] as of A rushan Mighty Wind it filled all
[25:34] the house where they was sitting and
[25:36] they appeared unto them clothing Tong
[25:38] note a song they could hear it note that
[25:43] there was a wind they could feel it note
[25:47] that there were clothing tongues like
[25:49] fire they could see it and they appeared
[25:51] unto them clothing tongues like as a
[25:53] fire and it sat upon each of them and
[25:56] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[25:59] and begin to speak with other tongues as
[26:01] the spirit give them utterance verse 12
[26:05] and after the people started respond and
[26:07] Peter said and they were all amazed and
[26:09] were in doubt saying one to another what
[26:11] mean it this go is something new others
[26:14] mocking said these men are full of new
[26:16] wine but Peter standing up at the 11
[26:20] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[26:22] ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in
[26:25] Jerusalem be known unto you and hearken
[26:27] to my word
[26:28] for these are not drunk as he supposed
[26:31] seen is about the third hour of the day
[26:33] people don't drink around that hour but
[26:35] this is that which was spoken by the
[26:38] prophet Joel that it shall come to pass
[26:40] after in the last days said God I will
[26:43] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[26:46] your sons and your daughters shall
[26:48] prophesy your young men shall see
[26:50] visions and your old men shall dream
[26:52] dreams and on my servants and on my
[26:54] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[26:57] of my spirit and they shall prophesy may
[27:00] God bless his word you may have your
[27:03] seats praise God thank you Lord Jesus
[27:06] it's good to be here tonight I feel the
[27:09] anointing right off the scriptures right
[27:10] off the word and it's a good thing to
[27:12] feel that kind of a way praise God so
[27:15] this message is not disconnected from
[27:16] feelings and from the wind and from the
[27:19] seeing the the fire and everything else
[27:22] no it's it's right there in the word
[27:24] okay so I have a title the spirit is
[27:26] here to turn Revelation into
[27:30] experience that's the title the spirit
[27:32] is here to turn Revelation into
[27:36] experience all right let's go brother BR
[27:40] God did not intend for the church to be
[27:42] governed by
[27:43] intellectual or by any Theology of man
[27:47] but the Holy Spirit was given to the
[27:50] church to govern and control the body of
[27:54] Christ so he said no matter
[27:58] in doing that with that in mind in God's
[28:01] program we will never be successful no
[28:04] matter how good our intentions are until
[28:07] we get back into the center of God's
[28:11] program where the holy spirit so the
[28:13] holy spirit is the center of God's
[28:15] program it's not man now man could speak
[28:18] and it don't have to be the Holy Spirit
[28:20] but what you want to see is the holy
[28:21] spirit in operation right realizing this
[28:24] is no new thing to preach on it is
[28:25] something that's been preached on many
[28:27] times but but the way we approach it and
[28:29] the way we take it we take it still
[28:31] thinking that it's a holy spirit control
[28:35] and yet we put our intellectuals mixed
[28:38] with it and then we get a conglomeration
[28:42] of both Holy Spirit and intellectuals
[28:44] and when the Holy Spirit desires to do a
[28:46] thing and degrade something or lift
[28:49] something up it causes petty jealousy
[28:51] among the people which proves that they
[28:54] haven't got the holy spirit so petty
[28:56] jealousy evidence absence of Holy Spirit
[29:01] every man would want to be in his place
[29:03] and in this the people has a reason
[29:05] because they see so much denominational
[29:08] so many different dictators so when I
[29:10] talk about dictators is here you know he
[29:13] said the spiritual dictators in the
[29:15] church to say thus and thus and I call
[29:17] it message popes but the Holy Spirit has
[29:19] placed each one into the body of Christ
[29:22] and we are helpless to maneuver without
[29:26] every member of our body
[29:29] so the nose can't feel led to go off
[29:31] because he feel to smell something
[29:32] different and the eye doing this and the
[29:35] Hand doing this is a body and you want
[29:37] every part of that body isn't that right
[29:39] we have so much what we have to have my
[29:43] hands my arms my mouth my eyes
[29:46] everything that me now when you begin to
[29:48] see this the way God see it you
[29:50] recognize men acting stupid and foolish
[29:53] to try to break up the church and try to
[29:55] say I have it you don't have it and read
[29:56] better more revelation and God With Us
[29:59] and all kind of foolishness you
[30:01] recognize how Petty it is because it's a
[30:03] body of Christ it's an international
[30:06] body and by one Spirit no man can put
[30:08] you in by one Spirit you are baptized
[30:10] into that body no church could put you
[30:12] in no man could put you in the kingdom
[30:15] is preached and Every Man Press their
[30:17] way into it oh give the Lord some
[30:18] Praises that's how God set it up he set
[30:21] it up that we press our way into it okay
[30:24] let's go watch everything that's in me
[30:27] are in me has to operate to make my body
[30:29] function properly then if God wanted his
[30:33] body the church to be governed by his
[30:35] Spirit there's got to be some way or
[30:38] some program that we have got to enter
[30:40] into that but that we ever had that we
[30:43] already had he said now Ezekiel says God
[30:46] speaking he said now watch um he said a
[30:49] new heart I'll give you I'll take away
[30:51] your Stony heart a new spirit I'll give
[30:53] you he never said he have a facelift to
[30:55] the old church he would have a new thing
[30:57] br you and in doing this yeah here we go
[31:00] in doing this you can't mix an old
[31:02] intellectual church with a new
[31:04] Pentecostal experience Church there two
[31:06] kind of churches there we not talking
[31:08] about Pentecostal denomination because
[31:10] true Pentecostal is an experience so the
[31:12] Pentecostal experience you can't mix it
[31:13] with intellectual it's two different
[31:15] things Al together oh glory to God are
[31:17] you with me so Jesus Tau the same thing
[31:20] he said you cannot put new wine in Old
[31:22] bottles Oh Glory to God and the bottle

[31:27] sewed up and and so on and the new wine
[31:29] when you put in it it when the skin get
[31:31] old and dry lacking oil it will burst

[37:28] this message could never go still you
[37:31] may be seated this message could never
[37:34] go old because the Bible could never go
[37:36] stale and the Bible could never go old

[38:43] tonight oh give the Lord a hallelujah
[38:46] praise God drunk with new wine the wine
[38:49] of Revelation the wine of God oh it's a
[38:52] joy to connect with this wine but
[38:55] brandom say this here now remind me may
[38:57] have a vision I seen before I ever met
[38:59] the Pentecostal people of a man going
[39:01] around the world in white you heard me
[39:04] tell it many times and one come behind
[39:07] him sowing seeds of Discord and we see
[39:10] that evident in this
[39:12] message and what in the Garden of Eden
[39:15] by lust of Eve for sin the lust of Eve
[39:20] of sin then if Eve losted for knowledge
[39:25] it was sin what did the devil tell Eve
[39:28] God know that if you eat of this tree
[39:31] you shall know and you shall be like of
[39:34] God now all EV had to do was to confess
[39:37] the word eat every tree but that tree we
[39:40] not to touch that because God said so
[39:42] that's is all that's all explanation but
[39:44] the devil brought a revelation what the
[39:47] reason why he said don't touch that
[39:49] because you have more information behind
[39:52] that that God doesn't want you to know
[39:54] God don't want you have the knowledge of
[39:56] that and I am here to tell you put your
[39:58] hand touch it eat
[40:03] it so the lust that Eve end up having
[40:06] was for
[40:07] knowledge that's a big
[40:10] one that what about silly
[40:13] woman Laden with what divers lust ever
[40:18] learning and ever coming to the that
[40:21] coming in N of the truth yeah silly
[40:26] woman those those hands clocking around
[40:28] the new peacock the
[40:31] new new peacock in tongue all right so
[40:35] watch brother
[40:37] BR when we lust for knowledge it's a sin
[40:41] to do so that's a strong statement but
[40:45] that's the truth no matter how strong it
[40:48] is still the truth to lust for knowledge
[40:50] and understanding so what you're
[40:52] supposed to desire is
[40:54] revelation and Revelation is the spirit
[40:56] revealing to you
[40:58] therefore you have to get in the spirit
[41:00] you can't sit down there in your flesh
[41:01] your caral mind hoping for Revelation
[41:03] and you're not getting in the spirit
[41:05] that is why the devil fought worship
[41:07] fought the atmosphere fought the spirit
[41:10] and the more intellectual and dead and
[41:12] dry the people is in this message the
[41:13] less Revelation they have so we know
[41:15] that set of dead hens eggs ring in
[41:18] church because there is no life there
[41:21] for the spirit to reveal because for you
[41:23] to get prevailing power because that's
[41:25] what Revelation is revelation prevailing
[41:27] power shout prevailing power prev that's
[41:30] what Revelation is revelation is
[41:31] prevailing power so without Revelation
[41:33] in the church there is like a prevailing
[41:35] power the people know God s a prophet
[41:37] they know the message is right but there
[41:39] is no prevailing power Oh Glory to God
[41:41] we're going to press on we're going to
[41:42] press on because when the test come to
[41:45] God will test you to see if you will
[41:46] stagger or
[41:47] not Oh Glory to God that's what the test
[41:50] is about you know to see how much you
[41:52] going to stagger because all G is the
[41:54] handle the word you have a son Abraham
[41:57] you have no evidence he have a
[41:58] revelation he don't have an experience
[42:01] he never had a child he have he all has
[42:03] a revelation but God had to bring him
[42:06] from Revelation to experience and he had
[42:08] to Journey from one state to the next
[42:11] state he had to Journey for 25 years
[42:13] brother George with Revelation Oh Glory
[42:16] to God no experience of Isaac Revelation
[42:19] is what make him build the the the the
[42:21] the crib Revelation make him bring all
[42:23] the boot all the booties and everything
[42:25] else Revelation make him say I'm I'm I'm
[42:27] God is more than
[42:31] able without a revelation he sit down
[42:33] and said but this this make sense to
[42:35] know because I will be almost half dead
[42:37] already there just forget this thing God
[42:40] must have make a mistake or something
[42:41] like that no that's intellect that the
[42:43] right but he didn't have that he's tager
[42:45] not Oh Glory to God his face his faith
[42:48] was tested for 25 years oh let's put it
[42:51] this way his Revelation or the wine he
[42:54] had this new wine he had Sarah didn't
[42:56] have that why that why she was laughing
[42:58] but Abraham wasn't laughing because he
[43:00] heard from Heaven woo glory to God he
[43:03] had a different kind of laugh if Abram
[43:05] was laughing he laughing different
[43:07] because he heard from God God told him
[43:09] count the number of stars so shall thy
[43:11] seed be oh God change his name to give
[43:14] him a a covering of expectation that he
[43:17] will be the father of Nations oh give
[43:19] the Lord a shout without no children God
[43:22] say hold that hold Revelation until you
[43:26] come into the EXP experience oh give the
[43:28] Lord a shout hallelujah do you
[43:32] understand that tonight do you
[43:34] understand when God or asked him to
[43:35] offer up Isaac it wasn't a hard thing
[43:37] for him because you know where Isaac
[43:39] come from that was a miracle that was a
[43:42] product of his faith and you know God
[43:44] able to bring him back so when he was
[43:46] with the man he said I and the lad we
[43:47] going up and we coming back down and he
[43:50] knew he was going to offer up Isaac
[43:51] because he knew the God that he serve is
[43:53] more than able to bring back and if God
[43:56] could bring back Oh Glory to God we got
[43:59] to trust God more we got to show God we
[44:01] trust
[44:02] [Applause]
[44:04] him when Abraham off up Isaac on the
[44:06] altar the L foolish said Daddy seen the
[44:09] wood the fire but where is the where is
[44:12] the
[44:13] sacrifice are you tying him down and
[44:16] Abraham saying God will will will
[44:19] provide for himself that's
[44:22] sacrifice that the faith there you know
[44:25] Hallelujah God will Pro fight for
[44:27] himself and when he coming down I say
[44:29] hold your hand I know you playing Bluff
[44:31] you know people Bluff oh you really want
[44:33] me

[44:53] trapped he had to get no lasto and run

[45:35] in people's hearts hear this brother
[45:38] clar we are trying to establish
[45:42] ourselves this isn't the message now by
[45:45] some many people they know the minister
[45:47] off they C leave because the minister in
[45:50] the
[45:51] heart not Jesus they will kill for that
[45:55] man they will die for that man the man
[45:58] off the beaten part Hallelujah churches

[46:04] doctrine of the church Hallelujah in a
[46:07] person's heart we see it so that do with
[46:11] what God saying I know we say it so what
[46:14] did God
[46:17] say we are commanded to establish the
[46:21] word of
[46:25] God at what reading again right we are
[46:29] commanded to establish the word of God
[46:32] Paul said see he have a backing backing
[46:36] I didn't come to you with enticing words
[46:39] of man that your faith might rest on the
[46:41] knowledge of man but I come to you in
[46:44] power in the manifestation of the Holy
[46:46] Ghost that your faith might rest in
[46:52] God see if I come and tell you last
[46:54] night I meet an angel
[46:57] he was 6'2 and he hear was thing and
[46:59] thing and thing and thing and he tell me
[47:01] so and so and so then your faith resting
[47:04] on my testimony you didn't you see
[47:09] him suppose I
[47:14] misread supp my eye was seeing like at
[47:17] that time somebody seeing light upstair
[47:19] and light and light moving and light and
[47:21] light the man had a torch light light up
[47:22] ins inside his back pocket you and he
[47:24] was moving around so he Wonder know what
[47:25] that light is what that light is
[47:27] light trigger on in man back pocket roof
[47:31] up somebody saying P fire
[47:35] fire torch
[47:39] lightall not everything your eyes see
[47:42] register as the
[47:44] God angel Satan comes as a angel of
[47:50] Light one time one of them come with a
[47:52] robe a brother come say he's got a robe
[47:53] he's a special man what they say they
[47:55] see you have a robe
[47:57] and somebody see the r they said bring
[47:58] him to Martin
[48:00] Martin he want to
[48:02] go because Martin was the messing bring
[48:05] him to Martin you know when he come to
[48:07] Martin the
[48:09] disappear don't explain to me how he had
[48:11] the r don't explain I can't explain that
[48:13] like a brother come and show me a
[48:14] pyramid like sideways horizontal pyramid
[48:17] a light inside his house and I watch it
[48:19] so I can explain that what you supposed
[48:22] to do with that
[48:24] follow these things you can't explain I
[48:26] don't know who behind that all I know
[48:29] that is not what I I'm on I I have no
[48:31] authority to follow whether the pyr
[48:33] curves so light so it he s so he hide so
[48:36] what what I supposed to mean that mean
[48:40] nothing test the spirit how by the word
[48:45] they have to see what what what the
[48:47] angel tell
[48:48] them that's right that's I want to know
[48:50] a man meet an angel I I Hallelujah Glory
[48:54] what the angel say angel is say nothing
[48:57] well I don't want to hear nothing from
[48:58] you because that's a nothing talking
[49:00] angel that's a dumb Angel then God has
[49:02] send that angel God don't send no dumb
[49:04] Angel when God s an angel the angel have
[49:07] a message so if you tell me the angel
[49:09] only see you and size you up and get a
[49:10] cookie eye and get your blink eye and
[49:12] whatnot I don't want to hear about that
[49:14] angel I don't want to hear that
[49:15] testimony tell me what that angel say is
[49:17] that angel speaking according to the
[49:19] word because Paul said if an angel come
[49:21] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[49:24] tell him go back where he come from oh
[49:26] give the Lord I shout in the house so I
[49:28] talking to man angel angel with wings
[49:31] whatever Angel bring your angel and come
[49:33] oh get the Lord a shout in the house all
[49:36] the men who claim to have me angel and
[49:37] this Angel bring your angel and come
[49:39] bring your testimony and come I want to
[49:41] hear what the angel say if the angel
[49:43] speaking according to the word because
[49:44] when BR was in the seals he said he
[49:46] check what the angel told him with the
[49:48] word of God oh give the Lord a shout he
[49:51] didn't just take what the angel say he
[49:53] compare what was being revealed with the
[49:55] scriptures
[49:57] that's the only Authority we have to try
[50:00] things by the
[50:03] word man mustn't establish
[50:06] yourself they are trying to establish
[50:10] themselves every man I did this me I
[50:14] mine I'm still
[50:15] reading my denomination me this
[50:19] establishing themselves what are we
[50:21] preaching about ourselves or the kingdom
[50:24] of God
[50:28] and that was such a fantastic thing
[50:30] about brother Peter Chandler you never
[50:32] hear him preach about
[50:33] himself it was always the
[50:36] kingdom he was a kingdom
[50:39] man but Bram establish the word of God
[50:43] take out the unbelief and establish the
[50:46] kingdom of God in a man's heart and the
[50:49] kingdom of God cannot be establish in a
[50:51] man Hearts lest God me that man thus oh
[50:54] my all right here we go
[50:57] now the Greek word for Revelation is
[50:58] apocalypse which means the
[51:00] unveiling the unveiling is perfectly
[51:03] described in the example of the
[51:04] sculpture unveiling his work of Statuary
[51:07] exposing it to an UNL her it is an
[51:10] uncovering revealing what was previously
[51:13] hidden now the uncovering is not only
[51:15] the revelation of the person of Christ
[51:17] but it is the revelation of his Future
[51:19] Works in the uncoming seven Church ages
[51:22] now hear this the importance of
[51:25] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[51:30] Believer can never be
[51:33] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[51:36] you than perhaps you realize now I am
[51:39] not talking about this book of
[51:40] Revelation and you I'm talking about all
[51:44] Revelation Give the Lord a shout on that
[51:48] all
[51:49] Revelation now part of the Revelation
[51:52] itself is you coming to a realization or
[51:55] a revelation that you are a son of
[52:00] God so you have to get a revelation of
[52:03] your
[52:04] sunship and as a son or a daughter you
[52:06] have
[52:08] access to
[52:10] [Applause]
[52:13] Revelation Hallelujah so when you talk
[52:15] about revelation God talking about you
[52:18] as a son it's going to come to you oh my
[52:21] do you get that now let me say it again
[52:24] now I'm not talking about the Book of
[52:25] Revelation I'm talking about all
[52:28] Revelation it is tremendously important
[52:31] to the church and then brother quote
[52:33] Matthew 16 what we read and then he says
[52:35] the Roman Catholics said the church is
[52:36] built upon Peter now that's carnal how
[52:39] could God build his church Upon A man so
[52:40] unstable that he n the Lord and so on
[52:42] like God cannot build his church upon
[52:45] any man born in sin now brother George
[52:47] that statement is loaded that mean all
[52:49] them so-called Minister man and who is
[52:52] the Angel and who had angel with them
[52:54] and who up there somewhere and who
[52:56] revealing son of man and Son of Man
[52:58] Ministry and the Second Son of Man Son
[53:00] of Man part two part three part four and
[53:02] all of that all that stuff God not
[53:04] building Church on
[53:07] that God can't build his church upon any
[53:11] man born in
[53:13] sin so them guys had to be virgin born
[53:16] you know if they want to claim to be
[53:17] building Church virgin born you know
[53:20] because once they born in sin they are
[53:22] liars got to come down there low here
[53:26] come through here except to see it
[53:29] so they are Trinidad Liars Li I I can
[53:33] talk about Liars from other places I go
[53:35] to the Liars right here in this country
[53:37] Here Local Liars then local Liars Hall
[53:40] Local Liars all right so God here we go
[53:43] again I love this quote tonight God
[53:45] can't build his church upon any man born
[53:48] in sin it wasn't some rock Ling there
[53:52] God hadn't hollowed that spot it was the
[53:54] Revelation read it the way it is written
[53:56] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but
[53:59] my father had revealed it and Upon This
[54:02] Rock Revelation I will build my church
[54:05] the church is built on the Revelation
[54:07] and th sayth the Lord hallelujah what
[54:11] did the word spoken to the prophet said
[54:13] pick a pen and write the bride will have
[54:16] thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still
[54:19] so what we preaching should
[54:21] be th say the Lord not could it be
[54:27] it have some solar something coming
[54:28] could it be what if it is what if it's
[54:31] not is
[54:33] Lotto could be a crab could be a snake
[54:35] could be you know you're gambling so we
[54:37] don't want to hear could it be could it
[54:39] be could it be that consolation means
[54:41] that could it be remember when when it
[54:45] had um what is it called um uh 1999 um
[54:50] and they
[54:52] say white 2K and Minister preaching
[54:54] white 2K and white 2K and I why on Earth
[54:58] is
[54:58] 2K I never touched that as far as I Y 2
[55:03] ZK whatever that not what I preaching
[55:06] that that is not what promise they could
[55:08] do what they want out
[55:10] there Lucifer had to do with stuff but
[55:13] we have to do our
[55:19] stuff on this rock Revelation I been my
[55:21] church the church is built upon
[55:23] revelation of God so what's something
[55:26] now now how did Abel know what to do in
[55:28] order to offer proper sacrifice to God
[55:30] how did Abel know that by faith he
[55:32] received the revelation of the blood
[55:34] Kain didn't get such a revelation ahuh
[55:38] you mean some people get Revelation some
[55:39] don't exactly and he is Sovereign he
[55:42] revealed it to whomsoever he will so
[55:45] that mean he can reveal it to you
[55:46] tonight without asking anybody's
[55:48] permission and give you Revelation you
[55:51] could be backed in 40 years and God give
[55:53] her sin tonight and restore you from
[55:54] your condition by giving you Revelation
[55:57] oh give the Lord some Praises it was
[56:00] Revelation from God that made the
[56:02] difference and G Abel eternal life here
[56:05] this part here's this BM now now you
[56:07] might take what the pastor says or what
[56:10] the Seminary teaches and though it might
[56:13] be taught to you with
[56:17] eloquence a sweet talker boy the words
[56:20] come like oil out his mouth with
[56:21] eloquence until here we go God reveals
[56:25] to you that Jesus is the Christ and that
[56:28] it is his blood that cleanses you and
[56:29] that God is your savior you will never
[56:31] have eternal
[56:33] life still comes back to divine
[56:35] revelation after Hidden Mysteries
[56:38] Mysteries inside of mysteries and all
[56:40] kind of mysteries and this same brother
[56:43] don't like
[56:45] Mysteries but BR he said a new birth is
[56:48] a revelation oh the ministers love that
[56:51] one boy oh we Revelation they don't want
[56:55] to talk about experience
[56:57] but he also said the new birth is an
[57:00] experience question which one comes
[57:04] first both statements are true both
[57:08] statements are correct if we only hook
[57:10] up to the one saying the new B is
[57:11] revelation then the more we talk the
[57:14] more the people walk without any
[57:17] experience but if you try to balance it
[57:19] and take it down the middle you would
[57:22] see something Hallelujah that you never
[57:24] saw before Hallelujah so what something
[57:26] now Jude said contend for the faith that
[57:30] was once delivered to the Saints so the
[57:32] first stage of Faith which I'm talking
[57:35] about Abram came to the fullness of
[57:36] believing the first stage of faith is
[57:38] always a battle because you're holding
[57:41] on to a revelation or a promise of a
[57:46] truth of God that is not real to you by
[57:49] experience oh give the Lord a shout not
[57:53] real to you by experience but said so
[57:57] Hallelujah and you're holding on for
[57:59] your children and you're holding on for
[58:01] your husband and you're holding on for
[58:02] your wife and you're holding on for your
[58:04] healing and you're holding on for your
[58:05] deliverance it's not real yet but it's a
[58:08] fith Oh Glory to God there things you're
[58:11] hoping for it is not yet but it's
[58:14] revealed to you and you're holding on to
[58:16] it you're holding on for Isaac Isaac
[58:18] coming doctors run your the office but
[58:20] Isaac still coming Oh Glory to God it's
[58:23] not yet real to you but you're holding
[58:25] on
[58:27] that's the first stage because God said
[58:29] so oh glory to God and you find out many
[58:33] people have experiences but no
[58:35] Revelation so then that's there a whole
[58:37] tie up thing so what did God do when
[58:40] Jesus resurrected and appear to the
[58:43] disciples he didn't go to multiply bread
[58:46] and fish he didn't go down in the in in
[58:49] in in The Villages and so on just a
[58:51] private Ministry to do what open the
[58:54] understanding and open up the word
[58:56] Hallelujah and he was bringing them this
[58:57] what was telling you all along while I
[58:59] was with you here it is here here it is
[59:02] here here it is here here it is there
[59:04] what they were getting Revelation then
[59:06] he breathed upon them receive the Holy
[59:08] Ghost so now they have Revelation they
[59:11] have the Breath of God upon them as a
[59:13] promise that is come in my experience
[59:15] hey glory to God do you get it now he
[59:18] opened the word he open the
[59:20] understanding he breathed the Breath of
[59:22] God upon them that was not the promise
[59:25] that was a promise itself that the
[59:27] Breath of God will come upon you
[59:29] Hallelujah before that he said I can't
[59:32] leave you comfortless I'll come to you a
[59:34] little while the world see at me know
[59:36] but you going to see me at that day you
[59:38] shall know you're going to get an
[59:40] experience you hear any talk now at that
[59:42] day but you're going to actually
[59:44] experience it I am with you but I'm
[59:46] going to be in you oh give the Lord some
[59:48] Praises oh give the Lord a shout in the
[59:50] house so he knew that had was to come
[59:53] from Revelation to experience they was
[59:56] coming down to the upper room we give
[59:57] the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah
[1:00:01] so the test of the Revelation is to see
[1:00:03] that you will not stagger you wouldn't
[1:00:05] get throw off you're not supposed to get
[1:00:07] throw off because he said Upon This Rock
[1:00:09] if is a rock hallelujah the gates of
[1:00:12] hell can Prevail against it Oh Glory to
[1:00:15] God something bigger than you something
[1:00:18] more than you you an experience your
[1:00:20] promise yet but you have a rock you have
[1:00:23] a revelation you have a new wine inside
[1:00:26] your soul God has broken upon you
[1:00:29] hallelujah hallelujah and when you
[1:00:32] finish get that approval from God now
[1:00:35] you accept your faith and send fire send
[1:00:38] fire to confirm the faith has been
[1:00:42] receive Fire come off the altar Oh Glory
[1:00:45] to God to circumcise your heart that God
[1:00:48] have received your Fai isn't that
[1:00:50] something now Hallelujah so before they
[1:00:53] receive the experience in the upper room
[1:00:56] yeah God open the understanding to the
[1:00:59] scriptures and the fold Ministry have to
[1:01:02] be able to experience not only get
[1:01:04] Revelation but
[1:01:06] experience along with the Revelation
[1:01:08] because he said the fful ministry is to
[1:01:11] pour the virtues into the people and you
[1:01:14] cannot do that by Revelation oh give
[1:01:16] come on preach back to me somebody that
[1:01:18] has to be done by experience we cannot

[1:05:11] a consumation the two become one and
[1:05:14] listen to what the prophet said here now
[1:05:16] from God evil age but in obedience this

[1:05:30] the promise of the age to be
[1:05:32] confirmed she is watching for it she is
[1:05:36] part of that word how by Revelation she
[1:05:39] is watching for her life to manifest
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:42] word brethren can't you see that I hope
[1:05:46] that didn't go for you the body is

[1:05:51] word is waiting for the life which is
[1:05:54] the spirit Amen to confirm or make it
[1:05:57] alive so the spirit in the upper room
[1:06:00] brought the experience of all
[1:06:03] Revelations that Jesus unveiled to them
[1:06:06] when he opened the understanding and
[1:06:07] opened the word to them the spirit
[1:06:09] brought us as a confirmation so when
[1:06:11] Peter steep forward coward Peter denying
[1:06:14] Peter when he's forward and he said this
[1:06:17] is that that's right he can identify it
[1:06:21] he makes sure there is no error there
[1:06:23] not no General inspiration this
[1:06:26] is that then the prophet said what we
[1:06:29] see should make a church that would make
[1:06:32] a Revival that they we say the seven

[1:07:15] Ghost itself which is the person of
[1:07:17] Christ you shall receive power when when

[1:07:25] Ghost ghost itself the Pentecostal
[1:07:27] didn't have the Holy Ghost itself they
[1:07:29] had a birth the Holy Ghost come by the
[1:07:31] restoration of the word because the word
[1:07:33] was lost through seven ages and the
[1:07:35] revelation of Malachi 4 was to gather
[1:07:37] the scattered word to tie back into the
[1:07:39] word to bring down the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:42] the entire Holy Ghost is what visited
[1:07:44] the church in the last day bringing all
[1:07:46] these precious promises that by these
[1:07:48] promises we can be partakers of his

[1:12:42] morning Satan come

[1:13:01] when one word and then you go ahead and
[1:13:04] serve
[1:13:07] him but Stephen this is this is a
[1:13:10] lot all the human reasoning that's right
[1:13:14] why should i serve him if he won't even
[1:13:17] as much as look down at my baby and take
[1:13:20] it all and and take all as much as I had
[1:13:24] thought I had done done for him then he
[1:13:27] would have even listened to my own baby
[1:13:29] that was the hardest temptation all
[1:13:31] human reasons had broke away why should
[1:13:34] i serve him if I can't do that much for
[1:13:37] me can't he can't do that much for me I
[1:13:39] go day and night for him he even refuses
[1:13:41] to tell me what I've done well human
[1:13:42] reason was
[1:13:44] gone when a man is born
[1:13:47] again that something in there that
[1:13:50] holds it come down to a spot when I
[1:13:53] thought where did I get her
[1:13:56] where did she come from what am I anyhow
[1:14:00] where did I come from all the human part
[1:14:03] had broke away then that real genuine
[1:14:08] spirit of God laid there I walk over to
[1:14:11] her and put my hands on her head she was
[1:14:13] suffering so bad till a little eye was
[1:14:15] crossing together I said sweetheart in a
[1:14:18] few minutes I will take you and lay you
[1:14:20] on mommy's arms out there in the M think
[1:14:23] about it a 23y old old speaking I'll
[1:14:26] bury you out here under the pine trees
[1:14:29] and someday daddy will see you again I
[1:14:32] looked up and I said God do you slay
[1:14:38] me yet I trust you Hallelujah you give
[1:14:43] her you taken her away blessed be the
[1:14:48] name of the Lord is only when you come
[1:14:50] into the test area the test field you
[1:14:53] would really see what's inside
[1:15:00] it's something to learn you can't rock
[1:15:01] back on your preaching on your ministry
[1:15:03] and your calling how long in Ministry
[1:15:04] how long in this how long you're serving
[1:15:06] how long you're Deacon how long you're
[1:15:07] Elder you can't rock back on that
[1:15:09] something have to be
[1:15:12] deeper for then all my human reason had
[1:15:16] vanished I was at the end of my road but
[1:15:19] when you come to the end of the road
[1:15:21] There Is that real spirit of God dear to
[1:15:25] take over at that time and lift you up
[1:15:28] you must be born
[1:15:30] again everything had to die away all
[1:15:33] your theology all your thinking all ever
[1:15:36] expect to be in your life everything
[1:15:37] else dies away and then the Holy Spirit
[1:15:39] comes in so when the Holy Spirit is back
[1:15:43] there and you're dying and the human
[1:15:45] Spirit breaks up all your human
[1:15:46] reasoning all your your gcsx your
[1:15:49] doctorate whatever just breaks up your
[1:15:50] soul is what coming up to God your
[1:15:53] subconscious the real you if there's
[1:15:56] nothing there what going to raise that's
[1:15:58] why when that woman when she was
[1:16:00] deceived by the preacher and when her
[1:16:02] soul when her all her reason in had to
[1:16:04] break up and her soul had to come she
[1:16:06] she said I'm lost I'm lost she
[1:16:09] recognized she was lost it too late we
[1:16:11] can't correct it on all the correction
[1:16:13] had to be made here all the repentance
[1:16:15] had to be here all all straight up had
[1:16:17] to be here oh glory to God so the spirit
[1:16:21] of the Lord is here to change you
[1:16:23] Hallelujah from a revelation huah to an
[1:16:26] experience but brandham says faith in
[1:16:29] God it's a staggering thing to many
[1:16:31] people and yet we ought to be ashamed of
[1:16:33] ourselves to confess that we don't have
[1:16:35] faith in God first there's cowards who
[1:16:38] die 10,000 deaths while they are here on
[1:16:40] Earth but hero Never Dies his memory
[1:16:43] lingers for a great heroic deeds and
[1:16:45] usually people who have faith here we go
[1:16:47] are people who have experience
[1:16:50] experience brings faith we know about
[1:16:51] faith come here and here in the word but
[1:16:53] there another side the balance that off
[1:16:56] Oh Glory to God not intellectually
[1:16:57] sitting in church there we go let me say
[1:16:59] it again usually people who have faith
[1:17:01] are people who have experience
[1:17:03] experience bring fate Oh Glory to God if
[1:17:06] David didn't step out and deal with the
[1:17:08] bear and deal with the lion he couldn't
[1:17:11] have the faith to deal with golad his
[1:17:13] experience On The Backs side of the
[1:17:15] desert he had a revelation that God was
[1:17:17] with him the god that delivered me out
[1:17:20] of the bear out of the lion will deliver
[1:17:23] me from this golad oh give the Lord a
[1:17:26] shout friends you can't be content to
[1:17:28] sit in church and just hear word word

[1:17:44] encourage
[1:17:46] somebody hallu glory to God glory to God
[1:17:51] let's say it again usually people who
[1:17:53] have faith are people who who have
[1:17:55] experience Hallelujah experience brings
[1:17:58] Faith so it behooves us to have an
[1:18:01] experience before faith can accomplish
[1:18:04] very much so what that tells us the
[1:18:07] message have a lot of I call that M
[1:18:09] Champions

[1:23:59] this one question and answers does the
[1:24:02] sons of God mean Angels or Spirits from
[1:24:04] Heaven that's the person question I
[1:24:08] believe there wasn't Angels they were
[1:24:09] beings sons of God like the scripture
[1:24:11] says not Angels they were sons of godj
[1:24:14] they come from Heaven to Earth and was
[1:24:15] put into flesh not press themselves into
[1:24:17] flesh I believe all flesh is born sexual
[1:24:20] outside of Jesus Christ I believe he's
[1:24:22] the only virgin born being that ever was
[1:24:26] I don't agree with Josephus and that
[1:24:27] great historian but I do believe that
[1:24:29] there were supernatural beings that come
[1:24:31] down and took over the spirit of man I
[1:24:33] believe they are right here yet today
[1:24:36] still walking around in jville today
[1:24:38] some of them beastly lustfully ungodly
[1:24:43] spirits that live right in human beings
[1:24:46] hear these
[1:24:47] words now
[1:24:49] someday these men will
[1:24:52] die if there's another generation they
[1:24:56] will come right down on
[1:25:00] them remember God takes his man but
[1:25:04] never his spirit this is this the bomb I
[1:25:07] want to get to you this is the same Holy
[1:25:10] Spirit they receive on
[1:25:14] Pentecost we could close there
[1:25:16] tonight that I say there's no mother
[1:25:19] holy ghost in know so when a man die
[1:25:21] evil spirit right that man dead and gone
[1:25:23] the spirit spirit and him come and fall
[1:25:25] on next
[1:25:28] generation and just as an evil spirit
[1:25:30] could fall Next Generation the Holy
[1:25:33] Ghost same Holy
[1:25:36] Ghost so when the prophet said when a
[1:25:38] church is believing on the promise of
[1:25:41] the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was
[1:25:45] on the day of Pentecost when they are
[1:25:47] born and positionally born then God sets
[1:25:51] in the church pastors teachers prophet
[1:25:53] aband not a man saying I'm a pastor I'm
[1:25:55] a teacher a liar that's not the
[1:25:57] scripture that's not what the prophet
[1:25:59] reveal it has to be the ministry of
[1:26:01] Jesus Christ when they are born and
[1:26:03] positionally born then God sets in the
[1:26:05] church you believe in what the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost is just as real Peter was a
[1:26:10] fisherman Peter was a denier Peter was a
[1:26:13] CBD but when that fire dropped upon him

[1:29:44] religious Jesus came to a bunch of men
[1:29:47] that was holy priest and he kept the
[1:29:48] laws to the letter and they were very
[1:29:50] religious John called them you gener
[1:29:53] vipers that is n who wanted to flee when

[1:30:09] into your life and sanctifies your
[1:30:11] spirit and lives through you and gives
[1:30:14] you power to live and when your spirit
[1:30:16] goes on your spirit is kept with God but

[1:30:28] time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go

[1:30:55] part of God and eternal with him then
[1:30:58] death cannot touch you when you are born
[1:31:00] again you are Eternal you can't love
[1:31:03] Mammon which is the world and love God
[1:31:06] at the same time he that loves me not
[1:31:09] keep not my sins Oh Glory to God oh

[1:33:15] nothing but he's speaking
[1:33:18] eloquently brother Brandon notice you
[1:33:21] can't make yourself
[1:33:24] please notice you can't make yourself
[1:33:26] anything different from what God
[1:33:27] intended you to be until what therefore
[1:33:31] if your conversion is only you're trying
[1:33:33] to hide behind something or trying to
[1:33:35] make yourself better person you you only
[1:33:36] playing a part of a hypocrite here we go
[1:33:39] until Christ has actually come to your
[1:33:43] life and changed you and brought you
[1:33:47] into an atmosphere that is the
[1:33:50] difference something that is happened
[1:33:54] he's talking about an experience a
[1:33:56] conversion of the heart that has changed
[1:33:59] you and brought you into another
[1:34:02] realm Oh Glory to God brother Brandon
[1:34:05] brother sister we trying to make
[1:34:07] denominations we're trying to build
[1:34:08] churches we trying to organize people
[1:34:09] educate them it's all in vain until the
[1:34:13] love of God comes in you want to speak
[1:34:15] in tongues you want to clap your hands
[1:34:17] you want to jump you want to dance you
[1:34:18] want to do certain things to make
[1:34:20] yourself a Christian you will never be
[1:34:21] until the love of God takes over in your
[1:34:24] heart and tears that middle out and
[1:34:26] makes you feel for your brother
[1:34:29] Hallelujah so this attitude this one is
[1:34:31] shock and you cut this one off you want
[1:34:32] to talk to this one what not Holy Ghost
[1:34:34] you know that sulfuric acid until the
[1:34:37] church come to that butram she's a total

[1:36:04] no way in which to gain patience
[1:36:06] tribulation work patience how highly God
[1:36:08] regardless at working of our patience is
[1:36:10] seen in James 1:4 let patience have a
[1:36:12] perfect work Watch God's will for us is
[1:36:15] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:36:18] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:36:21] God this is the process of character
[1:36:25] development I'm going to
[1:36:28] close there's nobody greater than God he
