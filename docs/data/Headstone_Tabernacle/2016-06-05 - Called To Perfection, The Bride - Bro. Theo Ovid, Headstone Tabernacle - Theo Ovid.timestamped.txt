[3:14] Psalm chapter
[3:16] 46. Amen. From verse one says, "God is
[3:19] our refuge and strength, a very present
[3:23] help in trouble. Therefore will not we
[3:27] fear, though the earth be removed, and
[3:29] though the mountains be carried into the
[3:31] midst of the sea, though the waters
[3:33] thereof roar and be troubled, though the
[3:36] mountains shake with the swelling
[3:38] thereof, sailor, there is a river, the
[3:41] streams whereof shall make glad the city
[3:44] of God, the holy place of the
[3:46] tabernacles of the most high. God is in
[3:49] the midst of her, and she shall not be
[3:51] moved. God shall help her. And that
[3:55] right early, the heathen raged, the
[3:58] kingdoms were moved. He uttered his
[4:00] voice and the earth melted. The Lord of
[4:03] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[4:06] our refuge. Salem. May God add blessing
[4:10] to the ring of his word. Let's lift our
[4:12] hands now and close our eyes and welcome
[4:15] the presence of the Lord in this place.
[4:17] And let's invite his his spirit with

[4:42] wherever he's invited. Father, we invite
[4:45] you in this place. We invite you in this
[4:48] tabernacle. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God.

[4:54] father. We thank you for your presence
[4:57] Lord. Lord that is among your people. Oh

[5:02] the Lord is there is liberty Lord. And

[5:25] your son coming to us, Lord, and dying,
[5:28] giving your life that we could have
[5:30] liberty through your name, Jesus.
[5:32] Father, we pray you bless the service
[5:33] this morning. Bless each one as they
[5:35] praise and worship you. May your
[5:37] anointing come down and touch them and
[5:38] minister to each heart, Lord, we pray
[5:40] your word go forth with power, Lord, and
[5:42] such an anointing, Lord, Father. Lord,
[5:45] that it would cut the doubt away from
[5:46] us, Lord. Lord, that would cut fear and
[5:49] and wickedness away from us, Father.
[5:51] Lord, that we could press on towards the
[5:53] mark of the high calling, Lord, that we
[5:55] could press on to perfection this
[5:56] morning. Granted, Almighty God, we pray
[5:59] and ask these things today. Have your

[30:05] We are dependent upon you. Without you,
[30:08] we can do anything. Bless your word.
[30:10] Bless your people, Father. In Jesus name
[30:13] we ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless
[30:16] you. And I want to go straight into the
[30:19] word. No comments. We have Matthew
[30:21] chapter 5 1 verse verse 48. We have 1
[30:25] Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 and 10.
[30:28] Hebrews chapter 6 1 verse1. Thank you
[30:32] musicians. My what's singing this
[30:35] morning my mind is blown. Uh sometime
[30:38] when I speaking I'm talking about
[30:40] oldfashioned or homecooked fire when
[30:43] everybody bring the fire from home and
[30:45] then they put it together in the church
[30:47] we have a real bonfire and I feel that
[30:50] that that that's what we have this
[30:51] morning. Amen. And I'm so appreciative
[30:55] of that that you are applying the word.
[30:58] I could feel it. Feel the
[31:00] anointing. My goodness. Oh, we are
[31:03] grateful to God. So, read in Matthew
[31:06] chapter 5, want to read verse
[31:10] 48. Be therefore
[31:12] perfect, even as your father which is in
[31:16] heaven is perfect.
[31:18] And from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 9 and
[31:23] 10. For we know in
[31:25] part and we prophesy in part. But when
[31:30] that which is perfect is come, then that
[31:33] which is in part shall be done
[31:36] away. We also go to Hebrews chapter 6
[31:40] verse one.
[31:43] Therefore, leaving the principles of the
[31:46] doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
[31:49] perfection. Amen. Not laying again the
[31:52] foundation of repentance from dead works
[31:54] and of faith towards God. Let us pray.
[31:57] Father, we thank you for the reading of
[31:59] your word. Any man could read the
[32:01] scriptures. We have had scriptures read
[32:03] for so many years. But it will take the
[32:05] Holy Ghost to come and anoint the word
[32:08] and breathe life and fire and presence
[32:11] and power and deliverance and quicken
[32:14] the word to the people. Father, may the
[32:17] ministry of the spirit be effective
[32:19] today in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and
[32:23] amen. Before you have your seats, I want
[32:24] you to turn around and shake somebody
[32:26] hands and greet somebody in Jesus name.
[32:28] Just before you have your seats,
[32:48] Oh, glory. You may be seated when you
[32:51] Amen. Give the Lord some praises as you
[32:53] take your seats.
[32:55] [Applause]
[33:01] It's always a privilege to be in the
[33:03] presence of God. Amen. Amen. To be under
[33:06] the anointing of the spirit. Amen. Oh
[33:09] god. Just think without the spirit of
[33:13] God, we're just another group of people.
[33:15] A Sunday morning just gathering together
[33:17] and meeting each other and shaking each
[33:19] other's hands. When the spirit of God is
[33:22] here, hallelujah, makes a whole
[33:24] difference in the entire world. Amen.
[33:27] Amen. Praise the
[33:30] Lord. There are some who in life are
[33:33] called into different
[33:35] vocations,
[33:36] careers, positions. Example, to be a
[33:39] writer, a doctor, a teacher, mechanic,
[33:42] farmer, an engineer, a father, minister.
[33:45] But besides all of
[33:47] that or in addition to that, Amen.
[33:51] there's another calling.
[33:53] A higher calling. Hallelujah. This call
[33:56] differentiates them from
[33:58] others. This is a call to perfection.
[34:02] Hallelujah.
[34:04] There are some who are great family
[34:06] persons. They genuinely love and care
[34:09] about the family, but besides that,
[34:12] there still remain a higher calling.
[34:16] There are those who are content and
[34:18] satisfied. Nothing moves them. Nothing
[34:21] really inspires or motivates them. They
[34:24] have it all figured out how it should
[34:26] be, how they want it, how they see it,
[34:30] and according to where they are in life,
[34:32] they control everything around them.
[34:34] Especially if they have money, power and
[34:38] position.
[34:41] There are those who are not fortunate to
[34:43] be in money, power or position. Life
[34:45] just swirls around them. All right?
[34:47] Things happen to them
[34:50] and around them. Hallelujah. There are
[34:52] those who somebody always do them,
[34:57] hurt them,
[34:59] affect them, stumble them, hinder them,
[35:04] there are those who choose to be lazy,
[35:07] have no ambition, no desire for
[35:09] anything. Life is just so for them. Life
[35:12] just happens. They are no better off in
[35:15] spirit, in attitude and behavior after
[35:17] 5, 10, 15 years. They are the same
[35:20] person. They always was.
[35:24] All types go to church. All say amen.
[35:29] But there's a bunch of individuals among
[35:31] those who are called now to perfection.
[35:35] Amen.
[35:37] Something drives them. Hallelujah. A
[35:40] purpose, a deep, an unexplained
[35:43] something that drives them to dig
[35:46] deeper, climb higher. Hallelujah. Press
[35:49] further.
[35:51] Certain keywords connect to these types.
[35:55] I press towards the mark, forgetting the
[35:58] things that are passed. I can do all
[36:00] things through Christ.
[36:03] Let us go on to perfection. Amen.
[36:06] Earnestly contending for the faith.
[36:08] These are actionable words, things to
[36:12] apply and effect change in one's life.
[36:16] Hallelujah. A call to perfection. Only
[36:19] the bride will have that call. Some are
[36:22] called to follow the message. Some are
[36:24] called to follow a church. Some are
[36:26] called to follow family, follow a
[36:28] preacher or minister or church or
[36:31] congregation that they love. Take them
[36:33] out of that congregation. They are lost.
[36:35] They can't find happiness. For them,
[36:38] it's church choosing the minister of
[36:41] their choosing. They have a real
[36:43] struggle to struggle. They have a
[36:45] problem to accept.
[36:47] Praise God. Hallelujah. That all things
[36:50] work together for good to them that love
[36:52] God. Hallelujah. They have a problem to
[36:55] accept that nothing takes God by
[36:57] surprise. God doesn't wave his eye, open
[37:00] his eyes big like something surprised
[37:02] him. They have trouble accepting that
[37:04] nothing takes God by surprise.
[37:07] Hallelujah. They have problems accepting
[37:09] trials, accepting testings, accepting
[37:12] tribulation. They really don't want any
[37:15] of that. God is not at their center
[37:19] point. Hal God is not their center
[37:21] point. God
[37:23] is Oh, hallelujah.
[37:26] Money is.
[37:29] God is not their center point. The
[37:32] family is.
[37:33] God is not their center point. Self is.
[37:37] I, me, I. God. The word is a reference
[37:41] point. is like a dictionary, a book that
[37:44] you check the meaning of the word.
[37:45] Sometimes there is no real burden to see
[37:48] God, to see his power, to see his glory.
[37:52] There is a no daily life is a daily
[37:55] judge.
[37:59] But there are some
[38:01] who are called
[38:03] to perfection.
[38:06] And the title of the message this
[38:07] morning is called to perfection. Amen.
[38:10] the bride.
[38:13] That's my title this morning. Call to
[38:16] perfection the bride and an inspiration
[38:19] when that which is perfect is come.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] Gal feeling good to be here tonight.
[38:31] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38:34] Hallelujah.
[38:35] So now we come down where the tire hits
[38:38] the road. Amen.
[38:41] Come down to the real deal. Yes sir.
[38:43] Know in part,
[38:46] prophesy in part, accept a lot of things
[38:49] in part. There comes a when part is no
[38:53] longer you know good enough. Amen. You
[38:56] you see when you know when when when
[38:59] better is expected good is not good
[39:00] enough. When it reach where it's a
[39:03] standard and a requirement where it
[39:06] comes to the higher calling all of a
[39:08] sudden you find yourself naked.
[39:09] Hallelujah. You find yourself undone.
[39:11] You find yourself needing to come up to
[39:13] meet God requirement. That is what this
[39:16] means. Let us go on to perfection. The
[39:18] bride being called to that perfection.
[39:22] So it would mean allowing Christ to move
[39:24] in every area of yourself and life. Let
[39:28] me change those words. Allowing Christ
[39:31] to invade your self life.
[39:35] Your human spirit. Amen. Not just have
[39:38] Christ on a Sunday morning, the
[39:39] anointing and the presence and you you
[39:41] get a quote and you read a get a
[39:43] scripture. No, no, no, no. But but it
[39:44] becomes a daily inventory, a daily
[39:48] connecting with a daily receiving of and
[39:51] from. Now you understand why the prophet
[39:54] said, "Read your Bible and pray every
[39:55] day." And you're going to grow.
[39:58] Hallelujah. Not live in church. Some
[40:00] people who they feel they could live in
[40:01] church. They wish the church had rooms
[40:05] where they could stay away from the
[40:06] devil
[40:10] away from trials.
[40:12] You're only hearing songs and psalms
[40:14] like angels singing harp playing.
[40:22] But the Bible said the trial of your
[40:23] faith being more precious than gold. And
[40:28] and you see God come and bring you a
[40:30] conversation to get tried of your faith
[40:32] inside the church. Some people go to
[40:34] church and get fight. I do understand
[40:36] that. I'm not going there. But the thing
[40:39] of it is is when you leave here, Yes,
[40:42] sir. when you get out there, then give
[40:46] God the opportunity
[40:48] and give the devil an opportunity to see
[40:51] what you hear and what you really
[40:52] believe.
[40:52] [Applause]
[40:58] As far as devil concern, you went to you
[41:00] going to you you going to hear things.
[41:02] Amen. Amen. He not even sure you believe
[41:05] those things you are hearing. And he
[41:07] have a right to investigate that.
[41:12] But God using him
[41:16] to fix you. Right.
[41:19] You're not hearing what I'm saying. You
[41:22] You're not hearing what I'm
[41:23] saying? If you understand that, you will
[41:26] thank God that the devil is a good
[41:28] adversary.
[41:35] And God made you worthy of combat.
[41:39] You hear what I'm saying?
[41:42] Qualified to loose you on the You don't
[41:45] put a new recruit, new recruit on the
[41:47] battlefield. You have to get trained
[41:50] that God to put you on life's
[41:53] battle fulfilled.
[41:56] So really and truly it have no room to
[41:59] be children. Be no more children. Get
[42:03] your boots. Get your clothes because we
[42:06] are going
[42:12] somewhere. Oh glory to God. So some
[42:16] point in time that which is perfect must
[42:19] come and then we have to step up now to
[42:22] meet up with it. Oh glory to God. Could
[42:24] we give the Lord a shout?
[42:27] Hallelujah.
[42:30] So he's allowing the Holy Spirit to come
[42:33] and influence your human
[42:38] personality. You living and walking and
[42:40] moving and applying the presence of God.
[42:44] Hallelujah. There are too many who
[42:46] contend just to be saved, just to be
[42:49] message babies and they're looking for
[42:51] pampers every service and diapers.
[42:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[42:56] Hallelujah. Isn't that something? There
[42:59] are those nobody could tell them
[43:01] anything.
[43:03] Not even the
[43:04] husband, wife, not even the pastor.
[43:08] They are truly on their own. Amen. They
[43:12] want to run their life their own way,
[43:16] by their own emotions, by their own
[43:19] fancies. Amen. Whatever come, whatever
[43:22] they want, they want. And if they don't
[43:24] get that, they get they're going to
[43:24] attract. They throw a tantrum.
[43:27] As if that's what children do. You know,
[43:29] that's what children do. They throw
[43:32] tantrums. And you see God, God have no
[43:34] time with that.
[43:36] God would leave you in a tantrum. And
[43:38] when you finish, you still God.
[43:44] God will leave you in trouble and when
[43:45] he finish you still God until you
[43:48] understand he had no time with that
[43:50] because the whole creation is groaning
[43:52] struggling travailing for the
[43:55] manifestation of not children of the
[43:58] sons of God when born sons mature sons
[44:02] responsible sons qualified sons anointed
[44:06] sons trained sons sons who fell and rise
[44:09] back up. Sons who get knocked back down
[44:11] and knock up and come back up. Oh,
[44:13] rugged sons. God see sons. Overcoming
[44:16] sons. Sons who not afraid to fail
[44:19] because failure doesn't make you a
[44:21] failure. Failing doesn't make you a
[44:25] failure. Failing doesn't make you a
[44:29] failure. Oh, give the Lord a shout. We
[44:32] have a
[44:33] word from the Lord for you today.
[44:44] Hallelujah.
[44:46] You must want an experience with the
[44:48] word.
[44:50] Amen. I'll repeat that. You must want
[44:55] an experience with God said. So,
[45:03] I don't care what your feelings tell
[45:04] you. It's what God said. You have to
[45:07] experience the word against your
[45:10] feelings. The word against your
[45:13] emotions, the word against your better
[45:15] judgment.
[45:21] Did you get that?
[45:23] If Isaiah was studying his thinking and
[45:26] his mind, when God say say a virgin
[45:28] shall conceive, Isaiah would say, uh,
[45:31] Isaiah would say, could you repeat that?
[45:35] Yeah, but Isaiah was in that mood. When
[45:40] God said virgin conceive, he shall
[45:41] virgin conceive. Have no How could a
[45:44] virgin Could you Did you show you me?
[45:48] Do you really want me to
[45:51] to say that? No. No. The these guys not
[45:55] using the head. This holy men moved by
[45:59] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost bypassing
[46:02] the head and striking the heart and the
[46:04] heart going to the mouth to speak the
[46:07] word right out. So these guys was only
[46:09] speaking what God put upon the heart.
[46:13] One time a man come and say speak what
[46:16] everybody else say and he said I only
[46:17] speak what God put in my mouth. I can't
[46:20] speak what I feel to speak. I can't
[46:22] speak. God not allowing me to do that
[46:24] because the word comes to me. The word
[46:26] of the Lord came to Jeremiah. The word
[46:29] of the Lord came to Ezekiel. The word of
[46:31] the Lord, it comes to them bypass their
[46:34] mind dropping their heart as a thought.
[46:36] And when they speak it, it expresses a
[46:38] word.
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:46] Hallelujah.
[46:52] Are you ready for some more?
[46:55] We talking about perfection and some
[46:56] people freeze. But I'm not talking about
[46:59] sinless perfection.
[47:01] Let the word tell you about this thing
[47:04] called perfection.
[47:07] From God's provided way. Now a righteous
[47:10] man, amen, is not a sinless man.
[47:18] For if you notice, he said Elijah was a
[47:21] man subject to like passions as we are.
[47:26] Amen. He had his ups and downs, his
[47:29] different differences. And the scripture
[47:33] of his life proves he had his ups and
[47:35] downs like we do. Hallelujah. But he had
[47:37] times of wondering, his times that his
[47:39] temper got away from him. He had lots of
[47:42] things that went wrong. But he was still
[47:44] a righteous man
[47:46] because he confessed his unworthiness
[47:50] and believed in God. So that is what
[47:54] made him righteous.
[47:55] [Applause]
[48:05] We are righteous through Jesus Christ. I
[48:09] cannot be sanctified within myself. I am
[48:13] sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[48:16] stands in the presence of God in my
[48:18] place.
[48:20] It isn't my holiness. It's his holiness.
[48:24] My holiness won't work at all, but his
[48:27] does because God done accepted him. And
[48:30] in accepting him, he had to accept me
[48:33] because I'm in him.
[48:37] [Applause]
[48:38] And that's what make it real.
[48:42] Then we don't have to depend on
[48:44] ourselves. Now, that doesn't make us to
[48:46] say we can sin, brother. If you sin, you
[48:48] just got away from God. That's all.
[48:50] There's only one thing to do. Confess
[48:52] it. Get right with God. As long as you
[48:55] desire to sin, this desire of sin is
[48:57] still in your heart. Then it's time for
[48:59] you to stay at the altar till that thing
[49:01] is taken out. Now you will sin. You are
[49:04] bound to sin cause you just can't help
[49:06] it. Not willful sin. But he that sins
[49:08] willfully after receive the knowledge of
[49:10] truth, there remain no sacrifice for
[49:12] sin. But every day you're bound to sin.
[49:14] You are bound to be backsliding
[49:16] constantly. So it takes a constant
[49:18] prayer to God. Amen. That's why Paul
[49:21] said, "I die daily daily." Amen. And if
[49:25] Paul had to die daily, how much more am
[49:28] I going to have to stay at dead all the
[49:30] time? If Paul had to die daily to stay
[49:33] right with God, we all have to do that
[49:36] to die out ourselves. And that is
[49:38] getting God's way. Oh, could we give the
[49:41] Lord some praises, people? Hallelujah.
[49:44] And there's only two ways of doing
[49:46] anything. That's the right way and the
[49:48] wrong way. And them ways are your ways
[49:50] and God ways. And you can't be in your
[49:52] way and God way at the same time. You've
[49:54] got to forget your own way to get into
[49:56] God's way. And you got to get out of
[49:58] your own way to get in God's way. As
[50:00] long as you're in your own way, you're
[50:02] out of his way. So forsake your way.
[50:04] Forsake your thoughts. Forsake
[50:06] everything and rely on thus say the
[50:08] Lord. And then you know you're right.
[50:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. Though you can see it.
[50:15] Hallelujah. None of the sensitive will
[50:17] say it's right. Every one of them will
[50:20] say it's wrong. But you know what? It's
[50:22] right because God said so.
[50:25] Amen. So you are rejecting and denying
[50:27] and giving your your senses trouble.
[50:29] Amen. Your sense is balling. You know,
[50:32] but you are saying God
[50:35] said so.
[50:37] God's provided way for humans is to live
[50:40] not by your senses but by his word.
[50:44] Because humans was given these five
[50:46] senses to contact down here. But a
[50:49] different sense was given to contact up
[50:51] there. God put man in his own image. And
[50:54] God is a supernatural being. He was a
[50:56] supernatural man. And none of those five
[50:58] senses declare his heavenly home. So
[51:00] those five senses, the food tasting
[51:02] nice, that does not mean that have
[51:04] nothing to do with your heavenly home.
[51:05] You're touching this, you're feeling
[51:06] this, and your emotions that has nothing
[51:08] to do with your heavenly home. All what
[51:10] you're feeling, experiencing these five
[51:11] senses is for down here.
[51:14] Can we give the Lord some praises? Are
[51:16] you with me? Amen. So these five senses
[51:19] control the human body and two senses
[51:21] control the inside man. Faith and
[51:23] unbelief. You've possessed one or the
[51:25] other. Oh my. I think it's a good thing.
[51:29] In Florida and somebody's desk was three
[51:31] monkeys. One of them had his hand over
[51:33] his eyes see no evil. Other one had his
[51:36] fingers over his ears hear no evil. The
[51:38] other one had it over his mouth speak no
[51:40] evil. I think that's a good thing. You
[51:42] keep your mind pure on Christ. Now you
[51:44] see if you don't watch you will get
[51:46] yourself over into a place and thinking
[51:49] you will you you can't live listen you
[51:52] can't live so perfect till you don't
[51:55] make that mistake now don't you think
[51:57] you'll ever get that way you are not
[52:00] sinless and you are certainly you will
[52:02] certainly get off of the track on this
[52:05] side or that side but a man that once
[52:07] knocked down if he's a real soldier
[52:09] he'll rise up again
[52:11] so don't ever talk about a man knocked
[52:12] down knock Amen. Oh, your knockdown come
[52:16] yet. That's right. Hallelujah. Maybe you
[52:19] still crawling. You start to walk yet.
[52:22] Amen. That's why you a fall yet.
[52:24] Hallelujah. But once you a man on this
[52:26] earth, you don't get knocked down. Amen.
[52:28] Hear what the prophet said. Lord, let me
[52:31] rise and try again. But a coward as soon
[52:34] as he sees you make a little mistake
[52:35] like the bug on the water spider will go
[52:37] right back in water again. So that's why
[52:40] some people they they don't ever get
[52:41] criticism.
[52:43] Because they they does they do nothing.
[52:48] They try nothing. They affect nothing.
[52:51] They stand for nothing. They just like a
[52:53] dish rag. Everybody loves them. They
[52:56] have trouble with no hope. They are very
[52:58] good and nice. If the priest see them,
[53:00] he sh them with holy water. They'll make
[53:03] them an acolyte in the church or
[53:04] whatever it is. Nobody troubles them.
[53:07] Nobody butters them. They butter nobody.
[53:09] They just nicy nicy.
[53:13] But anytime you try to do something,
[53:14] there's always going to be opposition.
[53:16] Always going to be criticism for the
[53:18] kingdom of God. You think the devil just
[53:20] lets back and said, "Oh, go ahead. Uh,
[53:23] God bless you." The devil saying, "God
[53:24] bless you." God already bless you. God
[53:27] pronounce a blessing on the devil. He is
[53:29] there to hinder, upset, amen, frustrate,
[53:33] and so on. Once you understand that,
[53:35] your whole picture begin to change and
[53:37] recognize truly Romans 8:28 apply. And
[53:40] we know, we know, we know. If others
[53:42] don't know, we know that all things, not
[53:44] some things, all things. Do you believe
[53:46] that? You could say amen to that. But do
[53:48] you really believe that? Because when
[53:50] things happen, you don't believe it.
[53:54] Because your behavior demonstrate you
[53:56] don't believe it.
[53:59] Amen. There come things that go on hand.
[54:00] And when you find things going on, you
[54:02] take it back out. And God say, "I told
[54:04] you leaving it. Take it back in because
[54:05] I had to fix. I I can't stand this no
[54:07] more. I can't take this no more. I can't
[54:09] take this no more. And you raise your
[54:12] voice at at at who? Where the voice at?
[54:14] And you raise your voice at God and all.
[54:16] All right. It's up to you. God forcing
[54:18] you. So God said, "Out of my hand now is
[54:20] your hands." And you know how your hands
[54:22] is already you're long enough. You know
[54:24] how your hands is already. Your hand not
[54:25] good. Your hand is trouble all by
[54:28] itself. So God still waiting, waiting
[54:30] for you to bring it back. Oh, you now
[54:31] get the message. Bring it back to my
[54:33] hands. I could take care of it. I could
[54:35] handle it. My hands big enough to deal
[54:37] with it. Oh, glory to God. This is what
[54:39] I want you to do to be dependent upon
[54:42] me. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[54:45] house.
[54:48] Hallelujah.
[54:51] Hallelujah. God
[54:54] looking through the blood. Hallelujah.
[54:56] He doesn't see you no more as a sinner.
[54:58] He sees you redeemed. You're redeemed
[55:02] because he sees you through Christ.
[55:04] Amen. Hallelujah. That's not enough.
[55:07] Amen. And just now you I don't want to
[55:09] rebuke you, but amen means that you are
[55:12] confirming that you believe that word.
[55:15] Hallelujah. When you don't say amen, the
[55:18] devil say aha, I back in you.
[55:22] Amen. It's you confirming the word to be
[55:25] God.
[55:27] You are saying this is my truth and the
[55:31] truth is what sets me free.
[55:35] I will say it again. God sees you
[55:39] through Christ.
[55:42] Don't like 75%.
[55:45] Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[55:49] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[55:51] Hallelujah. I say it again. Just one
[55:53] more time. Hallelujah.
[55:56] This morning, right now, God not seeing
[55:59] you with your glasses, with your extra
[56:03] hair on,
[56:05] with your special hair,
[56:08] with your stockings, with your shoes,
[56:10] with your tie. He's not seeing your
[56:13] color clothes,
[56:18] with your cologne, with your perfume.
[56:20] He's not seeing that.
[56:25] with your brand new shoes.
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:33] Right now, he is seeing you through
[56:35] Christ.
[56:39] Oh, give the Lord a
[56:41] shout. Oh, thank God for the blood this
[56:44] morning.
[56:51] Oh my Uh-huh. Okay.
[56:55] So, God
[56:56] looking through the blood. Amen. He
[56:59] doesn't see you no more as a sinner. All
[57:01] right. He sees you as redeemed.
[57:05] You're redeemed because he is always He
[57:08] always I missed that word. He always
[57:11] sees you through Christ.
[57:13] That's the reason we can be perfect.
[57:17] Not perfect nose, perfect mouth, perfect
[57:20] teeth. You will get perfect wrinkles,
[57:22] perfect ball head, perfect gray hair,
[57:25] and you will go to a perfect grave. So,
[57:27] forget about it. We are not talking
[57:29] about this physical
[57:30] thing, this natural thing. We not
[57:33] talking about that.
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:46] Not perfect in the sense of sinless. All
[57:49] right. All right. We are perfect in the
[57:52] eyes of God when we are in Christ.
[57:56] That's the reason he said be there for
[57:57] perfect as your family is perfect. He
[58:01] doesn't mean walk with a long gong and a
[58:03] beard and do your hand like that. He
[58:05] doesn't mean that.
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:08] It means you are going to be in him.
[58:14] [Applause]
[58:25] When he died at Calvary, yes, he made a
[58:28] way. He gave up his spirit. The Holy
[58:30] Spirit sent it back on the earth for you
[58:32] to live by. That's what Calvary means to
[58:35] us to follow him. Yes, sir. Okay. Now,
[58:38] we have got to accept it. And to accept
[58:41] it is to accept his person in our
[58:43] hearts. Then we are free from sin. The
[58:46] perfect sacrifice made us perfect. For
[58:48] Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even
[58:50] as your father never is perfect." There
[58:52] is no more to be done. But we are made
[58:55] perfect in the presence of God.
[58:59] Now there is where we lose our position.
[59:02] Hallelujah. If we don't watch, we try to
[59:04] look back to what we was. And as long as
[59:08] we look back to what we was, the
[59:10] sacrifice means nothing to us. You know,
[59:12] it come like you're smoker, you're a
[59:14] drinker, you're a real terrible person.
[59:16] And God come in his mercy and love and
[59:18] get saved. I get baptized and you, oh,
[59:19] since you wash my sins away and leave
[59:21] your burden down by the riverside and so
[59:23] on, fall carry them no more. And you're
[59:25] feeling in love with Christ. All the
[59:26] birds, all the birds looking fresh on
[59:28] you. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Everybody
[59:31] is brethren. People hugging you and
[59:33] loving you and whatnot. After a few
[59:35] little trials and what different things
[59:37] you feel is so strong, you start to make
[59:39] your point, start to get arrogant and
[59:40] what not. And afterwards, afterward
[59:42] something happen next, you start to look
[59:43] at yourself and you start to perfect
[59:44] yourself. You start to think for
[59:47] yourself and and carry on with yourself.
[59:49] That's not what God wants. He wants you
[59:51] dependent on him. Surrender to him. Heal
[59:54] it to him. He love you just when you
[59:56] first come to the Lord.
[1:00:00] You don't take a little baby and say,
[1:00:01] "Baby, walk."
[1:00:03] Baby can't
[1:00:06] talk. God ain't taking no Christian
[1:00:08] baby, no small babe in Christ and say
[1:00:11] walk, speak the word. You can't talk.
[1:00:13] You don't even know God say. Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] So as far as God is concerned is bottle
[1:00:18] of milk for you. The sincere milk of the
[1:00:20] word. That's what you need until you
[1:00:22] grow in God that he can handle more
[1:00:25] stuff.
[1:00:27] As you grow is not less stuff, it's
[1:00:29] more.
[1:00:31] Amen. Because he want more from you. We
[1:00:33] are at the end of the age at the end of
[1:00:36] time. He want manifestation from you.
[1:00:40] That mean we have to become the word. We
[1:00:42] have to become like Christ. We have to
[1:00:44] walk like him, talk like him, act like
[1:00:46] him. We have to be perfect like him.
[1:00:50] Not sinless perfection.
[1:00:52] Oh the Lord.
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:00] So watch. Lord. Hallelujah. Can you see
[1:01:04] a church? Amen. I would not try the job.
[1:01:07] There's no need of trying. You're lost
[1:01:09] to begin with. As long as you look to
[1:01:11] what you have done, but don't look to
[1:01:13] what you've done. Look at what Calvary
[1:01:15] did for you. It paid your price. It
[1:01:18] settled the question. Your sins be a
[1:01:21] scarlet. They'll be white as snow, red
[1:01:23] like crimson, white like wool. Then you
[1:01:26] have no sin. You're perfectly sinless.
[1:01:28] No matter what you have done or what you
[1:01:30] do, you're still sinless. As long as you
[1:01:33] have accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:01:35] savior, your sins are forgiven. Anything
[1:01:37] that's forgiven is remitted and forgot
[1:01:39] about.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah.
[1:01:43] What does it do? It gives you after the
[1:01:45] condition, his spirit to follow him and
[1:01:48] do as he did. He was just one man, a
[1:01:51] perfect man. He gave his life. He made
[1:01:54] an example for you that we must do. The
[1:01:56] first thing I want to say is Jesus, here
[1:01:58] we go, never live for himself.
[1:02:01] Aha. So, as we say this, you have to
[1:02:03] examine you. Jesus never lived for
[1:02:06] himself. His life was spent for others.
[1:02:09] Amen. That's perfect eternal life. When
[1:02:12] you say you go to church and you do good
[1:02:16] things, that's fine. But when you live
[1:02:18] your life to yourself, you haven't
[1:02:20] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:02:22] others.
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:30] Husband, love your wife. That is for
[1:02:31] your wife.
[1:02:33] Wife uh obey your husband or respect
[1:02:36] your husband or reverence your husband.
[1:02:37] That is for you the wife. So I will
[1:02:40] salute all those sisters who find
[1:02:42] yourself their spirit in the Bible.
[1:02:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Your husband
[1:02:48] could testify about your subjection,
[1:02:50] about your behavior, on your attitude.
[1:02:52] If God give your husband to correct your
[1:02:54] papers, he have full marks to give you.
[1:02:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Start to get
[1:03:00] light. And if God give the wife the
[1:03:03] paper to correct the husband, he she has
[1:03:04] full marks to give because he's loving
[1:03:06] his wife. He's cares for his wife and so
[1:03:08] on. She, you know, was God not giving
[1:03:10] the husband to correct his own paper.
[1:03:13] People don't do you don't do that. You
[1:03:15] don't give the children the paper and
[1:03:16] say correct correct it. They will all
[1:03:18] put 10 on it. They won't even look at
[1:03:20] it. They will say for
[1:03:21] pass pass.
[1:03:24] Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] Amen. But God will give the wife.
[1:03:29] God will give the husband. I say how how
[1:03:31] do they fear? Well, my goodness, my
[1:03:33] husband, he is such a Abraham. I want to
[1:03:36] be a
[1:03:37] Sarah. Oh, God. Could somebody say amen?
[1:03:40] Hallelujah. He's such an Abraham. I want
[1:03:42] to call him Lord. Oh, you're not hearing
[1:03:44] what I'm saying. Oh, Jesus.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah. I don't want to go there. I
[1:03:53] don't want to go there. You don't want
[1:03:55] when the wife but the husband he who
[1:03:59] he don't want that when God ask your
[1:04:03] husband who she No, you don't want that.
[1:04:06] You want your spirit to be in the
[1:04:08] scriptures because God going to bless
[1:04:10] his word. And once your spirit is in the
[1:04:13] word, I don't care what I'm said. Give
[1:04:15] me a housewife. Give me a farmer. Give
[1:04:17] me a preacher. Any man that will put God
[1:04:20] first. I will show you somebody that
[1:04:22] will be successful despite all what the
[1:04:24] devil come against them.
[1:04:29] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] In other words, God want to make it his
[1:04:34] proof.
[1:04:36] Amen. Jesus is alive. How how we know
[1:04:38] that? You you you vindicating he is
[1:04:40] alive. You are confirming your life
[1:04:44] confirms that he is alive because your
[1:04:47] life is being changed. Oh, do you
[1:04:49] believe that? Do you receive that? Now
[1:04:52] here we go now. So watch his sinless
[1:04:55] nature express God's word. Oh my. He was
[1:05:01] the word. So God expressed himself by
[1:05:04] his sinless nature. Now look, let's go
[1:05:06] deep. Amen. Notice his sinless nature
[1:05:09] expressed what he was. If his sinless
[1:05:13] nature, God express himself through that
[1:05:16] sinless nature, it shows that our nature
[1:05:19] is evil. Amen.
[1:05:22] 10% say, "Amen." Your nature will be
[1:05:24] real good boy.
[1:05:26] Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] His nature was sinless.
[1:05:31] Proving our nature is evil.
[1:05:33] In case you forget, let me remind you
[1:05:37] that we were born in sin
[1:05:39] and sh I know sometime we forget that
[1:05:41] because we we go to church and we are
[1:05:43] Christians. Amen. Amen. Glory. But I
[1:05:46] want to remind you that you was born in
[1:05:48] sin and shaped in iniquity and happened
[1:05:51] to come into the world without your
[1:05:52] mother teaching you speaking lies.
[1:05:56] And that is because of a nature
[1:06:00] issue. Hallelujah. So Christ come to
[1:06:03] address that nature issue that you could
[1:06:06] be transformed and and Peter said by
[1:06:09] these promises we become partakers of
[1:06:13] his divine nature. No you have a natural
[1:06:16] faith a natural virtue a natural
[1:06:18] kindness a natural this and natural that
[1:06:20] that is still you. That's not his
[1:06:23] nature. He have to firebomb that. He has
[1:06:26] to blow that up. So on your patience
[1:06:29] patience you're playing patient. You're
[1:06:30] playing patient and then somebody just
[1:06:32] rock you off your own patience. You say
[1:06:34] you can't stand it no more. You're fed
[1:06:36] up. You can't take it no more. Your
[1:06:38] patience run out. But his patience can
[1:06:41] run out. It's the patience of Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ. Could somebody say amen?
[1:06:47] Oh
[1:06:48] hallelujah. This is making it real.
[1:06:54] His virtue. Amen. His knowledge. Praise
[1:06:57] God. His temperance. Praise God.
[1:06:59] Hallelujah. His charity. Everybody say
[1:07:02] charity suffered long and it's kind
[1:07:05] How long you suffering? You you you
[1:07:08] suffering short and and and and charity
[1:07:12] suffering long. So if you suffering
[1:07:13] short you you start yet
[1:07:18] because charity suffered long
[1:07:21] and it's kind
[1:07:24] affects suffering here. You want to
[1:07:27] fight back? No. And it's kind a classy
[1:07:30] kind of suffering because it's bringing
[1:07:32] out certain things out to you.
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:39] You can't go to the hospital and doctor
[1:07:41] give my sticky doctor.
[1:07:44] Doctor, I want the red one. That that
[1:07:45] thing sweet. That thing in that bottle
[1:07:47] there. I want I do like that black
[1:07:49] looking one. Give me the red one. Why
[1:07:52] doctor say what you come to me for? Take
[1:07:53] whatever you want. Fix yourself.
[1:07:58] It cannot be that. When the doctor put
[1:08:00] all his instrument and say your heart,
[1:08:02] your this, your that, you need this. You
[1:08:03] see a needle long like that. Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] He say I want a short needle. He say
[1:08:07] this come to this long needle one.
[1:08:11] Said Doc. He said turn your eyes.
[1:08:15] If you really want to be cured, you
[1:08:16] really want the help, you have to get
[1:08:18] the long needle. You have to get this
[1:08:20] particular tablet. You have to get this
[1:08:21] operation. You have to get this. You
[1:08:22] have to get that. Will you come to the
[1:08:24] gospel? Dr. Jesus is here this morning.
[1:08:31] And when he use his sword, which is his
[1:08:33] word, he make a clean cut. Don't move.
[1:08:36] Don't do like it's not to you. It's you.
[1:08:37] Say amen. When he cut, you'll be healed
[1:08:40] one time, too. Hallelujah. Cut off the
[1:08:43] excess flesh. Cut out the world. Cut out
[1:08:46] the fear of the world. Cut out all
[1:08:48] unbelief. Put a desire back in your
[1:08:50] heart, in your spirit. We are going to
[1:08:53] have a revival.
[1:09:00] So watch if it all right. So it shows
[1:09:02] when it is evil and no matter how much
[1:09:04] Here we go. No matter how much we try to
[1:09:06] patch it up. Amen. Amen. You could tie
[1:09:09] it up, jack it up, long dress it up,
[1:09:14] mess it up. Wear book, wear tie, wear
[1:09:16] pin my Jesus loves me and all kind of
[1:09:18] thing like that that have nothing to do
[1:09:20] with nature. Not much hypocrites behind
[1:09:22] that. No, it's bad behavior behind that.
[1:09:25] So, we not talking about that. So, be
[1:09:27] real people. God going to change you and
[1:09:30] transform you.
[1:09:33] That's why God love I could see why God
[1:09:35] loved Jacob. He was real. He was really
[1:09:37] out to trick everybody could trick. He
[1:09:40] wasn't making plain with no trick. He
[1:09:42] wasn't part tricks and 10% tricks. 100%.
[1:09:45] Father, brother, mother, sister, anybody
[1:09:48] at all ripping them off.
[1:09:51] Glory. Hallelujah. Praise God. That was
[1:09:55] Jacob. And God said, "Jacob, I love
[1:09:59] because one thing with Jacob, he's
[1:10:00] focused. He want to be the best thief,
[1:10:03] the best con man, the best." He's
[1:10:04] focused. But when he get transformed,
[1:10:06] he's focused too.
[1:10:08] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. When you're
[1:10:11] half-hearted, half dead, half lukewarm,
[1:10:14] no ambition, no desire. That's why
[1:10:16] That's why God just spew you out
[1:10:17] anymore. He can't handle it. Can't He
[1:10:19] want people on fire. Praise God. I see
[1:10:21] people have earring in their ears, their
[1:10:23] nose, their mouth, their head, their lip
[1:10:24] all about. Say, "Look, they can't look
[1:10:26] at them for too long." Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] It's like demons in the flesh. And they
[1:10:30] have to pip out somehow with all the
[1:10:32] tattoos here left, right, and back and
[1:10:34] center. And the Christians, they're
[1:10:36] being shy. Oh, good Lord. Express
[1:10:39] Christ, give a testimony. Let the glory
[1:10:41] of God show in your face.
[1:10:43] Y t on your back. But praise God. Let
[1:10:47] see people see the glow of God upon your
[1:10:49] life that they want to be like you. You
[1:10:51] could be so salty that you're going to
[1:10:53] affect people around you to get thirsty.
[1:10:55] They want to know why you go to church.
[1:10:57] They want to know how what do you
[1:10:59] believe. They want to know why you are
[1:11:00] like that. Why you walk like that? Why
[1:11:03] you dress like that? Why you are so
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:09] different. We are different.
[1:11:16] We are Christians. We're not
[1:11:18] Trinidadians. We're not black people,
[1:11:20] white people, red people, brown people.
[1:11:22] We are Christians. I cannot be in white
[1:11:24] flesh. This is not me. You see, there's
[1:11:26] a house. Come on now.
[1:11:30] You understand that?
[1:11:33] What you see here is a house. A temp.
[1:11:37] Hallelujah. Not even a permanent one.
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:42] Hallelujah.
[1:11:44] So I look at this house. I said this
[1:11:45] house getting old boy
[1:11:48] and I can't paint it
[1:11:54] over. I can't repair the
[1:11:59] roof. I can't make one year gray, one
[1:12:01] year black.
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:04] My God, I'm having myself a time. But
[1:12:07] I'm going to be perfect.
[1:12:09] through Christ in Christ we are going to
[1:12:11] be perfect.
[1:12:16] How many feel revived this morning?
[1:12:19] Glory to God. How many feel that going
[1:12:21] free this morning?
[1:12:24] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] Now, now if God see us that way,
[1:12:31] get his bum coming now. I wonder if we
[1:12:34] could get God glasses
[1:12:36] to see each other.
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:44] 5%.
[1:12:49] So you see how God is be upset about
[1:12:53] self-righteous people
[1:12:57] who really think they're on Moses seat
[1:13:00] and they could judge anybody.
[1:13:02] Hallelujah. How do you think the message
[1:13:04] world will judge a woman at the well?
[1:13:09] is only because the record there how
[1:13:10] Jesus handled that they could talk about
[1:13:14] but let that come back again that
[1:13:16] trouble you know
[1:13:22] I could go on and on in scripture to
[1:13:24] show action attitude behavior life
[1:13:29] that's what I'm saying it's it's good to
[1:13:30] look back in the records of David and
[1:13:33] Samson and different things and so they
[1:13:34] stand up and and and and and and and and
[1:13:36] and and Samson say once more Lord and
[1:13:38] whatn not and whatn not it's good
[1:13:41] because you could read that you could
[1:13:43] rejoice about that but but you could you
[1:13:46] think you're losing your eyes and making
[1:13:47] a jail sentence and coming out to serve
[1:13:49] God and say Lord once more no fiery
[1:13:52] furnace die for the three Hebrew boys
[1:13:55] Hallelujah that is for them
[1:14:00] lion that's your Daniel
[1:14:02] not for you you want to see birds
[1:14:08] But it's fine. Oh, look at those pretty
[1:14:10] birds. Daniel, he he okay with the
[1:14:12] lion's den. Table boys, he they fiery
[1:14:15] furnace.
[1:14:17] You want a free pass. You want God to
[1:14:19] say as you pass pass.
[1:14:23] Don't let Daniel see you. Don't let
[1:14:24] charge of mission see you. Just pass
[1:14:26] behind there.
[1:14:29] Nobody gets a free pass.
[1:14:34] I want a bigger amen than that. No son
[1:14:38] or daughter gets a free pass.
[1:14:41] Every son that cometh to God must must
[1:14:46] must be tested. Must be track must
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:15:00] Amen.
[1:15:02] So watch. So no matter how much we try
[1:15:04] to patch it up, how much we try to I
[1:15:07] like this word indocument it with other
[1:15:09] things. That's a word, but there's the
[1:15:12] prophet word indoc. It's got to become
[1:15:15] sinless like he was.
[1:15:18] Then God's word can flow through it.
[1:15:21] That's a big one. He is saying we got to
[1:15:24] become sinless like he was. Let's go
[1:15:26] down deeper. That don't mean perfection
[1:15:28] in yourself. You can't be that.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:34] Then he said even our people are getting
[1:15:36] from the practice of holiness.
[1:15:40] Holiness have to be practiced.
[1:15:44] It's a choice action for you to sanctify
[1:15:46] yourself. Turn your hair some filthy
[1:15:47] woman. Amen. Go in the right places. And
[1:15:49] so that is something that you have to
[1:15:51] do. Nobody can do that for you. You have
[1:15:54] to do that. You have to overcome. You
[1:15:56] have to fight. You have to get off your
[1:15:57] laziness and say, you know what? Enough
[1:15:59] is enough. Deadness finish.
[1:16:03] Bad attitude finish. Enough is enough.
[1:16:05] My mind have to transform. God transform
[1:16:09] my mind.
[1:16:12] Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] Glory. Amen.
[1:16:19] Sinless nature expressed the word of God
[1:16:21] so much that he and the word was one. He
[1:16:23] said, "I and my father are one. I always
[1:16:26] do that which pleases and my father
[1:16:27] one." He was so perfect in the image of
[1:16:29] God until he and God was expressed the
[1:16:31] same thing. He was the flesh. The son
[1:16:34] expressed the deity of God. So that made
[1:16:36] him deity in man in order to redeem man.
[1:16:39] He and the word was one. Now I am not
[1:16:41] sinless. Brother Abraham speaking. I got
[1:16:45] plenty hanging on me and every hour I
[1:16:48] confess it constantly. Amen. Now that
[1:16:51] has to do with our with relationship
[1:16:53] with God. This is not church now because
[1:16:57] you come to church once every Sunday and
[1:16:59] if you look sharp once every two Sundays
[1:17:01] or once every three Sundays and sometime
[1:17:03] you don't come Thursdays and you don't
[1:17:05] even call the fact what happen if the
[1:17:06] pillar of fire come down and divide
[1:17:07] itself and you miss your portion or your
[1:17:09] portion is on its way or the pillar of
[1:17:11] fire stays to tell you that you have to
[1:17:13] come back the next Thursday in the
[1:17:14] prayer meeting to get your fire and get
[1:17:15] your portion you don't even trust it you
[1:17:17] just don't come and you know what I mean
[1:17:19] is okay because you have to you know
[1:17:21] what I mean but the thing of it is come
[1:17:23] on Hallelujah. You have to have a
[1:17:26] relationship with Christ.
[1:17:29] Notice we ain't talking about doctrine.
[1:17:32] Cuz today people talk about doctrine.
[1:17:33] You got to believe this. You don't
[1:17:34] believe this. You're out of it. You
[1:17:36] believe this and you believe this. But
[1:17:37] do you believe Christ? Receive Christ as
[1:17:40] a relationship.
[1:17:43] My my my.
[1:17:45] Now when I see my wrong, then I turn
[1:17:47] from that and I try to do what's right.
[1:17:51] I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my
[1:17:53] marriage. I wouldn't get there. I am
[1:17:55] trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:17:58] He's my trust. That's what I want you to
[1:18:01] trust. The merits of him. And you know
[1:18:04] you are getting there is when here we
[1:18:06] go. When every word you punctuate it
[1:18:09] with an amen
[1:18:11] 10%. Amen. So you know something some of
[1:18:14] them not not there yet because we know
[1:18:17] you're there when you could punctuate
[1:18:19] every word. When the word hit you, you
[1:18:22] amen. It cut you, you amen. It slice
[1:18:25] you, you b amen. It hit you hard, you
[1:18:27] still say amen. Because it's the word.
[1:18:34] I ain't talking about clap. Clap is
[1:18:36] fine. We want you to clap too. We
[1:18:37] talking about your mouth saying
[1:18:40] the four be said amen. That's right. The
[1:18:43] four be said amen. 24 elders they said
[1:18:45] amen and hallelujah and glory. The one
[1:18:47] say clapping the lamb take the book. He
[1:18:49] is worthy. Oh yes. worthy lamb. And
[1:18:50] again, baby
[1:18:53] clap, finger clap. No, no, no. Them
[1:18:56] fellas cast out the crown and had us
[1:18:57] jump and shout and praise God because we
[1:19:00] know we shall reign on the earth. Oh,
[1:19:03] hallelujah. Those those guys saw it and
[1:19:05] they broke into the spirit realm. That's
[1:19:07] what you got to do. You had to loose
[1:19:10] yourself in the spirit of
[1:19:13] God. I ain't coming to get fight with no
[1:19:15] congregation. No, I stop that long time.
[1:19:18] I come to jam them demons right off of
[1:19:20] you. When I come here, I come with a
[1:19:22] sword. Glory to God. I don't back down.
[1:19:25] You know, you could stare me hard. You
[1:19:27] could I would get your mouth open. We
[1:19:30] will drop bombs upon your life. Yeah.
[1:19:33] Bomb after bomb after bomb. Glory to
[1:19:36] God. You would wake up. Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] Hallelujah. That's what we're here for.
[1:19:41] To cast devils out.
[1:19:48] Oh hallelujah.
[1:19:50] Glory hallelujah. So watch because the
[1:19:53] word itself is trying to vindicate
[1:19:54] itself. And if we deny the word, how can
[1:19:56] it be vindicated? So when you don't say
[1:19:58] amen, God even show you believe what
[1:19:59] you're hearing. Oh, amen means so be it.
[1:20:02] So when you say amen, the heaven record,
[1:20:04] they say amen. They say amen.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. Praise God. When you walk
[1:20:08] out the church, the devil say, you know,
[1:20:09] they say amen for all of that. Let me
[1:20:11] walk for if they really believe them.
[1:20:12] Amens.
[1:20:16] Oh my. I'm I'm enjoying myself. We going
[1:20:19] to give the devil a run for his money.
[1:20:21] Oh yes. We going to have smoke in his
[1:20:23] face. Oh yeah. When we leave here, we
[1:20:25] have to leave here with power, man. We
[1:20:27] can't leave here dry dry. You don't want
[1:20:29] to leave here. Can I go on here? I go on
[1:20:31] rapture. I go on. What? What? What is
[1:20:33] that? What is that? After all the hell
[1:20:35] the devil give us all these years, we
[1:20:37] must give back some thunders. We have
[1:20:39] seven of them to deal with. Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:20:44] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. This bride
[1:20:46] is not going to be easy. This bride
[1:20:48] going to be missing Jesus Christ.
[1:20:54] Oh, hallelujah. We have some things to
[1:20:57] handle. Yes, we have some work to
[1:20:59] finish. Jesus didn't finish his work on
[1:21:01] the earth. He leaves some work for the
[1:21:03] bride to do. We have some devils to
[1:21:05] handle. We have some gates to possess.
[1:21:08] God told Abraham and th seed shall
[1:21:12] possess the gates of the enemy. Jesus
[1:21:15] walk into death and possess it. The
[1:21:17] bride shall not see death. The grim
[1:21:19] reaper have to battle. You have to turn
[1:21:22] back. You have to run. Hallelujah.
[1:21:25] Because the bride is going to be
[1:21:26] changed. There is going to be a people
[1:21:29] transformed, transfigured, raptured off
[1:21:32] the earth. Oh, glory to God. And as we
[1:21:36] near the headstone, we're going to be a
[1:21:38] super race. We're going to be a super
[1:21:40] church. God set.
[1:21:47] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:21:50] Oh, those devils getting off of you
[1:21:51] right now. That's why you have to praise
[1:21:54] God. Oh,
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:22:00] hallelujah. Oh, you may be
[1:22:02] seated. What trials, what trials you
[1:22:04] have been through that you can't worship
[1:22:07] and praise God this morning. What's so
[1:22:09] hard? What's so bad? You're not in Iraq.

[1:22:29] in your hand. You have no bad luck on
[1:22:31] your
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:35] mouth. Jesus said, "Who the son of man
[1:22:39] set free?" Oh, could you give the Lord a
[1:22:42] shout in the
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:54] house? See, I don't care how sick I am.
[1:22:57] I will let the devil know whose side I'm
[1:22:58] on. Hallelujah. Praise God. Let the
[1:23:01] devil know who side you're on. You on
[1:23:03] the shouting side. You on the praising
[1:23:06] God's side. You are the pull along a

[1:26:35] bring the man here or you wreck them off
[1:26:37] here. Get them out."
[1:26:41] [Applause]

[1:26:50] how we operate. Amen. Every situation is
[1:26:52] a mind of God. Every condition there's a

[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:17] You you forget who we dealing with. You
[1:31:20] know, it's not just a record. You open
[1:31:22] the Red Sea. It's a sea, you know. It's
[1:31:25] not a ravine. It's not It's not like a
[1:31:27] trickling like a some little bay and
[1:31:30] little river. It's the sea, you know.
[1:31:35] Hallelujah. 2 million people back
[1:31:38] against the sea. All right. Pharaoh
[1:31:40] behind them. Mountains on both sides and
[1:31:43] God is still God.
[1:31:46] A way maker, but it look like no way.
[1:31:49] Somebody try to cut you off here.
[1:31:51] Somebody's promot somebody in the job
[1:31:53] ahead of you here. Something happened
[1:31:55] here. Some neighbor playing some big
[1:31:57] loud music down the street down there
[1:31:59] and God just said, "What you want? You
[1:32:02] want to move the
[1:32:04] man? You want to sell the
[1:32:09] house? You want the owner? Get somebody
[1:32:11] else to
[1:32:12] rent that will not play that kind of
[1:32:15] music. Come on now. Come on now. Ask
[1:32:18] what you will. You want a promotion? You
[1:32:21] want to raise a pay? You want to improve
[1:32:24] your life? Come on now. Come on
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:29] now. Oh.
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:41] What do you want? Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:46] Hallelujah. What do you want?
[1:32:50] What do you want this morning?
[1:32:52] What do you want this morning?
[1:32:55] Hallelujah.
[1:32:58] What you want this morning? You You got
[1:33:00] to speak it. You You got to ask it. What
[1:33:04] do you want this morning? Do you want
[1:33:06] deliverance? Do you want that evil
[1:33:08] spirit to come out of your life? Do you
[1:33:11] want to be free from the devils that
[1:33:12] tormenting you all these years? Do you
[1:33:15] want it finished with, over with? Done
[1:33:19] with? Oh, glory to God. Somebody give
[1:33:24] the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:39] Jesus.
[1:33:42] Hallelujah. He was the word in full. The
[1:33:46] word of God flow through him so freely
[1:33:49] that he could speak the word it will
[1:33:50] create. Amen. That's how powerful it was
[1:33:55] through Jesus. And he knew it. When at
[1:33:58] that Lazarus day he said, "Father, I
[1:33:59] pray I know you always hear me. but for
[1:34:02] those around. And so he knew he knew the
[1:34:06] power of his words. When the Lazarus is
[1:34:08] dead and he said he sleepeth, I go wake
[1:34:11] him. He he knew he knew the power of of
[1:34:14] the words in his mouth. It was so
[1:34:16] powerful. One day he sit back and heaven
[1:34:19] will heaven and earth would pass away
[1:34:21] but my words will never pass. That
[1:34:23] that's the power that was in his mouth.
[1:34:26] Amen. And that coming to sons of God in
[1:34:29] the last days. Amen. So how would God
[1:34:32] entrust men with such power if they have
[1:34:35] no character?
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:40] So a man don't like me. You know what
[1:34:41] they will do? Speak me out of existence.
[1:34:48] They say I ain't like to you over it.
[1:34:50] Disappear.
[1:34:53] It's only that right now when they speak
[1:34:54] them things, it just their words just
[1:34:57] disappearing
[1:34:59] cuz just human. God not even bothered
[1:35:01] with that. God not even honoring that.
[1:35:04] So I could see the burden of God all
[1:35:06] these years was to get his word in his
[1:35:10] people because he really want to entrust
[1:35:13] you with power. And but Stephen brought
[1:35:15] a tremendous exhortation on Sunday.
[1:35:16] receive on Thursday night that God's
[1:35:19] pleasure is to see you adopted.
[1:35:23] It's the good pleasure of his will.
[1:35:29] God is getting excited.
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:36] Did you get that? God himself is getting
[1:35:40] excited because the pleasure, his
[1:35:42] pleasure is being fulfilled.
[1:35:46] When you see sons coming into maturity,
[1:35:50] sons coming in character, sons with a
[1:35:52] burden of the word, with the burden of
[1:35:55] God. I always do that which pleases my
[1:35:58] father.
[1:36:02] Some I was preaching, how could you
[1:36:04] please God if you don't know his will?
[1:36:06] If you don't go into his word, how will
[1:36:08] you know his will? You need to get the
[1:36:10] word to know his will because his word
[1:36:12] reveals his will and that is how you
[1:36:14] please him. You can say pleasing God,
[1:36:16] Lord. That's the whole thing with with
[1:36:18] with with um Abel and Kane and Abel. God
[1:36:21] say offer something and and and and Abel
[1:36:23] just bring flowers and say, "Well, take
[1:36:24] that.
[1:36:26] I I feel led to drop that on you."
[1:36:29] Flowers, fruits, and what? Can do that.
[1:36:32] Abel, take a lamb. It not looks so
[1:36:34] pretty. Take a rock, slash the throat,
[1:36:36] blood come out and God rejoice over
[1:36:38] that. He say Abel offer a better
[1:36:41] sacrifice than Cain and K. So God reject
[1:36:45] King offering King get rot. God said
[1:36:48] listen G. Listen G you don't even need a
[1:36:50] revelation. Just do what you brother do
[1:36:53] and you get the same blessing he get.
[1:36:55] You don't even need a revelation. He did
[1:36:57] it. I confirm it and bless it if you do
[1:37:00] what he do. He shout, you shout. He
[1:37:02] prays, he prays. He pray you pray. He
[1:37:04] press you press. Come on
[1:37:07] now. Come on now. Help me somebody. You
[1:37:11] hearing all of this and
[1:37:13] you God don't want your keep
[1:37:18] your keep your M. Keep it. God don't
[1:37:22] need it. He want to hear your
[1:37:24] mouth. Shout
[1:37:28] out. I beg you to shout.
[1:37:32] Shout and the wall is going to come
[1:37:35] tumbling down.
[1:37:50] Hallelujah. Glory. What did prophet say
[1:37:53] about adoption? He want to say there is
[1:37:57] my spirit flowing freely not doctrine
[1:38:02] being taught teacherally
[1:38:10] like brother John said a powerful thing
[1:38:12] in Cameroon he said before you could
[1:38:15] speak the truth in love you have to have
[1:38:17] a love of the truth
[1:38:21] I just love that I must love that before
[1:38:25] you could speak the truth in love. You
[1:38:27] see, many men speak lovely the truth.
[1:38:31] But you have to have a love for truth, a
[1:38:34] love for what is right, a love for what
[1:38:36] is principle,
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:41] glory,
[1:38:43] we are different. Amen. You know that,
[1:38:46] right?
[1:38:48] Amen. So he was perfect in harmony with
[1:38:51] him and the word was so perfectly until
[1:38:53] he created whatever he done. He and the
[1:38:55] word become one. He the bridegroom took
[1:38:59] away your shame. Amen. And put it in the
[1:39:02] sea of forgetfulness. Amen. By the
[1:39:04] washing of the water of the word of God.
[1:39:07] Hallelujah. Listen. So now we understand
[1:39:10] is not sinless perfection. Now we
[1:39:13] understand righteousness doesn't mean no
[1:39:16] sin in that sense because the confession
[1:39:18] is through the blood through Christ. Now
[1:39:21] you're going to get this quote. Let me
[1:39:23] see what he going to do for you. This is
[1:39:24] from Invisible June and the bride. He
[1:39:26] said you are standing completely
[1:39:29] justified as though you never did it at
[1:39:31] the beginning. Amen. This is my message
[1:39:34] to the church. He said if you are
[1:39:36] standing on God's word with God's word
[1:39:39] amen every turtle. Well, I'm telling
[1:39:41] you, pull away from the shocks. Get out
[1:39:44] there in the wheat where you can write
[1:39:46] before the sun. I hear the coming of the
[1:39:48] combine. You are standing complete
[1:39:51] justified, not forgiven. There's a
[1:39:53] bigger word than forgiven. Justified
[1:39:56] means you never did it.
[1:40:01] So when Satan bring up his his his
[1:40:04] confirmation sheet and the evidence of
[1:40:06] all what he recorded you doing at his
[1:40:07] tape recorder cuz he videotaping and
[1:40:10] he's the accus of the brethren and he
[1:40:11] come to play it back. Go say where,
[1:40:15] when, how, who, and God say, "Well,
[1:40:19] Christ died at Calvary, shed his blood,
[1:40:22] paid a price." All of a sudden, Satan's
[1:40:25] screen
[1:40:26] goes. He said, "Where as he called about
[1:40:29] the blood on the cross, Satan know what
[1:40:32] happened? He can't see it. He can't see
[1:40:34] your sins. He can't see where you fall.
[1:40:37] Can't see where you're failing. He can't
[1:40:39] see anything. Go go go go go take all
[1:40:41] your sins
[1:40:42] and drop
[1:40:51] it sees it. Drop it in the sea of
[1:40:53] forgetfulness. Listen, he had drop it
[1:40:55] that it floating, you know, because it
[1:40:57] float and Satan could pick it up. So he
[1:40:59] had to drop it with some kind of rocks.
[1:41:01] Maybe the rock is Christ and he just
[1:41:02] drop it, drop it, drop your sins down in
[1:41:06] in the sea of forgetfulness. Satan can't
[1:41:08] find that. Therefore, you could free to
[1:41:10] wave your hand. You free to say amen.
[1:41:13] Glory, hallelujah. You free to worship.
[1:41:17] You free to smile. Some of you smiled
[1:41:19] good for a long time. Baby smile, baby
[1:41:21] smile. No, you're free to
[1:41:23] laugh. Hallelujah. Because you are free.
[1:41:27] You're free to have
[1:41:31] joy. You may be seasoned. Your joy is
[1:41:34] not in your husband. Your joy is not in
[1:41:37] your wife. Your joy is not in your
[1:41:38] children. Your joy is not in your money
[1:41:40] or your pay packet or your job or your
[1:41:42] house or your land or your car. That's
[1:41:44] not your joy. Christ is your joy. Christ
[1:41:47] becomes your rock. He's your fortress.
[1:41:50] He's your deliverer. He's your strong
[1:41:52] and mighty tower. In him will I put my
[1:41:56] trust. Oh, some trusted army and
[1:41:58] horsemen, but I trust in the Lord.
[1:42:08] Glory.
[1:42:10] Talk about thanksgiving. You are the
[1:42:12] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:42:14] of the living God. Every man that's born
[1:42:17] of the spirit of God, watching, blood of
[1:42:18] Jesus Christ, believes the word, stand
[1:42:20] as though you never sin at the first
[1:42:23] place. You are perfect. You are standing
[1:42:27] completely like you never sin in the
[1:42:28] first place. God don't even know it's in
[1:42:31] the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:42:34] Not even God could remember it.
[1:42:37] Amen.
[1:42:39] You are the virtuous bride of Christ
[1:42:41] washing the blood of Christ. Precious
[1:42:42] virtuous sinlessness. You see God
[1:42:44] telling me that. God telling you that.
[1:42:46] Amen. This is why say the bride, she is
[1:42:49] the one that is the called to
[1:42:51] perfection.
[1:42:53] Some people call to for church. They
[1:42:56] love church bad. You can't get church
[1:42:58] out the system.
[1:43:01] Tell them the word. that's not important
[1:43:02] to them. They love church. They like the
[1:43:04] singing. They like the pastor. They like
[1:43:07] the the believers. They like they like
[1:43:09] how the thing go and whatnot. Some
[1:43:12] people like the old time way, the old
[1:43:13] time way, the old time songs. As I said,
[1:43:16] all the juice squeeze out of those
[1:43:17] songs. They sing it so long, so much. It
[1:43:20] have no more juice in it. You can't get
[1:43:21] virtue from the songs no
[1:43:24] more. When they bring a new song, they
[1:43:26] get
[1:43:27] fight. But the old song is like old
[1:43:29] tradition. on the old
[1:43:36] time and you know the devil is staying
[1:43:39] old time you see that's the whole point
[1:43:41] the devil not saying old
[1:43:43] time I test lutter
[1:43:46] so I had to get him a lutheran test
[1:43:48] devil not in that you know devil know
[1:43:50] all what he loose and lut for lut you
[1:43:52] know cuz I was horse and buggy
[1:43:58] when this internet age where the don't
[1:44:00] even know what is they have a book just
[1:44:01] now. They they wouldn't even know the
[1:44:03] spin page. They only doing the tablet.
[1:44:04] So
[1:44:08] true.
[1:44:10] Like they born and they only seen a
[1:44:11] tablet in front of them. So the pressing
[1:44:15] like the age in that present age
[1:44:20] and you want to have the old time prayer
[1:44:22] Lord you know how it is
[1:44:27] pressure. And when God started to hear
[1:44:29] you pray that God has been here, God
[1:44:31] feeling shame
[1:44:33] for a son in this last day to be talking
[1:44:36] that kind of talk.
[1:44:40] It's almost embarrassing when you
[1:44:42] supposed to be coming with a revelation
[1:44:43] of the blood. when you should be coming
[1:44:45] with a direction of authority. When the
[1:44:48] child comes sick in your house or your
[1:44:50] neighbor sent for you and you could go
[1:44:53] and say by the authority vested in me as
[1:44:56] a son of God in Jesus name, get out
[1:44:59] Satan.
[1:45:09] [Applause]
[1:45:13] God must be able to find you anywhere
[1:45:17] and you are ready to utter a prayer unto
[1:45:20] good.
[1:45:23] That's the life I'm talking about.
[1:45:25] That's the life worthy of the gospel of
[1:45:28] Jesus
[1:45:31] Christ. Not when they call you I I can't
[1:45:34] come now, you know.
[1:45:35] Um because I I feeling good in my heart.
[1:45:41] So what you going to church for? Who
[1:45:43] supposed to feel good? The
[1:45:45] piper drug addict might marijuana. You
[1:45:49] you coming to church, you supposed to
[1:45:51] have a hard
[1:45:52] thing like people God supposed to be
[1:45:55] sending people to you. Listen, God sent
[1:45:57] an aposome for the prophet to pray.
[1:45:58] Animal and all coming to the prophet.
[1:46:01] Look, I read some on the internet today
[1:46:03] some a elephant. A elephant was shot.
[1:46:06] Nobody know the elephant shot. And the
[1:46:08] elephant went up a hill by a whole bunch
[1:46:10] of people to get help. They said
[1:46:12] normally an elephant would stay down on
[1:46:14] the plane and whatnot. And the man know
[1:46:15] something was wrong. They sent for a
[1:46:16] doctor. It become when they check out
[1:46:18] the elephant was shot and whatnot.
[1:46:19] Elephant train treat him or whatn not.
[1:46:21] Elephant they say the intelligent
[1:46:23] animal.
[1:46:24] Amen.
[1:46:26] Elephant get shot and say you know what
[1:46:28] I going strong.
[1:46:32] I ain't call the pastor.
[1:46:35] I ain't calling no elder.
[1:46:38] I pray God for myself
[1:46:41] afterwards. Boop.
[1:46:43] Elephant dead.
[1:46:46] That's what we here for. You're sick,
[1:46:48] call the elders. You're in trouble, call
[1:46:50] somebody. Don't just sit there and die.
[1:46:54] Do something.
[1:47:00] But I don't want to disturb you. So why
[1:47:02] you calling me for?
[1:47:05] This what I'm here for? to be disturbed.
[1:47:08] As long as I am not disturbed like a
[1:47:10] disturbed mind or a disturbed man, but
[1:47:13] I'm here to be disturbed. I'm here to
[1:47:16] take up a responsibility. That is why
[1:47:18] you identify yourself to belong to this
[1:47:20] church. You ask to be a member of this
[1:47:22] church. You pay your tithes, your
[1:47:23] offering in this church, then I'm
[1:47:24] responsible. Then you have issues, you
[1:47:26] have challenges. That is where you get a
[1:47:28] phone call, you call, you want to see
[1:47:29] the pastor, you want to talk, you want
[1:47:31] to relate, you want help, and sometimes
[1:47:33] a word comes. Many time people come in
[1:47:34] the office and they get a direct word
[1:47:36] from the Lord and not even thinking but
[1:47:38] because God sees your need. He has to
[1:47:40] use a vessel. He has to use an office.
[1:47:42] He has to use a position. That's what it
[1:47:43] is about. So when you sit down in your
[1:47:46] human spirit thinking I want to do this,
[1:47:48] I want to do this. How it going to look?
[1:47:50] How you going to look?
[1:47:52] How you going to look when you
[1:47:55] look like a pretty corpse? Amen. Don't
[1:47:58] just sit there and die and live.
[1:48:01] God want you alive. You can't praise him
[1:48:04] in the grave. Come on now.
[1:48:09] Listen. Somebody could be 92, 95, 95, 96
[1:48:12] years old. You don't hear him say
[1:48:14] looking at the dead boy. Where'd he go
[1:48:15] from?
[1:48:17] They're looking to see the next birthday
[1:48:18] with cake and candles to blow out.
[1:48:25] Some of you want to look more dead than
[1:48:26] them.
[1:48:28] That's why I can't handle the dead young
[1:48:30] people and even dead old people and all.
[1:48:34] We not supposed to be We not supposed to
[1:48:36] be addressing dead. We not supposed to
[1:48:38] be preaching to the dead. The dead is
[1:48:40] here to be raised up. Nobody should
[1:48:43] leave your dead. If you're dead, you're
[1:48:45] supposed to be resurrect by the time
[1:48:46] your service is
[1:48:48] over. If you're backslanting, you want
[1:48:50] to be restored. If you're a sinner, you
[1:48:52] want to be
[1:48:53] saved, but you're here to enjoy the
[1:48:56] Lord. Oh, glory to God. Enjoy his
[1:48:59] covering and blessing. You are covered
[1:49:01] this morning, you know, by blood. But I
[1:49:04] know some of you don't understand that
[1:49:06] yet.
[1:49:10] But the devil's job is to make sure you
[1:49:12] don't get understanding.
[1:49:14] Amen. Amen. To be blindsided
[1:49:17] where you don't have full information
[1:49:19] that you could be sidetracked and
[1:49:22] knocked off the position that you're in.
[1:49:23] Hallelujah. If the devil could get you
[1:49:25] to believe your sword is a butter knife,
[1:49:27] then they wouldn't use it as a sword.
[1:49:29] You see that long thing you have there
[1:49:30] that could do a good butter. Look the
[1:49:32] badger in here. Look the blue bar here.
[1:49:34] Dip it and p your bread with that. If
[1:49:37] you listen to that devil, you will take
[1:49:38] a sword and find yourself sticking the
[1:49:40] knife. So, and buttering your bread
[1:49:41] quite here.
[1:49:43] Use a butter knife for that. But when
[1:49:45] you understand the word is a sword. And
[1:49:48] when you pick it in the hand, the hand
[1:49:50] of faith is what going to conquer that
[1:49:52] devil and recognize you are sons and
[1:49:55] daughters of living God. You're not
[1:49:56] children. You're not babies. Praise God.
[1:49:59] You're not idiots. Come on now. You're
[1:50:01] not just dumb dumb people. Glory to God.
[1:50:04] God bless you with sense and
[1:50:05] understanding. God called you into this
[1:50:07] message that you could be shaped, that
[1:50:09] you could be formed, that you could be
[1:50:11] honed, that you could be cut, that you
[1:50:13] could represent him on the earth. You're
[1:50:16] not a church boy. You're a son of
[1:50:19] God. You're a good man. Come on, give
[1:50:22] the Lord a shout. You're not ashamed of
[1:50:25] the gospel. You are happy to be in the
[1:50:28] gospel. I am not ashamed of the son of
[1:50:31] man, nor his words. Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:35] What a blessed message that we have
[1:50:36] received from that Malachi 4 Elijah
[1:50:40] prophet. Oh
[1:50:41] hallelujah. Thank God for that prophet.
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:49] Oh hallelujah. Oh glory to God. As as as
[1:50:53] that dragon anointed descends on
[1:50:55] America. Hallelujah. That land anointed
[1:50:58] but descend upon the bride. Oh
[1:51:01] hallelujah.
[1:51:02] Praise God. I'm going to try to wrap up
[1:51:05] here at the home stretch. St. John
[1:51:09] 16 12 Jesus speaks. I have many things
[1:51:14] to say unto you, but you cannot bear
[1:51:18] them now. Amen. Amen. I like that. In
[1:51:22] other words, I wouldn't waste my time
[1:51:24] talking stuff to you now that you can't
[1:51:27] handle.
[1:51:29] How be it when he he the spirit of truth
[1:51:33] is come he will guide you into all truth
[1:51:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:51:43] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:51:45] speak and he will show you things to
[1:51:48] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:51:51] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:51:54] you all things that the father hath are
[1:51:57] mine Therefore said I that he shall take
[1:51:59] of mine and shall show it unto you. 1
[1:52:03] Corinthians
[1:52:04] 2:6 to 8. How be speak wisdom among them
[1:52:08] that are perfect. Amen. Yet not the
[1:52:10] wisdom of this world, nor the princes of
[1:52:12] this world that come to know it, but we
[1:52:14] speak wisdom of God in a mystery, even
[1:52:17] the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[1:52:20] before the world unto our glory, which
[1:52:22] none of the princes of this world knew.
[1:52:24] For had they known it, they would not
[1:52:25] have crucified the Lord of glory if they
[1:52:27] knew it. Amen. If they knew it, they
[1:52:30] wouldn't crucify the effect of the word
[1:52:32] upon the people. Amen. Because we
[1:52:34] supposed to be looking for a seventh and
[1:52:36] bright revival. Amen. If they knew it,
[1:52:38] they wouldn't crucify the effect of the
[1:52:39] seven seal upon the people. If they knew
[1:52:40] it, they wouldn't crucify this message
[1:52:42] the way they have. Amen. And reduce it
[1:52:44] to denominational denomination where you
[1:52:46] just have the books and the tapes and
[1:52:47] the prophet and man just say a few
[1:52:49] things. Couldn't have done that. Listen
[1:52:52] to what the saying margin
[1:52:55] divorce. Know that the seals are open.
[1:52:59] Amen. Amen. The spirit of truth directs
[1:53:03] us to the word. Yes, sir. Oh, give the
[1:53:06] Lord a praise. Did you hear that? Okay.
[1:53:09] Ride with me for the home stretch. Now,
[1:53:11] now that the seas are open, all right,
[1:53:13] what the spirit of truth cuz remember
[1:53:16] the same angels come from eternity to
[1:53:18] gather the scattered word to tie it back
[1:53:20] into the word to bring down the holy
[1:53:22] ghost. Amen. So the holy ghost is who
[1:53:23] opened the seals which was the spirit of
[1:53:25] truth released to all the earth. So he
[1:53:28] is saying now that the seals are open
[1:53:30] the spirit of truth directs us to the
[1:53:32] word that explain all the mistakes made
[1:53:34] down through the ages.
[1:53:38] God never did have any time a group of
[1:53:41] men to run his church. It always been
[1:53:44] the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Holy Spirit
[1:53:46] that's the teacher. When the spirit of
[1:53:48] truth has come, he will guide you into
[1:53:51] all truth. Amen. The Holy Ghost alone is
[1:53:54] the divine revealer of the divine
[1:53:57] revelation of Christ. Hallelujah. The
[1:54:00] Holy Ghost alone. So therefore it
[1:54:02] disconnects this top man, teacher man,
[1:54:05] best man, more educated man, more
[1:54:08] learned man or more revelated man. Amen.
[1:54:12] We know that's not a word but that is
[1:54:13] what he has talked about. He is more
[1:54:15] revelated. He have more revelation.
[1:54:17] Amen.
[1:54:20] So he's the man of the hour.
[1:54:23] Yet the Bible talk about doctrines of
[1:54:25] devils. Devils bringing doctrines to
[1:54:28] teach. No more talking. No more life to
[1:54:30] manifest. You believe this. You You
[1:54:31] don't believe. You're out of it. Who you
[1:54:33] believe? Where you believe? Where you
[1:54:34] believe?
[1:54:36] As if the death angel when they come,
[1:54:38] they say, "We believe. We believe. We
[1:54:39] believe." Oh, you don't believe that?
[1:54:41] Boom. That angel say, "Who?" Come, come.
[1:54:44] We believe. We believe. No. All was
[1:54:48] commissioned is when I see the blood
[1:54:50] pass over. Amen. So all of them were
[1:54:52] teaching and they doctrine and they the
[1:54:55] vets
[1:54:56] because they vets because we're not
[1:54:59] riding with their doctrine and teaching.
[1:55:00] It's foolishness.
[1:55:03] In London, England tell them when
[1:55:05] imagine when the beast had to ride and
[1:55:07] and and and they tighten up and whatnot.
[1:55:10] Somebody come with some coach go a
[1:55:12] prefer in last
[1:55:13] days the beast will lick them up. Amen.
[1:55:16] You you can't go with beast system after
[1:55:19] 50 plus years I talk about go look look
[1:55:21] a book read it I told them in London you
[1:55:24] have to become the book by then
[1:55:27] it's beast power you know is a forcing
[1:55:30] you know understand this it wasn't easy
[1:55:33] for those three boys to say we will not
[1:55:35] bow down we still praying they took a
[1:55:39] stand they were working with the
[1:55:40] government and they took a stand and
[1:55:41] they take the penalty of it fiery
[1:55:43] furnace they don't care you can be the
[1:55:45] best worker the best. This when pressure
[1:55:47] come, pressure come, laws come, laws
[1:55:49] come. America being wrapped up with
[1:55:51] laws. They creating the laws that they
[1:55:53] could shut down the churches. They're
[1:55:55] creating the laws fixing up homosexuals,
[1:55:57] fixing up transgender, fixing up
[1:55:59] everybody else. It's an agenda, loosed
[1:56:02] by the devil to ensure the Christians
[1:56:05] are squeezed out according to prophecy
[1:56:08] that no man buy or sell unless they take
[1:56:10] the mark of the beast. So they sit here
[1:56:12] and watch on me. Something is moving,
[1:56:14] something is turning. But when that bit
[1:56:16] is perfect, it's come. You have a higher
[1:56:22] calling.
[1:56:24] Hallelujah. It's easy to join the
[1:56:26] church. You could leave this one and
[1:56:28] join that one and join that one. That's
[1:56:30] easy. But to answer the call to
[1:56:33] perfection, that's different.
[1:56:37] Regardless of that's mean you're going
[1:56:38] to get your life shake up. What said
[1:56:41] this way, it means a lot of shaking down
[1:56:43] for me. It means a lot of shaking up for
[1:56:45] you. But together we're going to make it
[1:56:47] by the grace of God.
[1:56:51] Perfection means shake up.
[1:56:54] Hallelujah. You cannot continue as you
[1:56:56] are. Oh my. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:57:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. But say,
[1:57:04] heavenly father, we are grateful to you
[1:57:05] to know we are living in the last days
[1:57:07] just before the coming of just one. that
[1:57:10] wonderful, glorious, loving son of
[1:57:11] yours, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
[1:57:13] who we love. And we know the Bible
[1:57:16] speaks of an appearing before the
[1:57:18] coming.
[1:57:20] Amen. Listen good. Listen good. Did you
[1:57:23] hear that? The Bible speaks of the
[1:57:25] appearing
[1:57:26] before the coming. And there's a
[1:57:29] difference in the word appearing and
[1:57:31] then coming. Now father we realize that
[1:57:34] the church has come through the stage of
[1:57:36] justification. Come through the stage of
[1:57:38] sanctification. Come through the stage
[1:57:39] of receiving the Holy Spirit. Now the
[1:57:41] stones are being honed for the fitting
[1:57:44] of the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:47] Wonderful. Amen. So God have to cut men
[1:57:50] to fit that.
[1:57:53] Come on. God had cutting the ministry to
[1:57:55] fit the man. God cutting the man to fit
[1:57:58] the ministry. Amen.
[1:58:01] And every man I cut it good enough, he
[1:58:03] can fit.
[1:58:06] Amen. Because he had to be fitted in.
[1:58:09] Oh, give the Lord some praise this
[1:58:10] people.
[1:58:13] Now remember, appearing and coming is
[1:58:16] two different words. To appear and then
[1:58:18] to come. Now is the appearing.
[1:58:22] He already appeared in these last days
[1:58:23] right here with us in the last few
[1:58:25] years. Now it's a sign of his coming.
[1:58:28] He's appearing in his church. So we
[1:58:30] could talk till we blew in the face. We
[1:58:32] have to see Jesus appear among us.
[1:58:35] Then we could talk about Christ coming.
[1:58:38] He has to appear. So all these years
[1:58:41] ministry of the word, books and tapes
[1:58:43] and wounds and and whatnot. But now it
[1:58:45] has to turn
[1:58:48] into the spirit of God. And you have to
[1:58:50] create the atmosphere. You have to want
[1:58:52] it in your house. You have to want this
[1:58:54] fire in your house. You have to want the
[1:58:56] anointing in your house. Praise God. Not
[1:58:59] Hollywood, the anointing, the dove, the
[1:59:02] pillar of fire, the Holy Ghost. You have
[1:59:04] to want that at your supper table, at
[1:59:07] your dinner table, in the bedroom, in
[1:59:09] the drawing room, in the kitchen, behind
[1:59:11] the house, all around. You want to be
[1:59:13] walking with God.
[1:59:17] Don't shake your head. Say, "Amen."
[1:59:25] Amen.
[1:59:26] Now, Christ is appearing in these last
[1:59:28] days in his church. Here we go. Bringing
[1:59:31] here the purpose of the appearing.
[1:59:33] Bringing his church together in unity.
[1:59:35] Amen. Seven gather together. Yes. And
[1:59:38] faith. Unity and faith and power in the
[1:59:41] word all together. So when he returns,
[1:59:43] he will find the same church. Amen. Oh,
[1:59:46] hallelujah. We see the evening lights.
[1:59:49] The Holy Spirit coming in so strong upon
[1:59:52] his church. Oh, you mean the Holy Spirit
[1:59:56] has to come so strong. Yes. Are you
[1:59:58] looking for it? Are you expecting? I
[2:00:00] couldn't believe the singing I heard
[2:00:02] this morning. Like everybody was
[2:00:04] singing. Everybody was in the spirit.
[2:00:06] That felt so good. When you're like
[2:00:09] that, anybody out the spirit that's
[2:00:10] getting in the spirit, too, because your
[2:00:12] spirit has be just just like that. Just
[2:00:14] sweeping. It's sweeping. That was
[2:00:16] rocking this morning, man. Every any
[2:00:18] minister would like to come in that
[2:00:19] anointing. That was glorious. Now watch
[2:00:22] the anointing coming so strong. The Holy
[2:00:25] Spirit upon the church till the ministry
[2:00:27] of Jesus Christ is noing amongst the
[2:00:30] people. They set there with faith. Here
[2:00:32] we go. Bringing him down power and gifts
[2:00:37] working among them. Wait a minute. Say
[2:00:40] that again. They sat there with faith
[2:00:42] bringing him down. Now you saw deep
[2:00:46] calling him deep but ra on the platform
[2:00:48] here and people was pulling the pillar
[2:00:50] of fire off the platform pulling him
[2:00:52] down. That means your faith could pull
[2:00:54] him down. Nobody could stop you. You
[2:00:57] have the remote.
[2:00:58] [Applause]
[2:01:01] You didn't hear what I'm saying? You
[2:01:03] have the remote to press and pull the
[2:01:05] pillar of fire. Something went wrong.
[2:01:07] Something went right. Pillar of fire.
[2:01:08] Move off the platform. That man across
[2:01:10] there, he's sick with so and so and so.
[2:01:12] You are healed. Jesus Christ same
[2:01:13] yesterday and forever. Come on to the
[2:01:15] bathroom. Wait a minute. That person
[2:01:16] there with cancer, that person with
[2:01:17] leukemia, that person with this, that
[2:01:19] person with that. What is happening?
[2:01:20] They have the
[2:01:22] remote. Faith is the remote. You hear
[2:01:25] what I'm saying? Press the button.
[2:01:36] Hallelujah. One time a woman feeling led
[2:01:38] to pray for a baby next to her. Woman
[2:01:39] had a child was sick. And then think
[2:01:43] baby come pray line something like that
[2:01:44] and bra said the woman uh she said woman
[2:01:47] the woman prayed for her because God
[2:01:50] know that woman have more compassion
[2:01:52] than him. The baby is healed. Watch is
[2:01:54] not around healing the people. It's the
[2:01:57] Holy Spirit. God put a burden on a woman
[2:01:59] to pray for that child. And God used
[2:02:02] that burden to
[2:02:04] channel. You see the word is a conductor
[2:02:07] of the spirit. God have to have a talent
[2:02:10] to ride on. Right through. God want your
[2:02:13] mouth. God want your eyes. God want your
[2:02:15] ears. God want your clothes. God want
[2:02:17] you. You. You. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:02:22] praises. God want to use you.
[2:02:26] I'm not hearing you. God really want to
[2:02:30] use you.
[2:02:33] Amen.
[2:02:38] You see the the true revelation two type
[2:02:41] three woman Sarah,
[2:02:45] Hagga and Mary. Yes, three women. Isn't
[2:02:49] that right? Amen. Mary brought the
[2:02:51] virgin birth to produce Jesus Christ.
[2:02:53] Three denominational ages carriers which
[2:02:56] must die and dry up just like the shock
[2:02:59] and so forth have to give room for the
[2:03:01] seed. The seed cannot get ripe until the
[2:03:04] shock stalk leaves all dry. It saps the
[2:03:08] very life of it out of them. So that is
[2:03:11] why after a while the anointing begin to
[2:03:13] dry up everywhere because the bride
[2:03:15] start to absorb the anointing
[2:03:18] cuz the bride becomes the word the
[2:03:21] seed. That is why you're so word
[2:03:23] connected,
[2:03:25] scripture connected, Bible connected,
[2:03:28] because the Pentecostals ah they
[2:03:30] couldn't come to perfection with the
[2:03:32] gifts. No, they rejected the prophet who
[2:03:34] brought the word. So the Pentecostal
[2:03:36] couldn't go into maturity. So God lead
[2:03:38] them there with their gifts and they
[2:03:39] have big churches, mill empires and God
[2:03:42] lead them there with that. Amen. So God
[2:03:44] decided to call us a bunch of people, a
[2:03:46] bunch of people that going to be pride.
[2:03:49] He call it bite material that he want to
[2:03:52] cut out from. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] So God come like God rolled out a b and
[2:03:59] said this is the material I'm going to
[2:04:01] use. I can't use Lutherans. I can't use
[2:04:03] Wesleyians. I can't use Pentecostals and
[2:04:06] bring out a word message to roll out
[2:04:08] this boat the court and out of a group
[2:04:11] of the true se of the world out of this
[2:04:13] court. I'm going to cut out a bride. A
[2:04:16] pyramid bride, a virtuous bride, a seven
[2:04:19] thunder bride, an elected bride, a
[2:04:22] predestinated bride. I'm going to roll
[2:04:24] out this message court.
[2:04:28] [Applause]
[2:04:31] Hallelujah.
[2:04:33] Let them hear the shout. But I'm going
[2:04:36] to bring another call, a call to
[2:04:39] perfection. Oh, glory to God. And the
[2:04:42] bride going to answer that call. Oh,
[2:04:45] give the Lord a praise for
[2:04:50] it. Will you be perfect?
[2:04:54] [Applause]
[2:05:00] That's a big challenge.
[2:05:05] You may be seated. It takes you past
[2:05:07] pleasing your husband, pleasing your
[2:05:08] wife. Hallelujah. Takes you to pleasing
[2:05:10] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Really, really
[2:05:13] pleasing the Lord. Amen. Takes it past
[2:05:16] church. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] Watch what Ram says here. Now it's sea
[2:05:22] time.
[2:05:23] Bright time. Amen. The shocks are dead.
[2:05:26] The shocks are dried up. Virgin word
[2:05:29] time. Hallelujah. Not touched. Virgin.
[2:05:33] Watch. If it's manhandled, it won't be a
[2:05:36] virgin. If you put the hands of the
[2:05:38] nomination on it, it won't be a virgin.
[2:05:40] He said, "Hallelujah. How wonderful.
[2:05:42] There will be no denominational
[2:05:45] manhandling in the virgin birth of the
[2:05:48] bride."
[2:05:50] Oh, those guys are finished.
[2:05:53] They are finished. They're going to
[2:05:55] handle the church, but not the bride.
[2:05:58] The bride going to answer the call to
[2:06:01] perfection.
[2:06:02] Oh, hallelujah. Only Jesus going to make
[2:06:05] that call.
[2:06:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:13] Oh, glory to God.
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:19] Now watch. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:22] Praise God. Glory to God. My God. My
[2:06:25] God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:06:28] Job. Hallelujah. He said, "Though the
[2:06:31] skin won't destroy my body, yet in my
[2:06:33] flesh, I shall see. God is not right."
[2:06:36] Isn't that right? So he found out that
[2:06:38] there was one coming who would bring
[2:06:40] back perfection to the word of God
[2:06:42] again. He said I know my redeemer liveth
[2:06:44] and yet in my flesh I will see God. He
[2:06:47] seen the perfect one coming. Job being a
[2:06:49] prophet. The secrets of God is known to
[2:06:51] the prophets. He spoke the word and when
[2:06:53] he spoke the word it become material for
[2:06:56] it was a spoken word of God and in its
[2:06:58] season happened just like that. Now when
[2:07:00] he spoke the word the word was a seed
[2:07:03] and it matured in its season. So when
[2:07:05] God spoke for us that was had a season

[2:08:07] You may be seated.
[2:08:09] Yes. Is it all right to pray for your
[2:08:11] child? The child who want prayers when
[2:08:13] they up, pray for them when they
[2:08:14] sleeping.
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:19] If you don't want your lay hands upon
[2:08:20] them when they up and running around
[2:08:21] when they sleeping, put your hand upon
[2:08:23] them. Satan, this is not yours.
[2:08:28] Not this one here. Claim them. That's
[2:08:31] your right. That's your redemptive
[2:08:33] right. The Bible said we are no longer
[2:08:35] strangers but citizens of the household
[2:08:38] of God. Citizens have
[2:08:42] rights. I have a right to joy. I have a
[2:08:45] right to revival. I have a right to
[2:08:46] healing. I have a right to breakthrough.
[2:08:48] I'm a citizen. I am not a stranger.
[2:08:59] My God. My God.
[2:09:05] All the illegal people have to be
[2:09:06] ducking and hiding.
[2:09:09] Every time I see a uniform immigration
[2:09:10] officer, they getting frightened.
[2:09:12] Hallelujah. Driving a car, I drive easy,
[2:09:15] easy, easy. They feeling guilty. Oh my
[2:09:18] God. Amen. Because they know they don't
[2:09:20] really belong. Amen. The papers
[2:09:22] organized yet for them. Yes. But when
[2:09:25] you are citizen
[2:09:27] sometime instead of call the prime
[2:09:29] minister prime minister call by first
[2:09:30] name
[2:09:33] you think a non-citizen could do
[2:09:35] that wrong with
[2:09:38] he we what are you doing?
[2:09:44] Why? Because it's your country.
[2:09:49] Hallelujah. Big old pothole in the road.
[2:09:52] They burnt tires. Fix the road. Amen.
[2:09:55] Block the road up. You can't do that if
[2:09:57] you're not a citizen. Try that. You get
[2:10:01] arrested and deported.
[2:10:03] Only citizen could behave like that.
[2:10:08] We have a right to protest against
[2:10:10] unbelief. We have a right to protest
[2:10:12] against sickness, to protest against
[2:10:14] evil. We raising up the blackard this
[2:10:16] morning. No more sickness. We are going
[2:10:20] to be free. You are going to be
[2:10:30] healed. Oh,
[2:10:37] hallelujah. Glory. Glory.
[2:10:42] Glory. My Jesus. You may be seated. Oh,
[2:10:45] hallelujah.
[2:10:47] Hallelujah. My God. When they come to
[2:10:50] church, come to root for Jesus. Come to
[2:10:52] back up Jesus. Come to see Jesus score a
[2:10:54] goal. Come to see Jesus get victory. You
[2:10:57] come all a glory. Bring your waving hat.
[2:11:00] Bring your shouting shoes. Bring your
[2:11:02] hands. Bring your worship. Come on.
[2:11:05] Bring something for
[2:11:06] [Applause]
[2:11:08] [Music]
[2:11:11] God.
[2:11:13] Hallelujah. Glory to
[2:11:15] God. My God. We have come here for a
[2:11:19] funeral service. We come here to prepare
[2:11:21] for the wedding supper. The world
[2:11:22] preparing for a funeral service. The
[2:11:24] world going downhill. We preparing for
[2:11:26] wedding supper. Glory to God. You may be
[2:11:29] seated. But preach here. He said when
[2:11:31] they go up in the astronaut, they have
[2:11:33] to rehearse down here. They have to go
[2:11:35] in a tube with a weightlessness and
[2:11:37] float and walk. Yes. They get trained to
[2:11:40] that because up there they don't have
[2:11:41] gravity and so on. So when the when you
[2:11:44] have your milk or bottle or juice it
[2:11:45] flying away from you floating in the
[2:11:47] air. So if you never test that and
[2:11:50] experience that when you go up in space
[2:11:51] and you see your food
[2:11:53] flying say Lord have mercy I will
[2:11:57] starve but they train them on earth in
[2:12:00] that weightless environment. So when the
[2:12:02] food falling around you have to know how
[2:12:04] to put your hand how to drink or when
[2:12:07] the water pelt out to flow in slow
[2:12:09] motion. You have to know all of that.
[2:12:11] When you get that skill, then you're
[2:12:12] ready to go up. So therefore, you must
[2:12:15] have some seal down here before you go
[2:12:16] up.
[2:12:18] You must cast out some devils. You must
[2:12:20] heal some sick. You must raise some
[2:12:23] dead. You must ah come on now. Come on
[2:12:25] now. You must handle a bear. You must
[2:12:28] deal with a lion. Then it is a Goliath.
[2:12:32] I'm coming for your head.
[2:12:43] My my my
[2:12:48] [Applause]
[2:12:54] after a while. We said it before some
[2:12:57] time ago when when they have all the
[2:12:59] different men trying to be president of
[2:13:00] America. No bother with them. When they
[2:13:02] come out to the few, they start to get
[2:13:04] protection now. Amen. FBI protection,
[2:13:06] CIA, whatever they have the security
[2:13:08] protection. Then they get official
[2:13:09] protection. The people don't control
[2:13:11] that. You know, the government controls
[2:13:12] that. They protect that candidate
[2:13:14] because that may be the future president
[2:13:15] of America. What about you? You're God's
[2:13:18] chosen candidate.
[2:13:21] God already elected you.
[2:13:25] Nobody can vote for you. Come on now.
[2:13:28] This is before the foundation. You You
[2:13:31] should be shouting. Listen, before
[2:13:32] before the foundation of the world, God
[2:13:35] already elect you. So he's sending out
[2:13:38] angelic
[2:13:39] [Applause]
[2:13:45] escort. Oh
[2:13:48] hallelujah. The footsteps of the
[2:13:51] righteous are
[2:13:53] ordered.
[2:13:55] Ordered.
[2:13:57] Ordered. Ordered.
[2:13:59] The footstep of the
[2:14:01] righteous are ordered by the
[2:14:08] Lord. Woo!
[2:14:10] Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] Hallelujah. He will not let you fall.
[2:14:15] The Lord will keep thee. Oh, he that
[2:14:19] keep a day will not stumble or sleep.
[2:14:28] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[2:14:34] Okay, let's go a little further now.
[2:14:36] Whoa. Now watch. Unveiling of God. After
[2:14:41] the stalk has been formed, after
[2:14:44] after the test has been formed. All
[2:14:45] right. After the grain has come unto the
[2:14:48] cup, then it has to come to perfection.
[2:14:52] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:14:55] So you cannot talk perfection until you
[2:14:58] see grain.
[2:15:00] [Applause]
[2:15:02] Perfection can't be preachers talk.
[2:15:04] Perfection can't be preached to the the
[2:15:06] hub. It has to be the grain. Once it
[2:15:09] come out to grain, you're going to be
[2:15:11] perfect.
[2:15:12] Oh hallelujah.
[2:15:14] Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. Brother
[2:15:17] Brham unveiling of God. Now when did he
[2:15:19] reveal himself? In a different form.
[2:15:21] stalk, tassel, all leaves. He revealed
[2:15:24] himself. Same spirit, different form.
[2:15:27] But the last of that corn, it comes back
[2:15:30] to the original grain. It has to come
[2:15:33] back to the original. Loud and age.
[2:15:36] Notice this false vine come into full
[2:15:39] fruition in this age. Her fruit would
[2:15:41] mature and ripen. That is correct. This
[2:15:45] evil spirited church full of iniquity
[2:15:48] will be revealed as the mustard seed
[2:15:50] that grew into a tree wearing lodge the
[2:15:52] fowls of the air. At her head will be
[2:15:54] antichrist. The mystery of iniquity. All
[2:15:58] this is true. Amen. And if this is true
[2:16:01] then it must also be true that the bride
[2:16:04] church will mature
[2:16:07] and her rightness shall be an
[2:16:10] identification with her Lord by means of
[2:16:13] the word.
[2:16:15] and her head who is the mystery of
[2:16:17] godliness. Amen. Which is Christ.
[2:16:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:22] This false church with all cunning and
[2:16:25] diabolical power
[2:16:27] made up of political force. All right.
[2:16:31] Physical force and demons of darkness.
[2:16:35] That's the trinity that combines that
[2:16:36] false church. Political, physical, and
[2:16:41] demonic.
[2:16:42] the true vine with the fullness of the
[2:16:45] spirit and the word will do the very
[2:16:49] acts and power that Jesus did. Amen. In
[2:16:53] England, I preach about one body, one
[2:16:56] spirit and one head.
[2:16:58] There's only one body. That Jesus is
[2:17:01] head of. That's the body called the
[2:17:02] church. That's not a physical body.
[2:17:05] That's an international bride body. And
[2:17:07] by one spirit, you are baptized into
[2:17:09] that one body. And when you get into
[2:17:11] that body, nobody could pull you out. So
[2:17:13] the key is to go into the body. Once
[2:17:16] you're in the body, they could send you
[2:17:17] in Australia, New Zealand, they could
[2:17:19] send you to England, China, they can
[2:17:21] send you anywhere. You'll still be a
[2:17:22] Christian.
[2:17:26] You will be a Christian in any church,
[2:17:28] in any group, in any country, you will
[2:17:31] still be a Christian.
[2:17:32] [Applause]
[2:17:36] Oh my. Listen, we survived in a long
[2:17:38] time. Yes, our testimony and history on
[2:17:41] believers, they survived a long time.
[2:17:42] Abraham survived, his people, his
[2:17:44] family. Jacob survived. Joseph survived.
[2:17:47] Come on. The history is already there.
[2:17:48] They don't care where they put us. In
[2:17:50] Egypt, we're going to survive. In
[2:17:51] Babylon, we're going to survive. Oh,
[2:17:53] they can't out the light. The light just
[2:17:55] continues on. As they try to cut us out,
[2:17:57] we pass the torch to somebody else.
[2:18:00] Hallelujah. Paul passes Irene and Martin
[2:18:02] and Columb, Luther and Wesley, all them
[2:18:03] keep passing one to another. Hallelujah.
[2:18:05] And Wesley pass it to William Brand
[2:18:07] Pentecostal.
[2:18:10] [Applause]
[2:18:13] Pentec down to the resurrection. You
[2:18:16] hear what I'm saying?
[2:18:19] Why? Why? Why you running? Because it
[2:18:20] take perfection to bring resurrection.
[2:18:24] No perfection. No resurrection. There
[2:18:26] got to be a people that call to that
[2:18:29] perfection. Oh, glory to God. In order
[2:18:31] to bring the resurrection, oh, that
[2:18:34] people is here tonight. I believe that's
[2:18:36] you. You are part of that. Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] Hallelujah. So here it is. The true vine
[2:18:42] with the fullness of the spirit and the
[2:18:45] word will do the very acts and power
[2:18:47] that Jesus did. Hallelujah. Then as she
[2:18:50] nears her headstone becoming like him
[2:18:53] through the word. Amen. Jesus will come
[2:18:56] that the bride and groom may be united
[2:18:58] together as one.
[2:19:00] Yet it is harvest time. Amen. Then there
[2:19:03] must come forth a scene in this age.
[2:19:05] those who will bring the wheat and tears
[2:19:06] to maturity. The
[2:19:08] tears are already maturing very fast
[2:19:12] under corrupt teachers who turned the
[2:19:15] people from the word. But the wheat must
[2:19:18] also mature and to her God is sending
[2:19:21] the prophet messenger with the
[2:19:23] vindicated ministry that he might be
[2:19:26] accepted by the elect. They the elect
[2:19:30] will hear him as the first church heard
[2:19:32] Paul. Amen. and she will mature in the
[2:19:35] word. Amen. Here we go. Until becoming a
[2:19:40] word bride. Amen.
[2:19:44] The mighty works will be found in her
[2:19:46] that are always attendant upon pure word
[2:19:49] and faith. Amen. Your written epistles
[2:19:51] read of all men. Translate that. Turn it
[2:19:54] around. You are epistles that have been
[2:19:57] written. You can't add nothing to it.
[2:19:59] That's read of all men. Manifested word
[2:20:02] of God. In other words, Peter and John,
[2:20:05] Jesus, was manifesting himself through
[2:20:09] them. Amen. Christ veiled in their
[2:20:13] flesh, manifested, made alive like he
[2:20:16] was in Moses. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:20:19] Hallelujah. So the seed is the word and
[2:20:21] the God and the and every age have its
[2:20:24] seed in its time and the people that of
[2:20:27] that age that manifest that promised
[2:20:29] word is the seed of that age according
[2:20:32] to what Jesus said. They are the
[2:20:34] children of the kingdom. The
[2:20:37] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[2:20:40] operating through his children is those
[2:20:43] seed of the kingdom of that age. Notice
[2:20:45] he never talk about doctrine. Right.
[2:20:47] Amen. The doctrine, the chanting
[2:20:49] teaching is the manifestation. You see
[2:20:52] the mystery, the preaching. No, he
[2:20:54] didn't say that. Come on. Hallelujah.
[2:20:57] The manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[2:20:58] operating through his children is those
[2:21:00] seed. He said now we become tabernacles
[2:21:02] of that Holy Spirit which is Christ.
[2:21:05] That's the real seed. Then if the real
[2:21:07] Holy Spirit, here we go, gets into the
[2:21:10] real seed, it won't take part of it
[2:21:12] because the devil uses that. You've got
[2:21:14] to take all of it. Oh. Or wait a minute,
[2:21:16] brother O. You mean the devil take part
[2:21:18] of the message? Of course.
[2:21:21] God take hold.
[2:21:24] The word becomes alive in our own flesh
[2:21:27] and that shows the presence of God.
[2:21:29] Amen. So as the word becomes flesh, you
[2:21:31] get more presence.
[2:21:33] Present. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Did you
[2:21:37] hear that? As the word becomes flesh,
[2:21:41] you get into more presence. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:44] the word coming into your flesh. Then
[2:21:46] you are walking with the presence of
[2:21:48] God. And you have to become aware the
[2:21:51] presence is with you. Amen.
[2:21:55] Then you become aware, I'll never leave
[2:21:56] you. I'll never forsake you. Hallelujah.
[2:21:58] In trying circumstance, you have to know
[2:22:00] God is there. You have to strain your
[2:22:02] head and scratch your head and pull out
[2:22:03] your hair and bite your nails. God is
[2:22:05] there. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] So when a man lives by faith and walks
[2:22:12] by faith, I mean substance faith, he's
[2:22:15] incisated from the entire world, become
[2:22:17] a new creature in Christ. There now you
[2:22:19] are getting into bright material. You're
[2:22:22] getting into rapturing condition. That
[2:22:24] means for each one of us, not just the
[2:22:26] pastor, the deacon or the trustees. It
[2:22:28] means the lady, every individual walks
[2:22:31] in a world with God alone.
[2:22:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Every individual
[2:22:37] what?
[2:22:39] Walks with God alone. If your family not
[2:22:40] walking with God, you walking with God.
[2:22:42] If your good friend not walking with
[2:22:43] God, you walking with God. If your
[2:22:45] brother, mother, husband, wife,
[2:22:47] children, whatever, not walking with
[2:22:48] God, but you walking with God. You're
[2:22:50] responsible to walk with God.
[2:22:53] Not friend first, God first. Hallelujah.
[2:22:58] Hallelujah. No, you're coming to perfect
[2:23:00] faith. Perfect for perfection that
[2:23:02] cannot fail. That faith never fails. He
[2:23:05] was a mistake. Mystic to the world. Oh
[2:23:08] my.
[2:23:10] Oh hallelujah. Could we take a little
[2:23:11] more? Just a little more. Are we going
[2:23:13] good?
[2:23:19] You enjoying the Lord this morning.
[2:23:21] How many How many thank God you're a
[2:23:23] Christian?
[2:23:24] [Applause]
[2:23:35] Now remember, there won't be any
[2:23:37] denomination.
[2:23:39] Watch. Okay. The shocks pulling away.
[2:23:42] Hallelujah. No cooperation, nothing with
[2:23:44] it. Always pulls away. There can be no
[2:23:47] more. It's wheat now. And we are plenty
[2:23:50] green. Brother Brana. Listen to his
[2:23:52] description. We are plenty green. We
[2:23:55] have to lay in the presence of the sun
[2:23:59] to be mellowed up. Uhhuh. So he's
[2:24:03] talking about coming into presence and
[2:24:05] staying there to get mellow. Plenty
[2:24:08] green. We haven't got and he calling
[2:24:09] pentigree. Now he's interpreting it. We
[2:24:12] haven't got the
[2:24:13] sincerity, the sacredness, the thing we
[2:24:17] ought to have in our midst. Amen. So
[2:24:20] coming out of greenness is to coming
[2:24:21] into sincerity. Amen. Coming into
[2:24:24] sacredness, coming into respects like I
[2:24:27] always wanted the church that I serve to
[2:24:29] be one noted by brotherly love and
[2:24:31] respects because I know people going to
[2:24:34] be judged by blaspheming what the spirit
[2:24:37] of God begin to do. And I was always
[2:24:39] scared and concerned by people saying
[2:24:42] the wrong thing. That's why B say
[2:24:44] something nice, say something good, say
[2:24:46] something loyal, say something truthful.
[2:24:49] Don't just loose your tongue and say
[2:24:50] anything. you would pay for that. But
[2:24:54] say the right thing and train yourself
[2:24:56] to speak the right thing because one of
[2:24:59] these days you might just end up saying
[2:25:00] the wrong thing at the wrong time and
[2:25:02] God will judge you right there on the
[2:25:04] spot for that. You don't want that.
[2:25:06] Amen. Be humble. Be gracious. Be
[2:25:10] grateful. Hallelu. Don't be arrogant and
[2:25:12] puffed up. God looking for somebody. The
[2:25:14] more he blessed, the more humble
[2:25:15] becomes. He said usually when people get
[2:25:17] blessed, they get puffed up. They get
[2:25:19] arrogant. Two little blessing and they
[2:25:21] like like like like like like like like
[2:25:22] like like like like they drowning in
[2:25:23] blessings. Hallelujah.
[2:25:28] Amen. A full air of corn. A full wheat
[2:25:31] boughs. Amen. A empty head stick up.
[2:25:33] Stick up. Stick up. Stick up. This is
[2:25:35] how I always know it. I always used to
[2:25:38] do it. But I'm telling you not that way.
[2:25:42] But pastor, you know the Lord show me. I
[2:25:44] am telling you the Lord show you nothing
[2:25:47] is all puffed up in your mind. It's a
[2:25:49] religious spirit upon your life that you
[2:25:51] need to repent of. Because if I am the
[2:25:53] pastor telling you, you're supposed to
[2:25:55] listen to the pastor because he is God's
[2:25:57] mouthpiece servant speaking the word to
[2:25:59] you. Now, if the pastor is a cuckoo man,
[2:26:02] that's different. But if the pastor is
[2:26:04] on the word, that's something else.
[2:26:09] You can hardly find a man on the word
[2:26:11] that preaching pure word. They're
[2:26:13] preaching themselves, the ministry, the
[2:26:15] position, the organic life.
[2:26:17] Amen.
[2:26:20] One brother go to after preach about sub
[2:26:22] local church trouble trouble trouble.
[2:26:24] Church is getting real trouble. All them
[2:26:26] bishops and popes they have down there.
[2:26:28] They don't want that. They want to take
[2:26:30] over.
[2:26:32] They feel is a natural kingdom. You know
[2:26:35] why? Why want to rule some other church?
[2:26:38] What why are you trying to rule some
[2:26:39] other country? That is crazy. China have
[2:26:42] enough trouble all by itself right
[2:26:43] there. Amen.
[2:26:45] At the end of the day, I have to answer
[2:26:47] for you. I have to answer for what I
[2:26:49] have done. That's why I say I accept
[2:26:51] responsibility. It's not you failed. I
[2:26:53] have failed because I supposed to
[2:26:54] produce leadership by the Holy Ghost
[2:26:56] that will inspire you to press on.
[2:26:59] That's what supposed to be here.
[2:27:03] I I come to this morning and tell you,
[2:27:05] could it be? What if it is?
[2:27:09] But what if it's not?
[2:27:12] Could it be this? Could it be that?
[2:27:14] Could it be this? And you your head
[2:27:16] going so could it be? Could it be? Could
[2:27:18] it be? Could it be? And we don't even
[2:27:19] know what what what what's going to be.
[2:27:22] So I'm not here to preach. Could it be?
[2:27:24] I'm here to tell you, thus sayeth the
[2:27:25] Lord.
[2:27:28] Thus say the Lord is the word.
[2:27:32] I told his brothers in Africa, I don't
[2:27:33] study Saturn and Mars and Moon and and I
[2:27:36] don't even bother with that. No explain
[2:27:38] star falling this happening and whatnot.
[2:27:41] I am not an astrologer. I'm not looking
[2:27:42] up there at all. I have seven stars to
[2:27:44] deal with in the right hand of almighty
[2:27:46] God that bring the word for us to the
[2:27:48] rapture for me to wonder if Mars are a
[2:27:51] sign this line up this lineup. So could
[2:27:54] it be so? Could it be so? I I don't
[2:27:55] know. My faith can handle it. I want to
[2:27:58] know thus say the Lord that I'm going to
[2:28:01] have a revival. I want to know dust say
[2:28:03] the Lord. The anointing here breaking
[2:28:05] bonds and wickedness and people leaving
[2:28:06] here transformed those lepers. They say
[2:28:10] Lord have mercy upon us. They are
[2:28:11] lepers.
[2:28:13] You don't hug them up and say come
[2:28:15] precious leper. You stay far from those
[2:28:18] folks that high contagious disease.
[2:28:21] Jesus and all a touch them.
[2:28:24] He said go and show yourself to the
[2:28:27] priest. Amen. Amen. This guy just
[2:28:29] walking. They just walking going down to
[2:28:30] the priest. Obedience. That's they said
[2:28:32] all just a little word just just a
[2:28:35] little word to obey and they walking
[2:28:37] down. All of a sudden they recognize
[2:28:38] they healed. They didn't reach they
[2:28:39] didn't reach the priest. The obedience
[2:28:42] brought healing. Let me say it again.
[2:28:44] Obedience brought healing. Obedience
[2:28:48] will bring healing to your life, your
[2:28:50] home, your marriage, your situation.
[2:28:52] Obedience going to bring it.
[2:28:55] Warn him. Come back and worship Jesus.
[2:28:57] He say where the rest. He know all heal.
[2:29:00] Amen. Where the rest? He said your faith
[2:29:02] has made you whole. Amen. So you see
[2:29:04] what happened? The rest get blessing of
[2:29:07] healing by obedience. This one confirmed
[2:29:10] something more than what they had
[2:29:11] because this one come back to
[2:29:17] worship. Come up please.
[2:29:19] [Applause]
[2:29:22] And I believe the church is beginning to
[2:29:24] hear the message, begin to understand
[2:29:27] it. But friend, we've got to lay in the
[2:29:29] presence of the sun. We've got to be
[2:29:31] ripened. Our faith isn't right.
[2:29:33] Intellectually we hearing the message
[2:29:35] that God give us. Seeing the signs
[2:29:36] proven it by the Bible. Hallelujah.
[2:29:40] Hallelujah. Listen to this
[2:29:43] prophecy. Now listen from God being
[2:29:45] misunderstood. Listen to brother
[2:29:46] speaking and he's speaking it. I want to
[2:29:48] speak it into your spirit, into your
[2:29:50] heart, into your mind.
[2:29:52] Now, as your father in the
[2:29:55] gospel and as your
[2:29:57] pastor, I would like a little later on
[2:30:01] when your spirits and gifts begin to
[2:30:05] come to perfection,
[2:30:09] did you hear that? He's prophesying.
[2:30:13] It will come to perfection.
[2:30:15] If you go to watching them flying loose
[2:30:17] and getting just watch that person, let
[2:30:21] it go cuz it's not the spirit of God on
[2:30:24] them. When they are sweet and meek and
[2:30:29] humble and ready and everything, that's
[2:30:32] the spirit of God. If somebody gets out
[2:30:35] of order and the pastor has to call it
[2:30:37] down and that spirit flies up, it is not
[2:30:40] the spirit of God. The spirit of God
[2:30:43] don't fly up. Amen. The spirit of God
[2:30:46] always stands and comes to the word.
[2:30:48] Amen. Every time what is he saying? The
[2:30:51] gifts order will come to perfection and
[2:30:54] any rebuke, correction, instruction, the
[2:30:56] person will humble themselves through
[2:30:58] the word and they wouldn't keep their
[2:31:00] self and the way they think and what
[2:31:01] they feel and they're feeling led. What
[2:31:03] time we get deal with that feeling led
[2:31:05] and it's not no letter no lord you know
[2:31:07] it's a letter of the head
[2:31:16] margin divorce there is no more shock
[2:31:20] after the shock is gone it's seed God is
[2:31:23] ready are we ready if he isn't doing it
[2:31:27] now he's going to call a church to
[2:31:30] perfection by his word Jesus Christ.
[2:31:34] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:31:37] If he is not doing it now, he's going to
[2:31:39] do it. Do what? Call a church to
[2:31:42] perfection by his word, Jesus Christ.
[2:31:46] So, William Brand message was designed
[2:31:48] to call a bride to perfection. Amen.
[2:31:50] Isn't that right? The prophet word was
[2:31:52] to call us back to perfection. Oh,
[2:31:55] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:31:56] Hallelujah. Do you believe that? Oh,
[2:31:59] praise the name of the Lord. Oh,
[2:32:01] hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:32:04] Thank you, Jesus. Oh my. I think I'll
[2:32:07] just push on here. Now, this great last
[2:32:09] great step. Okay, he's talking about uh
[2:32:12] three elements that constitute a birth.
[2:32:14] Adam had his bride taken from his body.
[2:32:16] Christ had the bride taken from the
[2:32:17] body. When Christ died, there was three
[2:32:19] elements that came from his body. Water,
[2:32:21] blood, spirit, justification through
[2:32:23] believing water, sanctification through
[2:32:25] the blood, and then the baptism of the
[2:32:26] Holy Spirit. Here we go. Now this last
[2:32:28] great step must come into perfection
[2:32:32] that the Holy Spirit has to live in that
[2:32:36] church so perfectly. So we're not
[2:32:38] talking about teaching and lecturing and
[2:32:40] no no we talking about where it comes to
[2:32:42] the spot where the Holy Spirit begin to
[2:32:43] come down now and begin to live in the
[2:32:46] church live in your life. Live in your
[2:32:49] house live in your home. Your husband
[2:32:51] could feel it from you. Your wife could
[2:32:53] feel it from you. your children, you're
[2:32:55] vibrating of the spirit of God.
[2:32:58] Hallelujah.
[2:32:59] Hallelujah. So perfectly make the head
[2:33:01] and body unit together. See, he is the
[2:33:03] head of the body. Now, oh my Hallelujah.
[2:33:09] Okay. Now, the life that was in the
[2:33:12] stalk and in the tassel in the
[2:33:15] hus. And the life that was in the stalk
[2:33:17] went to make another one. Just to make
[2:33:19] justification make a way for
[2:33:20] sanctification. Sanctification make a
[2:33:22] way for the battle of the Holy Ghost.
[2:33:23] And the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a
[2:33:25] way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[2:33:27] right down to perfection and back to the
[2:33:29] word again to manifest itself. Oh
[2:33:33] hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. May the
[2:33:36] Lord bless you this morning. I want you
[2:33:38] to understand that this is a different
[2:33:40] calling all together. This is not
[2:33:42] visiting the church and you want to have
[2:33:44] fellowship in the church. No, this is a
[2:33:46] higher calling than that. This is you
[2:33:48] want to really connect to Christ. Oh my.
[2:33:51] Hallelujah. all the time. Your cell
[2:33:53] phone dead, it's not ringing, your
[2:33:56] battery dead, you're not even connected
[2:33:58] to the network, you get cut off from
[2:34:00] God. Jesus died. Rewired the whole
[2:34:04] thing. Put a battery in yourself. He
[2:34:07] activated and said, "Child, you could
[2:34:09] call me." Amen. He's on the line now.
[2:34:12] You have the activation. You not just
[2:34:14] have a pretty phone. It's activated by
[2:34:16] the blood. Then he's waiting for your

[2:48:52] Oh, I
[2:48:56] see. Where you lead me
[2:48:59] [Music]
[2:49:02] away, I will go.
[2:49:10] I
[2:49:12] [Music]
[2:49:15] see. I say Can we give the Lord a hand
[2:49:19] of praise this morning? Blessed be the
[2:49:22] name of the
[2:49:23] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:49:26] Hallelujah.
[2:49:28] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:49:31] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, he's worthy
[2:49:34] this
[2:49:35] morning. He's worthy this morning. He is
[2:49:39] worthy this morning. Amen. Can we bow
[2:49:42] our heads in a word of
[2:49:44] prayer? We do have one prayer request
[2:49:48] for Zola Phillip suffering from sickle
[2:49:50] cell anemia born with a sickness but she
[2:49:53] believes God can heal her from sister
[2:49:55] Trisha Puna. Can we bow our heads for a
[2:49:58] word of prayer? Heavenly Father, we
[2:50:00] bring Lord this child before you Father.
[2:50:04] Lord, suffering with the sickle cell
[2:50:06] anemia. Lord, we pray dear God that
[2:50:08] right now you would touch her, minister
[2:50:10] to her, Lord, from the crown of her head
[2:50:13] to the soles of her feet. Father, may
[2:50:15] you, Lord, turn this prayer request into
[2:50:17] a note of praise, Father. And Lord, may
[2:50:19] you search through the camp this
[2:50:21] morning. And Lord, if there's anyone
[2:50:23] sick, Lord, anyone who needs a touch,
[2:50:25] Lord, the enemy is raging. He's
[2:50:27] attacking. But Lord, we know there's a
[2:50:29] bomb in Gileia this morning. There is a
[2:50:31] great physician that we can access this
[2:50:33] morning. So we lift up your people this
[2:50:36] morning, Lord. And we pray that you
[2:50:38] touch each one from the crown of their
[2:50:40] heads to the soles of their feet, Father
[2:50:42] God. Those on the internet, may your
[2:50:44] healing virtue, Lord, move right now,
[2:50:47] Lord, to wherever the need is at, Lord.
[2:50:49] And there's faith, Lord. May you
[2:50:51] activate the faith of your people. And
[2:50:53] now as we prepare to leave this house,
[2:50:56] Lord, but not from your presence, may
[2:50:58] you be with each one. May you touch us,
[2:51:01] Father. Lord, may you, Lord, the word
[2:51:03] that was spoken, find a permanent
[2:51:05] resting place in our hearts, Lord, as we
[2:51:08] get ready to leave this place, Lord.
[2:51:10] Lord, may you bless your servant,
[2:51:12] brother Oie this morning, Lord, for his
[2:51:14] labor of love, Lord, for his burden,
[2:51:17] Lord, to see a bride come to perfection,
[2:51:20] Lord. May you anoint him. May you give
[2:51:21] him strength, Lord. Strength from the
[2:51:24] crown of his head to the soles of his
[2:51:25] feet. Lord, may you bless everyone here
[2:51:27] this morning in the precious name of
[2:51:30] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[2:51:32] "Amen." You may be seated for a few
[2:51:35] announcements before we
[2:51:37] [Music]
[2:51:49] leave. Amen. And uh so we do want to
[2:51:53] welcome some visitors to the church this
[2:51:55] morning. Uh this is Aaron
[2:51:58] Atwell. Please can you stand? Welcome to
[2:52:01] Headstone Tabernacle. Invited by brother
[2:52:03] Steven Oliveri. Welcome. We're happy to
[2:52:06] have you with us. Uh there's Margaret
[2:52:08] Pinda. Welcome to Headstone Tabernacle.
[2:52:11] We're so happy to have you here with us.
[2:52:14] And Melville
[2:52:16] Muhammad, God bless you. Inviting my
[2:52:18] brother Curtis Scaliz. Welcome to the
[2:52:20] Headstone Tabernacle. Thank you. So good
[2:52:23] to have you with us today. So a couple
[2:52:26] quick announcement. This coming Tuesday
[2:52:28] at 7:30 p.m. we will be in Maraval. It
[2:52:31] will be the last service in Maraval
[2:52:34] until after the convention because we
[2:52:37] only have four more Sundays until the
[2:52:39] convention. So for those in the West,
[2:52:42] come out under great expectation uh for
[2:52:45] our last service in Maraval until after
[2:52:47] the convention. We're looking for great
[2:52:49] things to take place. Service will
[2:52:51] continue this Thursday here at the
[2:52:53] church and of course this coming Sunday.
[2:52:56] There will be a very brief, very quick
[2:52:58] choir practice after service today. So,
[2:53:01] we encourage the members of the choir as
[2:53:04] quickly as possible. We want to get that
[2:53:07] practice done um because we want to get
[2:53:10] some work done uh around the church in
[2:53:13] preparation for the convention. And as I
[2:53:15] said before, just as a reminder, there
[2:53:17] are only four Sundays left for the
[2:53:20] convention and there's great
[2:53:22] expectation. We received communication
[2:53:24] from a sister in Australia and Australia
[2:53:26] is very far. Um really in the process of
[2:53:29] trying to make her way over to Trinidad
[2:53:32] to come and fellowship around a seven
[2:53:34] revival. So they're coming from the
[2:53:37] east, from the west, from the north,
[2:53:39] from the south under great expectation.
[2:53:42] And just a reminder, it's going to be
[2:53:45] six services. So, it's going to be two
[2:53:47] services on Friday the 8th of July, two
[2:53:50] services on Saturday the 9th of July,
[2:53:53] and two services on Sunday the 10th of
[2:53:55] July. So, we encourage you make sure and
[2:53:57] get that time available. Um, it should
[2:54:00] be six ministers from six different
[2:54:02] countries will be speaking. We'll be
[2:54:04] announcing more details on that in the
[2:54:06] upcoming weeks, but be under great
[2:54:08] expectation. There'll be some surprises
[2:54:10] here. And you know, God always loves to
[2:54:13] keep some special gifts for his
[2:54:14] children. It's been a long time. He's
[2:54:17] been looking forward for this wedding,
[2:54:19] brother Anthony. You know, he's looking
[2:54:22] to marry this bride called Mrs. Jesus
[2:54:24] Christ. And he's bringing some love
[2:54:26] gifts to shower the bride with before
[2:54:29] she is taken to the wedding supper to,
[2:54:32] you know, so we're looking for God to
[2:54:33] send some love gifts to minister to the
[2:54:35] elect lady who has been chosen from
[2:54:38] before the foundation of the world. Come
[2:54:40] under
[2:54:41] expectation. Bring your shouting shoes.
[2:54:43] So, you should be practicing with your
[2:54:45] shouting shoes from this coming Tuesday,
[2:54:48] this coming Thursday. Make sure you're
[2:54:49] comfortable in your shouting shoes
[2:54:51] because we're going to have some
[2:54:52] shouting. We're going to have some
[2:54:53] singing. We're going to have some
[2:54:55] jumping. We're going to have some
[2:54:56] healings. We're going to have an
[2:54:58] outpouring. We're going to have some
[2:55:00] backsliders being restored. You're going
[2:55:02] to see the cripples walk, the blind eyes
[2:55:04] open. You got to believe it. You got to
[2:55:06] claim it. You got to say it. You got to
[2:55:09] speak it because that's our promise. We
[2:55:11] didn't make the promise. He made the
[2:55:13] promise. And if he made the promise, he
[2:55:15] is big enough to keep the promise. Can
[2:55:18] the church say
[2:55:20] amen? So most importantly, because we
[2:55:23] could do all that we could do, but
[2:55:26] brother Brandham said it will not be
[2:55:27] what we do. It'll be the grace of
[2:55:29] almighty God. So we have to do all
[2:55:32] that's in our power to do. But we
[2:55:34] encourage the church to get desperate,
[2:55:38] get sincere, get in the spirit because
[2:55:40] brother Brandham taught us you get out
[2:55:42] of anything what you put into it. So we
[2:55:45] want to encourage the church. Today is
[2:55:47] the 5th of June. In 3 days we're going
[2:55:49] to have one month countdown to the
[2:55:51] convention. And I know there are many
[2:55:54] needs in this church. And there are
[2:55:55] people coming with needs because they
[2:55:57] are coming to meet God. And I want us to
[2:56:00] be so sensitive apart from all that's
[2:56:02] happening with every department and
[2:56:04] ministry that you spend your time in
[2:56:06] prayer, spend your time on the
[2:56:08] expectation, spend your time fasting,
[2:56:11] spend your time crying and watch God
[2:56:14] meet your needs. Can the church say
[2:56:15] amen? So just to encourage you again,
[2:56:19] service this Tuesday in Maraval. This is
[2:56:21] the last service until after the
[2:56:23] convention. Service is coming Thursday
[2:56:25] here at the tabernacle. There'll be some
[2:56:27] work around the church afterwards. We
[2:56:29] encourage the choir as quickly as
[2:56:31] possible after we are dismissed. We want
[2:56:33] you to assemble us for a very short
[2:56:35] practice. So may the Lord bless you
[2:56:39] musician deacons.
