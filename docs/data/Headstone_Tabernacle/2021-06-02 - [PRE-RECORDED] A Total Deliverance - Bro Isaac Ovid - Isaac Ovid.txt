building this morning and lord in the name of jesus christ we take every spirit under our control for the honor and glory of god this morning father god we plead the blood over the house here this morning we applied a token over the church this morning we applied a token over our houses this morning father me you bless every brother that's here every sister lord everyone that's connected on the internet made the holy spirit lord god sweep into the rooms where they are right now and lord may it be a living ever-present god that we feel here may he be there right now with them father if there's anyone sick this morning may you heal them anyone depress me you raise them up anyone looking for the baptism of the holy ghost may you pour out the holy ghost today lord oh god and most importantly i have a burden this morning for deliverance lord lord there are people in bondage here this morning may you break every chain may you break every shackle may you deliver your people father from every foul spirit every contrary spirit every work of darkness father may you deliver your people by your word and by your spirit by word and power lord present tense redemption by blood and by power lord may you speak from the pages of the bible may you get glory and honor to your name may you take me out of the way father and speak to your people in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen amen amen amen amen give the lord a hand of praise amen so i greet you this morning thank you musicians in the precious name of jesus christ it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of god once more i'd like to get straight to the word if you have your bibles we're going to read from one scripture this morning from the book of exodus we're going to read from exodus chapter 3. i really want to acknowledge the messages last sunday but all his messages what uh what a sunday last sunday was amen amen may god give him strength in his body as he continues to fight the battle and if you haven't heard those messages i encourage you to listen to those messages from last week and you will be blessed amen so really from exodus chapter three and reading from verse seven and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard they cry by reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land onto a good land and a large under a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt shall we bow our heads once more for word of prayer lord god i pray that you bless the reading of the word this morning open our understanding and lord we're not just here to have a service for the formality of it but we are here to see the gospel preached in power and demonstration may you walk out the pages of the bible and speak to your people this morning in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen you may be seated this morning so i have a title this morning and my title this morning is a total deliverance and my inspiration is the egyptians you see today you shall see them [Music] no more and i took a similar thought on wednesday night in the martin and i spoke on coming out of egypt and i brought a thought to the church that no doubt while the children of israel were in egypt they would have observed certain customs and certain traditions that they were used to even if they had to do it in secret there were certain things that were ingrained in them as a people but even though they would worship and even though they would talk about god they were still in bondage and they were still in egypt and there are many people who are in church and they are in egypt but the wrath brother ovid spoke last week and he talked about people walking with the ball and the chain they come in the church but they are tied up they come at the church but they are in bondage and i have a great burden and a great desire to see a total deliverance because that's what jesus came for that's what the message came for and that's what brother branham preached he preached a message called a total deliverance and and that's where i want to strike on this morning because whenever you find yourself in your christian journey and you can't shout and you can't pray and you can't worship and you need to get somebody to support you and push you and move you there's something that needs to be delivered because if you are free you all of a sudden things look different things sound different the world has a different meaning to you you are so excited it doesn't matter what the country does what the government does what your boss does because nothing is tied to you you are delivered from the things of this world you are delivered from the lust of the eyes the laughter the flesh the pride of life you are delivered from trying to make money you are delivered i'm trying to please somebody you are delivered from trying to impress somebody you are delivered from trying to be like somebody else you are delivered from just being like everybody else you are delivered from your past from your failures from your mistakes from your sin from your condemnation and that's what the devil holds over so many of us he holds it over us but when jesus died of blood the blood came to bring a total deliverance god doesn't want part deliverance god don't want you in here shout him and you're gonna go back home to deal with stuff at home god wants to bring a total deliverance up in your house in your marriage in your children your wife has got to be delivered i don't care what condition she is in your husband has got to be delivered doesn't matter to me what's going on your children they've got to be delivered oh can the church say man and you are going to be delivered you are going to be set free the joy of the lord will be your strength the joy of the lord will be all over you nobody's going to have to push you you're going to be pushing your way power because the law and the prophets were until john but since that time the kingdom is preached and every man pressed into it so we are talking about pressing to your deliverance pressing towards your portion pressing towards the holy ghost i can't press for you the pastor cannot press for you the minister cannot press for you your husband can't press for you your children cannot press for you your wife cannot press for you but the kingdom is preached up and every man he pressed himself up so you he came this morning to press up we came this morning desperate because we need to be delivered you may be seated oh it's starting to get a little warmer here this morning and all you holier endowed christians who say i'm already delivered don't you know this body has to be delivered for you to go into the rapture we all need deliverance at some point in our journey we are talking about a total deliverance up you are not totally delivered until you are on your way to the rapture because this flesh has sin built in but one of these days that god is going to change this flesh up he's going to change your mind up he's gonna change your heart he said a new heart i'm gonna give you and i'm gonna put a new spirit inside of there and i'm gonna put my spirit inside of here that's what i'm talking about not coming to church i am tired of church i'm not here to hear a good sermon i'm not here to hear a new mystery i want total deliverance i don't want to be the same way no more i don't want to come to church the same way no more i want to wake up in the morning and say satan where you at i'm coming for my children i'm coming from my family i'm taking back up every inch of ground i've been in punish for so long but i'm crying i'm i'm tired and god has heard the cries of his people and he has come down to deliver you are not doing to deliver him but he has come down and he will deliver he will deliver he will deliver he will deliver he will deliver i don't think you get it but he will deliver it's not your might it's not your power but it's by the spirit of the lord you are going to be delivered from that no praise demon you are going to be delivered from that lust spirit you are going to be delivered from that man in the world that woman in the world the lust of the eyes glory to god oh hallelujah and the egyptians you see today this morning did them goodbye tell them this morning tell them goodbye we have known each other for a long time but the egyptians you see today you saw them this morning you saw them when you woke up you saw them yesterday you saw them last month but the egyptians you see you're gonna see them no more because you're gonna be totally delivered at a house of hell give way to the name of jesus come on young brother come on young system the shackles are being broken don't just sit and watch me oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god oh you pull you press your way we are here to cry for the holy ghost we are here to pull down charity i can't speak for anybody else but as for me and my house brother anthony asked for me and my house we will serve the lord i'm not in the message i'm in the pride and there's a rapture to go to there are some sick people that need healing there are some black sliders that need delivered they are people who are supposed to be in the house of god this morning but the devil has them chained up tied up tangled up wrapped up but this morning we send the bloodhound after them we send the holy ghost after them we send the angel of the lord after them with a mighty strong arm of deliverance this morning we lose the arrow of god's deliverance it's been released it's been released and it's got to come forth it's got to bring forth it's got to be manifested because god said so and so shall it be [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated i'm tired this morning i'm tired this morning enough is enough in my life this morning that's how i feel what good is it to come to church and go back home the same way you came you're wasting your time but this morning i want to go back different i don't want to be part delivered but lord i'm ready this morning for a complete breakthrough a complete deliverance hallelujah you may be seated oh hallelujah oh hallelujah help us this morning jesus i've heard the cries of my people by reason of their task masters by reason you may be seated in the bible says of their taskmasters their cries were not by their own choice their cries would not impress anybody the cries were by reason of their taskmasters the oppression of the taskmasters was so painful was so traumatic was so deep into their lives that they were compelled to crime talking about it didn't work anymore reasoning about it didn't know anymore the only cause of action that was left to them was to cry and god somehow he connects like any father when you hear the baby crying there's a deep call into her teeth and there's a tip to respond up that's why the bible said if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray [Music] hallelujah hallelujah cry sigh desperate desperate no longer accepting things the way they are as if that's your portion your portion is not in egypt your portion is not in the world of what does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul but but isaac this is a simple message yes it's a simple message because people know a lot of stuff but there's still stuff in their closet i'll say that again people know a lot of scriptures but there's still stuff hiding in the closet i'll say it again people read the prophet's message but you could quote me on this there's stuff hiding in the closet well i got news for you the total deliverance is to empty out the closet there's no longer anything hiding in the closet there's no more guilt there's no more shame there's no more condemnation it's underneath the blood underneath oh anybody know what i'm talking about this morning because when it's under the blood and there's no more condemnation with a stephen you could go boldly to the throne and say god it's my promise and i want it there's no condemnation you can come to a prayer meeting different when there's no condemnation but my bible tells me there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus come on now somebody oh the devil's got you tied up tangled up but there's a way of escape this morning that's what the blood came for to pull you out of your condition to deliver you from your situation and to place you positionally in the body of christ you are going to be adopted you are going to be perfected you are going to have seven living virtues can the church say man [Applause] you may be seated you have to forgive me but i have it out for the devil it's a real difference in your walk when you start looking for trouble and this morning i'm looking for trouble because when the children of israel had to go into the promised land they were looking for trouble the enemy didn't expect him but god told them in the bible i come to bring you out and take them up out of that land onto a good land and a large onto a land flowing with milk and honey they didn't get milk and honey in egypt but there was a promise of milk and honey and unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites in other words it's not going to be an easy walk to get to that land flowing with milk and honey you're going to have to deal with the canaanites and all of their spirits and all of their situations and when you overcome them you're going to have to deal with the hittites and when you finish with them you're going to have to deal with the amorites so i don't know who you fighting this morning but i've got news for you keep on fighting maybe it's the parasites but they're going to be finished too maybe it's the heaviest but we are coming for them maybe it's a jebusites up but every inch of ground we are taken back this morning come on you sons of god draw your swords this morning wherever there's a item tell them we are looking for them we are not back in town there's no compromise to the baptism of the holy ghost there is no compromise to total healing there's no compromise to sister christine's eyes of being open i will not compromise on the young people's revival i will not compromise on the young people being delivered i will not compromise until i see everything [Applause] every name written shall be delivered every name shall be delivered that's my scripture that's my promise that's my inheritance every name shall be delivered of every name shall be delivered how do you know your name is there there's a connection to the word when the word is preached you say amen there's something it's not your literal name but when i talk about the holy ghostland you like that's me in there when i talk about adoption you're talking about me when i talk about perfection you are talking about me when you talk about a super church you're talking about me oh hallelujah i'm warming up we haven't started yet brother kangali jayden we haven't started yet we haven't started yet we are going to take back every black slide up we are tell them we are coming for them put it on facebook put it on instagram put it on twitter email them text them we are taking them back from the devil he has no right he has no right he has no right putting his hands up on the sons and daughters of the blood washed ones up god told noah get thee and thy house into the arkham he never spoke to his family he spoke to noah well god spoke to me and i'm bringing my family i'm bringing my loved ones hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god oh hallelujah oh hallelujah everybody on your feet stand to your feet right now and give god worship everybody stand to your feet and give god worship we're gonna do something different this morning i'm gonna fight for every inch of ground i'm gonna fight until the chains fall off i'm gonna fight until the sick is healed we're gonna call for fire we're gonna preach for fire we're gonna reach for fire hallelujah satan you missed me satan you thought you had me but i'm free this morning i'm free this morning every minute a chain is being broken every minute a shackle is being broken every minute diabetes is under attack this morning female condition under attack kidney problem under attack high blood pressure under attack we serve notice the egyptians you see today you shall see them no more what sin what sin could stop the gospel of jesus christ when there's blood seven thunder blood [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah in every kind of church there are three kinds of believers i understand that brother branham taught us that but you see the true believers in this church we have a responsibility to make a revival to turn the temperature in this place so hot that the unbelievers will be uncomfortable and the make-believers will be uncomfortable don't let somebody gummed up with condemnation but eat and wait into the service you worship god downstairs outside in the back you praise god because the promise of the holy ghost is for you [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] i feel like brother over this morning my guns are loaded this morning but deterrence i got all kind of guns green names rocket launchers i'm heavily armed i'm almost dangerous there's a fugitive look out for me right now i'm a fugitive of the devil's kingdom i escaped this morning i escaped they're looking for me this morning but i escaped and i'm armed and dangerous i'm almost dangerous because i'm here this morning to help other sons escape to help other daughters escape we have been in bondage for too long but i got news for you it's a good land it's poured milk and honey it's the holy ghost ladder it's my portion [Applause] oh hallelujah we are the escape ones you may be seated from a message of total deliverance but the branham said and this is why i feel so radical this morning but the brandon said we want complete deliverance we don't want to be a halfway church we want to be a real church or no church at all send me home if you want to play games but if you want to be a real church [Applause] you may be seated but the brandon said we want to be real christians or no christians at all we want total deliverance from our habits from our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence when you neglect to pray and you neglect to read and you neglect the fast and you neglect to be in the spirit we want deliverance so it's not about coming to church but it's about that daily walk up walking like jesus talking like jesus living like jesus we want total deliverance from our habits the stuff that is hard for you to break that's what we come against this morning the stuff that you act you accepted as this is who i am that's what we're coming for this morning the stuff that you wrongly claim that is how god make me and my attitude that's what we're coming for this morning that part of you that can't talk to your brother can't talk to your neighbor can't love your enemy that's what we're coming for this morning any behavior any attitude any action any conduct that is not christ-like we serve it notice this morning [Applause] and listen to what the prophet said we want total deliverance there's also a purpose so that when people come into this church to be prayed for they'll be just this little group maybe not over a hundred or two setting here but they'll be completely in the hands of god and when we pray then god will hear from heaven god wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say i got confidence in i can send this my sick servant to the branham tabernacle at jeffersonville and this morning i could say i could send this my sick servant to the headstone tabernacle in trinidad and that group of people and one are called i claim it for this church that's my job to claim it for this church every minister should claim it for their church but i'm claiming it for this church that the sick could walk in here and we pray and they are healed [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] a total total surrender total commitment total sacrifice completely yielded only his will only his plans only his words only his places that he wants you to go redemption we know is in two parts it's coming out of and it's going into you can't go into until you come out of and within the church there are people at different stages those who have come out of stuff and you have yet to go in those who haven't come out they're those who doing the death walk walking around in circles one day you're in the victory and you're conquering and shouting then two weeks later you can't find yourself you have lost the joy you've lost the zeal you've lost the passion you find yourself like david but david didn't just sit there and say lord i'm depressed he said lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation your salvation supposed to come with joy you can be saved and you're sad and depressed there's there's joy that's supposed to be complimentary with your salvation so when david found himself in a deep hole he said lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation and renew renew a right spirit because i had it before but lord i lost it but this morning renew a right spirit a right spirit to your word a right spirit to church a right spirit about prayer right spirit to the neighbor a right spirit to the co-worker right spirit to my husband a right spirit to my wife renew renew a right spirit [Music] friends this gospel is something that has to be lived somebody must feel the effects of this gospel you must leave this service and your wife must say you are different towards me your husband must say you are different towards me your co-workers must realize that there's a difference [Applause] because you are coming towards the right spirit [Applause] christ [Music] something begins to stir in your life and we're going to get to the quote i'll read it maybe later on but i'll say it now but the branham said the disciples were totally delivered because and listen carefully they were completely filled with the holy ghost no that's a powerhouse so their lives were a certain way because they were filled with the holy ghost amber branham said if you claim to have the holy spirit or you claim to have the holy ghost and your life is then lining up with that he said yes you have a ghost yes you have a spirit but it's not the holy ghost it's not the holy spirit because the holy ghost can behave itself in one person and misbehaving somebody else or holy ghost has a certain conduct holy ghost a certain behavior the holy ghost could only agree with the word the holy ghost could only love and forgive and drop oughts that's that such a achievement of the holy ghost somebody's saying man [Applause] and that is why the devil fights this holy ghost so much because it's all right to come to church but don't let them get the holy ghost because the moment you get the holy ghost but the man said it gives you power power to pray that's not you saying our father that's not you saying a simba that's power to intercede power to enter in power to enter into somebody else's suffering to give you power to live a holy life oh is there anybody in the house wants to live a holy life well then your cry your prayer your desire should be lord i want the holy ghost i want to be completely delivered can the church say man i pray this morning that in some way you would get jolted back to reality friends it is a struggle i was sharing with my wife and i believe i shared it on thursday night in the canopy service i said that the hardest thing is to keep the dove the hardest thing is to keep focused the hardest thing is to keep this as the priority because the devil is so good at the distractions you have to work and you have to do this and you have to do this and you find yourself going around in circles and at the end of the day you have nothing to show for it because the house can't take you there the car can't take you there the family can't even take you there your academic qualifications cannot take you there your status in the world cannot take you there being a deacon elder minister or pastor is not taking you there only perfect love can take you there only the holy ghost itself can take you there only the life of christ itself can take you there only the token itself could take you there and that's what we are doing striving to enter him before the terrible plague strike oh hallelujah come a message a total deliverance for the balaam said that's the way moses and his group did they got over there and got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total deliverance moses himself he was unified with god but israel wasn't there still was sin and they murdered against moses and they said why do you care about this you bring more trouble upon us because pharaoh said to tally to double the bricks and so forth but that was moses he was completely in the hands of god totally delivered from sheepherding to heard god sheep he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because they were still murmuring among them but then brother brother went to he said but that one night when god ordained that the lamb should be killed a type of christ and the blood was dipped in hyssop which is like weeds come and humble and put over the lintel of the door and on the post and that's when israel become completely delivered not a hoof left behind all that belonged to them was delivered their families their loved ones and everything was delivered when they completely come under the blood [Applause] but the brandon said that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought under the blood then there'll be a total deliverance if you have wronged somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it something won't let you do it when yourself is completely totally brought under the blood there'll be a total deliverance then you'll have a freedom like you have never known before when everything's brought under the blood brought in submissive to the kingdom of god then there'll be a real deliverance can the church say man with abraham said all jesus works was complete jesus was never halfway never did anything halfway amen i love it when the man with the palsy was brought by his friends and they couldn't get him into jesus because the place was crowded and he they dropping through the ceiling the first thing jesus did your sins are forgiven it's after the movement and the pharisees see who is this man to forgive said he said pick up the bed and walk and god was saying here's what i'm here to give total deliverance deliverance from your sickness deliverance from your mind deliverance from sin amen and it's a powerful statement because jesus was telling people go and sin no more and he hadn't even died yet and he was speaking of listen a lot of people don't understand that you can live without sin you know amen amen that when christ himself is feeling you and you only speak in his words and you only live in his walk and you only talk in his store and you are now perfect watson watson completely redeemed total redemption the weight of saying no has no more effect on your life the devil can't reach you because you are different viewer just like your father can the church say amen so all jesus's work was complete everything was complete total deliverance he totally delivered the leper from leprosy hallelujah he totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live on the privileged people there's no need for us to live in a defeated state because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal right to rule you they are only squatting they have no legal rights to be there but the balance said we are christians filled with the holy ghost we don't have the devil dictate to us let me say that one more time we don't have the devil dictate to us christ delivered us some total deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from habits and delivered us from talking he delivered us from all kinds of smarty things up he totally delivered us up and put us into his holy hands of complete total deliverance can the church say hands and is where brother branham said the disciples had total deliverance absolutely total deliverance why because they were completely and totally filled up with the holy ghost and when you chest a church member and shook the pastor's hand or had some kind of a little experience of jumping or shouting or speaking in tongues or something another and still have malice in your heart strange acts telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting after woman there's something hasn't happened yet there's something wrong can the church say man but this morning we want to make it all right this morning by seeing the holy ghost bring a total deliverance that there will be evidence that you have met the pillar of fire somebody say amen so we are not just talking this morning about the god of yesterday it's easy to talk about what god did but this morning i want to talk about what god is doing right now because right now it's present tense redemption you are being redeemed by the word of you are being redeemed by blood but there's coming power redemption by power to push you into your inheritance can the church see man oh hallelujah oh glory to god you didn't find this message you didn't find this place but this message found you because you were predestinated with such a time as this and god will never give you more than you compare he told peter satan has desire to sift you like wheat but i prayed for you i pray that your faith don't fail when you feel the breath don't fail when you feel like giving up don't fail because i've prayed for you that says the devil trying to sift you but keep focused focus on what on the holy ghost keep focus on what on the promised land keep focused on what on the inheritance can the church say man this morning we are talking about a jubilee that's what the total deliverance is up it's a jubilee time again it's another time of life it's the devil have to let you go and he can't put you back no more somebody say man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god you may be seated i hear everything you say but you don't know how much licks i'm under you don't know how much whip the taskmaster hit me last week you have no idea how much the pressure has intensified you don't have any clue of how much problems and situations i have to deal with well i've got news for you this morning and i share this last week as well i said listen when the time for the declaration of emancipation was coming the slave owners knew that there was a cow long on so naturally as the time is cutting down they would intensify what they were doing to the slaves they would beaten them more because they didn't want to see them go but i want to encourage you the more intense it gets it means you're getting closer to being free because the devil he doesn't want to lose you he never let you just walk away so if it's getting hot in your life you better be confident that your breakthrough is right there the more the trials get hot and the city wasn't getting hot it's your breakthrough is right there because satan knows he's on a countdown he knows his time is up time is already no more we are breaking into eternity satan you could do your last punch but this is it in three days i'm out of here two more days you can beat me how much you want but it's a countdown [Applause] somebody say man oh glory glory glory glory glory so you are going to go free you want to be free from sin free from your doubt free from your past free from condemnation free from the stuff that you want to give up and you can't give up yes you're going to be free from that too but abraham said i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's happened since the days of jesus he's talking about this group right here right now the devil thinks he has you but satan just keep watching just keep watching the story because god already knows the ending listen that should be the greatest encouragement to you satan doesn't know the end of your story but god knows the end of your story because he's the author and he's the finisher and he's the one writing the story you might think the middle of the story is a rough patch but there's going to be an ending and god is in control of the ending somebody's saying man [Applause] oh glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah oh hallelujah so what what are we contending for the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the world because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word so we are trying to make sure that the world is preached with such power and such effectiveness that you can leave this place and you go into your prayer closet and you begin to plead the promises for you and for your house some something has to happen when you leave service you have a responsibility every single day but ibrahim said as long as god's got a people god's got a church god's got the holy ghost marching with it that's what the holy ghost was given for intellectuals will rise but god's got a minority somewhere god's got a little church listen that will move right on with the baptism of the holy ghost to claim in the light that's why i said we will settle for nothing less than the baptism of the holy ghost i don't want nothing less than the baptism of the holy ghost if i gotta hold on i'll be home to the altar every day i'm not compromising without receiving the holy ghost somebody's saying man the egyptians you see today he will see them no more the task masters really did a number on the children of israel because as they were running out of egypt and they thought they were free pharaoh said you know what i'm not going to let them go that easily and he'll lose the chariots after them the children of israel were not soldiers they were not fighters and as they felt cornered by the shame with the red sea in front and mountain on both sides some were wondering why did we come out here why are things so hot in my life why am i facing so much trial maybe we should just go back and tell them we're coming back in peace hallelujah and even moses got caught up in the euphoria of the moment on saturday cry he said oh gosh oh gosh and god say why cry just speak and move forward don't cry this morning just speak to your situation and move forward god already brought you out of that situation god brought you out of the nomination god brought you out of the world god brought you into this holy ghost message land and and just keep speaking and moving forward and moses stretched out his hands and the reds he opened up and he uttered a prophecy i don't even know if he if the people really understood what he was saying but he said the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever and the children of israel did what they had never witnessed before they began to walk through the red sea you can imagine the jubilee the shouting because this was it now this was god in display but the brand i'm calling redemption by power it was redemption by blood with the token and the death angel but it was redemption by power this was god's power to take them through the journey brother what a jubilee what a shout and know that listen the enemy is behind me but god has made it away from me and nothing could stop me when it looked like i couldn't keep on moving god moved this society push this society push this aside he pushed this assad because i'm on my way to the promised land but listen while the oppression while they are pushing pharaoh says don't let them get away don't let them get away and he begins to run after them but i got news for you this morning whatever demon is still running after you we serve them notice this morning they've got to call they've got to go they've got to go [Applause] hallelujah and god destroyed them that day and brought a mighty victory to the children of israel mighty victory deliverance from the grip of satan deliverance from egypt so friends i encourage you this morning no matter what the challenge is the trial is the situation is your life keep fighting keep pressing keep the promise real in your heart but ibrahim said in the message shalom they always here either if i've if i could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live in i'd say no right now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom oh the real church of the living god ought to be on fire burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them that's how we are supposed to be every single day on fire every single day pray it up every single day reading every single day on the expectation because we are counting down to our jubilee we are counting down to leaving this place we are counting down to no more sin to no more sickness to no more depression to no more no more no more can the church say amen god's desire is to have a bride that would walk like him act like him live like him and most importantly speak like him can the church say amen now notice brother branham said in the message redemption in completeness and joy he said we are taking israel now in their journey coming out of egypt and brother branham said putin every week i sat down and read through the book of exodus if i can oh as much of it as i can i love it because it's a perfect type of the church today the condition and how god is moving what he did in a natural then he's doing in the spiritual now now we are moved now that now there he led israel natural when the scene looked moved out of a certain land into another natural land but now we are moved by the holy spirit into the promised land and we are on the road to the promised land can the church say amen but ibrahim in the same message redemption and completeness and joy he said then what's the next thing for the believer the next thing is the baptism of the holy spirit then amen and we want to keep focus on that it's the baptism of the holy ghost then now notice this is by the branham he said i wanted this to sing deep here [Music] i'm going to let this sink deep down i hope it goes way down moses the greatest prophet ever lived oh just let me pull back a little bit every believer when you come in and you are saved accept the blood of jesus you still try to hang on to this and hang on to that and you can give up and you can give that up and this up and while god may do good things for you you just can't give up certain things but what you need to do is pass through the red sea and when they come out on the other side hear this i want you to see it as they come out on the other side crawl up on the bank and look back and seeing all those task masters who had beaten them killed some of them and when they looked back and saw all those things struggling helpless and dying and i said brother you talk about the meeting they had could you imagine a day when you are completely free from everything you've been struggling with fighting with but everybody said you gotta pass through your red sea and look back and see listen they're all dead they're all finished what a joy to look back and say for all these years i've had to deal with this situation i had to deal with this back pain i've had to deal with this problem i've had struggles with this but now you can look back and say listen it's not just a world only but they are actually dead they are finished no more holding me no more can the church say amen [Applause] oh hallelujah moses but ibrahim said oh i'm going to let this sing deep i hope it goes way down moses greatest prophet ever lived outside of jesus christ never was a man that god ever spoke to like he did moses outside of christ he said if there'd be one who is spiritual or prophet among you i'll show him visions and make myself known to him but not my servant moses i speak lip to ear with him moses this dignified man as soon as he come through that experience he's seen all those masters dead he knowed all them things was gone forever then oh my all those things that had drove them and beat them and whipped them around was finished he raised his hands and sang in the spirit oh my never been typed won't be until we get to glory of yonder when the completion was made there he sang in the spirit but the brother said that was a type of the holy spirit coming at pentecost when we passed through the sea it was a type of pentecost hallelujah are not when that body is perfect redeemed without our soul is perfectly redeemed cannot perish god everlasting life oh but the man said oh i feel good notice why because i know it's just saith the lord just anchor my soul there and walk and i say satan jesus all you want to to me but don't bother me because i know whom i have believed i'm persuaded he's able to keep that which i've committed to him against this day can the church say amen said notice then when our bodies are redeemed which we got divine healing now was a shadow in other words but the bible said divine healing is just a shadow of being redeemed because his body is going to be changed that was just a shadow of pentecost can the church say amen i'm not going to be too much longer with you amen said coming out of the fiery furnace was a shadow of what was to come away from the lion and alliance then was a shadow of what was to come everything was a shadow by the shadow of pentecost but now we have perfect redemption through the blood of christ he said they in those days couldn't have perfect redemption because it was under the blood of bulls and goats it will not take away the sin it only covered the sin but when jesus blood was shed the most holy righteous blood sin wasn't covered no more they were divorced and done with and the believer goes in the presence of his makeup can the church say amen and but the brethren said now he said if they acted that way in the shadow of moses singing in the spirit when he saw the egyptians dead then what about us talk about the holy ghost meeting when they got over that bank over there he talked about miriam beating a tambourine and they were just talking about deliverance from the natural task masters what kind of singing we will have with the terence when we make it on the other side when we are delivered from this body and delivered from this mind can the church say man oh hallelujah hallelujah so what are we talking about we're seeing a total deliverance is complete redemption that's what we're talking about not just you delivered from smoking and drinking that's the baby stuff we're talking about deliverance to one day you just walk and you're not found no more just like enoch we're talking about complete deliverance that you are no more just 16 elements but there's another element called the holy ghost supercharging these 16 elements we are talking about a new walk a new talk a new way a new life can the church say [Music] [Applause] the substance our bodies are groaning and we have an inheritance and we are children now heirs of the kingdom kings and priests unto god offering spiritual sacrifices what's a spiritual sacrifice it's a sacrifice when you don't feel like doing it that's what makes it a sacrifice when it costs you something that's what makes it a sacrifice and coming to church is supposed to be a sacrifice because it against your natural nature but when you get a new nature you can't help but come to church you can't help but rejoice with the word you can't help but be in fellowship what does a priest do he makes a sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests they are making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices you say brother branham i just don't feel like praising him that's the time to make the sacrifice praise him anyhow kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifices i just don't feel i praise him praise them anyhow i don't feel like shouting shout anyhow i don't feel like praying pray anyhow i don't feel like dancing dance anyhow that's how you confuse the enemy when he expects you to be depressed you wish you praise god anyhow you shout anyhow you are under fire but there's something on the inside keeps you moving whatever you do don't stop moving whatever you do don't stop moving can you maybe see that but the battle goes on while we are groaning for the kangaroo veil in this tabernacle of humiliation this tabernacle that has failed we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption back like we was in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden in other words god is longing for us to be completely delivered to put us in the position we should have been if adam hadn't fallen god is looking for the day when sons in this day could be just like adam we already saw but the brandon was a type doing things that adam would have done but one of these days we're gonna have some more sons we'll be just like adam we're gonna have some more sons that will be completely delivered who will beat back into their position he may be seated so malachi 4 left us a shout message with the promise of dynamics to our mechanics which is present tense redemption with power can the church say amen he gave us a shout and the shout was the fullness of the atonement in the church ages they had the atonement but malachi 4 brought the fullness of the atonement which is the blood which loses the holy spirit which was bound for two thousand years and then give us a promise of dynamics to our mechanics so now we are stepping forth boldly that's why we could preach the promises because we are looking for the spirit that will be on the pride to come down here as dynamics to the mechanics as the holy ghost itself to give you a chance to anoint the word seas that have been in your soul for all these years you've been coming and hearing the word there's more to it than just hearing the word there's coming a day that the rain the holy spirit will bring the world to life and then all all that you couldn't do you'll be able to do and even greater than these because that's a promise created and these shall you do that's your promise of dynamics to the mechanics that's the total deliverance oh you don't hear me this morning [Applause] you may be seated what are you saying brother isaac i'm not saying you just want to be delivered and get healed no we're talking about being positionally placed we don't have being adopted we're talking about being a condition and when the time for the rapture comes you're ready to go brother said divine healing is a shadow that's that's that that's a that's a simple thing but the venom said if you can't even have faith for divine healing or you're going to have faith for the rapture but we want to make it to the rapture that's our promise rapture is my promise change our body is my promise my family is my promise on the way to there i'm going to be healed i'm going to be delivered my son is going to be restored my wife is going to be that's on the journey but i have a destination and no devil is going to stop that destination no team is going to stop that destination no friend no boy no girl nothing will stop that destination [Applause] [Music] one day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in christ shall rifles them old testament scenes back yonder who are waiting will blast forth and come up to their fullest and go into the resurrection and we drop right in line going into the sky those old mortal bodies change and made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that will be when it starts heaven one some of these days in that rapture in time that lays ahead oh listen proudly displaying the blood of jesus christ upon their chest the message of god in the hour that they lived in that's all we're looking forward to so the blood of jesus christ on their chest is the message of god in the hour they lived in so we have to live our message we have to live it because this is the age we are living in and in this age we have to live every age gone past because of the final age this is the final voice this is the final people and everything that worked in every age now gathered in this age of what was in paul's age in martin luther colombia everybody is now in this age and now we will told you we were proudly we are sons of the living god we are daughters of the living god we are gonna have faith we're gonna have virtue we're gonna have knowledge we're gonna have temperance we're gonna have patience we're gonna have calliness we're gonna have brotherly kindness we're gonna forgive we're gonna have a super church we're gonna have a clean church we're gonna have a church without spot without wrinkle washed by the blood of the lamb a real church a super church a delivered church a restored church can the church say amen oh hallelujah oh i'm getting ready to close out in a short while god wanting to place his church in position in the masjid adoption god let me live to see it is my prayer so close till i could almost feel it but the pranama's looking for it to see the church come back into power all these years the church has been backslidden from that alpha church the church went on in the crowd and never had the same power that the alpha church had but god was restoring this fallen church this church that was buried this church that died up because god doesn't want to see anybody backslidden he doesn't want to see you down he doesn't want to see you defeated but also god knows that he can't deliver unless there's somebody to be delivered he can't restore unless there's somebody to be restored up and god knew all along he said that they are mountains and they are valleys and they are blue flowers and they are red flowers so god in the passage of your life allowed all kinds of things to happen to bring to the spot that he could get the glory for delivering you from the lion's den delivering you from the fiery furnace delivering you from goliath if the lord is with me i would be able to drive them out that's what caleb said and we will have the same testimony if it wasn't for the lord we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the lord we would not have made it he is the deliverer of he is the mighty conqueror he delivered daniel he delivers shadrach he delivered meshach he delivered up and nicole he delivered joseph he delivered samson he delivered elijah he delivered noah he delivered abraham he delivered isaac what about me he is still a deliverer he delivered oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated that's why when the children of israel were locked up in egypt god was troubled he said i've heard their cries by reason of their task masters and i didn't send a representative i don't want to send anybody else but i have come down i want to be here for this one i'm not going to trust anybody else but i have come down to deliver them i have come down could you imagine almighty god he left heaven and sat on a mountaintop to say i have come down on the earth because my people the first time god used the word my people was in exodus three he said ma i've heard the cries of my people and i believe in 2015 there's a cry that's going out and god has heard the cries of his people and he has already descended he is already here a south message he already here oh glory hallelujah i've come now to deliver i've come now to pour out the holy ghost i've come now to bring a revival i've come down to set the order in church i've come now to deliver your loved one i've come now to heal the sick i've come now to restore the backsliders and not one shall be left behind oh glory to god somebody say man total deliverance total deliverance total deliverance another time of jubilee another time of jubilee the jubilee hour is on this is the time of the jubilee now is the accepted hour now is the time this is the acceptable year of the lord but ibrahimovic said and downloads all things you know now is when the whole the healing is supposed to be now is when miracles take place now is when christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off but now is the team this is the hour this is the time and that's why i say this morning the egyptians you see today you should see them no more you have to make up your mind you're not gonna wait until tomorrow you're not gonna wait until the next service you're not gonna wait until any time but now you claim that you said to dave it's my day i'm not leaving this place in the same condition if i gotta come to the altar i'll come to the altar if the elders that'll pray for me they gotta pray for me but i am gonna be different i'm gonna be changed can the church say man oh the musician gonna get ready to come [Applause] up

the branham preacher by the rising of the sun he said the young men who went to see the sun rise they had to run to the top of the mountain because the older ones they couldn't see the sunrise and
