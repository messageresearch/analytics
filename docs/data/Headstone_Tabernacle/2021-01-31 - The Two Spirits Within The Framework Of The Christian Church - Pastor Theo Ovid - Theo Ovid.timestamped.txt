[25:33] second peter 1
[25:34] 47 and 2nd timothy 3 on the knights that
[25:37] we appreciate
[25:38] message last sunday from brother stephen
[25:40] the pride of superchurch
[25:42] a super race she's near the great
[25:43] headstone amen so we're going to share
[25:46] some things that will tie into that
[25:47] but we are grateful to be here tonight
[25:50] till this morning ii peter 1
[25:55] 4 says here whereby a given unto us
[25:59] succeeding great and precious promises
[26:01] that by these he might be partakers of
[26:03] the divine nature having escaped
[26:05] the corruption that is in the world you
[26:07] lust and besides this
[26:10] given all diligence add to your faith
[26:12] virtue and to virtue knowledge
[26:14] under knowledge temperance and the
[26:15] temperance patience and the patience
[26:17] godliness
[26:18] and to godliness broadly kindness and to
[26:21] bodily kindness
[26:22] charity and we want to go to second
[26:25] timothy 3
[26:27] remember verse 1. this is paul
[26:31] given this warning this know also
[26:35] that in the last days perilous time
[26:37] shall come
[26:38] for men shall be lovers of their own
[26:40] selves covetous
[26:41] boasters proud blasphemers
[26:44] disobedient to parents and thankful and
[26:46] holy without natural affection truth
[26:49] breakers
[26:50] false accusers and continent fears
[26:53] despises of those that are good
[26:55] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[26:58] pleasures
[26:59] more than lovers of god having a form of
[27:01] godliness
[27:03] but denying the power thereof from such
[27:05] tune away for this is the sword
[27:07] are they which creep into houses and
[27:10] lead captive silly women
[27:13] leading with sins led away with divers
[27:15] lust
[27:16] evolution and never able to come
[27:20] to the knowledge of the truth now as
[27:22] janus and jambes which said moses
[27:24] so these also resist the truth men of
[27:28] corrupt minds
[27:29] reprobate concerning the faith another
[27:32] message the fate
[27:33] but they shall proceed no further for
[27:35] their folly
[27:37] shall be manifest unto all men as dears
[27:40] also was let's pray one more time
[27:41] heavenly father we thank you for your
[27:43] word take me out of the way lord and
[27:45] touch me this morning
[27:46] i need your help and be with me jesus
[27:48] and speak to our hearts take me out of
[27:50] the way and be glorified
[27:51] in jesus christ and you may be seated oh
[27:54] praise the lord
[27:56] this morning we have a title the two
[27:59] spirits
[28:00] working within the two spirits within
[28:02] the framework
[28:04] of the christian church that's the title
[28:06] that
[28:07] the two spirits within the framework of
[28:10] the christian church
[28:11] and um i have a sort of thought
[28:13] inspiration it is not only what you are
[28:15] fighting for
[28:17] but also what you are fighting against
[28:19] let me say it again it's not only what
[28:21] you're fighting for
[28:22] but it's also what you're fighting
[28:24] against so you're not just fighting for
[28:26] something
[28:27] but you have to know what is against you
[28:30] what you are fighting against
[28:32] in order to really effectively win this
[28:34] battle
[28:35] so we are coming down to have this time
[28:36] now where the wheat
[28:38] would be guarded in and matthew 13 jesus
[28:42] said let them both grow together
[28:44] until the harvest but in the time of the
[28:47] harvest
[28:48] i will say to the reapers gather ye
[28:50] first the tears
[28:51] buying them in bundles to burn them but
[28:53] guarded wheat into my ban
[28:55] so it's two things here until the
[28:57] harvest and in the time of the harvest
[29:00] i would like to say this way when you're
[29:01] preparing for christmas to have a turkey
[29:03] or something like that
[29:04] you have the time of the end and the end
[29:05] of time for the turkey
[29:07] hallelujah praise god harvest time
[29:10] the time of the end and then when the
[29:13] neck neck get cut off that's the end of
[29:14] time for that
[29:16] so there's harvest time the harvest time
[29:17] is on right now hallelujah the reapers
[29:20] is coming
[29:21] oh glory to god go there put the seed
[29:23] for nothing you a family plan sees
[29:25] just as he sees apartment plants seed
[29:27] because they expect a crop
[29:30] so god plants seeds and he expects a
[29:33] crop
[29:34] oh glory to god do you believe that so
[29:36] there are two churches or two crops
[29:39] oh glory to god at the harvest time and
[29:42] every one of those two churches have
[29:43] ministers
[29:44] oh glory to god the bride is second
[29:47] peter one four through seven
[29:49] that's that that's the bright spirit
[29:51] their ministers is from ephesians 4
[29:54] 11-13 like the fight for ministry
[29:57] and satan ministers is from matthew 24
[30:00] 24.
[30:01] false anointed ones and his church is
[30:03] what we read there
[30:04] second timothy tree oh glory to god
[30:07] that's the devil's
[30:08] church and that the church gonna fight
[30:10] the bride
[30:11] and that's the bride gonna fight that
[30:12] church that's a spirit no
[30:14] all glory though just two spirits not 27
[30:16] spirits two spirits
[30:18] main spirits and that's what you're up
[30:20] against
[30:21] oh glory to god that's why you couldn't
[30:23] miss this for nothing
[30:24] god brought you out for a purpose god
[30:27] keep people
[30:27] back sitting to keep them out of the
[30:29] church mess you see the woman at the
[30:31] well god kept you out of the buckingham
[30:33] with the pharisees and described any
[30:34] sadducees
[30:36] oh glory to god because she was ordained
[30:38] to meet messiah
[30:39] she was not dead to sit on long in her
[30:41] church she ordained to meet messiah
[30:44] and their people ordained just to meet
[30:46] messiah
[30:48] which is manifested word
[30:51] glory to god hallelujah glory
[30:55] thank you lord jesus so the church
[30:57] ministry the ministry
[30:59] of the church church spirits is matthew
[31:01] 24 24
[31:03] false anointed ones false teachers
[31:06] praise god first timothy 4 1 says now
[31:09] the spirit
[31:10] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[31:13] times
[31:14] some shall depart from the faith defeat
[31:18] and give heat to seducing spirits and
[31:20] doctrines of
[31:21] devils so if you say devil's just
[31:24] smoking and drinking there is a doctrine
[31:26] too
[31:27] so you have to know what you are hearing
[31:29] because the spirit in every earth said
[31:31] he'd
[31:31] have an air to hear let him hear what
[31:34] the spirit is saying unto the churches
[31:37] and the spirit could only bring the word
[31:39] let me say it again the spirit could
[31:40] only bring the word
[31:42] the true spirit the omega interpretation
[31:44] of the word
[31:45] the spirit brings the word oh glory to
[31:48] god amen
[31:50] so brother branham now from uh this is
[31:52] in time evangelism he said
[31:54] uh intellectual heady high-minded lovers
[31:56] of pleasures more than lovers of god i'm
[31:58] quoting scripture
[31:59] the holy spirit speaks expressively that
[32:01] this would take place at the end time
[32:03] there'll be incontinent despises of
[32:05] those that are right haters of those who
[32:07] believe the word see
[32:08] like those pharisees and sadducees they
[32:10] hated jesus why
[32:12] because he was contradicting their creed
[32:15] not that he wanted two to be different
[32:17] but he must live he was the word
[32:19] the living word isn't that right now
[32:21] notice praise god
[32:22] in this intellectual age heavy i minded
[32:24] still wins the night to watch
[32:26] uh we love lucy or we love susie and so
[32:29] on like that
[32:30] he said instead attending the prayer
[32:31] meeting lovers of pleasures more than
[32:33] lovers of god
[32:34] haiti high-minded you say they are
[32:36] communists no they are not
[32:38] they are church members you mean in this
[32:41] message
[32:46] the tears in them outside but the two
[32:48] spirits
[32:50] would be so close did you hear that
[32:53] it will deceive the very elect so you
[32:55] can't play with this word
[32:59] anything against this word is the enemy
[33:02] anything against this truth is the enemy
[33:05] because the word itself is god
[33:07] hallelujah
[33:09] you say they are communists no they are
[33:10] not they are church members
[33:12] having a form of godliness denying the
[33:15] power
[33:15] thereof having a form of god but say
[33:19] god doesn't do these things there's no
[33:21] power to it
[33:22] just accept and do this and that no
[33:24] change of life nothing

[49:40] that you could have access to heavenly
[49:41] father isn't that something today amen
[49:44] so whereas in the old testament was debt
[49:46] to go in now is that to be out
[49:48] then you have to press your way to be in
[49:50] god's presence and stay dear
[49:55] romans 12 verse 9 says let love be
[49:59] without this
[49:59] dissimilation uphold that which is evil
[50:03] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[50:05] affection one to another with broadly
[50:08] love
[50:08] in honor preferring one love you see the
[50:11] spirit not through full and business
[50:13] fluent in spirit serving the lord
[50:15] rejoicing in hope patience and
[50:17] tribulation
[50:19] continue the instant in prayer
[50:21] distributing to the necessity of these
[50:23] saints
[50:23] given to hospitality bless them which
[50:27] persecute you
[50:28] bless and curse not
[50:32] rejoice with them that do rejoice
[50:36] just remember that problem with that one
[50:37] year when they get blessed so they carry
[50:40] joystill they're jealous
[50:42] jealousy killing them but you see you
[50:44] have to get all that out your system
[50:46] and then you can apply the word your
[50:48] brother bless you rejoice with him
[50:50] say tell god give him a double portion
[50:53] oh glory to god you don't know what he
[50:54] has been true
[50:55] you don't know what hell he has been
[50:57] true you don't know what temptations he
[50:59] has been through
[51:00] and how you overcome oh glory to god and
[51:03] god change his name and change his work
[51:05] you see jacob walking so you don't know
[51:07] how we get at walk
[51:09] yeah again an accident you know he
[51:11] wrestled all night long
[51:13] so he can't walk normal something
[51:15] happened to him
[51:16] and just as something happened to him
[51:18] something has to happen to you
[51:20] oh give the lord some praises
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:25] all right rejoice with them that do
[51:27] rejoice weep with them that weep
[51:29] be of the same mind one towards another
[51:32] minor high things
[51:33] but condescending men of lower state be
[51:36] not wise in your own conceits
[51:38] recompense to no man evil for evil
[51:42] provide things honest in the sight of
[51:44] all men if
[51:45] it be possible as much as light in you
[51:48] live peaceably
[51:50] with all men daily beloved avenge not
[51:53] yourselves but rather give peace
[51:54] unto wrath for it is written vengeance
[51:57] is mine
[51:58] i will repeat says the lord let god
[51:59] repeat therefore here we go
[52:02] if thy enemy is hunger feed them
[52:05] don't say hungry good laying dead are
[52:08] you barely walk
[52:11] they suck sword no that's not
[52:13] christianity like church member business
[52:16] no sock salt no if you're enemy hunger
[52:19] feed they're not friends you know
[52:21] there's not family at all
[52:22] hey it was a macaroni pie you want some
[52:25] cheese you want some taste you want a
[52:26] burger there's not that channel
[52:28] this is the enemy you know there's
[52:30] somebody who will not do good for you
[52:35] that's why you must stop making excuses
[52:37] and make it a
[52:38] choice in your life to do what you need
[52:40] to do
[52:41] that is my motto i help because i want
[52:44] to help
[52:45] i love because i choose to love i act
[52:47] because i want to act
[52:48] whether you respond that is your
[52:50] business
[52:52] if you hit me back that is your business
[52:54] i will still give you because i want to
[52:56] give you
[52:56] you want to hear that is a business i
[52:58] want to love you
[53:00] you are the holy horse i want to forgive
[53:02] or give the lord up
[53:04] my choice i choose that i choose to walk
[53:07] in forgiveness
[53:08] oh glory to god i choose to walk in
[53:10] brotherly kindness
[53:14] you know why because our revelation
[53:16] broke 1981
[53:17] on broadly kindness i was behind it but
[53:19] i said god forgive me why can't i
[53:21] forgive you
[53:22] and when i caught the revelation i can
[53:24] hold out against nobody
[53:26] because i know i brotherly kindness give
[53:27] me access to the holy spirit
[53:29] or give the lord a shout and i want to
[53:32] keep that access
[53:33] i want to keep that connection and then
[53:36] you break that
[53:37] you lost it all or give the lord some
[53:40] praises
[53:41] that's why he said when you stand
[53:42] praying
[53:44] forgive if you are old against any
[53:51] so right there is a key if you want to
[53:54] access spirit
[53:56] you have to come to this highlight of
[53:59] brotherly kindness god put the spirit
[54:03] on top of brotherly kindness you have to
[54:06] forgive look at jesus he's the father
[54:08] forgive them and what they say crucify
[54:11] him crucify him
[54:12] he dead yet you're looking for him to
[54:15] die he said father forgive them
[54:17] one man on the cross say why are you
[54:19] save us and save yourself too another
[54:20] man said lord remember me
[54:24] the old thief was everybody just shut
[54:25] him out
[54:27] with his crooks that man did nothing
[54:30] she said today you'll be with me
[54:34] now man i went to one service yeah who
[54:36] once spoke one book he listened to one
[54:37] tape yeah baptized in jesus name and he
[54:40] hear words here today you will be in
[54:43] oh that should make you want to
[54:47] shout this morning
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:49] [Music]
[54:50] god is sovereign he could save your son
[54:53] he could save your daughter he could
[54:55] save your marriage he could save your
[54:57] life
[54:58] he could fill you with the holy ghost he
[55:00] could heal you this morning
[55:06] all right therefore the enemy hunger
[55:09] feed him
[55:09] if he does give him drink for in so
[55:11] doing you he calls a fire on his head
[55:13] do not be overcome with evil do be not
[55:16] overcome of evil
[55:17] but overcome evil with good overcome
[55:20] evil with good
[55:21] what is faith it is something that
[55:23] revealed to you that is not yet
[55:25] but you believe it will be faith is a
[55:27] revelation
[55:28] of the will of god is not right and
[55:31] that's what the church is built upon
[55:33] revelation divine
[55:34] revelation so listen this i want to
[55:36] share something with you
[55:38] you can be informed by knowledge
[55:42] or you could be informed by revelation
[55:45] vote is information
[55:48] the difference revelation comes from
[55:50] above
[55:51] and it comes with stimulation
[55:54] knowledge is intellectual truth
[55:58] it is truth but it is intellectual truth
[56:01] it is not the same as revelation it's
[56:04] the same information
[56:06] but this one come by revelation flesh
[56:08] and blood hath not revealed it unto you
[56:11] that's why the devil's job is to fight
[56:12] you to come in the spirit
[56:15] because only the spirit could give you
[56:16] revelation
[56:18] as long as you sit in your flesh you
[56:20] only get an information
[56:23] knowledge of truth intellectual but if
[56:25] you get to your spirit
[56:27] you stand a chance you have an
[56:29] opportunity
[56:30] to become a channel that the spirit
[56:33] could descend
[56:35] and you get a vertical a vertical
[56:37] connection
[56:38] [Music]
[56:40] why the word is going horizontal the
[56:43] political spirit come down
[56:45] and reveal it to you and that's the rock
[56:48] that the devil can't change
[56:50] that's the rock upon which he built his
[56:51] church
[56:56] so that explains how some churches are
[56:58] dead and have
[57:00] thousands of people but stoned
[57:04] the minister behind the pulpit he did
[57:06] too
[57:09] but the people is intellectually
[57:11] stimulated in the gray matter
[57:14] they have no spirit there no revealing
[57:17] anointing
[57:19] because that reveal and anointing brings
[57:20] stimulation
[57:22] you know where stimulation is you ever
[57:25] died in the nighttime and you say you
[57:26] want a cup of coffee
[57:28] the coffees are stimulant you know just
[57:30] keep your eye open
[57:31] i want an eye opener drink a hot cup of
[57:34] coffee
[57:35] keep your eye up to finish what you have
[57:36] to do well wine is also a stimulant
[57:40] man drinking water when linking his head
[57:42] his lips lick his lips
[57:44] drinking wine i said i got glasses that
[57:47] they talk different
[57:48] hallelujah because he's drinking wine
[57:51] drinking water and drinking wine is not
[57:52] the same thing
[57:54] the word is the water but when
[57:56] revelation comes
[57:57] wine and wine have stimulation in it
[58:00] that's why jesus said you can't take new
[58:04] wine
[58:05] which is what we bring in this morning
[58:07] and put it in all bottles
[58:09] because when you put wine in bottle it's
[58:11] not
[58:12] glass bottle a skin bottle
[58:15] it does ferment in a stretch
[58:19] it'll stand up it has raised the hand
[58:22] the place has got too small after a
[58:24] while because it's revelation
[58:27] that coming by stimulation it does
[58:30] something on the inside
[58:31] oh give the lord a shout not something
[58:34] in your head
[58:36] something on your heart oh glory to god
[58:40] glory glory
[58:43] glory
[58:44] [Music]
[58:48] you think intellectual knowledge of isa
[58:50] could not keep abraham
[58:54] it's because the man of revelation he
[58:55] stuck at night
[58:57] he couldn't explain to sarah see right
[58:59] here whatever god himself
[59:02] told me i am going to have a sunny miser
[59:06] see her he heard me she eyes and she
[59:07] ears she heard
[59:10] but that hit and she hurt at all because
[59:12] god had speak to her
[59:14] you only ever say or to catch that it's
[59:17] for the spirit to reveal it to her
[59:19] so when abraham was going on the offer
[59:21] by zac he said he let me going up
[59:23] and i will not be coming back down he's
[59:25] not doing his head
[59:27] he's in faith that's why he was 11 is so
[59:30] clear
[59:31] prophet moses by faith jeff tag by faith
[59:35] samson
[59:36] joshua and by faith you
[59:40] do i have shout in the house you're not
[59:42] praising god because you're feeling the
[59:44] praise god
[59:45] god know what you're going through you
[59:47] raise your hand by faith you say amen by
[59:49] faith you stand up you give god blessed
[59:51] [Music]
[59:54] [Applause]
[59:58] wait a minute you figured he appreciated
[1:00:01] money multiple times
[1:00:03] a newsfeed it has some real terrible
[1:00:06] values you know
[1:00:11] every day is a war
[1:00:20] so watch so both are truths
[1:00:23] or both information is true but they
[1:00:26] come into different ways
[1:00:28] but there is another layer to this and
[1:00:30] this layer is the spirit of truth
[1:00:33] so the truth can be spoken preached
[1:00:35] exalted or shared
[1:00:37] and showed without the spirit of truth
[1:00:40] but you can see clearly why god
[1:00:42] said i would jesus said i rather have
[1:00:44] someone write in their spirit
[1:00:46] and wrong in their doctrine than someone
[1:00:49] who is writing the doctrine and wrong in
[1:00:50] their spirit
[1:00:52] no we know god didn't send a prophet for
[1:00:53] us to be right induction and wrong in
[1:00:54] the spirit
[1:00:55] no we have to be right in spirit and
[1:00:58] write induction also
[1:00:59] do you believe that amen so let me just
[1:01:02] hit the home stretch here
[1:01:10] but i'm talking about uh chicken chicken
[1:01:13] like a chicken if you lay egg a hen if
[1:01:16] she hasn't been with the male bird
[1:01:18] rooster it will never hatch
[1:01:19] it is unfull tile and that's the way
[1:01:22] with people who profess
[1:01:23] christ many of them look like christians
[1:01:26] try to act like christians but you have
[1:01:28] to got to have christ on the inside of
[1:01:29] you
[1:01:30] which is the word made manifest or it
[1:01:32] will never mature into a real bible even
[1:01:34] christians
[1:01:35] so therefore just like church members
[1:01:36] you can baby them call them make them
[1:01:38] dickens everything else
[1:01:39] you have a nest full of rotten eggs
[1:01:41] unless they have mated with the meat
[1:01:43] so in other words god have to give you a
[1:01:45] supernatural touch not yourself smoking
[1:01:46] stop drinking
[1:01:48] the buddhist could do that so this is
[1:01:51] not that this is not abhorrence here you
[1:01:53] stop doing this stuff in the uh
[1:01:54] party you know you're right you come out
[1:01:57] but you have to go in
[1:01:59] so in other words something supernatural
[1:02:00] have to take place in your life
[1:02:05] this community is not supernatural
[1:02:06] enough despite working here
[1:02:08] but right there you sit down on your pew
[1:02:10] you have to warn something supernatural
[1:02:13] you have thousands of people going to
[1:02:14] church this morning and hearing messages
[1:02:16] and
[1:02:16] living the same way they're just doing
[1:02:18] their duty
[1:02:24] some some people do they're not on
[1:02:25] facebook on social media church churches
[1:02:27] and social media
[1:02:29] when they go to church they see this
[1:02:31] that their facebook
[1:02:33] they're seeing faces there's where they
[1:02:35] meet people and say hello hi
[1:02:37] you follow what i'm saying so when jesus
[1:02:40] came he came to produce a revolution
[1:02:42] he came and made the traditions set in
[1:02:44] their ways pharisees scribe sadducees
[1:02:47] hallelujah but i miss them all them
[1:02:49] people with all the degrees and all this
[1:02:51] so he said you know they have seeds out
[1:02:53] there and he
[1:02:55] ain't go to them and say pharisees you
[1:02:56] know i want to introduce myself i'm
[1:02:57] jesus and you know i know they're
[1:02:58] reading this school is a long time
[1:03:00] and you are the people who are supposed
[1:03:01] to get this revelation he didn't do that
[1:03:03] he said peter come
[1:03:04] on andrew come i said a bunch of
[1:03:08] fishermen them came read and write
[1:03:10] and he called them to show that this is
[1:03:11] not my might or power
[1:03:13] but the callings by the spirit so when
[1:03:15] the spirit called them the spirit had to
[1:03:17] reveal things to them
[1:03:18] peter said that what the christ next man
[1:03:20] peter said though shall not go undying
[1:03:22] you're gonna die jesus said get behind
[1:03:24] me satan
[1:03:25] just rebuke them bust them straight them
[1:03:27] out love them care for them
[1:03:28] tell them after converted striking the
[1:03:30] brethren they were sons of god
[1:03:32] they were just like you and i strugglers
[1:03:34] and stragglers
[1:03:35] fighters and warriors but they have a
[1:03:38] destination to get to the upper room
[1:03:40] because you know the opponent will fix
[1:03:42] them up that's where they get the
[1:03:43] vaccination
[1:03:44] inoculation praise god hallelujah
[1:03:47] praise god for all them disease and
[1:03:48] viruses that lucifer had out there
[1:03:51] oh glory to god and when they get out of
[1:03:53] the upper room and get the first dose
[1:03:55] oh glory to god they were so charged up
[1:03:58] and peter staggered out of the upper
[1:03:59] room
[1:04:00] fully inoculated fully protected he says
[1:04:03] still van gogh had i
[1:04:04] none i could share this thing you know
[1:04:07] because this thing flowing through me
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:09] i'm anointed i'm appointed i'm
[1:04:12] commissioned
[1:04:13] i have life inside of me i have healing
[1:04:16] inside of me of power
[1:04:18] inside of me where i am i give it to you
[1:04:22] [Applause]
[1:04:24] that is what god wants to do through you
[1:04:26] that's what god wants to do by you
[1:04:28] glory to god god and make you a little
[1:04:32] higher than the animals
[1:04:33] he make you a little lord and angels
[1:04:35] give the lord some praises
[1:04:37] he made man a little older than the
[1:04:39] angels
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:47] so you talk about the shock remember
[1:04:48] there's no more he promised to woman
[1:04:51] after mary so what's what
[1:04:54] higa sarah mary
[1:04:58] three woman and after mary was the
[1:05:00] promised seed
[1:05:01] no more woman to come after that just he
[1:05:04] promised seed
[1:05:05] now notice how close it is matthew said
[1:05:07] 24 24 the two spirits in the last days
[1:05:10] listen though we nail it down here now
[1:05:12] the church spirit
[1:05:15] of the church people and the bright
[1:05:18] spirit of the bright people
[1:05:20] would be so close till it would receive
[1:05:23] the very elected as possible
[1:05:24] he called it a church spirit of what the
[1:05:27] church people
[1:05:29] and the pride spirit of the bright
[1:05:32] people
[1:05:33] and i'm identifying the bright spirit as
[1:05:35] seven perfect spirits
[1:05:37] as reflected in second peter 1 4 7. all
[1:05:40] hell is against that
[1:05:42] every demon in hell against that because
[1:05:45] that is original
[1:05:50] you know all this computer all this
[1:05:52] program all the things you're doing
[1:05:54] you're pressing this and doing whatsapp
[1:05:55] and typing
[1:05:56] there's a source code behind that
[1:06:00] you are seeing the front part but behind
[1:06:02] that
[1:06:03] have what you call resource code and
[1:06:06] that source code written
[1:06:08] copyrighted what not is what they call
[1:06:09] the original code
[1:06:12] now sometimes they allowed what you call
[1:06:14] open source
[1:06:15] where people can directly access it and
[1:06:17] they have what you call closed source
[1:06:18] like apple and certain companies
[1:06:20] you kind of tamper with what is behind
[1:06:21] here others have it that you could go
[1:06:24] into it
[1:06:25] and that's why some companies have
[1:06:26] different skins over their phone like
[1:06:27] samsung have android and have a certain
[1:06:29] way
[1:06:29] and they phone a certain way but behind
[1:06:31] that have original code
[1:06:33] and they put a layer on top of it well
[1:06:35] god called his original code
[1:06:38] source code original source and meant to
[1:06:40] stamp and twist and make it say all kind
[1:06:42] of thing
[1:06:45] but if you'll ever ever if you ever want
[1:06:47] to know what is right you go back to the
[1:06:48] original source
[1:06:51] and that is why it's your right to check
[1:06:54] out to see if these things be so
[1:06:55] yeah if it was being spoken and being
[1:06:58] taught if it's in the word because they
[1:07:00] want to get back to the original source
[1:07:01] isn't that right
[1:07:02] so but imam says this here he says
[1:07:04] there's got to be something that cannot
[1:07:06] be denominated
[1:07:08] it is the entirety of the life has
[1:07:11] to produce itself again on the bride
[1:07:14] what is the entire picture of their life
[1:07:16] second peter 147
[1:07:17] that is christ spirit to be back in the
[1:07:20] church
[1:07:21] that is the only thing that cannot be
[1:07:23] denominated
[1:07:24] what cannot be nominated the life
[1:07:28] isn't that right there cannot be any
[1:07:30] more churches you see
[1:07:31] you said no watch the full word okay so
[1:07:34] the life leaves the shock
[1:07:35] and the shock is a carrier and that's
[1:07:37] just exactly what our denomination has
[1:07:39] been a carrier
[1:07:40] so that is why you can't who under
[1:07:41] baptist method this week all of them had
[1:07:43] a portion of their life at a time
[1:07:45] but their life move on because the life
[1:07:47] that they plant in the sea the travel
[1:07:49] truths talk and whatnot it
[1:07:50] must end back up in the seed so god said
[1:07:52] i'm alpha and omega and the rest in
[1:07:54] between his processes so the seed i was
[1:07:56] planting the pentecost went through
[1:07:57] processes
[1:07:58] and end up with you that is why your age
[1:08:02] bride is have to come after pentecost
[1:08:04] which is a shock
[1:08:05] because you are coming back to the
[1:08:06] original green oceans do you believe
[1:08:08] that
[1:08:10] oh glory that means if we go back to
[1:08:11] original brain we have to manifest what
[1:08:13] those
[1:08:13] elites had nothing less than that
[1:08:16] having church is not what the holy
[1:08:18] spirit had having groups and
[1:08:20] and fellowships that's not what the
[1:08:21] church had they had the same life same
[1:08:23] signs
[1:08:23] same wonders same power man fall dead in
[1:08:25] church race on the dead continue
[1:08:27] preaching
[1:08:27] same life do you believe that
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:33] so justification will save a man you
[1:08:34] believe that it was a carrier of the
[1:08:36] word
[1:08:37] a carrier it in the life then a long
[1:08:39] come signification then come pentecost
[1:08:41] the restoration of the gifts
[1:08:42] and when you come down to see when you
[1:08:43] come to say i and my father won
[1:08:45] and these are the things then the shock
[1:08:47] pulls away but the real
[1:08:49] genuine bride church will bring forth
[1:08:52] the entire
[1:08:54] word of god in its fullness and in its
[1:08:57] strength
[1:08:58] oh i'm looking for that he's the same
[1:08:59] yesterday today and forever oh praise
[1:09:02] god
[1:09:02] and at the opening of the seven seas
[1:09:04] revelation 10 the full word
[1:09:06] is to be born into manifestation so we
[1:09:09] lost the world to seven ages right
[1:09:11] got it to gather all the word and bring
[1:09:12] the forward back and then he promised
[1:09:14] that the footwork will be born
[1:09:16] into manifestation isn't that right the
[1:09:19] shockers gave fortitude strengthened to
[1:09:21] the seed
[1:09:21] it went out of it it went on out it was
[1:09:24] a good shock it's silver's time
[1:09:26] but it is a world ride of the weird room
[1:09:29] three denominational ages carriers
[1:09:32] which also must die and dry up just like
[1:09:34] the shock and soul fought
[1:09:36] to give room for the seed the seed here
[1:09:38] we go
[1:09:39] cannot get right cannot get right
[1:09:42] until the shock stalk leaves all dry
[1:09:47] that's right it sucks every bit of the
[1:09:49] life in them
[1:09:50] and and that's it it's virgin wood time
[1:09:53] not touched
[1:09:54] it you put you said there will be no
[1:09:55] denominational manhandling
[1:09:57] of the virgin boot of the bride so i'm
[1:09:59] skipping too quickly i want to wrap up
[1:10:01] now what she is now a dry shock
[1:10:04] the spirit of god passed through her is
[1:10:07] true
[1:10:08] that is why people have testimonies 20
[1:10:10] years ago 20 years ago what god do with
[1:10:11] them they have no testimony now
[1:10:13] because the spirit used to be with them
[1:10:18] did you hear that that's why they don't
[1:10:20] go back in over the history you know
[1:10:21] because i want to know going on now
[1:10:23] because when you see me yesterday you
[1:10:25] see him today since they go back too far
[1:10:27] that's good god was with them god was
[1:10:29] and so 20 years and 30 years ago working
[1:10:31] in them
[1:10:32] what is happening right now because no
[1:10:35] faith is isn't that right
[1:10:37] hallelujah so what she is dry shocked
[1:10:40] the spirit of god passed through her
[1:10:41] and will not listen this is important
[1:10:44] she
[1:10:45] this church will not be heir with the
[1:10:47] vindicated seed word
[1:10:49] she will not be in the rapture so this
[1:10:52] second timothy tree spirit
[1:10:54] will not be in the rapture you are part
[1:10:56] of that you were involved in that you
[1:10:58] connected with that
[1:10:58] no rapture for you the bride is going in
[1:11:01] the rapture
[1:11:02] and that is what going in the rapture
[1:11:04] give me a quote he said this being
[1:11:06] is the servant of god in the church of
[1:11:09] god
[1:11:10] this being when it's completed is the
[1:11:13] servant of god
[1:11:14] in the church of god that's going in the
[1:11:16] rapture
[1:11:17] so when that is completed in you you're
[1:11:19] going in the rapture
[1:11:21] rapture will be inside of you oh no
[1:11:23] rapture coming for you you have the
[1:11:24] rapture
[1:11:26] oh glory to god right now you have the
[1:11:27] rapture in mechanic formed
[1:11:29] but that seed would have to clean the
[1:11:30] dynamics that seed would have to be
[1:11:33] transformed into the kingdom of god
[1:11:35] oh glory to god thereby jesus behold the
[1:11:37] kingdom is within you
[1:11:39] god put the seed inside of you devil
[1:11:41] can't go inside there there
[1:11:42] the word alone is the desire of the
[1:11:44] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:11:47] god know what he put inside of you
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:51] that why when you were backstage god was
[1:11:53] laughing
[1:11:55] because the devil didn't know who you
[1:11:56] were you didn't know who you were
[1:11:58] but when god ready and he set the alarm
[1:12:01] clock
[1:12:02] ready to find you you couldn't help it
[1:12:04] you had to stagger out of what you're
[1:12:06] interested
[1:12:06] into this oh my hallelujah
[1:12:10] so watch so the seed will produce itself
[1:12:15] it's the same yesterday and forever
[1:12:17] that's wood scene again
[1:12:19] the seed will produce
[1:12:23] itself you put a coin see the cargo
[1:12:26] mango tree from that
[1:12:28] the seed will produce itself
[1:12:32] same pill of fire showing the same signs
[1:12:34] the same wonders
[1:12:36] watch so it has to be a reproduction of
[1:12:38] the green here what he said
[1:12:39] a spirit comes upon the bride to do the
[1:12:42] same thing he did
[1:12:43] it's the reproducing again of the green
[1:12:46] which is the original green
[1:12:48] how could we reproduce it without the
[1:12:50] spirit coming upon us
[1:12:52] even jesus had to get his spirit upon
[1:12:54] him he said the spirit is upon me
[1:12:59] i'm not hearing you when the spirit came
[1:13:02] along upon him when john was about to
[1:13:03] baptize
[1:13:04] he saw the dove coming upon jesus
[1:13:08] and that dove led him into the
[1:13:09] wilderness to overcome satan
[1:13:11] and satan still didn't know who that
[1:13:13] really was that's why i saved though we
[1:13:14] as though we and jesus blessed him with
[1:13:16] the words written it is written it is
[1:13:18] also written
[1:13:19] so for all these years we ripping with
[1:13:21] the word because the devil only have two
[1:13:23] to two options
[1:13:26] send matthew 24 24 along with second
[1:13:29] timothy tree
[1:13:30] to try to deceive you and when he got
[1:13:33] received
[1:13:34] he recognized now he had to make war
[1:13:36] with the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:13:39] because you on your way to the rapture
[1:13:42] oh glory to god i feel inspired right
[1:13:44] now
[1:13:45] do you understand the devil hole attempt
[1:13:47] was to deceive the bride
[1:13:49] but he cannot it's impossible
[1:13:53] guess why guess why the bribe will not
[1:13:56] be received
[1:13:57] because the bride will be the word
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:05] the bride will become the word
[1:14:09] itself and that word will defeat the
[1:14:12] devil
[1:14:13] anywhere anytime
[1:14:16] any place under any condition
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:25] oh glory glory
[1:14:29] glory and with the wreck revelation
[1:14:32] nobody can mess up with your head
[1:14:37] glory but whatever
[1:14:41] and the same holy spirit that was in
[1:14:44] jesus
[1:14:45] will have to be operating in his church
[1:14:48] to make them coincide together at the
[1:14:50] rapture
[1:14:50] or it won't go so don't tell me i'm
[1:14:54] crazy
[1:14:55] i am not i want to see the same spirit
[1:14:58] and don't tell me i'm a man and you know
[1:15:00] no no his blood died
[1:15:02] he paid the price that his blood could
[1:15:04] sanctify us
[1:15:06] to give us access rights
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:11] that god could use us for his glory

[1:18:26] but these two spirits the real spirits
[1:18:28] will be so close it receives very
[1:18:29] elected
[1:18:30] they was working side by side in the
[1:18:32] last days there's some demonology
[1:18:34] he said now what they're looking over
[1:18:35] the top of the real thing he said but
[1:18:37] i'm talking
[1:18:39] a lot of your time taking a lot of time
[1:18:41] but you got to see this
[1:18:42] friend if i never see you again you got
[1:18:44] to know what demons are
[1:18:46] you got to know what truth and error is
[1:18:48] and it's so close
[1:18:49] you got to separate the thing let's give
[1:18:52] a picture here now
[1:18:54] he said no there are blackness and gaity
[1:18:56] and so on two forces i want to skip that
[1:18:58] oh my all right he said they're men
[1:19:02] my dear christian friends demons are
[1:19:04] working on every hand and god's spirit
[1:19:06] is moving right out
[1:19:07] on the other hand to counteract it every
[1:19:09] time there you are
[1:19:11] now what demons working yesterday i had
[1:19:13] them in the physical realm
[1:19:14] today i'm showing you in the spiritual
[1:19:16] realm where they are at
[1:19:17] in the religious realm in the natural
[1:19:19] realm they're called cancer
[1:19:21] and called this that the other but they
[1:19:22] are devils and over here
[1:19:24] in the religious realm they are pious
[1:19:29] esau was a very religious man he said
[1:19:32] now watch
[1:19:33] he said no and today many people are
[1:19:34] listening and so many people are
[1:19:36] listening to enticing spirits
[1:19:38] instead of taking the word of god so
[1:19:41] something spirit talking something come
[1:19:43] to you and something tell i hear a voice
[1:19:44] yeah there's something void by the word
[1:19:46] you'll just run with every voice that
[1:19:48] talk to you they ever talking to you
[1:19:49] have mountain
[1:19:51] hallelujah that's spread fallen 400
[1:19:53] prophets i mean the prophecy ally
[1:19:55] one time brother branham was going and
[1:19:57] castle the epileptic spirit he asked the
[1:19:59] people to bow there close the eye
[1:20:00] irreverent
[1:20:00] and a bunch of people started carrying
[1:20:02] on they're watching he said please and
[1:20:03] whatnot
[1:20:04] and the spirit leave he said the spirit
[1:20:05] gonna leave and he swear to leave and
[1:20:07] follow all of them
[1:20:08] all of them take up epilepsy after that
[1:20:10] the spirit you're talking about
[1:20:12] oh glory to god bride spirit and church
[1:20:15] spirit
[1:20:16] oh holy spirit and demon spirit but the
[1:20:18] reception is in the religious realm
[1:20:20] because church people having a form of
[1:20:23] godliness
[1:20:24] oh glory to god hallelujah but abram
[1:20:27] says enticing spirits coming down
[1:20:29] substituting something from the word of
[1:20:30] god there is nothing to substitute faith
[1:20:32] faith has no substitute hope will never
[1:20:35] take the place of faith
[1:20:36] faith is alone it stands alone
[1:20:39] hope can never take its place isn't that
[1:20:41] right
[1:20:42] watch the old fella down here the
[1:20:44] prophet the preacher he was so sure he
[1:20:46] was right
[1:20:47] he made himself a pair of horns and
[1:20:48] danced around and remember what the
[1:20:49] prophet said if god talked to me if you
[1:20:51] come back why didn't you talk to me
[1:20:53] are you feeling anointed and carrying on
[1:20:55] he said because we can be so emotional
[1:20:57] don't mean that you're saved because you
[1:21:00] go to church don't mean we are saved
[1:21:02] don't believe those entities and spirits
[1:21:04] a real spirit of god
[1:21:06] is the truth of god which is the seed of
[1:21:09] god
[1:21:10] will produce god in your life and be
[1:21:12] godly and saintly and holy
[1:21:16] among a lot of people we find where the
[1:21:18] emotions and so forth
[1:21:20] they become tattlings and back titans
[1:21:22] and all kind of godly things that's
[1:21:24] sulfuric acid
[1:21:25] and it's demon powers spirit of men and
[1:21:28] women who get among one another
[1:21:30] this is not right this is not right
[1:21:32] that's not right
[1:21:33] if you chase it down nine times out of
[1:21:35] ten is the very person
[1:21:37] making this still that is not right
[1:21:42] but as long as you know your life is
[1:21:44] deviant with the bible with purity of
[1:21:46] heart
[1:21:46] preaching of thought love towards your
[1:21:48] brother trying your best to
[1:21:50] build the kingdom of god doing those
[1:21:51] things dressing right living right
[1:21:53] you say you gotta have all the emotions
[1:21:54] you want to do and everybody would
[1:21:55] believe it o
[1:21:56] praise the name of the lord thank you
[1:21:58] lord oh praise god
[1:22:00] mission comma please thank you lord
[1:22:02] jesus hallelujah
[1:22:04] let's continue he said now watch
[1:22:07] these two spirits they are so close that
[1:22:10] they will receive the very elective
[1:22:12] possible
[1:22:12] these are you ready these two spirits
[1:22:17] are marking their people for future
[1:22:19] judgment

[1:22:26] the spirits saying this is minds this is
[1:22:29] minds

[1:22:33] marked
[1:22:33] now judgment come later
[1:22:36] the bride that has been marked your
[1:22:39] judgment will be the rapture

[1:22:47] the church member spirit their judgment
[1:22:48] is true and i have tribulation period
[1:22:52] that is judgment that church members in
[1:22:54] this message
[1:22:57] people do believe it have a tribulation
[1:23:00] you're talking about the woman in in in
[1:23:02] america
[1:23:04] is that judgment coming after you know

[1:23:20] up
[1:23:21] and we have to be ready
[1:23:24] these two spirits are marking their
[1:23:26] people for future judgment
[1:23:28] oh my hallelujah they're skipping
[1:23:30] through
[1:23:31] i'm almost finished i was president of
[1:23:35] getty at this time about a steve
[1:23:37] message let me show you
[1:23:40] the reason why satan hates this book of
[1:23:41] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:43] in the church he knows that jesus christ
[1:23:47] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:50] and he changes not he knows that a whole
[1:23:52] lot more than do 90
[1:23:54] of the illusions he knows that since god
[1:23:56] is immutable in his nature he's also
[1:23:58] immutable in his weight which is
[1:23:59] unchangeable right
[1:24:00] does satan knows assuredly that the
[1:24:02] original church
[1:24:03] talk about the original source code
[1:24:05] original church
[1:24:07] at pentecost with the power of god mark
[1:24:09] 16 and action
[1:24:10] is the true church not mark 16
[1:24:14] explanation
[1:24:16] mark 16 in action action and explanation
[1:24:20] is two different things so we're not
[1:24:22] talking about
[1:24:23] teachings and revelations and
[1:24:26] explanations we talk about it in action
[1:24:31] thus satan knows that the original
[1:24:33] church at pentecost
[1:24:35] with the power of god max is in action
[1:24:37] is the true church of jesus claim as his
[1:24:38] own
[1:24:39] all else is false
[1:24:43] let me say it again all else
[1:24:46] is false now remember
[1:24:50] christ in the true church is a
[1:24:52] continuation of the book of acts
[1:24:54] and the book of revelation shows how the
[1:24:56] antichrist spirit
[1:24:58] would come into the church and defile it
[1:24:59] making it lukewarm
[1:25:01] formal and powerless lukewarm
[1:25:05] formal powerless lukewarm formal
[1:25:08] poreless all they have is
[1:25:09] a nice preacher
[1:25:12] but that is not the original church
[1:25:14] because the original church had christ
[1:25:16] walking
[1:25:17] among them isn't that right it exposes
[1:25:20] satan revealing his works attempted
[1:25:22] destruction of god's people and the
[1:25:23] spreading of god's word
[1:25:24] right down to the time he's cast on
[1:25:25] liquor fire he fights that
[1:25:28] he cannot stand it here we go he knows
[1:25:31] this is where i get the whole thought
[1:25:32] from if the people get the true
[1:25:35] revelation
[1:25:36] of the true church what she is one
[1:25:40] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:25:43] the greater works
[1:25:44] she will be an invincible army
[1:25:48] what does brothers even preach a super
[1:25:50] church a super race
[1:25:52] as she has a headstone oh glory to god
[1:25:55] do you think the devil just oakman says
[1:25:57] justin no
[1:26:01] you're seeing what you're up against now
[1:26:03] oh hallelujah
[1:26:05] watch he knows that if the people get a
[1:26:07] true evolution
[1:26:08] of the true church what she is and what
[1:26:10] she stands for that she can do the
[1:26:12] greater works she will be invisible army
[1:26:14] if they get a true revelation here we go
[1:26:17] of the two spirits
[1:26:19] within the framework of the christian
[1:26:21] church
[1:26:22] and when they get a revelation what you
[1:26:23] do next and by god's spirit
[1:26:25] discern and withstand
[1:26:30] you mean all is part of the package we
[1:26:32] are reaching super church if we got this
[1:26:33] here and with stan you know
[1:26:35] yeah i'm jumped into a spirit center oh
[1:26:37] hallelujah discern
[1:26:39] and withstand watch the antichrist
[1:26:42] spirit
[1:26:42] satan will be powerless before her oh
[1:26:45] glory to god
[1:26:47] he will be definitely taught it today as
[1:26:50] when christ withstood his
[1:26:51] every effort to gain power over him
[1:26:54] satan hates revelation
[1:26:55] but we love it with true revelation in
[1:26:57] our lives the case of hell
[1:26:59] cannot prevail against us but we will
[1:27:02] reveal
[1:27:02] against them so this morning i pray and
[1:27:05] trust god give you a revelation
[1:27:07] of the two spirits praise god put it
[1:27:09] like two spirits working in your life
[1:27:12] oh glory to god the bad animal and the

[1:28:13] you want him to bring them up to the
[1:28:14] promised land you see friends

[1:28:36] have helped only study the self
[1:28:38] and the goodness itself they failed to
[1:28:41] see who they could have served
[1:28:42] who they could have brought along with
[1:28:44] them this beautiful journey

[1:42:35] hey amen we do have a
[1:42:39] prayer request two prayer requests
[1:42:41] actually so
[1:42:42] uh sister donaque looking for prayer for
[1:42:45] her daughter-in-law chanel clark who
[1:42:48] is suddenly having severe abdominal pain
[1:42:50] and bleeding and being taken to the
[1:42:51] hospital that god would
[1:42:53] intervene and destroy the plans of the
[1:42:56] enemy
[1:42:57] in the name of jesus christ you could
[1:42:58] play something softly
[1:43:00] and i also want to uh with us to pray
[1:43:03] for our pastor this morning
[1:43:05] and uh you know he preached this morning
[1:43:08] and few would know how much peen he was
[1:43:10] in uh whether anthony had to help him
[1:43:12] put on his jacket this morning
[1:43:14] just over there to help him to get
[1:43:16] dressed this morning and
[1:43:18] he had to drive with one hand he's
[1:43:20] getting some tremendous pain in his
[1:43:22] right shoulder and his right arm he
[1:43:24] didn't even sleep that much last night
[1:43:27] he had to sleep on the ground actually
[1:43:30] so much pain so we want to remember him
[1:43:32] in prayer
[1:43:33] knowing that the enemy is fighting but
[1:43:35] there's power in the church of the
[1:43:36] living god
[1:43:38] and we understand that the enemy would
[1:43:40] intensify because he'll be mad when this
[1:43:42] bride leaves this place so we
[1:43:44] we understand what we are up against we
[1:43:46] understand the the role that the enemy
[1:43:48] has to play but we also understand our
[1:43:50] role
[1:43:51] and what we have to do as well so we
[1:43:52] want to approach the throne of grace
[1:43:54] this morning

[1:44:10] was identified and true scripture it

[1:48:47] at 8pm
[1:48:48] via zoom for our bible study uh this
[1:48:51] coming wednesday night

[1:48:55] that service at 8pm as well
[1:48:57] and this coming friday our zoom
[1:49:01] prayer meeting at 8pm as well
[1:49:04] let's make it our our priority let's
[1:49:07] make it our business
[1:49:08] and after the service maintenance team
[1:49:12] group five please uh metered by the
[1:49:15] black man after the service
[1:49:16] and next week uh group four which is
[1:49:19] about a marlins group
[1:49:21] uh is scheduled uh to clean
[1:49:24] and one final announcement we would have
[1:49:26] sent out uh
[1:49:28] some communication through but over with
[1:49:31] respect to
[1:49:32] our announcement last week uh brother
[1:49:34] felix
[1:49:35] would be here uh next sunday to
[1:49:37] represent voice of god
[1:49:39] um with respect to the agapo tablets and
[1:49:42] they
[1:49:43] quite simply don't have enough for
[1:49:44] everyone so we had to kind of work
[1:49:47] with brother felix to see what can be
[1:49:49] done
[1:49:50] and their whole purpose is to really uh
[1:49:54] be able to give these uh firstly and
[1:49:56] most importantly those who
[1:49:58] may not be able to afford to buy one so
[1:50:00] we have to kind of try to prioritize in
[1:50:02] that but they quite simply don't have
[1:50:03] enough for the island so
[1:50:05] we would be getting a portion of what we
[1:50:07] would have requested
[1:50:08] uh so brother will will if he has not
[1:50:12] already done so
[1:50:13] he will get a notification of it and uh
[1:50:15] they'll be here to
[1:50:16] distribute those uh next week uh sunday
[1:50:20] lord willing about an hour or so after
[1:50:22] the service uh they'll have a
[1:50:23] presentation
[1:50:24] as well and they'll also have some other
[1:50:26] material from voice of god
[1:50:28] uh as well here so even though you may
[1:50:31] not be collecting
[1:50:32] you are certainly welcome for the
[1:50:33] presentation they'll do a bit of a
[1:50:35] presentation to us as well
[1:50:37] so we encourage you even if you're not
[1:50:38] collecting you can stay for the
[1:50:40] presentation
[1:50:41] and certainly if you have been contacted
[1:50:44] uh about collecting you have to collect
[1:50:47] it in person
[1:50:48] they will not be giving it to anyone on
[1:50:50] your behalf
[1:50:51] so that is part of the way that this
[1:50:54] will be
[1:50:55] unfolding but anthony can you just
[1:51:00] thank you
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:05] i just want to leave you with one thing
[1:51:06] before we go
[1:51:08] you know we would have read this in uh
[1:51:11] proverbs
[1:51:12] 3 in one of our studies um
[1:51:16] a couple weeks about and it really
[1:51:18] struck me i said i will leave you with a
[1:51:20] with a scripture
[1:51:22] uh for this week and to kind of
[1:51:23] encourage you and it's proverbs
[1:51:26] 3 verse 5 it says trust in the lord
[1:51:29] with all thine heart and lead not
[1:51:32] until thine own understanding and i
[1:51:35] really want to strike in verse 6 we know
[1:51:37] it and i said the simplicity of it
[1:51:39] sometimes we we miss the simplicity of
[1:51:41] it it says in all thy ways acknowledge
[1:51:44] him
[1:51:45] and he shall direct thy path you know
[1:51:47] and i was thinking that
[1:51:48] in so many decisions we have to make in
[1:51:50] life we need direction
[1:51:53] you want to know that you're doing the
[1:51:55] right thing and that you're
[1:51:57] walking the right way and you're
[1:51:58] approaching things in the right way
[1:52:00] and the answer to the right way or the
[1:52:03] direction of your path
[1:52:04] is in a principle this is actually it's
[1:52:07] like a contract
[1:52:08] so he says in all thy ways acknowledge
[1:52:11] him
[1:52:12] and he shall direct that part so it's
[1:52:15] connected so
[1:52:16] once you do the acknowledgement the
[1:52:18] direction takes place
[1:52:20] and you know i was having a conversation
[1:52:22] around this one verse
[1:52:23] and and you know you would know how much
[1:52:25] how much passion i have around scripture
[1:52:28] and and it made me question how in how
[1:52:31] many ways do we actually
[1:52:32] acknowledge him you know and and we we
[1:52:35] do
[1:52:36] things and do we acknowledge him in our
[1:52:39] actions
[1:52:40] because he says in all thy ways
[1:52:42] acknowledge him
[1:52:44] so if there's a way an approach a thing
[1:52:47] you're doing that you're not
[1:52:48] acknowledging him
[1:52:49] then you are not activating his part of
[1:52:52] directing you
[1:52:53] so when you begin to acknowledge him so
[1:52:55] you're going down the road but you're
[1:52:57] acknowledging him
[1:52:58] on the way to try to go down the road
[1:53:00] because you want him to direct your path
[1:53:02] the moment you attempt to do anything
[1:53:04] without acknowledging him you are
[1:53:06] walking in your own pathway i want you
[1:53:07] to catch that
[1:53:08] but when you begin to acknowledge him so
[1:53:11] somebody said it to me so simply
[1:53:12] he said he was going into a meeting and
[1:53:14] he said lord i acknowledge you before i
[1:53:16] enter into this meeting
[1:53:17] it is simple yet powerful because you
[1:53:20] realize that nothing you could ever see
[1:53:22] will matter if you don't acknowledge him
[1:53:24] but if you acknowledge
[1:53:26] him in approaching it you have a meeting
[1:53:27] with somebody lord i acknowledge you
[1:53:29] before i make this phone call
[1:53:30] i acknowledge you before i drive the car
[1:53:33] i acknowledge you as i wake up this
[1:53:35] morning i acknowledge you because if it
[1:53:36] wasn't because of you i wouldn't wake up
[1:53:38] this morning
[1:53:39] this is different from prayer now this
[1:53:40] is you being as bad over speaking of
[1:53:42] that vertical
[1:53:43] connection because you want to
[1:53:45] acknowledge him and it and it's clear in
[1:53:47] all thy ways so there's no way that you
[1:53:50] should have where there is no
[1:53:51] acknowledgement
[1:53:52] there's nothing that you should do that
[1:53:54] you cannot acknowledge so it makes you
[1:53:56] also look at your ways
[1:53:58] because a way is is a way of action is a
[1:54:00] way of
[1:54:01] so if you can't acknowledge him and how
[1:54:03] you speak then you need to check how
[1:54:04] you're speaking if you can't acknowledge
[1:54:06] him and where you're going
[1:54:07] you need to check what you're doing
[1:54:09] anybody with me
[1:54:10] so i want to leave you with this
[1:54:11] scripture to meditate on this because
[1:54:13] your strength your success
[1:54:15] comes from meditating on this word day
[1:54:17] and night
[1:54:18] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[1:54:21] and lean not
[1:54:22] unto thine own understanding in all thy
[1:54:25] ways
[1:54:26] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:54:28] path
[1:54:29] may the lord richly bless you may you
[1:54:31] have a wonderful week
[1:54:32] may you have a blessed week may you have
[1:54:34] a victorious week may you have an
[1:54:36] overcoming week
[1:54:37] may you face your trials and face your
[1:54:40] fire
[1:54:40] and face everything with all the
[1:54:42] strength that god placed in your soul
[1:54:44] to be an overcomer he promised to never
[1:54:47] give you
[1:54:47] more than you could hear may the lord
[1:54:49] richly bless you
[1:54:51] but anthony
