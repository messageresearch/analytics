looking wonder strong you know struggling on your struggle i know you're struggling supposed to be struggling because you are jacob they're going to come to perfection your worms are going to be turned into a butterfly you're not a butterfly yet you're worm you're struggling up and down you don't know but that don't mean you're not gonna make it that difference a liar this morning not because you're struggling you're not gonna make it not because in your mind probably not gonna make it not because you're not gonna make it you're gonna make it feel the spirit inside of here please jesus christ just please um praise god just tell my wife and say no i love progress i love to see people achieve i love people to want to change i hate people who don't like challenges there's some people praying praying praying pray oh god and they can't follow instructions when they come out of the prayer and god bring a word for them they can't follow that but they pray oh jesus jesus said i'm coming to help you i'm sending a word for you i want the word come for you i can't do that i don't want to do that you we sing your prayers you say your own prayers locking up your blessing because all you've got to do is to obey and follow what god wants to give you that's all you got to do hallelujah you could paul you could scream you get nothing if after you come out of that you cannot follow simple instructions because the word come to give instructions and guidance and many times it's contrary to what you think what you feel how you feel is going to be like god love to raise the pressure [Applause] we can say some things here i can drop it on you i'm going to drop it on you but if i say when the press come now and the coaching or the press have to press half the breath have to press half the press they don't want to say amenities because they're hearing about the press not depressed when the press come down so therefore the press is very important in your life you don't even know how much that's important in life you leave people as they are in the comfort zone they do nothing they stay right there they are safe you see right now the budget is on one price the oil change and what not that is circumstances that train that cannot control the world cannot control that is external circumstances and that's what's gonna happen if love doesn't get you desperate external circumstances god going to force the issue my god i want to get out of here i want to get out of here i want to get out of here listen listen listen god listen jacob jacob to work on the tricks he was son of god called of god god spoke to him commission of god elect of god talk about jacob knight same skill downgrade tricky as ever but watch this god allow esau to be so dread that when jacob was told to go back home go back to your homeland go back go back to the word go back to where you come from go go back to your country go back to where you belong how many you feel like going back this morning we're saying back to the world yeah i said come to confront the scripture but i'm going to read it and sing and then we're going to start the scriptures here let me just get the script this is jacob and jacob said he's praying he knows they confront eso he send gifts split up his family send wife this way why this we companies we give up everything people under the family god strip him of everything no he have no family no i'm not here i'm not hearing him now i'm not hearing all the attachments he had to spit but he had to give up everything then give up his family and give up everything then jacob is all alone now all alone all alone you have no wife to lean on you have no children to comfort him you have no grandchildren running along his foot he has nothing like that he has no wealth to say oh i am somebody you know when somebody have nothing they ordinary they're happy they go lucky shake your hand when somebody gets something to change their clothing they're walking with the head up in the air like the air like it's very rare they get two pieces of something god don't like that god wants you to be as you are he wants somebody the more he blesses the more humble he becomes the more humble he stays god what that kind of heart he wanna bless you more and you already stopped up when god trying to push you already full up on yourself you can't even push any blessing outside of you because you already follow you if you get out to you this morning god gonna pour pour inside your house this very morning hey man you may be seated i'm about to finish this session here now and jacob said oh god of my father abraham this is jacob the rascal this is jacob this cult agreement this is jacob this camp this is jacob he's not changed yet [Applause] [Music] oh god of my father abraham god of my father isaac these eyes this genesis 32 9. the lord said unto me ah return unto thy country unto thy kindred and ideal deal well with thee this is worm jacob the worm this this is not the butterfly come on give the lord a shout inside of here this is not jacob the butterfly this is jacob the worm praying i am not worthy of the least of all thy mercy [Applause] no give the lord i shout you [Applause] i love that man i love that man he knows he's not worthy he's telling you listen i'm not worthy of the least of the messages for of all the truth without showed unto thy servant for with my staff i pass over this jordan and now i am two bands deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fail him least he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou sayers now he is talking to god and you say i will do the good i will make thy seed as the sun of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude oh bless the lord bless the word oh glory to god so when jacob locked god into that channel in which he said you said you want to bless me you said my seagull multiply and i'm scared as ever of easter my brother god deliver me [Music] [Applause] so jacob was caught alone angel came to him and jacob saw the way out he had to get rid of everything including the family circle to be alone with god all this comfort around him is gone now stripped how many are you feeling stripped oh yeah get stripped yet don't worry it's coming we're gonna read about it you're shipping coming i know you glad you're not stripped yet yet yet but you're coming everybody got to be stripped and and then when jacob felt all alone and and the angels started to wrestle with an angel he said i will not let you go till you bless me oh glory to god and god tested him on his own words it was a big fight going on with the pup realm jacob wrestling with the angel locking the angel neck rustling rolling down all night long it wasn't a five-minute wrestle it wasn't a 10 minute wrestle it was all night long until the end let me go let me go you're looking a little desperate let me go you look like you really want to be changed let me go because i'm not letting you go and you say let me go he said no come on see him that's what we're talking about [Music] you see and some of us not fed up enough we're not tired enough we're not wearing enough we're not moving off for transformation they're moving enough to be so desperate and say lord i'm not going to let you go till you change me i want to walk out here different and i came inside of here hallelujah and we know what happened the angel touched him and immediately he walked differently he couldn't walk with that proud arrogant look he woke humble he walked with a limp not that that was something caused that it changed it changed his walk and then god changed his name [Music] he didn't have the same name so if you have a new name and you have the same life something wrong gotta check back that name because when his life was changed his name was changed come on see him at somebody you can't have a name and your diaper change glory to god a changed life you have to get a new name upon that changed life and you you're gonna have a change of this morning let's all stand on the voice of the lord [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i know one more time jesus is the sweetest name i know jesus is the sweetest name i know i he's just the reason why i love him so for jesus so this time thank you musicians i want to talk to matthew chapter 17. we want to read from verse 10 to 12 acts chapter 3. we want to read from verse 19 to 21 first scripture reading this morning once again we want to say no registration required for website no password we're not going to give and take away anything we have relinquished that power to do that so people free to laugh criticize enjoy jump and shout and be blessed praise god matthew chapter 17 reading from verse 10 and the disciples asked him saying why then say describe that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not and have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them acts chapter 3 reading from verse 19. repent he therefore and be converted that your sins may be blooded out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive here we go until the times of the restitution of all things which is the restoration of all things which god had spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning and i pray that you will come into it speak to our hearts and lord don't leave us this way transform our lives to be more like you and jesus may ask it amen and amen before you take a seat just shake money hand and then take your seat tell them god bless oh praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord praise god thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah notice you're not saying god curse you you are saying god bless you that's what you're telling somebody god bless you may god bless him pour out upon you may god grace be upon your life don't judge anything before it's time let things work itself out don't be jumpy to judge don't be jumpy to condemn when you see jacob in an action don't just judge the man because god is speaking to that man because that man is elected that man is predestinated and have jacob preachers too elected and predestinated they ain't changed yet but they're gonna be is that jacob ellis and have jacob deacons and have jacob's sisters it have jacob brothers they haven't changed yet but they are gonna be because there is transforming power praise god you see a lot of people don't know what grace really is you don't know what grace really is if you understand what grace is you will be gracious so glory come on i'm not hearing you if you really understand what grace is you'll be gracious because when god grace come upon you you cannot condemn some others you cannot do that when god release you from your guilt from your past from your shame from your mistakes how could you lock somebody's neck to hold them accountable for what they did to you you are free this morning jesus said father forgive them as we forgive those father forgive us as we forgive those that trespass against us therefore you're going to have to have people that trespass him against you you can't say those shall not trespass somebody gonna trespass god going to allow them to trespass but you have to forgive them that your father forgive you and as you release them god release you if you don't release them you will stay in your prison you would come to church bong and you would walk out of here burn you would come back and say hong pong you will go on your japan but who the son of man set free [Music] free indeed how many wonderful free this morning how many feel the change falling off this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hold on you'll condemn your wife how long are you looking at your husband how long do you condemn your children how long you'll condemn the boss the neighbor how long you want to find fault stop it cut it out sit down a minute praise god [Music] [Applause] i don't like excuses and i don't like blame i don't blame anybody for anything i take responsibility when you're blaming you're looking for an excuse looking for a way of not me is because it's because it's because it's not because you choose your action you choose your decision i choose to serve the living god i can't blame it with this and that no i choose to get baptized in jesus name my mother didn't force me go get baptized son god serve the lord's son no i choose [Applause] that when they get away from blame when they get out of that system you have no education you're still blaming no education because you don't have to stay like that don't want to see him and that's it still doesn't change the truth if you can read you can learn to read it's what ambition you have if you can write you could learn to write if you cast so you can learn to show if you can't clean you can learn to clean if you can't paint you can learn to paint if you can't jump you can learn to jump if you can't run you can learn to run and if you've never praised god before we will show you if you never join the heavenly chorus we will show you how to join the hurriedly chorus hold the beast at amen and the four and twenty elders said hallelujah they just wasn't shaking their heads come on we want freedom in this place stop quacking like a chicken and saw like an eagle come on sam as somebody hallelujah i wonder if you're healthy amen not amen no i hate you man [Applause] is restoration of all things that's my title this morning restoration of all things and my inspiration is back to the bible back to the word and i'm dead serious on that one because you have to go back to the bible you have to read the scriptures you have to get back in the bible you see this book is sealed and what the prophet came to do was to unseal it that we could know what is it a lot of people can say what i'm saying but they don't know what the bible say so they can't tie it back into the bible but we have to be able to take the scriptures and tie back into what god said here then it becomes alive then it becomes quicken then it becomes scripture i think brother george tell me that brother branham said jesus believe a drunk man it was that brother george but jesus believe a backseat and preacher who he's talking about david david said i i shall not see my suffer my holy one to seek corruption or see leave a soul in hell david said that i'm calling and jesus believed that word because that word was god forget that brexit and preacher forget that but when that man moving the spirit and spoke by your spirit that was not the man come on get lord come on now come on now when the spirit of god came upon that man you cannot touch what's coming out out here when that voice of god rose out hallelujah okay praise god bro praise god but abandon said no doubt march of the lamb your lovely pastor's approach the subject many times and i know that there's going to be a bride and that there's going to be a wedding supper silver in the sky just as sure as god is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they're going to have listen watch ha here we go are you ready and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready they have the material here on it now to make themselves ready because the battery said his wife had made herself ready here we go notice it said she has made us afraid so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lion or stealing i'll save him but that's up to you [Music] you have got something too didn't overcome shall inherit all things did it overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready i like that word you see god here we go could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other side and then say blessed is he that overcome it god cannot push you through the pipe and then come around and pull you out and say blessed is he that overcome it no his blessings he that pull it that does not overcome it now watch you had nothing to overcome he just pulled you through but you have got to make decisions for yourself listen but i had to make a decision for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to god when it dropped on what did the voice said because that was chosen you have walked in your own chosen you have picked the precise and correct decision it is my way it is the harder way it is the narrow way oh glory to god because of this decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee what a wonderful glorious decision that has made this in itself is what will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine at the end of staying with the word god will show you a continuation of the word and god will confirm the word to your life oh glory are you with me but abraham saw recognizing his message the seven angel message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the enlivened our gentiles to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got and jesus taught it he said there were some people went into the harvest they were hired and when they did early morning receive a penny for the day noon time came and work and then at the 11th hour last all the day someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they did at the first hour of the day so it's perfectly the first all messengers with the word with the gospel the truth they came into their pentecost there was a dark age blocked them out then at the middle of the day luther wesley then there's to be an even time message to receive the same thing they did at the beginning this is very important not a new thing but the same thing here we go the even time message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing notice the scripture we read the disciples of john came to jesus and said why say the scribe these disciples came out disciples of jesus why say the scribes elias must first come the answer jesus said elias must first truly come and restore all things he's talking about malachi 4. but elias had already come and did what he's supposed to do he's talked much on the baptist same spirit of elijah but the first thing he said elias shall fully come first come and restore all things that means we have to see a restoration of the holy ghost back in the church a restoration of signs wanders back into the church i'm not talking about william branham now he had that because he was restored back to adam before the fall oh give the devil a shout out to pray brother branham was a full demonstration of a son before the fall that's why he could say before the doctors and touches my wife the tumor will go down the treatment goes down little fishy i give you back your life he was demonstrating apostolic authority and apostolic power and he said what you see gonna have more of it when the stress of the press come down come on now praise god hallelujah you are ready for that yet we are not ready for that yet because we have to get the test of the word i'm not hearing you you ride with me don't just watch what i'm saying i'm i'm speaking the word to you [Applause] i'm not talking about tests by your family just but no the test of the word when jesus got the holy ghost he was led to be tested alone here bring his elders and bring out possibility there we go in wilderness we are the group [Music] [Applause] jesus is another group of ministers with him let us go let us go into the wilderness and then they can lay hands upon one of every list and come from another hold on my brother who keep on pressing on my brother that's what we want some of us we want the people around us we have to have somebody to talk to yeah but better to talk to god more now after they say this you better have somebody to talk to because god is about to strip you watch all the images disappear now did not believe it but you have to get straight before you come into power ah you can't go into power as you are god has to clean you up joseph i dare you to shave them up look look look at joseph vision vision i mean nothing vision is to come to pass i have a vision that's nice amen every time they come to the pulpit vision you're talking about we'll plan for him we'll cut him off we got pulley connection but all right we could take our username and password all right they take joseph sell him out to egypt amen bring back a cloth kill animal put blood in it and bring him back to the father oh god my son dead if joseph you're talking about he's my special son did your son years whether you have that small grief doesn't balance oh it matters joseph griezmann too pain on both sides pain further aside the brothers that's good we can't we no more vision we're here not preaching again amen what what happened what is the drama behind our whole story joseph grow past his pain as you will grow past your pain joseph uh he ended up getting a job as a gardener he get promoted that promotion caused trouble sometime promotion discussed trouble he ended up in prison and then he still have vision he cast up the gift you know you could lock it up it's still working you could put it in prison it's still operating come on give the lord a shout prison doesn't stop the gift and people putting you in a prison of their mouths and lies doesn't stop the gift watch joseph saw the buckle on the baker he said one you want to act take away you go out to the world you're in trouble you lose your head tomorrow you with that wine you'll be promoted back to your position as butler when you got up there remember me don't forget me now i remember any man gave me vision right look look let me call god when you're catching the power call me back when that butler hit that atmosphere and whoa he showed that god in the corner yesterday he ain't talking to nobody free now he ain't talking to anybody he's free hallelujah what god is doing god is putting heat god is forcing the issue of character god is forcing the issue of abandonment that's what we need an abandonment to god that's how it was in the early days you know whatever you're fast you pray you're seeking god by yourself you're asking god in the bush people are going to push and pray i'm not here these young people don't know nothing about that they don't they don't know nothing about that they know nothing about that seeking god you have a right not to say amen for that you don't know what i'm talking about but say amen no because you're gonna know what i'm talking about you're gonna know what i'm taught because you're gonna have listen if jacob had to cry what about you jacob and cry out jacob to repent jacob and the lord afraid me brother deliver me and if you want to sit there pump us as ever as if you're all right because you've got some money in your pocket shame on you you better begin to cry out because what is about to come you can't stop you've got to have the power to withstand what's coming one of these days this whole church game going to be over this coming to church and graham hawk home that's going to be over one of these days that will be different altogether hallelujah because the prophet saw a press coming the prophet saw a force coming he called it a national force i'm not preaching in vain i'm not talking these promises and then it's real and it's true [Applause] [Music] to be cleaned up stripped he felt abandoned he along with his dreams along with his vision and guess what he can't bring it to pass one time brother behind a dream a vision a vision of a child being healed he went to the home and an old lady was there cleaning her glasses he brought the child to be prayed for which i was healed the old lady was not there he sent for the child he prayed for the child the child got worse the child got sick then brother banham said he went ahead of the vision it was a painful experience the child in a worse condition he knew the child supposed to heal but everything is not right he had to wait whole night long until the next morning next morning here come the old lady granny coming he can't tell she went to put on the glasses no she had to put on the glasses my inspiration he can't set nothing you have to wait until the vision is right then he can make his move god has brought a seven seal seven thunder vision you have to wait until the vision is just right that's why i say wait till them seven times after the voices of that group we have to wait until it turns right and when it's just right we can make a move to have a seven thunder revival which we gonna have in trinidad oh give the lord a shout to pray which we gonna have in trinidad [Music] [Applause] god has to heal that child now everything is in position and that's what we are here for to get into position that we can say bring that chap bring the cripples now bring the blame bring the death bring the hulk oh get the lord some praises people oh glory to god why because everything is in position [Applause] i want you to begin to read your bible there's going to be acts 2. not really a pentecost as it was not all part they're going to be acts 4 acts 5 and nasa's a firearm there's going to be the power of god emanating in the church of the living god do you believe that this morning a real church not what we see now buildings caretakers elders and deacons we were pretending posing taking pictures impersonating amen all kind of characters fronting themselves as somebody saying everybody wordy no everybody doing their own thing and so forth nobody waiting for god to pull them aside amen says god if you stay with the world god will take you aside and give you something come on not pull you aside to pull you aside where is he his aside he didn't say that pull you aside and give you something afterwards after being tested after sanctification after behavior after see if he could take the test he could take your wife from you he could take the child from you he could take the anointing off of you he could turn the church against you he could turn your husband against you he could turn your wife against you after the test i'm not hearing you this is the gospel this is the word this is the message and this is what brother branham came to restore you see here what's going on here what happened we just come to the church ages luther wesley church cathedral big way called then pipe organs cross amen stained glass windows breeze tore caps long guns rituals barbells oh what kind of smoking all kind of simi stuff that's church when people see the prison action like that they're feeling holy holy holy they're feeling like that area and all all over again that is church afterwards they care the confession say to all father three holy mary and you're fine they love that priest that priests like god just do them that now if he is god he is but the god we serve back to the eye of god the word that's not fine you need to repent you need to come to the cross you need to get baptized to be identified with his death bearing resurrection you need to be washed in order to be made whole that's what you need that's why you come and i want to tell you as you are going to get baptized in water you have to get battered with fire so none of you here should be content or satisfied just coming here in the world hearing the world hearing the word hearing the word no you must want to see the word live you must want the word to become flesh umbrella among us [Music] we're talking about jesus the word made flesh amen and if the word is made flesh the word will take you out the word will fellowship with you the word will even make a cake for you as it was the word will minister to you because the word has become flesh and when the word becomes flesh your wife gonna see it feel it know it touch it come on now your husband gonna see it know it jesus jesus just seemed to have god's mind for every situation every situation he just seemed to have the mind of god my god they saw a man crippled and he know what they're thinking you know what they're thinking he said i shouldn't be forgiving thee they can't be a grumble grumble only god could forgive sins only god forgives sins you say which one is easier so it says i send me oh thicker than walk he's like a dog boat right now i have no one want to see the other one he said pick a bed and walk and the man pick up his bed and walk and all they can do is talk but that man have a walk could lord have mercy on feeling the preachment when those are just talking we're going to be walking we're going to be working as our father work we work also give the lord a shout out praise god always always forces the issue when the time comes he just forced the issue mary was pregnant but she wasn't in position to make the messiah god had to force the issue by asking for taxation where everybody come back to the hong kong so mary had to drift down to bethlehem to bring jesus because the bible prophesied jesus to be born in the hopes of god's bread in bethlehem so mary had to be forced come on now come on now come on now my you're going to have that baby hey thank you i'm not hearing you this morning no like temperance patience godliness mary you're gonna have that baby [Applause] know what something if somebody said mary don't go back liam i have a nice pink decorated room with quilted bed for you to see have that baby on that i say that that's lucifer in all his glory trying to break

spoke to me be eternal look on your word lord of facts thanks thank we got to be sensitive we got to be willing to try to get the mind of the spirit the answer is no no no no no room in the end and then one in me i have a man behind there that's the only room mary said time up i'll take that yes because he's he's the lamb i'm here to be born in a manger not in the end oh hallelujah so in that environment god go in and rumble out god going and tumble out jesus go about the comfort shepherds in the watching the flocks by night angels sang to them and said come this way them shepherds are going to no end and say if anybody in the inn what room are they in no you're not they're coming in they're going to ban like leave them to ban shepherds stinking shepherds looking like sheep not big shots no hallelujah real shepherds they know that that's a mystery you know why it had to be shepherds why it had to be shepherds what is that saying to you in the last days they're going to come for genuine true shepherds they're going to love the sheep that will fight for the sheep yeah that will serve the sheep that would see them feed the sheep [Applause] hallelujah genuine shepherds you mean call gonna restore that yes real man of god hallelujah you mean peter like andrew and all them yes glory to god you gotta be careful how you see people that's right how you view people people have to record them they put it on facebook amen [Music] they print it they talk about it they tweet it but that man gonna be converted i hope they put that on facebook too come on say hey man somebody don't just put negative put the positive also [Applause] because that same man that denied christ that same and that curse was the front man to say these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that that the prophet you see we have to go back to the world we have to be able to identify the manifestation back into the scripture jesus i want to find the place where it is written they say the spirit is upon me we have to go back to the scripture and the bride have to fight the scriptures could somebody say amen your scripture is not church member [Applause] sit down say in a minute you see people want to believe this message and don't go to the word is that possible yes you can believe the message of the doctrine as a teaching as a belief that is right but for you that go to the word means that you are applying the word to your life and wherever the sword falls it falls in other words you are not doing something because somebody else is doing it you ask what does the word say well this pastor allowing this or this pastor doing that and we should do it too no what does the word see so your measurement is not another church your measurement is not another group we have no mecca the muslim has mecca mecca is where the journey too that is their oh holy holy place we have a headquarters today see where going that brother until we're going but branham he says we cannot all come into one organization we cannot do that this little organization i think god been in it the whole thing but we are different each man sees different each person sees different no two minds is exactly the same no two people is the same known two noses no two thumb prints being made different and that way we should have different groups i want to hear a bigger image than that so we can be fighting for one group the group he doesn't have that watch god always works with an individual he don't save you because your methodist he doesn't save you because you're baptist he doesn't save you because your pentecostals he saves you because he has dealt personally with you and you are saved on that basis that you have accepted it so therefore god could deal with you he doesn't deal with you in the order of his church he deals with you as an individual therefore when god sent forth his prophets his messengers of the testament he spoke to one man and that man had to bring the message others went from him everywhere bringing the same message or supposed to bring us a message but there had to be one headquarters [Music] god has always had it i'm thankful he's got it tonight that's the holy ghost not some group but the holy spirit is god's headquarters that is god's messenger of the hour i want to hear how big i am so we have a headquarters this morning and we are connected to it so any group any church anyway want to be mecca for the bride that's that doesn't make sense they on their own somebody said the journey to that not me not us not the bride we have one headquarters could we say do you know the headquarters it's the holy ghost the holy ghost is god's headquarters and if the holy ghost anoint brother anthony you're hearing from the headquarters if the holy ghost i'm going but isaac you're hearing from the headquarters and if the holy ghost are not your pastor you are hearing from headquarters i say this morning you are hearing from headquarters because there's going to be a restoration of all things i am going to be your god he said i will wipe away your eye cares [Applause] how much inner pain is in the heart of people that people don't know some minutes i could write that away come to every tears from your eyes do we really know the people's hurts people fears people in a pain what they struggle with and suffer with you don't have a clue you see a bunch of weaklings a bunch of struggler people need it [Music] but lord have mercy we like to boss how strong we are yeah we like to talk about david samson josiah we hardly talk about jacob amen because jacob speaks a lot about us who preached about jacob jacob great drop affection i have to perfection no perfection or we don't even understand how revolutionary because to me if you get grace to your life it must show extending to others you cannot have a genuine revelation of god's grace and really really take it on somebody else because grace means god's blood come into your life grace means god listen but iran dramatize it he talk about a man who killed a king's son became only son not a seventh or sixth or fourth looking at one son amen the man the king came to see the man who killed his son came to the prison why have you killed my son my only son and the man very repentant so i didn't mean to do it i got in that temper and i i acted and whatnot and the man said no today you are going to be my son the king took his robe put it on that man and that man that was a condemned prisoner walk out as the king's son that is grace i'm not hearing you maybe some of you up somewhere but that is grace now this is what god wants us to extend to others you have to have more patience come on hallelujah patient like god hallelujah yes we have to have more patience yeah these are fast age fast foods everything we want now but patience must have its perfect work patience problems is perfection is waiting on god and waiting for god you're waiting you're not waiting you're struggling you're waiting you god is silent but you're still waiting you're not backsliding waiting you're holding on waiting under signification you're waiting because god gave you a promise you're waiting [Applause] jacob because he was a son he had the ability to hear from god that is tremendous he has not changed yet but he could hear from god that's why he told god you told me to go back home you told me to go back to the word back to the bible and i am struggling but i'm going back hallelujah i'm fierce but i'm going back i have challenges but i'm going back [Music] and i trust that god put upon you a burden to get back to your first love get back to our abandonment to god where you free yourself from the world and the things of the world and the environment and say god i really need you i need a breakthrough and need an infilling of your spirit i need an empowerment [Applause] not just in church but could take me to my job take me to my home i want to take it to the enemy come on now i want to take it to the camp of the enemy i want to be so empowered that i'm empowered to take it back to the enemy take it to the camp of the enemy oh hallelujah look at the lord and shout the prayers for glory to god we get an insight into battle inside into spiritual warfare that you can have the victory and overcome because god wants a bunch of overcomers there's going to be i don't care how much hell is on the earth i look at my demons i'm on sex spirit how much lost demons i don't care what is on the earth god has predestinated god has elected that people to stand and overcome in this last day we were born and raised up come on you mothers you are born and raise up come on you fathers you were born and raised up come on your husband you wish you were born and raised up [Applause] the worst thing is to have no ambition brother man i'm sorry man how are you going nowhere here and there hallelujah where are you going to anywhere my son head rest hallelujah but no don't know what the next day looking like trusting for the next day no purpose in life when you wake up in the morning wake up dull because i don't know what the more going to bring not waking up like you're going to make tomorrow you're going to make your day you wake up and say today is going to be a great day how do you know because i said it and i'm going to make it [Applause] man walk in the room i said it's a beautiful room there's somebody college harbor you say but i make it beautiful praise god you could make listen get the devil so confused when the devil expects you to be done out depressed put your tail between your leg and running you put your tail back up and you walk let the devil see you are walking you are walking measured steps every place you put your foot it's yours you let the devil know your steps are measured your steps are ordered my steps are ordered the steps of the righteous i ordered of the lord oh jesus oh jesus hallelujah give the lord a shout you may be seated open bibles the first kings chapter 18. let's find that scripture first king chapter 18 let me get on in the scriptures back to the bible first kings chapter 18 hallelujah we want to read from verse 17. first kings chapter 18 reading from verse 17 we read and it came to pass when aof saw elijah that ahab said unto him i thought he the trouble at israel are you the troubleman and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and my father's house in that had forsaken the commandments of the lord and that was followed balaam now therefore sin and gather to me all israel onto monkana and the prophets of beia 450 and the prophets of the grove 400 so there's 850 prophets all together which eats at jezebel stable hallelujah you see where the prophet eating from so ahab sent unto all the children israel guided the prophets together unto monkana and elijah came unto all the people and said how long shall you halt between two opinions if the lord be god follow him and if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word there was silence then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal prophets are 450 men there's a huge comparison there let them therefore give us two bullets let them choose one bullock for themselves cut it in pieces lay it on wood put no fire under and i will dress the other block lay it on wood and put no fire under and call me on the name of your gods and i will call in the name of the lord under god that answer it by fire let him be god then the people don't get loose and all the people answered it is well spoken and elijah said unto the prophets of their choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call in the name of your gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given him they dressed it calling the name of baal from morning even until noon saying obey i'll hear us but there was no voice no any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made it came to pass at noon elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or perventing his sleeper and must be waking and they cry a lot cut themselves after the manner with knives landsat fell blood got shot among them and it came to pass when mayday was passed they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice no any to answer not anything regarded and elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people came near to him here we go this is the part i want to get to and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down keep the pages right there we're not finished the first thing elijah did was to repair the altar repair it in your home repair it in your house repair it in your life repair the altar of god the place where you pray husband and wife the praise where you pray father sons and children or whatever the place where you pray repair it and bring it back bring it back in the house repair restore the altar of god back into the home back into the church we have on a parameter on tuesday we're going to repair we're going to bring back the offering up unto god incense going up unto god are you with me and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom he the word of lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench above the altar as great as can contain two measures of seed he put here we go the wood in order he didn't destroy the word on the altar he put it in order and that's why the church must be set in order that's why your life have to come into order there must be an order isn't that right he cut the bullock in pieces laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood he said do it a second time they did it the second time he said do it the time and they did it at a time and the water ran about the altar he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evil sacrifice elijah the prophet came there and said listen to this prayer lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel that i am thy servant and that listen i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god here we go and that doors turn their heart back again keep your fingers right there the elijah spirit is to restore and turn the hearts back to god and this is what he's praying here now watch then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust lick up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the kishon and slew them there may god bless the reason of his word before the fire fell before the fire fell the altar had was to be repaired the old heart was to be restored prey had to be offered for the guarded answer by fire let him be god and before the fire of dynamics falls there got to be a restoration of all things a restoration of the prayer altar back in the church a restoration of sign and crying and travailing and groaning for the holy ghost there's got to be a restoration because the opening of the word is supposed to bring us back to the bible the opening of the mysteries it's supposed to bring the people back to the world but abraham said this moses was the word in that day because the word was given to him for that day mo joseph was the word in that day put you in christ each one of them was the word here we go are you ready but when jesus came he was the word in its fullness because the whole plan of redemption laid in him the whole plan of redemption didn't lay in moses did elaine joseph delaney elijah they were part of the word pointing to it notice keep your thought here it comes as i see it the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it therefore after him the fullness here we go we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word so when the fullness come we can't point this on man we can point to some group we have got to point to the headstone himself the capstone of divine love even jesus christ so everybody pointed out man or group is false it's off the word it has to be back to christ the fullness because you have to be brought into the measure of the fullness of the statue of christ which means you get your measure of this stature this is the fullness but you get a measure of that fullness in your life oh hallelujah glory to god so therefore the fightful ministry will take the bride back to the word back to the bible isn't that right because the bible brings on the fullness of the atonement that's what came to bring the fullness of the blood understand this the altar is where judgment strikes and because the altar has blood on it it becomes a mercy seat he said the altar was there in a gardener eden that's where king and abel come to worship he said the way back to even this by the altar and through the altar you have to come back to the altar the author is where the sacrifices approve where your life has come on the altar stripped of ambition stripped of will stripped of pride stripped of who you think you are and you say god consume the sacrifice [Applause] remember we talk about three things last sunday hallelujah three things to make fire and we talk about the word we talk about worship are we talking about signification it must have those three ingredients must be a sanctified bunch some part of this earth god going to bring a sanctified bunch true you have to be sanctified by the word god has to clean you up wash them by the washing of the water by the word and with that you come worshiping praising god oh hallelujah i i don't want to be caught in cotton coating he said the mysteries is to bring you to a spot where you have to where you could behave yourself that's what it's for nothing to go and say you have mysteries you have knowledge because paul handled that do i know all mysteries do i have all knowledge and i don't have the love of god i am not sort nothing zero neither paul hadn't let already do i have fear to move mountains nothing still [Applause] [Music] the miracles jesus they didn't do it no it was the cross that did it the power was in the cross that's why you went down the hill that's right that way you brought the resurrection he raised the dead do you think they said tank can reason they're dead come come does jesus no look home and live but abraham lived the life of christ manifest christ do some miracles and the pentecostal here to the man rejected him they still push him aside they was impressed with the miracles but that doesn't stop how they go but guess what he said the message going to get in the heart of the predestinated some of us wasn't even born yet some of us wasn't wrong but he knew by vision this word can return void god circle the earth with this message and god has to find you in trinidad look where you come from look how far you come from i don't care if it was in the bush somewhere god i could find you if your name is on that book and pull you out god couldn't let you born in some big rich family god that you're born under poverty god let you born in the struggle god that you're born wherever to make sure you get in position to hear the message this is the greatest thing you could hear this is the last message this is the final message this is a message from the angel glory glory you might be seated i'm a prophecy brahman said just say the lord russia have a bomb for the vatican it's already built it's already here nuclear bombs are going to be used the world is heading for war i don't want to be part of that it's going to affect the entire world we can't say we're in trinidad and we are immune from it the bible says every island will be flooded away and the eyes are small thing in god so if you figure you want an island here everything is safe and nice and dandy look at the prime minister the budget was the 80 dollars look at the price of oil now she can say don't let the price fall she's not controlling that and i'm telling you certain things we won't be able to control oh hallelujah did you hear that did you really hear that when the powers had to come we can't control healing the sick we can't control cast not that we can't this this have to happen we can't control open the eyes of the blind blank but a brand of daughter died with cross eyes his baby daughter and after that he never prayed for cross-eyed children you know what he used to do just watch them and straight knuckle their eyes he had such a thing i guess that he didn't have to pray watch them across and just watch them and straighten out the eyes that our faith could do it oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes faith could move mountains [Applause] all things are possible to them that believe fear could praise the dead fear could melt your cancer melt your tumor melt your condition fears could revive you heal you what what one time somebody was dying of climbing what was that deterioration contagious thing they said they were all like a priest because priest is not married and the deteriorate or something like that and the parents say well this this man is like our priest and but abandonment went in the room and said lord jesus challenges him amen walk back out not the lord you know how it is you know not that long kind of drama business just just going inside the deer and say heal in jesus name and get back out and the parents had to rejoice hallelujah hallelujah child is here hallelujah the doctors say the instrument showing the girl dying she said she said you're looking at your instrument i look at what god say the instrument saying dying dying going undead instrument talking that talk which is i'm not looking at that no if you're working in cement your heart melts going down down dying but she's not looking at those signals she's a man of god just prayed man of god just prayed man of god just prayed what about him said they're gonna stop diseases they're gonna stop cancer they're gonna stop sacrifice come on now come on now we're not talking about talking about it we talking about action read the bible read the bible read the bible go back to the word you may be seated you read a book on mark you only seen action words jesus healed the sick cast our devils do this do this only action not just information not just revelation you see we have to go to the revelation stage we have to go to the unfolding of the word stage but when that is over the teaching of the word time is over then it'll come the time of refreshing hope sent by god or jesus must receive the heaven must receive jesus until the restitution of all things so jesus jerome have to stay up there until everything be restored until the church is restored and we have a scripture from joel i will restore all with the conquer woman the caterpillar and the pomegranate so the scriptures itself is lining up to restore back the church to its former glory the church had a glory that glory was over the church when peter walked people were healed and peter's shadow it wasn't peter's shadow it was the shadow of god peter had a light in him that light was showing a shadow and when you walk under that shadow you have to be healed when paul touch you touch them and you'll get healed come on now they're quick and power oh i'm telling you some of you need that inside of here some of you are dead inside of here you need quick number but there's a promise for you of the quickening power oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so friends we have to go back to the word you have to go back to the bible isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord but abraham said to the lutheran age they just shall live by faith the outer court along came the methodist age signification age they call it the second definite work of grace which come in that age watch and now there's that's the alter age i like that that's the groaning that's the train that is travailing you see sanctification is what you do god has not come to come and clean up your house no angel coming to sweep no broom in your house you will clean up your house you will cut the grass around your yard you will cut the grass in your heart and you will clean up your life you will do it say after me i will do it say i've got to do it i will do it see i've got to do it give the lord a shout out so the altar age it's a signification age it's the travailing age once we're waiting in the spirit we waiting on a signification because the name is coming hallelujah now i can say dynamic issue and it is here it isn't here in the form of promise brother branham had that promise amen but identify his dynamics as the spirit of prophecy because dynamics is spirit but if the spirit is not here for power and demonstration it can only be here as prophecy which has taken the same word and prophesying it that's what we have to do from version 10 8-11 we have us to take from the prophet and prophesy back to the people because we don't have our own message that's why i bring the quotes that you will know i'm saying what the tapes say and i'm inspired saying it and god is anointing it so there is no mystic i'm trying to say this i'm trying to say that i'm not trying to say anything but what the tips say come on give the lord some praise as people oh hallelujah you see i know god only confirmed his word not an interpretation of it i understand that years ago that is why i started to stay and see even if i'm preaching free i know i'm preaching what the prophet said my brother and i say come and tell him i said something and he was sketching to find it i was happy he did that afterwards he found it because he never heard it before so even though you see i'm preaching free i'm not preaching my own thoughts you could find it back in the prophet's word years ago i promised to do that we're not preaching if i'm not coaching i'm still saying what the prophet said oh hallelujah but i'm saying it three i'm saying what the tapes say i purpose that i'll do that not try to interpret it means so it means so the ten vision and this and that and twisty and twisty and try to figure it out i'm gonna figure out anything if god said it it have to come to pass god said it's gonna be revival it got to come to pass god said you will be formed to the word image it's got to come to pass you have to be formed in a world image before you're going to rapture you are not in the word image right now because your choices were going to do that and some of you are ready for that yet some of you just got a little test and you want to ball and give up hallelujah you have to go through [Music] let's call it the willingness you hear that only 10 amen let's call it the wilderness the bible said i passed them through it had a shortcut to god you know but gotten me a long way to hoping hoping that the heart gave up on egypt notice when they tried to come let us go back to egypt that's what afraid of every time something go you have a rock back it's like you have a man in the closet if you guys want to get trouble yeah go right back to that man close today he said kill him kill him kill him kill him kill him kill your first husband bury him i hope nobody handle man in the closet bury him that first husband that first flesh kill him so you have nothing that's why when the those armies was fighting and whatnot the first thing to do is what blow up the bridge no turning back these al qaeda people who get radicalized them going one way you know they may hope in the commotion are they going straight to paradise that's how they're thinking look at how some people get radicalized in this message with hate and envy and malice and water they radicalize it look like they live take a back backseat is what you're taught now what you teach it you become indoctrinating or you're teaching you're fighting for the teaching i felt every teacher have no life in it i asked myself a question how would barbara live how did he handle his stuff oh my i want to get some stories for you of how brother branham acted and lived and so on oh hallelujah oh glory to god i was reading about the 300 pokemon brahma's written 118 points at that time or so and that man walked up to the platform and he come up to the platform see a snake in the grass spit on brother branham i'm going to the beach up and over there the police went holy man and that man was some a man from some insane institution beating the preachers and when the police come and burns it's not a flesh and blood affair this is a spiritual warfare going on here hallelujah is that blessed by the fear by telling me what's the man's eyes look up and see man you know brown was a short guy yeah i look up and see the man we fighting now i'm not fighting now what whatever run straight out without the power what i'm standing to get knocked down you better know the eye powered you so wait no you really think i stand up there look at him and watch me guys friends i confess that i was running for my life see that's embarrassing you're the preacher is that right you come and stand up you show me how to do it but the brandon was dependent upon the angel afterwards a present holy spirit come down angel there all the fear gone and then out of his mouth come because you challenge the spirit of god you shall fall over my feet for a long day no over my feet the man coming closer and when he raised up and said come out of him the man spin around and fall over on the feet that'll pull the man over the brown the police asked brother branham is he dead he said no is he all right he said no he said he worshipped that spirit if he gives up that spirit it would leave him but he worshipped that spirit what spirit are you worshiping because if you're giving up he's going to leave you come on give the lord some praise people come on give the lord some praise these people hallelujah hallelujah there are certain things you've got to give up and then
