Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Forget about your trials. Forget about your testings. Forget about your problems. He is God all by himself. Hallelujah. He woke us up this morning. We have a reason to shout. We have a reason to worship. We have a reason to say thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning? My my my my. You may be seated for a few minutes. Certainly want to greet you this morning in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And it's certainly a great privilege to be able to be in the house of God one more time. It's not something we ever take for granted. We know that the prophet taught us one day we'll have the last service. One day we'll preach the last message. But until that come that time comes, we want to do all that we can do for the glory of God. We want to redeem the time and put our shoulders to the wheel in this great season that we're living in. Knowing that time is short and we have a responsibility as the prophet taught us. He said, "What we see should put our souls into action to make a church that would make a revival." And I believe that we are part of that great vision that the prophet saw of a church coming into view, coming into step, and coming into a realization of who they are and more importantly who's they are. You didn't call yourself, you didn't choose yourself. God called you. And that is enough of a reason to shout because if you chose yourself, then you could let yourself go. But if God chose you, he is built a certain way. He's not going to let you go. He's not going to lose one. Hallelujah. God is not in the random picking business. God is not now deciding this morning to call you. You were called before there was a moon, before there was a molecule, before there was a star, before there was anything. Your name was put there and by his fornowledge, he could predestinate you to come to adoption, to come to perfection, and to live a life above sin, live a life above condemnation, live a life with a revelation that you are part of the vision of God. Can the church say amen? So, we are happy this morning. coming. You appreciate the service last night yesterday with our precious brother Jonathan Martin. God bless you, brother Jonathan. May God bless you richly and we are under great expectation for what God is about to do. We do want to acknowledge our precious brother Tim Redhead who's in the house this morning from Grenada. Brother Tim, God bless you from Grenada. And we were so blessed to have him minister last Wednesday night for us. And we want to let you know that God has more in store for us. He came to Trinidad to rest. And as the elder said, you have to labor to enter into that rest. So he has to labor even while he's here. So this coming Wednesday, it's a public holiday. So we're going to move the service a little earlier to 5:00 p.m. And he will labor to enter into his vocation. So he will be ministering on Wednesday by the grace of God. And this coming Sunday ahead of us, he will also be ministering to us. So his rest will be a well-deserved rest after having labored to enter into that rest. But brother Tim, God bless you. We appreciate you being here with us. Amen. By the grace of God. And we are excited to see what God is doing. You see, because I believe we have the devil on the ropes. &gt;&gt; And when you have the enemy on the ropes, you got to keep punching. We're not going to let him even get his head up. Because before we leave here, I always believe the bride isn't going to leave here saying we barely made it. We're going to leave here with our foot on the devil's neck. We're going to leave here pulling our children from the enemy. We're going to leave here and throw cancer back in the devil's face. Devil, take your arthritis. Take your high blood pressure. Take your doubt and unbelief. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. And we know who we are. We know where we come from and we know where we going. Can the church say amen? Glory. So, we have a preacher this morning, a mighty gift of God, and we are under great expectation. We have two services today, this service, and at 400 p.m. By the grace of God, we are looking to leave this place with a shout. Brother Jonathan came as a sign of a quick short message. He is going from church tonight to the airport. &gt;&gt; So, he's just here on a mission. And God sent a special Navy Seal operator, dropped him behind enemy lines, &gt;&gt; and he's going to soon the mission is over. He heads straight to the airport. Before the enemy look for him, he's already gone because that's the season we live in. But I believe that today some sons are going to go free. Some daughters are going to go free. Some sons are going to catch a revelation that this message is just as real as it was. That the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is just as real as it was. It's the same Holy Ghost. It's the same power. It's just as real then as it is is now. And God is going to raise up a mighty marching army. And by the grace of God this evening, we expect believers from the other churches to join us. So we are under great expectation for the move of God. Can the church say amen? So can we stand to our feet as we welcome God's servant to the platform? He wanted that song in the morning when I rise. Give me Jesus. In the morning when I rise in the morning. [Music] In the morning. Give me brother Jonathan. [Music] Jesus, [Music] you can have all this world. Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Give me Jesus in the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise, give me Jesus. Oh, give me Jes. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. One more time. Give me Jesus. I've got to have Jesus. Give me Jesus. Jesus, you can have all this world. Sing that again. You can have [Music] You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. [Music] Oh, that's what we're after. That's who we want more than anything the world could offer us. Satan can offer the kingdoms of this world. He still is in control. He's still the god of this evil age. But I'm so glad that Jesus, he didn't fall for Satan's trick. He knew that he had to redeem it. He knew that he had to pay the price with his own life, his own blood. And in doing so, he redeemed you and I. &gt;&gt; That we are not under Satan's rule any longer. We are not under his domain. We are not under his possession. But we belong to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we know that this world belongs to us. But we don't want it the way that it is now. &gt;&gt; We want it to be renovated with fire. A holy fire. All the demonic forces of hell just totally destroyed and annihilated just like God has done for you and I. He's justified us, sanctified us. He's burnt us up with holy fire. And one of these days, we're going to come back to a perfect Eden again. But in the meantime, we're following his word, his headship, and it's taking us back to that perfect Eden. I'm glad that I know what this message is about. I know I I'm glad that I know it's my identity. It's my headship. It's It's more than just a man. It's more than just a good idea. It's more than just a philosophy, but it's Jesus Christ. And he is leading his church. And he promised he'll never leave us. He'll never direct us the wrong path. But he's leading us step by step, word by word. And it's a perfect direction. As long as we stay true to the course, follow the word, follow his angel, it'll take us into our body change. Amen. And so we want to say what an honor it is to to be here again. And we uh we just uh just had a good time uh last night in the word and and uh in his presence and uh it is a uh it is a fast trip. Amen. Uh we're going home and uh we got to get uh we got to get prepared for another trip that is coming up. we'll we'll be going to uh Pakistan and and uh so we definitely covet your your prayers uh for us there trying to just do something for the Lord and for the kingdom of God and and uh just to bring encouragement and you know we we we just have a desire to preach the message but but he's a living God &gt;&gt; and uh we still believe he's saving souls. He's still healing, delivering, filling with the Holy Ghost. We believe that it's a it's a great season that God is moving in his word and his spirit and blessing his people and and he's doing the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could even ask or even think. That's our God and that's the age that we're living in. And so uh again we appreciate uh brother oid and uh just for inviting us to come and uh you know uh it was great faith uh for your pastor to have have us come uh because he didn't know me and uh quite frankly uh I didn't know him and uh so but uh getting acquainted with brother Isaac there in Uganda and we just had uh some good fellowship and uh God just uh uh allowed this to come about and so you know our our heart is just to put our shoulder behind the wheel and and uh we're not bringing anything new but we just want to preach the message and uh we just want to want to preach the the faith that God has placed in our hearts and may it be a strength and a blessing to you and uh so if you have your Bibles We want to uh turn to Colossians the first chapter and we're going to begin reading at verse 17 and go to the 18th verse and uh then we'll turn over to Colossians the 3r chapter and begin reading from verse one. How many appreciates the word? Colossians 1 and verse 17. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. Just say that with me. That in all things &gt;&gt; he might have the preeminence. Now, Colossians the 3r chapter beginning at verse one. We'll just read the first four verses. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life. I just love that. When Christ who is our life shall appear or shall be made manifest, then shall you also appear with him in glory. I believe we're living in the fulfillment of these portions of scripture. And may God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You may be seated. We'd like to just take for a text the motivating force of our lives. We are a part of a kingdom where Christ is king. And we have come in this age into position with him into his domain. And that is the position that God has called us to because we are in a dispensation of overcoming. It's a dispensation of conquering. And Jesus Christ has already overcome. He's overcome Satan's kingdom. He's already overcome Satan's rule and his domain. But now it is our time that as we as we overcome then he promised that we will set with him in his domain in his rule. And so that is what we are a part of. We're not a part of a denomination. We're not a part of just a a certain cult or a certain sect, but we are a part of a kingdom where Christ is head. He is our king and we are his subject. The prophet of God would show us that it's the spirit that motivates us. It's the spirit that motivates anything. And he would say that his gift, it's uh it's a little bit different than just being a preacher or something. And but he what he was letting the church know under that prophetic gift, he was he he discerned spirits and he would begin to he was able to watch and he would let us know that every home has a spirit behind it. Every church has a spirit behind it. Every individual has a spirit behind it. And the prophet would say that we should have discernment of spirit. We're very familiar with that with that message the prophet preached. He would say that that's where we must discern today. The spirit of a man. What's he trying to do? What's he getting at? Not what group he belongs to or what this that or the other. Whether he's a white man, black man, yellow man, or whatever he is. Let's see what he's trying to achieve and take that. See what he's trying to do for the kingdom of God. He's got odd ideas to ours. That's perfectly all right. If he's trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God, discern that in him. If he's wrong and true and hard, God will bring him around to the truth of the thing after a while. Let him alone. Let him alone. See what he's trying to do. So the prophet of God would actually teach us that he would rather be uh right in his spirit. Amen. That's what is important is to have the right spirit because it's it's your spirit that affects your life. If you get something in your spirit, maybe just an a little oddness in your spirit, you watch it'll begin to you you you begin to act that out. you begin to act a little bit different toward a brother or toward a spirit or toward even maybe children to a parent or a wife to a husband and vice versa. And it's because it's your spirit. It if you can get something in that spirit that affects your life, it affects your actions. It But you see, that's why the the prophet would let us know that you've got to keep your spirit clean. You've got to just always discern even the spirit of your own life. Because if we're acting a little bit different and a little bit odd and there's separation in the church and maybe allowing little differences and a little petty ideas, it'll separate brotherhood. It'll bring friction in the church. And a lot of times I I would even say this, nine out of 10 times it's not even your brother. It's just because something is affecting your spirit. And it's a it's something in you that you got to get purged of that. Get it out of your system. Get out of your spirit. Maybe it's in your conscience. It's in your imagination. Maybe it's in your memory. And something keeps coming up. But that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is to keep us clean. You see, it's the blood that purifies the church. Amen. So, as long as we've got the clean, pure, virtuous blood of Jesus Christ flowing to the through the church, then it brings healing and it brings unity and it brings oneness and it and it keeps us going in the right direction. Amen. That's what the church of the living God needs. Amen. The prophet would say what the problem is in the church. The reason that it's sick, it's anemic. It needs the blood. And I tell you, it's still true for the church today. We need the blood of Jesus Christ to continually flow into the body. What is the blood is the life. Amen. So, as long as we've got the blood, we've got the life, and it's what keeps us clean. It motivates us in the right direction. Now, you see, amen. The prophet of God would say that the gates of hell is not against your a certain government. Amen. It It's not against a certain denomination. It's not against a certain church system. And we're talking about the gates of hell. Amen. The gates of hell is against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. So that puts it puts us into focus. What Satan is after is against that spiritual revelation of who is among us right now. Well, let's just put it the way the prophet said it. The same pillar of fire that wrote the Old Testament was with the same pillar of fire that was with Paul that wrote the New Testament. And it's the same pillar of fire interpreting the Bible today. It's not a new book. We're not adding to it. We're not taking it away. But it's the same Christ here interpreting the word and bringing spiritual understanding to the church of the living God. That's what Satan is after. is after the spiritual revelation of the kingdom of God on the earth now and that we are a part of his domain sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every spirit of hell already under our feet. Uh it is supreme authority that has come to the church of the living God. Amen. And we're not looking backward at 1963. We're not looking forward to what is going to happen tomorrow, but we are standing upon a present tense divine supernatural revelation of Christ in me. The hope of glory and every demonic power of hell is under the feet of this bride. Uh, every power of Hollywood is under my feet. Uh, every power of demonic denominational systems and ideas of man is under my feet. Uh I've got one direction uh and that is to march uh in the step uh of the supreme authority of the vindicated message of the hour and it's going to lead me to a body change. It's going to rapture my soul. I'm going to step into that new body. Hallelujah. You see the prophet of God would say that you've got to do discern two spirits that are within the framework of the church. And that is a cane spirit. And that can spirit is against the spiritual revelation that is coming to the elect. You see, it's the spiritual revelation that that provides the place of worship. Amen. The place of worship is divine revelation to the individual. Hallelujah. So the king spirit, the intellectual believer that can worship, that has an altar, that comes to church, but what he's really after, he is offended at the spiritual revelation that the God's provided place of worship has been revealed. Uh, and it's not another, it's not a certain church. It's not in Jeffersonville. It's not in Trinidad. It's not in Ohio. It's not a certain nation. Uh the spiritual re revelation of God's provided place of worship is found in spirit and in truth. Uh that is God's provided place uh that he promised he will meet the worshiper in this day. So that Cain spirit, Amen, that Cain spirit is after that. You see, look at the response that God had to Cain. Just just worship the way your brother worshiped. You see, just just if you can just follow the blueprint that I have vindicated, just follow the word and just do what your brother I I'll I favor you. You see, God knew that that was serpent seed. Amen. God knew who Cain really was. But yet God was still amen extending mercy and saying just just follow what your brother is doing. But you see the Cain spirit, he's always persecuting the true believer. Amen. And I tell you friends, uh let's get every spirit off of us that would be offended at our brother, that would be offended against one another. Let's stand for the word. Uh let it motivate our life. Uh let the Holy Ghost uh keep us pure and keep the odds off of us. Uh because we're all wanting one thing and that is the rapture. That is the body change. [Applause] You see, the prophet of God would let us know that that's what's taking place right now. Amen. And he was saying, "Let's go back to Cain again and get some of the faith in the beginning. Watch those spirits how they begin to move." It's the spirit of anything that does the work of it. Anyhow, the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days. The people's in the spirit of the latter days. The nations are in the spirit of the end time. They got atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the day. The people are in the spirit of the end time. The church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit. And the world's running out yondering, making fun, scoffing, laughing, and they living like the devil every day. It's in the spirit of the thing. God's getting ready to take his. And the devil's getting ready to take his. So now we see the picture of what is happening today. A man is really Satan is taking his and God is taking his. Now motive. Now brother Brandon would say that you've got to you've got to look at motives and objectives. You see and it's the spirit that motivates. So motive is a reason for doing something. Now, if you look in the old ang uh the the the old English where it comes from, it actually says to move. Amen. So, when we're talking about a motive, we're talking about a reason for doing something, but we're also talking about to move. So, motive is actually an action. It is something, amen, that is putting you into action. It's moving you. Now, now listen what the prophet of God says in the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age. We're entering the raptured age. You know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better. It must get worse. How many knows that? Say amen. The prophet said it. We say amen. It's got to get worse and it can't go like this. It's got to be something. And it's moving right now, friend. It's on. The move is on for the bride. That's the truth. That's thus saith the Lord. Amen. So, the prophet of God is showing. Amen. The thing that we have been waiting for. Amen. To bring us out of just a church system or or a church idea which can never make the body change. that can never mana manifest the presence of God. But the move to come out of that into another age is already taking place. You see what put forth what started the move was the opening of the word that called us out. Come out of her, my people. Come out of her plagues. Don't be partakers of her plagues. Don't be partakers of her unbelief. Come out of that. So, it's a prophet chopping a bride loose. Uh, it's exodus time. Uh, the move is on. Come out of that system and come into the raptured age. Amen. You see, it's the we've entered into the raptured age. &gt;&gt; And let me say it like this. We've crossed Jordan into his age. Amen. We've crossed Jordan into the word age. Now the prophet of God would say his age is the word age. We've had Leosa, cold, lukewarm, formal. That's their age. That's the Pentecostal age. We've had the Luther age. We've had the Wesley age. We've had the Pentecostal age. But this is his age. This is when he is marrying a bride. It's an invisible union becoming one with his bride. This is his age. It's the marriage age. It's the time that the word and the bride become one flesh. That supreme authority enters into the bride and she knows who she is. She understands her position because supreme authority has placed her back into position like Adam was in the Garden of Eden. Like the moon is in its position, the sun is in its position, the stars are in their position. Now by a word in this hour, the church has been placed into position. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, he's placed us into rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word that had been sealed up, that had been the hand in the hands of the original owner, the title deed, has now been placed into the hands of the bride. The lamb came and claimed the book, opened the seals, and now he's claimed what he's redeemed, and now he has placed rapturing faith into your hands. It's in your heart. You're not wondering if you're going to make it. You know you're going to make it. You're not wondering if your children are going to make it. You know you're going to make it. It's because God in his grace paid the price at Calvary and he is interceding upon his people. And now he's come to claim what he has redeemed. That's what the Holy Ghost is doing. He's claiming you. He's claiming mamas. He's claiming daddies. He's claiming children. He's putting you in your position and telling you this is a raptured age. The move is on for the bride. That's thus saith the Lord. [Music] [Applause] You see, the prophet of God would let us know we've moved on up into the realm of the Lord's thinking. This is not the thinking of a man, but we've moved on up. Come up higher. Come out of that lay on a sea and age. There's an open door. I am the door. I am the word. I am made manifest to you. Christ who is our life hath appeared. And when he was made manifest, I seen my name. I seen that I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world. And now when he was made manifest, I have appeared. I have been made manifest and I seen a word a door made manifest and I step through it. I step through it. What is it doing? Bringing me into my adoption. Bringing me into my authority. Bringing me into position. [Applause] Not earthbound. Not staying in that earthbound leosia. stepping through by a prophetic anointing, an eagle anointing, a power to lift me up, to move me up and step into my authority. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to listen to this message like never before. It's positioning you. It's showing you who you are. It's changing you. everyone that has received the new birth. Now, this word is transforming you. It's the power of transformation. It's holding you. It's cutting you. It's taking the world out of us. [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a raptured age. We moved on into the realm of the Lord's thinking. That means it's a different spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not your thinking any longer. We still have our thinking. &gt;&gt; We think a lot of things. Sometimes your wife may come in the room and she doesn't do something just right the way you like and you think a lot of things. Your boss says a little something or does something and you think a lot of things. Your pastor preaches a certain thing that maybe you're h maybe roughs you up a little bit. You think a lot of things. We're still in this flesh. We still have our thinking. But Paul said, "I've got to die daily. I tell you, die to every spirit. Die to every influence that would try to control your life." Hallelujah. Replace bitterness for love. That's how you get rid of a bitter spirit. Amen. Come into the presence of God and say, "Oh God, melt me all over again. Soften my spirit. Give me love for my brother. Give me love, oh God. Uh pour out that pour out that spirit of love within my heart. You'll come out of it. [Applause] You see, remember we said it last night, but I it bears repeating. Remember there is no more power goes out after that eagle. No power &gt;&gt; comes forth to give the bride overcoming power outside of this message. &gt;&gt; You see it's the eagle anointing. It's a vindicated word and we are seeing that we are a part of that prophetic word &gt;&gt; that God already forneew you. So he sent a prophet and he spoke himself a bride into existence. [Music] And the grace, rapturing grace that is upon our life is what is allowing us to see that that's my position. That's who I am. You may not feel like it. You may be going through the worst trial of your life, but it doesn't change anything. Your confession, that's me. Something's motivating you. Something is empowering you. Amen. to identify with what God spoke through a prophet and said, "This is who my bride is. She's perfect. She's sinless. She's virtuous. She's justified. As if she never sinned in the first place. I know Satan's trying to motivate your spirit realm. He's trying to motivate your memory and motivate your imagination and your conscience and your reasoning and and what you see and what you hear and how you feel. But we are lifted above those rims. You got to die out to those things. You got to die daily to those things. You got to lift up into the rim of the Lord's thinking. What does he say about me? What does he who does he say I am? Who does he say that my position is? And when it becomes a clear voice, a certain sound, then you step into it and say, "That's who I am. That's who I am. That's my position." And in that position, I have the authority to defeat the devil any place, anywhere, on any grounds. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is this eagle anointing? What has it done? And it's brought us back to the original word. &gt;&gt; You see, it's the word anointed for the age. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says it was the anointed man. Now it's the anointed people. &gt;&gt; It was the anointed bridegroom &gt;&gt; saying this day this scripture is fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointed bridegroom that can take the word and say, "Moses wrote about me. Isaiah wrote about me. Jeremiah wrote about me. The types in the wilderness, the the the the the Holy of Holies and all of the furniture in the temple, it's about me." &gt;&gt; And he can look at that word and he can identify himself and say, "It's written of me. This was done because it's written. &gt;&gt; This is done because it's written. The whole direction for his life. I go here because I do nothing except I first see the father do it. You see the revelation of sunship is following the revealed will of God. And the bride will have thus sayeth the Lord or she stands still. And this bride has been standing still long enough. But I declare unto you, we have thus, sayeth the Lord, by his stripes, I'm healed. By my token, I'm saved, and my children are saved. We've been standing still long enough. Let this word motivate us. Let the Holy Ghost motivate us. Let it put us into the move of God that that that we are in a raptured age. It's a rapture anointing. It's a rapture grace. It's a rapture faith to believe what the word says about me that I'm the bloodbought sinless bride of Jesus Christ. Anointed. Anointed. The anointing is supreme power under control. Anointed. Not a bunch of Pentecostal babies, but anointed. Not just an emotion, but an anointing. Not just a shout, but an anointing. Because where the revelation is revealed, there's a stimulation. And when the word is made manifest and we can see this is that, then we step into the motion. Such as I have give I thee. And the prophet of God says, what did Peter have? He had a faith. He was anointed. He was anointed to pray for the sick. He was anointed to take a brother by the hand and say, "You don't have to stay bound. You don't have to stay defeated. You don't have to stay discouraged. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get out of that jail. Get out of that hybrid. Get away from those man-made ideology. Come into the move. [Music] a hand of faith that it can unlock the promises. And brother Brandham, after he spoke, he that is in you and he told us about what happened with the spoken word, how that a storm was spoke out of existence, then he turns to the church and says what Peter said, such as I have give I thee. What did Peter give? He gave him faith. And such as I have, the prophet said, I give you faith for the hour. I give you faith for the hour. That's the faith of the hour. How to be healed. How to hold on to your healing. Un unfolding demonology. Unfolding the two spirits within the framework of the church. An unfolding headship. &gt;&gt; The faith from 47 to 65. Faith. The faith. Amen. A restored faith. A faith that says, "Now say you're healed. Now say you're delivered. Now say your sons. Now say you're raptured. Now say it. We are possessors of all things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are possessors of all things &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the millennium. &gt;&gt; We are possessors of all things. &gt;&gt; We are sons. &gt;&gt; We are daughters. We're not waiting for a greater power. We're not waiting for a greater anointing. We're not waiting for some man to rise up to tell us the move is on. We have already received a son of man revealing the son of man. And he surrendered to the voice of God so he could tell you the move is on. Thus sayeth the Lord, the rapture age has already began. It began with a shout. It began when the Lord himself descended. And he descended with a shout, a message uh that was bringing on a bride uh that she can recognize her authority, recognize her position, that she is that message. She and the word are one that when you speak is the voice of resurrection. You've got the power of death and life in your tongue. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know I'm in the scripture. Death and life is in the tongue. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to make sure you know what's in your spirit. &gt;&gt; We are not babies any longer. Gag gag goooo. And we can spout out the mouth anything we want to. We are mature sons. &gt;&gt; We have been ripening under this vindicated message for some 50, 60 years now. If we're not mature now, when? &gt;&gt; If we're not ready for adoption now, then when? If we're not ready for the change of our bodies now, then when? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there's something about a mama &gt;&gt; that when the devil has been beating you up and beating you up and beating you up and then you begin to hear this message, you hear your pastor preaching this message and something strikes your heart and says, "I know my position. I have been ordained &gt;&gt; to be a mama. &gt;&gt; And when that demon tries to get a hold of your sick child, &gt;&gt; something rises up in your heart and begins to move you &gt;&gt; and you stand up in your position and say, "Satan, you have no claims upon my child." When the devil tries to come into your home and he's trying to wreak havoc in your home and you stand up and put your shoulders back and say, "Satan, I'll have nothing of it." It's because you know who you are. You know your position. You know that you have been claimed by the blood of Jesus Christ. And the Holy Ghost is motivating you to stand up. Stand up. Take back what the devil's been stealing from you. Claim your mountain. Tell you young people, you're a Joshua generation. You're a royal priesthood. You're a chosen people. You're a chosen group. I say God has allowed you to be born in this age that all the fighting and the fussing has already went through. Now you've got the claim to believe it. You don't have to fight over it. Just start walking. Just start walking. Just start walking. Claim your promise. Claim your promise. Claim who you are. Stand in your position. We are a generation of possessors. We are a generation of possessors. We are a generation that has turned the corner. We've turned the corner. We've entered in another dispensation. It's a dispensation of adoption, stepping into our position. We're not fussing. We're not fighting. We're not worried about groups. We're worried about one thing. Are we pleasing him? This is not the man age any longer. It's the eagle anointing. It's not the age of apostles and dictatorships of men. It's the time for the bride to come under her headship and say, "He is my Lord. He is my all and all. He is one I'm following." &gt;&gt; You take this message, it'll take you into adoption. [Applause] And it won't be what you feel. It's not what you feel like a shiver up and down your spine. It's simply a knowing. That's me. &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; That's me. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's me. We heard a prophet say &gt;&gt; she is him. &gt;&gt; And we have shouted and rejoiced over that &gt;&gt; she is him. And then we begin to take that quote &gt;&gt; and it just becomes something that we quoted &gt;&gt; and we begin to look around and say she is him. &gt;&gt; But you see an identified bride &gt;&gt; says she is him. Oh, he's talking about me. &gt;&gt; I am him. [Applause] [Music] I am him. &gt;&gt; You're going to work in the morning. I am him. You're going to school, young people. I am him. I am his expression. He is the son, but I'm the expression. I am reflecting his power. I'm reflecting his anointing. I'm reflecting that he's the mighty conqueror. I'm reflecting because he lives, I live. Not reflecting defeat. Not reflecting cowarding down. Why are we hiding behind rocks? Let's take f a i t j e s u s and go defeat that giant. Go defeat depression. Defeat homosexuality. Defeat pornography. defeat marriage crisis. I am him. The mighty conqueror who overcome death, hell, and the grave is abiding in me. I am him. I am a conqueror. I'm an overcomer. I have overcome death, hell, and the grave. Nothing can keep me out of the rapture. Nothing can keep me out of the body change. Nothing can keep me from an overcoming life. I am him. Now we are sons. Now we are positionally placed. Now we are seated in heavenly places. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe we've come to an age of understanding. &gt;&gt; Daniel 12 says, "Shut up the words in this book. Seal the book until the end. Knowledge shall increase. None of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. You see, Paul said, "I pray, I've heard of your faith, but I pray that the spirit of wisdom and revelation would come to give you understanding. The eyes of your understanding would be open that you would know the hope of your calling. You're called with a holy calling." The high priest had a holy calling. Come into the shad glory. And Jesus came with a holy calling to tear down the wall, the barrier separating us from his presence. And now we've got a holy calling. Come into divine presence. It doesn't matter your age. It doesn't matter if you've been in the message 50 years or 2 seconds. &gt;&gt; God is calling you. Come into the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is calling you to a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; He's bringing us to an age of understanding. The wicked will do on just continue to do more wickedly. The move is on for them. The move is on for Russia. Russia's doing what she's doing because it's time for it. &gt;&gt; China's doing what China is doing because it's time for it. And the bride is doing what she's doing because it's time for it. &gt;&gt; What time is it, hers? It's bride time. Rise and shine. Trim your lamps. Get the world out of you. Get focused back upon thus sayeth the Lord. It's bride time. It's bride age. The anointing of the son of man is lifting us up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're no longer children, &gt;&gt; but we've grown into full age. &gt;&gt; Strong meat belongs to them of full age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But then there's a five-fold ministry that is preaching this message and waving this adoption message over the children of God and saying, "It's season. It's the time for it. Come into full age. &gt;&gt; The word is here." &gt;&gt; Pentecost message ain't going to ever produce a full age. But Jesus come in the dispensation of the fullness of time when every scripture that was ever prophesied of him was now coming into full manifestation. And this bride has been waiting for seven church ages to hear that voice come out of her. Come out of every camp of tradition, come out of the limits of man and now come into this age of full adoption, full sunship, full authority. We're preaching a message that is releasing faith to the people that has given you the rights and the authority to say you are already perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ. And now by a vindicated message, you have come into sunship, full sunship. We've been ripening and ripening. But the prophet of God would say in 63, 64, 65, I hear the coming of the combines. is because the harvest is here. The harvest is ripe. The seeds have been planted and now they're ripening. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, now I heard a prophet said, "What needs to happen is what you need is to ripen because we're still green. &gt;&gt; The crop's still green." Now, now, now that was that was what about 50 years ago. &gt;&gt; You see what he's waiting on is to someone stand to their feet and realize, wait a minute, I've been ripening. &gt;&gt; And I can honestly say that we are not just preaching that God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; We are not just preaching that, well, someday it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. But we are actually looking at a message with our eyes wide open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's been maturing us all along. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But then then I heard a prophet say, you know, you always need a little bit of greenness. &gt;&gt; Now I I'm going to be honest with you. When I seen that, I thought, really? And then the prophet of God was showing us that when you get so all of the greenness, greenness is a sign of life. &gt;&gt; You never get an attitude of I've arrived. &gt;&gt; And you get so stiff and starchy that when the move of the Holy Ghost starts blowing, you can't move. &gt;&gt; That ain't maturity. someone that stands up and says, "I've got all the message. I know more than you and everything else and you need to come under me." That is not the message. &gt;&gt; But as someone that's been growing and growing and growing and growing and growing and but all along she's realizing without his grace I am nothing. Without this message I am nothing. Without his power I am nothing. I'm just frail dust. Without his blood I'm anemic. I'll fall apart. I fall apart with the world. So when the Holy Ghost begins to breathe and and brood and move on the congregation, there's some greenness that begins to blow those leaves and blow those branches and something begins to say, "I need more of God. I I I've got to have more of this life. I've got to have more of his perfection. I've got to have this message. Amen. I've got to die daily. I I've got to get my own stinking thinking out of me. I've got to get my own pride out of me. I've got. But all the while you realize I'm an oak tree. I have been destined for this. I have been placed persistently. I have grown in this message and there's life flowing through me. [Applause] Every time a wind comes blowing your way, you're not saying, "Oh, I guess I'm just not a son of God. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm not going to make it." &gt;&gt; No, sir. You want to have an understanding of who you are. &gt;&gt; You have been destined to defeat the devil in his own Eden. And those branches are saying, "Praise be to God. I know who is motivating my life. I know who's living through me. I know it's it's by grace that I am what I am." But there's something motivating you to keep pressing the battle. Keep speaking that word. Keep professing who you are. Keep standing there saying, "As the moon is placed, I have been placed. As the sun has been placed, I have been placed. Not reflecting our own ideas any longer. We've come into full age. We are reflecting the word for this age. [Music] You see, the prophet of God would say, quoting Revelations 3:7, "These things saith he that is true." Now this word true is a very wonderful word. &gt;&gt; It does not mean true in just the sense that is opposite to false. It expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial re realization. &gt;&gt; For example, we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. John 15:1, I am the true vine. Hebrews 9:24, for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with uh with hands which are the figure of the true, but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us. 1 John 2:8. Because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth. Since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as is illustrated in these verses, we can now understand as never before anti-ype contrasted with type and substance with shadow. So when Jesus was saying, "I am the bread that came down from heaven," &gt;&gt; he was showing that what Moses had was the partial. &gt;&gt; The mana that was falling from heaven was the partial. &gt;&gt; And they were holding to a partial realization, &gt;&gt; a partial understanding. Our fathers ate mana in the wilderness, but Jesus said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." So they got confused between the partial and the perfect. You see, one is a shadow, the other is a perfect. And for seven church ages, we've been hearing shadow. But now in the last days, we've not heard just from the shadow. We've heard from the son. The son himself has spoke in the last days to bring us from a type and a shadow to a perfect realization. It's Christ here. It's the bread of life here. It's his shakana glory here. It's the mighty contour here. Now we are sons of God. Therefore, we move from the prophecy to the fulfillment because now he's speaking to us in this last days by his son. &gt;&gt; You see, we put off childish things. For Paul said, we knew in part, but now we pro and we prophesied in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I become a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're a child, you don't have full understanding. Your dad is telling you, son, this is who you are. He's telling you about life. He's telling you about responsibilities. You're growing. You're growing up into age, but I'm not going to give my 10year-old the keys to my car. I'm not I'm not going to tell my six-year-old that he has got full responsibility. But you see, he's growing up. He's being tutored. He's being shown responsibility. He's being shown my desires. Amen. But you see, when he comes into full age, he just steps into his position, it's not what I force him to do. is not what I make him to do. There's something within him as a son that he just comes because it's the time for it. It's the season for it. [Applause] Brother Isaac, I've got an 18-year-old boy. He's about to be 19. And I've been watching the transformation. Amen. Before I would have to sit down and I was showing him as he's growing up and I would tell him, "Now, son, this is how you do this and this is what you do." and I'm I'm I'm I'm advising him and I'm telling him integrity and I'm telling him about responsibility, but then I've been gone. I've been going on these meetings and trips and and I've not been home and and and and my wife is telling me, "Oh, you'd be so proud of Nathaniel because he's stepping into responsibility. Before I had to tell him, before I had to check, you know, you aren't you going to do it? This is your job. This is your chore. This is your responsibility." But now he's just stepping into his position. He's just accepting the responsibility. No one is having to make him. No one has to beat it into him. No one has to just teach him and teach him and teach him. Sometimes teaching and teaching and teaching, it ain't going to do you any good. We already know. But it takes the Holy Ghost, the season, the time of adoption where the Holy Ghost begins to motivate you and say, "Step into it. Mama, step into it. Daddy, step into it. Ministry, be who you are, [Applause] &gt;&gt; not beating you and beating you and beating you. But something within the DNA of a Christian realizes the winds are blowing realizes the season that we're in and begins to move into it. Satan, get away from me. Satan, get away from my wife. Satan, get away from my husband. Satan, get out of my house. Satan, you can't have my children. [Music] It's because you've got someone greater than your pastor going home with you. You got someone greater than brother Isaac going home with you. You got someone greater than your prophet going home with you. You've got the son of man living inside you. And he's breathing through you. He's motivating you. He's pulsating his life through you. [Applause] And then you turn around to your children and say, "The faith that I have, I give you &gt;&gt; the confidence I have in this message. I give you the confidence that I know that this message lives and it works and it's life-changing. I give you. I'm sorry. I'm just preaching. I feel good." Amen. Because I feel the courage. I feel the strength of of El Shadi flowing through me. He's saying I'm the breasted one. Feed on my promises. Feed on my promises. It's going to bring you to a a manifestation of every promise [Applause] season. &gt;&gt; When God called Abraham by election, it was a season of coming out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 12 &gt;&gt; Abraham Abram called &gt;&gt; Genesis 15 was a season that he needed the word the promise the covenant confirmed. &gt;&gt; It says I you say that I'm going to have a seed but I don't know. &gt;&gt; How am I going to know? Maybe it's through my servant Eleazar. And God comes down and shows Abraham shows Abram that he is just he's a man. He's worthy of hell. He's doomed for hell. That's where he's going. But then Abraham is he puts God God puts Abram to sleep. And he comes I don't I don't have time to go through everything. You you understand where I'm at, right? Genesis 15. And then God comes through the sacrifices and walks that pillar of fire walks through there and says, "Abram, you're worthy of hell. That's where you That's where you were going. But Abram, I've changed your direction. &gt;&gt; And as I have called you, I am the alpha and I'm also the omega. I'm going to bring the promise to pass &gt;&gt; and it's going to come through you. &gt;&gt; Genesis. Then Genesis 17 comes around and Abraham's an old man &gt;&gt; and he's been holding this promise and holding fast to this promise and saying, "God is faithful. God's going to bring it to pass. And El Shadi, God Almighty, &gt;&gt; comes to Abram and says,"Abram, I'm going to be your mother. Abram, you're an old man now. You're 99 years old." And Abram, you don't have the strength, do you? &gt;&gt; Oh, how God brings us and and just brings our humanity to a place that all we can see is our failures. All we can see is our own mistakes. &gt;&gt; And he blows it up. Saggy arms, hurt back, &gt;&gt; hurt knees, arthritis, &gt;&gt; Abram, you've been holding to this promise for 24 years. But Abram, I'm going to reveal myself now to you as God Almighty. &gt;&gt; I'm El Shadi. &gt;&gt; Now, Abram, you just keep nursing on the promise. But then a few verses later, &gt;&gt; that same God Almighty comes down and says, "I'm Elohim." &gt;&gt; Now, Abram, you can't manifest the promises just Abram. &gt;&gt; But you've got to have a name change. &gt;&gt; So now, Abram, I'm going to give you a part of my own name, &gt;&gt; Elohim. I think that's how I was I was told they they they're heavy on that H. Elohim. &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abram, I'm going to give you a I'm going to give you a part of my own name. Abram, you're going to take on my identity. &gt;&gt; Abram, you've been you're nursing on the promise, but now I'm going to show you. You're not Abram any longer. You're Abraham. That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God shows us now grace covenant, &gt;&gt; an unconditional covenant, not if you will, I will, &gt;&gt; but simply grace. &gt;&gt; Genesis 12, Abraham or Abram was justified just like our walk. It parallels the seed of Abraham, our walk perfectly. Justification, Genesis 12. Sanctification, Genesis uh 15. Baptism of the Holy Ghost, Genesis 17. I'm El Shadi. The Holy Ghost coming in. But then a few verses later, adoption, the name change. The prophet of God says, notice from Genesis 12, Genesis 15, 15, it was many years. Genesis 15 to Genesis 17, many years. But when it comes to Genesis 17, from the Holy Ghost to adoption, it's only a few days. What is he showing us? It's the season. Justification made way for sanctification. Sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Brother Brandham is now at the dispensation change. &gt;&gt; And he's at the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; God had already showed him. He's already told the church there's a climax, a second climax to my ministry. We've already went through the first two pools. Amen. The discern uh the healing of the sick in the sign of the hand and then the discernment, the the the the the visions of the discerning the the thoughts intents of the heart. But now there's a second climax which is the opening of the word, the third pull. &gt;&gt; And as he's now turning the corner, he's changing the dispensation. The lamb is coming to take the book. &gt;&gt; The same time that Revelations 10:7 is on the earth, Revelations 10:1 is upon the earth. And now the prophet of God is he's he's he's he's bringing this understanding and he's talking to the church of the living God and he's breaking the seals and he's bringing an understanding but then he stops and he says now so you will understand I don't call you church I'm going to call you bride what is he showing the name is changing denominational ages is ending the time to be all just the call out, just the church, just the people of God. That dispensation is ending. And now there's a dispensation of a headship. You are now the bride of Jesus Christ. [Applause] He's showing you the adoption season is now. Seven angels on Mount Sunset, the constellation of angels. I tell you friends, that constellation of angels means everything to us. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. When I got on the plane and I came here, I've got a passport. &gt;&gt; When they want to see my passport, they open it up and they took a picture, not of my body. They took a picture of my head &gt;&gt; and when they see that head, &gt;&gt; they look at the head and they look at me and they look at the head and they look at me and then they look at all the credentials. &gt;&gt; And they identify that that's who I am. &gt;&gt; You know what that gives me the right to? To go through security. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be handcuffed. I don't have to be restrained. I don't have to be con I don't have to be looked at as some criminal. But they're looking at identity and saying, "You've got the right. &gt;&gt; When I go to my airplane this evening, I have already received a notice, a message that you can check in. I have already put my passport, the token. It's already on file. I've already checked in. I'm not worried about my flight. My name's on the record. My seat is on the plane. [Music] So this evening, I'm just letting you know I'm not scared. I'm not worried. I'm not worried that there won't be a seat for me because my name is already attached to a seat. I'm already a part of the bride. I'm already a part of the raptured age. I'm already in the dispensation of adoption. [Music] You know what I'm going to do? Brother Isaac is going to drop me off at the airport. And when they say all aboard, I'm just going to get myself up out of my seat. I'm going to walk into the line and I'm going to have confidence. And when they when I stand before that little that little image, it's going to take a picture. It's going to reflect my image and it's going to say that is Jonathan Martin. It's not going to be cared about my body. [Applause] [Music] But where my head goes, my body goes. When they allow my head, when I see my position and I'm walking into my position, my body does not have its own intelligence. My body is not arguing with my headship saying, "Are you sure we can do this? Are you sure that we can get on this plane? You dummy. You've got too much authority. You've got you're taking too much confidence. My body is under the control of my mind &gt;&gt; and my mind already is confident. My mind is already secure. &gt;&gt; Nope, not mine. &gt;&gt; Nope, that's not mine. Nope. Nope, that's not mine. Oh, there it is. &gt;&gt; And I just Excuse me. Th this is my seat. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried &gt;&gt; because it already says 24E is your seat. &gt;&gt; And when I get into my seat, [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. [Applause] I'm ready, &gt;&gt; confident, secure. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And when I feel the power, I feel those jets. [Music] And all of a sudden, my seat begins to vibrate. Oh, buddy, I love it. It puts a thrill in my soul. You know why? because I love feeling it take off. I love feeling the power as I begin to settle in my seat and I know that I'm going up. It's a raptured age. I'm a part of the rapture. I'm in my seat. I've got my token. I am secure. I'm feeling the move. I'm feeling the power. It's taking me higher and higher and higher. [Applause] Look at me now, devil. Look at me now, devil. Look at me now, devil. You held me in Leosa. You held me as a captive. But look at me now. I'm free. I'm under the eagle anointing, the eagle power, a prophetic message that has placed me, secured me, told me I'm my identity. Devil, look at me now. [Applause] [Music] Put off those childish things. Put off childish fightings. Put off those types and shadows. We've come to the perfect I'm going to leave you with this. I didn't even get to my notes. [Music] &gt;&gt; The motivating force. A force means that is it takes a substance. &gt;&gt; Force means that there's an energy. There's a power. But then it also takes something that is substance &gt;&gt; and something that has direction. &gt;&gt; So force means &gt;&gt; I wish I had a I wish I had a ball. &gt;&gt; Ah, here we go. As long as you just put it there, that's not force. But force means something gets a hold of it. &gt;&gt; It says, "Now, where do I want it to go?" &gt;&gt; Can you catch serious motivating force of my life means that the mighty angel has come down? &gt;&gt; He's taken the book. And then he turned around and says, "Now this one, I've cut the garment out. &gt;&gt; It's elected for rapture, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to motivate it [Music] &gt;&gt; in a direction." &gt;&gt; So in other words, that didn't go. &gt;&gt; And then I'm over here trying to catch it. &gt;&gt; That's what we've had through the denominational ages. Winds of doctrine just moving us about with every wind. &gt;&gt; Don't know where to stand. Unstable. Thousands of voices. But then all of a sudden, the mighty angel comes down and said, "That's my elect. I've redeemed her. I had her in my mind. She was in me when I died at Calvary. It's finished. I've already called her. I've already justified her. I've already glorified her. She's already sitting in heavenly places. It's finished." But now the devil's been whipping her around and driving her from here to there and confusing her. But now I'm going to take her &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take her in my power. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a prophetic anointing &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give take her in the direction she's going this way. But see, she's going to have to repent from the direction she's been going. She will. She will. She's been following that man. I'm following that man. I'm following that man. But then here comes thus sayaeth the Lord. The rapture age is on. And the prophet gets a hold that word gets a hold of our life and there's a deep calling under the deep. Satan gets a hold of us. [Applause] That's what force means also. It means magnetized magnetism. You're going this way and all of a sudden a deep calling to the deep something pulls you and you see God forgive me. I've been going the wrong direction. I've I've got this attached to my spirit and that attached to my spirit and I've got funny feelings about this and funny feelings about this and I've got these thinking about this. Oh God, I surrender to the headship of the word. Take it all out of me. I repent. Oh God, thy will. I've come to do thy will. I've come in the volume of the word to do thy will. [Applause] Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And then that word begins to move you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The move is on &gt;&gt; for the bride. &gt;&gt; Do you know what it is? Once God sets it in motion, &gt;&gt; nothing can stop it. The gates of hell &gt;&gt; will not prevail against the revelation of him being here. Now let's let's let's break a further revelation of this because the prophet of God says it is Jesus Christ in bride form. &gt;&gt; She is him. You become the word &gt;&gt; as you allow the word to go through you, &gt;&gt; motivating your faith, energizing your faith, anointing your faith, &gt;&gt; and you begin to just go from glory to glory &gt;&gt; to glory. And the power of transformation is all over you. And then you hear the voice of Elohim just like he stood just like he ate ate meat and drank milk in the tent of in the tent of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That same voice is echoing to us. &gt;&gt; It's a vindicated word for this age. &gt;&gt; And it's as if we are sitting with Elohim at the tent. &gt;&gt; And all of those confusions that Sarah had &gt;&gt; complexes. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's for Hagar. &gt;&gt; It's for the others. It's for that church. It's for that individual. Let me let me just say this. The prophet of God said, "Christ is the mystery of God revealed." It's not to a group. It's to a revelation, to an individual. At that day, you shall know that I'm in the Father and the Father and me and I and you and you and me. It's not to a group. It's to mamas and daddies and boys and girls. [Music] makes us walk different. &gt;&gt; You you're you're you're just going to church and then all of a sudden, brother so and so is acting a little bit different. Something's He's got a courage. &gt;&gt; And you begin to look at that and say, "Lord, what's what's going on?" It's because revelation is breaking over his life. And you know what it is? It can happen to one, then it can happen to another, then it can happen. &gt;&gt; It's not to a group. It's to the individual. &gt;&gt; And then you're watching and that that that daddy is taking his mountain, defeating devils, whacking devil. He's going through trials and they don't bother him. Don't discourage. Oh, he's still flesh. He's still from here down, &gt;&gt; but his headship &gt;&gt; is his identity. [Applause] the words. That's why the prophet of God would say, "I am God's voice to you." &gt;&gt; Every time you listen to that message, the prophet of God would tell us, "It's not me. It's not the seventh angel. It's only what I've surrendered to. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just revealing him. It's him. I'm just the vessel that he's using. What is he trying to do? He's saying, "Don't get your confidence messed up. The devil's trying to rack your destroy your confidence." He said, "But don't don't listen. It's not me. I've got many mistakes. &gt;&gt; But listen to what I'm saying about him. That's the difference. &gt;&gt; We're men. We've got mistakes. We need the blood of Jesus Christ like everyone else." But listen to what we saying about him because he's never lost a battle. He's the alpha. He's the omega. He's the enforcer of his word. &gt;&gt; And as we're listening to that voice, it takes us right back to the tent of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Elohim speaking and maybe even we hear Abram or Abraham, where's thy wife Sarah? Brother Hovet, I I get beside myself &gt;&gt; because even in all of her unbelief &gt;&gt; and complexes &gt;&gt; because she was a part of the revelation &gt;&gt; because she was a part of her husband. &gt;&gt; Her name was changed too. There she was still wandering in her complexes. Me be the bride to me. Fulfill the promises. And her name was already changed. &gt;&gt; But it took the voice &gt;&gt; to say, "Where's your wife Sarah?" Name change. &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, she's in the tent behind you." Said, "Why did Said, I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." Why did she laugh? &gt;&gt; Then she comes out. &gt;&gt; So many times we find our appearing is in unbelief. &gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't laugh. Oh, yeah. But you did. &gt;&gt; You did. But Sarah, I want you to know that you're going to manifest this promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; God would have killed her, &gt;&gt; but she was a part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; She was a part of the promise and no one could take her place. &gt;&gt; God would have killed you and I, but we're a part of Christ and a part of the promise for this age. Brothers and sisters, your name has already been changed. You're not just a church. You're not a high priest. You're not a denomination. You're the virtuous, sinless bride of Jesus Christ. Uh, but it's time to get all of the unbelief out of us. Get all the skepticism out of us. Let the voice of Elohim strike our hearts. Let it motivate us like never before. Change our confession. Change our confession &gt;&gt; from just someone that is childless to someone that's a princess. You know, I woke up singing that song this morning. Give me Jesus. Can we just sing a line of that again? &gt;&gt; In the morning [Music] when I rise in the morning. When I rise in the morning, when I rise, oh, give me Jesus. [Music] Oh, give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. Oh, you can have all this world. Just give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. Just play it softly now. Could we bow our heads and just maybe you feel like Sarah this morning? Maybe you've got some complexes in your life. [Music] Maybe you're having a hard time seeing your true identity. Maybe you've got some mistakes in your past and and the devil's attacking your spirit and those memories and and it's just producing complexes and every time you try to get liberty, Satan moves right there and brings you back under captive to that complex. Maybe you're having a hard time. Mamas, I know you face great battles. Daddies, you face great battles, children, young people, while you're living in the hardest, hardest of times. [Music] But you see, the revelation is Christ is here and he's visiting us according to the time of life. His spirit is moving among us. Why don't you just make a fresh commitment to him? Why don't you just lay that complex aside for a moment? And maybe those fears of failure, just move them aside. The battles that you're going through, move them aside. Why don't you just look at Jesus right now? Just put all of your focus and all of your attention upon Jesus and say, "Lord, I need your help. Lord, I believe you. Lord, you've energized my faith this morning. And Lord Jesus, I want to take advantage of this moment. I want to say, "Oh God, help me. Take this complex away from me. Bring me out of all of the fear, all out of the confusion. Lord Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Lord, you're my head. You're the authority over my life, the authority over every situation. I just surrender myself to you, Lord. Father, I pray that you bless your people. I pray that you would help them, Lord. We're all flesh and blood. We've got the battles that we're facing and you know exactly what every every trial, every situation, the circumstances that your people are under. I pray, oh God, that you would be a word in season to their hearts. And this word, oh God, would so energize their faith that they would be able to say exactly what the word says, I am healed. You sent your word to heal us. And that word is for body, spirit, and soul. I pray, oh God, that they would release their faith right now as you're energizing their hearts, motivating them to just believe for all things. I pray that you would break every shackle, that you would remove every hindrance, and father just manifest yourself to every heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Jesus [Music] give me Jesus. [Music] You can have all this world. You can have You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. [Music] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Hallelujah.
