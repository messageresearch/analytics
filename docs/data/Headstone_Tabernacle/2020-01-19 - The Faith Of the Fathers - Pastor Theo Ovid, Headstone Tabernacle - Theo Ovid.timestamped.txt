[1:27:10] God told the Prophet because Thomas

[1:27:28] the way of the despised phew
[1:27:34] not everybody fight over anything
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:38] some churches already have the mana none
[1:27:41] of y'all then we put you see by standing
[1:27:43] the honorable death and because they
[1:27:47] have that man they figured out yet that
[1:27:49] eruption and these foolish virgins
[1:27:52] believers readin and their Bible
[1:27:54] there'll be two in a bed one taken not
[1:27:57] to groups it if they are to clarify you
[1:28:00] think I want to be in a group but the
[1:28:03] back is between a bit cruel for you
[1:28:08] there between the feel but two groups so
[1:28:13] then to become personal I wanna know
[1:28:16] what your knowledge is going on if I
[1:28:18] have to make it I don't want to
[1:28:19] compromise I want to know that I'm being
[1:28:22] equipped in order to make it and then I
[1:28:26] start to understand all this rupture is
[1:28:29] not an external team it's an internal
[1:28:32] thing you mean a power a magnetism got
[1:28:36] to be in me and when the great magnet
[1:28:39] come ago just magnetized me of oh I mean
[1:28:45] the priests I have nothing do that you
[1:28:47] mean I don't need it pasta - he can't
[1:28:52] give me that magazine you may not come
[1:28:54] from the Holy Ghost
[1:28:55] you mean that when they read me upper
[1:28:58] room they went to be activated or
[1:28:59] magnetized with the power of the Living
[1:29:02] God it was not cylinder entity of room
[1:29:05] for it wasn't for taking notes and write
[1:29:08] down in a book it was for power and that
[1:29:12] brought the faith not around them but in
[1:29:14] them so that's why Peter said silver and
[1:29:17] gold have I none such as I have I have I
[1:29:21] have I didn't have it yet
[1:29:23] I had something else but when this power
[1:29:25] come I have it no you mean and that have
[1:29:29] to come into you power to lay hands upon
[1:29:32] the sick
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:35] and you know they have to recover not no
[1:29:38] it's not no perhaps not I'm wondering
[1:29:40] that I'm hoping to recover they have to
[1:29:42] recover because power is in your body I
[1:29:44] was in your spirit powers in your soul
[1:29:48] powers in your hand powers in your mouth
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:30:01] permitting Friday Willapa for time and
[1:30:04] we'll share with them about the unction
[1:30:07] of the Holy Ghost and how Ocean is what
[1:30:10] give your prayer wings with all the
[1:30:14] unction of the Spirit you see in words
[1:30:18] you're seeing the best that you know how
[1:30:20] and what not but when the Spirit comes
[1:30:21] upon you and put unction in your heart
[1:30:26] in your life your prayer is like active
[1:30:30] prayer your prayer is like charged
[1:30:33] prayer your prayer not going and with
[1:30:36] the new roof and bouncing back down
[1:30:37] that's not not that's not perfect
[1:30:38] unction when the pray of option is
[1:30:40] different
[1:30:41] Oh glory to God let me see if I can read
[1:30:43] it here for you what the holy was given
[1:30:45] for its second function to the preacher
[1:30:50] so I appreciate the preach without
[1:30:52] unction he could preach with enthusiasm
[1:30:54] he could preach with eloquence he could
[1:30:56] preach with intellect he could preach
[1:30:58] with knowledge but he doesn't have to
[1:30:59] have the unction the unction give the
[1:31:02] sermon wings the unction make the same
[1:31:05] one fly the unction make the service the
[1:31:08] service like I like the terminology
[1:31:10] worship leader so we're also leaders
[1:31:12] here we have worship leaders you know
[1:31:14] when they're sing they bring into
[1:31:15] worship atmosphere they don't have to
[1:31:17] sing the long time so and how it was and
[1:31:20] Scratchy and excuse the voice saints of
[1:31:22] God is true the voice another song sit
[1:31:24] down you have no voice leave the singers
[1:31:29] to sing hallelujah so the unction comes
[1:31:33] God reads the Holy Ghost the function to
[1:31:35] the preacher it's a gift is to give
[1:31:37] holiness to the group it's to set the
[1:31:40] church in order it's to bring a unity of
[1:31:43] spirit it is to unite us together with
[1:31:47] power but we can I shout than that
[1:31:51] Unitas would what with what with what
[1:31:55] that's for power gonna bring a unity or
[1:31:58] give the Lord a shout it is to unite us
[1:32:02] together with love brotherly love
[1:32:05] I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist
[1:32:07] Presbyterian Lutron whatever you are if
[1:32:10] we have been but if we have if we have
[1:32:12] been by one Holy Spirit baptized into
[1:32:15] one body and become a member of that
[1:32:16] body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:17] there was nothing present nothing future
[1:32:19] hunger starvation nothing can separate
[1:32:22] us from the love of God the love of
[1:32:24] Christ the love of God that's in Christ
[1:32:25] because we are born of his spirit washed
[1:32:28] in his blood
[1:32:28] we a new creature that is what the Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost was given for now free the judge
[1:32:35] among the Kohi in this group or that
[1:32:36] group or young to this church is a pen
[1:32:38] across studies the Baptist is your
[1:32:39] witness he kept talk to them known as
[1:32:41] nobody who's given for I don't get that
[1:32:42] your witness Baptist you treat them with
[1:32:44] love you see them with grease you see

[1:33:31] to be born just exactly the father and
[1:33:34] mother was born of this theory that's
[1:33:36] what makes a man a new person is because
[1:33:39] he's born again reborn his first birth
[1:33:43] brings him a natural man on it his
[1:33:45] second birth brings him a spiritual man
[1:33:47] of him
[1:33:47] it changes him his soul not his outward
[1:33:54] conscience but his oak always outward in
[1:33:59] his senses he still feels he still smell
[1:34:02] indecent here but his inward parts his
[1:34:06] desires what motivates him has been
[1:34:10] changed to God that has nothing to do
[1:34:17] with coming to church that has to do
[1:34:20] with in a chain a one thing that was
[1:34:24] sharing believers and to ask them and
[1:34:26] our state back here now the scripture

[1:48:15] not just went but a man that was sent by
[1:48:19] God and God has a man that has sent God
[1:48:23] send them out and when that sentiment is
[1:48:25] an old power with revelation with
[1:48:28] knowledge with Authority with wisdom or
[1:48:30] glory but understanding with excellent
[1:48:33] spirit oh give the Lord a shallow river
[1:48:36] but these men will be a class act
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:44] let me show you another reason why Satan
[1:48:48] hates this book of revelation of Jesus
[1:48:50] Christ in the church but with the two
[1:48:52] books it's on his Genesis and revelation
[1:48:54] he was not a reader bokya how will
[1:48:57] Horace
[1:48:59] people like to read Psalms
[1:49:03] Lois my shepherd I shall not want
[1:49:05] that's very good hallelujah praise the
[1:49:09] Lord all ye people hallelujah praise
[1:49:11] Allah with timbrel and prison madhhabs
[1:49:13] and playing along someone stimulates
[1:49:15] arms when you see revelation and Genesis
[1:49:18] as problems to the devil because Genesis
[1:49:21] identifying his beginning and Revelation
[1:49:23] proves him off you shall be shortened
[1:49:30] under
[1:49:33] all these devil friend afraid of me
[1:49:35] afterwards even afraid of Memorial Oh
[1:49:37] the Bible said afterwards when you see
[1:49:39] me say is this the man that cos he must
[1:49:42] make nation to tremble is this yes is
[1:49:45] this the man that caused Nations to a
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:02] let's continue
[1:50:03] he knows this is devil that Jesus Christ
[1:50:07] has seen yesterday didn't fail and he
[1:50:09] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:50:13] more than to ninety percent of
[1:50:15] theologians
[1:50:16] he knows that since God is immutable in
[1:50:19] his nature which is unchangeable in his
[1:50:21] nature
[1:50:22] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[1:50:24] thus Satan knows assuredly that you
[1:50:27] original Church at Pentecost with the
[1:50:32] power of God mark 16 in action we read
[1:50:38] that script yesterday is the true church
[1:50:41] that Jesus claimed as his own all else
[1:50:44] is false 10% say Amen that harmony with
[1:50:50] any message you know this church near
[1:50:53] with sin mark 16 in action is the true
[1:50:57] church
[1:50:59] I am the essay a church you believe the
[1:51:05] Prophet earlier and they said that they
[1:51:07] say that here you know
[1:51:08] a church with sin mark 16 an action may
[1:51:11] be seated
[1:51:12] what does in max action action the Lord
[1:51:14] Himself went everywhere with them
[1:51:17] confirming the word with signs following
[1:51:25] that's what the fathers had that's what
[1:51:28] the fathers are the Lord Himself 1st
[1:51:31] Thessalonians 4 what happened the Lord
[1:51:33] Himself descends from heaven with a
[1:51:36] shout revelation 10:1 what happens
[1:51:39] I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:51:40] from heaven cool with a cloud with a

[1:52:15] before God was God because he ain't just
[1:52:19] make him God when the end I began to
[1:52:21] worship and he became God but before he
[1:52:23] became God glory to God he put your name
[1:52:27] in his thinking in his thoughts he put
[1:52:31] your name there and you don't wanna

[2:26:41] revealing his works he knows this is
[2:26:44] devil knows if the people get the true
[2:26:49] revelation of the true church and what
[2:26:53] she is
[2:26:54] remember what Jesus taught Peter right
[2:26:56] Peter said about the Christ
[2:26:57] suddenly thank God he's the flesh and
[2:26:59] blood has not revealed unto you but my
[2:27:00] father has revealed unto you and upon
[2:27:03] this rock I will be my church my church
[2:27:04] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[2:27:06] against it in other words wrestle with
[2:27:08] but not conquer it no no so therefore
[2:27:10] the church is not man's Church is that
[2:27:13] th church is Jesus church and that
[2:27:15] church is built by Revelation this
[2:27:17] building is not the church you are not
[2:27:19] the church the revelation is what he
[2:27:21] built it on and that revelation is put
[2:27:23] into people so when he put this
[2:27:24] revelation in you he little devil can't
[2:27:26] conquer you we could wrassle with you he
[2:27:28] can flip you over he can rust on the

[2:27:43] rock I will build my church and the
[2:27:45] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[2:27:47] it no this is Peter getting a revelation
[2:27:49] that Jesus identify is from the father
[2:27:51] next five minutes Jesus I'm gonna
[2:27:54] crucify me they said no no Lord and you
[2:27:56] say get be a visitor he just never ever

[2:28:28] because Jesus identifying his destiny
[2:28:31] which is to die to pay the price to get
[2:28:33] the book to release the other names
[2:28:35] he himself calm down and that pen to
[2:28:37] call these sons names other names have
[2:28:39] to be called and they can only recall
[2:28:43] from the book when he was until he was
[2:28:45] the book that's why he brought to the
[2:28:51] woman of the world and wait for Hadiya
[2:28:53] because he has a name so he could
[2:28:59] release her from her condition because
[2:29:02] he had a name but once he died he rose
[2:29:05] up to get the pulpit all the names he
[2:29:07] sent a prophet to open the book release
[2:29:11] the names seven spirits more evil

[2:30:10] means a army that cannot be defeated
[2:30:12] hallelujah
[2:30:13] if they get a true revelation of the two
[2:30:15] spirits within the framework of the
[2:30:18] Christian Church so that's another level

[2:39:14] short no flesh shall be saved because
[2:39:21] the Serpent's Eve multiplying all these
[2:39:23] sodomites and the evil spirits but David
[2:39:29] here was telling me in school they

[2:40:18] be able to obey their laws
[2:40:21] [Applause]
[2:40:23] let me say that again let me say again
[2:40:26] call your gadget the reason why
[2:40:29] eventually they will have to shut down
[2:40:31] the church this church and other
[2:40:33] churches like it is because we will not
[2:40:35] be able to cope with their loss it will
[2:40:39] be enforceable to United Nations who is
[2:40:42] written on dynamics to us unforced
[2:40:44] Lucifer's agenda for the entire world
[2:40:48] hallelujah

[2:41:13] the Lord I show no laws as popping

[2:41:55] [Applause]
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:58] [Applause]
[2:42:01] if they get a true revelation of the two
[2:42:05] spirits within the frame of the
[2:42:07] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[2:42:11] watch design and withstand the
[2:42:15] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[2:42:18] powerless before her he will be
[2:42:20] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[2:42:23] which stood him his very effort to gain
[2:42:25] power over him in a desert Satan hates
[2:42:28] revelation but we love it will true
[2:42:31] revelation in our lives the gates of
[2:42:34] Hell cannot prevail against us but we
[2:42:38] will prevail over them so in other words
[2:42:42] he's not saying play defense
[2:42:45] he said play attack not only will never
[2:42:49] prevail against us but we will prevail
[2:42:50] over against them so they're not
[2:42:52] blocking again you're blocking on every
[2:42:54] block him block him block and know this
[2:42:55] when you come back you say enough is
[2:42:58] enough I'm going to take back from the
[2:43:01] devil what he took from me because we
[2:43:05] have a promise no divine revelation give
[2:43:07] us the authority to take back from the
[2:43:10] devil to pre-fall over the enemy but I'm
[2:43:13] talking about a man you may be seated
[2:43:15] it was drought so main Texas fall and
[2:43:19] they couldn't get water what and that
[2:43:20] man went even middle of the street shop
[2:43:23] down on his knees grease up his hands
[2:43:25] all man he said Lord God I serve you all
[2:43:29] these years sand on rim they said in
[2:43:32] know when that man dropped down on his
[2:43:34] knees in the middle street and asked
[2:43:36] offering this a new marine was coming
[2:43:38] afterwards our bunch Irena Turner means
[2:43:40] that they come because one man decide to
[2:43:42] punish these and prayer before court and
[2:43:44] ask god I'd serve you all these years or
[2:43:47] glory that God send on that ring
[2:43:49] Oh hallelujah when you ready to get God
[2:43:52] you will get God when you ready for
[2:43:54] preacher you won't get a brick true
[2:43:55] people do what they want to do if you
[2:43:57] have to get up late in the morning a
[2:43:59] fiber clock and the other check-in for a
[2:44:00] clock you'll be there for 4 o'clock
[2:44:02] because you don't want to miss that
[2:44:03] flight you'll want to walk in your list
[2:44:04] and anyway you want because it's not a
[2:44:06] burden to you yet but if you understand
[2:44:09] this is the house of God if you're
[2:44:10] understand you come to worship if you're
[2:44:12] understanding from the Creator
[2:44:13] atmosphere if you're understand know
[2:44:14] minocycline revival is that the people
[2:44:16] to bring revival if you understand that
[2:44:18] then you come in here to create
[2:44:20] something not to watch what's happening
[2:44:22] but the cause something to happen then
[2:44:24] your whole attitude and thinking and
[2:44:25] behavior becomes different then you want
[2:44:28] to be a participator you want to be
[2:44:30] involved in what happened in the church
[2:44:31] but they looking for fire to fall
[2:44:33] looking for the sick to be healed you
[2:44:35] looking with a blind to see the Deaf to
[2:44:37] hear I and I can't continue
[2:44:56] 19:33 God give around 7 visions which is
[2:44:59] just must come to pass before Jesus
[2:45:02] comes again it almost appears as if
[2:45:08] there's only what to left of that vision
[2:45:12] the last one America was bombed up
[2:45:15] craters not even sure of America will
[2:45:18] make the determination Russia have the
[2:45:22] bombs to handle America and Rome and
[2:45:24] other places it's already built just a
[2:45:27] matter time one of the North were
[2:45:30] divisions do was the one in which he saw
[2:45:33] the children in cars that has been
[2:45:36] controlled by remote there was no
[2:45:39] steering wheel at that time anything was
[2:45:43] wrong at that time cars were square
[2:45:45] there's no way you could imagine this
[2:45:47] thing on what not because what the
[2:45:48] vision is a vision is a profit goal in
[2:45:52] the future
[2:45:53] take a snapshot come back in the present
[2:45:56] and said thus here the Lord it's not
[2:46:00] what he's trying to bring the past is
[2:46:02] what already is because in heaven is
[2:46:06] already stretched out it's like the
[2:46:12] novel a book you could open the book
[2:46:15] read the beginning and middle if the
[2:46:18] other is a mystery book and somebody's
[2:46:21] tall and you're wondering who stole it
[2:46:23] you start the playing games with the
[2:46:25] pictures and the characters you could
[2:46:26] spin he was just fast fast fast and say
[2:46:27] gokokuji not still yet to kill this
[2:46:30] story he closed the book but you are
[2:46:33] outside the book you can go in any part
[2:46:37] of this story the beginning party and
[2:46:39] then party middle part
[2:46:40] well quarters like that he's outside the
[2:46:42] book so when the prophets flipped the
[2:46:44] pages and see destruction is not maybe
[2:46:48] it will happen he see Los Angeles sink
[2:46:51] and a part of a desert become a port
[2:46:53] city thousands of people will die he saw
[2:46:59] it but guess what he saw bright
[2:47:04] walking in step he saw you he said I see
[2:47:10] the brightest cold
[2:47:11] she's stealing to the kingdom of God so
[2:47:17] he saw you delivered he saw you sealed
[2:47:20] [Music]
[2:47:22] sealed yes revelation 7 I saw another
[2:47:27] mighty angel ascend from the east having
[2:47:29] the seal of the Living God and he was
[2:47:31] sent to see the hundred and forty-four
[2:47:32] thousand Jews from this tribe and that
[2:47:35] job and that tribe but before them Jews
[2:47:37] are sealed
[2:47:37] there's a bride to be sealed because God
[2:47:40] cut off the Jews to come to the Gentiles
[2:47:42] no calls about a color the Gentiles to
[2:47:44] go back to the Jews so time is running
[2:47:47] out on the Gentiles or glory the courts
[2:47:50] of course and a last message before the
[2:47:52] great and terrible day of the Lord
[2:47:53] hallelujah send a messenger before the
[2:47:57] great and terrible day to turn your
[2:47:58] hands back not to argue we right

[2:50:37] this is the last message before
[2:50:41] destruction let me see it again
[2:50:44] this message that we are preaching that
[2:50:46] we are believe in is the last message
[2:50:49] before destruction
[2:50:53] destruction is coming the Prophet said
[2:50:56] the seven seals book is revealed at the
[2:50:58] tying of the seven thunders of
[2:51:00] Revelation 10 he had in his hand a book
[2:51:04] open and here it was closed back there
[2:51:06] and sealed and his open has been opened
[2:51:08] since that time of the season we are
[2:51:10] getting into the night the book is open
[2:51:12] now you see the mystery of this 7 C book
[2:51:16] will be revealed at the sounding of the
[2:51:18] seventh which in this message the 70s
[2:51:21] are being in the song and there's the
[2:51:23] messages wrote here we got it in TP and
[2:51:26] book form now at the beginning of the
[2:51:29] song of the message the miss of God
[2:51:31] should be finished at that time now we
[2:51:33] will notice the book of the mystery of
[2:51:35] God is not revealed until the seventh
[2:51:38] angels messages sounded these points
[2:51:41] will be important in the seals cause it
[2:51:44] must tie together
[2:51:45] it has wrote mysterious because Norman
[2:51:48] Owen knows it
[2:51:49] God alone Jesus Christ but it's a book a
[2:51:53] mysterious book it's a book of
[2:51:55] redemption I know we know that this book
[2:51:58] of redemption will not be totally
[2:51:59] understood it's pure for sixty teachers
[2:52:02] but at the end when the seven either
[2:52:04] begin the song this mystery he winds up
[2:52:07] all the loose ends that these fellows
[2:52:09] prove that and the mysteries come down
[2:52:13] from God as is the Word of God and
[2:52:16] reveals the entire revelation of God the
[2:52:20] mysteries come known as what as the Word
[2:52:23] of God so if the world is preached the
[2:52:26] mysteries are being preaching because
[2:52:28] the mystery itself comes down as the
[2:52:30] world now watch this you know watch no
[2:52:33] you see I'm not making that up
[2:52:35] that's it Stasi as a lord I read it to
[2:52:38] you out of the book the showman of the
[2:52:40] seven angels message the mystery of God
[2:52:42] shall be finished that are being cleared
[2:52:44] by his holy prophets
[2:52:45] that's the prophets who wrote the world
[2:52:46] at the Shonan of the seven church age
[2:52:49] the last church age that's where we are
[2:52:52] all the loose ends through these church
[2:52:56] ages have been proved that will be wound
[2:52:58] up together
[2:52:59] and when the seals are broke and the
[2:53:02] mysteries revealed don't come the angel
[2:53:05] the messenger Christ set in his foot
[2:53:07] upon the land upon the sea with a
[2:53:09] rainbow over his head
[2:53:10] now remember this seventh angel is a it
[2:53:13] at the time of his coming
[2:53:14] oh praise be to Jesus and we realize in
[2:53:18] the scripture over in Malachi 4 there's
[2:53:21] to be one like John and Elijah to whom
[2:53:23] the Word of God can come to and he is to
[2:53:26] reveal there we go by the Holy Spirit
[2:53:28] all the missions of God and restore the
[2:53:32] fate of the children back to the feet of
[2:53:34] the apostolate fathers restore all these
[2:53:37] mysteries that have been proved all
[2:53:38] these River I'm done for now but listen
[2:53:42] to this inclusion when Adam fell Adam
[2:53:49] fell from the image of God and on
[2:53:53] disobedience throwing off the image so I
[2:53:56] don't fell from the holy deal because
[2:53:59] they didn't even know they were naked
[2:54:01] because they were filled with the Holy
[2:54:03] Ghost that was hid from them do you do
[2:54:07] you get that when Adam eyes was open
[2:54:10] because of break in the world then he
[2:54:13] understood they were naked and adamant
[2:54:16] and put on fig leaves to cover himself
[2:54:18] when God came down in the evening time
[2:54:21] to talk to Adam as usual and say Adam
[2:54:23] where are you where I could see in your
[2:54:25] way as opposed to me he said I'm here hi
[2:54:27] didn't I Nick I saw him it he said who
[2:54:29] told you you were naked
[2:54:31] we got a revolution from I revealed that
[2:54:34] I unfolded oh you get that did you take
[2:54:36] off the tree tonight do another detail

[2:54:44] sort of flip the script Eve said II
[2:54:47] discipline deceive me and Gordon talk
[2:54:50] disciplined next God threw them on the
[2:54:56] Eden put God's wrong The Tree of Life
[2:54:59] and dragged them out and that's how man
[2:55:03] become a wanderer
[2:55:04] but in that God put a plan immediately
[2:55:08] more
[2:55:09] to bring Batman back to Eden the devil
