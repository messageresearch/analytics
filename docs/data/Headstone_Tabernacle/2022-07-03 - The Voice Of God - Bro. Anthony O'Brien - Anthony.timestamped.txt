[47:13] amen reading from verses 1 to 3 says in
[47:16] the beginning god created the heaven
[47:18] and the earth
[47:19] and the earth was without form and void
[47:21] and darkness was upon the face of the
[47:23] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[47:26] the face of the waters
[47:28] and god said
[47:29] let there be light
[47:31] and there was light
[47:33] god our blessing and also uh
[47:36] thessalonians
[47:38] uh four and and versus sixteen
[47:43] sixteen to eighteen
[47:45] says for the lord himself shall descend
[47:47] from heaven with a shout
[47:49] with the voice of the archangel
[47:51] and with the trump of god
[47:53] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[47:56] then we which are alive and remain
[47:59] shall be caught up together with them
[48:00] and the clouds to meet the lord in the
[48:02] air
[48:03] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[48:05] wherefore comfort one another with these
[48:08] words

[50:59] bless you saints of god well it's
[51:00] certainly happy to be in the house of
[51:01] the lord today
[51:03] amen and i have a small thought i want
[51:04] to share with you this morning
[51:06] and my thought is the voice of god
[51:09] amen that's my thought this morning amen
[51:13] the voice of god
[51:15] and you know i was thinking
[51:18] about
[51:20] when i was a younger person
[51:22] um being a teenager
[51:24] growing up and
[51:26] thinking back through those years you
[51:27] know there was always something that
[51:30] was in my mind at that time and i uh
[51:33] as a younger person
[51:36] there's a strange sense of
[51:38] not being heard
[51:41] um
[51:42] you know
[51:42] you feel like you have a voice but
[51:46] you know because of the way the world
[51:48] works sometimes your voice gets lost
[51:51] amidst all the other voices
[51:54] that are around
[51:56] sometimes you have feelings and thoughts
[51:58] opinions on things that you want to
[51:59] share
[52:00] with people but maybe because you're not
[52:02] old enough
[52:04] or you're not experienced enough
[52:06] or you know how the hierarchy of the
[52:08] world works sometimes your
[52:10] little young voice
[52:12] gets lost amidst all the other voices
[52:14] that
[52:15] have uh you know societal status
[52:18] background
[52:19] based on where you come from
[52:21] other voices are revered and respected
[52:23] more than yours
[52:25] that's just the way the world works
[52:27] and it's tough
[52:28] you're in a class of probably 15 20 kids
[52:30] and the teacher says anybody asks a
[52:33] question and everybody raises their hand
[52:34] because they want to be heard
[52:37] and sometimes teacher doesn't have all
[52:38] the time to answer all the questions
[52:40] maybe he just answers two or three
[52:42] and you're left with your question
[52:45] sometimes that's just how it is
[52:47] because maybe a certain age and
[52:50] you know you just feel like you get lost
[52:52] and i could see how a lot of young
[52:53] people can that can get lost along the
[52:55] way
[52:57] sometimes they join gangs and
[52:59] sometimes they join small groups clubs
[53:03] sometimes they get caught up in any kind
[53:04] of platform that would give them a voice
[53:08] somewhere where they could be heard
[53:10] where their concerns could be raised and
[53:12] where someone there would be able to
[53:14] address it
[53:15] maybe it's a community leader
[53:18] or someone with some kind of influence
[53:21] amen in their society and somehow they
[53:23] feel that this is the way that they can
[53:24] be heard sometimes they get caught up in
[53:26] the wrong thing
[53:28] and sometimes i think
[53:30] you know and maybe an admonishment here
[53:32] as we as parents we ought to really keep
[53:34] a listening ear for children
[53:37] because sometimes there's things they
[53:38] want to tell us
[53:40] and if we're listening we'll hear
[53:42] we'll hear them out we'll hear their
[53:44] their concerns
[53:46] what they're trying to tell us
[53:48] because they'll become a time when we
[53:50] want to speak to them
[53:52] and they won't have time for us
[53:55] so we want to make time for them
[53:57] and to make sure that
[53:59] any question that they have is answered
[54:01] answered with guidance and with
[54:02] leadership
[54:04] answered with the right spirit and
[54:05] motive and objective to be answered by
[54:07] the word of god isn't that right because
[54:10] that's how we are admonished to lead our
[54:11] homes and to lead our families isn't
[54:13] that right
[54:14] praise god so i just thought about this
[54:16] thing about voices
[54:18] and
[54:20] just the same way that you have a voice
[54:22] and you want to be heard
[54:24] god has a voice also
[54:27] and he wants to be heard
[54:29] just the same as you
[54:30] praise god amen hallelujah we live
[54:33] an age now where there's so many voices
[54:36] and the internet and and you know
[54:38] youtube and different platforms have
[54:39] given people a voice and i've allowed
[54:42] them to express their concerns to
[54:44] express their ideas express their
[54:47] opinions express what matters to them or
[54:49] what's real to them or what their focus
[54:52] is or what they think about the world
[54:54] and i could imagine that with more
[54:56] voices being added every day there are
[54:58] millions upon millions of voices around
[55:00] the world of different people young old
[55:03] praise god of different uh persuasions
[55:06] with their own voices going across the
[55:08] world right now even as we speak people
[55:10] are making new videos uploading new
[55:12] uploading new content talking about this
[55:14] talking about that more voices are being
[55:16] added
[55:17] and the more voices that are being added
[55:19] is a more that it drowns out the real
[55:21] voice
[55:22] that we come to hear this morning which
[55:25] is the voice of god
[55:27] so this morning is a challenge praise
[55:29] god for us to get aside from everything
[55:31] else
[55:32] to shut out every other voice i can
[55:35] imagine no wonder the prophet would get
[55:36] away up into the mountains get away up
[55:39] into the forest get away up into the far
[55:41] away places and sometimes he would go
[55:43] hunting praise god pray he'd enjoy that
[55:46] but there was a great uh of secret in
[55:49] there where he would be able to hear
[55:51] from the lord
[55:53] you have to shut out every other channel
[55:55] every other distraction every other
[55:58] persuasion every other thing that's
[56:00] pulling you down in order to hear the
[56:02] voice of god
[56:04] amen isn't that right
[56:06] isn't that right
[56:08] and i i believe ministers are challenged
[56:10] today praise god to shout out every
[56:12] other voice in order to hear the voice
[56:14] of god speaking to us
[56:16] it's the only way to hear it
[56:18] isn't that right because god is a spirit
[56:22] and he has a desire
[56:23] and there's something he wants to do
[56:26] every day god has an objective when you
[56:30] wake up in the morning you have to find
[56:32] out what is god's objective
[56:35] what is he trying to achieve today
[56:37] oh
[56:38] hallelujah isn't that right
[56:40] there's a purpose for your life
[56:42] otherwise you would not be here this
[56:44] morning but in order to find that
[56:46] purpose you have to seek first the
[56:49] kingdom of god
[56:50] amen seek first his will seek first his
[56:54] desire seek first his motive seek first
[56:57] is objective for your life and then all
[57:00] other things will be added unto you
[57:03] oh don't worry about your pills don't
[57:06] worry about your car don't worry about
[57:07] your house god will take care of
[57:09] everything else if you seek first the
[57:12] one thing
[57:13] oh david said
[57:15] one thing have i desired and that will i
[57:18] seek after that i may dwell
[57:21] in the house of the lord all my days and
[57:25] inquire in his temple
[57:27] oh and behold the beauty of the lord for
[57:30] in a time of trouble
[57:32] he shall hide me in his pavilion in a
[57:36] secret place he shall hide me and he
[57:40] shall set me up upon a rock and when my
[57:44] heart is overwhelmed lead me
[57:47] to the rock that is higher than i
[57:50] lead me
[57:52] to the rock of my salvation lead me
[57:55] to the rock of ages this morning oh
[57:58] somebody say man
[58:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so are
[58:05] you ready for the word this morning you
[58:08] have a voice
[58:09] i have a voice but god also has a voice
[58:13] amen and a voice what is it it's an
[58:15] expression of a person
[58:17] oh hallelujah isn't that right it's you
[58:20] have a unique voice praise god you have
[58:22] something to answer it if a question is
[58:25] asked to you isn't that right oh holly
[58:27] you can answer with your voice you can
[58:30] make a loud noise with your voice you
[58:32] could praise god with your voice you can
[58:34] testify of his goodness with your voice
[58:37] you could tell the devil no with your
[58:39] voice you can make a stand with your
[58:42] force you can let your desires be made
[58:45] known this morning with a loud voice
[58:48] with your hands raised you could offer a
[58:50] sacrifice or praise this morning because
[58:53] you have a voice don't let the devil
[58:55] tell you that you don't have a voice i
[58:58] don't care how young you are god still
[59:00] hears you this morning i don't care how
[59:02] old you feel
[59:04] god still hears you this morning he
[59:06] hears every cry he hears every voice and
[59:10] he's here to answer every call this
[59:13] morning oh somebody say man
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:19] [Music]
[59:23] a voice is an expression
[59:26] of who you are
[59:27] it's the ability to utter speech
[59:29] the expression of words
[59:31] isn't that right
[59:32] and we know a word
[59:34] starts off as a thought
[59:36] and then it becomes a word express
[59:38] that's your voice expressing the
[59:40] thoughts that was in your minds
[59:42] previously praise god but once it's
[59:44] expressed it can't go back to being a
[59:47] thought it's not a word it's not
[59:49] expression praise god hey it's your
[59:52] voice being heard isn't that right your
[59:54] voice is an expression of you
[59:57] isn't that right
[59:58] the bible says a good man
[1:00:00] out of the good treasure of his heart
[1:00:02] this is luke 6
[1:00:03] bringing forth that which is good
[1:00:06] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:00:08] of his heart bringing forth that which
[1:00:10] is evil
[1:00:11] for the abundance for also the abundance
[1:00:13] of the heart his mouth speak it
[1:00:16] oh isn't that right
[1:00:18] hallelujah it's a voice being being made
[1:00:20] known praise god and it comes from what
[1:00:23] is in your heart then that voice speaks
[1:00:26] as an expression of what is in your
[1:00:28] heart oh what is in your heart this
[1:00:30] morning do you want a breakthrough do
[1:00:32] you want a deliverance do you need
[1:00:34] strength do you feel weak
[1:00:36] then make your voice known this morning
[1:00:39] oh hallelujah in this tabernacle in this
[1:00:41] place take the opportunity to make your
[1:00:44] voice known this morning to put in your
[1:00:46] request this morning don't stay silent
[1:00:49] the devil's job is to put a trip trap on
[1:00:52] your mouth and clam it so that you can't
[1:00:55] praise god so that you can't testify of
[1:00:57] his goodness to make you feel like you
[1:00:59] don't have a voice but god hears every
[1:01:02] voice this morning every voice in this
[1:01:05] room every voice on the internet every
[1:01:07] voice around the world can be heard by
[1:01:10] god god is not tired he is not wary
[1:01:14] there's nothing too hard for him he can
[1:01:17] satisfy your need
[1:01:19] according to his riches in glory
[1:01:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:27] glory to god
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:31] god has a voice
[1:01:32] he has a desire
[1:01:34] he had a purpose
[1:01:36] he had something he wanted to do
[1:01:38] that's why when we read genesis 1
[1:01:41] amen we see the earth spinning in
[1:01:42] confusion we see the earth spinning in
[1:01:45] darkness and because of who god is
[1:01:48] and the voice carries the nature
[1:01:51] and the character of god
[1:01:53] that voice had power in it
[1:01:55] isn't that right so what did he do
[1:01:58] because he had a purpose because he had
[1:02:00] something he wanted to achieve
[1:02:02] he expressed it
[1:02:03] he spoke the voice
[1:02:05] isn't that right and that voice carries
[1:02:07] the nature and character of god that
[1:02:09] voice had power in it because god has
[1:02:12] power
[1:02:13] that voice has a power to heal because
[1:02:15] god is a healer that voice had can
[1:02:17] deliver because god himself is a
[1:02:19] deliverer his voice and him is the same
[1:02:23] [Applause]
[1:02:25] oh
[1:02:27] when he speaks his word is the same oh
[1:02:30] hallelujah there's no misalignment
[1:02:32] there's no in between praise god
[1:02:35] he is
[1:02:36] his own expression isn't that right
[1:02:38] so he said let there be light
[1:02:40] and the bible said there was light
[1:02:42] praise god amen because the creator
[1:02:45] hallelujah who was thinking his thoughts
[1:02:47] finally spoke
[1:02:48] and for the first time this dark and
[1:02:51] confused world heard the voice of god oh
[1:02:55] hallelujah i don't care how dark and
[1:02:57] confused you feel in your mind
[1:02:59] all you have to hear this morning is the
[1:03:02] voice of god or to crack past the
[1:03:06] darkness in your mind
[1:03:08] oh to go past the demons pass your flesh
[1:03:11] pass your feelings pass what your hurts
[1:03:14] oh hallelujah and speak to your heart
[1:03:16] this morning
[1:03:19] oh
[1:03:20] hallelujah somebody's saying man
[1:03:23] [Applause]
[1:03:25] whatever was happening around
[1:03:27] had to come into obedience to that voice
[1:03:31] isn't that right
[1:03:33] your voice
[1:03:34] is an expression of who you are
[1:03:36] isn't that right that's why when jacob
[1:03:39] was wrestling with the angel
[1:03:41] isn't that right all night long to the
[1:03:43] breaking of the day
[1:03:44] the angel tell him i have to leave
[1:03:46] it's getting late

[1:06:44] in the storm you know the story praise
[1:06:46] god and disciples saw him coming far off
[1:06:48] they thought it was a ghost but when he

[1:06:52] peter got all fired up he said if that's
[1:06:54] you lord bid me come
[1:06:56] jesus said sure come and he began to
[1:06:58] come on the water isn't that right

[1:07:02] when he was in the boat praise god if
[1:07:05] that stupid become he's that kind of a
[1:07:06] guy isn't that right
[1:07:08] real zealous kind of person amen praise
[1:07:10] god we know him amen praise god when he
[1:07:12] come out the boat and you see what
[1:07:14] really going on and you see how hardy
[1:07:16] water was and how these storms was uh
[1:07:19] crashing all around on the thunder
[1:07:22] rolling and the rain falling isn't that
[1:07:24] right he began to sink he began to drown
[1:07:27] in the water hallelujah but he didn't
[1:07:29] stay silent one thing about love about
[1:07:32] peter he does not stay silent he always
[1:07:35] comes down a noise around him praise god
[1:07:37] hallelujah peter say praise save me lord
[1:07:41] i'm sinking
[1:07:42] oh he made his voice known pray peter
[1:07:46] was a fisherman peter gotta play style
[1:07:48] peter gotta make a little possible swim
[1:07:50] but he needed help because there's not
[1:07:52] normal conditions this is storm waters
[1:07:56] all over this thing there's over troyer
[1:07:58] stormed this mashup ship stormless
[1:08:00] mashup valley portal kind of thing he
[1:08:02] don't want to be destroyed he began to
[1:08:04] scream out and this morning you have a
[1:08:07] right as a christian as a son and as a
[1:08:11] daughter of god to scream out and say
[1:08:14] jesus
[1:08:15] save me
[1:08:19] i need your help
[1:08:21] i need your deliverance
[1:08:23] i need a breakthrough i need a reality i
[1:08:27] need the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:08:29] have a right
[1:08:31] somebody say man
[1:08:33] you have a right this morning
[1:08:36] to make your voice known
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:09:05] isn't that right
[1:09:07] the voice of god so therefore when adam
[1:09:09] spoke
[1:09:10] it wasn't a man speaking
[1:09:12] but it was a man under the authority of
[1:09:14] god
[1:09:15] speaking from his office
[1:09:17] in his position as a son of god in the
[1:09:20] kingdom
[1:09:21] speaking pray much remove
[1:09:24] do this do that praise god that was god
[1:09:26] that was the expression of adam who was
[1:09:28] a voice of god in adam
[1:09:30] speaking praise god because he was an
[1:09:32] attribute of the creator the creator
[1:09:34] hallelujah gave him the authority to
[1:09:37] speak and it was done to work amen is
[1:09:39] now right to move to do this to name the
[1:09:42] animals praise god that was the
[1:09:44] authority of god in adam
[1:09:46] speaking and when that voice was
[1:09:48] expressed there was an authority to back
[1:09:50] that up when that voice was expressed
[1:09:53] there was authority to back up the voice
[1:09:56] that was being spoken so when adam say
[1:09:58] lion lie don't hear an authority come
[1:10:01] down allow you to back that voice up
[1:10:05] hallelujah and the lion or paid and the
[1:10:08] lamb all paid
[1:10:10] and the lamb lay with the lion oh hell
[1:10:12] is that right
[1:10:13] because there was an authority there to
[1:10:16] keep the peace
[1:10:17] isn't that right
[1:10:18] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:10:20] the prophet said on we would see jesus
[1:10:22] he said now what is the word a word is a
[1:10:24] taught express
[1:10:26] he said you have to think it before you
[1:10:28] express it
[1:10:29] that's the reason jesus said unto the
[1:10:31] pharisees you hypocrites
[1:10:33] how can you say good and when and call
[1:10:35] me good and so forth when he knew that
[1:10:38] in their hearts they were thinking evil
[1:10:40] of him he said from the heart the mouth
[1:10:43] speak it from the heart isn't that right
[1:10:45] and we read the scripture just now right
[1:10:47] okay he said if you don't then it's your
[1:10:50] thoughts expressing themselves
[1:10:52] and you express something else
[1:10:55] see your thoughts and what you're saying
[1:10:57] he says is not an alignment
[1:10:59] you're thinking one thing
[1:11:01] and saying something else god can't
[1:11:03] honor that
[1:11:04] isn't that right
[1:11:05] prophet said then it's hypocrisy
[1:11:07] it's not come it isn't coming from your
[1:11:10] heart
[1:11:10] oh hallelujah so because adam had the
[1:11:12] right heart praise god because he was in
[1:11:15] the right condition when he spoke it was
[1:11:18] in alignment with his heart with the
[1:11:19] authority of god in him and an authority
[1:11:22] back that up
[1:11:23] back that voice up isn't that right oh
[1:11:26] my said so in the beginning was a word
[1:11:28] and a word was it god and the word was
[1:11:29] god it hadn't been expressed yet he said
[1:11:33] but then the word was made flesh and
[1:11:34] dwelt among us the word christ he said
[1:11:37] christ is a word
[1:11:39] now when he came unheard in the
[1:11:40] beginning was the word and the thought
[1:11:43] word and then the word once expressed in
[1:11:45] eden it became reality
[1:11:47] god cannot say anything
[1:11:50] and ever take it back
[1:11:52] i love that once it's done spoken
[1:11:56] so shall it be
[1:11:57] so if god said you are gonna be healed
[1:12:00] he cannot take it back if he said you're
[1:12:02] gonna be delivered he cannot take it
[1:12:04] back if he said he's gonna save your
[1:12:06] family he cannot take it back because
[1:12:09] it's already done spoken and so shall it
[1:12:13] be
[1:12:13] all the authority that is in that voice
[1:12:16] when he spoke it praise god i don't care
[1:12:19] how long it takes
[1:12:20] it's caught to come to pass and he can't
[1:12:23] take it back oh because he was perfect
[1:12:26] when he said it and it'll be perfect
[1:12:28] when it's done oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:31] god cannot lie
[1:12:33] oh i serve a living god this morning oh
[1:12:36] hallelujah how many happy
[1:12:38] how many glad today
[1:12:40] that the enemy is defeated you serve a
[1:12:42] victorious god who is able hallelujah to
[1:12:46] do exactly what he said he would do
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:54] oh my can't take it back
[1:12:56] he said that's why we base our hopes on
[1:12:58] god
[1:12:59] because god being infinite he cannot
[1:13:02] change
[1:13:03] oh yeah man he's the same yesterday
[1:13:04] today and forever isn't that right he
[1:13:06] said if i can say something today
[1:13:08] tomorrow i might think different next
[1:13:10] year i might be a lot smarter i can
[1:13:12] think different
[1:13:13] prophet said you can but not god
[1:13:16] every decision is perfect
[1:13:19] if god once says anything it's eternal
[1:13:23] that way
[1:13:24] and it can never be changed
[1:13:27] it isn't that right
[1:13:29] and now god uh that that's the real
[1:13:32] reason that jesus was the lamb of god
[1:13:34] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:13:36] because it was in god's thinking
[1:13:38] and when the word was expressed
[1:13:41] then it become flesh and dwelt among us
[1:13:43] he said oh i love that
[1:13:45] that gives me so much hope
[1:13:48] he said i love that because it gives the
[1:13:50] assurance
[1:13:52] that the great infinite god oh the god
[1:13:55] that stretches through all time and
[1:13:56] throughout space who has no beginning
[1:13:59] who has no end that great infinite god
[1:14:02] that we serve knowed all things and
[1:14:05] knowed us before the world was ever
[1:14:08] created oh somebody give him a shout out

[1:22:24] book of life from the foundation of the
[1:22:25] world
[1:22:26] god by his foreknowledge
[1:22:28] saw you comma
[1:22:32] oh glory
[1:22:33] put your name in his book
[1:22:36] and that's the reason you're here
[1:22:37] tonight the prophet said and that's the
[1:22:39] reason you're here this morning because
[1:22:41] god saw you
[1:22:43] he loved you and he took his own blood
[1:22:46] oh and wrote your name in a book and
[1:22:49] that's how you hear today
[1:22:50] oh the devil is already defeated oh
[1:22:54] glory to god

[1:23:02] because you've answered that call
[1:23:05] god for knew you and called you
[1:23:08] and you accepted his call and now you
[1:23:11] can see see he said every man seeks out
[1:23:13] his own salvation of fear and trembling
[1:23:15] he said i hope my name was among that
[1:23:17] because if it was
[1:23:18] my name having a work of life if it was
[1:23:20] put there before the foundation in the
[1:23:21] world when allah was slain
[1:23:24] for me in the thinking of god see he's
[1:23:26] infinite you don't just simply run a
[1:23:29] business haphazardly he said i don't run
[1:23:31] my business like that and you wouldn't
[1:23:33] do it yours see god doesn't his christ
[1:23:35] come to redeem those who god foresaw and
[1:23:38] for knew that he that would come to him
[1:23:41] he said aren't you glad you've come
[1:23:43] amen we could say amen this morning
[1:23:45] oh we're so glad we answered that call
[1:23:48] amen a call to life
[1:23:50] amen i want to know i want to know
[1:23:53] what god wants to say
[1:23:55] this morning do you feel that way
[1:23:57] amen amen how do we want to hear of his
[1:23:59] voice speak praise god we want to hear
[1:24:01] what he has to say to us isn't that
[1:24:02] right
[1:24:03] amen this is my personal note here every
[1:24:05] true servant needs to hear the voice of
[1:24:07] god
[1:24:08] the voice of god is thus saith the lord
[1:24:10] and the bride is promised to have thus
[1:24:13] said the lord will keep still
[1:24:14] amen so it's very important that we hear
[1:24:17] the voice of god isn't that right
[1:24:20] said what we need today the voice of god
[1:24:22] in the last days the prophet said in
[1:24:23] that great need
[1:24:24] and god has promised to meet the need of
[1:24:27] the hour he always does that and we need
[1:24:31] the voice of god
[1:24:32] today to meet the need of the hour isn't
[1:24:36] that right to meet the time that we're
[1:24:38] living in we just spoke about that right
[1:24:40] and after he has promised it we can rest
[1:24:43] assured that he will keep his promise
[1:24:46] that's the confidence that the believer
[1:24:48] has in his maker amen is not right that
[1:24:51] he will keep his promise he promised to
[1:24:54] heal you he will heal you he promised to
[1:24:56] deliver you he will deliver you he
[1:24:58] promised to restore you he will restore
[1:25:01] he will keep his promise
[1:25:03] oh
[1:25:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:08] trust in the lord with all your heart
[1:25:11] and lean not unto your own understanding
[1:25:13] oh hallelujah acknowledge him in all
[1:25:16] high ways
[1:25:18] he will direct thy paths
[1:25:20] amen make thy way straight isn't that
[1:25:22] right oh my
[1:25:24] that's the confidence that the believer
[1:25:26] has in his maker confidence
[1:25:29] isn't that right
[1:25:30] hallelujah
[1:25:32] praise god such confidence
[1:25:34] praise god you think about some of these
[1:25:35] guys walk around
[1:25:39] you give them a job to do and you pay
[1:25:40] them half because you're not sure that
[1:25:42] the job is going to be finished the way
[1:25:43] you want it
[1:25:45] when you're ready to pay them the other
[1:25:46] half
[1:25:47] so you just get them half just to make
[1:25:48] sure
[1:25:49] that they do what they promised they
[1:25:51] would do give it the next half when you
[1:25:53] finish
[1:25:55] but not with god
[1:25:56] you could trust everything into him
[1:25:59] because he's
[1:26:00] he's he's just that way
[1:26:03] you can have full confidence hallelujah
[1:26:05] you could put it all on god and he will
[1:26:08] reward you
[1:26:09] cast your bread upon the water oh don't
[1:26:12] you worry about tomorrow he can clothe
[1:26:16] the lily he can feed the sparrow his eye
[1:26:20] is on the spiral and i know
[1:26:23] he's watching over you this morning he's
[1:26:26] watching over me
[1:26:27] he will not leave his seat to beg bread
[1:26:30] i might be young and now i'm old and
[1:26:33] i've never seen david said the righteous
[1:26:35] forsaken oh hallelujah he will not
[1:26:38] forsake
[1:26:40] the ones that seek his face that seek
[1:26:42] his face oh he jacob lift up your hands
[1:26:46] oh hallelujah open up he gates and let
[1:26:49] the king of glory
[1:26:50] come riding in this morning
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:57] oh my
[1:26:59] praise god
[1:27:01] hallelujah that's the confidence he
[1:27:02] promised me the need and today one
[1:27:05] reason
[1:27:06] that the church is in the condition that
[1:27:07] is in
[1:27:08] is because there's so many voices
[1:27:11] so many other voices to attract the
[1:27:13] church
[1:27:14] from the voice of god
[1:27:15] till it's very doubtful that many would
[1:27:18] hear the voice of god though it spoke
[1:27:20] right in their midst
[1:27:21] oh that's a scary thing huh
[1:27:24] amen won't recognize it he said they
[1:27:26] perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[1:27:27] prophet said because it would be a
[1:27:29] foreign thing to them
[1:27:30] they've got themselves so much centered
[1:27:33] on the voices of the day
[1:27:35] isn't that right
[1:27:37] and if we notice in the scripture
[1:27:38] reading
[1:27:39] that the voice of god was foreign to
[1:27:41] them and it's become that way again
[1:27:43] today that the voice of god there's so
[1:27:46] many other voices
[1:27:48] and then if god promised he would give
[1:27:50] us that and if other voices are contrary
[1:27:53] to the voice of god then it must be the
[1:27:55] voice of our enemy to confuse us
[1:27:58] oh hallelujah anything that isn't the
[1:28:01] voice of god is the voice of the enemy
[1:28:04] it's a voice of some other thing trying
[1:28:06] to distract you trying to confuse trying
[1:28:09] to pervert because the devil is not a
[1:28:11] creator he's a perverter he's a pervert
[1:28:13] of the original so if the devil says
[1:28:15] anything how do you know he's lying
[1:28:18] every time he opens his mouth his voice
[1:28:20] is an expression of who he is and he's a
[1:28:22] liar so the devil will never tell you
[1:28:24] that you'll get the holy ghost the devil
[1:28:26] will never tell you that you can make it
[1:28:28] and if a voice is telling you that you
[1:28:30] cannot make it this morning then that is
[1:28:32] the devil because god would never say
[1:28:35] that that's not god's voice
[1:28:38] god's voice is always positive oh holy
[1:28:41] god's voice said go up at once
[1:28:43] take the land that i swear unto your
[1:28:45] fathers to give you a land flowing with
[1:28:48] milk and honey or to satisfy your needs
[1:28:52] oh according to his riches in glory
[1:28:57] hallelujah
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:01] oh my
[1:29:02] god
[1:29:03] isn't that right there's so many boys in
[1:29:05] here today see
[1:29:06] it's absolutely a hard thing
[1:29:09] because watch
[1:29:10] uh
[1:29:11] okay because it deadens the voice of the
[1:29:13] supernatural
[1:29:14] that's right
[1:29:15] i'll say that again there's so many
[1:29:17] voices here today that it's absolutely a
[1:29:19] hard thing because it deadens the voice
[1:29:22] of the supernatural
[1:29:24] oh so people are not even hearing what
[1:29:25] the spirit is saying because they have
[1:29:27] so many channels on oh helen have 98.10
[1:29:30] 97 points 96.445
[1:29:33] on in their head
[1:29:35] and they're sitting in church
[1:29:37] did i leave the stove on the little
[1:29:38] refrigerator the towel on did i pay this
[1:29:40] bill i'm not sure
[1:29:42] click click click clicking they say when
[1:29:44] you're younger your brain waves move
[1:29:47] very slowly because you're not agitated
[1:29:49] by the things of life it'll spike like
[1:29:51] this like how we are thinking did i do
[1:29:54] this did i do that
[1:29:55] i have to call the landlord
[1:29:58] they don't have those problems
[1:30:01] that's why they could learn spanish and
[1:30:03] french hunting because they just in that
[1:30:05] mindset
[1:30:06] but the older you get
[1:30:08] is more you have to manage
[1:30:10] so your mind is is crowded with all
[1:30:13] kinds of things
[1:30:15] and that's why i hear the prophet saying
[1:30:16] it's absolutely a hard thing because
[1:30:18] he's seeing the people and all of them
[1:30:20] have needs
[1:30:21] all of them have voices
[1:30:23] but there is one voice
[1:30:25] one singular voice that can address all
[1:30:28] those needs
[1:30:29] he's a man
[1:30:31] he has a prophet he might have the
[1:30:32] ability to hear certain things in the
[1:30:34] supernatural to hear the people their
[1:30:36] hearts their their what are their
[1:30:37] desires it all comes out in the
[1:30:39] supernatural i've never experienced it
[1:30:41] but the prophet talked about discernment
[1:30:42] and these things seeing pictures of
[1:30:44] people's lives and things that they've
[1:30:45] gone through it's i could imagine it's
[1:30:47] it's diverse
[1:30:49] the amount of issues and challenges that
[1:30:51] people have praise god and he's
[1:30:53] addressing them and there's so much
[1:30:55] because he's only one man and he's privy
[1:30:57] to understand and know certain things
[1:30:59] but he cannot help them he can't do
[1:31:01] anything about it he said you know who
[1:31:03] i'm waiting on i'm waiting on him praise
[1:31:06] god you know i can't do anything for you
[1:31:08] many people come up to the pulpit he say
[1:31:10] you know i can't heal you right he said
[1:31:12] i don't have the power to do it but he
[1:31:14] said there's someone here who can and
[1:31:15] and then he goes on ministering and said
[1:31:17] one jesus one time he was down by the
[1:31:19] pool of bethesda and he went past
[1:31:21] everybody but but there was one person
[1:31:23] that he wanted to touch and and and and
[1:31:26] he said only by made whole then all of a
[1:31:28] sudden the prophet break into a vision
[1:31:30] said i see a certain thing i i know
[1:31:32] what's wrong with you you come here
[1:31:33] because you have cancer i'll let you go
[1:31:35] out in the name of jesus and believe
[1:31:37] that he's healed you praise god oh
[1:31:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:42] [Applause]
[1:31:44] hallelujah
[1:31:46] god addressing the need
[1:31:48] and god knows your story this morning
[1:31:50] each one of us have stories each one of
[1:31:53] us have a walk a road that we traveling
[1:31:55] on my road might be all road your road
[1:31:58] might me brother so-and-so's wrote us a
[1:32:00] so-so
[1:32:01] some of you might be able to handle what
[1:32:03] brother so-and-so is doing some of you
[1:32:04] might be able to handle what sister so
[1:32:06] is going through
[1:32:07] but god knows what you're going through
[1:32:10] god knows your heart song
[1:32:12] in the night when you're all alone and
[1:32:15] you need help david said look into the
[1:32:18] hills from whence cometh my help my help
[1:32:21] cometh from the lord the lord which made
[1:32:24] heaven an itch he will not suffer that
[1:32:26] foot to be moved behold the lord that
[1:32:29] keepeth israel shall neither slumber he
[1:32:32] shall not sleep he is not asleep this
[1:32:35] morning he is very much awake he knows
[1:32:38] what you have need of make your voice
[1:32:40] known this morning and lift up your
[1:32:42] voice and let him know what you need
[1:32:45] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:51] there you hear my voice
[1:32:53] had not your heart amen oh my
[1:32:57] says uh
[1:32:58] there's so many intellectual voices
[1:33:00] voices of great voices of mighty men
[1:33:03] who are intellectual
[1:33:05] that in their intellectual conditions
[1:33:07] even then they shake the nations
[1:33:09] see
[1:33:12] so if you look at your eyes you see the
[1:33:13] fire the earthquake they get caught up
[1:33:17] intellectuals see
[1:33:18] they're just not overnight people the
[1:33:20] prophet said but they shake the nations
[1:33:22] they study their way into this thing
[1:33:24] break it great bringing great
[1:33:25] organization together great campaigns
[1:33:28] floweredly he said that a person would
[1:33:30] be a bit confused because obviously what
[1:33:32] they're seeing looks you know attractive
[1:33:34] isn't that right it's enough to confuse
[1:33:36] them and how these things go on and
[1:33:38] prosper prophecy
[1:33:42] isn't that right
[1:33:43] one time david said look at the heating
[1:33:44] rage and they're prospering and they're
[1:33:47] getting true
[1:33:48] and god saying yeah would you consider
[1:33:50] the end
[1:33:51] have you considered where they're going
[1:33:52] with that
[1:33:54] they're going on you know but the
[1:33:55] longest rope have i end
[1:33:57] oh when they're going to yank it
[1:34:00] wherever the tree leaning is that's
[1:34:02] where it will for
[1:34:03] isn't that right
[1:34:05] he said and there's voices that raise up
[1:34:07] and and do these things see and it
[1:34:09] causes the voice of god to be placed way
[1:34:12] back somewhere
[1:34:14] the true voice of god it's way back
[1:34:15] somewhere all we've got our churches
[1:34:17] we've got our things we've got our
[1:34:18] groups and then the voice of god gets
[1:34:20] less and less important isn't that right
[1:34:23] and the voice of god they say how will
[1:34:24] we know it's the voice of god the
[1:34:26] prophet said because for today it's a
[1:34:28] vindicated prophet
[1:34:30] but not uh but then she said uh
[1:34:33] he said oh we know it's a voice of god
[1:34:34] but today he said then it was a
[1:34:36] vindicated prophet now today how do we
[1:34:39] know it's a voice of god
[1:34:41] he said because it is a manifestation
[1:34:44] of the prophet's word oh hallelujah
[1:34:48] this is placed right in time back then
[1:34:50] we had a vindicated prophet but now that
[1:34:53] the prophet's gone what are we looking
[1:34:54] for what are we on expectation for a
[1:34:57] manifestation
[1:34:58] today 2020 2022 we're looking for
[1:35:02] manifestation
[1:35:04] of the prophet's word
[1:35:06] oh hallelujah
[1:35:09] this is god's prophet our true voice god
[1:35:12] only brings back that real come on now
[1:35:15] living
[1:35:16] supernatural god with his supernatural
[1:35:20] word hallelujah manifestation of true
[1:35:22] word and then we know that it's a voice
[1:35:24] of god because of that super word isn't
[1:35:26] that right he said there's so much in
[1:35:27] the other realms that almost dead that
[1:35:29] out but remember it'll glisten it'll
[1:35:31] come forth he said you know there's a
[1:35:33] voice today in the world of politics
[1:35:35] great voices and people absolutely
[1:35:37] there's it's all mixed up in the
[1:35:39] churches and everything
[1:35:40] and many times that we've just seen
[1:35:42] recently and that the voice of politics
[1:35:44] is actually stronger than the voice of
[1:35:45] god in the churches in the american
[1:35:48] people and so forth isn't that right
[1:35:49] they've done it amen
[1:35:51] isn't that right
[1:35:52] it's such a shame to see it the prophet
[1:35:54] said isn't that right okay
[1:35:56] now i want to get something here
[1:35:58] so the voice of god has authority in it
[1:36:01] isn't that right it has authority praise
[1:36:04] god because a voice is him when he
[1:36:06] speaks his authority speaks
[1:36:08] when he speaks his power speaks his
[1:36:11] omnipotence speaks it's an expression of
[1:36:13] him
[1:36:14] isn't that right and when the voice of
[1:36:15] god has failed in this last day brian it
[1:36:18] will be the voice of the archangel
[1:36:20] isn't that right the voice of the
[1:36:22] archangel is the bride's ministry
[1:36:25] the second part of 1st thessalonians 4
[1:36:26] which we read earlier isn't that right
[1:36:28] this ministry will be in the bride on
[1:36:30] the earth with the voice of god failed
[1:36:32] in her
[1:36:33] thundering out in sweetness thundering
[1:36:36] out in humility what will it be
[1:36:38] thousands of live voices
[1:36:40] all around the world
[1:36:42] speaking out isn't that right
[1:36:45] because we're nearing the end times
[1:36:47] hallelujah and the devil got his eyes on
[1:36:49] the bride but she has promised to have
[1:36:51] that voice
[1:36:53] amen you are promised to have that voice
[1:36:56] hey
[1:36:56] mary man hallelujah isn't that right
[1:36:59] moses when he was in the wilderness was
[1:37:01] tossed about and driven isn't arrived
[1:37:03] for 40 years in the desert however
[1:37:05] you're mining sheep mining praise god
[1:37:08] all goats and stuff like that praise god
[1:37:10] i had a man in his father's in law's
[1:37:12] flock praise god just pride in his time
[1:37:14] but one time he heard a burning bush he
[1:37:17] saw something that was different and he
[1:37:19] said let me go up and see and when he
[1:37:21] went up all of a sudden he heard a voice
[1:37:23] spoke to him
[1:37:25] something spoke to him out of that bush
[1:37:28] hallelujah something that you heard
[1:37:29] before hallelujah something he never saw
[1:37:31] before
[1:37:33] something he interacted with that was
[1:37:35] more real oh he said take his shoes from
[1:37:38] off your feet from where you're standing
[1:37:41] because this is holy ground because the
[1:37:43] holy god was on the mountain a holy god
[1:37:46] was in the bush our holy god was
[1:37:48] speaking to moses and when our holy god
[1:37:50] speaks to you
[1:37:52] you got to get yourself you got to wrap
[1:37:54] yourself in his presence you got to take
[1:37:56] off your shoes you got to show your
[1:37:58] reverence because god is in the building
[1:38:01] god is in your presence god is in your
[1:38:03] midst you can never be the same and come
[1:38:07] out of god's presence no no no no you've
[1:38:09] got to be changed you've got to be
[1:38:11] transformed because it's all powerful
[1:38:14] god has the ability to change you
[1:38:17] oh
[1:38:18] hallelujah
[1:38:21] oh
