[22:21] When the wicked, even my enemies and my
[22:23] foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[22:27] they stumbled and fell. Hallelujah.

[22:32] my heart shall not fear.
[22:35] Though war should rise against me, in
[22:39] this will I be confident.
[22:41] One thing have I desired of the Lord,
[22:44] that will I seek after, that I may dwell

[22:49] my life, to behold the beauty of the

[36:39] We're happy to be in the house of the
[36:41] Lord tonight.
[36:43] Amen. We thank God for his presence
[36:45] tonight. We thank God for the song
[36:46] service. We appreciate brother Steve
[36:48] Moli.
[36:50] Thank God for the atmosphere tonight.
[36:53] Amen. It's good to be here. So God bless
[36:56] you. Thank you so much. Uh brother
[36:58] Gideon over the music. And we just want
[37:00] to turn to our Bibles now as we want to
[37:04] go to the word portion of the service
[37:05] tonight. And let's just turn to Genesis
[37:08] chapter 41
[37:10] and we want to read from uh verse 29-32
[37:15] inclusively. Okay. So as you begin to
[37:18] find it, praise God.
[37:23] Genesis chapter 41.
[37:27] Praise God.
[37:31] Genesis 41 and
[37:34] we want to read from verse 29.
[37:37] to 32. Okay.
[37:45] And in this passage of scripture,
[37:49] just for a context, this is Joseph
[37:52] addressing Pharaoh
[37:54] concerning the dream that he had.
[37:58] And verse 29 says, "Behold, there come
[38:01] seven years of great plenty
[38:05] throughout all the land of Egypt, and
[38:09] there shall arise after them seven years
[38:12] of famine, and all the plenty shall be
[38:15] forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the
[38:19] famine shall consume the land,
[38:23] and the plenty shall not be known in the
[38:25] land by reason of that famine following,
[38:30] for it shall be very grievious.
[38:34] And for that the dream uh was doubled
[38:37] unto Pharaoh twice.
[38:39] It is because the thing is established
[38:42] by God, and God will shortly bring it to
[38:47] pass. May God add blessing to the
[38:49] reading of his word. Let's just uh pray
[38:52] one more time. Amen.
[38:56] Almighty God, we stand here tonight,
[38:59] Lord, as uh trophies of your grace.
[39:01] Lord, we thank you for your goodness
[39:04] upon our lives. Lord Father, we come
[39:06] into your house tonight to give you
[39:08] praise, to give you honor, to give you
[39:11] glory. Lord Father, we come to hide
[39:13] ourselves in your pavilion tonight, to
[39:15] find refuge in your word tonight, this
[39:18] evening, dear God. Now, as we come to
[39:21] the word portion of the service tonight,
[39:23] we Lord want to bow ourselves at your
[39:26] feet. Lord, we want to, Lord, to just
[39:29] stay focused for a few moments, Lord, to
[39:31] hear what you'd have to say to us
[39:32] tonight. We pray that your Holy Spirit
[39:34] would anoint and inspire, Lord, this
[39:37] little inspiration that you have given
[39:38] me, dear God, to share with your people.
[39:41] Lord, I humble myself before the
[39:43] almighty cross. Lord, may you come and
[39:46] Lord, may you speak, Lord, Father, to
[39:47] your people tonight. We uh long to hear
[39:51] your voice, Lord Jesus. Lord, if you
[39:54] would speak to us, Lord, every water
[39:57] would be calmed, Lord. Father, every
[39:58] storm would cease, Lord, at thy word,
[40:01] Lord. So, we look to your word tonight.
[40:03] We pray that you'd shake us, Lord.
[40:04] Anoint us, inspire us, and raise us up.
[40:07] Help us, Lord, for the times that we are
[40:10] living in for the days are evil.
[40:13] Granted, almighty God, we pray and ask
[40:15] these things now in your precious name,
[40:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And amen. You may have your seats.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Do you love him tonight?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here one more time in
[40:42] the presence of the Lord.
[40:44] And we are grateful to God. I have an
[40:47] inspiration here, a thought tonight
[40:49] rather
[40:51] um based on the scripture we just read
[40:53] of course
[40:55] and it might be a bit of a strange one
[40:57] but I'm praying dear God that you would
[40:58] give us understanding tonight kind of
[41:00] see where we want to take this from
[41:03] but the inspiration I have tonight is
[41:05] remember the Lord
[41:08] remember the Lord
[41:11] and um in this scene what we have what
[41:14] we just spoke about in the scripture
[41:16] Joseph is talking to Pharaoh about the
[41:20] interpretation of a dream that he had
[41:23] that no one was able to interpret.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; No one was able to bring an
[41:29] understanding to what was troubling
[41:31] Pharaoh's uh house.
[41:35] Uh, and Joseph himself is positioned
[41:39] uniquely this way because he has a gift,
[41:42] a gift of being able to interpret
[41:45] dreams. It's something that God gave to
[41:48] him. And just about this time when God
[41:50] is getting ready to announce something
[41:54] that is imminent,
[41:56] that is unavoidable,
[41:58] uh, that must surely come to pass. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; God has a man in place to give the
[42:06] interpretation to what is about to
[42:08] unfold.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; He has a man in position to give an
[42:12] interpretation to point us to the God
[42:15] that is showing us something.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; God always has a people in place to do a
[42:22] certain thing. Anytime God is getting
[42:24] ready to interrupt the flow and the
[42:26] program of things, God always has a word
[42:29] in that for due season and he always has
[42:32] a people, a man, a messenger, someone in
[42:36] place that he could put his hand on
[42:38] &gt;&gt; and use them to speak the word at that
[42:41] time
[42:42] &gt;&gt; to connect the word with its prophecy.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. For that hour. So that is what was
[42:48] unfolding here right in front of their
[42:50] very eyes. And here it was. Uh,
[42:52] Pharaoh's house was disturbed,
[42:54] interrupted.
[42:55] Pharaoh has a dream and it troubles him.
[42:58] And there's no one that can come forward
[43:00] and say what it is. Until all of a
[43:03] sudden, a butler begin to begin to
[43:05] testify of something that he had once
[43:08] experienced. He said, "I know of a young
[43:09] man
[43:11] &gt;&gt; who is in the prison house who who who
[43:13] spoke with me and who told me that I was
[43:16] my job was about to be restored. He I
[43:19] had a dream once and he interpreted it
[43:22] and that dream came to pass. Not only
[43:25] did he interpret it, but the dream was
[43:27] true and the interpretation was correct.
[43:30] And I know the gift is real because I
[43:32] experienced it for myself. The butler
[43:35] wasn't talking about somebody else's
[43:37] testimony. He had his own testimony
[43:41] about how this gift and this young man,
[43:44] Hallelujah, was working in this young
[43:46] man. And that the same thing that God
[43:48] did for the butler, he could do for
[43:50] Pharaoh.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And they caught fate
[43:54] from a testimony from prison.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And all these things
[43:58] are unfolding. I'm just laying a
[43:59] background here.
[44:01] But Joseph has been there a long time.
[44:03] He's been in Egypt for some years. He's
[44:05] been pining in the prison house. Isn't
[44:07] that right? So long that people probably
[44:10] used to seeing him there. Christmas
[44:12] come, Christmas go. They ask Joseph,
[44:14] "Why are you in prison? I've forgotten
[44:16] how long you've been here. Praise God.
[44:19] And he has to go back and give the
[44:20] account that he was wrongfully accused
[44:22] and that he was thrown in prison uh out
[44:25] of working for Piper's house and he's
[44:28] been here for x amount of years and and
[44:30] so forth like that and he's just going
[44:32] on going on and it seems as though he's
[44:35] just been wasting his time.
[44:38] It seems as though there is no hope for
[44:40] of release from prison. Hallelujah.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; It seems as though there's no hope of of
[44:45] of a of a recovery from his situation.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; It seems that all the years that he has
[44:51] spent bound in chains and fetterss in
[44:54] the prison, it seems for not. But with
[44:58] God, nothing is is is just haphazard.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; With God, there are no accidents. And
[45:06] God is about to reward Joseph for his
[45:09] faithfulness for staying the course of
[45:12] the journey for not giving up his
[45:15] birthright. Oh, hallelujah. But staying
[45:17] the road, God is about to reward him
[45:20] &gt;&gt; for his stand for righteousness.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Even in a place that he knows not, in a
[45:26] people that he knows not and among a
[45:29] tongue that he was unfamiliar with,
[45:31] still God was had his hand on Joseph.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And God has his hand on us tonight.
[45:37] Though we might be in a strange place,
[45:39] though you might be going through a
[45:40] trial, though you might be going through
[45:42] a test, though you might be going
[45:44] through a storm, I believe that God has
[45:47] a people in the land tonight. And he has
[45:50] his hand on them. And he is about to
[45:53] reward you tonight. For taking your
[45:56] stand with this word, for taking your
[46:00] stand with this gospel, for taking your
[46:03] stand with this message. God is about to
[46:06] reward a group of people, a bunch of
[46:09] individuals who took their stand with
[46:12] this message.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; He's about to reward your faith tonight.
[46:17] If you only put your trust in Jesus,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; he will continue the word that he had
[46:21] spoken. Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So, and so he's coming
[46:25] out of prison now. He's shaved. He's
[46:27] presented before Pharaoh.
[46:30] And uh he's going he's coming through.
[46:32] And at this point, you know, this is a
[46:34] part where it all makes sense. Now, you
[46:37] know, it didn't make sense when he was
[46:39] sold to Egypt. It didn't make sense. His
[46:41] life did not make sense when he was sold
[46:44] into slavery and when he had to work all
[46:46] the while at Piper's house. He did his
[46:48] best. He put his best foot forward, but
[46:50] the picture doesn't make sense then
[46:52] because God had given him a dream and he
[46:54] said that his that his brothers would
[46:56] bow before him. And he had held that in
[46:59] his heart for a long time. But he went
[47:02] through phases and through phases. He
[47:05] went through trials and through tests.
[47:08] He went through different situations and
[47:09] through different circumstances and none
[47:12] of that made sense at all. Still coming
[47:15] on to the vision that God had had him to
[47:18] be there for in the beginning.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[47:21] &gt;&gt; And he had to come on to something time
[47:23] after time. Isn't that right?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; God had him for a specific purpose. Now,
[47:27] now he's being announced into the room
[47:30] of Pharaoh
[47:32] &gt;&gt; uh to address the king at that time
[47:35] &gt;&gt; because of this dream that is happening.
[47:37] that is troubling the house of Pharaoh,
[47:39] that is troubling the house of Egypt.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; And
[47:46] and so uh and so he's being presented,
[47:48] right?
[47:50] And the dream reveals that a great
[47:52] famine was on its way. That was the
[47:55] whole revelation of it. Uh uh there was
[47:58] two dreams. Isn't that right? And uh
[48:01] Joseph revealed he said that the two
[48:03] dreams are one. Isn't that right? and uh
[48:06] and he began to unfold the understanding
[48:08] of it right there in front of them. The
[48:10] gift begin to work. Amen. Isn't that
[48:12] right? Praise God. Hallelujah. And I
[48:14] genuely believe that God's going to have
[48:15] a bride that's going to be called before
[48:17] great men and nations. And that gift is
[48:19] going to work.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That gift is going to unfold
[48:22] itself. Praise God. Amen. God is going
[48:25] to have you where he's going to have
[48:26] you. Praise God. Amen. You are going to
[48:28] serve your purpose. The bride is going
[48:31] to have a ministry pray to go out there
[48:34] and get that lost sheep. Is that right?
[48:36] And bring them into the fold before the
[48:38] terrible time comes. Amen. God is going
[48:41] to have a people on the land.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger will be the
[48:46] final voice to the final age in the
[48:50] final junction of time.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it reveals that there's a great
[48:55] famine coming. Hallelujah.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to stop this famine.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; It is a time of famine that the mouth of
[49:03] the Lord has already spoken it. The the
[49:06] heart of God has already revealed it. He
[49:09] cannot he himself cannot take it back.
[49:11] Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; What is about to unfold, what is about
[49:14] to come upon not just Egypt but the
[49:17] entire world economy at that time was
[49:20] about to be severely affected
[49:23] &gt;&gt; by this grievous famine that was about
[49:26] to cover the entire world.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible said all the nations were
[49:30] affected by this. Isn't that right?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And uh the only way to survive it was an
[49:37] act of wisdom. Isn't that right? that
[49:40] God would have to show and reveal
[49:42] through the gift he put in Joseph to
[49:45] show how to survive such a famine. And
[49:48] we'll read those verses again one more
[49:49] time. It said, "And behold, there comes
[49:51] seven years of great plenty throughout
[49:54] all the land of Egypt." This was the
[49:57] first fold of it. And then there shall
[49:59] arise after them seven years of famine.
[50:03] And all the plenty, this is the part we
[50:06] want to underline tonight. Now all of
[50:09] the plenty shall be forgotten
[50:12] in the land of Egypt and the famine
[50:15] shall consume the land.
[50:19] And there are few times in scripture
[50:21] afterwards that goes on where the
[50:23] scripture actually says the Bible goes
[50:25] on to say that the famine was
[50:26] exceedingly great and sore upon the
[50:29] land.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; It was in a severe state. Things had
[50:34] gotten really bad. They went from bad to
[50:37] worse. No one can grow anything. They
[50:39] could not sustain themselves.
[50:42] It just got really, really bad.
[50:45] And Joseph in his interpretation here
[50:48] said something very key here is what
[50:49] want to hone in on tonight. That all of
[50:52] the plenty shall be forgotten in the
[50:55] land of Egypt and that the famine shall
[50:58] consume the land.
[51:00] And as I was studying this, I began to
[51:02] realize that in life there are seasons.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; There are moments that would feel like
[51:09] times of plenty.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; There are moments when there feel like
[51:13] there is blessings, that there is
[51:15] harvest, that there is plenteous, that
[51:18] there is anointing, that there is
[51:20] inspiration flowing, that that that
[51:23] anything you put your hand to it
[51:25] prosper. There's times of plenty in our
[51:27] lives where we could easily lift our
[51:29] hands up and praise the Lord. It's easy
[51:32] at that time to worship God because
[51:35] things are going well for you. You
[51:37] praise God on the mountaintop. Everyone
[51:40] loves the mountaintop. It's easy to to
[51:43] to to come in with a smile on your face
[51:45] with some money in your pocket, with a
[51:47] bump in your step. But it is harder when
[51:50] the times of of of famine comes. When
[51:54] things aren't working out, there are
[51:57] moments that feel like a time of famine.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; When things don't work out, when you
[52:03] feel like you're going through a valley,
[52:05] when you feel like you're going through
[52:07] a storm, when maybe there's sickness
[52:10] around, maybe the bills are piling up.
[52:13] Maybe there's trouble on every hand.
[52:15] Maybe you can't seem to find a way out.
[52:18] Sometimes your prayers feel like you're
[52:20] just hitting the roof and it's not going
[52:23] any further than that. Sometimes you
[52:25] feel like you're going through a famine
[52:28] and it feels like there's no way out and
[52:31] it and in in those times that it feels
[52:34] like almost the time of plenty is almost
[52:36] forgotten
[52:38] altogether because the famine can get
[52:41] grievious sometimes. The famine can get
[52:44] sore sometimes. The famine can get
[52:46] flexing sometimes. It not only affects
[52:49] you, but it affects the things around
[52:51] you. You feel like you can't connect the
[52:53] dots. But even in those times, we want
[52:56] to remember the Lord tonight.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; We want to remember that God is still
[53:02] true to his word. That God is still true
[53:05] to his promise. And whatsoever he said
[53:09] is what he will perform. Doesn't matter
[53:12] what famine you are going through.
[53:15] Doesn't matter what pestilence, what
[53:18] darkness, what tyus. Hallelujah. Praise
[53:21] God. Tammalt is going on in your life.
[53:24] That God is still God tonight. That he
[53:28] is still on the throne. Oh, hallelujah.
[53:32] People tend to forget God and turn to
[53:35] their own devices trying to figure their
[53:38] way out of the famine. But we've got to
[53:41] remember the Lord tonight. Oh,
[53:44] hallelujah. Remember God. Remember his
[53:46] promises. Remember his word. Remember
[53:50] what he has spoken to us. That he will
[53:52] not fail us. That he will not forget us.
[53:56] Surely he will not forsake. Uh the works
[53:59] of his own hands. Uh and know that when
[54:02] you pray God answers. When you cry, God
[54:07] hears that cry. Oh, and God will answer.
[54:11] In a time of trouble, you could lift up
[54:14] your hands. Uh in a time of famine, uh
[54:17] in a time when there's no bread, uh
[54:20] there's no water, God give a promise.
[54:23] I'll bless thy bread and thy water. Only
[54:27] obey the voice of the angel. Oh,
[54:30] hallelujah. And hearken to his voice. Uh
[54:33] oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, behold, I've
[54:40] sent mine angel before thee. Uh, to keep
[54:43] thee in the way. Oh, hearken to his
[54:46] voice. Uhhuh. Oh, and obey his
[54:48] commandments. Oh, hallelujah. And he
[54:50] will bless thy bread and thy water. Thy
[54:53] enemy shall flee from thee seven ways.
[54:55] Uh, oh, God shall fight your battles.
[54:59] He'll fight your battles. Hallelujah.
[55:01] When you take a stand for God, he will
[55:04] take a stand for you. Oh, I tell you
[55:07] church, uh, in the famine is the time to
[55:11] take a stand for God. Uh, in the time in
[55:14] the dry times, uh, in the famine, in the
[55:18] desert, oh, that's the time to be
[55:21] certain of God. Uh, oh, it might seem
[55:24] like nothing is happening around you.
[55:26] Uh, but there is still a God tonight.
[55:28] Uh, it might feel like nothing's going
[55:30] on. Uh, feel like nothing will happen.
[55:33] Feel like there's no breakthrough. feel
[55:35] like there's no hope. Uh but God is
[55:38] still God tonight. Uh he's still a
[55:40] healer. He's still a deliverer. He's
[55:43] still a way maker. He's still a
[55:46] restorer. He's still a baptizer. He's
[55:49] still promise uh to pour out the Holy
[55:52] Ghost uh upon you, upon your planted
[55:55] word uh that is in your heart tonight.
[55:58] Uh there is coming forth a glorious
[56:01] wonderful Holy Ghost fire. Oh,
[56:07] he promised it. He promised revival
[56:10] right in the midst of the famine. We are
[56:12] going to prophesy. We are going to
[56:14] testify. Oh, I got feel nothing but the
[56:18] devil cannot move me. Right in the midst
[56:21] of the famine. Right in the midst of the
[56:23] desert, right in the midst of your
[56:25] sickness, right in the midst of your
[56:27] trial, right in the midst of your
[56:29] financial trouble, right in the midst of
[56:31] your family trouble, you stand up
[56:33] tonight and testify that God is still
[56:37] the same. And even if he don't deliver,
[56:40] I will not bow down. Oh, hallelujah.
[56:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:47] Remember the Lord. remember his
[56:50] promises.
[56:52] Oh,
[56:54] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:58] Oh, glory.
[57:00] Ecclesiastes 12 says, "Remember now thy
[57:04] creator. In the days of thy youth, while
[57:08] the evil days come not, nor the years
[57:12] draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have
[57:16] no pleasure in them." Oh, hallelujah.
[57:18] Ecclesiastes is prophesying that a time
[57:22] of turmoil will come, a gloom of day and
[57:25] darkness will come. But remember the
[57:27] Lord in the days of your youth, oh what
[57:31] did David say? Thy word, oh Lord, have I
[57:35] hid in my heart so I shall not sin
[57:38] against thee. When the devil comes, when
[57:42] the trial comes, uh when the deserts
[57:44] come, uh when the storms come, uh you've
[57:47] got to have a word in your heart, uh
[57:50] you've got to remember the Lord. You've
[57:53] got to have an anchor point that you can
[57:55] rock back on and say, "I remember when
[57:59] God was with me in the darkness. He is
[58:02] still here tonight. I remember God when
[58:06] he when I had no more money to pay the
[58:09] bills, he worked it out. I remember when
[58:12] I was sick and he healed me. I remember
[58:16] the Lord. I can rock back on his promise
[58:21] on Ella Abraham bosom. I could rock back
[58:23] tonight. Oh, and I could nurse on his
[58:26] promises. Oh,
[58:29] hallelujah.
[58:31] Nurse upon El Shadai's breast tonight.
[58:35] Oh, remember thy creator
[58:38] &gt;&gt; in the days of thy youth
[58:42] &gt;&gt; while the evil days come not.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we living in an evil time.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the days are evil.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hallelujah.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And I believe Andrew, but Andrew was
[58:58] someone who shared with me that that
[59:00] evil is in every hand. It's not just
[59:02] spiritually speaking,
[59:04] &gt;&gt; but financially,
[59:06] politically
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and in every realm of the world,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; there is evil all around.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; It's harder to do things. It's it's
[59:15] tough. It's Oh, it's it's it it requires
[59:18] a certain level of grit.
[59:21] requires a certain level of grind to
[59:23] make it in this hour. This is a very
[59:26] very uh steep and grievous time.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; No wonder why God chose us tonight. God
[59:33] saw something special in us tonight.
[59:36] Really something special in us tonight.
[59:39] He put it in us before the foundation of
[59:41] the world
[59:43] &gt;&gt; to know that we could remember God. Oh,
[59:46] even in the time of famine
[59:48] &gt;&gt; that is coming or that is here.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Bible said when the sun and the light or
[59:53] the moon or the stars be darkened or the
[59:56] clouds return after their rain, remember
[59:58] the creator
[59:59] &gt;&gt; in the days of thude. Psalm 123 says,
[1:00:02] "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; and all that is within me, bless his
[1:00:08] holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:00:12] and forget not all his benefits. who
[1:00:15] forgiveth all thine iniquities and who
[1:00:18] healeth all thy diseases. Oh hallelujah.
[1:00:22] Is he a healer tonight? He said he
[1:00:25] redeemth thy life from destruction and
[1:00:28] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:00:31] and with tender mercies. Oh remember the
[1:00:34] Lord tonight. He satisfithth thy mouth
[1:00:37] with good things so that thy youth is
[1:00:40] renewed like eagle. Oh
[1:00:45] yes. Yes. Remember the Lord and forget
[1:00:47] not all his benefits. Who health health
[1:00:50] all thy diseases. This verse eight says
[1:00:53] the Lord is merciful and gracious. He is
[1:00:57] slow to anger and plenteous in mercy. He
[1:01:02] will not always chide. Neither will he
[1:01:04] keep his anger forever. For he had not
[1:01:07] dealt with us after our sins, nor
[1:01:11] rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[1:01:14] Uh for as high as a heaven is above the
[1:01:17] earth, so great is his mercy. Toward
[1:01:21] them that fear him. Oh,
[1:01:26] and as far as east is from the west, so
[1:01:30] far he removed our transgressions from
[1:01:34] us. Oh, great is his mercy tonight. Oh,
[1:01:38] let us remember the Lord. Let us
[1:01:40] remember his goodness. Let us remember
[1:01:42] his mercy. Oh, he had a founded upon the
[1:01:46] seas. He established it upon the floods.
[1:01:49] Who shall ascend unto the hill of the
[1:01:50] Lord? Who shall go into his holy place?
[1:01:54] He that had clean hands. Uh he that had
[1:01:56] a pure heart. Uh that's you here
[1:01:58] tonight. Uh oh, you lift your soul up to
[1:02:01] vanity. Oh, but you offered yourself to
[1:02:04] the Lord. You said, "I'll give my life
[1:02:06] to the Lord." And from that time, uh,
[1:02:09] goodness and mercy has been following
[1:02:12] you all the days of your life. Oh, lift
[1:02:16] up your hands and remember the Lord
[1:02:19] tonight.
[1:02:20] Hallelujah.
[1:02:22] Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] Glory to God.
[1:02:27] Oh my.
[1:02:30] Oh my.
[1:02:32] Hallelujah.
[1:02:33] Isn't that right?
[1:02:35] Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:02:39] Hallelujah. Are we here tonight? Amen.
[1:02:43] Oh my.
[1:02:47] Second Peter 1. Amen. Amen. It says, "By
[1:02:50] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[1:02:54] and precious promises, that by these we
[1:02:57] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[1:03:00] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:03:02] the world true lust." Here's our promise
[1:03:05] tonight. And beside this, given all
[1:03:07] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[1:03:11] to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge,
[1:03:13] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[1:03:16] and to patience godliness, and to
[1:03:18] godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[1:03:20] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[1:03:23] things be in you, and abound, they make
[1:03:26] you that you shall neither be barren nor
[1:03:29] unfruitful
[1:03:30] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So if you sow these seeds, oh, so now
[1:03:39] you be neither be barren nor unfruitful.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Now you can see how the famine will hit
[1:03:44] those who don't have these seeds
[1:03:46] planted. What are they going to produce
[1:03:49] because every seed will bring forth
[1:03:50] after its own kind. Praise God.
[1:03:53] Hallelujah. But we so thank God tonight
[1:03:55] that we have received planted word.
[1:03:58] That's why the prophet is saying, "I was
[1:03:59] so zealous about the seed that I planted
[1:04:02] for the body." Oh, because in order to
[1:04:05] get a seven revival, we had to have
[1:04:08] seven seeds sown into us all throughout
[1:04:12] the years. Wednesday night, a Sunday, on
[1:04:15] a Wednesday, flow, here is seed for you.
[1:04:18] Here is seed for your family, seed to
[1:04:21] eating, seed for sewing. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:25] God going to give the increase. Oh, God
[1:04:27] is going to pour out his increase one of
[1:04:30] these glorious days. There's coming
[1:04:32] forth a sound from heaven. Oh, like a
[1:04:34] rushing mighty wind. And just like it
[1:04:36] did in the upper room, it's going to
[1:04:38] pour out upon you. Pour out fire. Pour
[1:04:41] out anointing.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Pour out that watering germatizing
[1:04:46] spirit that activates the seed of God in
[1:04:49] the soul and brings all those virtues to
[1:04:53] life.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; That's what's about to take place.
[1:04:56] Remember the Lord tonight. Amen. In a
[1:04:59] time of the famine, let us remember God.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; So in verse 12, it says, "Wherefore I
[1:05:05] will not be negligent to put you always
[1:05:09] in remembrance of these things, though
[1:05:11] ye know them and be established in the
[1:05:14] present truth." Peter is saying here,
[1:05:16] "Yet I think it meat for as long as I am
[1:05:20] in this tabernacle to stir you up by
[1:05:23] putting you in remembrance of these
[1:05:26] things." In other words, he's saying,
[1:05:27] "I'm not going to be here with you much
[1:05:29] longer. There may come a time when I
[1:05:31] have to be parted from you by way of
[1:05:33] death. I might have to leave you one
[1:05:35] day." Uh, and because that is imminent,
[1:05:38] I I know that will happen one day. My
[1:05:41] mission tonight is to put you in
[1:05:42] remembrance of these things. to let you
[1:05:45] know. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. That
[1:05:48] God is still the same. That these
[1:05:50] virtues are still required. Oh,
[1:05:52] hallelujah. Pray. A holy life is
[1:05:55] required. A holy walk is required. Oh,
[1:05:58] hallelujah. And get up on that third
[1:06:00] pull. Praise God. It'd be you and God.
[1:06:02] Oh, walking together in sweetness and
[1:06:05] humility. Say any little thing to them.
[1:06:08] Praise God. Just as sweet as ever.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's the thunder that'll shake the
[1:06:12] devil in the last days.
[1:06:14] Oh my. That's what we're looking for
[1:06:15] tonight. Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Said, knowing shortly, he said, I must
[1:06:20] put off this my tabernacle. Even as our
[1:06:23] Lord Jesus Christ had showed me. So, you
[1:06:26] see, he knows what's going to happen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; It is not a mystery that he is going to
[1:06:30] leave them.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And so, he has made it his personal
[1:06:33] mission in this scripture to leave with
[1:06:36] them some precious pattern words, uh,
[1:06:40] some exceedingly great and precious
[1:06:42] promises. Oh, and we thank God for these
[1:06:45] promises tonight because it's by these
[1:06:48] promises that we become partakers of his
[1:06:51] divine nature. Oh, that nature of God
[1:06:54] that we are to live out is a sevenfold
[1:06:57] nature. And Peter identified them here.
[1:07:00] And in every age that the the the church
[1:07:03] of that age lived that out. Oh, faith
[1:07:05] was already lived out. Virtue already
[1:07:08] lived out, knowledge already lived out,
[1:07:10] and it conquered in their ages. What is
[1:07:12] God about to do tonight when he takes
[1:07:15] all seven virtues and gathers it up
[1:07:18] together? Oh, hallelu's going to come
[1:07:20] for a sound, brother.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Praise a manifestation of God
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; in these last days.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; So, just as Jesus Christ has shown me,
[1:07:30] he said, "Moreover, I will endeavor that
[1:07:32] he may be able after my deceased to have
[1:07:35] these things always in remembrance." Oh
[1:07:39] my. He said, "For we have not followed
[1:07:41] cunningly devised fables when we made
[1:07:44] known unto you the power and the coming
[1:07:47] of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
[1:07:50] eyewitnesses of his majesty." In other
[1:07:53] words, we were there when we saw the
[1:07:55] sick healed. We were there when we saw
[1:07:57] the dead raised up. We were there when
[1:08:00] we saw the cripples walk. We were there
[1:08:02] when we saw the blind see. And we know
[1:08:04] that if God did it then, he's going to
[1:08:07] do it again in a bride on the earth in
[1:08:11] the last days, he's going to do it among
[1:08:14] you. He's going to raise up men and
[1:08:16] women to live this word tonight. Oh,
[1:08:20] hallelujah.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many amen. My force from God the
[1:08:27] Father gone in glory. when there came
[1:08:29] such a voice to him from the excellent
[1:08:31] glory. This is my beloved son.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; In whom I am well pleased.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; And this voice which came from heaven we
[1:08:39] heard when we were with him in the holy
[1:08:41] mount.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He says we also have more a sure word of
[1:08:44] prophecy where unto you do well that you
[1:08:47] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:08:50] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[1:08:53] the day star arise in your hearts. Amen.
[1:08:56] Amen. And amen. We will stop there for
[1:08:58] now. Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; My do you love him tonight?
[1:09:05] When Jesus was crucified and buried,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was crucified, he the
[1:09:12] disciples were in a state of confusion.
[1:09:14] They had walked with Jesus for about
[1:09:16] three and a half years and he told them
[1:09:17] what would happen. But the Bible said
[1:09:19] they couldn't understand it. They
[1:09:21] couldn't grasp the words that Jesus had
[1:09:23] spoken to them. Praise God. telling them
[1:09:26] that in three days the son uh the the
[1:09:28] the son of man would be offered up into
[1:09:30] sinful hands and on the third day rose
[1:09:32] again. He they they couldn't understand
[1:09:34] that. They couldn't grasp that
[1:09:35] understanding. But here it is in uh
[1:09:38] verse 24 of St. Luke. He said now uh uh
[1:09:41] sorry it's Luke 24 said now upon the
[1:09:43] first day of the week very early in the
[1:09:44] morning they came unto the sephula
[1:09:48] bringing spices which they had prepared
[1:09:51] and certain others with them. And they
[1:09:53] found the stone rolled away from the
[1:09:56] sephula. And they entered in and found
[1:09:59] not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it
[1:10:02] came to pass that they were much
[1:10:03] perplexed thereabout. Behold, two men
[1:10:06] stood by them in shining garments. And
[1:10:09] as they were afraid, they bowed their
[1:10:11] faces to the earth, and said unto them,
[1:10:12] Why seek ye the living among the dead?
[1:10:16] But he is not here. He is risen. And he
[1:10:20] said, "Remember how he spake unto you
[1:10:23] when he was yet in Galilee, saying that
[1:10:26] the Son of Man must be delivered into
[1:10:29] the hands of sinful men and be
[1:10:31] crucified, and the third day rise
[1:10:34] again." And the Bible said, verse 8,
[1:10:36] "And they remembered his words." Oh,
[1:10:40] hallelujah. How wonderful. It's one
[1:10:42] thing for the angel to say it, but it's
[1:10:44] another thing for them to remember his
[1:10:46] words. They connected with the words
[1:10:48] that he had spoken to them while he was
[1:10:51] yet with them,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; while he was yet alive in their
[1:10:54] presence. They remembered his words that
[1:10:56] he said to them. And they returned from
[1:10:58] the safer and told these things unto the
[1:11:00] 11 and to all the rest. And it was Mary
[1:11:03] Magdalene and Joanna and uh and and uh
[1:11:05] and Mary the mother of James and other
[1:11:07] women that were with him which told
[1:11:09] these things unto the apostles and their
[1:11:11] words seemed as the Bible say idle tales
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; as they believed them not. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:19] They still couldn't grasp it. Isn't that
[1:11:20] right?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; But he had to speak it to them. He had
[1:11:23] was telling them all the while. And the
[1:11:25] word is a seed. So when he keeps
[1:11:28] speaking to them, what he keep doing,
[1:11:30] sewing seeds into their hearts, telling
[1:11:33] them what would shortly take place
[1:11:34] hereafter. Amen. And this would happen
[1:11:36] and when that that happened, even though
[1:11:38] they couldn't understand it, that word
[1:11:40] was still sown. That seed was still
[1:11:43] sown. And even in the years when we
[1:11:45] couldn't understand, when we couldn't
[1:11:47] fully grasp the message of Malachi 4,
[1:11:50] those seeds were still sown. Those seeds
[1:11:53] were still sown. Oh, and that seed is
[1:11:55] sown tonight.
[1:11:57] Oh, hallelujah. Malachi 4 already sown
[1:11:59] those seeds. Oh, glory to God. And
[1:12:02] what's waiting on the Holy Spirit to
[1:12:05] take a hold of it tonight. Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my, my time is going
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; and my voice is going also. You pray for
[1:12:11] me.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But the same day at the evening, so this
[1:12:14] is later on down now and Jesus comes
[1:12:17] back to meet with them. And so most of
[1:12:20] the disciples haven't seen them. He
[1:12:21] said, but the same day at the evening
[1:12:22] that the first day of the week when the
[1:12:24] doors were shut. Oh, what a service this
[1:12:27] was. Praise God. The doors were shut.
[1:12:30] Amen. There was no way for anyone to go
[1:12:31] in or come out. They were afraid. They
[1:12:34] were sore. They were going through their
[1:12:36] time of famine. And then all of a
[1:12:38] sudden, the doors were shut. The
[1:12:39] disciples were assembled together for
[1:12:41] fear of the Jews. And then came Jesus
[1:12:45] and stood in the midst of them. Oh,
[1:12:47] there is no shut door tonight that can
[1:12:50] keep Jesus out. Oh, hallelujah. Praise
[1:12:53] God. He is going to come right in. Oh,
[1:12:56] come right into your situation. He's
[1:12:58] going to come right into your heart.
[1:12:59] Come right into your home. Come right
[1:13:02] into your family situation. They try to
[1:13:04] shut the doors, but there's no shut door
[1:13:06] that can keep Jesus from coming in
[1:13:09] tonight. Oh, he's traveling at the speed
[1:13:12] of light. Oh, you just call on him
[1:13:14] tonight
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; and he will answer you
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and he will come into you tonight.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the doors are shut. But he's
[1:13:23] still coming. He said unto them, "Peace
[1:13:26] be unto you." And when he had so said,
[1:13:28] he showed them his hands on his side. He
[1:13:30] said, "And the disciples were glad when
[1:13:32] they saw the Lord."
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus said unto them, "Peace be
[1:13:35] unto you. As my father sent me, even so
[1:13:38] send are you."
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And when he had said this, he breathed
[1:13:41] on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost. Whosoever sins you remit are
[1:13:47] remitted unto them.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And whosoever sins are retained are
[1:13:51] retained. Blessed be the name of the
[1:13:53] Lord.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it tonight? Amen.
[1:13:56] My praise God. Okay, let me do this
[1:14:00] here.
[1:14:02] So now I want to talk about the slavery
[1:14:04] in Egypt because the children of Israel
[1:14:07] wasn't always in bondage
[1:14:09] after God had used Joseph to bring them
[1:14:12] into Egypt to save them from this
[1:14:14] famine, to save them from the great uh
[1:14:17] scourge that was coming upon the land.
[1:14:20] God had provided a way for his people to
[1:14:22] come into safety, to come into refuge,
[1:14:26] to escape the famine.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; God always does that.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; God found a way for us to escape. Oh,
[1:14:33] hallel the hand of the enemy in our
[1:14:35] lives. When the hand of the enemy would
[1:14:37] have cut us off, God found provided a
[1:14:39] shelter for us, a way of escape for us.
[1:14:43] We are only here tonight because of the
[1:14:45] grace of God. We are only here tonight
[1:14:48] because of the mercy of God's covering.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That kept us from
[1:14:53] destruction.
[1:14:55] He made a way. He always makes a way of
[1:14:58] escape for his people out of every
[1:15:00] situation.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He always makes a way. Isn't that right?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And so God made a way for his people. So
[1:15:07] they came down in Egypt and they dwelt
[1:15:09] there for a time.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And that time was a glorious time. I
[1:15:14] mean there was there was barta, there
[1:15:16] was exchange, uh there was trade, there
[1:15:18] was commerce. The Bible said the people
[1:15:20] of God multiplied greatly upon the face
[1:15:24] of of Egypt and the nation at that time.
[1:15:26] God's hand was upon his people. He was
[1:15:29] blessing them. The blessing their
[1:15:31] treasures floors, blessing the their
[1:15:33] vats were overflowing in oil and wine
[1:15:35] and and they had food to eat and they
[1:15:37] had business and they had jobs for all
[1:15:39] the young men. And praise God, everybody
[1:15:41] was employed and everybody was doing
[1:15:43] well.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody was en enjoying themselves.
[1:15:47] Isn't that right?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; But then all of a sudden, the Bible
[1:15:49] talks about a change in season,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; a change in government. That's right. A
[1:15:54] change in administration.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; When that season changed, the Bible said
[1:15:58] there arose a Pharaoh in the land who
[1:16:01] knew not Joseph. Oh, this was a pharaoh
[1:16:05] who did not connect with that old story
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; of how Egypt actually became the
[1:16:11] economic superpower that they were then.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I hope you're following me.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; There was a pharaoh that come that did
[1:16:20] not connected with those old stories. He
[1:16:22] didn't connect with how those Hebrews
[1:16:25] even came into there in the first place.
[1:16:27] It was a different man with a different
[1:16:29] mindset, a different motive, a different
[1:16:32] behavior, almost a tyrant as it was.
[1:16:35] Isn't that right?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Is how he is described in the
[1:16:38] scriptures. He didn't know about the
[1:16:40] dream.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there when it happened. He
[1:16:43] wasn't there when Joseph had to come out
[1:16:45] of prison and interpret the dream. He
[1:16:47] wasn't there when Pharaoh was helpless
[1:16:49] and defenseless. He wasn't there when
[1:16:51] Joseph came up with the strategy to save
[1:16:54] in the seven years of plenty. So that in
[1:16:56] the seven years of famine, they'd be
[1:16:58] able to survive that that that almost
[1:17:00] genocide, that almost wiping out of the
[1:17:02] nation, he wasn't there for that.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there for all of that history.
[1:17:06] And so because he couldn't connect with
[1:17:08] that understanding, uh it would come
[1:17:10] across as though he were ungrateful. Uh
[1:17:13] they decided to bite the hand that
[1:17:15] feeds. And instead of honoring the the
[1:17:18] Hebrews that were among them, honoring
[1:17:20] these immigrants that were among them
[1:17:22] that had led to their own blessing and
[1:17:24] not to their own demise, they sought to
[1:17:26] to to do them harm, to do them hurt
[1:17:29] rather than to honor them. Oh, and the
[1:17:31] administration is because of what took
[1:17:34] place right there. Isn't that right? A
[1:17:35] change in season, a change in
[1:17:37] leadership, praise God, caused all of
[1:17:40] this upset to take place. Phy began to
[1:17:43] despise the immigrants. Isn't that
[1:17:44] right? subduing them, bringing them
[1:17:46] under control, bringing them under
[1:17:47] subjection. Isn't that right? The Bible
[1:17:49] said, "And Joseph died, and all his
[1:17:50] brethren all that generation, and the
[1:17:52] children of Israel were fruitful, they
[1:17:54] increased abundantly. But there rose up
[1:17:56] a new king over Egypt, which knew not
[1:17:58] Joseph." And he said unto his people,
[1:18:01] "Behold, the people of the children of
[1:18:03] Israel are more mightier than we." Oh,
[1:18:06] you begin to get insecure. fear begin to
[1:18:09] step in because they see a mighty people
[1:18:11] among them and they feel as though
[1:18:13] somehow they're going to be overcome.
[1:18:15] They're going to be overwhelmed by this
[1:18:17] people and so they decide to devise an
[1:18:19] evil plot to subdue and to crush God's
[1:18:23] people. Oh, but God knew all about this
[1:18:26] before the world began. God already
[1:18:28] spoke to Abraham and told him that my
[1:18:30] people will sojourn in a strange land,
[1:18:32] Brother Popwell, but with a mighty hand,
[1:18:35] I'm going to deliver them. I'm going to
[1:18:37] restore them. I'm going to bring them
[1:18:39] out of bondage
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; because they're going to end up in
[1:18:43] bondage. They're not seeing that now.
[1:18:46] They're seeing times of plenty. But
[1:18:48] there's a time of trouble coming. But
[1:18:50] God already put deliverance there.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. As an insurance. Oh,
[1:18:56] glory to God. To that they could claim.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; It's laying there,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; but they don't have to claim it.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Let's skip over now to uh to uh Exodus.
[1:19:05] Praise God. And it says, "And in the it
[1:19:07] came to pass that in the process of time
[1:19:10] that the king of Egypt had died, and the
[1:19:12] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[1:19:16] the bondage, and they cried, and their
[1:19:19] cry came up to God by reason of the
[1:19:22] bondage." And God heard their groaning.
[1:19:26] And God remembered his covenant with
[1:19:28] Abraham and with Isaac, and with Jacob
[1:19:32] their fathers. And God looked upon the
[1:19:35] children of Israel and God had respect
[1:19:38] unto them. Oh, when you begin to claim
[1:19:43] uh what is rightfully yours uh when you
[1:19:46] begin to make claims uh to the promises
[1:19:48] that God has spoken uh to the things
[1:19:51] that he has said uh when you go back to
[1:19:54] the typos, go back to the absolutes and
[1:19:57] remember the Lord, remember what he had
[1:20:00] done. Oh, when you begin to call upon
[1:20:04] those promises, the brother B said, when
[1:20:06] the church begin to put all the petty
[1:20:08] things, put away all the squables, put
[1:20:11] all the isms and schisms and go to
[1:20:13] calling upon God, then there'll be a
[1:20:16] national showdown. When you begin to
[1:20:18] connect with your promise for your day
[1:20:21] and your hour, oh yes, yes, yes, yeah.
[1:20:24] We got to connect, friends. We got to
[1:20:26] remember the Lord. We got to remember
[1:20:28] his promises. We got to remember his
[1:20:30] word. We got to remember the covenant
[1:20:32] that he made. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:20:34] Hallelujah. Remember dynamics. Remember
[1:20:36] the quickening power. Remember revival
[1:20:39] is coming. Remember there's an
[1:20:40] outpouring. Remember the sick are going
[1:20:42] to be healed. Remember that missing
[1:20:44] limbs are going to be restored. Remember
[1:20:46] that God promised to deliver our
[1:20:48] children. He promised to break the hand
[1:20:50] of the enemy upon our children upon our
[1:20:53] wives and upon our husbands. He promised
[1:20:56] to bring back the backsliders. He
[1:20:58] promised to boil the trash out the
[1:21:00] church. He promised to revive us again.
[1:21:03] Oh, we need a revival. Remember the
[1:21:06] Lord. Remember his promises tonight. Oh,
[1:21:10] and claim it tonight.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Go back and dig up those old scrolls.
[1:21:15] Dig up those old writings where God said
[1:21:18] it would happen. Pray. Find where it is
[1:21:21] written and begin to call upon God. Cuz
[1:21:25] after a while, you're going to find
[1:21:26] where it is written.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God had respect unto them.
[1:21:34] Wow.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Respect to the fact that they were able
[1:21:37] to find that contract where God signed
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; and said that he would do a certain
[1:21:42] certain thing. He respected that. Amen.
[1:21:46] Amen. Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Their cry was appropriate towards that.
[1:21:51] God respected that. Isn't that right?
[1:21:53] How much more will God respect tonight
[1:21:55] if we go to calling upon God? We go to
[1:21:58] reminding God about those promises that
[1:22:01] he made because God is obligated to meet
[1:22:04] you on the basis of those promises. And
[1:22:09] outside of those promises, he cannot
[1:22:11] meet you. But if he made a contract with
[1:22:13] you, then he has to keep up his end of
[1:22:16] the bargain. Oh, you do your part and he
[1:22:20] will do his part. Oh, and if my people
[1:22:23] will humble themselves uh and pray and
[1:22:26] turn aside from their wicked ways, uh if
[1:22:29] they will go to calling on God, he
[1:22:32] promised uh that he would answer your
[1:22:34] prayer. He would answer your cry, that
[1:22:36] he would heal your land. He promised
[1:22:39] that you are going to hear from heaven.
[1:22:41] We need to hear from heaven tonight. Let
[1:22:44] us do what we must do so that we could
[1:22:46] hear from heaven tonight. Once more,
[1:22:49] this people must hear from God. Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And there must be a people on the land
[1:22:54] prepared to hear that call,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; prepared to see that call go out. Oh,
[1:23:00] think it not strange, friends. Praise
[1:23:02] God. That God called us out all this
[1:23:04] way. My God, this Joseph revelation sent
[1:23:08] us ahead.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; To preserve life.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Praise. Send us ahead. Oh, with a
[1:23:14] revelation. No sign of anything. Just
[1:23:17] going through a famine. You can't show
[1:23:19] anybody anything. You can't tell him any
[1:23:21] evidence of the sick being healed, of
[1:23:23] the dead being raised. All you've got is
[1:23:25] a promise from God. He said that he
[1:23:28] would do it. He said that he would
[1:23:30] promise. He said that seven thunders
[1:23:34] would wake the bride up again. He said
[1:23:37] he would send it. He promised it. And
[1:23:39] I'm standing on those promises tonight.
[1:23:42] I believe every word that is written in
[1:23:44] this book. Oh, and I believe that the
[1:23:47] time is at hand. My faith declares it to
[1:23:49] be so.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, that those seven thunders will
[1:23:53] become a manifestation.
[1:23:56] Oh, hallelujah. That's what we're
[1:23:59] waiting on. A seven thunder revival. Oh,
[1:24:03] to sweep you off your feet and enter
[1:24:05] glory. Oh, hallelujah. To sweep this
[1:24:09] wonderful bride off her feet and off
[1:24:11] into the wedding supper. Oh, how he
[1:24:14] loves his true church. Amen. Amen. Do
[1:24:17] you believe it tonight?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got my voice back. Somebody's
[1:24:24] praying. Amen. Wow. Praise God.
[1:24:26] Wonderful. Let's Let's take this home
[1:24:27] now. Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; So, the prodigal son, Jesus, in the
[1:24:31] parable of the prodigal son, he took his
[1:24:32] father's inheritance. We know this,
[1:24:34] right? And he went away to a far
[1:24:36] country. Set himself up very far away.
[1:24:40] And like somebody said, a far country is
[1:24:42] anywhere from the church.
[1:24:44] Anywhere we have anywhere. Don't have no
[1:24:46] believers. There's nobody he know that
[1:24:47] he could meet on in in Jadus or on the
[1:24:49] street or anywhere. Praise God. He want
[1:24:51] to just be able to praise God. Amen.
[1:24:53] Just go far away with his behavior.
[1:24:56] Isn't that right? So he went to a far
[1:24:58] country, set himself up with his
[1:24:59] inheritance. Praise God. But as the
[1:25:01] Bible said, see, and as Jesus said in
[1:25:03] the uh in the uh in the parable he gave,
[1:25:06] he spent all of it. Isn't that right? He
[1:25:08] spent all didn't even leave back. I sent
[1:25:12] nothing. Praise God. Just spent it all.
[1:25:14] Isn't that right?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then the Bible also talks about
[1:25:16] a famine that came thereafter.
[1:25:20] So you see the lack of wisdom. Now he
[1:25:23] didn't put any systems or any usury or
[1:25:26] investments in place. He didn't see that
[1:25:28] there was a famine that was going to
[1:25:30] come to destroy all of his all of his
[1:25:34] assets, all of his all of his all of his
[1:25:36] material possessions. He didn't see the
[1:25:38] famine coming. He didn't see the famine
[1:25:40] coming. And he would have to put his
[1:25:42] shoes on Facebook and sell it. Praise
[1:25:43] God. because he need money to buy a
[1:25:45] phone card. He didn't see that things
[1:25:47] were going to get so tough that he
[1:25:48] couldn't find a job until the only thing
[1:25:50] he could find was somewhere in a farm
[1:25:53] somewhere mining pigs. Isn't that right?
[1:25:55] Oh my, praise God. And uh he came to
[1:25:57] poverty.
[1:25:59] And when he was eating with these pigs,
[1:26:00] Jesus said, the Bible said he said he
[1:26:02] came to himself. Oh, what a gracious
[1:26:06] understanding tonight. What what
[1:26:08] glorious words tonight that he came to
[1:26:10] himself and he began to remember. He
[1:26:14] began to remember that he was once in
[1:26:16] his father's house. Isn't that right?
[1:26:18] Praise God. Isn't that right? He said he
[1:26:19] remember the Bible said and he said the
[1:26:22] prodical son says he said how many hired
[1:26:24] servants of my father's have bread
[1:26:26] enough to spare and I perish with
[1:26:29] hunger. Oh not even a son but a servant
[1:26:33] has more than enough bread to spare. Oh
[1:26:36] hallelujah. And I am eating pigs here
[1:26:37] with the pigs. Isn't that right? Pig
[1:26:39] food. Praise God. But he said, "I will
[1:26:40] arise and I will go to my father." Oh,
[1:26:43] he remembered something. He remembered
[1:26:46] he had a father. He remembered he had a
[1:26:48] house. He remembered he had a home. He
[1:26:51] remembered he had left his room. He
[1:26:53] remembered the smell of it. He
[1:26:55] remembered what it was like to be a son
[1:26:57] of God. He remembered what it was like
[1:26:59] to put on his clothes on a Sunday
[1:27:00] morning. He remembered what it was like
[1:27:02] to get in his car and drive to church.
[1:27:05] He remembered something. Uh he
[1:27:07] remembered when God touched his heart.
[1:27:08] Uh he remembered when he once was saved.
[1:27:11] Uh he remembered that sweet feeling he
[1:27:13] felt uh when he was on his knees. Uh he
[1:27:16] remembered when he fall in love with
[1:27:18] Jesus the first time. Uh he wanted to
[1:27:21] feel that feeling again. Uh he couldn't
[1:27:23] feel it on the far country. Uh he had to
[1:27:25] pick up his P2. He had to pick up his
[1:27:28] shoes and he had to walk all the way
[1:27:30] back home because there's where he could
[1:27:32] feel the love of the father. Oh, he had
[1:27:35] gone so far away that he was out of
[1:27:38] touch. But here it was. He come to
[1:27:40] understanding. He remembered something.
[1:27:43] And oh, tonight we need to remember
[1:27:45] something. Oh, some of us have fallen
[1:27:47] away from our first love. Uh we need to
[1:27:50] remember something. Uh we need to
[1:27:52] remember what it was like. Uh what it
[1:27:54] felt like. Uh oh. A passion to know the
[1:27:56] word. What it felt like to have a cry to
[1:27:59] get in the spirit. What it felt like to
[1:28:01] have a fervent desire to please God. Oh,
[1:28:05] remember the Lord.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Remember his promises.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Remember his word tonight. Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; The young man remembered something.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And that remembrance put him into
[1:28:18] action.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And he decided to take one more trip
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; back home. No more to Rome. I'm going
[1:28:26] back home. And his father, as you know,
[1:28:28] was always waiting. From day one, he was
[1:28:30] waiting because he knew that boy
[1:28:32] couldn't last out there long. Praise
[1:28:34] God. Amen. Amen. He He belongs
[1:28:36] somewhere. And you belong somewhere in
[1:28:40] the presence of God. You belong
[1:28:41] somewhere in heavenly places in Christ
[1:28:44] Jesus, in your position in Christ, in
[1:28:46] your place in Christ. And your father
[1:28:49] tonight is waiting with arms wide open.
[1:28:52] He is waiting with baited breath to
[1:28:55] welcome you back home, back to your
[1:28:57] position, back to your post of duty,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; back to the place where you belong. It's
[1:29:03] only the devil's deception. It's the
[1:29:05] devil's lie that would keep you from the
[1:29:07] presence of God. But don't believe that
[1:29:09] lie tonight. Remember the Lord. Don't
[1:29:12] believe your feelings tonight or your
[1:29:14] emotions or what everyone else is
[1:29:15] telling you. Remember the Lord tonight.
[1:29:18] Oh, hallelujah. In a time of famine,
[1:29:21] remember the Lord. Prophet said in a
[1:29:24] message called thy house he sent. And I
[1:29:26] want to say I want I want to say this
[1:29:27] that I believe too. The Bible said in
[1:29:30] the last days there'll come a famine in
[1:29:31] the land. And that famine won't be for
[1:29:33] bread and water but for the hearing of
[1:29:35] the true word of God. Oh, we're getting
[1:29:38] ready to close now. Amen. He said, "And
[1:29:40] the people would run from the east and
[1:29:42] from the west and the north and the
[1:29:43] south seeking to hear the word of God."
[1:29:46] And we're just about living in that day
[1:29:48] now. Oh, isn't that right? That's a
[1:29:51] famine. Isn't that right? Not for books
[1:29:53] and tapes. I have lots of that. But the
[1:29:54] hearing of the true word of God, that's
[1:29:57] the time we're living in now. Praise
[1:29:58] God. Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And not disregarding
[1:30:01] anybody else. You see, he said, not
[1:30:03] regarding not disregarding our churches.
[1:30:05] No, sir. He said, "But if you know, I
[1:30:08] believe that in the pulpits of many of
[1:30:10] these churches," he said, "we have fine
[1:30:12] men, good men, real men of God, but they
[1:30:17] are afraid if they say anything that's
[1:30:19] contrary to what that organization says,
[1:30:23] and then they'll be kicked out." Oh,
[1:30:25] there's a lack of boldness, praise God,
[1:30:27] to stand with the son of man and his
[1:30:29] words. Isn't that right? And they're
[1:30:31] left in the cold. Isn't that right? He
[1:30:32] said the prophet said, "I believe that
[1:30:34] what the man needs is some courage and I
[1:30:38] believe that that's why I believe that
[1:30:40] God wants to take somebody could be
[1:30:43] somebody here tonight and make an
[1:30:45] example to show that he will take care
[1:30:47] of them regardless of their
[1:30:49] organization.
[1:30:51] He will take care of you tonight if you
[1:30:54] stay with that word. If you remember the
[1:30:56] Lord and remember his promises." Praise
[1:30:58] God. Amen. Oh, wrapping up here now.
[1:31:01] Praise God. spiritual food in due
[1:31:03] season. He's had pro uh prophecies here
[1:31:06] now and now we're going to type that
[1:31:08] spiritual drought of today. He said now
[1:31:10] you know we're all very aware that's a
[1:31:11] great spiritual drought in the land
[1:31:12] today spiritually speaking. And he said
[1:31:14] you know that was predicted by the
[1:31:15] prophets just before the second coming
[1:31:17] of Christ would be said there will
[1:31:19] become a famine in the land and it won't
[1:31:21] be for bread alone but for the hearing
[1:31:23] of the true word of God and that day is
[1:31:27] now. He said hearing the true word of
[1:31:29] God. Now this types the natural drought
[1:31:31] with the spiritual and prophesied sin
[1:31:33] and unbelief by false teachers and
[1:31:35] modernists in the church had brought the
[1:31:37] place to this coming uh uh oncoming
[1:31:40] judgment. And then when they had turned
[1:31:42] from God's word and his prophet to a
[1:31:45] modern theological terms of the word he
[1:31:48] said but if you notice it's just at that
[1:31:50] time that God always raises up
[1:31:54] something. Oh, and we believe it's just
[1:31:56] at that time now where God's getting
[1:31:58] ready to raise up something. Oh, amen.
[1:32:01] Brother Odor, strike it every time. We
[1:32:03] in a time of lingering, time of waiting,
[1:32:05] time of looking, holding on to his
[1:32:07] promises. You're not seeing any sight,
[1:32:09] no visible signs, no visible evidence of
[1:32:11] fruitfulness, but just holding on to
[1:32:14] what God said. Oh, hallelu. But brother
[1:32:16] Brandham said, it's probably just about
[1:32:18] that time. God always raises up
[1:32:21] something cuz he always does. He always
[1:32:24] does uh nothing until first he reveals
[1:32:27] it to the people. Oh, he reveals
[1:32:30] something. Oh, hal. And then he reveals
[1:32:31] it by his servants. And then Elijah uh
[1:32:34] he said, "But now uh oh, sorry, I missed
[1:32:37] something here." Praise God. He said he
[1:32:39] he reveals it to the people. He also
[1:32:40] reveals it by his servants. Amen. He
[1:32:43] always reveals it. I will do nothing
[1:32:44] until I reveal it to my prophets. Amen.
[1:32:47] Isn't that right? Oh mine. It's
[1:32:49] revealed. Praise God. Isn't that right?
[1:32:51] And so now he said but Elijah during
[1:32:52] this time talking about Elijah had a
[1:32:54] secret place that God ordained for him
[1:32:55] to go musician can get ready to come
[1:32:57] that the thing that we wanted to see now
[1:32:59] just before we have the prayer line said
[1:33:01] you see Elijah had a secret place
[1:33:03] provided by God himself he said and now
[1:33:06] the church never provided it for him the
[1:33:08] king never provided it for him he didn't
[1:33:10] provide himself but God provided a
[1:33:13] secret place for Elijah to be fed all
[1:33:16] the time during the drought. Oh, where
[1:33:19] his flood was pro uh his food, sorry,
[1:33:21] was provided day by day, God provided a
[1:33:25] way of escape. Isn't that right? He did
[1:33:26] it for Elijah. He did it for the
[1:33:28] children of Israel, he'll do it for you
[1:33:29] tonight. Right in the place of the
[1:33:31] drought, he's going to provide a way of
[1:33:33] escape for you. He said he didn't wonder
[1:33:35] what was going to happen tomorrow. He
[1:33:37] didn't wonder if the supply was going to
[1:33:38] run out. God said, "I have commanded the
[1:33:41] ravens that they will feed you." Oh,
[1:33:43] what a wonderful thing. He said, "On a
[1:33:46] wonderful type of a secret place in
[1:33:49] Christ where God will hide you and keep
[1:33:51] you from all harm." Isn't that right?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. It's just the same thing.
[1:33:56] Isn't that right? Okay. Praise God. I'm
[1:33:58] almost finished. Amen. Praise God.
[1:34:01] Hallelujah. And so he said that uh he
[1:34:04] said that uh it's the same thing that
[1:34:06] David did this morning with the ox
[1:34:07] carts. He said they got away from the
[1:34:09] word. When the word was presented and
[1:34:11] gave to them, they didn't want it. And
[1:34:13] therefore, they had gotten away from it.
[1:34:16] And that's what these people had done in
[1:34:17] the days of Elijah. Gotten away from the
[1:34:19] word rather than holding. And remember
[1:34:21] in his words, he got away from it. See,
[1:34:23] and they thought they had the word, but
[1:34:24] they didn't have it. And so, notice in
[1:34:26] during that time that he was going to
[1:34:28] punish the unbeliever, he made a way for
[1:34:30] the believer. It's the same thing he
[1:34:33] does each time. And in the days he was
[1:34:35] going to destroy the world by water, he
[1:34:37] made a way of escape for Noah. in the
[1:34:40] days that he was going to drown uh Egypt
[1:34:41] and so on, he made a way of escape
[1:34:43] across the sea for his people. How God
[1:34:46] makes his way. And where there is no
[1:34:49] way, he is that way. He is that way
[1:34:53] tonight. Where there's no way that's
[1:34:55] going to be made, he becomes that way.
[1:34:57] He is our provider. He is our way maker.
[1:35:00] He is our restorer tonight. Isn't that
[1:35:02] right? Praise God. And prophet said, we
[1:35:04] realize that we are facing some one of
[1:35:06] the greatest hours that history has ever
[1:35:08] known. It isn't exactly the warhead with
[1:35:10] the bright shiny missile. He said, "But
[1:35:11] that we're afraid of." He said, "But
[1:35:13] it's the churches that we should be
[1:35:14] afraid of." It's the hour that we're
[1:35:16] living in that we should watch. Isn't
[1:35:18] that right? And last quote here, second
[1:35:20] coming of Christ, he said, "Brother,
[1:35:21] we're living in the church of God and
[1:35:22] the greatest hours that we're living in.
[1:35:24] It behooves us to check up." You could
[1:35:25] play some softly. It behooves us to
[1:35:27] check up. Go before God, light the
[1:35:30] candle of the word of the gospel, and
[1:35:31] examine ourselves and find out where
[1:35:33] we're falling short. Especially when we
[1:35:35] see all these things coming. We're at
[1:35:38] the end time and the coming of Christ is
[1:35:40] at hand. He said there's no other hope
[1:35:42] for the church. Look, and the church is
[1:35:44] lolly. And he said the church has no
[1:35:46] conscience no more. You can hardly wake
[1:35:48] them up. And the Bible said they would
[1:35:49] come in that condition when they say lo
[1:35:52] or Lord delay his coming. And they'll be
[1:35:54] devouring and fighting one another and
[1:35:56] so forth like that. My praise God time
[1:35:58] of famine. They can't even see. And yet
[1:36:00] they're fighting. Isn't that right? And
[1:36:01] so forth fighting around. It's just
[1:36:02] exactly that hour. Everything is ready
[1:36:06] prophecy and the pages is turned and as
[1:36:09] it was like that and it's ready the
[1:36:11] coming of the Lord. He said the Lutheran
[1:36:13] church lost our light. The Methodist
[1:36:14] church lost our light. The Baptist
[1:36:15] church lost our light. Every light seems
[1:36:17] to be gone. He said the Pentecostal
[1:36:19] everything Methodist acting like this
[1:36:20] and so forth. It's all gone back. One
[1:36:22] great con collaboration of sin. He said
[1:36:23] that's right. We are in the end time.
[1:36:25] The coming of the Lord. He said but
[1:36:27] here's the hope now. He said she had a
[1:36:29] house cleaning time. Oh, and that's what
[1:36:31] we want to have tonight, isn't it? He
[1:36:33] said she had a house cleaning time.
[1:36:35] Talking about that woman with the lost
[1:36:36] coin. She scrubbed old floors. She swept
[1:36:39] the walls. She took down the cobwebs.
[1:36:42] She kept on until she found what she had
[1:36:45] lost. Oh, you got to keep on until you
[1:36:47] find Oh, hallelujah. Find back that coin
[1:36:50] until you find your promise. Find your
[1:36:52] anointing. Find your power for your
[1:36:54] hour. Keep on tonight. And when she did,
[1:36:57] she called her little church sister
[1:36:58] churches to come now. I don't care if
[1:37:00] you're Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal.
[1:37:02] Let us rejoice together. Prophecy said
[1:37:05] when that time come, when the church
[1:37:07] finds its brotherly love, when the
[1:37:09] church finds its holy decency, and when
[1:37:11] the church finds its place in Christ,
[1:37:14] it'll call to the other members of the
[1:37:15] body. Come and rejoice with us. God
[1:37:18] wants the church to love him. I'm
[1:37:20] finished. Remember the Lord tonight.
[1:37:23] Let's all stand. Praise God. As you want
[1:37:25] to give the Lord a praise, offering our
[1:37:27] worship as brother C. Maliver come and
[1:37:29] sing us a worship song. God bless you.
[1:37:33] Oh, may you be filled with his spirit.
[1:37:35] May you be filled with his peace or this
[1:37:36] word of assurance. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:39] Regardless of what you're going through,
[1:37:40] praise God. Remember the Lord tonight.
