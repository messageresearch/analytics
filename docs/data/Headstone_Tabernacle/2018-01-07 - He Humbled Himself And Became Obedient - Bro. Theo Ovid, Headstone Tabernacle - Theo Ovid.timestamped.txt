[59:12] God also had highly exalted him and
[59:14] given him a name which is above every

[1:01:03] Paul speakin an I brethren when I came

[1:01:11] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:01:13] the testimony of God for I determined
[1:01:17] not to know anything among you save
[1:01:21] Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was
[1:01:25] with you in weakness and in fear and in
[1:01:28] much trembling and my speech and my
[1:01:31] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:01:34] man's wisdom but in the demonstration of
[1:01:41] the Spirit and of power that your faith
[1:01:44] had a purpose why why that your faith
[1:01:48] should not stand in the wisdom of
[1:01:51] and button the power of god let's pray
[1:01:53] one more time father we thank you for
[1:01:55] your blessed word and we are blessed to
[1:01:57] read a woman to hear a word interpreted
[1:02:00] through our hearts
[1:02:01] confirm your word with signs wonders and
[1:02:03] miracles and may become a reality as the
[1:02:06] prophet said that the mysteries will
[1:02:09] unfold that we might see the plainness
[1:02:11] of God to know how to conduct ourselves
[1:02:14] in the evil day we live in granted
[1:02:18] father in Jesus name we ask it amen amen
[1:02:20] you may be seated
[1:02:28] without a title this morning this is our
[1:02:31] first service of the year I really
[1:02:34] looking forward for go to the greetings
[1:02:36] among us this year this 2018 we have to
[1:02:40] be looking forward and a great
[1:02:41] expectation and you get what you expect
[1:02:44] and you have to do more if you want to
[1:02:46] get more isn't that right okay so the
[1:02:50] title I have this morning is heat from
[1:02:52] the scriptures in Philippians the title
[1:02:54] is he humbled himself and became
[1:02:57] obedient that's a title just to take a
[1:03:02] scripture text from what Christ did he
[1:03:05] humbled himself and before you could
[1:03:10] come into obedience you have to learn
[1:03:13] how to humble yourself another an
[1:03:18] inspiration the revelation of Jesus
[1:03:21] Christ now we know the scripture Hebrews
[1:03:23] 5:8 says though he was son yet learned
[1:03:26] he obedience by the things that he
[1:03:30] suffered though he was a son it didn't
[1:03:34] get my free pass it didn't give him as
[1:03:36] is you though he were a son they suffer
[1:03:41] and didn't make him a son he was always
[1:03:43] a son but even though he was a son he
[1:03:46] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:03:51] suffered so obedience is something that
[1:03:54] you have to learn yeah yeah you are not
[1:03:57] born with obedience your mother didn't
[1:04:00] give you that I'm your father didn't
[1:04:02] Hanyu that
[1:04:03] you have to learn that and things have
[1:04:06] to come to teach you and to bring you in
[1:04:09] obedience are you with me now you have
[1:04:12] to be able to be taught in order to
[1:04:15] learn it come like if your wife is not a
[1:04:17] good housewife coming to church doesn't
[1:04:18] make a good all wife it come a good
[1:04:21] church member but if you want to be a
[1:04:22] good wife you have to learn what good
[1:04:24] why does anybody come to church that
[1:04:29] don't mean a good husband or good father
[1:04:30] or good mother or a good daughter or
[1:04:32] whatever it is you have to become what

[1:04:42] become that you have to want to do
[1:04:44] better better than you had before

[1:04:47] that you could come in obedience to the
[1:04:50] Word of God that you can follow
[1:04:52] instructions you have come to church to
[1:04:54] judge others you come to church to get

[1:08:32] mysteries come down from God as the Word
[1:08:37] of God and revealed the entire
[1:08:40] revelation of God

[1:18:37] thank God the Prophet said that these
[1:18:40] jokers want to bring revival itself but
[1:18:42] he said 'no man can bring it they take
[1:18:43] the people so the minister have to
[1:18:46] transfer the vision so if you wanna play
[1:18:48] pope and keep everything for himself as
[1:18:50] the revealer of the z miseries
[1:18:53] then he on his own because he has to
[1:18:57] stand there revealing a whole lot of
[1:18:58] things for very long time but the point
[1:19:01] is is still we all come not till the
[1:19:04] minister come the ministry is still we
[1:19:07] all come into the unity of the faith
[1:19:10] into the knowledge not not some come all
[1:19:13] come knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:19:15] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:19:19] stature of Christ measure because we do
[1:19:23] have all the same measure Oh hallelujah

[1:19:30] men we don't have all the same gifts we
[1:19:34] don't have the same measure but the
[1:19:36] content is God

[1:24:44] have everything so nice so early to
[1:24:50] start up the early church start up at
[1:24:52] fire with power and then afterwards what
[1:24:54] happened
[1:24:55] they begin listening Oberon describe it
[1:24:58] they begin cutting off the spirit and
[1:25:00] addint the natural balance once a better
[1:25:07] talked about with doctors caucus alone
[1:25:10] people you know usually title is witch
[1:25:14] doctors then have the doctorate in
[1:25:17] witchcraft not talk wrath which graph
[1:25:22] did different altogether an easier had
[1:25:25] one some witch doctor conference on
[1:25:27] church and he's doing something like
[1:25:28] that
[1:25:29] and he passed a fallen Dolan Anna Faris
[1:25:31] a pastor he became in Jesus name and he
[1:25:33] falling on is mine Pelton spell or not
[1:25:36] I'm sorry pastor rebuke Comanches assume
[1:25:39] you fall back team fell another hall him
[1:25:41] after he came catch yourself I'm - it
[1:25:44] feels like a shout then jump because
[1:25:47] Jesus name versus whatever power that
[1:25:48] fella working with that's rich doctor
[1:25:50] thing this message people without spirit
[1:25:52] they have no clue what this bridge is
[1:25:54] like if say I'm coming up bright shining
[1:25:56] like they came interviewing
[1:26:05] what a mystery they have all glory to
[1:26:08] God that's what we're talking about the
[1:26:11] church have to be attuned to spirit this
[1:26:14] natural part is only pact but in the
[1:26:16] beginning after the church was broken
[1:26:18] the spirit realm there was removing
[1:26:20] spirit bringing natural removing spirit
[1:26:22] bringing natural until the only spirit
[1:26:25] man so-called was the Pope
[1:26:28] it went to one man he's old man I'm
[1:26:34] going to one that actually God say he
[1:26:36] that he hit the lady being conquered he
[1:26:40] hit you not having what you supposed to
[1:26:42] have when you leave that you supposed to
[1:26:44] walk with a bundle of joy a bundle of
[1:26:46] peace a bundle let the simple bundle put
[1:26:50] in man your back a bundle when you open
[1:26:52] that up so you can share it out because
[1:26:54] they never had joy in service you want
[1:26:57] some you have a bundle of it
[1:27:00] a bundle of God's love a bundle of God's
[1:27:02] peace when you go on your job you have a
[1:27:04] bundle of it look at smile hallelujah
[1:27:07] praise God if it laughs there could
[1:27:09] rejoice you could shout because you know
[1:27:11] inside your soul your aunt
[1:27:13] oh god the logos and praises hallelujah
[1:27:17] so what each year the cousin of the
[1:27:20] spirit I did not show off this bridge I
[1:27:22] didn't answer until now there is route
[1:27:23] again we living in the last days they
[1:27:26] closed in the consummation of the church
[1:27:27] now why does Satan hate revelation why
[1:27:32] is he so against revelation it is
[1:27:35] because the entire canon of God's Word
[1:27:39] and church is suddenly built upon
[1:27:41] revelation so normal no one wants
[1:27:43] citizen job visitors keep you in the
[1:27:45] flesh keep your natural you come to
[1:27:47] service you come late so your car you
[1:27:49] sing to get in the spirit that's what
[1:27:51] the signals for the singing is the gain
[1:27:53] inspiration you know the sickness of
[1:27:56] being an atmosphere you know the
[1:27:58] signatures will be singing that one has
[1:28:01] some long mrs. song they write some long
[1:28:02] message song after pictures at a club
[1:28:06] because it's will somebody prophet now
[1:28:08] so it's something good but have no
[1:28:12] anointing with it
[1:28:13] there's no inspiration with it it has no
[1:28:15] fire no process nothing with it is just
[1:28:17] like information in song form
[1:28:21] but when them writers was going to the
[1:28:23] experience it was not information in
[1:28:26] some form when that brother lost his
[1:28:29] wife and somebody say say Lord
[1:28:31] he said precious Lord and he said
[1:28:34] precious wasn't talking on like a thing
[1:28:39] they read in a book and they put some
[1:28:41] words together and call that a message
[1:28:43] song wasn't that it was real the blind
[1:28:51] singer she said I shall know him by the
[1:28:53] prints of the nail in his hands that was
[1:28:56] no message song that was a reality or
[1:28:59] the blood of Jesus Oh Halloween oh it
[1:29:03] was the blood there's a fountain filled
[1:29:06] with blood drawn from Emmanuel's Fame
[1:29:08] where sinners plunged beneath that flood
[1:29:10] lose all their guilty stains or get the
[1:29:15] Lord a shock in the hall
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:21] hallelujah
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:25] in the walls of an insane institution
[1:29:29] the phone the words written the love of
[1:29:32] God so pure so measureless and strong it
[1:29:35] shall forevermore enjoy the same that
[1:29:38] means of song they know liking that's
[1:29:42] inspired stuff the man went crazy trying
[1:29:45] to figure the love of God and have our
[1:29:47] important song written there or give the
[1:29:50] Lord a show we might look crazy some
[1:29:52] time but we are inspired o Cloney that
[1:29:55] God took the Lord a show we might talk
[1:29:58] crazy sometimes we might not crazy
[1:30:01] sometimes but you live your meal
[1:30:03] bi inspired
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:15] so the church is not based upon Jesus
[1:30:17] it's built upon the revelation of Jesus
[1:30:21] Christ what has been revealed so there's
[1:30:24] not intellectual stuff with that
[1:30:26] revelation wherever you have nothing
[1:30:28] doing intellect when when when I say I
[1:30:30] got the revelation of Allah shall
[1:30:31] conceive if it has passed intellectually
[1:30:34] stop Oh
[1:30:38] just rewind could you play that again
[1:30:45] the intellect but because it bypasses
[1:30:47] intellect he says a virgin shall

[1:41:56] we're talking about the same works I do
[1:41:59] shall you do also and greater oh my
[1:42:04] so whatever I'm said when that time
[1:42:06] comes to the Holy Ghost when traveese
[1:42:08] Christ back in the church with power and
[1:42:10] demonstration and healing the sick and
[1:42:12] making a sign that we said we'll follow
[1:42:14] the believers then Satan turns over in
[1:42:17] his bed he does something about that
[1:42:18] until that time cylinder came a church
[1:42:21] adjoint or how much Monsieur reveal that
[1:42:27] is the mysterious balls yes insistence
[1:42:36] see it I'm loading them up when they say
[1:42:38] Satan loading up in mysteries listen is
[1:42:41] a bottomless pit abyss reason and yeah
[1:42:43] but this commander - slamming mysteries
[1:42:45] all day and the itching ears people I
[1:42:48] never see it so sit down laughing just
[1:42:50] sit let's move on to somebody else from
[1:42:52] top already they focus on them not focus
[1:42:56] on the life of Christ to be made
[1:42:57] manifest to focus on that you after a
[1:43:00] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:43:03] do you get that how many understand that
[1:43:06] not a revolution of this church not a
[1:43:09] result of my ministry not mention I'm
[1:43:11] your pastor not that but the revelation
[1:43:14] of Jesus Christ if I die in the morning
[1:43:17] you still have that revelation if this
[1:43:19] just fall flat you say that revelation
[1:43:21] if trainers split into 15 parts you
[1:43:23] still have the revelation of Jesus
[1:43:26] Christ make sure make sure you have a
[1:43:31] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:43:32] I remember good friend of Mines
[1:43:41] the plectrum holiness you couldn't see
[1:43:43] the message I used to work together I
[1:43:45] said share with him the word at a time I
[1:43:49] see we solve it he said you have a
[1:43:52] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:43:54] you say everybody that talked to him
[1:43:56] about his message we talked about a
[1:43:57] brand and say but I Brown saying brother
[1:43:58] Branham Samba he couldn't get that I was
[1:44:00] talking about Jesus but Jesus said how
[1:44:04] jesus said behold I will send new
[1:44:05] prophets and if you see through the eyes
[1:44:07] of Jesus you could present it correctly
[1:44:09] if you don't have that but I Brown see
[1:44:12] who is brother Brown to them but Ron is
[1:44:14] an authority to them but on authority to
[1:44:17] you but you're not present in Christ
[1:44:19] the presentin a prophet like a prophet
[1:44:22] and a prophecy only prophet who is that
[1:44:23] did you even understand that there's a
[1:44:25] promise because in Elisha they didn't
[1:44:27] understand that
[1:44:28] so you presented something that I even
[1:44:30] start to begin to grasp and they turn
[1:44:32] Adamo necessarily rejected they reject
[1:44:34] what you have to be have a religious
[1:44:37] Christ then you could present Christ to
[1:44:39] the people through the Prophet
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:43] so that is why i could tell you i go by
[1:44:46] nobody fight you have your fight with
[1:44:49] this one nice you end up I know you me
[1:44:51] and them don't bring me in the business
[1:44:53] staying a business you fight your fight
[1:44:56] I am i fact the fight I will fight my
[1:44:58] fight I fight my own fights
[1:44:59] I will bring you to church in it that
[1:45:02] brothers and ministers bring the whole
[1:45:03] church and eternally who cheat fighting
[1:45:05] with them fighting fight invite them
[1:45:09] destroy the believers this pass up over
[1:45:14] the past and believe or to sit and hold
[1:45:15] and I already had a fish soup suppose
[1:45:21] they better repent all your undoing that
[1:45:25] edit undo that couldn t Microsoft Word
[1:45:28] the computer you can do that after its
[1:45:31] quality per head and I shot the mind and
[1:45:33] ripped their spirits and saw the wrong
[1:45:36] season them against this one and that
[1:45:37] one who you undoing that God will catch
[1:45:42] them I'm not supposed to do that
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:46] well yeah that strong right that's right
[1:45:49] yeah it's strong but it's the truth and
[1:45:53] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:45:57] shall set you free when they go in court
[1:46:00] they say I do you promise to speak the
[1:46:01] truth the whole truth and nothing but
[1:46:04] the truth that'll take all jury they can
[1:46:08] go online so the first part clear that
[1:46:11] truth break itself at home true you can
[1:46:16] leave out some nothing but the truth
[1:46:18] give us all God say I desire truth from
[1:46:24] the inward parts God one truth from with
[1:46:27] inside the truth from inside of you
[1:46:30] that's why Jesus said the woman go call
[1:46:32] your husband just see what kind of woman
[1:46:34] she is
[1:46:34] it's not a matter she doing this and
[1:46:36] doing that a liver this manner that man
[1:46:37] you know is what inside of her it's not
[1:46:39] what so much you're doing is who you are
[1:46:40] it's such a career he took upon him no
[1:46:43] repetition repetition is what others
[1:46:45] think about you but character is who you
[1:46:49] are everybody can see a nice and nice
[1:46:53] and nice but that dough has to be so
[1:46:55] that's what people say that what people
[1:46:58] think but I you nice do you do nice
[1:47:01] things do you have a nice character or
[1:47:04] are you cooking inside about nice
[1:47:06] outside that's what the word comes to do
[1:47:09] no thought between the bone and the
[1:47:10] marrow and go down in China
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:15] glorious hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:20] the woman dear says that fitted exit
[1:47:22] bread and passes the dogs
[1:47:24] the woman said cute Lord I'm a dog but
[1:47:29] he dog just get crumbs just go your way
[1:47:31] woman she humbled herself hallelujah
[1:47:35] praise God and she receive a blessing
[1:47:37] that's the problem people don't want to
[1:47:39] humble themselves oh yeah they want
[1:47:41] bless they want lessons but I do wonder
[1:47:43] humble because the Obi you have to
[1:47:46] subject yourself and Jesus didn't talk
[1:47:48] they taught it robbery to be equal with
[1:47:50] God he was God but ya come and say I am
[1:47:52] Lord look at me you see these muscles
[1:47:55] these are good muscles be this just like
[1:48:01] a car around a girl she didn't do that
[1:48:05] he humbled himself he became the form of
[1:48:09] a servant and he became obedient and the
[1:48:13] Bible said let this mind be in you
[1:48:17] before that Paul said esteem each other
[1:48:19] better than yourself
[1:48:21] that means see your brother better than
[1:48:23] you bigger than you say I did for
[1:48:27] somebody space I better than she I
[1:48:29] better than he I have more civility in
[1:48:33] another word this one had more
[1:48:35] revelation so he's a man of the aura
[1:48:39] listen every minister going preached by
[1:48:41] the feet and relational God give him I'm
[1:48:44] not trying to have nobody measure I
[1:48:46] never tried in anybody else but what
[1:48:48] what happening I'm very comfortable to
[1:48:50] be what God made me and I want to do the
[1:48:52] best that I can and so each one of you
[1:48:54] must be that way the surrender to the
[1:48:56] Lord isn't that right
[1:48:57] so let's look at the vision we have
[1:48:59] today for the branagh but Ron says find
[1:49:04] out if David left AMA David and the rest
[1:49:08] of them would only a consulted the bread
[1:49:10] of the hour
[1:49:10] you remember David got in trouble right
[1:49:12] you didn't consult the Prophet if you
[1:49:15] want to be remember the AK they were
[1:49:17] feelin move and led to do this and at
[1:49:18] the error and he didn't consult God and
[1:49:20] men died innocent man died so you watch
[1:49:23] if the priests and prophets and
[1:49:25] preachers and theologians schools and
[1:49:26] our nation would have consulted
[1:49:28] our now it won't do them no good didn't
[1:49:30] they don't move out it won't have a bit
[1:49:32] she's gone now she's crossed the line
[1:49:34] five years ago between repentance mercy
[1:49:36] and judgment talk on Motown America
[1:49:39] notice what is then what can be done
[1:49:41] what is to be done let's consult the
[1:49:43] Prophet the Bible where we cannot add or
[1:49:46] take away from it
[1:49:47] God takes us from the Book of Life the
[1:49:49] Bible said Malachi 4 version 10 how the
[1:49:51] seven seas would be open and reveal all
[1:49:54] these mysteries I mean hid through these
[1:49:56] reformers he said how it would be done
[1:49:58] it's in the Bible
[1:50:00] thus saith the Lord God has completely
[1:50:03] perfectly identified that and vindicated
[1:50:07] to be the truth by signs wonders and
[1:50:10] heavens and the sky is everything else
[1:50:11] for it 33 years
[1:50:12] you think they listen to it no they're
[1:50:14] dead it was when this thing happened
[1:50:17] that David saw he said Oh God send us a
[1:50:20] David that can see where you stand in
[1:50:22] that can look out and see God made a
[1:50:24] promise what how he's gonna do it today
[1:50:27] God said it right in his word how he
[1:50:30] would do it God pulled my car my kiyah
[1:50:34] examine his vision before 400 dignified
[1:50:37] prophets he examined his vision as he
[1:50:39] was right he looked back to what the
[1:50:41] prophets said before him to see what
[1:50:43] happened
[1:50:43] he looked back he saw Elijah standing
[1:50:45] there saying up the dogs will lick your
[1:50:46] blood too and he's seen that the vision
[1:50:49] was exactly according to the Word of God
[1:50:51] so he pronounced it no matter what the
[1:50:53] rest of them said stayed with the word
[1:50:55] when my cars and go you see when I come
[1:50:59] back I will be with you he see if you
[1:51:00] come back God never talk to me
[1:51:06] let's look at the vision we have today
[1:51:08] is it building churches is it new things
[1:51:12] is that great things are going to happen
[1:51:14] or is it judgement this is what is feast
[1:51:17] in the world America is perfectly sudden
[1:51:20] right now there is Sodom anointed
[1:51:23] America is getting ripe for judgment
[1:51:25] they have two kings King jong-un on that
[1:51:28] side I'm Kingdom Trump on our side
[1:51:31] both of them chutney whenever I'm
[1:51:33] talking nuclear talk but something on
[1:51:35] the break and you're gonna break soon it
[1:51:37] is judgment there's nothing left but
[1:51:40] judgment you know so the bride have to
[1:51:43] come into position before these things
[1:51:45] begin to strike oh yes they're gonna
[1:51:47] begin to move in because when those
[1:51:48] hands releasing the bag will be here so
[1:51:51] teams will be moving in
[1:51:52] it wouldn't be business as usual or
[1:51:55] business as normal
[1:51:57] something horrible happened watch people
[1:51:59] start a pre Oh God not Ibrahim but
[1:52:02] that's how we supposed to be known
[1:52:04] making a greater push
[1:52:06] isn't that right because Los Angeles is
[1:52:10] a sign for the world not for the bride
[1:52:12] that's for the world outside but for you
[1:52:14] you supposed to see your promises made
[1:52:16] manifest right in your midst
[1:52:20] that was you suppose we're looking for
[1:52:21] your promises isn't that right watch so
[1:52:25] watch
[1:52:25] so David consult the priest of that date
[1:52:28] illusion but it was contrary to the word
[1:52:29] God said he would do it today how you
[1:52:32] restore all things he would restore
[1:52:34] exactly enjoy 228 all the years the
[1:52:36] conquer woman a caterpillar I restore
[1:52:38] everything back to the church exactly
[1:52:42] what they had in the first place what
[1:52:44] are you saying I'm saying tongues have
[1:52:45] to come back prophecies have to come
[1:52:47] back interpretation of tongues have to
[1:52:49] come back give her wisdom give of
[1:52:50] healing every gift has to be back in the
[1:52:52] church I serve as finishing somebody
[1:53:01] represent tongues and somebody interpret
[1:53:03] given warnings exposing people Colin
[1:53:06] Olsson whatever it is that could be back
[1:53:08] in the church then people would just
[1:53:10] walk in the building just any old home
[1:53:11] there was no goddess among those people
[1:53:14] hallelujah fires there and you serve it
[1:53:17] long time you know oh yeah tongues and
[1:53:22] interpretation and whatnot I was on one
[1:53:24] meeting I was so scared I wasn't
[1:53:26] preaching that that was abnormally
[1:53:28] believer winter silver song so and what
[1:53:31] has minister say on the platform and my
[1:53:33] man was preaching talking afterwards
[1:53:34] tongues come and interpretation come and
[1:53:37] when course had to expose some things I
[1:53:38] said the minister said only platform
[1:53:40] sitting down their faults Delta Novello
[1:53:43] and I mean she can literally don't even
[1:53:45] say go call them Falls only platform
[1:53:49] this is say I make that a better spirit
[1:53:53] picking up what's in their people's
[1:53:55] lives and hearts the full operation in
[1:53:59] the church God can film in the world
[1:54:01] which signs wonders miracles gifts do
[1:54:04] you want to see that or just one of your
[1:54:06] words words words words words that's is
[1:54:09] what you must want to see the Living God

[1:54:23] mind-boggling call his brother some
[1:54:25] Pentecostal church and open Bible Church
[1:54:27] and whatnot had gifts and signs along I
[1:54:29] think every sign of anyone else you know

[1:54:35] just try it up our brothers to come to

[1:54:54] bring character because character is
[1:54:57] what gonna positionally place you for
[1:54:59] Genuine power what the Pentecostal I was
[1:55:03] a temporary power temporary blessing God
[1:55:06] couldn't use them because didn't have
[1:55:08] the word to use the word in them
[1:55:12] he used men but the word come to the
[1:55:14] prophet and because they reject the
[1:55:16] prophet the reject the word so go just
[1:55:18] use men flesh and blood but he's
[1:55:21] promised a bride that will be a true
[1:55:23] seed of the word a true right of the
[1:55:26] word and in that prayer will have the
[1:55:28] word and you're gonna use the word in
[1:55:30] the pride that is right the bride cannon

[1:57:29] you cannot fix natural condition with
[1:57:32] spiritual things you can't fix pretty
[1:57:35] natural things and why the Bible says

[1:57:57] what the needs are so for spiritual
[1:57:59] condition you need special medicine
[1:58:01] spiritual attention and you have
[1:58:04] conditions here natural things can help
[1:58:06] you a new car new home signs that will

[1:58:40] was what was in him you know it was his
[1:58:42] confidence
[1:58:43] it was his revelation of God it was his
[1:58:46] revelation of the experience on the
[1:58:49] backside of the desert
[1:58:50] [Applause]
[1:58:57] you can't go very far without an
[1:58:59] experienced ass got to give you an
[1:59:02] experience the experience of what kept
[1:59:05] me all these years
[1:59:06] you cannot go very far without an
[1:59:08] experience with God need to confront
[1:59:12] that pillar of fire you need to get into
[1:59:16] the presence of the pillar of fire when
[1:59:18] you know core is a reality nobody could
[1:59:21] talk out of it it's a reality to you you
[1:59:24] can experience your husband to your
[1:59:25] children to your wife to your neighbor
[1:59:26] to the boss but God knows it's a reality

[1:59:33] and safe Pharaoh let my people go
[1:59:36] that's why Moses go back with no mind
[1:59:38] back as he kill a man 20 years ago or 40
[1:59:40] years ago it doesn't matter he has none

[2:14:09] spirit of his moat here we don't want to
[2:14:12] go astray folks they very unwisely see
[2:14:14] that God can spew out of his mulch and
[2:14:17] that proves that no such a thing as any
[2:14:19] true love the doctrine of in our
[2:14:20] sins
[2:14:20] I wanna corrugating can right now this
[2:14:23] face is not given to an individual and
[2:14:26] it's given to the church he's talking to
[2:14:28] the church furthermore if you want to
[2:14:30] keep the word in mind you recall nowhere
[2:14:33] does it say that we had a motive blood
[2:14:34] we engrave on his palms with a carried
[2:14:37] in his bosom way back in the unknown
[2:14:39] ages before time knew in his mind
[2:14:41] we own a sheep fall in his pastures but
[2:14:43] never in a smoke but what is in the
[2:14:45] Mount of the Lord the word in his mouth
[2:14:48] Oh hallelujah for prophecy came not in
[2:14:52] old time by the will of man but holy men
[2:14:54] of God spake as they were moved by the
[2:14:56] Holy Ghost so what is wrong with these
[2:14:57] people in the last day they have gotten
[2:14:59] away from the word they are no longer
[2:15:01] fervent about yet they are lukewarm
[2:15:04] about it the Baptist's have decrees and
[2:15:07] dogmas based on the word and they can't
[2:15:09] shake them they see their possibilities
[2:15:10] and miracles are over there's no
[2:15:12] batteries or Holy Ghost subsequent to
[2:15:13] believe in and the Methodists have this
[2:15:15] stuff all them clean the doctrine to be
[2:15:16] would be so I'm gonna strain to find
[2:15:19] anything anything the fit date of June
[2:15:20] they put the doctrine first and then
[2:15:22] trying to fit it they will sell out the
[2:15:27] word for sensation about every time if
[2:15:30] they can produce a manifestation like
[2:15:32] oil
[2:15:32] blood tongues and other signs where is
[2:15:34] water or not whether properly into
[2:15:36] from the word the majority will fall for
[2:15:38] it the word God says here we go I am
[2:15:41] going against you all I will see you out
[2:15:44] of my mouth this is the end for seven or
[2:15:47] seven ages I have seen nothing but men
[2:15:49] esteem in their own word above mine so
[2:15:53] at the end of this age I'm spooning out
[2:15:55] of my mouth it is all over I'm going to
[2:15:57] speak alright I'm here in the midst of
[2:15:59] the church the 'man of God the faithful
[2:16:01] and it will be by my prophet then he
[2:16:03] could Russian ten seven and this is the
[2:16:05] voice seven injured yeah it is he is
[2:16:08] still in a vindicated prophet he said on
[2:16:10] a prophet almost two thousand years he
[2:16:12] is sending someone who is so fast an
[2:16:14] organization education religion this
[2:16:17] prophet will turn a half of the turrent
[2:16:19] back to the father's listen to this he
[2:16:21] will bring back the elect of the last
[2:16:24] day and they will hear a vindicated
[2:16:27] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[2:16:30] rapport he will restore the truth as
[2:16:32] they had it and those elected him will
[2:16:36] be the ones who will truly manifest the
[2:16:39] Lord and be his body and be his voice
[2:16:42] and perform his works
[2:16:44] who is that the electret him hallelujah
[2:16:47] a momentary consideration of church
[2:16:49] history will prove in the Dark Ages the
[2:16:51] world was entirely lost to the people
[2:16:53] but court sent loot over the world
[2:16:55] Lutheran's spoke for God at that time at
[2:16:58] that time and watch but they organized
[2:17:01] again the pure was lost for organization
[2:17:05] tends towards dogma and Creed and not
[2:17:07] simple word shout out simple word simple
[2:17:11] word has to be able to be made plain to
[2:17:14] the people not complex because what has
[2:17:17] come in the complexities because LM in
[2:17:19] Ghana
[2:17:19] long time the preachers ad whole mass in
[2:17:21] Latin so the people sitting there and he
[2:17:25] was secular said : meeting me so very
[2:17:28] hands and they go home
[2:17:30] then they converted Latin to English but
[2:17:32] the people sit down and this Catholic I
[2:17:34] did you have a clue him and Christian
[2:17:36] and the mood seducer they have no clue
[2:17:38] whatsoever he is speaking a different
[2:17:40] language revolting he's become
[2:17:43] she's another language God doesn't want
[2:17:46] that one time afterwards yes stop
[2:17:48] talking parabolas he said logo stickers
[2:17:50] no cleanly because he speaking parable
[2:17:53] to tab some of them but he bring in the
[2:17:56] brick of the disciples he is talking a
[2:17:58] certain way but then he begin to bring
[2:18:00] it to them because the mystery has to be
[2:18:03] made clear what you about to receive
[2:18:05] that's why the Bible said he opening
[2:18:07] understanding to the scriptures and open
[2:18:09] the world to them that if you go in the
[2:18:11] upper room without any doubts that this
[2:18:13] promises minds this Holy Ghost is mines
[2:18:16] I'm gonna be filled behold I send the
[2:18:18] promise of my father upon you but Perry
[2:18:21] you see the usual I'm until you be
[2:18:23] endued with power from on high
[2:18:25] there's no power going sideways someone
[2:18:28] high balls on below for money no man
[2:18:32] eternal power from an a dr. Witt
[2:18:36] [Applause]
[2:18:38] and the Bible said when the day of
[2:18:40] Pentecost was fully come I liked those
[2:18:43] words fully come there in one man there
[2:18:47] in one Accord they were prison as normal
[2:18:49] but all of a sudden something happened
[2:18:52] Russian might you win fill all the old
[2:18:54] house fire divide itself give is
[2:18:58] everybody a portion
[2:18:59] [Applause]
[2:19:08] LeBron says the church is no longer the
[2:19:11] more peace of God it is the one more
[2:19:13] piece so what is tilling in her hope the
[2:19:16] church God is doing that oh yes he will
[2:19:20] confirm her to the Prophet and the bride
[2:19:22] for the voice of God will be in her and
[2:19:25] the last day the spirit and the bride
[2:19:28] say come rushing 10 to 17 let's go once
[2:19:32] more the world will hear that from God
[2:19:34] as at Pentecost but of course that would
[2:19:37] bribe you pretty is it as in the first
[2:19:39] age now he has cried after this age you
[2:19:40] have heard you have the word your more
[2:19:43] Bibles than ever
[2:19:44] but you are not doing anything about the
[2:19:46] word except dividing and Hakkinen the
[2:19:48] pieces taking what you want leaving on
[2:19:51] what you want you are not interested in
[2:19:53] living it
[2:19:54] but debate in it I would sooner you be
[2:19:57] hot or cold if you were cold and
[2:19:58] rejected I could stand that if we could
[2:20:00] get white hard to know its truth and
[2:20:01] live it I would praise you for that but
[2:20:03] because you simply take my word and
[2:20:04] honor it
[2:20:05] I will spew you out of my mouth oh my
[2:20:08] let's take a little more the him it
[2:20:11] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[2:20:13] might wrong know what are we to overcome
[2:20:16] that's a normal question that asks but
[2:20:17] that is not the actual thought in this
[2:20:20] verse is not so much what we have to
[2:20:22] overcome but how but no this is logical
[2:20:28] for it doesn't matter what we have to
[2:20:30] overcome as long as you know oh we can
[2:20:32] overcome a quick look at the scripture
[2:20:34] but Jesus overcome devil the temptation
[2:20:37] by the word is written we know that
[2:20:38] watch Adam fell in direct disobedience
[2:20:41] to the word but Jesus overcame by the
[2:20:45] word and right now let me see this is
[2:20:47] the only way to be overcome
[2:20:49] it's the only way you can know if you're
[2:20:52] overcoming because that would can feel
[2:20:54] you have to be able to overcome by the
[2:20:57] word because God said it you're standing
[2:21:01] by it God said it you're staying with it
[2:21:03] is it if you have a dog in your mind
[2:21:06] don't do it and you know you're right
[2:21:07] should I should I should I should I
[2:21:09] don't do it you're right stay with the
[2:21:11] world oh my
[2:21:14] so brother Branham says watch he
[2:21:17] constantly apply the word Jesus he speak
[2:21:19] only what the father gave him to speak
[2:21:20] there was another time when the world
[2:21:22] was not utterly confused by his wisdom
[2:21:24] because was the wisdom of God in his
[2:21:28] personal life contending with himself
[2:21:32] this is big this is huge now this is
[2:21:35] Jesus are you at me in his personal life
[2:21:39] contending with himself he overcame by
[2:21:44] obedience to the Word of God Hebrews 11
[2:21:48] says who in the days of his flesh when
[2:21:51] he offered up prayers and supplication
[2:21:54] with strong crying and tears to him that
[2:21:57] was able to sit on that and was hurt and
[2:22:00] I was here that he feared door he was a
[2:22:02] son yet he learned obedience by the team
[2:22:07] that he suffered I know you're here that
[2:22:09] they're here not intellectually because
[2:22:12] us thought a soft are yet you only get
[2:22:16] his stuff and you you don't fit already
[2:22:19] yeah it's suffer not stuff sometime we
[2:22:24] suffered you leave before I come here by
[2:22:27] my learn obedience so see when we finish
[2:22:31] this service here nobody's complain if
[2:22:36] the roof all along you fix it yeah to
[2:22:38] flat tire
[2:22:39] fix it this happened fix it do some
[2:22:42] about each other will ship Garrick keeps
[2:22:45] women don't give up and wrong you that's
[2:22:49] what I'm saying but you see people feel
[2:22:50] entitled what if Paul said you're
[2:22:52] entitled Lord God don't know I'm a
[2:22:54] prophet to the jetpens
[2:22:56] this that's supposed to happen to me
[2:22:59] what was the people think shrimp or swim
[2:23:02] in sports around when I bought that
[2:23:11] sinking opposed I'm poor Paul would be
[2:23:15] bawling because he'd be drawing inside
[2:23:18] of a pole ship record everybody else had
[2:23:21] to fight up pull things off the shore
[2:23:23] get word light fire and all of a sudden
[2:23:27] a snake bite him now everybody know that
[2:23:29] sneakin that's Nick don't make joke in
[2:23:32] one minute you're gone
[2:23:34] and Paul just shake of the snake and
[2:23:37] continue anybody looking calm ten 10
[2:23:39] nine eight seven six five four three two
[2:23:46] one understanding for say Jesus thinks
[2:23:52] I'll bite them and shall let them be
[2:23:56] snake-proof payments on a week is had a
[2:24:01] man used to bring snakes unless nicked
[2:24:03] by try the vitamin and was protected and
[2:24:05] say you know eventually as they buy them
[2:24:08] but he was trying to prove what courts
[2:24:11] say I'm not doing that
[2:24:12] nice his job if you want to do that
[2:24:14] let's feel free to go and do that but my
[2:24:16] point is this God proved himself Paul
[2:24:19] being shipwreck for we know all things
[2:24:22] work together for good to them that love
[2:24:26] God even when you shipwreck when the
[2:24:29] marriage when you're Homer when this
[2:24:32] happened and that happened even oh boy
[2:24:35] yeah shout in the house
[2:24:39] what was Jesus obedient to the Word of
[2:24:42] God then there will be not be one person
[2:24:45] there will not be one person who will
[2:24:48] sit on the tune of Jesus Christ unless
[2:24:51] he has been living that word your
[2:24:54] prayers your fasting your repentance is
[2:24:58] no matter what you presented God will
[2:25:00] not gain you the privilege of sitting on
[2:25:02] that throne
[2:25:03] it will be granted only to the word
[2:25:05] brand as at Roane is shared with the
[2:25:08] Queen understand this fasting is not all
[2:25:12] be faster as part of what you do but
[2:25:14] that is not what if God tell you
[2:25:15] something and you're fasting faster once
[2:25:17] they pick up that people from there
[2:25:18] you're faster you're faster once they
[2:25:20] pick up the people from there until you
[2:25:21] pick up a paper you're faster less
[2:25:22] reason than ever
[2:25:23] God is on your fast he said pick any
[2:25:26] paper you want a faster cutting it for
[2:25:28] you follow what God saying this word
[2:25:30] husband love your wife thank you would I
[2:25:33] didn't put that in so I would appreciate
[2:25:38] a feeling preacher would appreciate you
[2:25:39] know I didn't put a wife obey a husband
[2:25:43] I didn't write not the Bible cheering
[2:25:46] obey your parents debugger put that in
[2:25:48] oh hallelujah all right let's go on the
[2:25:51] home stretch now now the burden of the
[2:25:54] word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I
[2:25:56] have loved you see the Lord you have to
[2:25:58] say where he loves us watch they could
[2:26:02] not figure out God's love they thought
[2:26:05] that love meant no suffering they
[2:26:09] thought that love meant baby with
[2:26:12] parental care but God said his love was
[2:26:17] elective love the proof of his love is
[2:26:20] election that no matter what happened
[2:26:23] his love was proven truly by the fact
[2:26:25] that they were chosen and salvation
[2:26:27] because God had chosen you to salvation
[2:26:29] should a sunny vacation on Spirit and
[2:26:32] belief of the truth he made me come he
[2:26:34] made me commit you to death as he did
[2:26:36] Paul he may commit you to suffering
[2:26:39] there is no II Men on that one but I
[2:26:41] sell the word so we say Amen anyhow that
[2:26:44] don't mean you're gonna and Dad did the
[2:26:46] same amen to the truth
[2:26:48] I'll see it again just to get a
[2:26:50] confirmation he may commit you to
[2:26:53] suffering as he did jus he may commit to
[2:26:56] the deficit Paul that is his prerogative
[2:26:58] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[2:27:05] purpose if he did not have a purpose
[2:27:09] then he would be the author of
[2:27:11] frustration and not peace so gourds are
[2:27:15] the author over a frustrated a
[2:27:16] frustrated yeah you first reason Gordon

[2:34:37] Brandon do a sunny little bean I think
[2:34:40] he suffered James 1 to the 4 count it
[2:34:42] all joy when you fall into divers
[2:34:44] temptations neither religion myself
[2:34:46] knowing this that the trying of your
[2:34:49] faith work patience let patience have a
[2:34:52] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[2:34:54] entire wanted nothing for I reckon that
[2:34:57] the sufferings of this present time
[2:34:58] there we go
[2:34:59] is that worthy to be compared with the
[2:35:01] glory which shall be revealed in us all
[2:35:04] glory to God
[2:35:06] sister cormaneau is a no pain no
[2:35:09] suffering she has one of mine eyes
[2:35:11] everything is back everything is normal
[2:35:13] she's happy she's rejoicing she's
[2:35:16] shocked him
[2:35:17] she made it over
[2:35:20] but I want to make it over you want them
[2:35:22] make it over Oh glorious listeners
[2:35:28] unless we suffer with him
[2:35:31] we cannot reign with him you have to
[2:35:35] suffer there in that should be a messy
[2:35:38] Vader you know that Tyson some time ago
[2:35:40] how to preach that one the other
[2:35:41] suffered I mean the reason for this is
[2:35:44] reason this reason there isn't character
[2:35:47] simply is never made without suffering
[2:35:51] that's why it's painful to see poor
[2:35:54] parenting and people spoil their
[2:35:56] children to debt our series is a painful
[2:36:00] thing mothers destroy sons destroy the
[2:36:04] one family by their behavior by their
[2:36:08] conduct by the operation I refuse him to
[2:36:11] be the kind of example that the children
[2:36:14] could see and reflect on when they time
[2:36:17] come they ruin their marriages and their
[2:36:19] homes and their lives and all your name
[2:36:23] of you love your child
[2:36:24] yeah a spoiler child if you only look
[2:36:27] how God handle his children and you try
[2:36:29] to emulate how God does that you'll be a
[2:36:31] whole different ball game altogether oh
[2:36:33] yes alright let's go
[2:36:36] character is simply never made without
[2:36:40] suffering character is a victory not a
[2:36:42] gift a man without character cannot
[2:36:46] dream because power upon character is
[2:36:50] satanic so when I see brothers ministers
[2:36:53] lying and deceitful and underhand and
[2:36:55] cover up or whatever it is I know
[2:36:57] they're not option for them it has not
[2:37:00] done for that or in a power yes
[2:37:02] temporary power people power people love
[2:37:05] your power and engine power woodland
[2:37:08] that's right
[2:37:08] microphone power but not power with God
[2:37:14] not not Jesus a man a priest of God not
[2:37:18] that that can come like that there has
[2:37:21] to be the right behavior but Romney's
[2:37:23] return the right kind of a son not son
[2:37:28] why can it have 20 different mangoes you
[2:37:31] know who hear the mango the mangoes the
[2:37:34] kind of mango it's a twenty sons
[2:37:37] kind of son you are the right angle and
[2:37:40] your behavior set your to be the kind
[2:37:43] not your mysteries not revelations
[2:37:46] letter convert that into behavior you
[2:37:51] have to convert all and revelations into
[2:37:53] a behavior which is a life and that is
[2:37:57] what could the the develop or glory
[2:37:59] to God
[2:38:00] a man without character can reign
[2:38:02] because power
[2:38:04] apart from karate a satanic but Paul
[2:38:06] with character fit to rule and since he
[2:38:08] wanted to share even the strewn on the
[2:38:10] same basis that he overcame and said on
[2:38:12] his Father's throne then we have to
[2:38:14] overcome to sit with him and the little
[2:38:17] temporary suffering we go true now is
[2:38:21] not worthy to be compared to the
[2:38:24] tremendous glory that would reveal in us
[2:38:27] when he comes oh what treasures are laid
[2:38:30] up for those who are willing to enter
[2:38:32] his kingdom through much tribulation so
[2:38:37] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[2:38:39] no signs of God disapproval neither the
[2:38:41] bright skies and still waters signs of
[2:38:43] God's love and approval his approval of
[2:38:45] any of us is only in the beloved his
[2:38:48] love is elective which he had for us
[2:38:50] before the foundation of the world
[2:38:52] how does he love us yes how shall we
[2:38:54] know we shall know because he said so
[2:38:57] and manifest that he loved us for he
[2:39:00] brought us to himself and give us his
[2:39:01] spirit placing us as sons
[2:39:04] how shall I prove my love to him are you
[2:39:07] ready ever your life are you ready
[2:39:10] how shall I prove my love to him by
[2:39:13] conducted by believing what he said and
[2:39:15] by conducting myself with joy
[2:39:18] I missed the trials he in his wisdom
[2:39:21] allows come to pass
[2:39:23] that's how you pull back your love to
[2:39:25] God conduct yourself with joy believing
[2:39:29] what he said sure because of in his
[2:39:32] wisdom send those things
[2:39:35] now friends many things the people do
[2:39:39] and see I am NOT the judge of people
[2:39:42] but I think any ministry or any
[2:39:45] demonstration of the Spirit of God that
[2:39:47] can't be backed up in this Bible I would
[2:39:51] leave it alone
[2:39:52] if anything that anyone says that isn't
[2:39:55] backed up by the scripture I couldn't go
[2:39:57] with it although I wouldn't say it
[2:39:59] wasn't God till I seen the fruits of it
[2:40:02] then I would say nothing about it I'll
[2:40:04] just let it go like that so that is just
[2:40:06] a little side ba and this whole thing oh
[2:40:09] I'll skip that skip that the prophets of
[2:40:13] the Old Testament I want anytime they
[2:40:15] live in the presence of God until become
[2:40:16] with the word their message is the wood
[2:40:18] itself now the Holy Spirit will not miss
[2:40:22] me if I'm almost done musical calm
[2:40:23] please the Holy Spirit will not miss the
[2:40:26] a myself in one person and behave itself
[2:40:28] in another it will make here we go
[2:40:30] and we'll make each person come into its
[2:40:35] character because it's the spirit that
[2:40:39] leads you you are not all that natural
[2:40:43] anything you know there's a spirit
[2:40:45] influence in your life whatever Spirit
[2:40:50] is there's something influence in your
[2:40:51] life let's let's trust is the right
[2:40:53] influence but the Holy Spirit would
[2:40:56] bring each person into its character
[2:40:59] because it's a still that leaves you it
[2:41:01] makes you subject to its nature you
[2:41:04] don't bring it subject to your nature it
[2:41:06] makes you subject to its nature the Holy
[2:41:09] Spirit makes you live and love to do it
[2:41:11] oh you love to give up the things of the
[2:41:13] world when the Holy Spirit comes in all
[2:41:16] right every word in the Bible is got
[2:41:19] thoughts latency form and if they
[2:41:21] receive into human being and spoke by
[2:41:23] the same thought that materias the Bible
[2:41:25] it brings it to pass I'll skip that I'll
[2:41:28] skip that all right okay so but Abraham
[2:41:34] okay I'm getting there
[2:41:35] what I'm talking about um each age God
[2:41:39] places two things into this church all
[2:41:41] right
[2:41:42] I'm showing that each individual that
[2:41:44] possess these qualities for money some
[2:41:46] virtues and this being this sub virtues
[2:41:49] being is the Church of God that's going
[2:41:52] to the rapture not this confession of
[2:41:54] mysteries no this being when it's
[2:41:57] completed is the church that's gonna
[2:42:00] rupture okay are you with me hallelujah
[2:42:03] and this being when completed is a
[2:42:08] servant of God in the church of god
[2:42:12] that's going in the rapture so every
[2:42:14] minister have to complete get is being
[2:42:16] completed to go in the rapture
[2:42:19] you see when that big magnet come that
[2:42:22] magnet that rapture magnet I want you to
[2:42:24] look at it now the magnet a pickup cloth
[2:42:26] a magnet can pick up wood so let's wrap
[2:42:30] your magnet could only pick up those
[2:42:32] virtues that magnet not coming up books
[2:42:38] on tapes are all around books or round
[2:42:41] tips you will stay with that creature
[2:42:42] Alicia with the books and his ears
[2:42:45] there's no rewrapped is about he told
[2:42:48] bound tabernacle you have to apply the
[2:42:49] token that's part next fact you have to
[2:42:52] display it applied and displayed
[2:42:54] displayed any we must see it remember
[2:42:57] Moses time take the blood and put it on
[2:42:59] the doorpost on this this this that when
[2:43:03] I see it I will pass over so there is
[2:43:07] something that must be displayed not
[2:43:11] talked I know pastors like to see your
[2:43:17] villain in mystery manifesting here
[2:43:22] alright that sounds kind of good the
[2:43:26] manifestation is son speak because the
[2:43:28] revealing hidden mysteries but bore a
[2:43:30] module on mysteries we can only echo
[2:43:32] what the prophecy ain't a man reveal a
[2:43:34] mystery Berman reveals you know that man
[2:43:36] of God a promise that it's almost one
[2:43:39] messenger to reveal every mystery that's
[2:43:43] why we could take the message than just
[2:43:44] every minister they don't judge him by
[2:43:46] his group your judge my how we stay with
[2:43:47] the word you can't judge me by my
[2:43:49] children you just may hope I stay with
[2:43:51] the word that's the only way you
[2:43:52] authorize to judge me
[2:43:54] all glories are going along I'm on the
[2:43:56] way you can't take me off you can't take
[2:43:59] me out
[2:43:59] all glory that God wants you on the way
[2:44:02] nobody could take you out
[2:44:04] hallelujah praise God in their glory so
[2:44:08] do you see it now all right
[2:44:10] it's sort of maybe next week this is too
[2:44:13] much boy Wow
[2:44:14] Mamma Mia we try to make weakness no
[2:44:18] excuses you want to tell how big we are
[2:44:20] how great we are
[2:44:21] and I think that's what scored give me
[2:44:24] this text for the little things that we
[2:44:26] do and become the church as the fine
[2:44:28] whale of false is that we can better
[2:44:30] ourselves we must come to find our
[2:44:32] weaknesses find our bad places and see
[2:44:35] how little we are and put our trust and
[2:44:38] somebody that strong and the reason he
[2:44:40] chooses us when we say we're
[2:44:42] insufficient when we say I can't do it
[2:44:46] and you're feeling less down you feel
[2:44:47] unworthy you're feeling struggle in he
[2:44:50] knows that and yet he choose you and he
[2:44:53] knows your spirit on your condition and
[2:44:56] he says the reason he chooses us because
[2:44:59] we in that condition that song strange
[2:45:02] if God been willing we find out that
[2:45:05] weaknesses and rejections we find out
[2:45:08] that those people who are the weakest
[2:45:10] and rejected by the outside world is God
[2:45:13] heroes that's the Conqueror and the
[2:45:16] frontline doors that feel himself
[2:45:18] unworthy I met his brother three of them
[2:45:21] they said well Ron we just need the Holy
[2:45:22] Ghost know she received gifts to the
[2:45:24] ministry I said don't do it let it alone
[2:45:27] he said because we need the Holy Ghost
[2:45:29] and we need gifts you say unbecoming
[2:45:31] stuff it is always duel trying to
[2:45:33] get away from it easy no seed nothing
[2:45:35] got anything where you give it to you
[2:45:36] notice it takes the weakest and rejected
[2:45:40] and practically every hero God ever had
[2:45:44] on the front line was that type of
[2:45:46] person a person that was rejected a
[2:45:48] person that thought he was insufficient
[2:45:50] a person that had no ability at all then
[2:45:53] that person is in good shape so God can
[2:45:56] start using them I have no ability Lord
[2:45:59] I can't talk this that
[2:46:03] when we are thinking that we're able to
[2:46:05] do it
[2:46:06] God can't use us because we wanted to do
[2:46:08] ourselves no watch so the other side we
[2:46:12] get these feelings and we think that we
[2:46:14] insufficient we don't want to do it and
[2:46:15] if we listen to the call of God that's
[2:46:18] the very thing that God wants us to do
[2:46:19] when we are in here we go this is a big
[2:46:22] thing when we are insufficient ourselves
[2:46:26] then we are subjects to you to God's
[2:46:30] theory as long as we think we can do it
[2:46:33] we can't do it when we get to a place
[2:46:36] where we know we can't do it then we
[2:46:38] heal ourselves to God and he does it if
[2:46:41] it's us trying to do it will feel but if
[2:46:44] we year ourselves to God then God can't
[2:46:46] fail that's one thing you can't do this
[2:46:48] feel the important thing what an
[2:46:52] important thing we must master remember
[2:46:54] this especially you young preachers only
[2:46:57] members are like there's one thing you
[2:46:59] have got to master if you expect to
[2:47:01] fulfill God's desire in our lives we
[2:47:03] have to master the thought of human
[2:47:04] ability if we get to a spot where we
[2:47:07] think we can do it with our own
[2:47:09] intelligence our own abilities we've got
[2:47:11] a master's in such a way that we can get
[2:47:13] rid of the things as laid aside so God
[2:47:16] can use us and make a complete surrender
[2:47:18] to us no ability when we expect in
[2:47:23] saying this guy is a great person this
[2:47:24] is a great person I'll lean on him that
[2:47:26] this piece is God so when our Minister
[2:47:28] put himself us as deal lampposts up hill
[2:47:30] anyhow lean on me
[2:47:33] God hates that it must be him it must be
[2:47:37] him working through the ministry it
[2:47:39] might be him in the man then you see God
[2:47:41] isn't that right no ability I don't care
[2:47:44] whose it is would ever be usable in the
[2:47:45] sight of God God has to get all our
[2:47:47] abilities out of us before he can
[2:47:49] achieve his purpose he's got something
[2:47:51] for us to do a lot only we do not pretty
[2:47:53] good job he never built use of God we
[2:47:55] have got together on human ability we
[2:47:57] have got to get to a place where we can
[2:47:59] surrender our souls lives even to the
[2:48:00] housewife
[2:48:01] to the farmer to the mechanic whosoever
[2:48:03] we are we gotta surrender completely to
[2:48:05] God knowing we are nothing and then God
[2:48:08] starts from there he starts moving
[2:48:09] working that includes all of us
[2:48:12] oh my what about him said the reason
[2:48:16] that Paul was fearing it's not because
[2:48:18] he was scared of anything but he was
[2:48:20] scared he would displease God in some
[2:48:22] way and he will get his own ability
[2:48:24] mixed up into it
[2:48:25] so he said I didn't come with excellency
[2:48:27] of speech I come to you in fear that and
[2:48:30] so forth I come to know only Christ and
[2:48:32] him crucified the greatest enemy I got
[2:48:35] is William Branham he's the one that's
[2:48:37] gets in God's Way he's the one that gets
[2:48:39] lazy he's the one that gets to a place
[2:48:40] sometimes ie thinks he can do something
[2:48:42] about it and when he does that she was
[2:48:44] going out the picture but when I can get
[2:48:46] rid of that guy then I could get to a
[2:48:48] place he's out of the way then God can
[2:48:50] come over and do things William Branham
[2:48:52] knows nothing about how many ministers
[2:48:55] could God use this morning if the only
[2:48:58] that God bind them with his word with
[2:49:00] his power and loosed them from the
[2:49:01] strength of dedi nomination an
[2:49:03] organization how many sins have people
[2:49:05] in a city this morning that goes to
[2:49:06] these great organization churches how
[2:49:08] many could fill with Holy Ghost said his
[2:49:10] country afar with the gospel and the
[2:49:11] power is the only take and lose
[2:49:14] themselves from the power that they have
[2:49:15] and be bound to the spirit power Paul
[2:49:18] had Moses realized look I'm almost done
[2:49:24] no no keep saying that but almost done
[2:49:27] Moses realized God took him back to the
[2:49:31] wilderness to learn some human
[2:49:32] weaknesses he puts
[2:49:38] your custom being really managed Egypt I
[2:49:42] mean copied rule for him the poor his
[2:49:44] right everyone got it sorry
[2:49:47] he took him back to learn well all about
[2:49:49] so he and where will he learn did he can
[2:49:53] listen grant must have had a time with
[2:49:54] him back there mood had a temper and God
[2:49:57] gave my wife my name is report she had
[2:49:59] one too so I imagine things wasn't so
[2:50:02] pleasing back on the backside a desert
[2:50:03] for a while when both of the temper get
[2:50:05] out of control at the same time I
[2:50:07] suppose his intellectual conception of
[2:50:09] how psychology or to control a person
[2:50:11] didn't do much good because he because
[2:50:14] on his road to Egypt she's still at his
[2:50:16] temper she said you're a bloody husband
[2:50:17] to me God was so angry that he's looking
[2:50:20] at the end and he could have found him a
[2:50:21] harmless lead
[2:50:22] watch
[2:50:24] human weaknesses here we go we'll never
[2:50:26] be used of God this is the point God by
[2:50:30] human weaknesses
[2:50:32] pause himself into you and he uses
[2:50:36] himself you just become an instrument
[2:50:39] because it got yourself out of the way
[2:50:41] did God feel sorry for Moses with all
[2:50:44] his weaknesses say poor little Moses
[2:50:46] something sho has happened to you you
[2:50:48] fell from your degree yeah yeah great
[2:50:51] intellectual brother you had your PhD
[2:50:53] you are weak no God wasn't sorry for him
[2:50:56] God never took pity on him God had him
[2:50:59] cured of all that stuff and he wasn't
[2:51:02] sorry for him oh my forty years out
[2:51:06] there I had you unzip or fasten kind of
[2:51:08] I'm gonna wilderness where they could
[2:51:09] find out their human riches are not and
[2:51:11] then on so forth oh my I think I want to
[2:51:17] read this one could I read something for
[2:51:18] you somebody tell Barbara he's just a
[2:51:21] nice man and nice person I'm so happy
[2:51:23] for that I'm saying program there's one
[2:51:26] thing one thing wrong what's that sister
[2:51:27] system one thing bird man that if you
[2:51:29] could just compromise with a little
[2:51:30] doctrine you have every organism will
[2:51:33] receive you he said I said I'm what
[2:51:36] doctrine sister that baptism in jesus
[2:51:38] name i said but sister you couldn't
[2:51:40] expect me to compromise on the word and
[2:51:43] still be a servant of god she said well
[2:51:46] there's a bunch of ministers I'm here to
[2:51:47] represent out of this big city and I if
[2:51:50] you tell them that the angel of the Lord
[2:51:52] that gives you these visions told you to
[2:51:55] baptized in Jesus name they will be
[2:51:56] willing to accept it he said well I said
[2:52:02] their experiences wicked and dishwater I
[2:52:06] don't care what any angel would see if
[2:52:09] it ain't according to the word I don't
[2:52:12] believe it if that angel told me
[2:52:15] something different from that
[2:52:17] I wonder the angel God word is first
[2:52:21] above all the engines that way you may
[2:52:24] say bring your insulin come because we
[2:52:27] have the word hey man - just what any
[2:52:30] angel is saying and por favor
[2:52:32] angel any other gospel let him be
[2:52:35] accursed
[2:52:35] [Applause]
[2:52:39] when Jacob lost all his strength then
[2:52:42] God give him power to become a prince
[2:52:44] when poor lost his education God made
[2:52:47] him a missionary to the Gentiles
[2:52:48] when Moses knows all of his ability
[2:52:50] become weak God making powerful to sell
[2:52:53] him to Egypt when you are weak then you
[2:52:56] are strong
[2:52:56] it's a simplicity of the gospel let's
[2:52:59] talk of the people they try to make us
[2:53:01] I'm great in the lecture of something
[2:53:02] it's the simpleness but God takes the
[2:53:05] very tool of unity and weakness and
[2:53:06] simplicity the work is work with oh my
[2:53:10] talk about the leader of the captain
[2:53:12] demons growing around powers of Devas
[2:53:14] under the name of Christianity teaching
